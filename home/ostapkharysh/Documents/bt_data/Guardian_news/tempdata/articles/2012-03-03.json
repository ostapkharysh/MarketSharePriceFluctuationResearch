      "bodyText": "Significant numbers of far-right supporters in the UK consider violence and \"armed conflict\" a legitimate form of political expression, experts will warn this week. The first audit into the attitudes and beliefs of Britain's rightwing extremists, collated in a report by the thinktank Chatham House, will reveal that there is a \"significant level of support\" for planned violent attacks. Next month the trial will begin of Anders Behring Breivik, the far-right extremist who has confessed to the murder of 77 people in Norway last July. Breivik, an Islamophobe, said he carried out the attacks on Utoya Island and Oslo to help protect Europe from a \"Muslim takeover\". The report, which polled 2,152 far-right supporters, raises concerns that the path of extremism followed by Breivik, from membership of a mainstream rightwing party to far-right terrorist, should be recognised as a possibility for UK counterparts. Matthew Goodwin, an associate fellow of Chatham House and the University of Nottingham, said there was a danger that supporters of the English Defence League (EDL), which had links to Breivik, could be tempted to become more militant. \"Perhaps some might feel that more direct, more violent strategies are the way forward.\" On 31 March the EDL will stage an international demonstration in Aarhus, Denmark's second largest city. The \"counter-jihad\" summit will discuss the formation of a European Defence League. Representatives from defence leagues in Italy, Poland, the United States, Finland, Sweden and Norway are expected to attend, along with the anti-Muslim group, Stop Islamisation of Europe. The ramifications of a well-organised, European-wide far-right movement, able to share violent ideologies and pool resources, has triggered concern from anti-fascist campaigners. Last week the Czech government warned that extreme rightwing groups were becoming more sophisticated and that neo-Nazis might resort to terrorism. Goodwin said: \"If the EDL links up with similar organisations in Germany and central and eastern Europe, that is quite worrying. Many of the grassroots groups in Germany are often called 'autonomous nationalists', but are very, very closely networked with neo-Nazi groups and organisations that engage quite openly in violence.\"",

      "bodyText": "Workers producing sportswear for Olympic sponsors Adidas, Nike and Puma are beaten, verbally abused, underpaid and overworked in Bangladeshi sweatshops, a shocking investigation has discovered. Workers for all three companies had been physically abused. In one Puma supplier, two thirds of the workers interviewed had been beaten, slapped, pushed or had their hair pulled by their managers. Women working for all Adidas and Nike factories reported sexual harassment and workers for all three companies had to work illegally long hours for less than the minimum wage. Some Adidas workers were paid as little as 9p an hour, with the average worker in all six factories investigated earning just 16p an hour. Working with the charity War on Want and researchers in Bangladesh, the Observer found that many workers had been beaten, kicked or pushed, and publicly humiliated. In one Adidas supplier factory, one in three had to work more than 80 hours a week. Workers for all three firms said they faced cruel punishments if they tried to stand up for their legal rights. Aside from the beatings, they said they were sworn at, pushed, forced to undress, humiliated by being made to stand on a table, locked in the toilet or refused permission to use the toilets. Hajera Khanom, 32, a worker in a factory supplying Puma, said: \"They have slapped, kicked and pushed me often. Calling us by abusive names is frequently done. This hurt us emotionally and mentally.\" Poppy Akter, from the same factory, said: \"I have been scolded with very bad language, slapped, pulled by the hair, made to stand on the table and threatened to be fired and sent to jail.\" Fazlul Huq, from an Adidas supplier, said managers swore at staff using \"obscene\" language. \"I have been addressed with very bad words and names. I have been hurt by my senior colleagues. The supervisors and line-chiefs do very bad things to the girls,\" she said. Many of the other women said managers made them remove the dupatta (scarf) they use to cover their breasts. Most of the workers are women. Many of them despair of ever fighting their way out of poverty. Jorina Begum, 35, who works for a Nike supplier, said: \"When I was a little girl, I dreamed of getting a decent education and leading a happy married life with a husband and children. Now I do not know what is in store for me in the future. My seven-year-old son always complains in tears about me not coming to drop or pick him up from school. But I have to be at work all day. My daily routine starts at 4 am. I wash up, then cook breakfast and lunch for the family, get my son ready for school and finally set off for work. Reaching the factory gate before 7am is compulsory. Work starts half an hour later. For nine hours I toil, with a one-hour lunch break, and start for home in the evening. It takes me more than an hour to get home on the bus.\" Adidas is the official outfitter of the London 2012 Olympics, supplying UK team uniforms designed by Stella McCartney and the uniforms for the 70,000 volunteers who will be helping to run the Games. It also sponsors many of the high-profile athletes expected to compete at the Games, including David Beckham and Jessica Ennis. Adidas hopes to sell \u00a3100m of Olympic-themed sportswear. Nike has about 18% of the \u00a34bn UK sportswear market, just ahead of Adidas, which has 15 per cent. Nike is reported to have sponsored about 25 national teams, including those of the US, China and Germany. Puma sponsors defending 100m and 200m champion Usain Bolt, along with several national teams, including Jamaica. Greg Muttitt, the campaigns and policy director at War on Want, said: \"Companies such as Adidas, Nike and Puma make huge profits from this abuse, while soiling the Olympic flag in which they wrap themselves. Let's focus on what's great about the Olympics and end the corporate free-for-all. If companies want to benefit by sponsoring teams, athletes and the Games themselves, they must ensure their workers are treated with respect.\" Investigators found that at the two factories supplying Adidas the basic salary of the lowest paid workers was an average of 72p a day. The minimum wage is equivalent to 94p a day. The legal limit for a working week in Bangladesh, including overtime, is 60 hours, with at least one day off. Two-thirds of the workers interviewed said they worked more than this. Some workers who refused lost the whole day's pay. Some worked overtime but were not paid. Factories supplying all three companies broke the law on overtime. A Nike spokeswoman said: \"Nike takes working conditions in our contract factories very seriously. All Nike suppliers must adhere to our code of conduct. We are investigating the allegations you have presented and will be back to you as soon someone in our sustainable manufacturing team has made an assessment.\" Adidas said: \"All our suppliers in Bangladesh are subject to regular audits, including monitoring visits by a women's NGO, which interviews workers and examines workplace conditions. We also run a telephone hotline to address worker complaints.\" The company said it had identified \"critical issues\" at one of the factories last year relating to working hours and wages, which resulted in enforcement action. It said the underpayment of minimum wages had been resolved by the factory. It said it was \"deeply concerned about reports of harassment or physical abuse of workers\" and would immediately launch an investigation \"to verify the allegations which are being made and to safeguard worker interests\". \"We are working closely with Nike and Puma to coordinate efforts and to respond to War on Want's report,\" a spokeswoman said. Puma said it had found evidence of illegal overtime in one of its supplier factories named in the War on Want report, but said the factory had offered assurances that it would tackle the problem. The company said it had found no evidence of any other breaches of the law. It said it paid the legal minimum wage, but WoW said it had evidence from workers that the lowest earners in the factory were paid below the legal minimum. Puma said it had was not currently using the Benetex factory as a supplier, although it confirmed that it had previously used the factory. However, Benetex appears on Puma's own current supplier list and the factory also says that it manufactures for Puma and is audited by the company. War on Want is due to release its own report into the findings later today, under the title \"Race to the bottom: Olympic sportswear companies' exploitation of Bangladeshi workers\". The group urged readers who want to support its campaign to email STOP to olympics@waronwant.org. Names have been changed",

      "bodyText": "Teenagers face far less homophobia among their peers than ever before because the stigma of being gay is melting away in secondary schools, according to a new book. The anti-gay prejudices of the 80s and early 90s are disappearing, claims Mark McCormack, a sociologist at Brunel University. McCormack spent six months in each of three schools in the same UK town to study attitudes of 16- to 18-year-olds. In his book, The Declining Significance of Homophobia: How Teenage Boys are Redefining Masculinity and Heterosexuality, he says that, for this age group, pro-gay attitudes are held in high esteem and homophobia is as unacceptable as racism. He also suggests that the phrase \"so gay\", used to rubbish things, is unrecognisable to teens as homophobic. \"A lot of prejudice is based on stigma,\" he added, \"and actually the stigma around being gay has dropped off. The coming-out narrative is changing too, with parents being OK.\" The internet had helped to dispel the isolation young gay people have felt in the past, he said. \"Twenty years ago, there were few openly gay people in the media; today, you can turn on Radio 2 and there's Graham Norton, Alan Carr, Paul O'Grady, all of whom now are mainstream. There is a fundamental change in the cultural discourse. \"An LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender] character in Coronation Street is a major thing then suddenly its forgotten then they're just a central character. It's much more accepted that there are happy gay people out there, not tortured by homophobia and prejudice.\" McCormack found teenagers to be open about their sexuality. \"It's had a huge impact on the LGBT kids: they are happy, out and proud at school. That's better for gay kids and better for straight kids too.\" But he says the change in attitude may well be peculiar to this age group: \"I'm not saying the battle is over against homophobia, but it's getting better. \"These young people see homophobia as wrong. Guys used to prove they were straight by being homophobic. Now, when young guys want to show they're straight, they do it in a more positive way by joking about being gay.\" McCormack's findings do not ring true with everyone. \"It's definitely not our experience, I'm afraid,\" said Jess Wood of youth support charity Allsorts. Its 2010 survey of Brighton schools found that 16% of bullied children in primary and 23% in secondary schools reported that the bullying was homophobic in nature.

In his book, <em>The Declining Significance of Homophobia: How Teenage Boys are Redefining Masculinity and Heterosexuality</em>, he says that, for this age group, pro-gay attitudes are held in high esteem and homophobia is as unacceptable as racism. He also suggests that the phrase \"so gay\", used to rubbish things, is unrecognisable to teens as homophobic.</p> <p>\"A lot of prejudice is based on stigma,\" he added, \"and actually the stigma around being gay has dropped off. The coming-out narrative is changing too, with parents being OK.\" The internet had helped to dispel the isolation young gay people have felt in the past, he said.</p> <p>\"Twenty years ago, there were few openly gay people in the media; today, you can turn on Radio 2 and there's Graham Norton, Alan Carr, Paul O'Grady, all of whom now are mainstream. There is a fundamental change in the cultural discourse.</p> <p>\"An LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender] character in <em>Coronation Street</em> is a major thing then suddenly its forgotten then they're just a central character. It's much more accepted that there are happy gay people out there, not tortured by homophobia and prejudice.\"</p> <p>McCormack found teenagers to be open about their sexuality. \"It's had a huge impact on the LGBT kids: they are happy, out and proud at school. That's better for gay kids and better for straight kids too.\"</p> <p>But he says the change in attitude may well be peculiar to this age group: \"I'm not saying the battle is over against homophobia, but it's getting better.</p> <p>\"These young people see homophobia as wrong. Guys used to prove they were straight by being homophobic. Now, when young guys want to show they're straight, they do it in a more positive way by joking about being gay.\"</p> <p>McCormack's findings do not ring true with everyone. \"It's definitely not our experience, I'm afraid,\" said Jess Wood of youth support charity Allsorts. Its <a href=\"http://www.allsortsyouth.org.uk\" title=\"\">2010 survey of Brighton schools</a> found that 16% of bullied children in primary and 23% in secondary schools reported that the bullying was homophobic in nature. Half of lesbian, bisexual, gay or transgender teens reported homophobic bullying at school or college.</p> <p>\"It remains the second-highest reason children give for bullying,\" said Allsorts' director, Jess Wood. \"I do think to try and eradicate the word 'gay' is a waste of time; it's embedded in the language, but it's a bogus argument to suggest it's anything other than hideous for gay people to hear the negative associations of the word.\"</p> <p>Ruth Hunt of Stonewall UK also urged caution. \"I think it matches what we know in that some schools which are good on this are very, very good.

Scholes came out of retirement in January after ending his career at the close of last season, with the 37-year-old and United initially agreeing he would play on only until the end of the current campaign. While Sir Alex Ferguson said on Friday there was no reason why the playmaker could not continue for another year, Scholes is yet to comment publicly on his plans. But Harrison, who coached the famous United youth team of Scholes, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers, told the Observer: \"I talk to Paul reasonably often and I said to him when he started again: 'Paul, you can play another season.' He said: 'Do you think so?\" I said: 'Yeah, I'm absolutely certain.' Because there's an old saying in football: 'You can't move as fast as the ball', and he makes the ball do the work. \"What happens with Paul, I think he likes somebody to tell him \u2014 not how good he is because he's been told that a million times \u2014 but for somebody to tell him he can go on longer. He still runs the game. When he came on against Manchester City [in his first game back in January] he completely ran the game. There were some great players against him, don't get me wrong [and] they could not get near him. When Xavi and [Andr\u00e9s] Iniesta say he is as good as any midfield player in the world that is a compliment because they're not bad either. \"He has certainly changed his game but I think it's for the benefit of Manchester United because we certainly still need somebody who can control the ball.\" On Friday, Ferguson said of Scholes playing on: \"It's not something I've discussed with him but on the evidence of what we've seen I don't see why he shouldn't. When I said to him last year: 'You'll give me 25 to 30 games,' that wasn't enough for him in his opinion. But I think he may look at it differently now.\"",

With the club in administration and yet to submit audited accounts for the last financial year, administrators now admit Rangers are in a race against time which they are almost certain to lose. \"The 31 March deadline is technically still possible but highly problematic, I would say,\" Whitehouse said, in what represents merely another financial blow to the troubled club. Rangers have competed in Europe during every season since 1980-81. With Rangers on the verge of making staff cuts, Whitehouse explained why a wage deferral scheme put forward by players proved unacceptable. Some players have offered to play for free until the end of this campaign. \"We have now got a significant level of interest in terms of potential purchasers,\" Whitehouse said. \"The vast majority have expressed a desire that they would wish to formulate their plans to make a bid for the business based on a materially reduced cost structure from that which currently exists, so that they can approach the business with a cleaner sheet of paper in terms of new investment. \"So what would not work during this process is to defer the cost base and create a scenario where the purchaser would inherit a large deferred cost element and the existing intact cost base, so he'd have to invest over and above that. \"We have made it very clear from the outset of this process that a deferral does not work. It is just a delayed problem, really. And in any administration there comes a time when you've got to make hard decisions for the benefit of the long-term future of the club. Deferring problems isn't dealing with them in our eyes.\" The administrator added that potential buyers have until 16 March to declare a formal interest in taking over the business. It is still to be determined what level of security the Rangers owner, Craig Whyte, holds. There remains no guarantee that the club can avoid going into liquidation and having to reform as a new company. After his team's 2-1 home loss to Hearts, Ally McCoist hinted he had been irked by comments from elsewhere. \"At the moment we are wounded,\" the Rangers manager said. \"There are probably one or two people enjoying it and having a fly kick at us.

As such Pearce, who has said he would take charge of England at the tournament but not beyond it, could retain oversight of the senior side between now and the appointment of a new manager. Pearce said: \"I prioritise as best I can. The Under-21s don't play again until September, so I'd probably put that on the back burner. The Olympics and obviously the seniors will be my priority between now and the summer.\" He said he could combine all three roles if required. \"It would be a benefit to me. I think I'd be in tournament mode and just go through the summer with it. In some ways I think it would help.\" Pearce could spend the last three months of the season looking at players who will form the basis of a squad for the Euros, before passing on to a new coach. Sir Trevor Brooking, one of the four Club England executives who will decide on the new manager, said on Wednesday that a new man could be \"parachuted in\" a few days before the tournament in Poland and Ukraine. \"I would have a good look between now and the summer and pick a squad accordingly that I felt would do us proud,\" Pearce said. He also paid tribute to Scott Parker, the Spurs player whom he made captain for the first time for the 3-2 defeat against the Dutch. \"I've been around Scott Parker now for a couple of years. I was in the pre-camp before South Africa and how he handled himself there was commendable. I've seen his relationship within the squad, around the dinner table. \"I know how unselfish he is as a player. He's been very, very good on the pitch over the last year or so and I thought he could grow with the role. That was my thinking behind making him captain.\" The former England left-back reiterated that he could not be persuaded to do the job on a long-term basis, even in the unlikely event that the side became European champions with him in charge. \"Whether we won the tournament or not would have no relevance on my thinking. I would think it's still probably too soon for me to take the job on a full-time basis, which you'll find out if you work with me over any period of time. \"I do think things through, I do make decisions that I think are right and I don't get washed away by a one-off game or anything that might come up in the summer.\" In common with pronouncements from Brooking and Alex Horne, the FA's general secretary, in recent days, Pearce defended the decision to press ahead with arrangements for the summer in the absence of a new manager. \"We need to have a process here where if a new man walks through the door everything is there for him. He doesn't need to be chasing around looking at training bases or whatever. It's common sense really, especially if someone isn't going to be approached until the Premier League season ends.\"",

      "bodyText": "Declan Kidney is taking on the look of a quiet sage in the rugby firmament. He has had his rocky moments in charge of Ireland without veering towards a proper crisis, but the former maths teacher from County Cork will be preaching calm and discipline in the dressing room at the Stade de France on Sunday afternoon. \"I think it's been more an outside view, than in the dressing room,\" he says of the bleak statistic of one Irish win in Paris in 40 years. \"They know it's in their hands. It's not a case of having to do anything different. But the French always lift their game at home. We need to concentrate and be physical for the full 80 minutes. When you have the ball, don't cough it up; when you don't have it, be rock solid in defence.\" There is no arguing with that, mundane as it might sound. But, in its simplicity, lies the unavoidable truth. So many times Ireland have gone to France with hope and returned in despair. I wondered how much responsibility, then, he leaves with the players for trying to carry out the straightforward strategy of doing everything right and nothing wrong. Quite a lot, it seems. When Ireland threw the ball about the Aviva Stadium against Italy last weekend as if it were kryptonite, more than a few observers \u2013 including the former Ireland captain Phillip Matthews \u2013 reckoned this was crazy rugby. As Kidney sees it, though: \"If you play too much of a pattern, after a game, say, or a game and a half, the opposition would, on analysis, be able to get to the fulcrum of that pattern and break it down. Then you're going to be left in no man's land. You want to have enough shape about you, to keep the width or be direct if you need to be. At the same time you need options within that structure so the players can make decisions that can exploit gaps. \"A gap can come a number of different ways. Maybe a guy drops off, maybe he slips. So you leave the decisions to [the players] in that case. The trade-off is that, if you've been out for a few weeks you come back with exuberance and you don't always get things right. But the more often we play together, the better that is. Patterned rugby is good; it is low-risk and initially it can give you more success. The rewards are down the line, I believe, as you get into the final matches.\" Certainly Matthews thought the players' on-the-spot decision to go \"too wide, too early\" was wrong. He was not alone in thinking the better option was to play their rugby much deeper in Italian territory before feeding the back line. It was not until the final third of the match that Ireland began to pull away convincingly from Italy. By that point, the attrition had taken its toll. Kidney knows the French will punish such profligacy, as they have done so often. Not since Brian O'Driscoll celebrated his first visit to Paris with a hat-trick in 2000 have the Irish played the sort of rugby to beat France in their citadel. That was their first win there since 1972. Ten years later, they beat Scotland, England and Wales for their first triple crown in 33 years \u2013 only to be thwarted in their bid for the grand slam by France in Paris. As a sporting albatross goes, that is not a bad one. Was this suspicion of lacking cohesion because of the enforced break that followed the late postponement of this fixture three weeks ago the reason he has selected the same team? \"We didn't sit down and just say we're going to pick the same team,\" Kidney says. \"We looked at each position individually, and the end result just happened to be the same team. You could say it was for consistency or continuity of performance, but it's never quite that simple.\" When Ireland went to Paris two years ago, it was on the back of a great run of success and there was even talk of back-to-back grand slams. But they gave up an early penalty, copped a yellow card and, in a twinkling, were 10 points down. \"Then we were chasing the game,\" Kidney points out. \"But you should never panic. You have to just wait for the opportunities. We are in a better place now, but so are France. They have two wins under their belt and all their league matches out of the way, and just have to focus on the next three weeks.\" While some critics panned France for giving up two tries last weekend to Scotland, not exactly a try-frenzy team, Kidney did not see many weaknesses. \"What they did is they really went after the scrum. They have huge options at the back of the scrum and the lineout. I'm sure they're looking at getting their set piece right to stifle us there. Also, they kick for territory as much as any team in the world. If you are loose, they look to exploit that in counterattack. Nothing exceptional, just really solid foundations.\" Oh, for some French flair of old. Maybe they have learned from the pain of those days, though. Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 is not a gambler. He will set up a fortress and invite the Irish to bang their heads against it until they are dizzy. The captain, Paul O'Connell, knows better than most the misery of the French experience. He has not won there in five visits. \"We've certainly played some good rugby there,\" he says, \"but usually after we've left ourselves with too big a mountain to climb. Maybe we've tried a little bit too hard in the past.\"",

      "bodyText": "Householders in flood-hit properties have been dealt a further blow in their battle to get insurance as one of the last remaining insurers willing to offer them cover has changed its stance. Sainsbury's Finance offered low-cost insurance to homeowners and tenants whose properties had previously been flooded, whereas dozens of other major insurance companies turned them away. According to the National Flood Forum, a charity offering advice and support to communities and individuals at risk of flooding, or who have been flooded, Sainsbury's appeared to offer cover to nine out of 10 people it sent its way. The policies were underwritten by Halifax Insurance. But in the past few weeks the bank has changed its underwriter to RBS Insurance, which appears to be declining the majority of flood cases the charity sees. Chris Wright, who deals with insurance queries at the National Flood Forum, says: \"Towards the end of last year around 90% of the people that came to us unable to get cover were then subsequently granted cover by Sainsbury's. Some had made phenomenal savings by going to Sainsbury's. Now we are struggling to find an insurer that stands out.\" She adds: \"Since the bank has changed underwriter our job has become so much harder. Now I understand it won't quote for anyone that has been flooded in the last 10 years.\" While many householders are struggling to get insurance, and others are offered cover at a price they cannot afford, the situation is set to even worse after June next year when a voluntary agreement between the insurance industry and the government ends. The Association of British Insurers warned earlier this year that up to 200,000 homes in England and Wales will struggle to obtain adequate flood insurance next year. The current agreement states that insurers must include flood cover as standard for properties built before 1 January 2009, where the risk of flooding is low. Crucially, insurers must also allow at-risk households who already have flood cover to renew automatically with the same insurer, as long as flood defences are planned to be in place within five years. The industry and the government are now locked in a battle over what should happen next, with insurers reluctant to continue to offer cover without government commitment on flood defences. RBS Insurance says: \"We have been working with the Association of British Insurers for several years, in an attempt to influence government regarding the provision of a sustainable national plan for flood prevention and also to maintain widely available and affordable flood insurance for all customers. The current Statement of Principles is unfair to consumers and to insurers, as it does not offer the level playing field which we all expect. This situation needs urgent attention. We will continue trying to find a solution to this dilemma, as the 2013 deadline for the termination of the Statement of Principle (flood insurance) agreement is fast approaching.\" Wendy Walters, 62, from Hull was one of the householders helped by Sainsbury's. She and her husband lost everything in the floods that hit the city in 2007, including their much loved pet budgerigar. \"The fireman had to carry me out of the property as I'm not steady on my feet,\" she says. \"We were out of the house for a year while it was repaired, but luckily our insurance covered everything.\" However, when the couple came to renew their insurance company quoted a premium of \u00a3750 with an excess of \u00a315,000. They had previously paid \u00a3250. \"We couldn't afford the premium nor the excess had we been flooded again, so we called some other major insurers, including the Halifax,\" she says. \"They all turned us down because our postcode was in a high-risk flood area.\" The Halifax was unable to explain why it could cover the Walters through a Sainsbury's policy but not its own, but said insurers often apply different underwriting criteria to their own policies compared to those they underwrite for other brands. A spokeswoman said: \"Every insurer takes a different view of risk.\" The couple contacted the National Flood Forum after hearing about it on a radio programme. The charity suggested they try Sainsbury's, which offered to insure them for \u00a3252, with a \u00a32,000 excess. \"I can't tell you what a relief it was,\" says Walters. \"We worry constantly about not being able to get cover again. Every time it rains you look out of your window and worry.\" Another Hull couple, Ron McDougall and his wife Pam, have been able to get insurance with their existing provider, Halifax, because of the agreement that existing policyholders should be able to buy cover. However, they are worried this might not be the case next year. During the 2007 flood, the McDougalls watched helplessly as the rains washed up their road, through their back and front doors and up through the fireplace. \"Within seconds we were standing in nine inches of water that then sat there for a week,\" says Ron McDougall. \"When I went out to the shed, our rabbit hutches were floating on water with the animals still in them.\" Halifax sorted out the couple's house repairs and temporary accommodation quickly, says McDougall, but inevitably this came at a cost. \"Our premium went up from about \u00a3300 to \u00a3800, though we negotiated it down to \u00a3650,\" he says. \"It is a lot of money but we tried to get insurance from a number of other companies and they were having none of it. I am concerned that we are not going to be able to sell our house if no one will insure us next year, so I'm just praying the Halifax won't turn us down.\" On Wednesday, resident's associations, actions groups and representatives of the insurance industry and the government will get together for a conference on the future of flood insurance. Charitable organisation The Joseph Rowntree Foundation will release a report that argues against insurers pricing out flood-hit households purely based on risk. It wants the government to provide a solution that protects the lowest income households from being left uninsured. In France, for example, a compulsory premium for natural disasters is standard in policies, regardless of the level of risk. \"Any just policy must find some place for social solidarity in the design of insurance arrangements for flood,\" the report will say. \"The alternative is to create a situation in which we would be predictably causing not only a sizeable swathe of blighted properties, but also very many blighted lives.\" Sainsbury's defends its decision to switch underwriters: \"Our new products, designed with the Sainsbury's shopper in mind, offer a range of quality features and benefits including unlimited buildings cover (available with our Premier Cover) and a discount of up to 15% on premiums for Nectar card holders, as well as double Nectar points on all their shopping and fuel for two years (available on our Premier Cover). \"Sainsbury's Finance, together with its partner RBS Insurance, is committed providing home insurance to as many people as possible as well as providing quality cover and a fair price.\"",

      "bodyText": "Halifax is set to raise the cost of mortgages for customers on its standard variable rate (SVR), despite it being three years since the last movement in the Bank of England base rate. The UK's largest lender, part of the Lloyds Group and partially owned by the taxpayer, will increase its SVR by 0.49% to 3.99% on 1 May, a move that will affect 850,000 customers who have all or part of their borrowing on that rate. A customer with an average balance of \u00a367,500 will typically see their repayments increase by \u00a316.40 a month, while someone owing \u00a3100,000 will typically pay \u00a324.30 more each month. The announcement came just days after Halifax wrote to 40,000 customers to tell them it was adjusting the price cap on their loans, from 3% above the Bank base rate to 3.75%. It is not increasing the SVR by that much, but retains the right to do so. Halifax said the increase was a result of market conditions, which had pushed up the cost of raising funds through retail savings and the wholesale markets. It said that while the average savings rate was 1.18% below the base rate in 2007, it had increased to 1.27% higher than the base rate, making it expensive to fund mortgages through savers' deposits. Stephen Noakes, mortgage director at Halifax, said the new rate \"more accurately reflects the cost of funding a mortgage\". David Hollingworth of mortgage broker London &amp; Country said he couldn't rule out other lenders increasing their SVRs. Ray Boulger of broker John Charcol, said Halifax customers should shop around for a cheaper rate, but acknowledged \"a number of people will find it difficult to switch lenders \u2013 perhaps they don't have enough equity, can no longer prove income or want to stay on an interest-only mortgage\". For these, the best option could be Halifax's offer to customers of a fee-free switch to a two-year fixed rate of 3.49% on borrowing up to 60%, or 3.74% on loans of up to 75%. Despite the increase, of the major lenders only Lloyds TSB and Nationwide have lower SVRs than Halifax, at 2.5%. Customers who have taken out a Halifax mortgage since January 2011 already revert to an SVR of 3.99%. RBS, also largely owned by the taxpayer, has also raised the rates applied to its One Account and offset mortgage.",

      "bodyText": "Lucy Alexander, the first Scotswoman to become a professional jumps jockey, returned to raucous approval here on Saturday after yet another success aboard Red Tanber, the horse who is expected to become her first ride at the Cheltenham Festival. Already a record-breaker, the 21-year-old Alexander is promising to carve a successful career for herself in one of the last jobs that is almost always done by men. \"She's one of the best up-and-coming jockeys I've seen in a long time,\" said Bruce Mactaggart, Red Tanber's trainer. \"There's a lot of people out there riding that are either good jockeys or good horsemen and she's both. She's very focused, very professional and, with a little bit of luck, she will make it, no problems.\" While Hayley Turner and Cathy Gannon are the big names among a strong female representation on the Flat, jump racing has no such culture. The number of women to have ridden professionally over fences in the sport's entire history would still be tiny. The Irish jockeys Nina Carberry and Katie Walsh, who have enjoyed high-profile victories in recent winters, have opted not to give up their status as amateurs. At the start of this season, Alexander had partnered two winners from 69 rides but her progress has been such that she is now up to 26 wins since May. She has already cantered through the record of 22 for a female jockey in a British jumps season, which had endured since 1980. \"I never thought for a second that it would go as well as it has,\" she says, leaning against a wall in the weighing room before racing began, as diffident in conversation as she is forceful on the track. \"I didn't really know how it was going to go. I just wanted to play it by ear and see how we got on.\" From Fife, Alexander is the daughter of Nick, a low-profile racehorse trainer, and was competing in point-to-point races from the age of 16. At the time, it was an available hobby and she had no thought of making a living from race-riding, partly, she says, because there were no role models to follow. She did well at school and made two abortive attempts on university degrees, but dropped out quickly each time and gravitated back to the sport. \"I just didn't have the interest in the subject to be doing that for four years,\" she says. \"You can always go back to university and I've got the grades from school. But I'd say I'd always do something in racing.\" Gee Armytage is still thought of as the last really successful female professional, having ridden two winners at the Cheltenham Festival in 1987. That means little to Alexander, of course, having been born three years later. But racing is a tiny world. One of the trainers who gave her a leg-up here on Saturday was Sue Bradburne, Armytage's mother-in-law. \"Injury stopped her,\" recalls Bradburne, who feels that most trainers and owners blanch at the idea of sending a woman out to face the risk of serious harm. \"When things go wrong, everyone says, oh my God, that's because she's a woman, and then they ditch you.\" Of Alexander, she says: \"She's got a real racing brain, she's a natural. You don't have to tell her what to do. At the moment, she's got that marvellous natural ability without a care in the world. She's not anticipating that the horse is going to put his foot through the next hurdle and she just rides with her heart.\" Red Tanber, at odds of 100-1 for the Jewson Chase, would be the least fancied of Alexander's possible rides at the Festival. She also hopes to be on De Boitron in the Grand Annual, Charingworth in the Byrne Group Plate and one of Jim Goldie's runners in the Martin Pipe Handicap Hurdle. She has never ridden at Cheltenham but is entirely unfazed by the famous fences and the stamina-stretching layout. \"It looks straightforward enough,\" she says. \"Obviously I am inexperienced but I wouldn't say I am worried about it. I'll speak to as many different people as I can and get as much help as I can before it, but hopefully I'll be all right.\"",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal are the new comeback kings after spectacular second-half recoveries against Tottenham and, on Saturday, Liverpool. Robin van Persie scored both the visitors' goals \u2013 the second in added time \u2013 to snatch a 2-1 win at Anfield after a game in which they had been outplayed for long periods. The result leaves Ars\u00e8ne Wenger in better heart than he would ever have expected for Tuesday night's mission impossible: overturning a four-goal, first-leg deficit against Milan in the Champions League. \"Our job now is to make the impossible possible on Tuesday,\" the Arsenal manager said. \"Maybe we were a bit lucky in beating Liverpool, but we will take results where we can and we have significantly improved our position in the last week. This result gets us away from Liverpool in a substantial way and we have shown in the last two games that we have the quality to produce something special when we need to win matches.\" The something special at Anfield was a sensational 92nd-minute winner from Van Persie, a goal of such sublime elegance that it only emphasised Liverpool's deficiencies in the finishing department. Wenger and Van Persie accepted that Liverpool dominated the game, yet even though Arsenal produced fewer goal attempts, more of them were on target. \"We could have been two or three goals down at half-time,\" Wenger said. \"The second half was more level, but we were lucky not to have been killed off by then. Liverpool are a very good side and it just shows how difficult this league is, how hard it is to even claim fourth place, but when you have a quality striker like Robin van Persie in your side you always have a chance. He is up there with the best players in the world at the moment and I am very proud of the way he has become the leader of the team.\" Wenger knows he cannot talk in such a manner without being asked questions about Arsenal's ability to keep hold of a player whose contract runs out next season and who is now admired by all the leading teams in Europe, so he was ready with the standard reply. \"You can never afford to lose a player of that quality,\" he said, diplomatically. \"Of course we will do anything possible to keep him, I have said that many times already.\" The Arsenal manager said his goalkeeper also made the difference against Liverpool, Wojciech Szczesny saving a first-half penalty, and both players echoed Wenger's view that the visitors had ridden their luck. \"We were getting killed in the first half,\" Szczesny said. \"We enjoyed the second half a lot more.\" Van Persie was even more self-deprecating. \"I don't think we deserved it to be honest,\" he said. \"Liverpool played better than we did but we nicked it at the end.\" If that verdict does not do justice to the excellence of Arsenal's winning goal, Van Persie was at least willing to pay tribute to the team-mate who supplied the pass. Alex Song had been the provider for Van Persie's previous goal of the season contender against Everton, and the Holland striker said the midfielder's vision was at least as good as his finish. \"It was another unbelievable pass from Alex,\" Van Persie said. \"He's a really good player. He can see it and he can do it as well.\"",

      "body": "<p>Arsenal are the new comeback kings after spectacular second-half recoveries against Tottenham and, on Saturday, Liverpool. Robin van Persie scored both the visitors' goals \u2013 the second in added time \u2013 to snatch a 2-1 win at Anfield after a game in which they had been outplayed for long periods.</p> <p>The result leaves Ars\u00e8ne Wenger in better heart than he would ever have expected for Tuesday night's mission impossible: overturning a four-goal, first-leg deficit against Milan in the Champions League. \"Our job now is to make the impossible possible on Tuesday,\" the Arsenal manager said. \"Maybe we were a bit lucky in beating Liverpool, but we will take results where we can and we have significantly improved our position in the last week. This result gets us away from Liverpool in a substantial way and we have shown in the last two games that we have the quality to produce something special when we need to win matches.\"</p> <p>The something special at Anfield was a sensational 92nd-minute winner from Van Persie, a goal of such sublime elegance that it only emphasised Liverpool's deficiencies in the finishing department.</p> <p>Wenger and Van Persie accepted that Liverpool dominated the game, yet even though Arsenal produced fewer goal attempts, more of them were on target. \"We could have been two or three goals down at half-time,\" Wenger said. \"The second half was more level, but we were lucky not to have been killed off by then. Liverpool are a very good side and it just shows how difficult this league is, how hard it is to even claim fourth place, but when you have a quality striker like Robin van Persie in your side you always have a chance. He is up there with the best players in the world at the moment and I am very proud of the way he has become the leader of the&#xa0;team.\"</p> <p>Wenger knows he cannot talk in such a manner without being asked questions about Arsenal's ability to keep hold of a player whose contract runs out next season and who is now admired by all the leading teams in Europe, so he was ready with the standard reply. \"You can never afford to lose a player of that quality,\" he said, diplomatically. \"Of course we will do anything possible to keep him, I have said that many times already.\"</p> <p>The Arsenal manager said his goalkeeper also made the difference against Liverpool, Wojciech Szczesny&#xa0;saving a first-half penalty, and both players echoed Wenger's view that the visitors had ridden their&#xa0;luck.</p> <p>\"We were getting killed in the first half,\" Szczesny said. \"We enjoyed the second half a lot more.\" Van Persie was even more self-deprecating. \"I don't think we deserved it to be honest,\" he said. \"Liverpool played better than we did but we nicked it at the end.\"</p> <p>If that verdict does not do justice to the excellence of Arsenal's winning goal, Van Persie was at least willing to pay tribute to the team-mate who supplied the pass. Alex Song had been the provider for Van Persie's previous goal of the season contender against Everton, and the Holland striker said the midfielder's vision was at least as good as his finish. \"It was another unbelievable pass from Alex,\" Van Persie said. \"He's a really good player. He can see it and he can do it as well.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "All great sporting double acts must one day end, the magic finally extinguished by age and its degenerative impact on athletic talent. The question is which member of the partnership will be first to fade, although in the case of the Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson Show, that long running staple of American golf, there has always been little doubt. Woods was younger, fitter and, as Mickelson had always conceded, the greater talent. The conventional wisdom was that he was bound to be around for years, relentlessly pursuing Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major wins, while his mellower left-handed rival would fade into retirement, happy with his lot. Scandal put paid to that particular narrative, although it did not shake the general belief that Woods would somehow recover his form, return to the summit and dominate all his rivals, including Mickelson. So much for this particular strand of conventional thinking, which has failed to withstand the scrutiny of the first two months of 2012. As the best players in the world head towards Miami this week for the Cadillac Championship, the latest edition of the world golf championships, Woods has never looked more ordinary, his hopes of domination undercut by a terrible fallibility on the greens. Mickelson, on the other hand, will arrive in Florida as the man to watch, the primary representative of a generation of golfers who established themselves at the turn of the last century. Woods does not appear to scare anyone these days, and certainly not the likes of Rory McIlroy. But the left-hander certainly should after his most recent performances on the PGA Tour. After a low-key start to his season, the 41-year-old has finished first and tied for second in the past two appearances in the United States, at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Northern Trust Open at Riviera Country Club, two storied tournaments staged at two storied venues. At Pebble he was matched against Woods on the final day, giving his old rival a two-shot lead at the start and beating him by nine shots with a spectacular round of 64, eight under par. So much for a man on a the downward slide. \"When I'm playing well, I make birdies and end up either in contention or winning. When I don't have it, my mistakes are going to be big. I'm going to have penalty strokes, I'm going to be back in the pack,\" he said after that Pebble Beach triumph. \"I want to try to win, and if I'm on, I usually have a good opportunity to win.\" A win this coming week at Doral, where he has won as recently as 2009, would cement Mickelson's return to the top 10 of the world rankings. More importantly, it would establish him alongside McIlroy as the favourite for next month's Masters. In a search to identify a winner of the year's first major it is hard to look past McIlroy but Mickelson is a past winner at Augusta, a course that rewards experience as much as skill. \"I have a pretty good understanding of how to play Augusta National, so it's not like I'm looking for any answers. I know how I want to attack it given each pin placement, how I want to hit it, the shots I want to hit, and now it's just a matter of refining and getting ready so that it's there when I need it,\" he said. The American has already won three Masters, and four majors in total. He is rich beyond his dreams. He could coast from here on in but despite appearances, Mickelson is not the coasting type. The past few weeks have taught his rivals, Woods included, that Mickelson will not go quietly into the night. He still has things to prove, to the world and to himself. \"You have to reset goals all the time, so I have some lofty goals now that I feel like I can attain. I want to try to win more tournaments and more major championships, and I love competing. That to me is what I really enjoy,\" he said. \"And so my motivation is I want to get those opportunities. I want to have more opportunities and see if I can finish them off.\"",

      "bodyText": "A few years ago Jeff Winter, a familiar name for any students of refereeing demonology, released an autobiography, Who's the B*****d in the Black?, which contains a particularly enlightening passage about his last match at Anfield before retiring. Winter reveals he deliberately played a bit of extra time, waiting until the ball was at the Kop end. Then, with everything in position, he blew his whistle. \"The fans behind the goal burst into spontaneous applause. It was longer and louder than normal, even for a home win. Did they know it was my final visit? Was it applause for me? They are such knowledgeable football people it would not surprise me.\" At the risk of bursting a few dreams, it is a fairly exceptional level of delusion judging by what we know of football's relationship with the referee and, specifically, the way fans tend to distrust them as their default setting. Managers are not much better and we journalists can be culpable, too, given the frequency we bring them up in press conferences, looking for a bite. Very little reasoning is applied sometimes when the blame can be redirected and the buck passed. This past week Mike Riley, the head of the Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO), set a challenge for a roomful of football writers. He played a training-ground video showing three examples of a player passing the ball, a defender holding his line and an attacker running at full sprint. It was our job to decide if it was offside and, on each occasion, at least 80% decided the flag should be raised. When the replays were slowed down it showed they were onside every time. Twice it was by the sort of distance that might have seen a manager bursting a blood vessel if it had happened in the Premier League. But it's quick. Prozone data shows top-division football is 20% faster than five years ago. A referee has to make a decision, on average, every 12 seconds. Yet they don't do too badly, as it turns out. Statistics compiled by the match delegates show referees get 92% of major decisions \u2013 goals, penalties, red cards etc \u2013 right. For assistant referees, the success rate is 99.3%. However easy it is to lapse into habit, whatever managers want us to think, our men and women in black are actually pretty good. It won't stop, of course, and we can only imagine Sir Alex Ferguson's reaction, for example, when he found out Martin Atkinson was in charge of his first Manchester United game for exactly a year when they play Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Atkinson has not had a United match since a 2-1 defeat at Chelsea that ended with Ferguson saying he should not have been appointed because the occasion needed a \"fair referee\". Ferguson's grudge against Atkinson goes back years and, for alleging bias, he was banned from the dug-out for five games, taking in his suspended penalty for accusing another referee, Alan Wiley, of being \"not fit\" and deliberately taking a 30-second breather while booking players because \"he needed a rest\". In total, Ferguson has been charged six times in five years for comments about, or to, referees. Less well known, United were one of the teams involved when assistant referees complained that substitutes were warming up suspiciously close and deliberately putting them off when their teams were attacking. These days the players have to do their stretches in the opposite direction. Yet Ferguson is not the only serial offender. Kenny Dalglish has repeatedly claimed referees have it in for Liverpool this season. Brian Marwood has sent a compilation of Manchester City's grievances to the PGMO. There is no conspiracy against their clubs, or any other club, but it makes them feel better to think otherwise. Meanwhile, the smaller clubs convince themselves that the bigger clubs get all the favourable decisions while fans alternate between Howard Webb, Stuart Attwell and Phil Dowd as the target of choice in these post-David Elleray days. Elleray was voted 18th most hated man in England and was even more unpopular at Old Trafford than Atkinson is now. His grandmother Dorothy once gave an interview to try to defend him. \"I can't stand Alex Ferguson,\" she said. This is not to say that managers and other football people are not entitled to be exasperated about mistakes. If City lose the title by a single point this season they will no doubt think back to Ji Dong-won's offside winner when they played at Sunderland in January. The linesman, on computer analysis, turned out to be 0.3 metres behind play. He had paused for a challenge on the edge of the area in case there was a foul and he had to decide if it was a penalty or merely a free-kick. At this level a split-second lapse can make all the difference. But it must be incredibly hard, now the game is faster than ever, to maintain absolute concentration over 90 minutes. The PGMO has brought in sports psychologists to work with referees but the job is not made easier when we also know so many players cheat \u2013 and not just Johnny Foreigner. Only one Premier League player has been booked twice for diving this season and it is Gareth Bale, the reigning Footballer of the Year. He may have had a third if Mike Dean had the benefit of TV replays in Tottenham's game at Arsenal last weekend. There is, however, evidence to suggest the Respect campaign is slowly getting there. For starters, bookings for dissent are down by 50% in the past three seasons. A lot of pundits like to complain the art of tackling is dying and that football will soon become a non-contact sport. Actually, the players are getting better at tackling. This season there has been a 9% increase in tackles and a 7% decrease in bookings. Riley contacted every club in the wake of all those two-footed challenges at the turn of the year to make it clear what is acceptable and what is not. After that, it stopped pretty quickly. Others say that referees should be made to explain their decisions. But their jobs are hard enough without needing media training. It is difficult, too, for a referee to explain a red card when there may be an appeal. Plus there is generally very little to talk about. They started bringing out referees to press conferences in Spain and it lasted only a month before everyone got bored of it. No, it would be far better, as unfashionable as it is, if Ferguson, Dalglish and all the rest moved on from all the half-baked conspiracy theories. Though, plainly, it won't happen. Managers will continue to misdirect the blame and the boo-boys will carry on with their zombie ways. It is tedious in the extreme. Most of all, it is unfair on the people, to quote one former sports minister, who stand between the game and chaos. Unless those doing the criticising can say they get between 92 and 99.3% of their own decisions right.",

Much energy has been expended in chat rooms and pubs discussing what they did differently as well as, no doubt, in the England camp itself. But we can spend as much time as we like staring at whiteboards and listening to subtle analyses of patterns and combinations \u2013 the main thing England did differently was to field a 17-stone bundle of muscle and attitude at outside centre. Manu Tuilagi was reintroduced to England's line-up, seething from his experiences at the World Cup, refreshed and yet further frustrated by an enforced lay-off with a smashed face and then a pulled hamstring, and finally wound up by all this talk of enormous threequarters \u2013 in the Wales team. \"I was really excited coming into the game,\" he says with a smouldering grin. \"Everyone was talking about their big backs. But that is a big challenge. We [he and his centre partner Brad Barritt] love that, and I feel we did really well in stopping them. We'd talked about it all week \u2013 Jamie Roberts, Jonathan Davies, George North, you name them. You've just got to get there first and win the gainline. I think we did that.\" It was indeed an oversight on our part to forget that England were bringing back something of a wrecking ball themselves, or to forget that his new comrades in the England midfield were defenders of more than willing persuasion. After his explosive introduction to English rugby last season, things had gone a little quiet on the Manu Tuilagi front. In his first game back for Leicester after the World Cup, a clash of heads put him out of action for around eight weeks, and three games into his comeback from that he pulled a hamstring to cost him another six weeks. Those who saw his contribution to Leicester's win at Saracens the week before the Wales game might have had a sense of what was coming, but it was impressive to see how well he picked up the international pace after his recent injuries. \"I was pleased with his contribution to the game, given the fact he had played so little,\" says Stuart Lancaster, England's caretaker coach. \"Since then he has got more involved in training and has more of an understanding of our systems. He is a fantastic young player, isn't he? He's 20 years old, and the more we can get these lads on to the international field the better.\" Notwithstanding the way North charged through the England defence in the first minute, albeit closer to the fringes than to Tuilagi's beat in midfield, Wales's heavyweight threequarters were contained well for the rest of the game. Tuilagi enjoyed a purple patch of destructiveness in the second quarter, announcing himself to the game when he ran clean through the heaviest of all the Welsh behemoths, Roberts \u2013 at 17st 4lb, the same weight as Tuilagi, even if he is three inches taller. The irony is that a riveting contest was eventually won by the lightest of Wales's threequarters, Scott Williams, a replacement for the heaviest, and that he scored his try by ripping the ball from one of England's biggest forwards. The pain of that recollection furrows Tuilagi's brow. \"We could have won. We should have won.\" But pain is something he wears lightly. He comes from Samoa, after all, where rugby is served raw. He moved to the UK at the age of 12, where his famous rugby-playing brothers were plying their trade. For a few months, in 2009 and 2010, he lived at risk of deportment, once the authorities had caught up with the fact that he had arrived on a six-month holiday visa and never left. \"I was still in school at the time,\" he says. \"I'm a chilled-out guy, and I just took it day by day. I always knew it was there, but when I got on the pitch it was different. On the pitch, I just forget about everything. I remember the day my academy manager at Leicester rang to tell me it was all sorted. I just screamed. As loud as I could. I was holding my little niece at the time.\" That was Alesana's daughter, but another niece has been preparing him for his next challenge \u2013 against the French next Sunday. \"My brother Henry's kids speak French fluently. [Henry has been playing for Perpignan since 2007.] I went over to see him for his birthday, and his daughter Alessandra taught me some words. How to say 'You're beautiful'.\" The flaxen locks The flaxen locks of his likely opposite number in Paris, Aurelien Rougerie, may well have moved a few to make the same observation, but Tuilagi is unlikely to find himself trotting out such a line next week. Their collision would be another mighty clash of titans, with no time for small talk, particularly in light of their previous meeting: England's defeat to France in the quarter-finals of the World Cup. \"The sadness and disappointment that I felt after that game I can't put into words,\" says Tuilagi. So much so that his actions in the aftermath caused headlines, as he became the latest Englishman to lose his discipline at the World Cup, taking a dip in Auckland harbour, where collision with a carrier hurts more than with any Welsh threequarter. And the principal doubts over Tuilagi's game centre around his youthful impetuosity and the tendency to break rank, as his team-mate Chris Ashton could testify. Tuilagi swears those days are behind him. \"They can try to wind me up,\" he says of the French, \"but there's no point. It's not going to happen.\" It sounds as if he is learning to settle into those systems and patterns they draw up on the whiteboards. Any pattern incorporating a specimen like Manu Tuilagi is one to be reckoned with.",

      "bodyText": "Like Lennon and McCartney, the hits keep coming for Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. The two masters of Old Trafford scored the goals in Manchester United's 2-1 win at Norwich City last Sunday and their genius will be thrust to the fore at Tottenham Hotspur. In the Premier League match that Sir Alex Ferguson has marked as one to \"survive\", the United manager will trust the pair with 1,587 senior appearances between them to steer his title-chasing side in the cauldron of a Sunday afternoon at White Hart Lane. How Giggs and Scholes have kept on running for so long is a small miracle, and may spawn countless sport science theses in future years. Diet, yoga, a recalibration of their games \u2013 United's ambition is that their players should emulate Milan's for longevity. Other factors such as leaving international football early and the shock of premature retirement \u2013 in Scholes's case \u2013 are additional factors keeping their distinguished veterans in peak condition. Primarily, the Premier League's longest-running show speaks of Giggs's and his younger sidekick's adoration for the buzz of competition. \"Without a doubt the biggest thing is a love of football \u2013 that's what kept them going so long,\" says Eric Harrison, the United youth-team coach who brought through the fabled group of Giggs, Scholes, David Beckham, the Neville brothers and Nicky Butt. \"They just love training and playing football. Even though they're getting on a bit they are still important for Manchester United \u2013 it's unbelievable.\" Giggs will be 39 in November and has already signed on for another season, which will be his 22nd at Old Trafford. Scholes has not yet decided whether he will follow his decision in January to take his boots out of storage by playing on into next term, which would be a 19th campaign. While both United and Scholes have made no commitment beyond this season, Harrison offers a clue that the 37-year-old may not consider this his valedictory tour. \"I talk to Paul reasonably often and I said to him when he started again: 'Paul, you can play another season.' He said: \"Do you think so?\" I said: 'Yeah, I'm absolutely certain.' Because there's an old saying in football, 'You can't move as fast as the ball', and he makes the ball do the work.\" A telling insight into a man famously camera and notebook shy, the humble appreciation of his good fortune in being able to continue playing professional football at the highest level into his late 30s is a trait Scholes shares with Giggs. It has also been key in their ability to move on to the next training session, the next game, the next challenge. Harrison adds: \"What happens with Paul, I think he likes somebody to tell him \u2013 not how good he is, because he's been told that a million times \u2013 but for somebody to tell him he can go on longer.\" Each has benefited from focusing on United. Scholes has 66 caps and last played for England at Euro 2004. Giggs wore the Welsh dragon 64 times before retiring five years ago. A willingness to adapt and accept their careers have turned to autumn has also added further years to their time on the pitch. Of Giggs, Ferguson says: \"He's changed his position to more central and that's created a different aspect to his game. What Ryan was always famous for was going up and down that touchline. Today it's a different Giggs. He probably looks at his game in a different way.\" Harrison says of Scholes's reinvention: \"He has changed. Not into a defensive midfield player \u2013 he'll never be a defensive midfield player \u2013 but to one who completely runs the game for Manchester United. When Xavi and [Andr\u00e9s] Iniesta [of Barcelona] say he is as good as any midfield player in the world that is a compliment because they're not bad either.\" Giggs and Scholes have benefited from being at a forward-thinking club, where there has been a willingness to embrace the latest moves in sport science. According to the recently retired Gary Neville, in 2007 a presentation was given about MilanLab, the famed sport science department of the Rossoneri, and the club's medical staff visited the facility two years later. Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta, who both retired at 41, were held up as the ideals by United who hoped their players might age like fine wine. Jean-Pierre Meersseman founded MilanLab in the early noughties and explains how careers can be extended: \"Genetic factors, first of all, are important. I don't know Giggs or Scholes but I would imagine they would live an athletic life. You can have the best body in the world but if you don't take care of it properly and you don't live like an athlete should you're going to be worn out before the others, that's for sure.\" Harrison confirms: \"They had to sacrifice \u2013 they couldn't live the life that their pals did. I could trust them 100%, they'd always turn up for training on time, they were fit, they looked after themselves, they lived their lives like professional footballers should. \"It just shows how their diet has been important for them, really, and they've basically just made sure that every day they come into training they're ready for whatever Sir Alex Ferguson puts in front of them and for games.\" Yoga, introduced to Giggs by Roy Keane, stopped his perennial hamstring problems. \"It did Ryan an awful lot of good,\" Harrison says. \"I can't remember the last time he had a hamstring [issue] so there must be something in it.\" Yoga constitutes a pre-emptive strike against injury, the approach which United will have also noted from their studies of Milan Lab. \"We play the role of prevention,\" Meersseman adds. \"Trying to figure out possible injuries before they actually happen and taking care of them in a slightly different way \u2013 essentially it's a chiropractor approach [as] I'm a chiropractor. So what we do is pay particular attention to the spine, we pay a lot of attention to other structures, for instance the feet, the way of walking, their shoes, their feet. \"Basically, it's nothing more than that: a lot of attention to metabolic factors, molecular factors and psychological factors and that's what it's all about. That was the information given to Manchester United.\" Expert information was what Scholes imparted to the reserve team he helped coach for the first half of the season before playing with them made him realise that he had retired too early. When Scholes told Ferguson he had made a mistake, it was an easy decision for the manager to offer him back his place in the first-team squad. \"Warren Joyce, the reserve-team coach, would encourage him to join in with the players,\" Harrison says. \"So the boss knew he was fairly fit when he made that decision that he wanted to come back.\" Now Scholes has joined Giggs again as the manager's on-field lieutenants. \"They're very important players for Sir Alex Ferguson because they virtually run the dressing room at Carrington for training. All the players have to do is look \u2013 they were role models, they give the young players a lot of help.\" Tom Cleverley, the young midfielder who is a member of the next group of United graduates making an impact, confirms: \"Giggsy does give you tips, especially when you're playing at certain grounds, which is helpful. If you asked which of their qualities I most admire I would say Giggsy's awareness and Scholesy's passing range.\" How much longer, then, for the still dynamic duo? \"Ryan's a football nut, you could ask him questions about foreign teams and players and he seems to have the answers,\" Harrison says. \"If he finishes it will be a [shock] because he gets bored after 10 minutes apart from when he's playing football.\" So, too, Scholes, it seems.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Alex Ferguson is preparing his farewells for Harry Redknapp in recognition of the fact that Sunday's game at White Hart Lane is likely to be the last time the two managers meet as rivals. The Tottenham Hotspur manager is almost certain to be offered the vacant England post before the start of next season and, like most other observers, Ferguson believes he will accept it. \"I think this will be the last time we meet in the league,\" the Manchester United manager said. \"I think it's inevitable that Harry will get the England job, I really do. I don't see anyone else in the frame. I know the FA are supposed to be drawing up a list and all the rest of it, but everybody knows who the press and the public want. The FA don't want the press against them, they would be panicking then. The drive and energy is all behind Harry, and I think he would be the right choice.\" Ferguson has expressed admiration for Redknapp's team so often in recent months that one suspects his private advice might be to turn down the national team and go for glory with Spurs, though he recognises that for a proud traditionalist the England job is the ultimate managerial accolade. While Ferguson believes Spurs will cope with the loss in the short term, he feels a manager of Redknapp's experience is bound to be missed eventually. \"You are talking about a manager who has changed the whole club around in a fairly short time, put together a team full of talent,\" he said. \"He will leave a strong, young squad and a lot of good players, there is no doubt about that, but over time his personality and experience will be missed. Because the squad is a good age I could see Spurs keeping their momentum initially, but with a new manager they might have to start all over again.\" After the superficial similarities in age and outlook, there does not appear to be that much common ground between the two managerial careers, though as befits a prospective England manager Redknapp has a lifetime's knowledge of English football and an ability to project his personality. One could easily think of a few recent England appointments who would fall at one or both of those hurdles, but Ferguson believes that at any level of management a strong personality is at least as important as an understanding of the game, especially in modern football where players have often made their first million before making the first team. \"Footballers have changed a lot in our lifetimes, and so has the job of managing them,\" Ferguson said. \"Everyone does things differently, and Harry's way of dealing with players has obviously been successful, but I don't think there's a secret to longevity as a manager. \"The key thing is to make sure your personality is the most important one at the club. The minute you allow players to dominate you or demonstrate a stronger personality then you are struggling. I have never had any issues on that score and I think Harry is probably the same.\" United have an enviable record both home and away against Spurs in the Premier League, and perhaps because Sunday afternoon's game is his last against a top-six club until the showdown at the Etihad at the end of April, Ferguson is claiming the result could have a huge bearing on the title race. Manchester City are still ahead at the top, though their run-in is somewhat more demanding, with games against Arsenal and Chelsea and awkward trips to Stoke, Swansea, Norwich and Newcastle. \"On paper it might be tougher but it's best not to take anything for granted,\" Ferguson said. \"I don't think any game is particularly easy if it is in the run-in, because pressure begins to have an effect and the other team might have something to play for too. I don't see either City or ourselves dropping too many points between now and the end of the season, but I am sure points will be dropped. They always are. You never know, maybe progress in the Europa League will prove to be a deciding factor. \"From our point of view, the Spurs game is our most important so far. If we can survive at White Hart Lane it will be a question of trying to keep our momentum going until we reach the City game. If we are still in striking distance by then it will be a best-man-wins type of situation at the Etihad, and that is not the worst scenario for us. I'd settle for that.\"",

      "bodyText": "Seconds out, round two. Jessica Ennis and Russia's Tatyana Chernova resume their duel next week, going head to head in the pentathlon at the World Indoor Championships in Istanbul. The last time they were on a track together was in South Korea in August 2011, at the finish line of the 800m. Back then Chernova was grinning and Ennis was grimacing. She had just lost her world heptathlon title. Ennis had beaten Chernova in the four major championships they had competed in together to that point, but this was different. Chernova has only just turned 24 and she is only beginning to realise the potential she had shown when she won the world youth and junior championships back to back in 2005 and 2006. Her winning score in Daegu was 57 points beyond Ennis's own personal best. At that point, Ennis has said, things changed. All of a sudden people stopped asking her \"Are you going to win gold?\" in 2012, and started saying: \"Can she win gold?\" In Istanbul, where Ennis will try to defend her world pentathlon title, we will get the beginnings of an answer. \"Anything can happen on the day\" is an underdog's mantra, beloved by those seeking to give themselves succour when they start as the second favourite. In multi-event athletics, though, it does not quite hold true. Sure, you can hit a hurdle or stumble in a sprint, but over two days of competition luck plays less of a role. In Daegu Ennis said that her poor performance in the javelin cost her the gold medal, and there was some talk about her slipping on a wet patch of track. But the truth is that even if she had equalled her own personal best in that event, she would still have needed to beat Chernova by 0.16sec in the 800m to win gold. And that would have been tough, because Chernova is over a second quicker than Ennis around two laps of the track. To cut it another way: at her best, Chernova is better. If you tally up the scores for their respective PBs over the seven events of the heptathlon, Chernova wins by 43 points. Chernova's PB over the 800m was set at the Beijing Olympics, when she was trying to make up a 158-point gap on the USA's Hyleas Fountain, who was in third after six events. To do that Chernova needed to beat Fountain by 10 seconds. She did not, quite, but she almost killed herself trying. \"I sped up from the very start,\" she remembers. \"And what I felt then I think I will remember all my life. Open my eyes \u2013 and see only the track ahead, endless track; every lap \u2013 look at the time, count, and again track, track, track \u2026 On the last metres I could hardly feel my legs. After the finish I did not even look at the time. I fell down to the ground and was praying.\" The story shows that Chernova, whose father was a decathlete and whose mother a 400m runner, is not just a natural athlete, but a ferocious competitor. As is Ennis. Great Britain's head coach, Charles van Commenee, has said that Ennis \"is more challenged than ever before\" but reckons that the defeat \"is not a problem so long as she learns lessons from it\". The fascinating thing about Istanbul \u2013 where Ennis will have a distinct advantage because the javelin is not part of the pentathlon \u2013 will be what it tells us about the improvements both she and Chernova have made over the winter. Ennis has said that she has been using a picture of the two of them at the 800m finish line in Daegu as a motivational tool. It has worked. Her form in the indoor season has been impressive. At the Aviva Grand Prix in Birmingham she knocked 0.08sec off her PB in the 60m hurdles, which is worth 19 extra pentathlon points. Ennis and her coach, Toni Minichiello, have been working on her start. She keeps lower when she comes out of the blocks and drives herself harder over the first three hurdles. She will need to carry that improvement over into the outdoor season. \"Do you think Tatyana will be checking your results on the internet?\" Ennis was asked after that race. \"She might be having a sneaky peek,\" Ennis replied, with a chuckle. If Chernova did see Ennis's PB, she responded in the best possible way. Six days later at the Russian indoor championships, she broke her own PB in the event and by a huge amount. Chernova brought it down from 8.22sec to 8.02sec, an improvement worth 46 points. Suddenly Ennis's 19-point gain does not seem so significant. Ennis is also better than Chernova in the high jump, the 200m and the shot. So far this season Ennis has had one outing in the high jump, when she cleared 1.91m at the UK trials. That was 4cm shy of her PB, but pleased her because her goal is to consistently clear 1.90m in major competition. She produced a reasonable performance in the shot put that same weekend, reaching 14.09m after saying that her target was just to clear 14m dead. Right now she is trying to ensure she can rely on her strongest events as well as improving in her weaker ones. Ennis has been working with the former javelin thrower Mick Hill to improve her technique, but the fruits of that will not become clear until the outdoor season. She has notched 6.47m in the long jump this season, but the consistency she is seeking has been elusive there so far. There are other contenders out there, including Chernova's compatriot Ekaterina Bolshova, who has come from nowhere to set the world's leading pentathlon score so far this season. But there is only one who is better on paper and in practice than Ennis \u2013 Chernova. Just recently Ennis has been downplaying her rivalry saying she does not want to become obsessed with it. But it is going to shape her year, and her career. Nothing spurs an athlete or stirs a crowd like a great rivalry, and that's what we have here.",

      "bodyText": "There was a time, just as Super Rugby began to assault all the givens about protection of possession, when the Six Nations looked a bit like the game's spluttering colonel, unyielding in his old beliefs and not very quick on his feet. And yet, here we are, with two full rounds and Sunday's rearranged France-Ireland tie to go, and the old boy is looking good, marching on with quite a swagger. No sooner had the International Rugby Board presented their remarkably unsurprising findings on the efficacy of size in a game of physical contact and Scotland had responded by selecting the Cairngorms as a back division against France, than Stuart Hogg, anything but a towering specimen at full-back, was lighting up Murrayfield. High tempo is still as potent as high kilos. Of course, Scotland lost. Round three was not their turning point after all. But France ended up trying to work Lionel Beauxis into position for a drop at goal, a sure sign that this had been a lot more difficult than it might have been. And that is exactly how it should be, tight games between more or less equals, decided by the better performance on the day. France stopped Scotland recycling ball quickly, a tribute to the remarkable Thierry Dusautoir, a specialist at work in the Scottish lowlands, from the hem of the kilt to ground level. His power in the tackle allowed France to put a minimum number of forwards into the rucks and determined that Scotland were always running at a replenished defensive line. Scotland, too, had their ways of stopping France, and Ross Rennie again proved what an expert he has become at ripping the ball clear \u2013 stripping \u2013 from the arms of even the biggest ball\u2011carriers. Scott Williams in the defining moment of the England\u2011Wales game was the most celebrated example (on one side of the border) of how a centre can redden the face of a giant such as Courtney Lawes, but Rennie has been executing the action of grab\u2011and\u2011tear all year. Ireland are equally proficient at the choke-and-hold tackle. They are the clampers of the game, utterly infuriating to people on the move. They seize and Paul O'Connell shouts: \"Maul, maul,\" at the referee, who responds by giving them the put-in at the scrum. Stripping and clamping have become specialist techniques in the Six Nations, not entirely new, but honed to perfection. They are skills, like Charlie Hodgson's charge-downs, that are part of the furniture, but, practised zealously until they become a new threat. It is a shame that nobody has found an old skill and buffed it up in a thoroughly modern way to sort out the ills of the scrum. France also slammed Scotland here, with Nicolas Mas putting in a performance that puts him up there with Wales's Adam Jones as their countries' most valuable players. The tighthead prop was proof of the enduring power of the first among rugby's set pieces, but all the resets and slewing and lectures and collapsing made for uneasy viewing and listening. It is still anathema to have one law for professional players and another for more humble participants, and the safety of front-row forwards who may not know too much about the frightening forces at work in the scrum is paramount. But protecting the players at a low level is making a mess of the game at the top. Up here, props could be allowed to blast away with an abandon that would include dishing out their own internal justice. Referees, ever ignorant of what truly goes on in the front row, could turn a blind eye. The outside, visible game would flow more smoothly. Promoting vigilantism is not really going to get many votes in the chamber of the IRB and it seems we are stuck with what we have, a time-wasting shambles, extended periods of rest between resets, at the very time when everything else in the game is geared towards improving the ball-in-play figures. I suppose the hope is that, as the breakdown grows as the true point of contest for possession, the scrum will cease to be relevant. If self-policing by summary clouting is a no-no, then we may not be too far from the order of a free-kick for knock-ons and forward passes. At least it would speed things up. How strange it would be if teams were awarded a relieving free-kick and chose to scrummage, for old times' sake or, more likely, to have a breather. Meanwhile, we must suffer. Breather? You can take a siesta during \"Crouch, touch, pause, engage\" as the words are intoned at the moment. Sunday is bonus day, the reset meeting of France and Ireland. It was born in controversial, frost-bound chaos, typical of the ancient ways of the spluttering colonel. But it is a welcome addition to his schedule: the clampers against the minimalist ruckers. How thoroughly modern.",

      "body": "<p>There was a time, just as Super Rugby began to assault all the givens about protection of possession, when the Six Nations looked a bit like the game's spluttering colonel, unyielding in his old beliefs and not very quick on his feet. And yet, here we are, with two full rounds and Sunday's rearranged France-Ireland tie to go, and the old boy is looking good, marching on with quite a swagger.</p> <p>No sooner had the International Rugby Board presented their remarkably unsurprising findings on the efficacy of size in a game of physical contact and Scotland had responded by selecting the Cairngorms as a back division against France, than Stuart Hogg, anything but a towering specimen at full-back, was lighting up Murrayfield. High tempo is still as potent as high kilos.</p> <p>Of course, Scotland lost. Round three was not their turning point after all. But France ended up trying to work Lionel Beauxis into position for a drop at goal, a sure sign that this had been a lot more difficult than it might have been. And that is exactly how it should be, tight games between more or less equals, decided by the better performance on the day.</p> <p>France stopped Scotland recycling ball quickly, a tribute to the remarkable Thierry Dusautoir, a specialist at work in the Scottish lowlands, from the hem of the kilt to ground level. His power in the tackle allowed France to put a minimum number of forwards into the rucks and determined that Scotland were always running at a replenished defensive line.</p> <p>Scotland, too, had their ways of stopping France, and Ross Rennie again proved what an expert he has become at ripping the ball clear \u2013 stripping \u2013 from the arms of even the biggest ball\u2011carriers. Scott Williams in the defining moment of the England\u2011Wales game was the most celebrated example (on one side of the border) of how a centre can redden the face of a giant such as Courtney Lawes, but Rennie has been executing the action of grab\u2011and\u2011tear all year.</p> <p>Ireland are equally proficient at the choke-and-hold tackle. They are the clampers of the game, utterly infuriating to people on the move. They seize and Paul O'Connell shouts: \"Maul, maul,\" at the referee, who responds by giving them the put-in at the scrum. Stripping and clamping have become specialist techniques in the Six Nations, not entirely new, but honed to perfection. They are skills, like Charlie Hodgson's charge-downs, that are part of the furniture, but, practised zealously until they become a new threat.</p> <p>It is a shame that nobody has found an old skill and buffed it up in a thoroughly modern way to sort out the ills of the scrum. France also slammed Scotland here, with Nicolas Mas putting in a performance that puts him up there with Wales's Adam Jones as their countries' most valuable players. The tighthead prop was proof of the enduring power of the first among rugby's set pieces, but all the resets and slewing and lectures and collapsing made for uneasy viewing and listening.</p> <p>It is still anathema to have one law for professional players and another for more humble participants, and the safety of front-row forwards who may not know too much about the frightening forces at work in the scrum is paramount. But protecting the players at a low level is making a mess of the game at the top. Up here, props could be allowed to blast away with an abandon that would include dishing out their own internal justice. Referees, ever ignorant of what truly goes on in the front row, could turn a blind eye. The outside, visible game would flow more smoothly.</p> <p>Promoting vigilantism is not really going to get many votes in the chamber of the IRB and it seems we are stuck with what we have, a time-wasting shambles, extended periods of rest between resets, at the very time when everything else in the game is geared towards improving the ball-in-play figures. I suppose the hope is that, as the breakdown grows as the true point of contest for possession, the scrum will cease to be relevant.</p> <p>If self-policing by summary clouting is a no-no, then we may not be too far from the order of a free-kick for knock-ons and forward passes. At least it would speed things up. How strange it would be if teams were awarded a relieving free-kick and chose to scrummage, for old times' sake or, more likely, to have a breather. Meanwhile, we must suffer. Breather? You can take a siesta during \"Crouch, touch, pause, engage\" as the words are intoned at the moment.</p> <p>Sunday is bonus day, the reset meeting of France and Ireland. It was born in controversial, frost-bound chaos, typical of the ancient ways of the spluttering colonel. But it is a welcome addition to his schedule: the clampers against the minimalist ruckers. How thoroughly modern.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday 2 March 2011, our lives changed for ever. Our beloved 21-year-old daughter, Louise, who had everything to live for, drowned in her bath after taking an unintentional overdose of ketamine. She was not a regular drug user; she was a gregarious, popular, fun-loving girl who, as I said in my obituary in the Guardian, \"achieved more in her 21 years than most of us do in a lifetime\". She had been, variously, a DJ, a dancer, a photographer, a fashion student, and was on the point of taking a degree in fine art. She was loved by everyone she knew as she lit up their \u2013 and our \u2013 lives with her kindness and generosity. A year on, many people ask how I have coped; my reply is that you have two choices: to curl up under the duvet for a year or try to do something positive. When Louise died, I knew immediately that she would want me to stop others from losing their lives in such a stupid and pointless way; I owed it to her memory and I knew that she would live on through my actions. I was lucky in that Louise had been happy to have me as a friend on Facebook. It kept us close even when we were miles apart or just round the corner, and through it I had come to know quite a few of her friends. On the morning of her death, instinctively I posted the following message: \"My darling Louise was found drowned in her bath this morning. Please help me/us in any way you can.\" As the horrible manner of her death began to sink in, I put out another message on Facebook: \"Friends of Louise: this is her mum: I expect by now you know she drowned in her bath in the early hours of weds morning. She had taken ketamine so when she decided to watch a DVD in the bath she just fell under and never woke up. What a pointless and stupid way for our lovely girl to leave us and lose everything that was yet to come. My real message here is: PLEASE STOP WASTING YOUR LIVES BY TAKING DRUGS THEY KILL.\" As a media professional, I knew what I had to do: I asked every person who received this message to post it on their walls, so we could start a viral campaign. So began an extraordinary journey of love, support, friendship, which continues to this day and has propelled my campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of drug use. Louise's friends, despite the age gap, have been wonderful; we regularly chat online and remember her, we swap photos and memories; we celebrated her birthday on a freezing night on Primrose Hill with fireworks containing her ashes and Chinese lanterns; they collected for a bench in Camden, and wrote the inscription: \"In loving memory of Louise 'Little Lou' Cattell whose glowing creative spirit still graces these streets. Donated by those she inspired.\" They have organised a memorial gig at Dingwalls on Wednesday; Tim Arnold \u2013 \"The Soho Hobo\" \u2013 is releasing a single in her memory, Little London Lou, which will be premiered at the concert. My husband Ross has built a tribute website, celebrating Louise's life but also aimed at raising awareness of the risks of ketamine. The January traffic alone was more than 5,000 unique visitors and 180,000 hits. Facebook and the internet provide a constant medium to spread the word about the dangers of drugs while keeping her memory alive. Louise's death was widely and inaccurately reported in the press. I realised that, rather than be ambushed, we should take the real story to the press, so on 17 April the Observer published an article, \"Every parent's worst nightmare \u2013 how ketamine killed my daughter\". Soon my phone was hot with calls for interviews and articles \u2013 we even had the Mail and the Telegraph trying to outbid each other \u2013 and I made a conscious decision to devote a year of my life to raising awareness of the dangers of ketamine. Despite this assertive action, not all the press was friendly \u2013 one national newspaper even doorstepped us on the day of her funeral \u2014 and I filed four complaints through the Press Complaints Commission. In compensation, I negotiated columns and articles in Louise's memory, warning people about ketamine. It was in response to one of these, an article I wrote in the Evening Standard, that Maryon Stewart called me. Maryon started the Angelus Foundation after her 21-year-old daughter Hester died from a combination of a small amount of alcohol and a half-dose of GBL, a legal high. Legal highs are commonly available chemical substances, such as plant food, bath salts and nail varnish remover, which are bought by and sold to kids \"legally\" despite their enormous potential to maim and even kill. In the wake of Hester's death, Maryon had campaigned tirelessly and successfully to get GBL banned, then mephedrone (commonly known as miaow miaow or MCat), but she realised that no sooner is one substance banned than a host of others replace it. In 2010, 41 new psychoactive substances were officially notified; in 2011, there were estimated to be as many but, since the government cut funding to laboratories, no one knows what's in most of these white powders, which are quite often class B drugs cut with chemicals, nor what harm they can cause. But there is no doubt that many people are becoming sick, and even dying, from drugs such as ketamine, ivory wave, ecstasy, bubble, mephedrone \u2013 all of which seem to vary from batch to batch. I was invited to join the board of trustees, which I gladly did, as I felt it was pointless to continue to lobby against ketamine on my own, when there is a reputable group, consulted by the Home Office and parliamentary committees on drug-related issues, and that, together with my extensive networks, we could campaign even more effectively. In the autumn we made a breath-taking discovery: that the coalition government, in its recent curriculum review, had abandoned Labour's bill to make the PSHE (personal, social and health education) curriculum compulsory, including drug education. This means that every school can decide how much curriculum time it wants to devote to drug education (for more than 60% of schools that means one hour or less a year), what the curriculum is (one recent study found that 70% of pupils couldn't recall any drug education in their secondary school), and who delivers it (it might be the PE teacher, the school nurse, and often it is a police officer or an ex-user who does an assembly). Most important, schools will not be measured on whether what they teach is successful or not. Research shows that drug education, poorly taught, can increase the use of drugs. So we decided to team up with the Amy Winehouse Foundation to launch a parents' petition to lobby government to make drug education part of the national curriculum. This campaign is being launched at the House of Commons on Monday. We will demand that every child receives an approved drug education, which can be measured in terms of efficacy. There are already several programmes in use in Canada, Australia and Sweden, which have demonstrated a reduction in drugs and alcohol use of anything between 20% and 40%. We will also be lobbying for a separate ministry of drugs, reporting to the prime minister, as in France, where the use of hard drugs has dropped significantly since its inception, and drug deaths in 2008 were 10% of the UK total. Currently drug issues are shared out between Home Office, health and education \u2013 but are not at the top of anyone's priority list in these straitened times. Meanwhile, the work of Angelus goes on: we are making films with families bereaved by the loss of loved ones to drugs; of people who have been maimed, permanently or temporarily, and plan to roll them out in schools as a supplementary part of a drug education programme, and on the internet; we are researching optimum ways to communicate to young people; we are providing tips, information and scripts for parents to help them talk sensibly to their kids about drugs. Sadly, as with most charities, funding is a nightmare; applications to foundations and trusts take for ever to come through, but we feel we cannot stand and wait. We have to act now to try to save other families from a loss such as ours. To do so means that Louise's life \u2013 and her death \u2013 take on an extra meaning; it provides a little comfort in an otherwise darker world.",

It was in response to one of these, an article I wrote in the <em>Evening Standard</em>, that Maryon Stewart called me.</p> <p>Maryon started <a href=\"http://www.angelusfoundation.com\" title=\"http://www.angelusfoundation.com\">the Angelus Foundation</a> after her 21-year-old daughter Hester died from a combination of a small amount of alcohol and a half-dose of GBL, a legal&#xa0;high.</p> <p>Legal highs are commonly available chemical substances, such as plant food, bath salts and nail varnish remover, which are bought by and sold to kids \"legally\" despite their enormous potential to maim and even kill. In the wake of Hester's death, Maryon had campaigned tirelessly and successfully to get GBL banned, then mephedrone (commonly known as miaow miaow or MCat), but she realised that no sooner is one substance banned than a host of others replace it.</p> <p>In 2010, 41 new psychoactive substances were officially notified; in 2011, there were estimated to be as many but, since the government cut funding to laboratories, no one knows what's in most of these white powders, which are quite often class B drugs cut with chemicals, nor what harm they can cause. But there is no doubt that many people are becoming sick, and even dying, from drugs such as ketamine, ivory wave, ecstasy, bubble, mephedrone \u2013 all of which seem to vary from batch to batch.</p> <p>I was invited to join the board of trustees, which I gladly did, as I felt it was pointless to continue to lobby against ketamine on my own, when there is a reputable group, consulted by the Home Office and parliamentary committees on drug-related issues, and that, together with my extensive networks, we could campaign even more effectively.</p> <p>In the autumn we made a breath-taking discovery: that the coalition government, in its recent curriculum review, had abandoned Labour's bill to make the PSHE (personal, social and health education) curriculum compulsory, including drug education.</p> <p>This means that every school can decide how much curriculum time it wants to devote to drug education (for more than 60% of schools that means one hour or less a year), what the curriculum is (one recent study found that 70% of pupils couldn't recall any drug education in their secondary school), and who delivers it (it might be the PE teacher, the school nurse, and often it is a police officer or an ex-user who does an assembly). Most important, schools will not be measured on whether what they teach is successful or not. Research shows that drug education, poorly taught, can increase the use of drugs.</p> <p>So we decided to team up with the <a href=\"http://www.amywinehousefoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse Foundation</a> to launch a parents' petition to lobby government to make drug education part of the national curriculum. This campaign is being launched at the House of Commons on Monday. We will demand that every child receives an approved drug education, which can be measured in terms of efficacy. There are already several programmes in use in Canada, Australia and Sweden, which have demonstrated a reduction in drugs and alcohol use of anything between 20% and 40%.</p> <p>We will also be lobbying for a separate ministry of drugs, reporting to the prime minister, as in France, where the use of hard drugs has dropped significantly since its inception, and drug deaths in 2008 were 10% of the UK total. Currently drug issues are shared out between Home Office, health and education \u2013 but are not at the top of anyone's priority list in these straitened times.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the work of Angelus goes on: we are making films with families bereaved by the loss of loved ones to drugs; of people who have been maimed, permanently or temporarily, and plan to roll them out in schools as a supplementary part of a drug education programme, and on the internet; we are researching optimum ways to communicate to young people; we are providing tips, information and scripts for parents to help them talk sensibly to their kids about drugs.</p> <p>Sadly, as with most charities, funding is a nightmare; applications to foundations and trusts take for ever to come through, but we feel we cannot stand and wait. We have to act now to try to save other families from a loss such as ours. To do so means that Louise's life \u2013 and her death \u2013 take on an extra meaning; it provides a little comfort in an otherwise darker world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Amy Winehouse Foundation \u2013 formed after the singer's death last July \u2013 is to help spearhead a new national campaign to make drug and alcohol education compulsory as part of the national curriculum, after the government dropped plans to do so. The late singer's father, Mitch, will join leaders of another young people's charity, the Angelus Foundation, to launch the initiative in the House of Commons on Monday amid rising concern over the loss of young lives from \"legal highs\", \"party drugs\" and excessive alcohol. Angelus is run by two women who both lost daughters at the age of 21 to tragic accidents involving party drugs. The Duchess of Kent, who will attend the event, is patron of the foundation. Today one of the mothers, Vicky Unwin, in an article in the Observer to mark a year since the death of her daughter, Louise, after an overdose of the controlled tranquilliser ketamine, says she was horrified to discover how plans to embed drug and alcohol education in the national curriculum had been abandoned in favour of a less prescriptive approach that means many schools now do almost none. The two organisations will launch a national petition on the Downing Street website which could force the government to grant a special debate in the Commons if it attracts 100,000 signatures. Mitch Winehouse, whose daughter died from alcohol poisoning, called on every parent to support the campaign. \"We need all the parents in this country to sign this petition to show the government that they have a duty to help the younger generation understand the dangers of drink and drugs,\" he said. The campaign will also demand the setting up of a special drugs ministry to conduct tests and assess the dangers. Angelus's founder, Maryon Stewart, whose daughter Hester lost her life after taking a mixture of alcohol and GBL, a legal high, said: \"Effective interventions, shown to reduce the use of drugs and alcohol by in excess of 50%, have been peer reviewed and published in medical journals and are currently being delivered in schools in Canada and Australia. \"To provide drug education to a child costs \u00a3500 but, according to surveys, the cost per drug-using child is in the region of \u00a31m by the time they are 30. Providing effective drugs education would save billions of pounds. I urge all parents to sign the Wise Up! petition and urge the government to put drugs education on the national curriculum so that our children can make wise and informed choices, increasing their chances of staying safe.\" A spokesman for the Department for Education said the Labour government had planned to make drug education part of the national curriculum. But a bill before the last general election in May 2010 ran out of parliamentary time. He said the current government decided that while schools would still have to conduct drug and alcohol classes as part of personal, social and health education (PSHE) it would be up to headteachers to decide how to do so \u2013 and it would not be made part of the national curriculum. Guidance as to what should be taught has recently been issued but precisely how many lessons are given and who should deliver them are discretionary. \"All pupils should have high-quality lessons to deal with the dangers of drug abuse. Schools have a legal responsibility to promote pupils' wellbeing \u2013 which should include setting out a clear drugs policy to prevent substance misuse,\" the spokesman added. \"PSHE remains a compulsory part of the curriculum (though not the national curriculum) up to 16. Teachers know their pupils best and have the power to design their own lessons and decide what is taught. We are carrying out a detailed internal review to improve PSHE teaching and will set out next steps in due course. \"We published clear advice on drugs to schools last month setting out how they can address drug misuse \u2013 including giving accurate information through the Frank campaign; working with charities and police to prevent it spreading; and providing pupils with clear information.\" Angelus maintains, however, that drug and alcohol education in many schools is inadequate. It cites surveys showing that 60% of state schools do an hour or less a year and says 70% of former state school pupils cannot recall any drugs education at all. Musician and composer James McConnel and Country Life cartoonist Annie Tempest, whose 18-year-old son, Freddy, was a heavy user of mephedrone and eventually died from a heroin overdose, will also attend Monday's event.

      "bodyText": "Turkey has called the violence in Syria \"a crime against humanity\" on the scale of the 1990s bloodshed in the Balkans, as a Red Cross convoy was once again barred from entering the Homs suburb of Baba Amr. The comment by Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu follows similar remarks from the EU on Friday, which called for the documentation of war crimes in Syria. \"No government, no authority, under no circumstances, can endorse such a total massacre of its own people,\" Davutoglu said. \"The international community must speak louder. The lack of international consensus is giving Syria the courage to continue.\" The criticism came at the end of a week in which the UK and France closed their embassies in Syria, and China and Russia appeared to shift position in calling for President Bashar al-Assad's regime to admit UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos. \"The situation in the field seems to resemble Sarajevo or Srebrenica. This seems to be the way we are heading,\" Davutoglu said at a joint news conference with Giulio Terzi, Italy's foreign minister. \"We believe that diplomatic pressure on the Assad regime must be increased. We say this not only from the point of view of the EU. We believe all international institutions must do this.\" China urged the government and the rebels to immediately end all acts of violence, especially against civilians. A foreign ministry statement urged both sides to \"launch an inclusive political dialogue with no preconditions\" under the mediation of former UN secretary- eneral Kofi Annan, the newly appointed UN-Arab League envoy on the Syria crisis, . On Friday, current UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said he had received \"grisly reports\" that Assad's troops were executing, imprisoning and torturing people in Homs. Syrian forces continued to pound the battered city and authorities handed over the bodies of two journalists killed in Baba Amr last month \u2013 including Marie Colvin of the Sunday Times \u2013 to diplomats in Damascus. Meanwhile, the wounded French journalist Edith Bouvier described for the first time how she feared her attempt to escape from Homs had ended inside a dark, three-kilometre tunnel that rebels were using to supply the besieged district of Baba Amr when the Syrian army bombarded its exit. Bouvier was abandoned, taped to a stretcher with a broken leg, as rebels and dozens of wounded headed back to the neighbourhood. \"One of them placed his Kalashnikov on me. He put his hand on my head and said a prayer. It wasn't very reassuring. Then he left,\" Bouvier told Le Figaro newspaper, for which she was working in Syria. \"I didn't know what was going to happen. Was the exit blocked? Were Syrian soldiers going to enter? I wanted to run away, before remembering that I was taped to a stretcher.\" Bouvier and French photographer William Daniels, who stayed with her, were finally rescued by a rebel who drove down the tunnel on a motorbike. Concern was mounting for civilians in freezing conditions in battered Baba Amr, where trucks from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were still blocked from entering. \"The ICRC and Syrian Red Crescent are not yet in Baba Amr today. We are still in negotiations with authorities. It is important that we enter today,\" ICRC spokesman Hicham Hassan said. Anti-government activists said they feared troops were keeping out the ICRC to prevent aid workers witnessing a massacre. UN chief Ban blamed Damascus for the fate of civilians. \"The brutal fighting has trapped civilians in their homes, without food, heat or electricity or medical care; without any chance of evacuating the wounded or burying the dead. People have been reduced to melting snow for drinking water. This atrocious assault is all the more appalling for having been waged by the government itself, systematically attacking its own people.\" Bashar Ja'afari, Syria's UN ambassador, said Ban's remarks included \"extremely virulent rhetoric which confines itself to slandering a government based on reports, opinions or hearsay\". Elsewhere in the country, Syrian state news agency Sana said a suicide car bomber in the town of Deraa, near the border with Jordan, had killed two people and wounded 20. Residents claimed seven people had been killed, and anti-Assad activists denied the attack was a suicide bombing. Rami Abdelrahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said anti-Assad fighters had earlier killed six soldiers and wounded nine in al-Herak.",

      "bodyText": "Hannah Miley confirmed her status as one of Team GB's top medal prospects in the pool for London 2012 by powering to victory in the 400m individual medley on day one at the British Gas Swimming Championships, sealing her place at London 2012 in the process. It was a remarkable seventh consecutive national title for the 22-year-old in this discipline, but with this year's competition serving simultaneously as a Team GB selection trial and the first test event using the Olympic pool at Stratford's Aquatics Centre, this one was more meaningful than most. It was also achieved in the second-fastest time of Miley's career \u2013 4min 32.67sec \u2013 and her best-ever while wearing a textile suit, as opposed to one of the hi-tech models banned by Fina from the start of 2010. \"I didn't expect that time,\" was Miley's self-effacing comment upon leaving the pool. \"I'm just relieved and happy that I was able to get the time I needed [for selection]. That was the major thing. People were like 'Oh, you've got a comfort blanket, you're so far ahead [of your rivals to make the team],' but I'm like 'Not really' \u2013 because anything can happen, especially with these young guns coming through \u2013 they can drop five or six seconds, whereas for me dropping a few-hundredths is the target.\" Asked whether such a time suggested she could now be on course for gold at London 2012, Miley was circumspect. \"Could be. But sometimes it's not down to times, it's down to the ability to race whoever is around you. Whoever wins gold at London might not be much quicker than that \u2013 they could be slower \u2013 but it's having that ability to just see people around you and give it all you've got and race them.\" What will help Miley, on this evidence, is the presence of an enthusiastic home crowd. The 2,500 fans at the Aquatics Centre on Saturday night may have been divided by their preference for individual British athletes, but all rallied behind Miley as she moved to the front just after the quarter-way mark of her race and began to dominate the field. \"You can certainly hear them on breaststroke, it's awesome,\" she said when asked if she had been aware of the crowd. \"Even walking out, I had my music on full blast, I thought 'Stay focused, stay focused', but \u2026 it's not so much the sound but you can just feel it right deep inside you. And that's something with two and a half thousand, so when the whole stadium's going to be full that's going be incredible.\" Perhaps the only competitor better supported than Miley was Roberto Pavoni, who secured his own place at the Games by winning the men's final in the same discipline. His Italian father, Mauro, was hard to miss as he bounded enthusiastically up and down in the aisle of one of the stands alongside the pool, screaming \"Vai Robby!\" (go Robby!). \"I didn't hear him, I have to try to block him out,\" joked Pavoni, who won his final in a personal best time of 4min 12.43sec \u2013 the fastest recorded anywhere in the world this year. \"I have to say while I'm here a big thanks to my dad. He's been there every step of the way.\" Miley \u2013 a European and Commonwealth champion in 2010 \u2013 and Pavoni \u2013 who made his first world championship final last year \u2013 will be joined in Team GB's squad for the Games by Aimee Willmott and Joseph Roebuck, who finished second in their respective races while also posting times within the stipulated qualifying boundaries, as well as Robert Renwick, who won the men's 400m freestyle. Keri-Anne Payne became the first swimmer to qualify for Team GB when she won the 10km open water swim event at last year's world championships. She is targeting a place in various indoor events as well, but missed out on the first of those when finishing only fifth in the 400m individual medley \u2013 more than 12 seconds behind Miley. For many spectators, though, the real thrill was getting to see this venue in action. Certainly that was true for the Locog chairman, Lord Coe. \"I can't really divorce what I've seen here from what I was trying to sell eight years ago to the IOC,\" he said. \"I was basically standing in a tower block about half a mile from here and trying to explain to the IOC that 'You see where that 50ft mountain of rotting fridges is? We're going to put an aquatics centre there.' I felt like a slightly dodgy Spanish timeshare salesman.\" \"So it's not really having got it to this point \u2014 it's having removed 80,000 tonnes of contaminated soil and replaced it with 120,000 tonnes of clean soil, having dealt with the archaeological find of three skeletons under the site and to have created something that is really what we consider to be the gateway to the park.\" He was keen to emphasis the legacy impact, too, of the Zaha Hadid-designed venue, the stylish interior of which will be matched by an equally impressive exterior once the two temporary wings of Olympic seating have been removed.",

      "body": "<p>Hannah Miley confirmed her status as one of Team GB's top medal prospects in the pool for London 2012 by powering to victory in the 400m individual medley on day one at the British Gas Swimming Championships, sealing her place at London 2012 in the process.</p> <p>It was a remarkable seventh consecutive national title for the 22-year-old in this discipline, but with this year's competition serving simultaneously as a Team GB selection trial and the first test event using the Olympic pool at Stratford's Aquatics Centre, this one was more meaningful than most. It was also achieved in the second-fastest time of Miley's career \u2013 4min 32.67sec \u2013 and her best-ever while wearing a textile suit, as opposed to one of the hi-tech models banned by Fina from the start of 2010.</p> <p>\"I didn't expect that time,\" was Miley's self-effacing comment upon leaving the pool. \"I'm just relieved and happy that I was able to get the time I needed [for selection]. That was the major thing. People were like 'Oh, you've got a comfort blanket, you're so far ahead [of your rivals to make the team],' but I'm like 'Not really' \u2013 because anything can happen, especially with these young guns coming through \u2013 they can drop five or six seconds, whereas for me dropping a few-hundredths is the target.\"</p> <p>Asked whether such a time suggested she could now be on course for gold at London 2012, Miley was circumspect. \"Could be. But sometimes it's not down to times, it's down to the ability to race whoever is around you. Whoever wins gold at London might not be much quicker than that \u2013 they could be slower \u2013 but it's having that ability to just see people around you and give it all you've got and race them.\"</p> <p>What will help Miley, on this evidence, is the presence of an enthusiastic home crowd. The 2,500 fans at the Aquatics Centre on Saturday night may have been divided by their preference for individual British athletes, but all rallied behind Miley as she moved to the front just after the quarter-way mark of her race and began to dominate the field.</p> <p>\"You can certainly hear them on breaststroke, it's awesome,\" she said when asked if she had been aware of the crowd. \"Even walking out, I had my music on full blast, I thought 'Stay focused, stay focused', but \u2026 it's not so much the sound but you can just feel it right deep inside you.

      "bodyText": "Fraizer Campbell has been playing professional football long enough to have heard countless public address messages in which \"Mr X\" is urged to make an immediate dash for the nearest labour ward. Usually they result in a nervous-looking father heading hastily towards the turnstiles but occasionally a stubborn lack of movement suggests that the man in question might be turning a deaf ear and waiting for the final whistle. The Sunderland striker faced a broadly similar dilemma on Wednesday morning. Campbell was woken at 6am in England's team hotel in Hertfordshire by his north-east based girlfriend, Emma, with the news that she had gone into labour with their first child, five days early. \"At first I couldn't understand why she was waking me at that time on a match day,\" he says. \"Then she said she thought it was about to happen. I spent the rest of the day sitting in my hotel room having conversations on the phone with Emma, my dad and the doctor, wondering what to do. \"I called Stuart Pearce [England's caretaker manager] and he told me to do what I felt I needed to. I didn't want to miss the birth but I didn't want to go back and then the baby not come until the next day. I also had about 35 relatives and friends who had hired a bus to come to Wembley so I owed it to them to hang around too!\" The initial indications were that Emma could be in for a long labour so a plan was formed whereby a driver stationed outside Wembley would transport Campbell to a private jet immediately after the match. Meanwhile another chauffeur waited for the flight at Newcastle airport before whisking the former Manchester United forward to Emma's bedside. In the event Isla Rose was not prepared to wait around for the England debutant's return. She instead emerged into the world at almost precisely the same time as her father was introduced as a second-half substitute, thereby winning his first senior cap. \"Isla Rose came at about 9.50pm which was just about exactly the time I was coming on,\" says Campbell. \"I was a bit gutted to miss the birth and I was in a daze after the game. I had this massive headache all the way back up here. I was so stressed. I just couldn't get there quick enough.\" Late he may have been but Campbell is determined to be a 21st century father. \"I've already changed a few nappies,\" he says. \"But I haven't lost too much sleep.\" Even so, Sunderland fans desperate for their team to avenge a series of disappointing results against Newcastle will be relieved to learn that Martin O'Neill's side spent Saturday night in a hotel ahead of Sunday's derby at St James' Park. \"It's a big game,\" said Campbell, who was sidelined by serious knee trouble for both August's 1-0 defeat to Alan Pardew's side at the Stadium of Light and last season's 5-1 humiliation on Tyneside. \"I watched the 5-1 defeat sitting at my mum's house and I nearly put her plasma television through the window.\" With Sunderland in generally vibrant form since O'Neill succeeded Steve Bruce in December, Wearside hopes are considerably higher this weekend but England's latest international is simply happy to be involved. Before stepping off the bench to score a vital equaliser during an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Middlesbrough in January, the 24-year-old had been out of the game for 18 months during which time he underwent two cruciate ligament repairs on the same knee. After appearing to recover from the original injury, sustained in August 2010, he was warming up ahead of his intended comeback game against Manchester City the following April when he felt the knee go again. Another operation and a long, boring, anxiety-filled rehabilitation beckoned. \"The medics told me there was only a 5% chance of it happening a second time and I was just unlucky,\" says the usually relentlessly, impressively cheerful Campbell. \"But it's hard to describe the low point when I did my knee again. It was back to square one and it takes longer the second time. I've been through every emotion. The second one was really upsetting because you don't know if it's going to keep happening.\" For several weeks the idea of walking down a flight of stairs normally seemed a miraculous prospect, as did driving a car. The act of actually kneeling down took considerably longer. \"In the early stages you can hardly bend your leg at all,\" Campbell says. \"You're just sitting around with a machine on it. \"Later on, the hardest part is coming to the club each morning and the other lads are going out training while you're going to the gym and thinking: 'I hate this bike.' You don't know if you're going to be the same player again. \"I'll always be there for Isla Rose but one of the reasons I stayed down there on Wednesday was because the thought that I could get injured again and never have the chance to play for England was preying on my mind.\" Only passing time, games and goals will begin erasing such, very human, fears but it is impossible to overestimate the immediate psychological boost offered by Pearce's summons. \"The England call-up was a bit of a payback for my family because it's been a tough 18 months for them too,\" reflects a striker variously loaned to Royal Antwerp, Hull City (where he learned a lot playing alongside Nick Barmby) and Tottenham Hotspur by Sir Alex Ferguson before joining Sunderland in 2009. Almost three years on he harbours outside hopes of making England's Euro 2012 squad. \"I've had a little taste of it and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to be part of that,\" says Campbell. \"If I keep doing my stuff, hopefully I've got a chance.\"",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has vowed to press on with controversial health reforms, insisting he will continue to champion radical and sometimes unpopular policies after the departure of his right-hand man, Steve Hilton. However, in a sign of irritation with Andrew Lansley's failure to make the case for change in the NHS, the prime minister pointedly neglected to mention the health secretary by name in an address to party supporters. Cameron told the Tory spring conference in London that his party would not be able to deliver a better and fairer country by ducking tough choices \u2013 such as those on welfare, the future of the NHS reform and the deficit. \"We won't get there by playing safe,\" he said. \"To be strong and fair we've got to be tough and bold.\" On the NHS, the prime minister said he wanted Conservatives to feel \"proud\" of the \"tough decisions\" to put GPs in charge of commissioning services and open the health service up to more private sector involvement. \"I know it has been a difficult journey,\" he said. \"We're not reforming the NHS because it's easy. Let alone popular. We're doing it because it is right and necessary. In fact, it is more than that. It is unavoidable and it is urgent.\" He said he was prepared to \"take a hit\" in terms of popularity for the sake of health reforms that were right. But while Cameron went out of his way to single out the education secretary, Michael Gove, for praise for his drive to improve education, he declined to name-check Lansley in a clear sign the health secretary is losing favour. It is now widely expected that Lansley will be removed from his post in a reshuffle after the summer holidays. Amid the furore over the reforms, No 10 has decided to take closer control over health policy, including the future of social care for the elderly, which will be the subject of a much delayed white paper in the spring or early summer. Cameron was speaking the day after his friend and closest aide, Steve Hilton, announced he was quitting Downing Street to take a year's unpaid leave, joining his family in California. Hilton's move has caused unease in Tory circles, with many MPs voicing private concerns that Cameron has lost his most radical voice inside No 10, and will be more prone to compromise with the Liberal Democrats. The prime minister said it was right to go ahead with plans for a high-speed rail link between London and the north that will carve up key Tory heartlands \u2013 a comment that prompted dissent from the audience. On Monday, Labour will put pressure on Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, to reconsider reforms to tax credits and child benefits ahead of the budget on 21 March. Labour says the government should cancel changes coming into force in April that will see up to 200,000 working parents lose almost \u00a34,000 a year in working tax credits. Labour is also calling for the government to review proposed changes to child benefit which would mean that a family with two earners each bringing in \u00a342,000, a total of \u00a384,000, would keep all their child benefit, while a single-earner family on \u00a343,000 would lose it. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, will say during an opposition day debate that dumping the reforms could be funded by closing a stamp duty loophole on properties over \u00a31m which is costing the Treasury hundreds of millions of pounds.",

Hilton's move has caused unease in Tory circles, with many MPs voicing private concerns that Cameron has lost his most radical voice inside No&#xa0;10, and will be more prone to compromise with the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>The prime minister said it was right to go ahead with plans for a high-speed rail link between London and the north that will carve up key Tory heartlands \u2013 a comment that prompted dissent from the audience.</p> <p>On Monday, Labour will put pressure on Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, to reconsider reforms to tax credits and child benefits ahead of the budget on 21&#xa0;March.</p> <p>Labour says the government should cancel changes coming into force in April that will see up to 200,000 working parents lose almost \u00a34,000 a year in working tax credits. Labour is also calling for the government to review proposed changes to child benefit which would mean that a family with two earners each bringing in \u00a342,000, a total of \u00a384,000, would keep all their child benefit, while a single-earner family on \u00a343,000 would lose it.</p> <p>Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, will say during an opposition day debate that dumping the reforms could be funded by closing a stamp duty loophole on properties over \u00a31m which is costing the Treasury hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The police or security services supplied information to a blacklist funded by the country's major construction firms that has kept thousands of people out of work over the past three decades. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has revealed that records that could only have come from the police or MI5 have been discovered in a vast database of files held on 3,200 victims who were deemed leftwing or troublesome. The files were collected by the Consulting Association, a clandestine organisation funded by major names in the construction industry. Its database was seized nearly three years ago, but the extraordinary nature of the information held has only now emerged, following an employment tribunal for one of the victims, Dave Smith, a 46-year-old engineer who had a 36-page file against his name and was victimised repeatedly for highlighting safety hazards on sites, including the presence of asbestos. David Clancy, investigations manager at the ICO, told the central London tribunal adjudicating on Smith's claims against construction giant Carillion that \"there is information on the Consulting Association files that I believe could only be supplied by the police or the security services\". Speaking to the Observer, Clancy added: \"The information was so specific and it contained in effect operational information that wouldn't have formed anything other than a police record.\" The scandal will be thrown open to further public exposure in the coming months as a class action by 100 victims against at least 39 companies is set to be pursued in the high court by Hugh Tomlinson QC, currently counsel for several of the phone-hacking claimants. The revelations will inevitably raise fresh questions about the probity of the police in a week in which its relationship with major news corporations, and News International in particular, has come under sharp focus. Last week the Leveson inquiry heard that the police were investigating a \"network of corrupt officials\" as part of their inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption. Clancy said he was unable further to trace the specific sources of the information held in the Consulting Association files because it touched on individuals living across the country and stretched over three decades. He added that the relationship between the Consulting Association and the police and security services appeared to have been nurtured when the organisation went under an earlier guise as the Economic League, at a time when the state was keen to liaise with major building firms to discover as much as it could about Irish construction workers amid the threat of IRA terrorism. John McDonnell MP, who first raised the issue of blacklisting a decade ago, said he would demand a debate in parliament on what he described as collusion. \"I am outraged at the systematic abuse of people's rights. This has destroyed people's lives, broken up families, ensured that people have not been able to earn a living. It has devastated people year after year, and nobody has listened to us. No one has been willing to believe the extent to which there has been collusion between police, security services and companies. It is all about the ability of companies to exploit workers and destroy anybody who stands up against them.\" The existence of the secret blacklist was first exposed in 2009, when ICO investigators from the Information Commissioner's Office raided an unassuming office in Droitwich, Worcestershire. The investigators uncovered an extensive database that was used by construction firms to vet workers they deemed to be trade unionists and troublesome \u2013 usually trade unionists. More than 40 construction firms, including Balfour Beatty and Sir Robert McAlpine, had been funding the confidential database, which recorded workers' trade union activities and conduct at work. The Consulting Association was closed down and a 66-year-old private investigator, Ian Kerr, was fined \u00a35,000 for administering the database, although the construction firms escaped prosecution. At Smith's tribunal, Carillion admitted that two of its subsidiaries covertly supplied information to the database to \"penalise\" Smith for being a trade unionist, even though he had \"reasonably brought health and safety concerns to their attention\". However, Smith lost his claim for \u00a3175,000 in lost income because he worked through an agency and was not directly employed by Carillion. A spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it had not yet received a complaint from the victims or the ICO.",

      "bodyText": "Passengers from the Costa Concordia shared tales of their trauma at a preliminary hearing into the causes of the cruise ship disaster as damning new details about its captain emerged. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest after steering the ship on to rocks on the island of Giglio on 13 January, was not wearing his glasses that night, the ship's first officer has told investigators. \"He had forgotten them,\" said Ciro Ambrosio. \"He asked me a number of times to adjust the scale of the radar because he couldn't see it well.\" As Schettino grounded the listing ship in shallow water and it took on water, he told officers to lie to coastguards. \"He ordered us to say everything was under control,\" said Ambrosio. Investigators have also learned that Mario Palombo, a former officer at cruise ship operator Costa Cruises, who mentored Schettino, warned in 2003 that Schettino's pride drove him to lie. \"In many cases, he preferred to lie to me rather than admit mistakes,\" Palombo wrote at the time. Twenty-five passengers who have registered with the court as injured parties joined more than 100 lawyers and forensic experts in a theatre in the Tuscan town of Grosseto, booked to handle the crowd at the pre-trial hearing. \"I just had to be here, I have to know how it happened,\" said Patrizia Perilli, who has been seeing a therapist since she fled the ship with 200 passengers in a lifeboat that crashed repeatedly against the tilting hull as it dropped into the sea. As other passengers threaded past police barricades, curious onlookers and hordes of cameramen, they told similar stories of loss of sleep, panic attacks and visits to therapists and asked the same question \u2013 how did a ship the size of a tower block end up on its side, killing 32 passengers and crew. \"I made it out, but now I want justice for the dead,\" said office worker Patrizia Bagnasco, 55. Giacomo Brignone, a pizza restaurant owner from the island of Lampedusa, arrived with his wife and nine-year-old daughter Lina, who said: \"I remember people praying, no one knowing what to do, and the cold.\" The hearing was procedural, covering the appointment of experts to analyse the ship's black box. \"I have dealt with cases involving more deaths, but what happened here defies belief,\" said one British lawyer there, Clive Garner. Italian lawyer Pietro Ilardi said that Irina Navarova, a 25-year-old Russian ship's entertainer, sustained serious facial injuries when she fell from a deck, tumbled down the tilted ship's hull and swam to shore. \"She is scarred for life and the firm offered her just \u20ac3,000 [\u00a32,500] in compensation because she was not in the union,\" said Ilardi. \"Schettino was an imbecile, a criminal,\" said Francesca Scarramuzzi, 65, a retired teacher who was on board. \"But I'd like to know if the company delayed abandoning ship in order to try to make it into port to avoid the compensation triggered by using lifeboats.\" A lawyer representing Costa Cruises denied the firm had told Schettino not to abandon ship, despite 17 calls between the captain and company official Roberto Ferrarini in the hour after the collision. \"That is impossible,\" said Alessandro Carella. \"Schettino was the only one able to make the decision to abandon ship by law and company policy.\" Apart from Schettino, eight other ship's officers and Costa executives are under investigation, including Ferrarini, who joined the emergency team set up by the firm last week to assist the more than 1,000 passengers and crew on another company vessel, the Costa Allegra, which was towed into the Seychelles after a fire knocked out all power on board.",

Only the Sheffield middleweight Herol Graham of the modern era could challenge his right to that accolade. How close the Dartford lightweight came, though, in 1961 when, according to most at ringside, he was robbed over 15 pulsating rounds in a rematch at Earls Court in London with the fine American world champion, Joe \"Old Bones\" Brown. The Ring magazine made it their Fight of the Year, an award of considerable worth given the competition, not to mention Brown's pedigree. Brown beat Charnley on cuts the first time they met, in Texas two years earlier; when they rounded out their rivalry in 1963, the Kent fighter knocked out Brown in the sixth of 10 scheduled rounds at the King's Hall, Belle Vue, in Manchester. Dave was just 27, and Joe's bones were nearly nine years older, but it was a superb win against a fighter who had successfully defended the world lightweight title 11 times, more than anyone in his division until the arrival of Roberto Duran. In the days before multiple governing bodies, Charnley never got another world title shot; today he might have had several. He retired in 1964 after ill-advisedly going up in weight to fight the world welterweight champion, Emile Griffith, in a non-title 10-rounder at the Empire Pool, Wembley, another long-gone venue. Griffith stopped him in the ninth but, in one of his last interviews, with Steve Bunce for the BBC last September, Charnley allowed himself a rare word of praise: \"I was quite good up to the ninth.\" Listening to that tape is like going back in time to an age of good manners and self-deprecation, of respect and honour in the ring. Charnley \u2013 who was on a brief book tour to advertise his biography, The Dartford Destroyer, written by James Kirkwood, remembered his first sensation in the sport as that of \"excitement\". He spoke quietly with a polite, unassuming air, grateful for the opportunity to reminisce. \"It was terrible,\" he said of the second Jones fight, \"but there we are. If I'd got the decision and I thought I'd lost, I wouldn't have been appreciative really.\" He won British, Commonwealth and European titles, and finished with 48 wins (27 stoppages), 12 defeats and a draw in the 10 years from 1954. He had won the ABA featherweight title and boxed for the Fitzroy Lodge club in south London. Those are just the stats. The wonder of Charnley was his poise. Light on his feet, he advanced on his opponents from a southpaw stance like a tiger closing on his prey. He had a wicked left, thrown hard and straight. Charnley later had hairdressing salons and dabbled in property. \"By the time it turns around, I might be too old to do it,\" he said of the recession that undermined his businesses. \"I didn't particularly like watching too much boxing,\" he said. \"I lived in Dartford, at least an hour's travel to the arenas. I watch it now and again on TV.\" You just hope he was not watching two weekends ago when David Haye and Dereck Chisora disgraced themselves in Munich, because that was about as far from the sport he knew and respected as it is possible to imagine. YOUR CALL To York Hall in Bethnal Green for Radio 5 Live's attempt to put context on the events of the past week or so. It was a worthwhile exercise, although spoiled in parts by the ingrained habit of boxing folk to row rather than listen. The promoters Frank Warren and Eddie Hearn were there, and even agreed now and again. So were my loud old mate, Buncey, the BBC's excellent boxing correspondent Mike Costello, Colin Hart (whose silver locks only add to his eminence grise), Kevin Mitchell, who looked fit and expects to get a crack at Ricky Burns if the Scot wins his world title fight against Paulus Moses in Glasgow on Saturday night, former champ James Cook, who does a lot of great community work, Jane Crouch, MBE, and still combative, as well as a decent gathering of fans. I was slightly surprised to find myself agreeing most to the calm reason of a Tory, the member for Bristol North West, Charlotte Leslie, who is not only a huge Bob Dylan fan but has surfed, swum to a good level, boxed (not competitively) and probably appreciated the bearpit atmosphere, which occasionally had all the couth of prime minister's question time. Leslie is also president of the National Smelting Co (NSC) Amateur Boxing Club in Shirehampton, Bristol, and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on boxing. Boxing needs all the friends it can get, and the kids at her club have a hard-working advocate for the good side of boxing. As for Haye and Chisora, the debate followed predictable lines. Warren provided interesting insight to shenanigans by Wladimir Klitschko in the Chisora dressing room before his fight with Vitali Klitschko. Is that any excuse for the way he behaved afterwards, though? Not really. Dereck has said sorry, but he has yet to pay the price. Neither fighter held their nerve under pressure. In a couple of crazy minutes they forgot everything they might have been taught about self-control. It is impossible to imagine Dave Charnley ever being involved in such an unsavoury incident. Indeed, with a couple of exceptions, these public brawls are a phenomenon of the past 20 years or so. When Chisora goes before the British Boxing Board of Control on 14 March, it is a thought the panel ought to keep in mind. Most of them knew Charnley.",

      "bodyText": "Dear Tom The rise of the internet, from obscurity to ubiquity in the course of a few decades, has had profound effects on our society and on us as individuals. No one could have predicted how significant it would become, and no one can predict with any certainty how it will develop. This is true of the underlying technologies, but it is equally and, arguably more importantly, true of the changes that the internet has on how we communicate and interact with each other. It has brought us an overwhelming range of benefits, providing a universal tool to communicate, to organise our lives and to access entertainment. What concerns me most is that this tool brings with it risks that we simply haven't grasped. Social networks encourage us to share every aspect of our lives with our friends, but, by providing that service, those networks see everything that we share, and use that information to categorise, profile and predict us. These services aren't \"free\" \u2013 we pay for them with our personal data, and the profits are huge. It could be argued, and often is by the heads of large technology companies, that privacy is dead and that the benefits of social networks and similar services easily outweigh the perceived loss of privacy. I would argue that we do not yet fully understand the power of the data we have shared, and that by unwittingly giving this information to Google, Facebook and others we are shaping the future of our society in ways we cannot predict. For the entirety of human history, we have operated on small scales and in relative anonymity. Our words are heard by the few people close to us and most are quickly forgotten. We walk down the street without passers-by knowing our names or history. The internet has started to change that. Our words and actions can easily be shared with billions of people around the globe and archived indefinitely. The details of our lives can be found simply by typing our name into Google. We need to understand the risks of this type of technology so that we can fully gain its benefits. We need protections, both technical and legal, so that a small mistake cannot devastate our lives. We also need education to help us function in a world where privacy is no longer the natural state of being. Dear Joss I think you've hit the nail on the head when you write that, by sharing data, we are shaping the future of our society in ways that cannot be predicted. How, then, can we mitigate against the worst consequences of trends we can scarcely envisage? If recent economic history suggests anything, it's that humans are poor at risk assessment. Can we hope to comprehend these risks until at least some of us have experienced them in their worst form? Quite possibly not \u2013 not least because of the intuition- defying divide between the daily delights of social networking and its potential repercussions in the form of snooping, stalking, identity theft, state surveillance and much else besides. While it's difficult to disagree with your call for education and effective protections, I find myself worrying about another set of unintended consequences behind this warning: that we risk polarising a vital debate into paralysis, rather than facing up to the knotty human issues feeding it. I'm not sure how helpful it is, for example, to lump the perspectives of most large technology companies together under the banner \"privacy is dead\". Clearly, there's a lot of money being made today \u2013 and much of it with breathtaking cynicism \u2013 by extracting as much personal information as possible from the eager and the unwitting, as well as from the eager and well-informed. Facebook's initial public offering is barely the beginning and it will be both alarming and fascinating to see how its heft continues to grow. It's also increasingly clear, however, that granting and respecting privacy of various kinds is becoming a vital part of most business strategies reliant on users' goodwill, attention and effort \u2013 for all its faults, Google placed particular emphasis on this in creating Google+ \u2013 and that many of the most worrying trends taking place across the digital world are born more from corporate ignorance than malice. This doesn't excuse ignorance or cynicism. But I do worry that much of the \"us\" and \"them\" attitude directed towards tech companies may be hitting the wrong targets, and that privacy itself risks becoming a bugbear rather than a rallying call. Those perpetrating both present and potential crimes and abuses \u2013 whether they're members of a corporation, the criminal underworld, or a national government \u2013 must be stopped, and the techniques they deploy identified and disabled. But the \"we\" who are truly in this together encompasses most of the companies it's tempting to vilify and the elected officials it's easy to pillory as ignorant. Without them, there will be no such thing as real progress. Dear Tom The balance between privacy and innovation is crucial to this debate and I wouldn't want to suggest we treat privacy as anything more than one among several fundamental human rights. As you've noted, the pleasures of social networking are real and tangible whereas the privacy risks tend to seem far away. From a corporate perspective the profits are equally real, and the risks of privacy violations remain as far away. I think that this is why we are seeing, for example with Google's Street View as well as its recent privacy policy changes, a tactic of asking forgiveness rather than permission. I very much agree that treating companies, and indeed our governments, as closed entities that we must fight every inch of the way is not productive. It is certainly worth praising Google for the wide promotion of its new privacy policy, even while we can criticise the policy itself. Engagement, and Google is particularly active in engaging researchers and activists, is vital. The risks, however, aren't entirely unknown. Examples of people who have had sensitive information revealed about, for example, their sexuality are the more familiar stories. We should also be concerned about our profiles becoming the conflated with our \"real\" identity: Google already presents us with search results that it believes we want and so hides from us views or opinions with which we may disagree. Without being overly alarmist, this raises fundamental issues concerning our individuality, personal development and autonomy; not in the least through our ability to present the face we wish to present in different social contexts. Can we mitigate these risks without seeing them? I think we can try. If we drive a car with our eyes shut and foot flat on the accelerator then we will not see the wall before we hit it; we need to open our eyes, and I would also like a hand on the steering wheel \u2013 and preferably not one that's invisible. Dear Joss The distinction you draw between asking for forgiveness and seeking permission seems a very useful one \u2013 and reminds me of that all-too-familiar political rigmarole of the disgraced official's public \"apology\", where ostentatious contrition is somehow supposed to substitute for facing consequences or making amends. What, then, are the best mechanisms for making real consequences and amends possible in the areas we're talking about? I'm sure we agree that driving flat out with both eyes shut isn't a recipe for progress. But I remain less sure whose hands should be grasping the steering wheel and who gets to apply the brakes. This is especially true when it comes to those overlapping issues you identify: our ability to present ourselves to the world in ways we control and to control how the world is presented to us in turn. In each case I'm reminded of a phrase that American legal scholar Cass Sunstein used in his 2009 book On Rumours. He argued that the dissemination of false or harmful materials via open technologies should be counterbalanced by a legal \"chilling effect\", making it easier to issue takedown notices and hold service operators responsible for content. Versions of this question have cropped up again and again, from the Stop Online Piracy Act to the net neutrality debate. And what interests me more than the rights or wrongs of such proposals (although I think we'd largely agree about these) is the massive, intractable scale of the impasse they seem to be circling. Those with most to hide \u2013 from brave revolutionaries to sinister government cronies \u2013 are, I think, already well aware that true privacy means having no digital records at all. For the rest of us, though, the question is whether preserving the unprecedented openness of a decentralised global network is compatible with putting truly effective mechanisms in place for chilling its excesses. This may well be unanswerable. But in a sense we already face a miniature version of this question every day in the services we choose to use, and what we entrust them with. Should we be flocking towards the tidy, secure walled gardens of media ecosystems like Apple's \u2013 or running as fast as we can in the opposite direction? Dear Tom I believe that the fewer enforced restrictions on individual expression the better; that the true triumph of the internet is as an open platform for endless creativity. My hope is for means to limit the harm to individuals that comes from exploiting the inherent inspectability that the internet brings. I'm aware of the apparent paradox here: I'm asking for the internet to be open and free for individuals, but restricted for corporations. Let me instead argue that those who by offering us services place themselves in a position of power over us be required to exercise it with responsibility. Chilling effects are, of course, a powerful tool, the results of which we experience every day. Unfortunately, this form of legal approach massively favours large corporations that have the resources to wage endless legal battles and, in practice, often use it to \"chill\" creativity and freedom of expression. (I would advise anyone to look into chillingeffects.org, which documents the phenomenon.) I don't have a simple answer, and I don't believe that one exists; we need to find a subtle balance of technology, law, consumer pressure and individual education; and we need it at a global level. We need to act beforehand, because we can't take back data once it is released. We will get things wrong, of course, but we need to take a holistic and long-term look at how we can affect the technologies that, in turn, affect us. We would do well to look at the development of the environmental movement, which has laid the groundwork for this kind of debate. We need to consider proactive means to protect the information environment that we have created from long-term externalities that are not immediately apparent. As to the services that we choose to use, walled gardens are initially convenient and comfortable; what terrifies me is the extent to which they lead us to stop thinking beyond the walls, and to conform to the safe options that they present. I prefer the freedom and complexity of open services, without walls or gates, that do not ask who I am and do not ask me to stay the same. Dear Joss Thank you for your considered response \u2013 and for your neat articulation of the tension between individual freedom and corporate responsibility. Another way of putting this, perhaps, is that in the internet we possess an unprecedentedly democratic set of tools which also gifts unprecedented power to those controlling its infrastructure. There is, for me, more thus far to celebrate than there is to mourn in the changes these tools have brought. But you're surely right to highlight the difficulty of acting in advance across many interlocked fields to safeguard against as-yet-indeterminate perils. Your example of the environmental movement laying the groundwork for this debate also seems almost too apt, in that it suggests how little effective action tends collectively to be taken by humanity when a problem \u2013 however menacing \u2013 is nebulous. As a writer, I'd like nothing better than for eloquent explanations and expert insights to create an entirely persuasive movement anatomising technology's opportunities and perils. I can't help feeling, though, that words will never be enough; and that the most necessary counterpoint to the resources corporations and governments possess remains that one field where weight of numbers truly counts, direct action. Here, from Occupy and UK Uncut to the Arab spring, the present is richly stocked with role models and warnings: with devolved, ideologically charged movements embodying many of those virtues you set out. There's surely hope in this notion of privacy defended by avowedly public action \u2013 and safeguarded by those open, evolving digital services you advocate. But only if those protesting are ultimately able to find common cause with those wielding other forms of power. \u25a0 Joss Wright is a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, Oxford University, studying anonymous communications, privacy-enhancing technologies and online censorship. \u25a0 Tom Chatfield is a writer and commentator on digital culture.

But I do worry that much of the \"us\" and \"them\" attitude directed towards tech companies may be hitting the wrong targets, and that privacy itself risks becoming a bugbear rather than a rallying call.</p> <p>Those perpetrating both present and potential crimes and abuses \u2013 whether they're members of a corporation, the criminal underworld, or a national government \u2013 must be stopped, and the techniques they deploy identified and disabled. But the \"we\" who are truly in this together encompasses most of the companies it's tempting to vilify and the elected officials it's easy to pillory as ignorant. Without them, there will be no such thing as real progress.</p> <p><strong>Dear Tom</strong></p> <p>The balance between privacy and innovation is crucial to this debate and I wouldn't want to suggest we treat privacy as anything more than one among several fundamental human rights.</p> <p>As you've noted, the pleasures of social networking are real and tangible whereas the privacy risks tend to seem far away. From a corporate perspective the profits are equally real, and the risks of privacy violations remain as far away. I think that this is why we are seeing, for example with Google's Street View as well as its recent privacy policy changes, a tactic of asking forgiveness rather than permission.</p> <p>I very much agree that treating companies, and indeed our governments, as closed entities that we must fight every inch of the way is not productive. It is certainly worth praising Google for the wide promotion of its new privacy policy, even while we can criticise the policy itself. Engagement, and Google is particularly active in engaging researchers and activists, is vital.</p> <p>The risks, however, aren't entirely unknown. Examples of people who have had sensitive information revealed about, for example, their sexuality are the more familiar stories. We should also be concerned about our profiles becoming the conflated with our \"real\" identity: Google already presents us with search results that it believes we want and so hides from us views or opinions with which we may disagree. Without being overly alarmist, this raises fundamental issues concerning our individuality, personal development and autonomy; not in the least through our ability to present the face we wish to present in different social contexts.</p> <p>Can we mitigate these risks without seeing them? I think we can try. If we drive a car with our eyes shut and foot flat on the accelerator then we will not see the wall before we hit it; we need to open our eyes, and I would also like a hand on the steering wheel \u2013 and preferably not one that's invisible.</p> <p><strong>Dear Joss</strong></p> <p>The distinction you draw between asking for forgiveness and seeking permission seems a very useful one \u2013 and reminds me of that all-too-familiar political rigmarole of the disgraced official's public \"apology\", where ostentatious contrition is somehow supposed to substitute for facing consequences or making amends.</p> <p>What, then, are the best mechanisms for making real consequences and amends possible in the areas we're talking about?</p> <p>I'm sure we agree that driving flat out with both eyes shut isn't a recipe for progress. But I remain less sure whose hands should be grasping the steering wheel and who gets to apply the brakes. This is especially true when it comes to those overlapping issues you identify: our ability to present ourselves to the world in ways we control and to control how the world is presented to us in turn.</p> <p>In each case I'm reminded of a phrase that American legal scholar Cass Sunstein used in his 2009 book <em>On Rumours</em>. He argued that the dissemination of false or harmful materials via open technologies should be counterbalanced by a legal \"chilling effect\", making it easier to issue takedown notices and hold service operators responsible for content.</p> <p>Versions of this question have cropped up again and again, from the Stop Online Piracy Act to the net neutrality debate. And what interests me more than the rights or wrongs of such proposals (although I think we'd largely agree about these) is the massive, intractable scale of the impasse they seem to be circling.</p> <p>Those with most to hide \u2013 from brave revolutionaries to sinister government cronies \u2013 are, I think, already well aware that true privacy means having no digital records at all. For the rest of us, though, the question is whether preserving the unprecedented openness of a decentralised global network is compatible with putting truly effective mechanisms in place for chilling its excesses.</p> <p>This may well be unanswerable. But in a sense we already face a miniature version of this question every day in the services we choose to use, and what we entrust them with. Should we be flocking towards the tidy, secure walled gardens of media ecosystems like Apple's \u2013 or running as fast as we can in the opposite direction?</p> <p><strong>Dear Tom</strong></p> <p>I believe that the fewer enforced restrictions on individual expression the better; that the true triumph of the internet is as an open platform for endless creativity. My hope is for means to limit the harm to individuals that comes from exploiting the inherent inspectability that the internet brings.</p> <p>I'm aware of the apparent paradox here: I'm asking for the internet to be open and free for individuals, but restricted for corporations. Let me instead argue that those who by offering us services place themselves in a position of power over us be required to exercise it with responsibility.</p> <p>Chilling effects are, of course, a powerful tool, the results of which we experience every day. Unfortunately, this form of legal approach massively favours large corporations that have the resources to wage endless legal battles and, in practice, often use it to \"chill\" creativity and freedom of expression. (I would advise anyone to look into chillingeffects.org, which documents the phenomenon.)</p> <p>I don't have a simple answer, and I don't believe that one exists; we need to find a subtle balance of technology, law, consumer pressure and individual education; and we need it at a global level. We need to act beforehand, because we can't take back data once it is released. We will get things wrong, of course, but we need to take a holistic and long-term look at how we can affect the technologies that, in turn, affect us. We would do well to look at the development of the environmental movement, which has laid the groundwork for this kind of debate. We need to consider proactive means to protect the information environment that we have created from long-term externalities that are not immediately apparent.</p> <p>As to the services that we choose to use, walled gardens are initially convenient and comfortable; what terrifies me is the extent to which they lead us to stop thinking beyond the walls, and to conform to the safe options that they present. I prefer the freedom and complexity of open services, without walls or gates, that do not ask who I am and do not ask me to stay the same.</p> <p><strong>Dear Joss</strong></p> <p>Thank you for your considered response \u2013 and for your neat articulation of the tension between individual freedom and corporate responsibility.</p> <p>Another way of putting this, perhaps, is that in the internet we possess an unprecedentedly democratic set of tools which also gifts unprecedented power to those controlling its infrastructure.</p> <p>There is, for me, more thus far to celebrate than there is to mourn in the changes these tools have brought. But you're surely right to highlight the difficulty of acting in advance across many interlocked fields to safeguard against as-yet-indeterminate perils.</p> <p>Your example of the environmental movement laying the groundwork for this debate also seems almost too apt, in that it suggests how little effective action tends collectively to be taken by humanity when a problem \u2013 however menacing \u2013 is nebulous.</p> <p>As a writer, I'd like nothing better than for eloquent explanations and expert insights to create an entirely persuasive movement anatomising technology's opportunities and perils.</p> <p>I can't help feeling, though, that words will never be enough; and that the most necessary counterpoint to the resources corporations and governments possess remains that one field where weight of numbers truly counts, direct action.</p> <p>Here, from Occupy and UK Uncut to the Arab spring, the present is richly stocked with role models and warnings: with devolved, ideologically charged movements embodying many of those virtues you set out.</p> <p>There's surely hope in this notion of privacy defended by avowedly public action \u2013 and safeguarded by those open, evolving digital services you advocate. But only if those protesting are ultimately able to find common cause with those wielding other forms of power.</p> <p>\u25a0 <em>Joss Wright is a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, Oxford University, studying anonymous communications, privacy-enhancing technologies and online censorship. </em></p> <p>\u25a0 <em>Tom Chatfield is a writer and commentator on digital culture.

      "bodyText": "At first there was an audible gasp, then there were cheers. It was the moment 30 friends and family members in the public gallery of the central London employment tribunal heard official recognition that information used by corporate giants in the construction industry to blacklist workers over three decades had been supplied by members of the state's security apparatus. It may come too late for many of the families devastated by the blacklisting of some 3,200 construction workers deemed too leftwing and troublesome for work on building sites. Indeed the following day, Dave Smith, the 46-year-old engineer whose tribunal heard the admission, went on to lose his claim for compensation from one of the firms involved in the blacklisting. As an agency worker, the tribunal decided, he didn't have the right to claim compensation for loss of income, although there was an admission from construction giant Carillion that two of its subsidiaries had \"penalised\" Smith for being a trade unionist. But the testimony of David Clancy, investigations manager at the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), giving evidence in the court, was clear. Clancy told the tribunal he believed that some of the information in the files used to blacklist workers \"could only be supplied by the police or the security services\". It was a satisfying moment. Smith is one of a group of 100 workers who are about to embark on a class action against some 39 companies which they claim breached their rights when they blacklisted them. These admissions could be crucial when Hugh Tomlinson QC takes up the case in the high court. But it was also a disturbing moment for Smith and his friends in the Blacklist Support Group. \"If managers on a building site don't like the fact that I am safety rep because it affects their profit and their deadlines, then I understand why they might do it. I disagree with it, I think it is wrong, but I can understand,\" Smith told the Observer. \"But for the police to be involved is appalling. This is the state linking up with big business basically, and any decent person in a civilised society would think it is appalling. \"This is about human rights. I have not done anything illegal, I am a member of a trade union. I have worked in an attempt to improve health and safety on building sites and yet it appears my employers, the state, security services and the police have been conspiring against me.\" It is just the latest twist in a story that begs to be turned into a movie. Four years ago Steve Acheson, a skilled worker, could not get any work. He couldn't understand it, but then heard about a mysterious blacklist preventing certain people, union representatives in the main, from getting jobs. It was a rumour that had lingered around British building sites for some time. Many people, including Dave Smith, thought and said for many years that it was a myth. But when Acheson took the latest firm to reject him to an industrial tribunal, he found support from a whistleblower, Alan Wainwright, a former manager in the construction industry, who testified that blacklisting did go on. In written evidence, Wainwright said: \"I believe that certain UK construction companies and their mechanical and electrical subsidiaries operate a blacklist procedure to ensure certain electrical operatives do not gain employment on their projects.\" The tribunal found for Acheson and two colleagues, and they were awarded compensation. Reading a report of the development in the Guardian the next day was a member of staff of the Information Commissioner's Office. Within a year, the blacklist was no more. The ICO raided a first-floor office in the Worcestershire town of Droitwich. Officials took away the entire contents of a database suspected to contain the blacklist, as well as invoices from companies in the construction industry that were paying Ian Kerr, the 66-year-old keeper of the data. There they found a database of some 3,200 names, as well as invoices showing that 44 construction firms, including some of the UK's biggest, had used the services of a clandestine organisation called the Consulting Association. The list of subscribers was packed with household names, including Sir Robert McAlpine, Balfour Beatty, Costain and Skanska Construction, although there have been no findings against them. The information held on the individuals was kept in card files and ranged from personal descriptions of the people blacklisted, their families and relationships. Then there were undercover observations of union meetings, left-wing newspaper cuttings and, of course, a smattering of pieces of intelligence that are now believed to have been supplied from either police or MI5 records. But Kerr was fined only \u00a35,000 and while the Consulting Association was closed, only 14 of Kerr's clients were given enforcement notices, demanding they comply with the law. In the three years since the blacklist was first revealed, only three people are understood to have successfully won a claim at a full employment tribunal. The vast majority of those who have attempted to gain redress through the courts have failed. According to campaigners, one reason why legal victories have been so rare is that in some cases lawyers took too long to file court papers and the actions were ruled out of time. Also, some claims were made citing a breach of employment laws that did not exist at the time. As the failed cases mounted up, lawyers began to see fewer reasons for advising clients to go forward. Even those that did make it to a full hearing found employment laws didn't offer complete protection. Electrician Steve Kelly was one of the few to have won compensation, but says it is scant reward. \"I got \u00a32,400 compensation for 10 years of blacklisting,\" he said. \"I tried to get on the Olympic project and was told 'no way, he's the biggest troublemaker in London'.\" Indeed only 600 of the 3,200 names on the blacklist have asked the ICO for a copy of their files. The ICO says it has been unable to pursue the police officers or security services over the confidential information that found its way into Kerr's database. Certainly, neither the card files nor Kerr disclosed who was providing the Consulting Association with the intelligence. \"He had very little to say on the matter,\" Clancy admitted. But all this could now change. The events in the central London employment tribunal on 17 January could be the key for the blacklist victims to get their justice. \"My lawyers were thrilled by Carillion's admission about blacklisting, so we shall have to wait and see what happens next,\" Smith said. It seems that he and his 30 friends from the central London employment tribunal have got their eye on a bigger setting now. \"It's the high court next,\" Smith said. He can't wait to hear the cheers.

As an agency worker, the tribunal decided, he didn't have the right to claim compensation for loss of income, although there was an admission from construction giant Carillion that two of its subsidiaries had \"penalised\" Smith for being a trade&#xa0;unionist.</p> <p>But the testimony of David Clancy, investigations manager at the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), giving evidence in the court, was clear. Clancy told the tribunal he believed that some of the information in the files used to blacklist workers \"could only be supplied by the police or the security services\".</p> <p>It was a satisfying moment. Smith is one of a group of 100 workers who are about to embark on a class action against some 39 companies which they claim breached their rights when they blacklisted them. These admissions could be crucial when Hugh Tomlinson QC takes up the case in the high court.</p> <p>But it was also a disturbing moment for Smith and his friends in the Blacklist Support Group. \"If managers on a building site don't like the fact that I am safety rep because it affects their profit and their deadlines, then I understand why they might do it. I disagree with it, I think it is wrong, but I can understand,\" Smith told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\"But for the police to be involved is appalling. This is the state linking up with big business basically, and any decent person in a civilised society would think it is appalling.</p> <p>\"This is about human rights. I have not done anything illegal, I am a member of a trade union. I have worked in an attempt to improve health and safety on building sites and yet it appears my employers, the state, security services and the police have been conspiring against me.\"</p> <p>It is just the latest twist in a story that begs to be turned into a movie. Four years ago Steve Acheson, a skilled worker, could not get any work. He couldn't understand it, but then heard about a mysterious blacklist preventing certain people, union representatives in the main, from getting jobs.</p> <p>It was a rumour that had lingered around British building sites for some time. Many people, including Dave Smith, thought and said for many years that it was a myth. But when Acheson took the latest firm to reject him to an industrial tribunal, he found support from a whistleblower, Alan Wainwright, a former manager in the construction industry, who testified that blacklisting did go on.</p> <p>In written evidence, Wainwright said: \"I believe that certain UK construction companies and their mechanical and electrical subsidiaries operate a blacklist procedure to ensure certain electrical operatives do not gain employment on their projects.\" The tribunal found for Acheson and two colleagues, and they were awarded compensation.</p> <p>Reading a report of the development in the <em>Guardian</em> the next day was a member of staff of the Information Commissioner's Office. Within a year, the blacklist was no more. The ICO raided a first-floor office in the Worcestershire town of Droitwich. Officials took away the entire contents of a database suspected to contain the blacklist, as well as invoices from companies in the construction industry that were paying Ian Kerr, the 66-year-old keeper of the data.</p> <p>There they found a database of some 3,200 names, as well as invoices showing that 44 construction firms, including some of the UK's biggest, had used the services of a clandestine organisation called the Consulting Association. The list of subscribers was packed with household names, including Sir Robert McAlpine, Balfour Beatty, Costain and Skanska Construction, although there have been no findings against them.</p> <p>The information held on the individuals was kept in card files and ranged from personal descriptions of the people blacklisted, their families and relationships. Then there were undercover observations of union meetings, left-wing newspaper cuttings and, of course, a smattering of pieces of intelligence that are now believed to have been supplied from either police or MI5 records.</p> <p>But Kerr was fined only \u00a35,000 and while the Consulting Association was closed, only 14 of Kerr's clients were given enforcement notices, demanding they comply with the law. In the three years since the blacklist was first revealed, only three people are understood to have successfully won a claim at a full employment tribunal.</p> <p>The vast majority of those who have attempted to gain redress through the courts have failed. According to campaigners, one reason why legal victories have been so rare is that in some cases lawyers took too long to file court papers and the actions were ruled out of time. Also, some claims were made citing a breach of employment laws that did not exist at the time. As the failed cases mounted up, lawyers began to see fewer reasons for advising clients to go forward.</p> <p>Even those that did make it to a full hearing found employment laws didn't offer complete protection. Electrician Steve Kelly was one of the few to have won compensation, but says it is scant reward. \"I got \u00a32,400 compensation for 10 years of blacklisting,\" he said. \"I tried to get on the Olympic project and was told 'no way, he's the biggest troublemaker in London'.\"</p> <p>Indeed only 600 of the 3,200 names on the blacklist have asked the ICO for a copy of their files. The ICO says it has been unable to pursue the police officers or security services over the confidential information that found its way into Kerr's database. Certainly, neither the card files nor Kerr disclosed who was providing the Consulting Association with the intelligence. \"He had very little to say on the matter,\" Clancy admitted.</p> <p>But all this could now change. The events in the central London employment tribunal on 17 January could be the key for the blacklist victims to get their justice. \"My lawyers were thrilled by Carillion's admission about blacklisting, so we shall have to wait and see what happens next,\" Smith said. It seems that he and his 30 friends from the central London employment tribunal have got their eye on a bigger setting now. \"It's the high court next,\" Smith said. He can't wait to hear the cheers.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting: Phil Chamberlain</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "As they swigged their pints in readiness for another unpredictable afternoon at Dean Court, Bournemouth fans were hoping to avoid another calamity \u2013 not so much on the pitch, as off it. Eddie Mitchell, the club's chairman and part-owner, saved Bournemouth from financial ruin in 2009 but his latest antics have left many questioning whether he is fit to run their club. An impromptu visit to the dressing room at half-time against MK Dons last weekend to allow the wife of co-owner Maxim Demin to vent her frustrations, was a new nadir \u2013 one that violated the most sacrosanct footballing territory. Before this unfortunate 1-0 defeat to the runaway league leaders, Charlton, the feeling among supporters was one of simple embarrassment. \"You wouldn't find the American owners of Manchester United or Liverpool letting their wives go in the dressing room, so why should it be any different for us?\" season-ticket holder Matthew Snell said. \"The dressing room is sacred and should be left to the manager and players. That's the one place in the ground that is theirs. The players should be going in there, getting focused, the manager should be getting his point across. \"The new players we've brought in must have been thinking: 'What the hell have I joined here?' No wonder we were awful in the second half, they were probably still thinking about what had happened in the dressing room. \"Fair play to the bloke [Mitchell], he's stabilised us as a business, you can't knock him on that front, but what he did is an embarrassment.\" Other supporters, such as Gary Murawski, described the dressing room visit as \"demeaning\", although the Bournemouth manager, Lee Bradbury has yet to offer any such criticism. Then again, he is not one to rock the boat. Murawski said: \"Mitchell's not a bad guy, but he's going about things the wrong way. He needs to stay away from the microphone. We're the only club in all four divisions that's always getting publicity like this.\" Mitchell's colourful antics have caused consternation several times before, not least in September 2011 when he beckoned disgruntled supporters on to the pitch to meet him \"one-on-one\". His profane outburst on Radio 5 Live when questioned about last weekend's debacle was equally outrageous. Between expletives, Mitchell reasoned that investors had every right to enter the dressing room. Indeed, he described it as their \"entitlement\". \"Modern football is changing. People have got their lives and money on the line. I think the people that are putting money into football are entitled to their say and we believe in expressing our gratitude to everybody who's got a penny or a pound to spend on this club. She [Irena Demin] felt frustrated, we all felt frustrated, but she felt that her opinions and frustration should filter down to the players,\" Mitchell said. Such an argument, incredible to some, contained a degree of logic that some supporters are willing to acknowledge. There is agreement between the owners and supporters that the standard of football has been unsatisfactory this season. \"The football we're playing is boring. Bradbury doesn't have the tactical nous,\" said another long-term season-ticket holder, Roy Parlour. \"If you go to the circus you go there to be entertained. It's the same with the football.\" Facing Charlton was hardly the kind of test that beleaguered Bournemouth needed. The Addicks arrived unbeaten in 11 matches; their tally of 30 goals away from home suggested Bournemouth would spend swathes of the match on the defensive. As it happened, the contest was by no means one-sided. Wes Thomas clipped the outside of the post following a penetrative run into the area in the 18th minute, and both sides scrambled shots at goal that were denied by valiant defending. Had either Wes Fogden or Donal McDermott been able to squeeze the ball through a raft of bodies late in the second half, Bournemouth could have celebrated an unlikely win. Instead, Charlton grabbed a winner in injury time when Yann Kermorgant headed the ball narrowly over the line in a final assault on Bournemouth's goal. \"We played well today,\" Bradbury said. \"But we need to have more of a killer instinct in the final third and we need to keep clean sheets.\" The home fans protested that the late goal had not crossed the line, but it had. At least they went home debating the football match, for a change.",

      "bodyText": "Ferrari have gagged their two drivers Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa from talking to the media amid rising speculation that things are not well with the biggest team in F1. It was the major talking point on the penultimate day of the final testing session in Barcelona as the teams made frantic last-minute adjustments before the opening race of the season, which will take place in Melbourne a week next Sunday. But significant updates to the Red Bull car also distracted a number of the other teams in the paddock. Meanwhile, Jenson Button, who took over from Lewis Hamilton in the McLaren car, was frustrated by hydraulic trouble in the morning before posting the second quickest time of the day in the afternoon. Ferrari, however, dominated the gossip, just as they had done on Friday night when a tweeting rumour suggested that Massa had been sacked by the team. Those stories were completely unfounded. But the Italian press has reacted angrily to the gagging of Alonso and Massa. Massa was due to talk here after his final drive of the weekend in Barcelona, while double world champion Alonso was expected to speak on Sunday. Ferrari said on Twitter: \"We're not very popular in the press room at the moment as we've announced that there will not be any drivers' press meetings at this test. The decision has been taken to keep the whole team fully focused on the job and there is not any polemic intent behind it.\" It was a particularly unpopular decision not just with the Italian but also the Spanish media; Alonso is mobbed whenever he is in action in his native Spain. Last season Ferrari were a distant third in the championship behind the winners Red Bull and McLaren. They lacked innovation and, for most part, seemed happy to copy Red Bull. New technical director Pat Fry has made some comparatively radical changes to this year's car. But there have been suggestions that it has proved difficult to drive in the three testing sessions, and though Massa did put in a fast time it was on the super-soft tyres. Fry said recently: \"We have a lot of work to do.\" Meanwhile there are fears among all Red Bull's pursuers that they are once again falling behind. When the Red Bull car went out today it had incorporated \"some exciting new parts\", according to driver Mark Webber. The car appeared to have a new front wing and even a new remodelled chassis. \"It's effectively a completely new car,\" commented Gary Anderson, the BBC technical analyst.",

      "bodyText": "After Alexander Karosenko voted in Russia's parliamentary elections in December, he was left angry by the feeling that he had been cheated. As the country goes to the polls on Sunday in the first round of presidential elections that could see Vladimir Putin returned to the job for up to 12 more years, Karosenko will be checking the results himself, rather than relying on officials. He is among a new generation of activists, one of tens of thousands who have taken to the streets to demand an honest vote, and will be watching for the fraud that they fear will give Putin a first-round victory. \"I felt that the previous elections were dishonest,\" said Karosenko, 37, an economist, who will arrive at a polling station at 7.30am and spend 13 hours there. \"The results didn't fit with what I saw in Moscow.\" The election, which could lead to Putin being returned for his third term as president, pits him against four candidates, but none is a real threat. Two have lost to him several times already; another told voters, in a previous campaign, to support Putin; and the last is a billionaire oligarch who has yet to convince supporters he is his own man. \"Civil activism is greatly increasing and people want to take part,\" said Nikolai Lyaskin from the Observers' School, one of a number of organisations that have been teaching the new monitors. The elections in December led to widespread accusations of vote-rigging, with convincing videos of the alleged fraud on YouTube. The protests that followed led the opposition to sign up people to monitor the presidential vote. Up to 30,000 observers are expected to take part. \"There are so many, they are starting to compete over who gets what polling station in Moscow,\" said Lyaskin. Observers fear that numerous fraudulent practices could be used, from the widespread use of absentee ballots to simply rewriting the \"protocol\", which lists the votes cast, at the end of the day. Another way, revealed by undercover journalists in December, was the so-called \"carousel\", where groups are bussed around to vote multiple times. Observers will only be able to prevent a certain degree of fraud as there are not enough for all 91,000 polling stations. \"It reduces the number of falsifications, but it depends on the desire to fake results,\" said Andrei Buzin, an expert at Golos, an organisation that monitors election fraud, and co-author of a book on Russian elections called Methods of Falsification. \"If there is a huge desire, it won't reduce it,\" he said. If reports come in that Putin is doing badly during the day, a signal can be sent down to boost his vote, he said. There have already been reports of numerous violations and what the opposition says is a system designed to get the required result. Dmitry Gudkov, an MP, warned on Friday that a new form of election trickery had been invented in the provinces, with ballot boxes containing fake votes hidden in the cars of officials who visit the sick and infirm. Gudkov advised observers to mark ballot boxes with red paint so that they could not be swapped. In St Petersburg, Oksana Dmitrieva, another MP, reported that election officials have been threatened and bribed. The government has reacted to the wave of protests by first denying that there was any meaningful fraud, before introducing some anti-fraud measures.Web cameras have been installed in all polling stations and police have been told to side with observers in any dispute with officials. All these measures are improvements, said Buzin. However, the cameras, which cost nearly \u00a3320m, will not watch over election officials when they sign off the count, he said. After being accused of fraud, Putin responded by accusing the opposition of getting ready to fake the fraud. \"They are preparing to use some mechanisms that would confirm that the elections were falsified. They will stuff ballots themselves, monitor this themselves, and then present this themselves,\" he said. To teach the new observers, actors and celebrities have produced a series of videos. In one, a naked election official refuses to give a copy of the polling station protocol, saying that the photocopier is broken; that there is no paper and that she has no money. \"They may not have clothes, money or a conscience, but they must give you a copy of the protocol. Demand it,\" the observer, who is also naked, says in the video. This new civil activism is what opposition leaders have been striving for. \"It makes them citizens. It makes them grow up,\" said Yevgenia Chirikova, an opposition leader. Putin remains popular outside the major cities, and even if the election is free and fair he is expected to win. \"Maybe he will win anyway,\" said Karosenko, \"But the question is how he will win.\"",

Campaigners, including Jim Swire, whose daughter died in the 1988 Pan Am bombing, say efforts to overturn Megrahi's 2001 conviction for the murder of 270 people will go ahead even after the terminally ill Libyan has died. A book by a former member of Megrahi's legal team forced the Scottish justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill, to deny last week claims of a \"nod and a wink\" understanding, under which Megrahi dropped his appeal in exchange for his compassionate release and return to Libya. Megrahi was convicted by a special court of three Scots judges who sat without a jury in Camp Zeist in the Netherlands, but John Ashton's book, Megrahi, You Are My Jury, quotes the Libyan as saying that he was framed, claiming that evidence seen by prosecutors was never passed to the defence. \"There was a huge pressure to convict and it's clear now there was blatant intellectual dishonesty surrounding his trial,\" said Ashton. \"Along with significant new forensic evidence, it's pretty clear this is an unsafe conviction.\" Evidence not seen by the defence includes a break-in at Heathrow in the early hours of 21 December 1988, that could have allowed a device to be planted among security-screened Pan Am luggage. Doubts have also been cast over payments made to a key prosecution witness and a circuit board fragment found in the wreckage that prosecutors said was part of bomb timer made for Libyan authorities.",

But the veteran Australian second-row, better known throughout the rugby league world as Beaver, admits sharing in one of the most dramatic comebacks in Super League history with the Catalan Dragons at St Helens last Friday was a first even for him. \"I don't know that I've ever won a game after the bell like that,\" said Menzies, who turned 38 in December and who will become the oldest player in the Super League's 17-season history in June, injuries permitting, breaking the record held by Brad Davis, the former Castleford scrum-half, who is now coaching in rugby union with Bath. \"I've been involved in some pretty exciting finishes. There was the one over here with Australia in the 1995 World Cup semi-final, when New Zealand scored a try to get level with us in the last minute and, fortunately, Matthew Ridge, who I played with at Manly, couldn't kick the goal from the touchline to knock us out. But the way it happened at St Helens the other night, after we'd been a long way behind and then had to throw it around everywhere with the kick and the offload and everything to get the try, and then the four-minute wait while the video referee looked at the replays, and then Scotty Dureau still having to convert it from touch to get the win \u2013 that was special.\" For those who have not seen it yet, a topical and suitably French version of the Langtree Park denouement, as the Oscar-winning directors of The Artist might have seen it, is now available on-line. But Menzies and his fellow Dragons have had little time to dwell on a win that marked them out as title contenders. After returning to Perpignan to enjoy the arrival of spring \u2013 \"About 17 degrees today,\" said Menzies from his house near the beach, \"it's not a bad spot to be\" \u2013 they were heading back to the north-west for an even tougher test of their credentials on Sunday against a Wigan team who have been in formidable form. \"The travelling can be tough, especially at this time of year before the direct flights from Perpignan start in the summer,\" says Menzies. \"We get a bus down to Girona, hang around for a bit there, and then the flight over to Manchester or wherever's nearest to the game. But you can turn that into a positive in terms of us spending time together as a group. They were the good signs at St Helens. They had us down on our line for a spell when they were 10 points ahead late on, so another try then would have been it. But we dug in and held on. \"Wigan will be another big test for us because they've been the benchmark for the last couple of years in their attitude and the way they defend. We'll have to see how we can back up.\" Menzies has already enjoyed one fairytale farewell in his outstanding career, having scored a try as Manly demolished Melbourne 40-0 to win the 2008 Grand Final in his last appearance for the club. Now the Catalans, six seasons after they were invited to provide a French flavour to the Super League and only two since they finished rock bottom, seem capable of providing him with another glorious exit should he decide to retire to his beloved Manly this autumn. \"I'm still thinking it over, although for the club's sake I can't leave it too long,\" he said of his dilemma over whether to play on, which is made no easier by the consistent excellence of his performances. \"It's a bit early to be talking about what we could achieve this year, too, with only three games gone. But playing at Wembley would be nice.\"",

But Andy Murray's \u2013 of which there are probably too many for his liking \u2013 are as gracious as any, and he at least did not look devastated after succumbing to Roger Federer for the seventh time in 15 matches, defeat coming as it did 24 hours after he had beaten the world No1, Novak Djokovic. \"I had a couple of good wins this week against [Tomas] Berdych and Novak,\" he told the courtside interrogator in Dubai, \"but it was always going to be tough against Roger. Obviously I would have liked to go one better.\" Federer won his fifth desert title, 7-5, 6-4 in a little over an hour and a half. He has not won a grand slam title in more than two years but the odds on him adding to his glittering collection of 16 are shortening by the tournament. At 30, he is in the golden autumn of his career. Since he leapfrogged Murray into third in the world late last year, he has returned to near his best \u2013 and that is a daunting prospect for his contemporaries. It is fair to say Murray has had the crowd with him most of the week but, even through the filter of television, it seemed there were more than a few deserters when he played the perennial darling of the game. The temptation to regard this as a minor title ought to be resisted because, even though it carries only 500 ranking points, Rafael Nadal was the only notable absentee. Murray ought to be able to lose a final to the other \"greatest player of all time\" without forensic examination of his disappointments in big matches \u2013 except, with the best will in the world, that will not happen until he wins his first major. He is getting closer and he heads for Indian Wells and Miami with a sound, improving game and an on-court demeanour that is noticeably calmer since he took on Ivan Lendl as his coach in January. He beat Djokovic on Friday with as good a service game as he has produced in a long time but it let him down against Federer, even though the winner's 50% first-serve rate was only two points better. For a while they put on a wonderful exhibition of tactical cat-and-mouse tennis, as Federer worked his way into position for those killing angled ground strokes from deep, and Murray harried him with his nagging defensive game. There was little in the first set until the sixth game, when Federer had to save two break points to hold, but the quality rarely dipped. Murray's first crisis arrived at 5-5 and 0-30 down. His serve, as well as his daring under pressure, got him to deuce but, forced to defend the net, he ballooned a reflex backhand long \u2013 and Federer served out to love to pick-pocket the set after 52 minutes. It is tough for Murray to overcome the ingrained instinct that he has a better chance of winning from the back of the court, even on his own serve. These fine calculations are often split-second ones and it is more comfortable for him to rely on trusted strategies. But players such as Federer eat out on caution. He did it to him most painfully in Melbourne two years ago and he did it again on Saturday. Federer, a constant tinkerer with his weapons as he searches for ways to extend his glorious career, raided the net, mostly well-judged, and stretched Murray occasionally with drop shots. Murray hung in, though, and broke back in the second set, with a third a distinct possibility. Had he levelled proceedings, he knows he would have had a decent chance of out-lasting Federer, whose concentration has wavered ever so slightly towards the end of longer matches, most dramatically in the semi-final of the US Open against Djokovic. When Murray dropped serve in the third game of the second with an ill-directed backhand, the energy must have rushed more urgently through Federer's legs. He held to love again for 3-1 and it was not looking good for Murray \u2013 but the Swiss's game now unravelled and Murray clawed his way back. He got a fighting break point with an inspired lob and hit an even better one to level at 3-3. He battled through a break point to hold with his seventh ace but he was defending three more at the next time of asking and a netted backhand gave Federer the chance to serve for the match. Caution no longer an option, Murray pressed him on the volley for 30-30. A rally of the highest quality ended with Murray's backhand dropping on the wrong side of the tape. Federer was a point from victory, but he overcooked a forehand for deuce and Murray still had fire in his eyes. Federer finished it with a crisp, deep forehand that was just out of Murray's reach, a metaphor, some would say, for his journey in tennis so far.",

      "bodyText": "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas admitted he is unsure if he will still be in charge when Chelsea travel to Birmingham City in the FA Cup on Tuesday following his side's 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion. After a poor defensive display and Gareth McAuley's 82nd-minute winner, which meant Chelsea have won once in their past seven Premier League matches, Villas-Boas was asked if he will still be the manager in two days time. He said: \"You will have to ask the owner.\" Neither Roman Abramovich nor any of his executives at Chelsea have publicly backed Villas-Boas. But the manager denied that this would help him and the club now: \"I don't think the club need to back me. We just need to get on with our jobs and everyone has to be better, the players and management staff, everyone. For us to demand to be backed we have to improve. It's not for the owner to come and back us when things go like this.\" He did accept that the loss to West Brom would increase the focus on his job. \"Every defeat that Chelsea suffer piles more pressure on any manager,\" he said. \"Any manager who suffers a defeat at a top club has more pressure on them. It's acceptable that pressure piles. You have to agree that this result puts more pressure on me. We stick to the same position, fifth, but we are now three points behind fourth.\" Villas-Boas admitted West Brom were \"far superior\" as he praised Roy Hogdson's side. \"Full credit to West Brom for their magnificent game, but we weren't good enough on the day,\" he said. \"They won every first ball and every second ball and were far, far superior than us. It was a big disappointment that we didn't build on the win against Bolton and we didn't benefit from this weekend's fixtures. \"It was a poor, poor display. We had an edge after 10 minutes when we had a couple of chances, and one goal earlier than them would have given us extra motivation and drive. But to be fair we deserved to lose because West Brom also had their fair share of chances and were superior. They created lots of problems, had a good intensity in their game and we weren't good enough. It's a big, big disappointment.\" This admission that West Brom were better and that he had failed to raise his team at half-time when the scores were level may be of most concern for Abramovich and supporters. Yet Villas-Boas is still adamant he is the right man to rebuild Chelsea. \"If I didn't believe I was the right person I wouldn't have come. At the moment we have to win games. I'm not worried about the future, the present is more important.\" Hodgson offered his support to the 34-year-old. \"I sympathise and empathise with Andr\u00e9,\" he said. \"The day we football coaches, especially those of us who have some experience, don't stand up for each other and make it clear we identify, empathise and sympathise with other coaches, it's going to be a sad day for football.\" Hodgson was sacked by Liverpool in January of last year after half a season, but he said there is no similarity with Villas-Boas. \"I don't think you can compare my time at Liverpool to Andr\u00e9 at Chelsea,\" he said. \"But you can make comparisons if you want about the fact I was constantly vilified, in particular by the Liverpool press, because they wanted someone different in the job.\"",

      "bodyText": "Not so much a fond farewell as an utterly acrimonious one. There was something fitting that this encounter descended into utter, frantic madness before the final whistle was blown. It seemed an appropriate end to Rangers' latest troubled week that was. For some of the Rangers players, defeat to Heart of Midlothian will mark the culmination of their careers at the club. A decision on the scale of job losses, inevitable given the onset of administration, is now expected on Monday. Those players and fans of a Rangers persuasion left Ibrox in a state of fury. The hosts complained bitterly about the penalty award that preceded Hearts' winner, Jamie Hamill scoring with a rebound after his initial effort was saved. Yet when controversy is cut away, the harsh reality for Ally McCoist as he looks to pick through the wreckage to get to the end of this season is that Rangers are a mediocre team. And that's before any personnel cull. Rangers' predicament shows no immediate sign of improving. Nonetheless, administrators have now been in position for almost three weeks without making any of the playing staff redundant, in what highlights this as an unusual scenario. Members of the Rangers squad have said they are willing to defer wages until the end of the season, with that option rejected by the administrators. The basic fact that about \u00a31m a month needs to be saved in the short-term renders it impossible this can be a painless process. The visiting manager, Paulo Sergio, was guilty of an over-cautions approach from the outset. Kilmarnock's win here a fortnight ago highlighted the stage fright Rangers can suffer at Ibrox, something which has been recurring through the course of this season. Rather than look to exploit any sense of unease, Sergio initially deployed only a single forward with that player, Gary Glen, left so isolated in the early stages he had cause to wonder whether he was playing in the same match as his team-mates. Sergio's mitigating circumstance comes in the Hearts goalkeeping position. The manager is unhappy about being denied the services of his first-choice custodian, Marian Kello, after the Slovak had the audacity to reject a move to Austria Vienna on transfer deadline day. The Hearts hierarchy thereby decided Kello should not be selected for first-team action. His deputy, Jamie MacDonald, was woefully culpable in letting a Steven Davis drive slide through him in first-half stoppage time. That was not so much the only incident of note during the opening period as the only incident at all; Hearts offered nothing in attack and Rangers were wasteful with their final pass. To his credit, Sergio introduced a second striker, Craig Beattie, at half-time. That more adventurous approach roused Hearts into action, with Beattie's first contributions in a maroon shirt positive ones. Yet Rangers should have been sent two goals in front by Carlos Bocanegra. Instead, the defender headed wide of MacDonald's goal from a Rhys McCabe free-kick. Ian Black, who will not feature prominently in any popularity contests among the Rangers support, claimed an excellent equaliser. Andrew Driver's fine work on the left flank created a headed chance for Scott Robinson, which was cleared from the Rangers goal line by Bocanegra. As a subsequent clearance broke to Black, 25 yards out, the midfielder showed terrific poise to curl a first-time shot beyond the reach of Allan McGregor. The game, thereafter hotly contested without clear-cut chances arising, looked to be heading towards a draw before chaos erupted. The referee, Crawford Allan, was firm in his assertion that Dorin Goian had impeded Andy Webster at the time of a Hearts corner, although Rangers were both stunned and infuriated by the penalty award. It looked a fair decision, although Rangers had an earlier strong penalty claim as Danny Grainger appeared to push Lee McCulloch. Amid the melee, Goian was booked with Allan threatening to show a second yellow card to the Romanian for dissent. After a seemingly interminable delay, Hamill watched McGregor beat away his effort from 12 yards. The Hearts player was swift with his reactions, though, in allowing him to score at the second attempt. The response from the stands to this turn of events, unsurprisingly, was vociferously belligerent. Allan left the pitch to concerted abuse, in a bizarre scene where the Rangers players were applauded off and the Hearts contingent celebrated wildly. Nowadays, nothing in these parts bears the resemblance of anything routine. There have now been nine occasions in which Rangers have failed to win on their own patch this season. What is likely to transpire in the coming days will not make McCoist's bid to improve that record any easier.",

      "bodyText": "The government is braced for a series of parliamentary defeats this week over controversial plans to reform legal aid. The House of Lords is expected to vote against key aspects of the legal aid and sentencing bill that critics say will hit some of the most vulnerable in society. Opposition is said to be similar in scale to that which has met the welfare and NHS bills, both of which have already suffered high-profile defeats in the Lords and exposed divisions between the Tories and the Lib Dems. The Ministry of Justice says legal aid reforms will save \u00a3350m and end an ambulance-chasing culture that taxpayers cannot afford. But the Law Society, the independent body that represents solicitors, claims the measures will limit the ability of many people to secure justice, by making the risks of pursuing legal action too high. Its sister organisation, the campaign group Sound Off for Justice, warns that \"at least 650,000 people\" will have \"nowhere to turn for legal advice\" as a result of the reforms, which have also been attacked by a diverse range of groups including Shelter, Netmums and the Women's Institute. Sound Off for Justice estimates 210,000 families and women who previously would have qualified for legal aid in divorce cases will lose out, while almost 50,000 families and couples who benefit from mediation will also no longer benefit. In addition, 6,000 children under the age of 18, 69,000 vulnerable young adults aged 18 to 24, and 32,250 elderly people would no longer be able to access legal aid. An estimated 135,000 welfare claimants who use legal aid to gain access to legitimate benefits will also miss out. The government has offered concessions on clauses that would have restricted legal aid for domestic violence and clinical negligence victims. But it is facing more than 77 amendments from peers. Sound Off for Justice claims that, if the bill proceeds in its current form, the government will cut 8% from the criminal legal aid budget, compared with a 29% cut in the family law cases budget and a 53% reduction in welfare cases funding. A GfK NOP poll conducted for Legal Action Group (LAG), which opposes the reforms, to be published, found 82% of people believed that free advice should be available to those with incomes on or below the national average wage. LAG claims there is rising support in all social classes for employment law advice to be paid for by the state, which it attributes to the public's anxiety over their employment rights due to the economic slowdown. Steve Hynes, director of LAG, said: \"At what point have the government consulted the public on what they want from civil legal aid? The message is very clear from this poll. People believe it is fair for the state to pay for advice on the common legal problems which life can throw at them.\" In the introduction to a new report, to be published tomorrow, Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, warns that abolishing legal aid for issues such as welfare benefits, debt, most housing problems and employment will have \"a devastating impact\" on its ability to provide specialist advice and casework to tens of thousands of people who need help with everyday legal problems. The Ministry of Justice said: \"Victims will be able to receive legal aid to fund the most serious and complex cases, where a 'no win, no fee' agreement is not available, and where the failure to provide funding would breach their human rights.\"",

      "bodyText": "Charities working in the most deprived areas of the country, particularly in the fields of training and education, are being hit hardest by government spending cuts, according to a leaked document that has been circulated to ministers. Councils and other public sector bodies are reacting to a dramatic reduction in central government funding by cutting spending by up to \u00a35bn on charities that have been providing services for them. The internal document says the most deprived 25% of the country will have been most severely hit by the end of this financial year, accounting for more than two-thirds of the spending cuts. This compares to a 7.5% cut in the wealthiest quarter of the country. The estimation of the impact of government cuts, drawn up for the Cabinet Office and seen by Nick Hurd, the civil society minister, says: \"The data suggests that cuts to civil society organisations are likely to have a bigger impact on deprived areas.\" The document warns that cuts being passed on by councils will see charities losing up to 43.4% of their income this financial year. It adds: \"The data suggests that it is highly likely that public sector agencies are passing on disproportionate cuts to civil society organisations (ie, higher cuts to civil society funding than they themselves are facing).\" The hardest-hit areas are education and training (\u00a3335.8m), children and families (\u00a3287m), health and social care (\u00a3285.1m) and homelessness (\u00a3112.3m). Of particular concern, in the wake of the fury provoked by the rewards enjoyed by Emma Harrison, the former chairman of welfare-to-work firm A4e, is that charities in the same sector report losing \u00a3201.5m this year. A4e holds contracts worth \u00a3438m, and Harrison enjoyed an \u00a38.6m shares dividend last year [see footnote]. A Whitehall source added: \"The message from the analysis was clear. The plight of charities carrying out vital public services is in dire straits. It is particularly bad for those who work in education and training, but the impact is across the board. For example, mental health charities, who are trying to stop people killing themselves, are finding they are receiving more calls than ever, but are unable to cope with demand.\" A survey carried out last year by YoungMinds, Britain's leading children and young people's mental health charity, revealed that half of local authorities had cut budgets in this area. It is understood that the 27-page document, produced for ministers by the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo), was circulated within the Cabinet Office and the Treasury. Further findings were: \u25a0 Charities in the north-west and north-east of England are over-represented in the group of organisations which have appealed for help from a \u00a3100m government transition fund. \u25a0 In the 20 most deprived local authorities, 450 organisations have lost \u00a3142.5m, compared with a \u00a33.6m loss for 22 organisations in the 20 least deprived areas. \u25a0 Sixteen charities who appealed to the government's transition fund for help suffered a total loss of funding from local authorities, threatening their existence. \u25a0 The 566 organisations active in homelessness have, on average, lost \u00a3366,679, 50.33% of their annual income. Gareth Thomas, the shadow civil society minister, said the report, which was compiled last March, had been ignored by ministers. He said: \"Charities and community groups across the country have taken a huge and completely disproportionate hit in funding, just when demands for their help are rising fast. \"David Cameron's claim that in his 'big society' we're all in it together was never credible, but this leaked report confirms that ministers were being given independent evidence showing charities were going to be hit very hard by funding cuts, with the poorest and most deprived areas being hit hardest. Yet ministers have failed to act.\" A spokesman for Acevo declined to comment. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: \"Acevo's report is a misrepresentation, as it is only based on applicants to the (Transition) Fund. We recognise this is a difficult time for charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises and that's why we set up the Transition Fund to help them manage the transition to a tighter funding environment and take advantage of future opportunities presented by the big society.\" \u2022 The following correction was published on 11 March 2012: \"Deprived areas hit hard by cuts in charity funds\" (News) spoke of the fury provoked by the rewards enjoyed by Emma Harrison, former chair of the welfare-to-work firm A4e, and said she received an \u00a38.6m shares dividend last year when charities were facing deep cuts, but she actually took the dividend in April 2010.",

Yet ministers have failed to act.\" A spokesman for Acevo declined to comment.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: \"Acevo's report is a misrepresentation, as it is only based on applicants to the (Transition) Fund. We recognise this is a difficult time for charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises and that's why we set up the Transition Fund to help them manage the transition to a tighter funding environment and take advantage of future opportunities presented by the big society.\"</p> <p>\u2022 The following correction was published on 11 March 2012:<br>\"Deprived areas hit hard by cuts in charity funds\" (News) spoke of the fury provoked by the rewards enjoyed by Emma Harrison, former chair of the welfare-to-work firm A4e, and said she received an \u00a38.6m shares dividend last year when charities were facing deep cuts, but she actually took the dividend in April 2010.</p>",

The archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, will also warn that the paedophile priest controversy is far from over for the Irish church. In a frank admission of the church's failings on American primetime TV , Martin will say: \"There's a real danger today of people saying: 'the child abuse scandal is over, let's bury it, let's move on'. \"It isn't over. Child protection and the protection of children is something which will go on for the rest of our lives and into the future because the problems are there.\" Regarded as one of the most progressive thinkers in the Irish Catholic church, Martin will appear on CBS's top current affairs show 60 Minutes. He is one of the most senior Catholics to openly criticise the way the hierarchy has handled the abuse allegations. The head of Dublin's Catholics will tell the programme that \"now is not the time to forget\" and that the \"problems are still there\" when it comes to the scandals that have rocked the church and undermined its political power and authority in the Irish Republic. The interview comes as Irish Catholic leaders wait to hear the response of the pope over an invitation for him to attend the International Eucharistic Congress in Dublin this June. Archbishop Martin has warned that the church in Ireland needs to make further progress and carry out major reforms before any visit by Pope Benedict could take place. When Martin was appointed archbishop of Dublin he handed over 65,000 files to the Murphy commission, which was tasked with investigating clerical child abuse in the Irish capital. In his sermons he also confronted the church's leadership over the way they covered up past child abuse scandals by moving priests suspected of being paedophiles into new parishes in other parts of Ireland or abroad. He also met organisations representing the victims of clerical abuse. The controversy has also produced a major diplomatic spat between the Vatican and the present Irish government. The Fine Gael-Labour coalition is planning to close the Irish embassy to the Vatican while the taoiseach Enda Kenny last year launched an unprecedented attack on the Holy See for the way it mishandled the child abuse crisis in Ireland.",

Keep in mind that some hints may read like \"inside jokes\" and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others' enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1.

      "bodyText": "Neil Lennon refused to criticise his Celtic players after seeing their winning streak end with a 1-1 draw against Aberdeen at Pittodrie. Anthony Stokes looked to have put the visitors on course for a 21st consecutive victory in domestic competitions when he scored after 28 minutes. However, Aberdeen equalised when Gavin Rae's left-foot shot took a wicked deflection off the Celtic debutant Andre Blackman and beat the goalkeeper Fraser Forster a minute before the break. The Celtic manager felt the midday kick-off, coming on the back of a full fixture card of midweek international matches, contributed to his team's below-par performance. Lennon said: \"I don't know who scheduled the game but that has certainly not done us any favours. I think that has played as much a part as Aberdeen's performance in this run ending. The result is no surprise considering the call-offs and the schedules that the players have had this week. It is obvious that they are tired, mentally and physically. The draw was totally understandable in the circumstances.\" A spirited second-half display from Aberdeen helped them continue their own unbeaten run, which now stretches to 12 games. The Aberdeen manager, Craig Brown, was disappointed with a point. \"We only got one point so it is moderately pleasing \u2013 the better team drew. \"We were desperate to get three points but I suppose when a team comes having won 20 games in a row and we get a draw it is satisfactory.\" Motherwell beat Dunfermline 2-0 at East End Park to extend the Pars' miserable run without a home victory in the Scottish Premier League to 15. Dunfermline's goalkeeper, Chris Smith, gifted the visitors the opening goal when he let Michael Higdon's weak shot slip through his grasp in the 64th minute. Henrik Ojamaa then doubled the visitors' lead when he powered a shot beyond the helpless keeper six minutes later. Victory for Motherwell moves them within three points of Rangers in second place while Dunfermline are now four points adrift at the foot of the league table. Dean Shiels and Cillian Sheridan were both sent off after being punished for simulation as Kilmarnock and St Johnstone shared a goalless draw at Rugby Park. Two minutes from the break Alan Mannus saved a weak penalty from the Kilmarnock midfielder Shiels after the Saints left-back Callum Davidson was adjudged by the referee Craig Charleston to have pulled down Gary Harkins in the box. The former Hibs player, who was booked for going in too hard for the rebound, compounded his error when he was dismissed in the 75th minute after picking up his second yellow card for simulation in the Saints penalty area. There was more drama to follow two minutes from time as the Saints striker Sheridan, booked in the 70th minute for kicking the ball away, was shown his second yellow card by Charleston, also for simulation, this time inside the Killie penalty area. Neither side did enough to deserve all three points but Saints continue their quest for a European spot. Hibernian eased their relegation worries with a 0-0 draw against St Mirren at Easter Road. The Buddies goalkeeper Craig Samson saved a first-half James McPake header and second-half shots in quick succession from Leigh Griffiths and the substitute David Wotherspoon as 11th-placed Hibs moved four points clear of Dunfermline at the foot of the table.",

His trainer, Paul Nicholls, remained cautious about his chances of lining up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup a week on Friday but was encouraged by a morning canter by the horse. \"He's going in the right direction very quickly,\" Nicholls told Channel 4. \"Clifford [Baker] had difficulty pulling him up, which is a good sign with him.\" Through his Betfair column, Nicholls described the horse as having \"a bit more of a buzz and a spring in his step\". Ballabriggs was fourth at Kelso on Saturday on his final prep-run before the Grand National, but that was enough to have his trainer, Donald McCain, radiating satisfaction. The horse won last year's National after being second at odds-on in this same race and his jockey, Jason Maguire, reckoned this was a better performance than he had put up 12 months ago. \"He's a big horse and he takes plenty of graft and the only way to get him ready is at the races,\" said McCain.",

Andy Keogh gave the home side a 16th-minute lead, but Hal Robson-Kanu equalised shortly after half time, and Adam Le Fondre scored the winner with 14 minutes remaining. There was a hint of controversy about the goal; Le Fondre, offside at the start of the move, rejoined play in its second phase. The win moves Reading to within a point of second-placed West Ham United, who visit Cardiff City on Sunday. \u2022 Reading's comeback was eclipsed by that of Watford, who were 2-0 down at home to Burnley, Jay Rodriguez scoring for the Clarets just before half time, Nyron Nosworthy putting through his own net just after it. But Nosworthy made amends almost immediately, grabbing a goal at the right end, before Alexander Kacaniklic and Troy Deeney hit a quickfire double to turn the match around. \u2022 Middlesbrough moved back into the play-off places with a solid 3-1 win at crisis-hit Portsmouth. Barry Robson's penalty on 56 minutes set Boro on their way, Matthew Bates and Marvin Emnes also scoring; Greg Halford's penalty for Pompey wasn't much of a consolation, while Rhys Williams' late dismissal made no odds whatsoever. \u2022 Birmingham City lost their unbeaten home league record to Nottingham Forest last week, and looked like rebounding well against Derby County, Erik Huseklepp and Marlon King putting Chris Hughton's side 2-0 up. But Derby replied with two goals in five second-half minutes from Steven Davies and Theo Robinson. \u2022 At the bottom, a late El-Hadji Diouf penalty earned a draw for Doncaster at home to Brighton, cancelling out Craig Mackail-Smith's first-half strike. Rovers are now level on points with Portsmouth. Coventry, who went down 2-0 at Leicester, David Nugent and Jermaine Beckford with the goals at the King Power Stadium, complete the bottom three. League One \u2022 All eyes on Sheffield Wednesday, who preposterously sacked Gary Megson during the week. His replacement Dave Jones started out with a goalless draw at struggling Rochdale. \u2022 Wednesday hearts will have been raised by events at Bramall Lane, however: Sheffield United went in at the break 2-0 up against Oldham, Matthew Lowton and Ched Evans the scorers. But Lowton would end the day the villain, not the hero. He was sent off for a late challenge on James Wesolowski midway through the second half with the score 2-1, Richard Cresswell having already put through his own net. Oldham almost immediately equalised through Kieran Lee, and after Harry Maguire collected United's second red card of the day, former Wednesday star Shefki Kuqi converted a last-minute penalty. \u2022 Two first-half goals from Scotland striker Jordan Rhodes helped Huddersfield on their way to a three-goal lead at Bury by the 29-minute mark, and took his personal season's total to 30 from 28 games, a remarkable stat. But Steven Schumacher pulled a goal back almost immediately, and an equally remarkable comeback was on. Lenell John-Lewis made it 2-3 on 70 minutes, before Ashley Eastham grabbed the equaliser for Bury deep into injury time. League Two \u2022 Expect some entertaining/idiosyncratic/tiresome (delete according to preference) press conference action starring Paolo Di Canio. His Swindon team went down 2-0 at Thames Valley arch-rivals Oxford United. Asa Hall and Oli Johnson were the heroes for Oxford, who consolidate their position in the play-offs. All galling enough for Swindon, without the added insult of playing against ten men for 79 minutes, Oxford striker James Constable getting his marching orders at the Kassam early doors. \u2022 Swindon's four-point lead at the top of the table was cut by a point, thanks to Cheltenham's late comeback at home to Northampton. The Cobblers were two goals to the good through Brett Williams and Adebayo Akinfenwa, but a Daryl Duffy penalty on 70 minutes reduced the arrears, and they were wiped out deep into added time by the same player. \u2022 Rock-bottom Northampton will be doubly - nay, trebly - sick, as the two teams directly above them both won.

The 85-year-old comic, who died last week after a long illness, was described at the funeral in St Patrick's Church as the \"prime minister of fun\" by the retired bishop of Derry Edward Daly. Daly, a long-time friend of Carson, told mourners that making people laugh was the comedian's \"mission in life\". \"In his live performances, he could light up an audience and make them laugh and laugh. That is surely a great service to humanity,\" he told the congregation.

In life Carson was a unifying figure across Northern Ireland even during the worst years of the Troubles. In the 1950s he had served in the Parachute Regiment before breaking into showbiz where he became a household name following three wins on the television show Opportunity Knocks. After the blessing the funeral procession moved towards Sailortown, the Belfast docks are known as \"Little Italy\" where Carson grew up in a family of Italian descent.

      "bodyText": "Grace Dent, Guardian writer, has tweeted 43,081 times Twitter selling two years of my archived tweets to Datasift for them to fillet, exploit and make merry with makes me feel rather bilious. Once upon a time, I loved Twitter. Nowadays it's beginning to feel like a seemingly amiable and groovy landlord who secretly had a hole drilled in my bathroom wall, and is now touting round \"MILF shaving armpitz sexytimes picz\" to the highest bidder. Yuk. I don't want the flippant utterances that passed through my head and on to screen since 2010 mechanically harvested and used to flog me tat. Twitter need to stop presenting their product like a delicate, chirpy pale blue sparrow, then behaving like a giant, dirty, corpse-stripping vulture. And I loathe that any internet-centred violation of my privacy and rights like this is always switched back on me with a \"Well, you should have known!\" smirk, as if anything goes. Incidentally, I have a running, rather poor, in-joke with friends. Every time a twitchfork mob begins harassing some poor tweeter about crimes of thought, I add in the hearsay \"And I heard they bummed a puffin!\" I told you it was a poor joke, but it's been giving me solid lolz now since 2008. Can I just point out now that I'm not actually in the marketplace to purchase, rent or have a mini-break with my own personal puffin? Neither am I in need of a puffin taxidermy at home learning course or have any appetite for puffin meat sausages. They were just silly tweets. They didn't mean anything. I do it every day, only now I'm not so sure I want to. Michael Hogan, freelance writer, has tweeted 21,135 times I'm a Twitter addict too \u2013 not to mention partial to the odd ROFL about sea-bird sodomy \u2013 but must confess, the news of our favourite timewaster flogging off our old 140-character wibblings barely caused a flicker on my bothered-o-meter. Whinging that Bluebird &amp; Failwhale Corp are suddenly trying to make some dollah is like a goatee-stroking student moaning their favourite band has \"gone all commercial\" now they're shifting a few units and moving up to gig venues with a less sticky carpet and flushing loos. And, yes, I'm suppressing a smirk but of course you should have known. We've all watched enough Alan Sugar and Duncan Bannatyne to know how the business world works. (Rudely, with a weird face.) Like you, I'm a freelance writer who works alone, often in nightwear while nibbling unglamorous snacks, so Twitter's a sanity-saver. It provides virtual company and long-distance LOLZ. It's office chat without the need to loiter around an actual watercooler, tolerate the tedious ones and smell their coffee breath. This seems such a small price to pay for such a service. When you hang out in the pub with your 3D friends, the tax is buying the odd round. Facilities are for the use of paying customers only. Unless you're bursting, do that \"looking around for someone I'm meeting\" thing and the barman turns a blind eye. GD Oh, Michael. Lordy knows, I've spent enough time in Pizza Express fighting off bouts of dry humping to know there's no such thing as a free lunch. Four years hanging out on Twitter was bound to come at a price. Promoted tweets? Ads on apps? All fine with me. Flogging our conversations from 2010. No, that's bad. What weirds me out most is how we just leave Twitter to its own devices. \"Oh help yourself, mate,\" we sigh, adjusting our petticoats to be mounted. When Tesco began advertising Workfare places last month all of us sharp, feisty keyboard warriors took against this topic on Twitter instantly with great gusto. The same people don't turn a hair at the onwards stomp of Twitter, 300 million people's data being sold to random companies, but we've neither an opinion nor any real idea what to do or plans to leave as it's so bloody useful. And have you ever tried prodding Twitter about anything? Go and visit the Help section, it's one long round of Malcolm Tucker \"NOMFP\" (not my fucking problem) responses. Incidentally I am very admiring of your laissez-faire approach to Twitter copyright and I hope you will enjoy my Christmas 2012 toilet book, Funny Shit I Stole Off of Michael Hogan's Twitter Feed, by Grace \"cut and paste lolz\" Dent. I think it will be one of my best. MH As long as the book is racked alongside such classic stocking fillers as Do Ants Have Arseholes?, Golfing With Cats and Purple Ronnie's Little Book of Bottom Burps, I'd be honoured. But come on, it's not like they're pilfering our tweets to insert into the scripts of Adam Sandler blockbusters with no payback for us poor impoverished \"creatives\". Or using them as lolly stick LOLZ \u2013 although they'd probably be about the right length. Instead they'll be \"extracting insights and trends that relate to brands, businesses, financial markets, news and public opinion\". Well, if they can extract any insights from my displacement activity dronings about telly, cricket and Engelbert Humperdinck, not to mention participation in interminable punning hashtag games, frankly they're welcome to them.

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>Grace Dent, Guardian writer, has tweeted 43,081 times </strong></h2> <p>Twitter selling two years of my archived tweets to Datasift for them to fillet, exploit and make merry with makes me feel rather bilious. Once upon a time, I loved Twitter. Nowadays it's beginning to feel like a seemingly amiable and groovy landlord who secretly had a hole drilled in my bathroom wall, and is now touting round \"MILF shaving armpitz sexytimes picz\" to the highest bidder. Yuk. I don't want the flippant utterances that passed through my head and on to screen since 2010 mechanically harvested and used to flog me tat. Twitter need to stop presenting their product like a delicate, chirpy pale blue sparrow, then behaving like a giant, dirty, corpse-stripping vulture. And I loathe that any internet-centred violation of my privacy and rights like this is always switched back on me with a \"Well, you should have known!\" smirk, as if anything goes. Incidentally, I have a running, rather poor, in-joke with friends. Every time a twitchfork mob begins harassing some poor tweeter about crimes of thought, I add in the hearsay \"And I heard they bummed a puffin!\" I told you it was a poor joke, but it's been giving me solid lolz now since 2008. Can I just point out now that I'm not actually in the marketplace to purchase, rent or have a mini-break with my own personal puffin? Neither am I in need of a puffin taxidermy at home learning course or have any appetite for puffin meat sausages. They were just silly tweets. They didn't mean anything. I do it every day, only now I'm not so sure I want to.</p> <h2><strong>Michael Hogan, freelance writer, has tweeted 21,135 times </strong></h2> <p>I'm a Twitter addict too \u2013 not to mention partial to the odd ROFL about sea-bird sodomy \u2013 but must confess, the news of our favourite timewaster flogging off our old 140-character wibblings barely caused a flicker on my bothered-o-meter. Whinging that Bluebird &amp; Failwhale Corp are suddenly trying to make some dollah is like a goatee-stroking student moaning their favourite band has \"gone all commercial\" now they're shifting a few units and moving up to gig venues with a less sticky carpet and flushing loos. And, yes, I'm suppressing a smirk but of course you should have known. We've all watched enough Alan Sugar and Duncan Bannatyne to know how the business world works. (Rudely, with a weird face.) Like you, I'm a freelance writer who works alone, often in nightwear while nibbling unglamorous snacks, so Twitter's a sanity-saver. It provides virtual company and long-distance LOLZ. It's office chat without the need to loiter around an actual watercooler, tolerate the tedious ones and smell their coffee breath. This seems such a small price to pay for such a service. When you hang out in the pub with your 3D friends, the tax is buying the odd round. Facilities are for the use of paying customers only. Unless you're bursting, do that \"looking around for someone I'm meeting\" thing and the barman turns a blind eye.</p> <p><strong>GD </strong>Oh, Michael. Lordy knows, I've spent enough time in Pizza Express fighting off bouts of dry humping to know there's no such thing as a free lunch. Four years hanging out on Twitter was bound to come at a price. Promoted tweets? Ads on apps? All fine with me. Flogging our conversations from 2010. No, that's bad. What weirds me out most is how we just leave Twitter to its own&#xa0;devices. \"Oh help yourself, mate,\"&#xa0;we sigh, adjusting our petticoats to be mounted. When Tesco began advertising Workfare places last month all of us sharp, feisty&#xa0;keyboard warriors took against this topic on Twitter instantly with great gusto. The same people don't turn a hair at the onwards stomp of Twitter, 300&#xa0;million people's data being sold to random companies, but we've neither an opinion nor any real idea what to do or plans to leave as it's so bloody useful. And have you ever tried prodding Twitter about anything? Go and visit the Help section, it's one long round of Malcolm Tucker \"NOMFP\" (not my fucking problem) responses. Incidentally I am very admiring of your laissez-faire approach to Twitter copyright and I hope you will enjoy my Christmas 2012 toilet book, <em>Funny Shit I Stole Off of Michael Hogan's Twitter Feed</em>, by Grace \"cut and paste lolz\" Dent. I think it will be one of my&#xa0;best.</p> <p><strong>MH </strong>As long as the book is racked alongside such classic stocking fillers as <em>Do Ants Have Arseholes?</em>, <em>Golfing With Cats</em> and <em>Purple Ronnie's Little Book of Bottom Burps</em>, I'd be honoured. But come on, it's not like they're pilfering our tweets to insert into the scripts of Adam Sandler blockbusters with no payback for us poor impoverished \"creatives\". Or using them as lolly stick LOLZ \u2013 although they'd probably be about the right length. Instead they'll be \"extracting insights and trends that relate to brands, businesses, financial markets, news and public opinion\". Well, if they can extract any insights from my displacement activity dronings about telly, cricket and Engelbert Humperdinck, not to mention participation in interminable punning hashtag games, frankly they're welcome to them. Our \"content\" (sorry for the swear) enters the public domain the moment we tweet it, so this is less of a copyright issue and more of a privacy one. Twitter's got to make money somehow. I'd rather have this market research guff going on in the background somewhere than the sticky-beaked \"brand interactions\" of the dark-blue Death Star that is Facebook.

Wasps ended a run of nine successive Premiership defeats in the opposite of style \u2013with six penalties, all from Nicky Robinson, and barely a whiff of a try \u2013to move them eight points above Newcastle at the bottom. Irish had problems of their own, having lost their last three Premiership matches. Their only away victory had come in Northampton in September and they were thus ideal opponents for Wasps in their grim quest for survival. It was a desperate encounter, chronically short on quality. There were elements of Wasps' game that worked well, such as their counter-rucking, but it was all collective, the result of work on the training ground. Individual inspiration was rare, scarcer still after Wasps' Joe Simpson, the third scrum-half in the England squad, suffered a dislocated left shoulder on 27 minutes. London Irish were almost as formulaic, but less efficient. It was dispiriting to see Delon Armitage all of a dither at full-back. A player who made his reputation by trusting his instinct was bedevilled by indecision, taking so long to decide what to do when in possession that he was regularly sacked and turned over. The game settled into a shoot-out between the two Welsh outside-halves, Robinson and Steve Shingler, the Irish pivot whose bid to play for Scotland is the subject of an appeal to the International Rugby Board. The Scots may wonder if the battle is worth it: Shingler kicked two out of three penalties in the opening half, but conceded one through a dozy offside and got away with having a kick charged down near his own line by Dominic Waldouck. With Simpson off the field, Waldouck played on after the interval with a pronounced limp. Irish were not helped by the referee, Martin Fox, being unwilling to allow the dominant scrum to assert itself while the England reserve hooker Rob Webber had such a wonky throw into the lineout that it was a surprise Irish did not kick to touch more. Irish were fortunate to be level 6-6 at the break, and two more Robinson penalties in the third quarter put Wasps in control before, out of nowhere, Jonathan Joseph freed Sailosi Tagicakibau, who broke two weak tackles to go over. Shingler's conversion gave Irish the lead for the first time with 15 minutes to go, but two subsequent scrums presented Wasps with six more points and their first league victory since October.",

      "bodyText": "Philippine duck, Anas luzonica, photographed in Bislig, Surigao del Sur province, Mindanao, the Philippines. Image: Nick Athanas/Tropical Birding, 4 March 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Canon EOS 7D Question: If you woke up one morning and saw this handsome bird flying overhead, what sort of habitat would you be standing in? Would you need to wear a coat or would you instead need to wear bug spray? Where in the world would you be? Would you be excited to see this bird? If so, why? Can you identify this mystery bird's taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult Philippine duck, Anas luzonica, a distinctively-marked duck that is endemic to the Philippines. The Philippine duck is placed into one of the most recognisable taxonomic families for birds, Anatidae, which includes ducks, geese and swans. However, the genus, Anas, is a different story. It is a maddening tangle of poorly understood and often fuzzy relationships. This confusion stems from the rapid and recent radiation of Anas species, which renders most molecular markers ineffective at resolving taxonomic relationships. Further, as anyone who watches birds knows, Anas species readily hybridise with their congeners as well as other family members, usually producing fertile offspring. Thus, introgression \"muddies the genetic waters\", rendering mitochondrial DNA mostly useless for resolving phylogenetic relationships whilst nuclear DNA evolves too slowly to reveal anything of value. The Philippine duck is lumped into the Pacific clade of Anas, along with the Hawaiian duck, A. wyvilliana, Laysan duck, A. laysanensis, Pacific black duck, A. superciliosa and the extinct Mariana mallard, Anas (platyrhynchos) oustaleti. The Philippine duck is distinctively marked, with a cinnamon head, with a black crown and nape, a bold black stripe through the eye, bluish-grey bill with a black nail, brownish-grey body, and greyish-brown legs. The upperwing coverts (known as the speculum in ducks) is an iridescent blue-green with black borders and a narrow white edge, and the underwing is white. The sexes are look the same, and juveniles are slightly paler than adults. This large dabbling duck is found a variety of wetland habitats, in both freshwater and saltwater, including watercourses inside forest, mangroves, and even open sea. They feed on fish, shrimps, insects, rice and young vegetation. This species is sedentary. Unfortunately, due to high levels of hunting and trapping, clearing of mangroves for shrimp farms, development of wetlands for aquaculture and fishponds, and escalating levels of pesticide use on rice paddies, this species is in rapid decline -- dare I say that their numbers are plummeting at a dizzying rate? In 1993, the Philippine duck's population was estimated at 10,000-100,000, but fewer than 10,000 birds were thought to remain by 2002. There are 5,000 or fewer Philippine ducks alive today. If we aren't careful, this species could disappear in the blink of an eye. Here's a video of a feeding Philippine duck, which gives you a good idea of its size relative to other waterfowl and, if you listen carefully, you can also hear its voice (uploaded 15 November 2011): Visit dolhijn's YouTube channel [video link]. You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

      "bodyText": "Bit by bit Sir Ian McGeechan, the Scot asked by Twickenham to help find the next England coach, is leading Bath out of their troubled times, although the knight's ambitions for a place in the Heineken Cup next season still looks a way off. Despite winning six of their last seven games, three of Bath's five remaining league matches are against the top four and the recent acceleration in form will have to move into overdrive if they are to take a place at Europe's top table. Nevertheless, five tries in a game and 21 points in 12 minutes against a team that last week beat the champions, suggests the confidence is beginning to bubble and with more of his walking wounded returning from the sick bay, McGeechan has reasons to smile. There are suggestions of good news on another front, with the Charity Commissioners due to announce whether they will stand in the way of owner Bruce Craig's ambitions to revamp the Rec. The smile was temporarily wiped from McGeechan's face when Worcester, possessors of the limpest attack in the Premiership, scored their 14th try of the season and threatened to add a 15th. Jake Abbott pulled off robbery at a ruck to set up the smoothest of counterattacks that ended with Chris Pennell putting wing Tom Arscott over in the corner. Andy Goode came within a whisker of picking out Miles Benjamin with a cross-kick before Bath came storming back with tries in the 18th, 25th and 30th minutes. First Tom Biggs almost sidestepped his way to the line, before finally making the extra metre when the ball was recycled by Matt Carraro, then Matt Banahan benefited from some hard work by prop Charlie Beech and a clever off-load by Francois Louw, before Michael Claassens found just enough space to wriggle through for the third. With Tom Heathcote adding the extras on all three occasions, Bath had gone from seven points down to 14 up and even with 50 minutes left on the clock there was no way back for Worcester. Carraro would have claimed the fourth nine minutes into the second half had not the referee, Greg Garner, impeded the Worcester defence, but the bonus point was barely delayed, Claassens sliding in for his second from the resulting scrum. Biggs went the length of the field for a fifth with Benjamin adding a late score for Worcester.",

      "bodyText": "Richard Jolly Ewood Park Around half an hour in and with their side leading, the Aston Villa supporters responded to a staple of the Ewood Park songbook, \"Kean Out\", with a cheeky chorus, ostensibly saluting the departed Robbie Keane but actually taunting Blackburn's manager. \"There's only one Keano,\" they chanted. Ridiculing Steve Kean has become a ritual at Ewood Park but this was a match where he emerged in credit, with a point procured because of his decisive action. After an awful first half, he removed the ineffectual Mauro Formica and the execrable Radosav Petrovic. He introduced Marcus Olsson, who added much-needed pace, and David Dunn, scorer of the equaliser. The manager himself was the catalyst for a comeback. Often accused of producing a particularly one-eyed interpretation of events, there was a bracing honesty to his analysis. \"In the first half, we were really, really poor, probably as bad as we've been for a number of months,\" Kean said. \"I don't think we could have got any worse. We had a few choice words at half-time.\" Whatever its content, the talk rejuvenated a Blackburn side who had been limping to defeat. They responded with urgency and, courtesy of Dunn, were rewarded with a point. If fans tend to suffer during relegation battles, one came to Rovers' rescue. \"He's a Blackburn supporter through and through; his whole family have been Blackburn fans all their lives,\" said Kean. \"He knows what it means.\" The equaliser denied the other under-pressure Glaswegian manager, Alex McLeish, the validation of victory. Yet it began so promisingly for him. Blackburn's defensive record constituted an open invitation to attack and, even in the absence of Keane and the injured Darren Bent, Villa responded. McLeish put his natural conservatism to one side and played with more ambition. He restored the creative contingent of Stephen Ireland and Charles N'Zogbia to the starting lineup and the latter duly extended Rovers' unwanted record. They have not kept a clean sheet this season and, given the generosity of their back four, they are unlikely to. Villa's goal illustrated why. Carlos Cu\u00e9llar strolled forward from the halfway line, unchecked for much of the way before he evaded Morten Gamst Pedersen's rather weak attempts to halt him, and found N'Zogbia. The Frenchman's shot, struck with vicious power, flew past Paul Robinson. \"A great inspirational run from Carlos and a great goal,\" McLeish said. It was only N'Zogbia's second strike since his \u00a310m move from Wigan, a meagre return from a major talent. A third should have followed, the winger meeting Ireland's pass with a shot that Robinson clawed away. \"He could have had a hat-trick,\" McLeish said. \"In the first half we were absolutely exceptional and could have been two or three up but we lacked that ruthlessness and that has blighted us this season.\" They were thwarted, too, by the outstanding Robinson as Rovers' new captain constituted a one-man resistance; but for his 80th-minute save from Gabriel Agbonlahor, Blackburn would surely have succumbed. \"If it wasn't for his performance, the game could have been beyond us,\" Kean said. Yet after his intervention, Rovers rallied. \"We got closer to Villa's midfield because we were miles off them,\" Kean said. They gained a foothold in the game and Scott Dann headed on to the roof of the net, while Shay Given parried Junior Hoilett's snap-shot and Pedersen's crisp volley. But the pressure told, with Bradley Orr crossing for Dunn to head in. \"He has got a very good head in terms of his intelligence and he stole in between centre-back and full-back,\" McLeish said. \"He may be in his twilight years but he made a difference.\" So, in his own way, did Dunn's much-mocked manager.",

      "bodyText": "Equalling records cannot get any more routine than this. Bolton barely made Manchester City sweat as Roberto Mancini's team racked up their 19th consecutive home win in the league, matching a feat only previously achieved in the Premier League era by their red-clad neighbours, who did likewise last year. For a long time here it seemed the only thing that could prevent City from opening up a five-point lead over United at the top of the table ahead of the latter's game at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday was the haphazard finishing of Mario Balotelli, who squandered a bevy of chances in a game that City dominated. The Italian was a risk of being dropped for the game given that newspaper photographs published in the buildup showed him emerging from a Liverpool nightspot at 3am on Friday, but Mancini decided to start the striker pending an investigation. \"If it is true, I will be disappointed because it is not correct for a professional,\" said Mancini of his controversy-magnet of a compatriot. \"I will talk to him and, if it is true, I will fine him the maximum [two weeks wages],\" added Mancini before, only half-jokingly, commenting: \"Maybe if he had more sleep he would have scored three or four goals today.\" The manager will meet his player on Sunday . Balotelli has already broken a curfew this season, having been spotted in a Manchester restaurant late at night less than 48 hours before the December loss at Chelsea. The decision to deploy Balotelli against Bolton was perhaps made easier by the fact Sergio Ag\u00fcero was deemed unable to start after playing for Argentina in midweek. The influential David Silva was also rested. The last time City started without that pair \u2013 against Sunderland on New Year's Day \u2013 they lost 1-0, but Bolton never looked capable of inflicting such a setback here. City threatened to blow away Wanderers from the start. Samir Nasri had a close-range shot blocked in the first minute even before the Balotelli misses began. The Italian was first put through in the third minute by a fine ball from Yaya Tour\u00e9, who revelled in the advanced role usually assigned to Silva. From an acute angle, Balotelli struck a shot off the post and Nasri fired the follow-up straight at goalkeeper Adam Bogdan from eight yards out. One minute later, Yaya Tour\u00e9 romped through the Bolton defence to tee up Balotelli again, but this time the striker shot wide from six yards. David Pizarro, the on-loan Chilean making his full debut for the club, put Balotelli through for another opportunity in the 12th minute. The striker had time to slip and get back up before booming a shot over. A goal was inevitable, but the source of the shot was a shock. Clichy, with one goal in professional football, found the net in the 23rd minute, albeit with the help of a deflection off Gretar Steinsson, which took the Frenchman's strike from 25 yards out beyond the keeper. City lapsed into complacency after that and allowed Bolton a few shots on goal, the most dangerous coming in the 36th minute, when Joe Hart had to tip Ryo Miyaichi's low effort wide. The hosts reasserted themselves before the break and created several more chances, most of them falling to Balotelli. One shot on the turn from the Italian forced a fine save from Bogdan. The second half was barely under way when a clever pass from Gareth Barry put Balotelli through for another duel with the goalkeeper. Again Bogdan won, pushing away the striker's tame finish. By contrast, Bogdan got nowhere near a long-range blast by Kolo Tour\u00e9 a moment later and was relieved to see it whizz narrowly wide. In a bid to kill off the game, Mancini switched to a two-striker formation in the 62nd minute, introducing Edin Dzeko for Pizarro. The ball was almost immediately put in the Bolton net \u2013 but by a Bolton player, Darren Pratley almost scoring a spectacular own goal by poking the ball off Dzeko's foot and on to his own crossbar from 20 yards out. In the 69th minute, Balotelli finally found the net. Adam Johnson dodged between Zat Knight and Sam Ricketts before producing a fine backheeled cross from the byline, whereupon Balotelli showed his goal instinct was intact after all by beating the defenders to the ball and tapping it into the net. Game over. The title race, however, is far from over and Mancini expects it to become tighter later on Sunday at White Hart Lane. \"I think United will win because they are a strong team. If we want to win the championship we need to win the next 10 games.\"",

This defeat from a late Gareth McAuley winner may already be causing the coffin to be lined and the pallbearers put on stand-by. West Bromwich Albion dominated this game, especially after the break, and it may now be a question of when, rather than if, Roman Abramovich decides the time has come for AVB to hear the executioner's song. Chelsea had won every one of their 11 previous Premier League encounters with Albion. The last occasion West Brom enjoyed a victory over them was on New Year's Day 1984, in a League Cup fixture. You have to leaf further back in the annals, nearly 33 years ago to the day, to find the previous time Chelsea went down in the league to the West Midlands club when Danny Blanchflower was the London side's manager and West Brom won 1-0 here in the old First Division. The defensive chaos that has become so familiar to Blues watchers this season continued with only the excellent Ashley Cole excused and David Luiz once more the chief culprit in a display peppered by the misjudgment that suggests he is liable to always be found out at this level. For the goal that may come to be known as the one that consigned Villas-Boas to an embarrassing footnote in Chelsea's history, his rearguard failed to clear a Keith Andrews cross from the left: when the ball broke to McAuley he smashed home. Chelsea had been unchanged from the side who beat Bolton Wanderers 3-0 at Stamford Bridge last weekend. This meant Frank Lampard continued in the starting XI and as captain \u2013 in John Terry's absence \u2013 despite the midfielder's strained relationship with Villas-Boas, whose latest lesson in man-management came on Friday when he informed his squad that they were, in case they thought otherwise, inferior to Manchester City's. As if to emphasise that his manager was talking straight it was Lampard who made the first error, giving away possession and allowing the home side to initiate the first of what would be numerous attacks. When they poured forward, which was often, Albion posed Chelsea too many awkward questions for a side supposedly among the elite of the division. The unit of Peter Odemwingie, James Morrison, Jerome Thomas and Marc-Antoine Fortun\u00e9 continually pushed on to the Chelsea backline and might have scored many times. One illustration came when Odemwingie found Thomas, who found Morrison who, with the outside of sweet right boot, forced Petr Cech to rise and make a fine fingertip save to his left. As with England in midweek, Daniel Sturridge was the brightest light in the Chelsea attack, though he would be replaced later. A flipped ball from his right-hand berth found Juan Mata who, with his favoured left boot, should not have sliced the finish. After 14 minutes a Ramires-Michael Essien-Didier Drogba move ended with Mata this time forcing a sharp save from Ben Foster, who impressed all afternoon. From the corner, Essien's shot was blocked. Chelsea's best chance of the period fell to Sturridge. Drogba, dropping deep, swept a sweet ball from the right-hand corridor to his striking partner but after a neat first touch Sturridge's attempt went wide of Foster's left post. To prosper and relieve the incessant pressure on their manager, Chelsea needed to score during this passage. They pressed but could not find that moment where belief meets execution to provide the killer touch. Gary Cahill had a goal-bound effort from a Lampard corner blocked, and when Youssouf Mulumbu's mazy run took him into the Chelsea area he might have opened the scoring. This time Cahill provided the deflection. Sturridge is yet to offer the consistent dazzling end product of a premier performer. After the break, Mata profited from Steven Reid's inability to intercept near halfway when the defender went down unmolested and injured, and subsequently had to be replaced. The Spaniard looked up before expertly finding the space between Sturridge and the on-rushing Foster. But the forward, in attempting a dummy reminiscent of Pel\u00e9's for Brazil at the 1970 World Cup, took not just the keeper but himself out of the equation. As he ran to retrieve the ball it spun away to safety. This got Sturridge taken off in favour of Florent Malouda but West Brom took hold of the game and the artillery rained in on Cech's goal. The latest trademark error from David Luiz \u2013 he should have hoofed the ball to safety along his left touchline \u2013 allowed Fortun\u00e9 to collect, and he ran at Cech before his shot forced a corner from the keeper's save. Moments later, a further defensive mix-up again took the ball to Fortun\u00e9 and from 25 yards he unloaded a piledriver that Cech again beat away. Cole, scurrying back desperately, was next up to save his side, narrowly getting a desperate boot in ahead of the substitute Chris Brunt to clear danger from an incoming cross from the left. Earlier in the day Arsenal had travelled to Anfield to collect a vital 2-1 win over Liverpool that left Chelsea requiring the win here to draw back alongside their rivals. McAuley's finish ended those hopes. It also raises the spectre of the club failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since Abramovich became owner in 2003. And, it could yet end the employment \u2013 and agony \u2013 of Villas-Boas by the trigger-happy Russian.",

      "bodyText": "Roberto Mart\u00ednez's selection decisions were publicly called into question by the Wigan owner, Dave Whelan, after their six-month run without a home win was extended by an enterprising display from Swansea. Although Whelan, who effectively bankrolls the club, insisted his manager's position was not under threat, he will demand a meeting on Monday morning. The focus of Whelan's dissatisfaction was the presence of Victor Moses, Hugo Rodallega and Mohamed Diam\u00e9 on the bench for a match that bottom-placed Wigan desperately needed to win. Defeat, courtesy of two long-distance goals from Gylfi Sigurdsson, left Wigan two points shy of safety with 11 matches remaining. \"That was our worst performance in four or five years and I will be having a meeting with Roberto on Monday to ask him some questions about the performance and the selection,\" said Whelan. \"There were three quality players on the bench and I want to know why. Roberto's future is secure. He has done a great job for the club, but I want a meeting so he can put his cards on the table, and I will put my cards on the table too.\" Mart\u00ednez can expect a reciprocation of the loyalty he showed when turning down an approach from Aston Villa last June. However, he has overseen only four victories across all competitions since then and his frustration at the final whistle was compounded both by the defeat coming against his former club, and the fact that eight of his players had been away on international duty in the buildup. The 21-year-old Moses, he revealed, had not returned from Rwanda, where he made his debut for Nigeria, until Friday. \"It was an impossible week for us,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"To counter their passing game you have to be very, very fit, and we could not reach that tempo. You need a full tank, and after so many long flights our tank was nowhere near full.\" A quarter of Wigan's points this season were garnered from their three August fixtures against newly promoted teams. So this fixture and next Saturday's trip to Norwich represented potential bounty in their relegation fight. However, they were picked off by Sigurdsson's stunning double within nine minutes either side of the interval. Rather than dwell on being denied an opening goal by James McCarthy's sliding clearance off the line, after Scott Sinclair had glided around the goalkeeper Ali al-Habsi, the visitors continued to create chances, and took the lead in first-half injury time. Steven Caulker threaded a pass to Sigurdsson 20 yards out, the ball was transferred from left boot to right, and Habsi groped at thin air. The Icelandic international, signed on loan from the German club Hoffenheim in January, planted another in the top corner nine minutes after the restart when Moses, on as a substitute, tripped Nathan Dyer. The quality of the free-kick left Al-Habsi motionless. \"That was his trademark, really,\" said the Swansea manager, Brendan Rodgers. \"He has tremendous dip on the ball. He is here to create and score goals and he does that masterfully. \"Gylfi's instinct is to attack and in this league when goals are so hard to come by you need those qualities. Possession is no good on its own, you have to have penetration and Gylfi gives us that.\" Swansea enjoyed less possession after winger Nathan Dyer's dismissal on the hour, for a foul on Jordi G\u00f3mez as both players skirmished for possession. \"There was no malicious intent or force in it but when your foot is in the air and your studs are showing you can get sent off, and the referee was in a very good position,\" said Rodgers, who will nevertheless review the decision.",

      "bodyText": "A pioneering project to put Dartmoor's wild ponies on the pill is to begin in Devon later this year. Concerns has been growing for several years about overbreeding among the semi-feral animals, high numbers of which have ended up in horse sanctuaries or slaughtered and the meat sold overseas as their market value has plummeted. The recession has further affected sales of the ponies, with fewer people prepared to take on and train up a half-wild animal, despite their temperaments and intelligence making them ideal as children's riding ponies. Now vets working for World Horse Welfare have been given the go-ahead to bring in injection from Australia to control the numbers of foals being born on the moor. WHW veterinary consultant Keith Meldrum has been working closely with the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) and the pharmaceutical company Pfizer on proposed plans to provide a group of 20 mares with a contraceptive injection. \"A project of this kind has never been carried out before in the UK and I am delighted to be a part of it,\" he said. \"We are hoping that, if successful, this could become a long-term solution to the issue of overbreeding within Britain's semi-feral horse and pony populations.\" Meldrum said the treatment was not as invasive as sterilising the mares. \"We feel that this method of control is advantageous as the mares can come back into foal after the treatment; its simply means there is simply a reduction in foal production for the duration of the project. We are close to starting the initial injections now that we have the [drug] in our possession and after the Veterinary Medicines Directorate gave us the go ahead for batches to be imported from Australia into the UK.\" There are thought to be fewer than 1,000 of the ponies left on the moor, down from an estimated 25,000 in the 1930s. In late spring a team led by Meldrum plan to round up ponies into a holding area where they will be micro-chipped and marked in a way in which they are identifiable at a distance. They will then be given an injection, and four weeks later given a second dose. After a six-month period the mares will be blood-tested to see if their oestrus levels have been suppressed owing to the injection. If the mares respond positively after the initial six months, then they will receive a further does which will last until spring 2013. The secretary of the DHPA, Charlotte Faulkner said: 'The adult pony numbers on the moor need to be maintained at its present number for the benefit of Dartmoor, but the number of foals need to be reduced as there is no market for them at the moment. \"Controlling the production of unwanted foals will ensure the ponies' welfare. We are optimistic that this project will help us to ensure the future of ponies on Dartmoor, grazing to keep it as we know and love it for generations to come, creating the habitat for its wonderful birds, plants and animals to be conserved.\" The project is being sponsored by Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Pony.",

      "bodyText": "Conservative rivals of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appear on course to gain firm control of the Iranian parliament, according to early election results. In a huge embarrassment to the president, his younger sister Parvin Ahmadinejad was defeated by a conservative rival in their hometown of Garmsar. Of 197 winners declared by midday Saturday, at least 102 were conservatives who turned against Ahmadinejad after he openly challenged the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Among the prominent anti-Ahmadinejad victors were Gholam Ali Haddad Adel, whose daughter is married to Khamenei's son, and parliament speaker Ali Larijani, Iran's former nuclear negotiator. Six independent candidates opposed to the president have also been elected so far. The remaining seats were split between Ahmadinejad supporters and centrists. At least 15 races will have to be decided in runoffs. The results indicate Ahmadinejad may face a more hostile parliament in his final 18 months in office and give the ruling clerics a clear path to ensure his successor is a Khamenei loyalist. The conservatives' lead was expected as the elections boiled down to a contest between conservatives supporting and opposing Ahmadinejad. Reformists were virtually absent from the ballot, showing the crushing force of crackdowns on the opposition. Instead, Friday's elections became a referendum on Ahmadinejad's political stature after he tried to challenge the near-total authority of Khamenei to decide critical government policies such as intelligence and foreign affairs. The apparent setbacks for Ahmadinejad's backers, according to early results, could signal a decisive blow in the internal political conflicts and give hard-liners an even stronger say over Iran's nuclear programme. \"It appears that the era of 'Ahmadinejadism' in Iran's political history is gradually coming to an end,\" said Davoud Hermidas Bavand, a Tehran-based political analyst. Khamenei said on Friday that Iran was moving into a \"sensitive period\" in the confrontation over Tehran's nuclear programme, which Iran claims is peaceful but the US and its allies fear could lead to atomic weapons. The US president, Barack Obama, is scheduled to hold talks on Monday at the White House with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who is seeking US backing for a possible military action against Iran, but has signalled that Israel is ready to go alone. In advance of the meeting, Obama stepped up his warnings that it was \"unacceptable\" for Iran to become a nuclear-armed state. Yet even before all the final election result, which is expected at the earliest on Sunday, some Iranian officials were calling for a tougher response to the growing international pressure on the Islamic regime. \"Under the present cold war we are in, this election will increase our national security. It will make the US and the west change its tone toward us,\" said Muhammad Reza Bahanor, a hardliner seeking re-election. He predicted that 80% of the new parliament will belong to a group known as the ultraconservative Motahed, or United Front, which is the main anti-Ahmadinejad group. Iran's opposition, crushed in recent years and banned from running in the elections, largely called for a countrywide boycott of the vote. The opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi were placed under house arrest in February 2011. Despite the boycott, reports from Iran suggested many people, especially those in small and conservative cities, participated in the vote. More than 48m Iranians are eligible to vote in the Majlis elections.",

      "bodyText": "Preamble P18 W18 D0 L0 F52 A7. That's Manchester City's home record in the league over the last 12 months, and they are approximately 100.000000 per cent certain to make it 19 wins in a row against Bolton this afternoon. It would/will also be their 14th consecutive home league victory this season, which would be a new English top-flight record. (City are currently equal with Newcastle, who won their first 13 games at the stadium formerly known as St James' Park in 1995-96.) All hail the Etihad Unstoppables, or some such rubbish name. City certainly need three points today, because this is their last really easy game for a while. Their next five league fixtures are Swansea (a), Chelsea (h), Stoke (a), Sunderland (h) and Arsenal (a). Today's 4-0 victory over Bolton is one of six 3pm fixtures, which involve clubs in all four divisions of the Premier League. Here they are, with predictions on which you are strongly advised not to stake your last Rolo. Blackburn 2-1 Aston Villa Manchester City 4-0 Bolton QPR 1-2 Everton Stoke 2-1 Norwich West Brom 1-1 Chelsea Wigan 0-2 Swansea Something to talk about today/do my job for me/open journalism/do my job for me For the last few months I've been begging The Man to allow me to write a Joy of Six on one-on-one finishes. When that glorious day comes, what should I include? These two are inked in: Kanu sitting the goalkeeper down, and Careca finishing with a smoothness that bordered on erotica. 2.08pm It's still 1-1 in an eventful game at Anfield, which has included a freak injury to Mikel Arteta. Liverpool have some played some excellent stuff and should probably be out of sight. You can follow the rest of the game with Scott Murray. 2.15pm DEAR SANTA I WANT ONE OF THESE NOW PLEASE. Man City v Bolton team news Mario Balotelli starts despite being pictured in an entirely sober state outside a legal establishment \"36 hours before the game\".

Subs: Tremmel, Tate, Routledge, Monk, McEachran, Moore, Gower. Referee: Andre Marriner (W Midlands) 2.34pm \" Martin gets his hose out?\" Eh? Either way, Martin Keown is now the first footballer to appear on the cover of Time Magazine and have a Football Focus appearance interrupted by a fire alarm. 2.36pm Robin van Persie has just put Arsenal 2-1 ahead in injury time at Anfield with a wonderful sidefooted volley. Scott Murray has more. West Brom v Chelsea team news Frank plays. West Brom: Foster, Reid, McAuley, Olsson, Ridgewell, Andrews, Mulumbu, Morrison, Odemwingie, Fortune, Thomas. Subs: Fulop, Long, Brunt, Dorrans, Shorey, Tamas, Cox. Chelsea: Cech, Ivanovic, Luiz, Cahill, Cole, Ramires, Essien, Lampard, Sturridge, Drogba, Mata. Subs: Turnbull, Romeu, Torres, Mikel, Malouda, Meireles, Hutchinson. Referee: Phil Dowd (Staffordshire) 2.43pm Kalle Weis-Fogh has suggested this for the list of great one-on-ones. Lovely goal and all, but a blatant rip-off of Kanu's finish. Bit like how the Pixies ripped off Nirvana. 2.45pm Arsenal have won 2-1 at Anfield, with Robin van Persie's injury-time winner a thing of rare technical beauty. What are Arsenal going to do without him? They can fall off that bridge when they come to it. For now they can celebrate moving to within just four points of Spurs. Spurs have their best team for 25 years, Arsenal their worst for nearly 20. Surely Spurs couldn't Spurs this and finish below Arsenal, couldn't they? 2.59pm \"Hi Rob, I'm at WBA v CFC,\" says muy colleague Jamie Jackson, \"and the word is that if CFC go down AVB might be hearin a verse or three of the executioner's song. Then, again, this is Chelsea, so he might not...\" And the whole darned Chelsea comedy keeps perpetuating itself. Roman Abramovic will never settle on one manager, will he? 3pm It's all kicking off. 3.03pm Mario Balotelli has hit the post for Manchester City against Bolton, with Adam Bogdan brilliantly saving Samir Nasri's follow up. At Loftus Road, Tim Cahill has hit the bar for Everton with a long-range blooter. 3.05pm \"A speech jammer for Christmas?\" says Paul Szabo. \"Why wait? It would make a doozy of a wedding present.\" 3.06pm Manchester City take a 3-0 moral lead against Bolton, with someone \u2013 I didn't hear who it was \u2013 missing a great chance. On the scoreboard it's still 0-0, but not, you suspect, for long. Can I revise that 4-0 prediction? 3.07pm \"Maybe you only came about listening to The Pixies after it was featured in that movie Fight Club but Kurt Cobain himself said Nirvana owed a great debt to bands like The Pixies...without which Nirvana never would have come in to being. Stick that in your collective pipe.\" That's Eoghan Hanrahan, emphatically getting the joke. 3.10pm West Brom are dominating Chelsea, according to Charlie Nicholas on Sky. ROY FOR ENGLAND. Odemwingie is apparently given Ashley Cole a bit of a chasing. \"Cole looks a bit slow,\" says a surprised Charlie Nicholas. History will, or at least should, record Cole as the most consistently excellent of the Golden Generation, but he is on his way down from the top of the hill, isn't he? 3.12pm \"This is a great one-on-one finish,\" says Phil Cowen. \"Berbatov having a bit of fun with a spinning ball. Casual.\" Berbarotica. 3.14pm \"Points of order: Pixies predated Nirvana,\" says Paul Griffin. \"Neither takes a definite article.\" I'll allow the second, as I used to get inordinately exasperated with talk of 'The Doves' back in the day. The first was obviously a lame joke. The clue was in the suggestion that Michael Laudrup had ripped off a goal scored 13 years in the future. 3.15pm Mario Balotelli misses a half-chance at the Etihad. It's interesting that City are so dominant at home these days (in the league at least) that they can absolutely batter weaker teams even without Aguero and Silva. In that respect they are benefitting from all the credit they have put in the bank in that run of 18 home wins in the last 12 months. Many teams now go there aiming for little more than an honourable defeat, and the whole darned thing perpetuates itself. 3.16pm Still no goals in the Premier League. Do they get paid for this? 3.19pm \"I didn't enter the 'Who wants to be an MBMer?'competition because I looked at the question and said to myself, \"Exactly. What kind of a fool would want to do that (putting aside, for the moment, the dizzying paychecks and the casual death threats)?'\" says Mac Millings. \"Other that that, I'm all for this open journalism thing. I don't actually read the SportBlog because, well, y'know, but I assume that the new model has brought a sharp decrease in 'do you actually get paid for this rubbish?' comments, and if it hasn't also cut down the number of posts that say 'I expect better from the Guardian', don't worry \u2013 it will soon.\" I love the Sportblog. I think of it as a kind of professional puberty, with all the exhilarating self-discovery that suggests. 3.21pm Can one of you footballer types bother a net, please? 3.23pm At Loftus Road, the excellent Tim Howard makes a fine save from \u00c1kos Buzs\u00e1ky's curling free kick. I know this, because Paul Merson knows this. 3.24pm \"If you do end up producing that Joy of Six it'll be pretty easy,\" says Owen Thorpe. \"Just show this one then head to the pub. Nothing else will ever come close...\" That is wonderful, although it's a bit of a genre bender. I think of it as a great first touch first, and a great one-on-one finish second, if that makes sense. It doesn't make sense. 3.24pm: Manchester City 1-0 Bolton (Steinsson own goal 23); Blackburn 0-1 Aston Villa (N'Zogbia 24) At the Etihad, Gael Clichy's shot deflected takes a big decisive deflection off Gretar Steinsson; at Ewood Park, the talented, feckless Charles Insomnia has given Villa a deserved lead with a beautiful strike. 3.27pm So, congratulations to Manchester City, who move five points clear at the top of the table and make it 19 consecutive home wins in the Premier League. 3.29pm \"Oh Rob what have you done!\" says Alex Hanton. \"Presumably you're used to dealing with the comparatively mild football pedant but now you've started attracting the famously humourless and puritan music pedants. Expect a lengthy email about the influence of Husker Du on the pixies early work any second now [it definitely won't be from me because I'm better than that probably].\" 3.30pm Jordan Rhodes has only scored twice in the first half hour of Huddersfield's game at Bury. They lead 3-0 and Rhodes has 30 in 28 games this season. I wonder what Roy Keane, who let him leave Ipswich, makes it of all. Triggs probably winces every time he says GOAL! Rhodes on the TV screen. 3.32pm: QPR 0-1 Everton (Drenthe 31) A long-range screamer from the mohican-sporting Royston Drenthe has put in-form Everton ahead at Loftus Road. 3.33pm \"Got to be a shoo-in for the Joy of Six,\" says D Bartlett. Ah yes, a splendid suggestion. For two weeks in the summer of 1996, young, impressionable, delicate aesthetes up and England fell madly in love with Davor Suker. All 12 of them. The rest were busy shouting INGERLUND and beating up foreigners. 3.36pm: QPR 1-1 Everton (Zamora 35) QPR are level at Loftus Road. Bobby Zamora heads Busz\u00e1ky's free-kick through Tim Howard and into the net. 3.38pm A mistake from Kolo Toure \u2013 imagine \u2013 gives Ryo Miyaichi a great chance to equalise at the Etihad Stadium. He sets a curler towards the far corner, and Joe Hart makes a brilliant one-handed save. Toure, by the way, came on for the injured Zabaleta after 20 minutes. 3.39pm \"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news Rob,\" says Chris Gannon, \"but Triggs is dead.\" We had this discussion* the other week, and couldn't find conclusive proof either way. Can somebody who lives near Roy Keane give him a knock and ask him? * 'Discussion' is a rather grandiose term for someone saying \"Is Triggs dead?\" and another person replying \"Dunno\". 3.40pm West Brom are still dominating Chelsea at the Hawthorns, although Ben Foster has just made a decent save from Michael Essien's long-range curler. 3.42pm \"Having heard the teams and the first five minutes of Manchester City vs Bolton Wanderers,\" begins Gary Naylor. \"I was reminded of Spitting Image's sketch that pitted Henry Cooper against Julian Lloyd Webber commentated by a breathless Harry Carpenter. It appears to be unavailable on YouTube, which is a shame.\" The top teams have certainly become more dominant at home in the Premier League era. 3.43m Paul Merson is flapping his gums giddily in the Sky Soccer Saturday studio. \"That's the worst I've ever seen!\" he says. Eventually he tells us that \u00c1kos Buzs\u00e1ky has hit the post from four yards, a few seconds after Adel Taarabt hit the post from distance. Buszaky's miss will be coming to a Rory McGrath DVD soon. 3.46pm \"OOOOOOOOOOAAAGHHHHHHHH!\" cries Phil Thompson after Bolton's Adam Bogdan makes a wonderful save to deny Mario Balotelli. City could be 7-1 ahead. 3.48pm \"Re: your entry at 3.33pm, they largely refrained from beating up foreigners in Summer 1996,\" says Gary Naylor, \"although they did trash a few foreign cars \u2013 they really were that stupid.\" And a Russian chap was stabbed to death for being a foreigner in a public place in the immediate aftermath of the defeat to Germany. 3.49pm: Wigan 0-1 Swansea (Sigurdsson 45) A gorgeous, dipping strike from Gylfi Sigurdsson has given Swansea the lead on the stroke of half-time. 3.50pm These are the half-time scores, then. Blackburn 0-1 Aston Villa Manchester City 1-0 Bogdan QPR 1-1 Everton Stoke 0-0 Norwich West Brom 0-0 Chelsea Wigan 0-1 Swansea 3.51pm If the scores stay as they are, there will be a whopping ten-point gap between Villa in 15th and QPR in 16th. More than ever, the Premier League is comprised of four mini-leagues: those who can win it, those who can finish fourth, those who are happy with mid-table mediocrity, and those who would throw the family pet under a bus to finish 17th. 4.01pm \"I cannot believe you have not mentioned the squirrel on the pitch at Loftus Road,\" says Marek Miernik. \"Biased reporting.\" And the worst thing is that I do get paid for this. 4.02pm Adam Bogdan has made yet another excellent save from Mario Balotelli. 4.05pm \"Rumours of Triggs' demise have been greatly exaggerated,\" says Marc Kaveh. \"In fact he has an autobiography due out in June!\" I'd give every last penny to see the reaction if Adrian Chiles asked Keane for his thoughts on this. 4.07pm Who needs the Log Lady from Twin Peaks when you can have the Log Dog? \"My Dad was out for a long bike ride before Christmas and headed off down a lane marked 'no cycling',\" says George Solomon, and you know where this is going, don't you. \"There was a bloke coming along with two dogs, one of which had an absolutely huge log in its mouth, and my Dad felt a little guilty about biking down the lane, so snuck through as quickly as he could. He looked up at the last second to mutter a quick apology and who should he find staring back at him with a seriously menacing stare? Keano of course. Couldn't confirm or deny if one of the dogs was Triggs though.\" 4.09pm Charlie Nicholas says Frank Lampard hasn't really been involved in the game at the Hawthorns. AVB out! 4.10pm If you like cocksure one-on-one finishes, this is 334 seconds of the purest porn. Actually I'm not sure there's been a better one-on-one finsiher, certainly in my fitba-watching lifetime, than him. 4.12pm No second-half goals in the Premier League so far. 4.13pm \"Speaking of Romario and finishing,\" says Alex Netherton, \"look at Michael Laudrup and passing.\" 4.14pm Daniel Sturridge \"is in, he's got to score,\" says Charlie Nicholas. You don't need me to tell you what happens next. 4.15pm: Wigan 0-2 Swansea (Sigurdsson 54) This has been coming, and it's another scorcher from Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson. That was such a smart piece of business from Brendan Rodgers. Why is nobody talking about him for the Chelsea job when Foreign Man is stabbed in the back? 4.17pm \"If Romario isn't in your Joy of Six, Rob, I'll be very disappointed,\" said Adam, approximately 1.1 second before I eulogised the same man. \"There has never been a greater one-on-one finisher than him. His turn of pace, control and coolness under such high pressure was always marvellous to watch, even if it was against your own team.\" Yep, and he loved the opportunity to vaccinate opponents. He didn't just want to score, he wanted to goad the opposing keeper in doing so. 4.18pm \"Just to confirm, in case any MBM readers were worried by the absence of updates; absolutely NOTHING worth mentioning is happening in the Stoke - Norwich game,\" says Nick Parker. I bet that's a game for the delicate aesthetes. 4.19pm These are the latest Premier League scores: Blackburn 0-1 Aston Villa Manchester City 1-0 Bogdan QPR 1-1 Everton Stoke 0-0 Norwich West Brom 0-0 Chelsea Wigan 0-2 Swansea 4.20pm \"Love this Raul one,\" says Will Hardy, \"as he had half the pitch to play with and still wanted to go round the keeper.\" 4.22pm Swansea's Nathan Dyer has been sent off for a tackle on Wigan's Jordi Gomez. On Sky, Chris Kamara is not happy, describing it as ridiculous. 4.23pm Bolton's Darren Pratley hits his own crossbar from 25 yards \u2013 a similar incident to this, presumably. 4.25pm \"After providing you with a relatively humorous Roy Keane story, I want some predictions Rob, predictions I tell you,\" says George Solomon. \"So, who's going down? Is this the final nail in Wigan's coffin today? Being outfootballed by a very similar team to themselves.\" Wigan. Blackburn. Bolton. Maybe. Of the Relegation Five, I don't think QPR will go down. 4.26pm \"This has got to go in,\" says Jonathan Siu. \"Has anyone ever bought a dummy so convincingly?\" 4.27pm: Manchester City 2-0 Bolton (Balotelli 69) \"GO-GO-GOALLLLLL!\" shrieks Phil Thompson, who then informs us that Bario Malotelli has finally converted one of his many chances. City are going to go five points clear, though you knew that this morning. 4.28pm \"Ooh, some subs from Pulis. Maybe time for plan B,\" says Peter Harmer. \"Bring on his skilful gnat-like midfield schemers I imagin... no \u2013 Jones and Jerome.\" In fairness, Pulis did try to purify Stoke's football. Well, okay, he bought Tuncay and Gudjohnsen and put them on the bench. It was a bit like someone buying a suit a size too small and swearing they'd fit into it, then realising they couldn't be bothered to lose the necessary weight. 4.30pm: Stoke 1-0 Norwich (Etherington 72) Anyway, Stoke's methodology isn't doing them any hard, and Matthew Etherington has just lashed them into the lead. 4.31pm \"When random eejits on the internet don't get the most basic of jokes, c'est, after all, rien de grave,\" says Phil Podolsky. \"But when it happens IRL, with a totally keut girl, man, it sucks. She then feels that the joke's on her, and not entirely without the reason, though obviously it's the last thing you want to communicate. The idea that irony doesn't have to come at the expense of someone else is too avant-garde for society yet.\" 4.33pm \"Amid night time warbling while watching Escape to Victory, a uni friend insisted this man was the greatest one-on-one finisher of all time,\" says Ben Dunn. \" However, he also stated that he could see Bill Werbeniuk wearing a brown adidas tracksuit in the large crowd scene at the end.\" 4.33pm QPR are on top against Everton; West Brom are on top against Chelsea. The Premier League is so damn competitive right now. Fernando Torres is about to come on for Chelsea. 4.35pm \"Not the prettiest Rob,\" begins Harvey Parkes, \"but if you end up doing a JoS of one on ones, and I see nothing of Jean Pierre Papin, good Lord there'll be a to do.\" There are some gems in here, the ugly beauty of which is somehow enhanced by that classic kit. 4.36pm Bolton are tantalisingly close to securing an honourable 2-0 defeat at the Etihad. Can they hold on? These are the latest scores: Blackburn 0-1 Aston Villa Manchester City 2-0 Boltan QPR 1-1 Everton Stoke 1-0 Norwich West Brom 0-0 Chelsea Wigan 0-2 Swansea 4.37pm \"I was one of those delicate, Suker-loving aesthetes,\" says Mac Millings. \"Counter-attack, first touch, and almost a one-on-one \u2013 this is one of my favourite finishes ever.\" 4.38pm \"The participation of Cesc Fabregas in the build-up has obscured for many that this is one of the most preposterously brilliant executions ever seen, from both Messi and Iniesta,\" says Phil Podolsky. Yes, that was a crazily good goal. It's actually even better than it looks, which is a fair achievement given that it looks like Zooey Deschanel. 4.41pm: West Brom 1-0 Chelsea (McAuley 82) Foreign man out! West Brom have taken a deserved lead against Chelsea. It came from a half-cleared set piece; eventually Liam Ridgewell scuffed a volley across the face of goal, and it was tapped in from a few yards by Gareth McAuley. 4.43pm: Blackburn 1-1 Aston Villa (Dunn 85) David Dunn has scored a vital equaliser at Ewood Park, heading in Bradley Orr's superb cross. 4.44pm \"Wasn't the best ever one-on-one finish actually an er... miss?\" says Gary Naylor. That's a great point, one that I'll be sure to nick cite in the JOS. Mind you, tell it to Jesper Blomqvist. 4.45pm \"Correct me but didn't Davor Suker always check the pulse in his neck before kicking a penalty?\" says Simon Frank. \"It was such a fey, yet sinister thing to do. Loved it.\" Really? If that's true it's my new favourite football detail, moving ahead of Preben Elkjaer and his half-time tabs. 4.47pm It sounds like Chelsea have been well beaten by West Brom. \"They're playing like they're blindfolded,\" says Charlie Nicholas. They are in a complete mess. Clearly Villas-Boas is on the way out, but I have a lot of sympathy for him. That dressing-room became too powerful, so powerful that they can almost bully managers into unemployment. I can't think of such an intimidating dressing-room in English football since Don Revie's Leeds. 4.50pm A victory of sorts for both sides at the Etihad, where it has finished Manchester City 2-0 Bolton. City have won 19 home games in a row, which definitely equals the Premier League record, and 14 in a row from the start of the season, which I think is an all-time record for the English top flight. 4.51pm Frank Lampard misses a great chance to equalise from Ashley Cole's cross. AVB out! 4.52pm It has finished Stoke 1-0 Bolton , Blackburn 1-1 Aston Villa and QPR 1-1 Everton. 4.54pm Petr Cech comes forward for a Chelsea free-kick... but nothing happens and it's all over at the Hawthorns. It finishes West Brom 1-0 Chelsea, a deserved and memorable victory for the excellent Roy Hodgson. Andre Villas-Boas will probably be a significantly richer man in a few days' time. 4.56pm The final whistle has gone at the Dave Whelan Emporium, where it finished Wigan 0-2 Swansea. That it's, I think, for a fairly quiet afternoon of Premier League football, the West Brom result excepted. Ta for your emails. These were the final scores: Blackburn 1-1 Aston Villa Manchester City 2-0 Bolton QPR 1-1 Everton Stoke 1-0 Norwich West Brom 1-0 Chelsea Wigan 0-2 Swansea",

That's Manchester City's home record in the league over the last 12 months, and they are approximately 100.000000 per cent certain to make it 19 wins in a row against Bolton this afternoon. It would/will also be their 14th consecutive home league victory this season, which would be a new English top-flight record. (City are currently equal with Newcastle, who <a href=\"http://www.statto.com/football/teams/newcastle-united/1995-1996/table/1996-03-03\">won their first 13 games</a> at the stadium formerly known as St James' Park in 1995-96.) All hail the Etihad Unstoppables, or some such rubbish name.</p> <p>City certainly need three points today, because this is their last really easy game for a while. Their next five league fixtures are Swansea (a), Chelsea (h), Stoke (a), Sunderland (h) and Arsenal (a). Today's 4-0 victory over Bolton is one of six 3pm fixtures, which involve clubs in all four divisions of the Premier League. Here they are, with predictions on which you are strongly advised not to stake your last Rolo.</p> <blockquote> <p>Blackburn 2-1 Aston Villa<br>Manchester City 4-0 Bolton<br>QPR 1-2 Everton<br>Stoke 2-1 Norwich<br>West Brom 1-1 Chelsea<br>Wigan 0-2 Swansea</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Something to talk about today/do my job for me/open journalism/do my job for me</strong> For the last few months I've been begging The Man to allow me to write a Joy of Six on one-on-one finishes.

Lovely goal and all, but a blatant rip-off of Kanu's finish. Bit like how the Pixies ripped off Nirvana.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2.45pm</strong> Arsenal have won 2-1 at Anfield, with Robin van Persie's injury-time winner a thing of rare technical beauty. What are Arsenal going to do without him? They can fall off that bridge when they come to it. For now they can celebrate moving to within <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premier-league-2011-12/tables\">just four points of Spurs</a>. Spurs have their best team for 25 years, Arsenal their worst for nearly 20. Surely Spurs couldn't Spurs this and finish below Arsenal, couldn't they?</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>2.59pm</strong> \"Hi Rob, I'm at WBA v CFC,\" says muy colleague Jamie Jackson, \"and the word is that if CFC go down AVB might be hearin a verse or three of the executioner's song. Then, again, this is Chelsea, so he might not...\" And the whole darned Chelsea comedy keeps perpetuating itself. Roman Abramovic will never settle on one manager, will he?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3pm</strong> It's all kicking off.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.03pm</strong> Mario Balotelli has hit the post for Manchester City against Bolton, with Adam Bogdan brilliantly saving Samir Nasri's follow up. At Loftus Road, Tim Cahill has hit the bar for Everton with a long-range blooter.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.05pm</strong> \"A speech jammer for Christmas?\" says Paul Szabo. \"Why wait? It would make a doozy of a wedding present.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.06pm</strong> Manchester City take a 3-0 moral lead against Bolton, with someone \u2013 I didn't hear who it was \u2013 missing a great chance. On the scoreboard it's still 0-0, but not, you suspect, for long. Can I revise that 4-0 prediction?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.07pm</strong> \"Maybe you only came about listening to The Pixies after it was featured in that movie Fight Club but Kurt Cobain himself said Nirvana owed a great debt to bands like The Pixies...without which Nirvana never would have come in to being. Stick that in your collective pipe.\" That's Eoghan Hanrahan, emphatically getting the joke.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.10pm</strong> West Brom are dominating Chelsea, according to Charlie Nicholas on Sky. ROY FOR ENGLAND. Odemwingie is apparently given Ashley Cole a bit of a chasing. \"Cole looks a bit slow,\" says a surprised Charlie Nicholas. History will, or at least should, record Cole as the most consistently excellent of the Golden Generation, but he is on his way down from the top of the hill, isn't he?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.12pm</strong> \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fy4tzNlSpI#t=1m20s\">This is a great one-on-one finish</a>,\" says Phil Cowen. \"Berbatov having a bit of fun with a spinning ball. Casual.\" Berbarotica.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.14pm</strong> \"Points of order: Pixies predated Nirvana,\" says Paul Griffin. \"Neither takes a definite article.\" I'll allow the second, as I used to get inordinately exasperated with talk of 'The Doves' back in the day. The first was obviously a lame joke. The clue was in the suggestion that Michael Laudrup had ripped off a goal scored 13 years in the future.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong> Mario Balotelli misses a half-chance at the Etihad. It's interesting that City are so dominant at home these days (in the league at least) that they can absolutely batter weaker teams even without Aguero and Silva. In that respect they are benefitting from all the credit they have put in the bank in that run of 18 home wins in the last 12 months. Many teams now go there aiming for little more than an honourable defeat, and the whole darned thing perpetuates itself.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.16pm</strong> Still no goals in the Premier League. Do they get paid for this?</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.19pm</strong> \"I didn't enter the 'Who wants to be an MBMer?'competition because I looked at the question and said to myself, \"Exactly. What kind of a fool would want to do that (putting aside, for the moment, the dizzying paychecks and the casual death threats)?'\" says Mac Millings. \"Other that that, I'm all for this open journalism thing. I don't actually read the SportBlog because, well, y'know, but I assume that the new model has brought a sharp decrease in 'do you actually get paid for this rubbish?' comments, and if it hasn't also cut down the number of posts that say 'I expect better from the Guardian', don't worry \u2013 it will soon.\" I love the Sportblog. I think of it as a kind of professional puberty, with all the exhilarating self-discovery that suggests.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.21pm</strong> Can one of you footballer types bother a net, please?</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.23pm</strong> At Loftus Road, the excellent Tim Howard makes a fine save from \u00c1kos Buzs\u00e1ky's curling free kick. I know this, because Paul Merson knows this.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.24pm</strong> \"If you do end up producing that Joy of Six it'll be pretty easy,\" says Owen Thorpe. \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_eSKHK9Fk\">Just show this one </a>then head to the pub. Nothing else will ever come close...\" That is wonderful, although it's a bit of a genre bender. I think of it as <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/11/joy-of-six-first-touches-bergkamp\">a great first touch</a> first, and a great one-on-one finish second, if that makes sense. It doesn't make sense.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.24pm: Manchester City 1-0 Bolton (Steinsson own goal 23); Blackburn 0-1 Aston Villa (N'Zogbia 24)</strong> At the Etihad, Gael Clichy's shot deflected takes a <strike> big </strike> decisive deflection off Gretar Steinsson; at Ewood Park, the talented, feckless Charles Insomnia has given Villa a deserved lead with a beautiful strike.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.27pm</strong> So, congratulations to Manchester City, who move five points clear at the top of the table and make it 19 consecutive home wins in the Premier League.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3.29pm</strong> \"Oh Rob what have you done!\" says Alex Hanton. \"Presumably you're used to dealing with the comparatively mild football pedant but now you've started attracting the famously humourless and puritan music pedants. Expect a lengthy email about the influence of Husker Du on the pixies early work any second now [it definitely won't be from me because I'm better than that probably].\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong> Jordan Rhodes has only scored twice in the first half hour of Huddersfield's game at Bury. They lead 3-0 and Rhodes has 30 in 28 games this season. I wonder what Roy Keane, who let him leave Ipswich, makes it of all. Triggs probably winces every time he says <strong>GOAL!</strong> Rhodes on the TV screen.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3.32pm: QPR 0-1 Everton (Drenthe 31)</strong> A long-range screamer from the mohican-sporting Royston Drenthe has put in-form Everton ahead at Loftus Road.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>3.33pm</strong> \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhN0bITB_ZA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\">Got to be a shoo-in for the Joy of Six</a>,\" says D Bartlett. Ah yes, a splendid suggestion. For two weeks in the summer of 1996, young, impressionable, delicate aesthetes up and England fell madly in love with Davor Suker. All 12 of them. The rest were busy shouting INGERLUND and beating up foreigners.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>3.36pm: QPR 1-1 Everton (Zamora 35)</strong> QPR are level at Loftus Road. Bobby Zamora heads Busz\u00e1ky's free-kick through Tim Howard and into the net.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>3.38pm</strong> A mistake from Kolo Toure \u2013 imagine \u2013 gives Ryo Miyaichi a great chance to equalise at the Etihad Stadium. He sets a curler towards the far corner, and Joe Hart makes a brilliant one-handed save. Toure, by the way, came on for the injured Zabaleta after 20 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>3.39pm</strong> \"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news Rob,\" says Chris Gannon, \"but Triggs is dead.\" We had this discussion* the other week, and couldn't find conclusive proof either way. Can somebody who lives near Roy Keane give him a knock and ask him?</p> <p><em>* 'Discussion' is a rather grandiose term for someone saying \"Is Triggs dead?\" and another person replying \"Dunno\". </em></p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>3.40pm</strong> West Brom are still dominating Chelsea at the Hawthorns, although Ben Foster has just made a decent save from Michael Essien's long-range curler.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>3.42pm</strong> \"Having heard the teams and the first five minutes of Manchester City vs Bolton Wanderers,\" begins Gary Naylor. \"I was reminded of Spitting Image's sketch that pitted Henry Cooper against Julian Lloyd Webber commentated by a breathless Harry Carpenter. It appears to be unavailable on YouTube, which is a shame.\" The top teams have certainly become more dominant at home in the Premier League era.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>3.43m</strong> Paul Merson is flapping his gums giddily in the Sky Soccer Saturday studio. \"That's the worst I've ever seen!\" he says. Eventually he tells us that \u00c1kos Buzs\u00e1ky has hit the post from four yards, a few seconds after Adel Taarabt hit the post from distance. Buszaky's miss will be coming to a Rory McGrath DVD soon.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>3.46pm</strong> \"OOOOOOOOOOAAAGHHHHHHHH!\" cries Phil Thompson after Bolton's Adam Bogdan makes a wonderful save to deny Mario Balotelli. City could be 7-1 ahead.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>3.48pm</strong> \"Re: your entry at 3.33pm, they largely refrained from beating up foreigners in Summer 1996,\" says Gary Naylor, \"although they did trash a few foreign cars \u2013 they really were that stupid.\" And a Russian chap was stabbed to death for being a foreigner in a public place in the immediate aftermath of the defeat to Germany.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>3.49pm: Wigan 0-1 Swansea (Sigurdsson 45)</strong> A gorgeous, dipping strike from Gylfi Sigurdsson has given Swansea the lead on the stroke of half-time.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>3.50pm</strong> These are the half-time scores, then.</p> <blockquote> <p>Blackburn 0-1 Aston Villa<br>Manchester City 1-0 Bogdan<br>QPR 1-1 Everton<br>Stoke 0-0 Norwich<br>West Brom 0-0 Chelsea<br>Wigan 0-1 Swansea</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>3.51pm</strong> If the scores stay as they are, there will be a whopping <a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/\">ten-point gap between Villa in 15th and QPR in 16th</a>. More than ever, the Premier League is comprised of four mini-leagues: those who can win it, those who can finish fourth, those who are happy with mid-table mediocrity, and those who would throw the family pet under a bus to finish 17th.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.01pm</strong> \"I cannot believe you have not mentioned the squirrel on the pitch at Loftus Road,\" says Marek Miernik. \"Biased reporting.\" And the worst thing is that I do get paid for this.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.02pm</strong> Adam Bogdan has made yet another excellent save from Mario Balotelli.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.05pm</strong> \"Rumours of Triggs' demise have been greatly exaggerated,\" says Marc Kaveh. \"In fact he <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/triggs-tale-why-my-life-with-roy-is-no-walk-in-the-park-2986595.html\">has an autobiography due out in June</a>!\" I'd give every last penny to see the reaction if Adrian Chiles asked Keane for his thoughts on this.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4.07pm</strong> Who needs the Log Lady from Twin Peaks when you can have the Log Dog? \"My Dad was out for a long bike ride before Christmas and headed off down a lane marked 'no cycling',\" says George Solomon, and you know where this is going, don't you. \"There was a bloke coming along with two dogs, one of which had an absolutely huge log in its mouth, and my Dad felt a little guilty about biking down the lane, so snuck through as quickly as he could. He looked up at the last second to mutter a quick apology and who should he find staring back at him with a seriously menacing stare? Keano of course. Couldn't confirm or deny if one of the dogs was Triggs though.\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>4.09pm</strong> Charlie Nicholas says Frank Lampard hasn't really been involved in the game at the Hawthorns. AVB out!</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>4.10pm</strong> If you like cocksure one-on-one finishes, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhjxcKqFfLc\">this is 334 seconds of the purest porn</a>.

Why is nobody talking about him for the Chelsea job when Foreign Man is stabbed in the back?</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>4.17pm</strong> \"If Romario isn't in your Joy of Six, Rob, I'll be very disappointed,\" said Adam, approximately 1.1 second before I eulogised the same man. \"There has never been a greater one-on-one finisher than him. His turn of pace, control and coolness under such high pressure was always marvellous to watch, even if it was against your own team.\" Yep, and he loved the opportunity to vaccinate opponents. He didn't just want to score, he wanted to goad the opposing keeper in doing so.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>4.18pm</strong> \"Just to confirm, in case any MBM readers were worried by the absence of updates; absolutely NOTHING worth mentioning is happening in the Stoke - Norwich game,\" says Nick Parker.

Well, okay, he bought Tuncay and Gudjohnsen and put them on the bench. It was a bit like someone buying a suit a size too small and swearing they'd fit into it, then realising they couldn't be bothered to lose the necessary weight.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>4.30pm: Stoke 1-0 Norwich (Etherington 72)</strong> Anyway, Stoke's methodology isn't doing them any hard, and Matthew Etherington has just lashed them into the lead.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>4.31pm</strong> \"When random eejits on the internet don't get the most basic of jokes, c'est, after all, rien de grave,\" says Phil Podolsky. \"But when it happens IRL, with a totally keut girl, man, it sucks. She then feels that the joke's on her, and not entirely without the reason, though obviously it's the last thing you want to communicate. The idea that irony doesn't have to come at the expense of someone else is too avant-garde for society yet.\"</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>4.33pm</strong> \"Amid night time warbling while watching Escape to Victory, a uni friend insisted <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdhTiRELppA\">this man was the greatest one-on-one finisher</a> of all time,\" says Ben Dunn. \" However, he also stated that he could see Bill Werbeniuk wearing a brown adidas tracksuit in the large crowd scene at the end.\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>4.33pm</strong> QPR are on top against Everton; West Brom are on top against Chelsea. The Premier League is so damn competitive right now. Fernando Torres is about to come on for Chelsea.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>4.35pm</strong> \"Not the prettiest Rob,\" begins Harvey Parkes, \"but if you end up doing a JoS of one on ones, and I see nothing of Jean Pierre Papin, good Lord there'll be a to do.\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZuRMrfVAV4\">There are some gems in here</a>, the ugly beauty of which is somehow enhanced by that classic kit.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>4.36pm</strong> Bolton are tantalisingly close to securing an honourable 2-0 defeat at the Etihad. Can they hold on? These are the latest scores:</p> <blockquote> <p>Blackburn 0-1 Aston Villa<br>Manchester City 2-0 Boltan<br>QPR 1-1 Everton<br>Stoke 1-0 Norwich<br>West Brom 0-0 Chelsea<br>Wigan 0-2 Swansea</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>4.37pm</strong> \"I was one of those delicate, Suker-loving aesthetes,\" says Mac Millings. \"Counter-attack, first touch, and almost a one-on-one \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miNhm0YOVYU\">this is one of my favourite finishes ever</a>.\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>4.38pm</strong> \"The participation of Cesc Fabregas in the build-up has obscured for many that this is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EW7R4Zh4FA\">one of the most preposterously brilliant executions ever seen</a>, from both Messi and Iniesta,\" says Phil Podolsky. Yes, that was a crazily good goal. It's actually even better than it looks, which is a fair achievement given that it looks like Zooey Deschanel.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>4.41pm: West Brom 1-0 Chelsea (McAuley 82)</strong> Foreign man out! West Brom have taken a deserved lead against Chelsea. It came from a half-cleared set piece; eventually Liam Ridgewell scuffed a volley across the face of goal, and it was tapped in from a few yards by Gareth McAuley.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.43pm: Blackburn 1-1 Aston Villa (Dunn 85)</strong> David Dunn has scored a vital equaliser at Ewood Park, heading in Bradley Orr's superb cross.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>4.44pm</strong> \"Wasn't the best ever one-on-one finish <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzRsvCsC4c\">actually an er... miss</a>?\" says Gary Naylor. That's a great point, one that I'll be sure to <strike> nick </strike> cite in the JOS. Mind you, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR4SxMBRH6U\">tell it to Jesper Blomqvist</a>.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4.45pm</strong> \"Correct me but didn't Davor Suker always check the pulse in his neck before kicking a penalty?\" says Simon Frank. \"It was such a fey, yet sinister thing to do. Loved it.\" Really? If that's true it's my new favourite football detail, moving ahead of Preben Elkjaer and his half-time tabs.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.47pm</strong> It sounds like Chelsea have been well beaten by West Brom. \"They're playing like they're blindfolded,\" says Charlie Nicholas. They are in a complete mess. Clearly Villas-Boas is on the way out, but I have a lot of sympathy for him. That dressing-room became too powerful, so powerful that they can almost bully managers into unemployment. I can't think of such an intimidating dressing-room in English football since Don Revie's Leeds.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.50pm</strong> A victory of sorts for both sides at the Etihad, where it has finished <strong>Manchester City 2-0 Bolton</strong>. City have won 19 home games in a row, which definitely equals the Premier League record, and 14 in a row from the start of the season, which I think is an all-time record for the English top flight.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.51pm</strong> Frank Lampard misses a great chance to equalise from Ashley Cole's cross. AVB out!</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>4.52pm</strong> It has finished <strong>Stoke 1-0 Bolton </strong>, <strong>Blackburn 1-1 Aston Villa</strong> and <strong>QPR 1-1 Everton</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.54pm</strong> Petr Cech comes forward for a Chelsea free-kick... but nothing happens and it's all over at the Hawthorns. It finishes <strong>West Brom 1-0 Chelsea</strong>, a deserved and memorable victory for the excellent Roy Hodgson. Andre Villas-Boas will probably be a significantly richer man in a few days' time.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>4.56pm</strong> The final whistle has gone at the Dave Whelan Emporium, where it finished Wigan 0-2 Swansea. That it's, I think, for a fairly quiet afternoon of Premier League football, the West Brom result excepted. Ta for your emails. These were the final scores:</p> <blockquote> <p>Blackburn 1-1 Aston Villa<br>Manchester City 2-0 Bolton<br>QPR 1-1 Everton<br>Stoke 1-0 Norwich<br>West Brom 1-0 Chelsea<br>Wigan 0-2 Swansea</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "Preamble: Afternoon all, and welcome to some live coverage of Andy Murray's attempt to beat Roger Federer to win the exotically named Dubai Duty Free Championship. Wouldn't it be nice if the trophy was a giant Toblerone. Murray was impressive yesterday against Djokovic having already played probably the best game of his life in losing against the Serb in the Australian Open semi-final. If Djokovic is now tennis's man to beat, then Murray must now have the belief he can beat him in tournaments that matter. He's been in fine form since linking up with Ivan Lendl - the ranting's down, the sulking's lessened and yesterday suggested his serve is on fire: he hit five aces, put 71% of his first serves in and won points on 85% of those. Or at least that's one way of looking at it. The other way is to put it this way: the reason Murray and Federer are competing in the final here is because Djokovic and Nadal care about minor tournaments like this and so don't play at their best. Certainly Djokovic wasn't as brilliant as he can be yesterday. Hence they can shrug off losses in these tournaments since its the majors they care most for. It leaves the likes of Murray and Federer to fight over the scraps. Certainly Federer, when at his most dominant and imperious, never used to care so much about tournaments such as these. Now, though, he seems grateful for the ranking points they can offer him. His performance yesterday was a battling one: two tie-breaks were needed for him to progress, the final one of which being marked by a stunning comeback in which he had to save four set points. It suggests a Murray victory today. Firstly, he seems the more in form of the two and, secondly, the fact it's a best of three means that a Murray loss of concentration probably won't be a factor. 2.58pm: Some stats: Murray has beaten Federer eight times, while Federer has beaten him six times. In the last two finals in which they've met (both in 2010, in Shanghai and Toronto) Murray has won, but Federer has beaten him in actual big finals twice: Australian Open 2010, US Open 2008. Which still points to a Murray win, today then. 3.00pm: The pair haven't played each other since 2010 ATP Tour Finals and Federer reckons today's match is going to be tough: \"We've played each other so many times we know each other's games well. I'm just excited playing against him again after such a long time. Andy is an amazing player, and so far he's proved that this year.\" 3.07pm: It's chilly in Dubai apparently. Or at least not blazingly hot anyway. Federer won't be able to play that terrifying mind-game trick of his of not ever sweating in the heat. 3.12pm: The players are out on court, the coin has been tossed and a few snaps have been taken. Murray's in red, clean-shaven and looking relaxed. Federer's in black and white and looking entirely unruffled too. First set: *Murray 1-0 Federer (* denotes server): The Murray second serve allows him to take the scores to 15-15 after he conceded the first point of the match, but then two quick, powerful first serves take him to 40-15. Next Murray hits long at the end of a short rally, the ball really pinging about this fast service, before a far longer baseline rally battle is won by a patient Federer to take the scores to deuce. Federer charges into the net after a Murray second serve, but thumps the volley straight into the chord with the Scot well out of the picture. He hits the chord again seconds later as Murray converts his advantage into the game. First set: Murray 1-1 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer entirely takes Murray apart in the first point: he sends him wide with a serve, then fires a glorious backhand across the other side of the court. He then sends Murray scampering about the court again to go to 30-0 and looks ominously powerful. He hits long next, though, and Murray claws a point back before a delicate drop shot takes Federer to 40-15. But then a strong service return earns Murray another point, before Federer nets and the second game goes to deuce too. Murray is attempting to attack Federer's forehand - and well he might after the backhand that began this game - but the Swiss still hits two winners to win the game. First set: *Murray 2-1 Federer (* denotes server): Federer comes barrelling up to the net but Murray spots him, fizzing a winner past his backhand. He goes to 30-0 after some more baseline hitting. Still, Federer takes advantage of a poor Murray second serve and belts a service return straight back past him for 30-15. It gives him the impetus to send an imperious forehand across the court following a decent Murray shot to even things up at 30-30. But Federer nets after a slow Murray serve, then the Scot fires down an ace to claim the game. \"Murray is clean-shaven. Good,\" emails Adam Hirst. \"Perhaps that is part of Lendl's coaching as well. Ditch the bum-fluff stubble, time to be a man Andy. Money's on him today and for a slam this year then.\" First set: Murray 2-2 *Federer (* denotes server): Murray returns weakly from Federer's first serve, allowing the Swiss to clatter across court comprehensively. He then effortlessly strokes another winner past him: 30-0. There's a let next, and then the TV director elects to film the umpire rather than the next point, which Federer wins to go to 40-0. Murray wins one back, before Federer thumps a final winner past him. Federer is looking very, very good. First set: *Murray 3-2 Federer (* denotes server): Murray's first serve is working well - he's averaging 66% of first serves in for the tournament, the TV tells us - and his first one in this game is a belter. But Federer takes the next point, before another baseline rally ends with Federer hitting long: 30-15. Murray gives the umpire the benefit of his lip after a decision is reviewed, before he fires down an ace - called out, which he reviews too - to go to 40-15. Federer charges into the net on the next point but Murray smears the ball past him to clinch the game. \"Fed vs Murray is usually a good watch, but it doesn't answer the only two questions left about both men,\" poses Gary Naylor. \"Can Federer beat two of Nadal, Djokovic and Murray over five sets towards the end of a fortnight's tennis and can Murray banish memories of failure to close out a Slam final? No and No would be my answers.\" First set: Murray 3-3 *Federer (* denotes server): Murray splatters a great winner past Federer, who was rushing into the net. Next, Federer hits long as Murray goes 0-30 up. Federer takes one point back, but hits a backhand into the net as Murray goes to 15-40 up. But he blows the first break point by hitting too long, then blows the second by whizzing a Federer forehand into the net. Federer rules the game from there: eventually winning in some style after sending Murray wide, back, very short, then finally out of the game. First set: *Murray 4-3 Federer (* denotes server): Don't think Federer has actually been broken at all this week, so that would have been a decent feat if Murray had pulled that off. But he didn't. So that's that. Another ace, then some solid defensive play from the back of the court takes Murray to 40-15 before, on the final point, he dominates - eventually rushing to the net to smash the winner. First set: Murray 4-4 *Federer (* denotes server): A nice Murray double-hander takes Federer by surprise, before the Swiss levels the scores at 15-15 having got away with a weak cross-court smash (returned by Murray but put away again by Federer). He clinches the next two points in commanding style before Murray hits a very special cross court return, that Federer is again surprised by. Still, he serves out the game easily enough. First set: *Murray 5-4 Federer (* denotes server): Murray goes to 30-0 after a Federer again attempts a drop shot. Murray is good enough to get to it, though, and Federer nets his return. Murray goes to 40-0 up, then double faults, but his following first serve is accurate, forceful and too good for Federer. First set: Murray 5-5 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer starts strongly and goes to 40-0 with the minimum of effort - though he's helped by a Murray slip agt 15-0. Then Murray lobs him beautifully after he charges into the net - that was so well disguised - but Federer takes the game home on the following point. Incidentally, in that last game, Federer cleared an errant ball to a ball-boy - chipping long to the back of the court. The ball-boy nonchalantly caught it, while still holding another ball, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. My team of cricketing casuals, The Toriano Tigers (I didn't choose the name) could do with someone of that kind of catching ability in the team. If you're reading this, ball-boy, do you fancy joining us? First set: *Murray 5-6 Federer (* denotes server): Murray hits his second double fault of the game, then finishes a rally by hitting long into the corner. He goes 0-30 down and takes a moment to towel himself down. Federer is, of course, not bothering to sweat. Federer then gets a little luck - he mishits a return on Murray's second serve and the ball just about slices over the net. Murray's scampering return just goes out: 0-40. The Scot then takes two points back, the second after a powerful first serve. Masterfully, he then takes the game to deuce after suddenly erupting from the baseline, turning his defence into a clinical attack. He's lucky, though, and despite netting to give Federer advantage, the Swiss then hits a wild forehand to return the scores to deuce - just as a weird howling noise rumbles around the court. Odd. But then Federer does break him! The Swiss wins the game after thrashing a ball at Murray, who can only just get a racket to a return which lobs high into the sky, then out again. Federer wins the first set 7-5: Murray, pointlessly, challenges a good Federer serve, then gets sent to both sides of the court by a dominant Federer: 30-0. The Swiss takes it to 40-0 with the minimum of effort, but Murray is able to claim a point back after two poor serves from Federer. But, with two set points in his pocket, Federer clinches the first set as Murray hits a poor return out. Second set: *Murray 5-7, 1-0 Federer (* denotes server): Murray goes to 30-0 after two dodgy forehands from Federer but then the Swiss dinks the ball just over the net from the baseline. Murray looked as if he could have chipped it back, while hammering into the net, but failed to lift the ball over the chord. Federer then comes into the net and, with the court at his disposal, elects to knock the ball into the tramlines: 40-15. Murray serves the game out with an ace. \"Somebody at the Guardian doesn't like A. Murray or s/he could have found a better photo,\" emails Honor Haidar. \"The one chosen is diabolical!\" I think it gives him a certain focussed intensity. Or it makes him look like he really hates that ball. Second set: Murray 5-7, 1-1 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer thrashes his way to a dominant game to love. Murray is playing too defensively here, sticking to the baseline - or, in fact, a good way behind it - which is going to play in Federer's hands in these fast conditions. Second set: *Murray 5-7, 1-2 Federer (* denotes server): Uh-oh, Murray goes to 0-30 down but, as Federer comes charging into the net, Murray sends a winner up the line and past his opponent: 15-30. Next, though, Murray comes charging into the net - but his drop shot is too long and Federer smashes the ball back past him. Murray replies with what looks like an ace - but Federer correctly challenges it. The Scot's next serve is nothing like as potent and Federer breaks him early in the second set. Second set: Murray 5-7, 1-3 *Federer (* denotes server): An exceptional reply from Federer ends a rally and earns him the first points of the game: the Swiss dinked a floated backhand at an outstanding angle across the court. It gives him the confidence to clinch the next two points - the last of which is an ace - with simplistic ease. Murray then scoops long, looking unblanaced as he does so, and Federer is in clear control of this match at the moment. Second set: *Murray 5-7, 2-3 Federer (* denotes server): Despite appearing to be, like a teetering pile of Jenga bricks, about to fall apart Murray romps to a 40-0 lead in the game. The final point of which features a remarkable Federer return from a very quick Murray second serve - he simply plonked the racket in front of his face and hoped it would go back over. It did, but Murray forces him deep and his return is wild. Murray then cleans up the final point of the match after another woeful return from Federer. From appearing to be completly in control, Federer has just had a shocker of a game. Second set: Murray 5-7, 3-3 *Federer (* denotes server): A Murray unforced error - uncharacteristic of his form recently, but charactersitic of this match - begins proceedings but Federer nets to make the scores 15-15. Then, with dogged tenacity, Murray keeps hitting the ball back at Federer forcing the Swiss to eventually miss. It's a defensive tactic and, on the following point Federer proves why it won't wash - he's powerful and takes the scores to 30-30. But then a brilliant lob after another Federer drop shot gives Murray a break: which he clinches! Murray breaks Federer for the first time this tournament. Second set: *Murray 5-7, 4-3 Federer (* denotes server): Murray attempts an unwise backhand winner down the line, ang goes 0-15 down. There's a long, gruelling rally next - each player rooted to the baseline and beating the ball at each other. Federer eventually nets and it feels suddenly as though Murray is clawing his way back into this. It's a feeling reinforced by his subsequent 212kph ace to go to 30-15. More baseline slugging follows but this time Murray slams the ball into the net: 30-30. He follows that with a double fault and, in the space of a couple of points, that Murray resurgence begins to flicker. Still, he does take the game to deuce, then goes on to advantage and game after a thumping ace. Interesting ... Second set: Murray 5-7, 4-4 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer comes out swinging: he romps to 0-40 with the minimum of fuss. But then after a second service let, Murray flashes a winner back past him to take the score to 15-40. It unsettles Federer for approximately 0.0000023 of a second and he then sends Murray wide on his next serve and the Scot can't get the ball back. Second set: *Murray 5-7, 4-5 Federer (* denotes server): The crowd make it clear who they want to win when Federer goes to 0-40 up after errors from Murray. They're whooping everything Federer does, yet there's silence at anything of Murray's. With three break points, though, Federer splatters a return long and then Murray clatters a reply into the net. Murray is broken again, and Federer will serve for the championship. Second set: Murray 5-7, 4-5 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer's first serve is too strong for Murray and his reply is scrappy and long. He mouths off about something afterwards. Not sure what. 15-0. Then, following a short rally, Federer hits long and looks utterly disgusted with himself: 15-15. He's back on his game shortly afterwards - a great serve puts Murray onto the back foot and the Swiss goes to 30-15. Murray forces his way back into it on the next point, though: 30-30. Next, Federer sends Murray all over the court but, remarkably, he manages to retrieve every return. It's sensational stuff, really, but eventually Murray nets. Match point to Federer ... which he blows. Deuce. Second set: Murray 5-7, 4-5 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer's first serve goes wide. His second forces Murray wide. A long rally follows which Federer wins when Murray goes the wrong way. Federer making all the running in that rally, Murray was just hitting the ball back. Match point. Federer wins! Murray 5-7, 4-6 Federer: Federer wins in two straight sets. He's still barely broken a sweat and that may well knock Murray off his stride. Federer's forehand was good, Murray's serve was not as good as it has been but really it was that old age problem: Murray was too defensive and that allowed Federer to unpick him. Thanks for reading: I'm off. Murray was outplayed today by someone willing to take the initiative. Where he sat back and hoped Federer's forehand would fail (it didn't), Federer was proactive, fluid and aggressive. Still, Murray can take heart from the fact he was able to break Federer: no-one else managed it in this tournament. Cheers all, bye,",

It gives him the impetus to send an imperious forehand across the court following a decent Murray shot to even things up at 30-30. But Federer nets after a slow Murray serve, then the Scot fires down an ace to claim the game. \"Murray is clean-shaven. Good,\" emails Adam Hirst. \"Perhaps that is part of Lendl's coaching as well. Ditch the bum-fluff stubble, time to be a man Andy. Money's on him today and for a slam this year then.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray 2-2 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Murray returns weakly from Federer's first serve, allowing the Swiss to clatter across court comprehensively. He then effortlessly strokes another winner past him: 30-0. There's a let next, and then the TV director elects to film the umpire rather than the next point, which Federer wins to go to 40-0. Murray wins one back, before Federer thumps a final winner past him. Federer is looking very, very good.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>First set: *Murray 3-2 Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Murray's first serve is working well - he's averaging 66% of first serves in for the tournament, the TV tells us - and his first one in this game is a belter. But Federer takes the next point, before another baseline rally ends with Federer hitting long: 30-15. Murray gives the umpire the benefit of his lip after a decision is reviewed, before he fires down an ace - called out, which he reviews too - to go to 40-15. Federer charges into the net on the next point but Murray smears the ball past him to clinch the game. \"Fed vs Murray is usually a good watch, but it doesn't answer the only two questions left about both men,\" poses Gary Naylor. \"Can Federer beat two of Nadal, Djokovic and Murray over five sets towards the end of a fortnight's tennis and can Murray banish memories of failure to close out a Slam final? No and No would be my answers.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray 3-3 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Murray splatters a great winner past Federer, who was rushing into the net. Next, Federer hits long as Murray goes 0-30 up. Federer takes one point back, but hits a backhand into the net as Murray goes to 15-40 up. But he blows the first break point by hitting too long, then blows the second by whizzing a Federer forehand into the net. Federer rules the game from there: eventually winning in some style after sending Murray wide, back, very short, then finally out of the game.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>First set: *Murray 4-3 Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Don't think Federer has actually been broken at all this week, so that would have been a decent feat if Murray had pulled that off. But he didn't. So that's that. Another ace, then some solid defensive play from the back of the court takes Murray to 40-15 before, on the final point, he dominates - eventually rushing to the net to smash the winner.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray 4-4 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> A nice Murray double-hander takes Federer by surprise, before the Swiss levels the scores at 15-15 having got away with a weak cross-court smash (returned by Murray but put away again by Federer). He clinches the next two points in commanding style before Murray hits a very special cross court return, that Federer is again surprised by. Still, he serves out the game easily enough.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>First set: *Murray 5-4 Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Murray goes to 30-0 after a Federer again attempts a drop shot. Murray is good enough to get to it, though, and Federer nets his return. Murray goes to 40-0 up, then double faults, but his following first serve is accurate, forceful and too good for Federer.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray 5-5 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Federer starts strongly and goes to 40-0 with the minimum of effort - though he's helped by a Murray slip agt 15-0. Then Murray lobs him beautifully after he charges into the net - that was so well disguised - but Federer takes the game home on the following point. Incidentally, in that last game, Federer cleared an errant ball to a ball-boy - chipping long to the back of the court. The ball-boy nonchalantly caught it, while still holding another ball, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. My team of cricketing casuals, The Toriano Tigers (I didn't choose the name) could do with someone of that kind of catching ability in the team. If you're reading this, ball-boy, do you fancy joining us?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>First set: *Murray 5-6 Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Murray hits his second double fault of the game, then finishes a rally by hitting long into the corner. He goes 0-30 down and takes a moment to towel himself down. Federer is, of course, not bothering to sweat. Federer then gets a little luck - he mishits a return on Murray's second serve and the ball just about slices over the net. Murray's scampering return just goes out: 0-40. The Scot then takes two points back, the second after a powerful first serve. Masterfully, he then takes the game to deuce after suddenly erupting from the baseline, turning his defence into a clinical attack. He's lucky, though, and despite netting to give Federer advantage, the Swiss then hits a wild forehand to return the scores to deuce - just as a weird howling noise rumbles around the court. Odd. But then Federer does break him! The Swiss wins the game after thrashing a ball at Murray, who can only just get a racket to a return which lobs high into the sky, then out again.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Federer wins the first set 7-5:</strong> Murray, pointlessly, challenges a good Federer serve, then gets sent to both sides of the court by a dominant Federer: 30-0. The Swiss takes it to 40-0 with the minimum of effort, but Murray is able to claim a point back after two poor serves from Federer. But, with two set points in his pocket, Federer clinches the first set as Murray hits a poor return out.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 5-7, 1-0 Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Murray goes to 30-0 after two dodgy forehands from Federer but then the Swiss dinks the ball just over the net from the baseline. Murray looked as if he could have chipped it back, while hammering into the net, but failed to lift the ball over the chord. Federer then comes into the net and, with the court at his disposal, elects to knock the ball into the tramlines: 40-15. Murray serves the game out with an ace. \"Somebody at the Guardian doesn't like A. Murray or s/he could have found a better photo,\" emails Honor Haidar. \"The one chosen is diabolical!\" I think it gives him a certain focussed intensity. Or it makes him look like he really hates that ball.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 5-7, 1-1 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Federer thrashes his way to a dominant game to love. Murray is playing too defensively here, sticking to the baseline - or, in fact, a good way behind it - which is going to play in Federer's hands in these fast conditions.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 5-7, 1-2 Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Uh-oh, Murray goes to 0-30 down but, as Federer comes charging into the net, Murray sends a winner up the line and past his opponent: 15-30. Next, though, Murray comes charging into the net - but his drop shot is too long and Federer smashes the ball back past him. Murray replies with what looks like an ace - but Federer correctly challenges it. The Scot's next serve is nothing like as potent and Federer breaks him early in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 5-7, 1-3 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> An exceptional reply from Federer ends a rally and earns him the first points of the game: the Swiss dinked a floated backhand at an outstanding angle across the court. It gives him the confidence to clinch the next two points - the last of which is an ace - with simplistic ease. Murray then scoops long, looking unblanaced as he does so, and Federer is in clear control of this match at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 5-7, 2-3 Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Despite appearing to be, like a teetering pile of Jenga bricks, about to fall apart Murray romps to a 40-0 lead in the game. The final point of which features a remarkable Federer return from a very quick Murray second serve - he simply plonked the racket in front of his face and hoped it would go back over. It did, but Murray forces him deep and his return is wild. Murray then cleans up the final point of the match after another woeful return from Federer. From appearing to be completly in control, Federer has just had a shocker of a game.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 5-7, 3-3 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> A Murray unforced error - uncharacteristic of his form recently, but charactersitic of this match - begins proceedings but Federer nets to make the scores 15-15. Then, with dogged tenacity, Murray keeps hitting the ball back at Federer forcing the Swiss to eventually miss. It's a defensive tactic and, on the following point Federer proves why it won't wash - he's powerful and takes the scores to 30-30. But then a brilliant lob after another Federer drop shot gives Murray a break: which he clinches! Murray breaks Federer for the first time this tournament.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 5-7, 4-3 Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Murray attempts an unwise backhand winner down the line, ang goes 0-15 down. There's a long, gruelling rally next - each player rooted to the baseline and beating the ball at each other. Federer eventually nets and it feels suddenly as though Murray is clawing his way back into this. It's a feeling reinforced by his subsequent 212kph ace to go to 30-15. More baseline slugging follows but this time Murray slams the ball into the net: 30-30. He follows that with a double fault and, in the space of a couple of points, that Murray resurgence begins to flicker. Still, he does take the game to deuce, then goes on to advantage and game after a thumping ace. Interesting ...</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 5-7, 4-4 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Federer comes out swinging: he romps to 0-40 with the minimum of fuss. But then after a second service let, Murray flashes a winner back past him to take the score to 15-40. It unsettles Federer for approximately 0.0000023 of a second and he then sends Murray wide on his next serve and the Scot can't get the ball back.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 5-7, 4-5 Federer (* denotes server):</strong> The crowd make it clear who they want to win when Federer goes to 0-40 up after errors from Murray. They're whooping everything Federer does, yet there's silence at anything of Murray's. With three break points, though, Federer splatters a return long and then Murray clatters a reply into the net. Murray is broken again, and Federer will serve for the championship.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 5-7, 4-5 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Federer's first serve is too strong for Murray and his reply is scrappy and long. He mouths off about something afterwards. Not sure what. 15-0. Then, following a short rally, Federer hits long and looks utterly disgusted with himself: 15-15. He's back on his game shortly afterwards - a great serve puts Murray onto the back foot and the Swiss goes to 30-15. Murray forces his way back into it on the next point, though: 30-30. Next, Federer sends Murray all over the court but, remarkably, he manages to retrieve every return. It's sensational stuff, really, but eventually Murray nets. Match point to Federer ... which he blows. Deuce.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 5-7, 4-5 *Federer (* denotes server):</strong> Federer's first serve goes wide. His second forces Murray wide. A long rally follows which Federer wins when Murray goes the wrong way. Federer making all the running in that rally, Murray was just hitting the ball back. Match point.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Federer wins! Murray 5-7, 4-6 Federer:</strong> Federer wins in two straight sets. He's still barely broken a sweat and that may well knock Murray off his stride. Federer's forehand was good, Murray's serve was not as good as it has been but really it was that old age problem: Murray was too defensive and that allowed Federer to unpick him.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Thanks for reading:</strong> I'm off. Murray was outplayed today by someone willing to take the initiative. Where he sat back and hoped Federer's forehand would fail (it didn't), Federer was proactive, fluid and aggressive. Still, Murray can take heart from the fact he was able to break Federer: no-one else managed it in this tournament. Cheers all, bye,</p>",

The big political history of the city jostled for attention with the personal stories of those taking part in tracing their family trees or hearing about the evolution of Mancunian Films, alternative publishing and more. In less crowded surroundings of the Friends' Meeting House, a series of talks tacked everything from the city's computing achievements to the legacy of the reforming philanthropists. My pick of the talks DJ and writer Dave Haslam talked about the evolution of the city's alternative music magazines and launched some new magazines which have been produced by students working on a project at Hotspur House.

Ferguson takes Manchester United to White Hart Lane on Sunday and, asked if the speculation might prove a distraction, he said: \"Its difficult to say. I think the people who will be more concerned are the directors, they'll be worried, unless there's been contact between the FA and Spurs. \"I would doubt that at this moment in time but I'm sure they'll be wondering what the next step is in relation to the contact the FA make and when they make it. I don't think you can dismiss that eventuality. It's going to happen and they'll be more worried than the players.\" Ten years ago, Ferguson was due to retire but changed his mind and he suggested that, although Redknapp's situation is different, uncertainty can affect the dressing room. \"Yes, I made that mistake myself.

      "bodyText": "A maverick detective is one of the oldest stock characters in popular entertainment: the drinker, the brawler, the loner who bends the rules. It is a hoary television tradition that dictates that, just as surely as the hero will eventually be given 24 hours to bring in the evidence, his domestic dynamic will revolve around whether or not his patient girlfriend, or possibly ex-wife, will put up with all the grief. Now, however, a new stable of highly strung female detectives has taken charge of the crime scene, equipped with the sort of extreme psychological problems that rival those of the killers and terrorists they are tracking down. Chief among these fresh recruits is Carrie Mathison, the bipolar obsessive played by Claire Danes in the hit US series Homeland, now showing on Channel 4. Not only is Mathison an unreliable central character, she has to covertly get hold of drugs to stabilise her condition. If she reveals her mental health history, she will lose her job with the CIA and, the viewer fears, the convert to Islam who has become a fundamentalist that she is secretly watching will go unpunished. \"She is a mess,\" Danes has said. \"I don't really spend much time thinking about seducing an audience or protecting her status as being appealing or likeable. I find the challenge is finding a way to play the truth of her being chemically unstable and also a really proficient, highly capable CIA agent. How can those two things coexist?\" Mathison's condition means she has no discernible interest in friends, a social life or family. Instead, she intermittently paints her toenails, puts on a glittery top and goes to a bar to pick up a one-night stand. Danes's agent is perhaps the most glamorous and most convincingly unruly sleuth in a stressed-out line-up that now includes the alienated and abused geek Lisbeth Salander from Stieg Larsson's Swedish Millennium trilogy, the socially inept Sarah Lund from The Killing and, most recently, the damaged and isolated Katrine Ries Jensen, played by Laura Bach, in the Danish police procedural Those Who Kill, the show bought by ITV3 as a bid for its own chic, psychologically challenged leading lady. Danes's portrayal of Mathison has won critical praise, earning her a Golden Globe for best actress, and the role pushes the concept of a flawed heroine into unexplored territory: her reliance on pharmaceuticals appears to keep her either on-track, or off it \u2013 the viewer is not quite sure. The actress, now 32, is one of those rare talents to survive an early break into showbusiness as a child star. She appeared on a number of mainstream US television series as a girl and teenager and received her first Golden Globe, along with an Emmy nomination, for playing a 15-year-old in acclaimed drama series My So-Called Life, although the show was cancelled after 19 episodes. \"We were doing something that turned out to be really relevant and lasting, but how could I have any clue?\" Danes has said. \"I had no idea what the Golden Globes were. But I knew a lot about being miserable and 14 and that's all I needed to know. When we shot the pilot, it was before I had even been in high school. I stopped going to school and started to live in a soundstage version of it.\" Moving to the big screen for the 1994 film adaptation of Little Women, Danes also appeared as Holly Hunter's daughter in Home for the Holidays, directed by her heroine, Jodie Foster. But the actress grabbed international attention in 1996 when she played Juliet to Leonardo DiCaprio's Romeo in Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet. After making films directed by Francis Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone, Danes then took a leaf from Foster's book and left her career temporarily to study at Yale. \"I knew that I was young and hadn't really explored all of my interests as fully as possible, so I wasn't entirely sure if I was acting out of habit or real desire, and sure enough the latter proved to be true, but I just feel safer now, being certain of that,\" she has explained, adding that her film star status quickly palled at Yale, where everyone else was \"sort of extraordinary and a little odd\". Her two years there, she has said, gave her an understanding of what kind of acting she wanted to do, but it is not something a star can always put into practice. \"So much of it is not up to us, especially in film. Our roles are filtered through so many different people, the director, the editor. What ends up on the screen is not necessarily what we intended to do.\" In 2002, Danes returned to Hollywood, co-starring, among other parts, as Meryl Streep's daughter in the Oscar-nominated The Hours. In 2007, she appeared in the fantasy Stardust, a film she described as a \"classic model of romantic comedy\". This was followed by a Broadway stage debut as Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion, but she says that she is also drawn to painting and dancing, which provide a sense of direction and order that are missing for an actor on a film set. \"I probably would paint before I would direct,\" she said recently. \"My parents were visual artists so I grew up drawing and I've been dancing again the last four years. I can return to that in time and I have much more control over that.\" Danes, who is married to British actor Hugh Dancy, won another Golden Globe last year for playing an autistic woman in HBO's series Temple Grandin. She clearly took the job of representing the condition on screen seriously. \"I worked with a dialogue coach and she really did assemble a Rosetta Stone of how Temple would speak. I still sometimes revert to Temple-speak.\" To research the role of CIA agent Mathison for Homeland, she also visited real agents in their workplace and asked them about the part that gender and sex play in their work: \"It can be an asset and used to their advantage, but it can also be problematic, and then they have to be creative about how to resolve that. It's a real issue in Arab cultures, where men don't have relationships with women like we do here.\" More relevant perhaps than gender to the role though is the mental status of Mathison. Just like Salander, Lund and Ries Jensen, the social deficiencies of the character are linked to their particular skill. It seems that female detectives, unlike their male counterparts, must be more than just maverick. \"I joke that she [Mathison] responds really well to the meds, but I have to believe that is true,\" Danes has recently revealed. \"We're still deciding where she's at on that spectrum. She probably has a more modest condition. They're related in some ways [the job and the disorder]. They both involve paranoia, and when somebody's mind is susceptible to that, they're constantly questioning themselves and the world around them and that translates pretty easily into her work.\" When Helen Mirren's apparently competent Jane Tennison is shown reaching for the bottle in Prime Suspect, the scene will never have the same impact again.",

      "bodyText": "The domestic violence charity Refuge could face closure this summer amid funding cuts of 50%, its chief executive has warned. The charity, which supports 1,600 women and children, has seen funds decimated and is now \"fighting for our very survival\", Sandra Horley said. She spoke out after reports that hundreds of domestic violence victims are being turned away from women's refuges every day because of a lack of spaces. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that funding from local authorities to organisations working with domestic-violence and victims of sexual abuse fell from \u00a37.8m in 2010-11 to \u00a35.4m in the current financial year. The cuts have prompted accusations that the coalition's austerity measures are unfairly affecting women, and putting them directly at risk. Horley said: \"As CEO of Refuge for nearly three decades, I have never been so worried about our future. \"The domestic violence sector is being decimated. Refuge is stretched to breaking point. We are now fighting for our very survival, desperately trying to raise voluntary funds to keep our doors open. If we don't do this by the summer, we may face closure. \"What kind of a world do we live in where women and children are beaten and funding for services to protect them is being withdrawn? Britain is in danger of returning to the days of Cathy Come Home when the vulnerable were forced to sleep rough. Abused women could find themselves in a dilemma: stay at home and risk being killed or flee with their children to sleep on the streets.\" Horley also questioned the government's intention to introduce Clare's law \u2013 a new disclosure scheme which enables women to request information from the police about their partner's previous convictions. She said the domestic violence sector did not support the initiative and she believed funding would be better invested in improving the basic police response to domestic violence, \"which is still extremely poor in forces across the country\". Last year two refuges, looking after women from ethnic-minority backgrounds, were closed. Official estimates suggested there were 400,000 incidents of domestic violence in the UK last year. Around 230 women seeking refuge from abusive partners were turned away because of lack of spaces every day, campaigners said. Earlier this year, Lynne Featherstone, the Home Office minister for equality, denied there was a crisis in the domestic violence support sector. She said: \"I would rebut very firmly that the sector is in crisis, this government is putting its best foot forward and is committed to ending violence against women and girls\". But Vivienne Hayes, the chief executive of the Women's Resource Centre, which represents 350 small charities and community groups, said: \"Government cuts have impacted more negatively on women than men. You have to wonder whether this is a case of institutional sexism.\"",

      "bodyText": "I cannot think about March being Women's History Month without remembering Mrs Lillian Williams, my 12th-grade English teacher at Henry Snyder High School in my hometown of Jersey City, New Jersey. Mrs Williams died of cancer in September 2010, and it was one of the saddest days of my life. I only attended Snyder High for one year, after being kicked out of another school for saying something rude to my guidance counselor. When he realized I did not even live in that school's district, he had me shipped to Snyder. At that time, Snyder High had a reputation as one of the worst schools in the state of New Jersey. Indeed, when I showed up, students were out front smoking cigarettes, arguing or fighting, and openly dissing each other, teachers, and administrators. I had not seen anything like that since my early years at an inner-city grade school. So, here I was now at a high school that was 99% poor and black or Latino, where many of the teachers seemed either terrified or indifferent to the students. Yet, there was Mrs Williams, forever smiling, forever optimistic, and clearly madly in love with us students. I simply did not get her at first \u2013 her litany of sayings like \"A dictionary is man's best literary friend,\" or why she took a particularly keen interest in me once she recognized I could write and had a deep love of books. Truth be told, I was utterly afraid of what the world had awaiting a ghetto child like me, as I approached high-school graduation and my 18th birthday \u2013 the age my mother had declared from the time I could comprehend words at which I had to go either to college or to the military, anything that would take me away from her care, once and for all. Mrs Williams was the first teacher I ever had who aggressively encouraged me to write, who put me in two different essay contests, including a city-wide competition \u2013 which I won, landing me in the local newspaper. I cannot tell you how low my self-esteem was during my youth \u2013 and how much Mrs Williams' belief in me made me believe in myself, made me believe that I could possibly have a life as a writer, something I'd dreamt of since I was 11. And it was Mrs Williams who would not accept my sprained ankle from a track meet as the reason why I could not make a college admissions exam. I had resigned myself to missing it as I could barely walk. Mrs Williams told me she would come and carry me if she had to, to that admissions test. Instead, she drove me there, and waited for several hours until I was done. For she saw something in me that I did not remotely see in myself. The last time I saw Lillian Williams alive was when I was running for US Congress, in the summer of 2010. A fundraiser was organized for me in Jersey City (in spite of my running for office in New York City). My hometown community simply wanted to support my cause. Mrs Williams was no longer herself. Her husband, Dr Franklin Williams, had died the year before, and they had been soulmates, life partners, best friends, and fellow educators. In fact, Dr Williams was the very first black superintendent of schools for Jersey City \u2013 he and she both trailblazers in so many ways, together. Mrs Williams had asked me to be the speaker at her husband's funeral, and I did, telling how he, years before I knew Mrs Williams or their connection, had helped my mother when she was having difficulty with a grade-school principal. Seemingly still distraught over her husband's passing, Lillian Williams was deflated and appeared so very lonely. I felt bad for her and vowed I would call and visit more often. But I never got that opportunity. Within a couple of months, I got word that she was battling cancer. Ever the strong persona, few knew she had the disease. Just a few days after I lost my congressional election, I learned that Mrs Williams had died. I cried uncontrollably, and thought of the woman who never stopped supporting me long after high school, who religiously clipped and saved my articles, bought many of my books, and often showed up to my speeches in the New York area. Lillian Williams followed and supported me literally until her death. At Mrs Williams' funeral, I sat listening to the testimonies of students from different generations with the exact same tales as mine. Of her generosity and kindness. Of her dedication to our educations and to our lives. My admiration and awe of Mrs Lillian Williams, who died at 78, was complete. I had to leave the church for a bit to compose myself, and thought of not returning because I could not accept her death in that moment. But a text from her nephew asked me to come back to say a few words. I cannot recall all I said, but I do remember leading with these words: \"Lillian Williams lives forever.\" And so she does.",

      "bodyText": "Robin van Persie has waited a long time to score at Liverpool and will remember both of the goals that earned Arsenal the points here. His first is the only goal he has scored with his head this season; his second was a winner in the second minute of added time that will rank as one of the best strikes of his career, even though he makes a habit of unanswerable finishes. This volley was not quite in the Marco van Basten class of spectacular, nor was it as jaw-droppingly sumptuous as the one Van Persie scored against Everton this season, but it was a gloriously instinctive piece of skill that silenced Anfield just when it seemed a ninth home draw of the season was on the cards. It was almost a carbon copy of his goal against Everton, even down to Alex Song providing the pass, though given the stage for the game and the significance of the victory in the race for fourth place in the Premier League, this was a cause for greater celebration. Having gone ahead through an own goal and missed another penalty, Liverpool were probably only worth a point, but when Van Persie reached on to Song's long ball forward in stoppage time they were denied even that. There could be no argument against such a decisive score and there was little time left in any case. Van Persie hit the ball as it dropped over his shoulder and surprised Pepe Reina with his speed of thought rather than the power or placement of his shot. \"When you see the ball landing at Van Persie's feet you can always expect something special,\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said. \"With a striker of that quality in the side you always have a chance until you are killed off. Our goalkeeper and centre forward made the difference today because we were not in the game in the first half. One-one at the interval flattered us.\" Liverpool should have gone in front after 17 minutes of an eventful first half when Luis Su\u00e1rez won a penalty, tumbling over Wojciech Szczesny's outstretched leg after pushing the ball past the goalkeeper. There was some doubt about the amount of contact \u2013 and at least a suggestion that Su\u00e1rez was looking to go down \u2013 but it appeared that a foul had been committed so the referee, Mark Halsey, pointed to the spot. Perhaps significantly, he took no further action against the Arsenal goalkeeper, who could have been dismissed but stayed on the field to save his side twice over from Dirk Kuyt's penalty. First Szczesny dived to his right to keep out the spot-kick, then flung himself to his left to palm away the follow-up, which Kuyt might have been better to leave to the better-placed Jordan Henderson. \"The second was the save of the game,\" said Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. \"I wasn't happy about the referee's decision originally, but I heard television had shown it was a penalty.\" Szczesny's good work was wasted six minutes later, when he was beaten by one of his own defenders. Liverpool had put together a good passing move, with Jay Spearing and Stewart Downing launching Henderson down the right wing. The eventual cross was nothing special and, from a good position to intercept, Laurent Koscielny came up with a finish better than any of the home strikers would have managed, smacking the ball past his keeper under no particular pressure. Following up after Szczesny had pushed out a shot from Henderson, Su\u00e1rez hit a post as Liverpool enjoyed their best spell, but just as Arsenal seemed to be struggling to contain their opponents they drew level, with a goal of clinical quality produced out of nothing. Bacary Sagna was allowed all the time he required to arrow in a pinpoint cross from the right that took Martin Skrtel out of the equation and left Van Persie with the relatively straightforward task of staying in front of Jamie Carragher and heading the ball past Reina from the six-yard line for what was his 30th goal of the season. Su\u00e1rez was unlucky towards the end of the first half when he turned Thomas Vermaelen inside out only to see Szczesny just reach his shot, then Liverpool hit the woodwork again just before the interval when Kuyt touched on Charlie Adam's cross. Liverpool have been denied by the goal-frame more often than any other Premier League club this season and while some will say that shows the extent of their attacking intent, others would suggest there is room for improvement in their finishing. Arsenal lost Mikel Arteta with a neck injury at the start of the second half after an accidental collision with Henderson, but continued to hold their own against a Liverpool midfield that lacked Steven Gerrard, injured while playing for England in midweek. They might have taken the lead on 70 minutes when Theo Walcott's shot took a late deflection off Skrtel to bring a sharp reaction save from Reina, though they could also have gone behind at around the same stage in the game. Kuyt's excellent cross from the right fell to Martin Kelly, at the far post, who finished like a full-back suffering a nosebleed from being too high up the pitch. To his credit, Kenny Dalglish did not attempt to claim an injustice had taken place or that Liverpool were only beaten by a wonder strike. \"The scoreline didn't reflect the game, but that was our own fault,\" the Liverpool manager said. \"We played well and did enough to have won, but we were beaten because we didn't score enough goals when we were dominating the game. The result was the only disappointing thing. The next lesson we need to learn might be how to be ugly and win.\"",

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday 8 April 2008, the time 9.23pm, 19-year-old Arsenal starlet Theo Walcott picked the ball up on the edge of his own area and embarked on a skittering run towards Anfield Road. Beating four men, he made it to the byline to the right of the Liverpool area, and pulled the ball across for Emmanuel Adebayor, who scored what was surely the goal to send Arsenal into the semi-finals of the Champions League. Walcott was destined to be carried off the pitch shoulder high, garlanded for a truly world-class display of skill, the hero of the hour. Sadly, Kolo Toure was clumping around down the other end, and seconds later upended Ryan Babel in the box. Oh dear! Well, that's that, then. Po' Theo's signature moment thus ruined, and duly forgotten, the young lad now spends most of his time dodging an inordinate number of brickbats, sent whizzing in the direction of his noggin by fans incredulous at his inability to transfer all that raw potential into world-class end product. Po' Theo! Po' Theo's a-cold! Still, there was some redemption last weekend when, after copping flak from his own support during a lame first-half showing against Tottenham Hotspur, he got it together in the second period to crown Arsenal's stunning comeback win. Onwards and upwards? Liverpool, meanwhile, haven't beaten Arsenal at home since that game, suffering two painful draws and a defeat. But they have some hope of reversing that trend: Andriy Arshavin, who scored all four in a 4-4 draw in 2008/09, then notched the winner the following season, has buggered off. As has Roy Hodgson, whose honeymoon period as Liverpool boss lasted 89 minutes at the beginning of last season, until Pepe Reina succumbed to Mr Roy's morbid defeatism and threw the ball into his own net in disgust. Kick off: 12.45pm. No Steven Gerrard today, so Liverpool might have a functioning centre midfield: Reina, Kelly, Skrtel, Carragher, Jose Enrique, Spearing, Kuyt, Henderson, Adam, Downing, Suarez. Subs: Doni, Carroll, Maxi, Coates, Shelvey, Flanagan, Bellamy. Robin van Persie is fit for Arsenal, which has got to be good news for them: Szczesny, Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Arteta, Song, Walcott, Rosicky, Benayoun, van Persie. Subs: Fabianski, Diaby, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jenkinson, Gervinho, Chamakh, Miquel. Referee: Mark Halsey (Lancashire) The weather: It is tippping down. Plenty of slick passing, please! The minute to watch: The 90th. There have been six goals scored in the final minute - or in injury time - in the last six league meetings between these clubs. Also in those games!!! Three own goals! Two penalties! Three red cards! Entertainment guaranteed! [Disclaimer: entertainment is not guaranteed] Pre-match funks: \"Liverpool's line-up cannot offer but one conclusion: if Arsenal don't win this, Wenger should go,\" writes Sasu Laaksonen, who if memory serves - and sorry if I am either misrepresenting you - is a Liverpool supporter. \"The defensive spine of Carragher, (Agger-less) Skrtl, Spearing and Adam is either tedious horror or hilarious comedy. Liverpool will be out of the top-four race today. Dead certain.\" And now, representing Arsenal, Rob Moline: \"Remember that penalty only as the Arse were fuming that an identical one was not awarded to Hleb two weeks earlier. Liverpool through on dodgy refereeing and rude luck when clearly the second-best team. Where have we heard that before?\" Look at us, all having fun here. Ladies and gentlemen, a pre-match cameo from Mr Steven Gerrard! He trots out onto the field in a well-cut grey suit, and waves the newly won League Cup apologetically for a few seconds, before trotting back down the tunnel. Well, he didn't milk that very much, did he? Not quite as rousing as the time Bill Shankly sent Gordon Milne and Gerry Byrne out with the FA Cup before the 1965 European Cup semi-final against Internazionale. Not quite. \"Do you think Liverpool are better with or without Gerrard?\" asks Avery Kode, before answering his own question in the arch style. \"He may be a non-conformist in terms of unselfish positional play and defensive responsibilities at time, but he's surely the most technical of their Europa League-standard midfield bunch.\" The teams trot out, Liverpool in their trademark red, Arsenal in their away kit of blues various. A warm handshake between Kenny Dalglish and Arsene Wenger, who haven't always hit it off on the touchline, and we're off! Arsenal set the ball rolling, kicking towards the Kop. A tempest is raging. 24 seconds: Downing powers down the left. Vermaelen is across to bundle the ball out for a corner. Nothing comes from the set piece, despite goal machine Martin Skrtel having lumbered up for it. Here's Steven Hughes on The Andrei Arshavin Conundrum: \"The signs were, there for those who wanted to see them, before Arsenal even bought the man. The wonderful Euro 2008 performances against the Netherlands and Sweden were then followed by a bankrupt, non-existent display against Spain in the semi-final. He went from being the East European Messi to being the proto-Stewart Downing all within the space of three games. 3 min: A first touch for Suarez, who is booed by the Arsenal fans in front of him as he bustles down the left. He wins a corner, which is swung to the far post. Kelly meets it with his head, but sends the effort wide right. That was half a chance. Liverpool have started quite strongly here. \"Let me join the rest of the world in having an opinion on Andy Carroll,\" begs Tom Fraine. Fair enough. \"I personally think he's a slovenly lump, but this is the one game I'd have started him in. I saw him scare the bejeezus out of Arsenal at the Emirates last year (for the Magpies), and with Arsenal's dodgy central defence you'd back him to score.\" 4 min: Suarez bothers Vermaelen down the inside-left channel, and nearly breaks clear. Play's pulled back, the Liverpool striker being this much offside. But Arsenal are playing a dangerous game here, having looked shaky down their right side three times already. 5 min: Walcott, in the Liverpool box just to the right of goal, brings a long ball down wonderfully with one silky touch. Jose Enrique is over very quickly to cover before the Arsenal winger can get a shot away. This is a very open start. More, please! 7 min: Kuyt is found free down the inside-left channel by a clever pass from Spearing. He's a blond ringlet or two offside. Arsenal are not looking totally confident at the back, but since when has that been news? 8 min: Up the other end, Walcott is proving a persistent pain. Again he traps a long ball dead, raked down the inside-right channel, and manages to get a low and hard shot on target from a tight-ish angle, ten yards out. Reina is behind it, but only just: parried low, the ball balloons up into the sky, and is then claimed by the keeper at the second attempt. 10 min: Oh dear, Stewart Downing. Suarez goes after a ball down the middle. He's clear of the Arsenal defence, but Szczesny slides out quickly to deflect the ball from Suarez's path. The ball drops to Downing, 35 yards out, with the goal gaping. Sadly for Liverpool, their \u00a320m man has none of Xabi Alonso's long-distance skills, and he misses the ball with a fresh-air swipe. Dear lord. 11 min: It's proper komik kutz from long distance now. This time it's Sagna who makes himself look ridiculous, cutting inside from the right and taking a shot from 25 yards. The ball flies out on the left touchline, about 25 yards from the corner flag. If there was no stand to get in the way, that shot would probably have sailed through a full 360 degrees and hit Sagna on the back of his head. Professional football, we're watching here, ladies and gentlemen. 14 min: Suarez robs Song in the centre circle, and Liverpool are two on two. It's a marvellous opportunity for Liverpool, with their players travelling at pace, and the Arsenal defenders backtracking, but Suarez, moving down the inside-right channel, rolls a pass inside behind Henderson, who has to check his run and the momentum is gone. 15 min: Downing is in on goal, bombing after a flick down the inside-right channel from Kuyt. He cocks his leg to shoot from ten yards, but out of nowhere Sagna pops over to take the ball off his toe. Brilliant defending. \"Interesting to see two England wide men on the pitch,\" lies Gary Naylor. \"While Walcott continues to tantalise with glimpses of what might be, Downing merely confirms what never was. England should think about Leighton Baines as a wide man - he would be the Moneyball option.\" 18 min: PENALTY! NOT THAT LIVERPOOL USUALLY BOTHER SCORING THEM! Suarez, booed mercilessly by the away fans, turns Arsenal inside out down the left with a one-two with Kuyt. Wonderful skill. He closes in on goal from a tight angle on the left, but is upended by Szczesny, sliding out feet first. Or is he? On second look, that appears a wee bit theatrical from Suarez, though there might have been contact before the triple salchow and pike. Still, either way, it's given. 19 min: And it's missed! Kuyt hits a poor effort towards the bottom left. It's parried back out by Szczesny, but into the middle of the gaping goal. Henderson is coming in from deep to hammer home, but Kuyt decides to get in the way and cushion a side-foot goalwards himself. Szczesny somehow springs up and gets across to save! Stunning goalkeeping, and more penalty-based incompetence from Liverpool who, despite last weekend's shenanigans at Wembley, have been laughably poor from 12 yards this season. It's like Michael Owen never left. 23 min: OWN GOAL! Liverpool 1-0 Arsenal. Speaing slides a peach of a pass down the right to set Henderson free. Henderson whips a low ball towards the near post. It should be easily cleared, but Koscielny slides in to flash a clearance into the bottom-right corner of the net. Dear oh dear, what a hapless shambles. All we need now are those red cards and a goal in the final minute. 25 min: Liverpool so unlucky not to make it two here. A lovely sweeping move finds Henderson in space on the right-hand edge of the area. He sidefoots a crisp low shot towards the bottom left, but the ezxczellent Szczesny palms it out. Suarez, coming in from a tight angle on the left, hits the loose ball against the left-hand post. Not for the first time this season - in fact, for the 458th time this season - Liverpool are left shaking their heads as the woodwork vibrates. \"Jim Beglin on ESPN said Downing's chance landed on his 'weaker foot',\" reports Colm Cosgrove, \"but surely that should be 'weakest foot', seeing as both feet are useless.\" 28 min: Arsenal were rocking awhile there, but seem to have settled a wee bit. It's been a very open game so far. Both sets of fans are giving it plenty. 30 min: GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Arsenal. Liverpool are caught snoozing here. Sagna is in miles of space down the right, nobody near him at all. He has all the time he needs to swing in a perfect cross onto the head of Van Persie, on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box. Van Persie heads into the right-hand side of the net, almost in slow motion, with Liverpool's defence standing dotted around him. So simple, like a training-ground drill. 33 min: Liverpool probe down the left a couple of times, first through Downing, then Kuyt, but nothing's doing. They're seeing most of the ball, but doing little with it. That goal - which came out of nothing - has taken some of the wind from their sails. \"I think the 25th minute's Colm Cosgrove just means 'foot',\" suggests Mac Millings. 35 min: All a bit scrappy at the moment. Spearing catches Rosicky on the shin, and is lucky to get away without a booking. \"If I ever find myself up against the wall facing a firing squad, I pray that the shooters are all wearing Liverpool shirts,\" writes Justin Kavanagh, in an email entitled \"Poor execution\". 38 min: Liverpool are triangulating at speed in the middle of the park, but going nowhere fast. It looks pretty, though. 40 min: Suarez turns on the edge of the area, just to the left, and goes on a mazy run goalwards. It's a scintillating skedaddle, turning away from Song and beating Koscielny, Vermaelen, Song again, and Koscielny again. Suarez attempts to guide the ball across Szczesny into the bottom right corner, but the keeper - who is really on his game today - palms it round the post. That would arguably have been goal of the season had it gone in. 43 min: Arsenal have done nothing up front since their goal. But there's a sense that it's Liverpool who are getting frustrated. They really should be leading this match, but as is their way at Anfield this season, have little to show for all their efforts. \"Even as a Liverpool fan it's comforting to see the world working fairly,\" writes Niall Mullen. \"Liverpool fail to win so many games simply because of a lack of quality. It's not rocket surgery.\" 45 min: There will be two added minutes of this half. HALF TIME: Liverpool 1-1 Arsenal. Liverpool hit the post again! Jose Enrique feeds Adam down the left. Adam fires a low ball into the six-yard box. Kuyt gets just ahead of Szczesny, and dinks the ball past the advancing keeper and towards the gaping right-hand side of the net. But the ball turns as it slowly bounces towards the goalline, and predictably hits the upright before bouncing out. A sense that Liverpool might as well give up. And that's that for the half, Liverpool stomping off down the tunnel, Arsenal wandering in for the break looking perfectly pleased with the way things have gone. And who could blame them? HALF-TIME ENTERTAINMENT (for drunk children): It's been tipping down, so here's a short cartoon about the rain. It's from the 1980s, and used to be shown on Channel 4 whenever they'd not sold enough advertising, which was always. It's spectacularly depressing, even by 1980s Channel 4 standards. The main character gets up and decides to take life by the scruff of the neck. With this in mind, he goes for a walk, but turns around at the first sight of rain, and goes back to bed, where he drinks a bottle of brandy dry. Children's television's not what it was. And we're off again! Liverpool set the ball rolling again, and they're kicking towards the Kop in this half, as is their wont. \"Liverpool might be getting frustrated, but their play has been much better than the last few weeks because of Carroll's absence,\" suggests Mike Phillips. \"It's not just his individual play that hinders Liverpool, its the way he makes the team around him play - slow, long and ponderous. Suarez and kuyt look much livlier without him. Kenny et al are just trying to save face by playing him.\" 47 min: Kuyt, Suarez and Henderson tippy-tap some nice one-touch stuff down the right, Suarez breaking clear down the wing. He reaches the box, but there are no options for him in the middle, and his weak shot billows the side netting. \"I am not sure where the 'Arsenal in crisis' bandwagon currently is,\" writes Liam Moseley. \"However the one thing that has struck me in this match is that Arsenal are no where near as comfortable on the ball as they used to be. The difference is really telling.\" 48 min: The half stops almost as soon as it starts, Arteta having clashed accidentally with Henderson in the middle of the park. It looks something and nothing, but a concerned Suarez is over him and quickly shouting for the physio. 50 min: Arteta is currently being bundled onto the stretcher. I say bundled; obviously the medical men are taking no chances and treating him very gingerly. This will take another couple of minutes. Meanwhile, on Sky they're showing a super-slow-mo of the Suarez penalty incident in the first half. It does look like the Arsenal keeper caught him with his shin, though Suarez did make a meal of it with a fancy fling. 52 min: Arteta - formerly of Everton, let's not forget - is given a loud round of applause as he departs on the stretcher. That was a very strange incident; Arteta seemed to turn into Henderson at high speed, without realising the Liverpool player was there. He's replaced by Diaby, and given best wishes by a concerned Henderson as he leaves. 54 min: Diaby's first involvement: sending a low shot towards the bottom-right corner. Reina is behind it all the way. \"Why was Murun Buchstansanger naked?\" wonders Paul Gordon, who may as well be asking me the meaning of life. \"He was looking pretty buff for a rodent/alien with no discernible legs who spent his day in bed drinking brandy. I assume his biceps gets the same work-out I do lying in bed until two on Saturday afternoon.\" 56 min: An injury update on Arteta: he took a whack to the jaw, and is suffering severe concussion. \"For all Liverpool's bleating about hitting the woodwork so often and being so unlucky, can we just be honest for a second here?\" asks Alex Till. \"Hitting the woodwork is missing the target.\" 57 min: Van Persie is this close to Suarezing past five Liverpool challenges down the inside-right channel and breaking into the box. Wonderous run. Walcott joins in as a melee ensues. Eventually Skrtel clears. Arsenal strung quite a few passes together before Van Persie went on his solo run, their first pretty patterns of the match. 58 min: Downing nearly releases Suarez into the area down the left, but his pass is too strong. Play sweeps up the other end, and Walcott gains a yard down the inside right. He's got the opportunity of a shot from the edge of the area, and takes it, but blazes wildly into the stand. 60 min: I haven't seen him, but the Arsenal fans are singing \"What a waste of money\", so I can only assume Andy Carroll is warming up for Liverpool. I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb there. 62 min: A ball swung into the Arsenal area from the right. Level with the far post, eight yards out, Super Striker Skrtel heads down into the six-yard box, but it's only Kelly in the middle, and the right back can't get his toe onto the ball. Szczesny gets there first, and clears out Vermaelen while he does so. Cue more treatment, though the defender will be OK by the looks of it. 64 min: Vermaelen goes in the book for sweeping Suarez's legs away from behind. No complaints. 66 min: Carragher is this close from Sandy Browning the ball into his own net, Rosicky dinking in a cross from the right, the Liverpool defender throwing himself at it before withdrawing his neck at the last second. \"Do you remember this thing?\" asks Rich Soden... \"Heron and crane. Many a dreadful gloomy Sunday I spent waiting for the advertised Serie A game only for a posh woman to announce (without a shade of remorse) 'And now a real treat for you as channel 4 screens the jury prize winning...'. 68 min: Downing looks to jink past (yes, really) Song down the right. He's upended. A free kick in a dangerous area. Adam scuffs possibly the worst free kick in the history of all sport into the box. It's cleared by the front man. Where have all these \u00a310m set pieces gone? 69 min: Liverpool should be leading. Kuyt whips a majestic low ball along the corridor of uncertainty from the right. It beats all of Arsenal's defenders and the keeper, and ends up at the feet of Kelly at the far post. With the goal gaping, he manages to figure-of-eight his legs, letting the ball sail through the gap. What a miss. Liverpool are becoming brazenly profligate. 71 min: Arsenal should be leading. They carve Liverpool apart down the left. The ball's sent into the centre by Song, to the feet of Walcott, eight yards out who hits a shot goalwards. The ball takes a couple of deflections, pinballing off Skrtel and Carragher, and looks to have wrongfooted Reina, who is diving to his right as the ball goes to his left. The keeper flings a foot out, and stops brilliantly. How did that stay out? 74 min: Gervinho replaces Benayoun. \"Clearly the finest piece of Russian animation was the Russian version of Itchy and Scratchy,\" writes Rajiv, of the majestic Worker &amp; Parasite. 75 min: Downing races clear down the left. He's got Suarez in the middle, waiting to sidefoot home, so he passes the ball straight into Szczesny's arms. \"I bet that Henderson and Downing heard the waste-of-money chant,\" begins Steven Hughes, \"pulled their collars away from their throats with their index fingers, before sighing with relief as they saw Carroll (luke)warming up on the sideline.\" 76 min: It's pretty loud at Anfield. With that fourth-place finish in mind, Arsenal could do with the three points; Liverpool unquestionably need them. Expect a fiery finish. 77 min: Downing latches onto a loose ball on the edge of the Arsenal area, and screws a hapless shot miles wide right. 79 min: Walcott gets his head on a long ball, but can only flick it on to Reina. Arsenal aren't doing much up front; they'll be much the happier should this end a draw. \"Is this Heron vs. Crane like Alien vs. Predator?\" wonders Paul Gordon. \"Whatever it is, I'm thoroughly enjoying the dulcet tones of the Russian commentator. Like a Cossack Simon Brotherton.\" 80 min: A final change by Arsenal. Oxlade-Chamberlain comes on for the substitute Diaby. \"Isn't Wenger risking the wrath of the Belgian FA by forcing Vermaelen to play the full 90?\" wonders the tinder-dry Charles Hamilton. 82 min: Jose Enrique sprays a lovely ball from the left wing to Henderson, just to the right of the Arsenal goal, ten yards out. Henderson should surely send a volley whistling goalwards, but the confidence-free midfielder attempts to find Suarez in the middle with a cushioned, sidefooted pass, and the chance is gone. Liverpool get their 13th corner of the match out of this - Arsenal, let the records show, have none - but nothing comes of it. 84 min: Adam has the ball, 35 yards from goal. Henderson is free on the right, screaming to be put clean through. Adam elects to spin round and round - 360 degrees, 720 degrees, and so on - like a dog preparing for beddy-byes, or Scott Parker. The pass is never made. Very poor from Liverpool's playmaker. 86 min: \"As a Liverpool fan,\" begins Bryan Coleman, \"I just want to express my frustration. We would be 4-1 up if any of our players could put the ball in the bloody net. I don't really know why I'm still watching - the Arsenal winner is surely on the way. Groundhog Day.\" To cheer you up, here's a great stat nicked from Sky: Steven Gerrard has yet to be on the winning side in a Premier League match this season. 88 min: Downing is replaced by Bellamy. Shouldn't this change have been made earlier? Anything between 87 and 89 minutes earlier? 89 min: Kuyt explodes into an uncharacteristic hot funk over an offside decision. \"@\u00a3%^@$%$^!@,\" he tells the linesman. \"@&amp;*^%\u00a3*&amp;^@%$!!!!\" The referee gives him a stern talking to. 90 min: There will be eight added minutes of this. \"Just to show commentators are clueless everywhere in the world, not just England, the Dutch commentator just called Downing 'a stylistic player with a fine technique',\" writes the wonderfully named xcxcbbbn nbxnxnx. Are you related to Wojciech Szczesny? 90 min +1: A ball from the left pulled into the Arsenal area for Kuyt. The Liverpool striker falls to the ground, with Koscielny nearby. It's no penalty, though the Kop scream for one. Why bother? They'd only miss it. \"After forgetting about the game and becoming engrossed in Heron and Crane, I've come to the conclusion that this wacky pair are the Soviet equivalent of Ross and Rachel,\" writes Paul Gordon. \"I smell a sitcom.\" 90 min +2: WHAT A GOAL! Liverpool 1-2 Arsenal. Wow. This is some finish. Song chips a ball down the inside-left channel. Van Persie's after it. He's onside, and hammers an unstoppable shot past Reina at the keeper's near post. The keeper had no chance. That was simply brilliant. 90 min +3: Spearing is replaced by Carroll. \"Steven Gerrard has yet to be on the winning side in a Premier League game this season?\" splutters Rob Marriott. \"Can I be one of the 1,057 pedants who saw him score the winner against Newcastle a couple of months back?\" Serves me right for parrotting someone else's research. 90 min +4: Gibbs has a dig from tight on the left, but nothing's really happening for him. 90 min +5: This is Liverpool's bid for fourth place out the window, you'd have to say. Unless they score twice in the next three minutes. Which, well, you know. 90 min +6: Van Persie shakes in from the left, nipping past a couple of challenges and rolling the ball inside to Oxlade-Chamberlain, who unleashes a rising fizzer just wide of the top-right corner. Magnificent attempt. 90 min +7: Liverpool's unbeaten home record is about to come to an end. They've only won two of the last ten now. \"I love the contrast between 90 min +2 and then 90 min +3,\" sighs Daniel French. \"Uninspiring to say the least.\" FULL TIME: Liverpool 1-2 Arsenal. And that's it! Robin van Persie has won the day for the visitors. Liverpool carved out most of the chances, but what's the point if you do little or nothing with them? They missed a penalty, fannied around quite a lot, and were punished by brilliance. Liverpool director of football, or whatever he is, Damien Comolli says there'll be no major signings in the summer. If that's the case, Liverpool are going nowhere, and quickly to boot. Arsenal, on the other hand, are still dreaming of next year's Champions League, and possibly finishing above Spurs, the way things are going. The final word to Philip Podolsky, albeit about iron-curtain cartoons: \"The dulcet voice in the Soviet cartoon belongs to one Innokenty Smoktunovsky, basically the Soviet Laurence Olivier. This version of Hamlet is worth looking up for Shostakovitch's wonderful score alone.\"",
      "standfirst": "Liverpool had all the possession, Arsenal all the quality up front. Robin van Persie was the difference",

      "body": "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>On Tuesday 8 April 2008, the time 9.23pm, 19-year-old Arsenal starlet Theo Walcott picked the ball up on the edge of his own area and embarked on a skittering run towards Anfield Road.</strong> Beating four men, he made it to the byline to the right of the Liverpool area, and pulled the ball across for Emmanuel Adebayor, who scored what was surely the goal to send Arsenal into the semi-finals of the Champions League. Walcott was destined to be carried off the pitch shoulder high, garlanded for a truly world-class display of skill, the hero of the hour.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Sadly, Kolo Toure was clumping around down the other end, and seconds later upended Ryan Babel in the box.</strong> Oh dear! Well, that's that, then.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Po' Theo's signature moment thus ruined, and duly forgotten, the young lad now spends most of his time dodging an inordinate number of brickbats, sent whizzing in the direction of his noggin by fans incredulous at his inability to transfer all that raw potential into world-class end product.</strong> Po' Theo! Po' Theo's a-cold! Still, there was some redemption last weekend when, after copping flak from his own support during a lame first-half showing against Tottenham Hotspur, he got it together in the second period to crown Arsenal's stunning comeback win. Onwards and upwards?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Liverpool, meanwhile, haven't beaten Arsenal at home since that game, suffering two painful draws and a defeat.</strong> But they have some hope of reversing that trend: Andriy Arshavin, who scored all four in a 4-4 draw in 2008/09, then notched the winner the following season, has buggered off. As has Roy Hodgson, whose honeymoon period as Liverpool boss lasted 89 minutes at the beginning of last season, until Pepe Reina succumbed to Mr Roy's morbid defeatism and threw the ball into his own net in disgust.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 12.45pm.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>No Steven Gerrard today, so Liverpool might have a functioning centre midfield:</strong> Reina, Kelly, Skrtel, Carragher, Jose Enrique, Spearing, Kuyt, Henderson, Adam, Downing, Suarez.<br>Subs: Doni, Carroll, Maxi, Coates, Shelvey, Flanagan, Bellamy.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Robin van Persie is fit for Arsenal, which has got to be good news for them:</strong> Szczesny, Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Arteta, Song, Walcott, Rosicky, Benayoun, van Persie.<br>Subs: Fabianski, Diaby, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jenkinson, Gervinho, Chamakh, Miquel.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Mark Halsey (Lancashire)</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>The weather:</strong> It is <em>tippping</em> down. Plenty of slick passing, please!</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>The minute to watch:</strong> The 90th. There have been six goals scored in the final minute - or in injury time - in the last six league meetings between these clubs.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Also in those games!!!</strong> Three own goals! Two penalties! Three red cards! Entertainment guaranteed! <em>[Disclaimer: entertainment is not guaranteed]</em></p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>Pre-match funks:</strong> \"Liverpool's line-up cannot offer but one conclusion: if Arsenal don't win this, Wenger should go,\" writes Sasu Laaksonen, who if memory serves - and sorry if I am either misrepresenting you - is a Liverpool supporter. \"The defensive spine of Carragher, (Agger-less) Skrtl, Spearing and Adam is either tedious horror or hilarious comedy. Liverpool will be out of the top-four race today. Dead certain.\" And now, representing Arsenal, Rob Moline: \"Remember that penalty only as the Arse were fuming that an identical one was not awarded to Hleb two weeks earlier. Liverpool through on dodgy refereeing and rude luck when clearly the second-best team. Where have we heard that before?\" Look at us, all having fun here.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen, a pre-match cameo from Mr Steven Gerrard!</strong> He trots out onto the field in a well-cut grey suit, and waves the newly won League Cup apologetically for a few seconds, before trotting back down the tunnel. Well, he didn't milk that very much, did he? Not quite as rousing as the time Bill Shankly sent Gordon Milne and Gerry Byrne out with the FA Cup before the 1965 European Cup semi-final against Internazionale. Not quite. \"Do you think Liverpool are better with or without Gerrard?\" asks Avery Kode, before answering his own question in the arch style. \"He may be a non-conformist in terms of unselfish positional play and defensive responsibilities at time, but he's surely the most technical of their Europa League-standard midfield bunch.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>The teams trot out, Liverpool in their trademark red, Arsenal in their away kit of blues various. A warm handshake between Kenny Dalglish and Arsene Wenger, who haven't always hit it off on the touchline, and we're off!</strong> Arsenal set the ball rolling, kicking towards the Kop. A <em>tempest</em> is raging.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 seconds:</strong> Downing powers down the left. Vermaelen is across to bundle the ball out for a corner. Nothing comes from the set piece, despite goal machine Martin Skrtel having lumbered up for it. Here's Steven Hughes on The Andrei Arshavin Conundrum: \"The signs were, there for those who wanted to see them, before Arsenal even bought the man. The wonderful Euro 2008 performances against the Netherlands and Sweden were then followed by a bankrupt, non-existent display against Spain in the semi-final. He went from being the East European Messi to being the proto-Stewart Downing all within the space of three games.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> A first touch for Suarez, who is booed by the Arsenal fans in front of him as he bustles down the left. He wins a corner, which is swung to the far post. Kelly meets it with his head, but sends the effort wide right. That was half a chance. Liverpool have started quite strongly here. \"Let me join the rest of the world in having an opinion on Andy Carroll,\" begs Tom Fraine. Fair enough. \"I personally think he's a slovenly lump, but this is the one game I'd have started him in. I saw him scare the bejeezus out of Arsenal at the Emirates last year (for the Magpies), and with Arsenal's dodgy central defence you'd back him to score.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Suarez bothers Vermaelen down the inside-left channel, and nearly breaks clear. Play's pulled back, the Liverpool striker being <em>this</em> much offside. But Arsenal are playing a dangerous game here, having looked shaky down their right side three times already.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Walcott, in the Liverpool box just to the right of goal, brings a long ball down wonderfully with one silky touch. Jose Enrique is over very quickly to cover before the Arsenal winger can get a shot away. This is a very open start. More, please!</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Kuyt is found free down the inside-left channel by a clever pass from Spearing. He's a blond ringlet or two offside. Arsenal are not looking totally confident at the back, but since when has that been news?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Up the other end, Walcott is proving a persistent pain. Again he traps a long ball dead, raked down the inside-right channel, and manages to get a low and hard shot on target from a tight-ish angle, ten yards out. Reina is behind it, but only just: parried low, the ball balloons up into the sky, and is then claimed by the keeper at the second attempt.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Oh dear, Stewart Downing. Suarez goes after a ball down the middle. He's clear of the Arsenal defence, but Szczesny slides out quickly to deflect the ball from Suarez's path. The ball drops to Downing, 35 yards out, with the goal gaping. Sadly for Liverpool, their \u00a320m man has none of Xabi Alonso's long-distance skills, and he misses the ball with a fresh-air swipe. Dear lord.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> It's proper komik kutz from long distance now. This time it's Sagna who makes himself look ridiculous, cutting inside from the right and taking a shot from 25 yards. The ball flies out on the left touchline, about 25 yards from the corner flag. If there was no stand to get in the way, that shot would probably have sailed through a full 360 degrees and hit Sagna on the back of his head. Professional football, we're watching here, ladies and gentlemen.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Suarez robs Song in the centre circle, and Liverpool are two on two. It's a marvellous opportunity for Liverpool, with their players travelling at pace, and the Arsenal defenders backtracking, but Suarez, moving down the inside-right channel, rolls a pass inside behind Henderson, who has to check his run and the momentum is gone.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Downing is in on goal, bombing after a flick down the inside-right channel from Kuyt. He cocks his leg to shoot from ten yards, but out of nowhere Sagna pops over to take the ball off his toe. Brilliant defending. \"Interesting to see two England wide men on the pitch,\" lies Gary Naylor. \"While Walcott continues to tantalise with glimpses of what might be, Downing merely confirms what never was. England should think about Leighton Baines as a wide man - he would be the Moneyball option.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>18 min: PENALTY! NOT THAT LIVERPOOL USUALLY BOTHER SCORING THEM!</strong> Suarez, booed mercilessly by the away fans, turns Arsenal inside out down the left with a one-two with Kuyt. Wonderful skill. He closes in on goal from a tight angle on the left, but is upended by Szczesny, sliding out feet first. Or is he? On second look, that appears a wee bit theatrical from Suarez, though there <em>might</em> have been contact before the triple salchow and pike. Still, either way, it's given.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> And it's missed! Kuyt hits a poor effort towards the bottom left. It's parried back out by Szczesny, but into the middle of the gaping goal. Henderson is coming in from deep to hammer home, but Kuyt decides to get in the way and cushion a side-foot goalwards himself. Szczesny somehow springs up and gets across to save! Stunning goalkeeping, and more penalty-based incompetence from Liverpool who, despite last weekend's shenanigans at Wembley, have been laughably poor from 12 yards this season. It's like Michael Owen never left.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>23 min: OWN GOAL! Liverpool 1-0 Arsenal.</strong> Speaing slides a peach of a pass down the right to set Henderson free. Henderson whips a low ball towards the near post. It should be easily cleared, but Koscielny slides in to flash a clearance into the bottom-right corner of the net. Dear oh dear, what a hapless shambles. All we need now are those red cards and a goal in the final minute.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>25 min: </strong> Liverpool so unlucky not to make it two here. A lovely sweeping move finds Henderson in space on the right-hand edge of the area. He sidefoots a crisp low shot towards the bottom left, but the ezxczellent Szczesny palms it out. Suarez, coming in from a tight angle on the left, hits the loose ball against the left-hand post. Not for the first time this season - in fact, for the 458th time this season - Liverpool are left shaking their heads as the woodwork vibrates. \"Jim Beglin on ESPN said Downing's chance landed on his 'weaker foot',\" reports Colm Cosgrove, \"but surely that should be 'weakest foot', seeing as both feet are useless.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>28 min: </strong> Arsenal were rocking awhile there, but seem to have settled a wee bit. It's been a very open game so far. Both sets of fans are giving it plenty.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>30 min: GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Arsenal. </strong> Liverpool are caught snoozing here. Sagna is in miles of space down the right, nobody near him at all. He has all the time he needs to swing in a perfect cross onto the head of Van Persie, on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box. Van Persie heads into the right-hand side of the net, almost in slow motion, with Liverpool's defence standing dotted around him. So simple, like a training-ground drill.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Liverpool probe down the left a couple of times, first through Downing, then Kuyt, but nothing's doing. They're seeing most of the ball, but doing little with it. That goal - which came out of nothing - has taken some of the wind from their sails. \"I think the 25th minute's Colm Cosgrove just means 'foot',\" suggests Mac Millings.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> All a bit scrappy at the moment. Spearing catches Rosicky on the shin, and is lucky to get away without a booking. \"If I ever find myself up against the wall facing a firing squad, I pray that the shooters are all wearing Liverpool shirts,\" writes Justin Kavanagh, in an email entitled \"Poor execution\".</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Liverpool are triangulating at speed in the middle of the park, but going nowhere fast. It looks pretty, though.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Suarez turns on the edge of the area, just to the left, and goes on a mazy run goalwards. It's a scintillating skedaddle, turning away from Song and beating Koscielny, Vermaelen, Song again, and Koscielny again. Suarez attempts to guide the ball across Szczesny into the bottom right corner, but the keeper - who is really on his game today - palms it round the post. That would arguably have been goal of the season had it gone in.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Arsenal have done nothing up front since their goal. But there's a sense that it's Liverpool who are getting frustrated. They really should be leading this match, but as is their way at Anfield this season, have little to show for all their efforts. \"Even as a Liverpool fan it's comforting to see the world working fairly,\" writes Niall Mullen. \"Liverpool fail to win so many games simply because of a lack of quality. It's not rocket surgery.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> There will be two added minutes of this half.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Liverpool 1-1 Arsenal.</strong> Liverpool hit the post again! Jose Enrique feeds Adam down the left. Adam fires a low ball into the six-yard box. Kuyt gets just ahead of Szczesny, and dinks the ball past the advancing keeper and towards the gaping right-hand side of the net. But the ball turns as it slowly bounces towards the goalline, and predictably hits the upright before bouncing out. A sense that Liverpool might as well give up. And that's that for the half, Liverpool stomping off down the tunnel, Arsenal wandering in for the break looking perfectly pleased with the way things have gone. And who could blame them?</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>HALF-TIME ENTERTAINMENT (for drunk children):</strong></p> <!-- Block 39 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJHGg9c86fs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJHGg9c86fs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>It's been tipping down, so here's a short cartoon about the rain. It's from the 1980s, and used to be shown on Channel 4 whenever they'd not sold enough advertising, which was always. It's spectacularly depressing, even by 1980s Channel 4 standards. The main character gets up and decides to take life by the scruff of the neck. With this in mind, he goes for a walk, but turns around at the first sight of rain, and goes back to bed, where he drinks a bottle of brandy dry. Children's television's not what it was.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> Liverpool set the ball rolling again, and they're kicking towards the Kop in this half, as is their wont. \"Liverpool might be getting frustrated, but their play has been much better than the last few weeks because of Carroll's absence,\" suggests Mike Phillips. \"It's not just his individual play that hinders Liverpool, its the way he makes the team around him play - slow, long and ponderous. Suarez and kuyt look much livlier without him. Kenny et al are just trying to save face by playing him.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Kuyt, Suarez and Henderson tippy-tap some nice one-touch stuff down the right, Suarez breaking clear down the wing. He reaches the box, but there are no options for him in the middle, and his weak shot billows the side netting. \"I am not sure where the 'Arsenal in crisis' bandwagon currently is,\" writes Liam Moseley. \"However the one thing that has struck me in this match is that Arsenal are no where near as comfortable on the ball as they used to be. The difference is really telling.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> The half stops almost as soon as it starts, Arteta having clashed accidentally with Henderson in the middle of the park. It looks something and nothing, but a concerned Suarez is over him and quickly shouting for the physio.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Arteta is currently being bundled onto the stretcher. I say bundled; obviously the medical men are taking no chances and treating him very gingerly. This will take another couple of minutes. Meanwhile, on Sky they're showing a super-slow-mo of the Suarez penalty incident in the first half. It does look like the Arsenal keeper caught him with his shin, though Suarez did make a meal of it with a fancy fling.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Arteta - formerly of Everton, let's not forget - is given a loud round of applause as he departs on the stretcher. That was a very strange incident; Arteta seemed to turn into Henderson at high speed, without realising the Liverpool player was there. He's replaced by Diaby, and given best wishes by a concerned Henderson as he leaves.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Diaby's first involvement: sending a low shot towards the bottom-right corner. Reina is behind it all the way. \"Why was Murun Buchstansanger naked?\" wonders Paul Gordon, who may as well be asking me the meaning of life. \"He was looking pretty buff for a rodent/alien with no discernible legs who spent his day in bed drinking brandy. I assume his biceps gets the same work-out I do lying in bed until two on Saturday afternoon.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> An injury update on Arteta: he took a whack to the jaw, and is suffering severe concussion. \"For all Liverpool's bleating about hitting the woodwork so often and being so unlucky, can we just be honest for a second here?\" asks Alex Till. \"Hitting the woodwork is missing the target.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Van Persie is <em>this</em> close to Suarezing past five Liverpool challenges down the inside-right channel and breaking into the box. Wonderous run. Walcott joins in as a melee ensues. Eventually Skrtel clears. Arsenal strung quite a few passes together before Van Persie went on his solo run, their first pretty patterns of the match.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Downing nearly releases Suarez into the area down the left, but his pass is too strong. Play sweeps up the other end, and Walcott gains a yard down the inside right. He's got the opportunity of a shot from the edge of the area, and takes it, but blazes wildly into the stand.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> I haven't seen him, but the Arsenal fans are singing \"What a waste of money\", so I can only assume Andy Carroll is warming up for Liverpool. I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb there.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> A ball swung into the Arsenal area from the right. Level with the far post, eight yards out, Super Striker Skrtel heads down into the six-yard box, but it's only Kelly in the middle, and the right back can't get his toe onto the ball. Szczesny gets there first, and clears out Vermaelen while he does so. Cue more treatment, though the defender will be OK by the looks of it.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Vermaelen goes in the book for sweeping Suarez's legs away from behind. No complaints.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Carragher is <em>this</em> close from Sandy Browning the ball into his own net, Rosicky dinking in a cross from the right, the Liverpool defender throwing himself at it before withdrawing his neck at the last second. \"Do you remember this thing?\" asks Rich Soden...</p> <!-- Block 53 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzkxwN63q2Y?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzkxwN63q2Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>\"Heron and crane. Many a dreadful gloomy Sunday I spent waiting for the advertised Serie A game only for a posh woman to announce (without a shade of remorse) 'And now a real treat for you as channel 4 screens the jury prize winning...'.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Downing looks to jink past (yes, really) Song down the right. He's upended. A free kick in a dangerous area. Adam scuffs possibly the worst free kick in the history of all sport into the box. It's cleared by the front man. Where have all these \u00a310m set pieces gone?</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Liverpool should be leading. Kuyt whips a majestic low ball along the corridor of uncertainty from the right. It beats all of Arsenal's defenders and the keeper, and ends up at the feet of Kelly at the far post. With the goal gaping, he manages to figure-of-eight his legs, letting the ball sail through the gap. What a miss. Liverpool are becoming brazenly profligate.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Arsenal should be leading. They carve Liverpool apart down the left. The ball's sent into the centre by Song, to the feet of Walcott, eight yards out who hits a shot goalwards. The ball takes a couple of deflections, pinballing off Skrtel and Carragher, and looks to have wrongfooted Reina, who is diving to his right as the ball goes to his left. The keeper flings a foot out, and stops brilliantly. How did that stay out?</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Gervinho replaces Benayoun. \"Clearly the finest piece of Russian animation was <a href=\"http://youtu.be/J6oyVvLDO8w\">the Russian version of Itchy and Scratchy</a>,\" writes Rajiv, of the majestic Worker &amp; Parasite.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Downing races clear down the left. He's got Suarez in the middle, waiting to sidefoot home, so he passes the ball straight into Szczesny's arms. \"I bet that Henderson and Downing heard the waste-of-money chant,\" begins Steven Hughes, \"pulled their collars away from their throats with their index fingers, before sighing with relief as they saw Carroll (luke)warming up on the sideline.\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> It's pretty loud at Anfield. With that fourth-place finish in mind, Arsenal could do with the three points; Liverpool unquestionably need them. Expect a fiery finish.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Downing latches onto a loose ball on the edge of the Arsenal area, and screws a hapless shot miles wide right.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Walcott gets his head on a long ball, but can only flick it on to Reina. Arsenal aren't doing much up front; they'll be much the happier should this end a draw. \"Is this Heron vs. Crane like Alien vs. Predator?\" wonders Paul Gordon. \"Whatever it is, I'm thoroughly enjoying the dulcet tones of the Russian commentator. Like a Cossack Simon Brotherton.\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> A final change by Arsenal. Oxlade-Chamberlain comes on for the substitute Diaby. \"Isn't Wenger risking the wrath of the Belgian FA by forcing Vermaelen to play the full 90?\" wonders the tinder-dry Charles Hamilton.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Jose Enrique sprays a lovely ball from the left wing to Henderson, just to the right of the Arsenal goal, ten yards out. Henderson should surely send a volley whistling goalwards, but the confidence-free midfielder attempts to find Suarez in the middle with a cushioned, sidefooted pass, and the chance is gone. Liverpool get their 13th corner of the match out of this - Arsenal, let the records show, have none - but nothing comes of it.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Adam has the ball, 35 yards from goal. Henderson is free on the right, screaming to be put clean through. Adam elects to spin round and round - 360 degrees, 720 degrees, and so on - like a dog preparing for beddy-byes, or Scott Parker. The pass is never made. Very poor from Liverpool's playmaker.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> \"As a Liverpool fan,\" begins Bryan Coleman, \"I just want to express my frustration. We would be 4-1 up if any of our players could put the ball in the bloody net. I don't really know why I'm still watching - the Arsenal winner is surely on the way. Groundhog Day.\" To cheer you up, here's a great stat nicked from Sky: Steven Gerrard has yet to be on the winning side in a Premier League match this season.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Downing is replaced by Bellamy. Shouldn't this change have been made earlier? Anything between 87 and 89 minutes earlier?</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Kuyt explodes into an uncharacteristic hot funk over an offside decision. \"@\u00a3%^@$%$^!@,\" he tells the linesman. \"@&amp;*^%\u00a3*&amp;^@%$!!!!\" The referee gives him a stern talking to.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be <em>eight</em> added minutes of this. \"Just to show commentators are clueless everywhere in the world, not just England, the Dutch commentator just called Downing 'a stylistic player with a fine technique',\" writes the wonderfully named xcxcbbbn nbxnxnx. Are you related to Wojciech Szczesny?</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>90 min +1:</strong> A ball from the left pulled into the Arsenal area for Kuyt. The Liverpool striker falls to the ground, with Koscielny nearby. It's no penalty, though the Kop scream for one. Why bother? They'd only miss it. \"After forgetting about the game and becoming engrossed in Heron and Crane, I've come to the conclusion that this wacky pair are the Soviet equivalent of Ross and Rachel,\" writes Paul Gordon. \"I smell a sitcom.\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>90 min +2: WHAT A GOAL! Liverpool 1-2 Arsenal.</strong> Wow. This is some finish. Song chips a ball down the inside-left channel. Van Persie's after it. He's onside, and hammers an unstoppable shot past Reina at the keeper's near post. The keeper had no chance. That was simply brilliant.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>90 min +3:</strong> Spearing is replaced by Carroll. \"Steven Gerrard has yet to be on the winning side in a Premier League game this season?\" splutters Rob Marriott. \"Can I be one of the 1,057 pedants who saw him score the winner against Newcastle a couple of months back?\" Serves me right for parrotting someone else's research.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>90 min +4:</strong> Gibbs has a dig from tight on the left, but nothing's really happening for him.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>90 min +5:</strong> This is Liverpool's bid for fourth place out the window, you'd have to say. Unless they score twice in the next three minutes. Which, well, you know.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>90 min +6:</strong> Van Persie shakes in from the left, nipping past a couple of challenges and rolling the ball inside to Oxlade-Chamberlain, who unleashes a rising fizzer just wide of the top-right corner. Magnificent attempt.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>90 min +7:</strong> Liverpool's unbeaten home record is about to come to an end. They've only won two of the last ten now. \"I love the contrast between 90 min +2 and then 90 min +3,\" sighs Daniel French. \"Uninspiring to say the least.\"</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Liverpool 1-2 Arsenal.</strong> And that's it! Robin van Persie has won the day for the visitors. Liverpool carved out most of the chances, but what's the point if you do little or nothing with them? They missed a penalty, fannied around quite a lot, and were punished by brilliance. Liverpool director of football, or whatever he is, Damien Comolli says there'll be no major signings in the summer. If that's the case, Liverpool are going nowhere, and quickly to boot. Arsenal, on the other hand, are still dreaming of next year's Champions League, and possibly finishing above Spurs, the way things are going. The final word to Philip Podolsky, albeit about iron-curtain cartoons: \"The dulcet voice in the Soviet cartoon belongs to one Innokenty Smoktunovsky, basically the Soviet Laurence Olivier. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cX7_P_ociI&amp;feature=related\">This version of Hamlet</a> is worth looking up for Shostakovitch's wonderful score alone.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Passengers travelling through the Channel tunnel will be able to use their mobile phones 250ft under the seabed from July after a breakthrough in signal technology. Eurotunnel, which manages the 23-mile link between Folkestone and Calais, has reportedly announced a deal with four mobile providers, including France T\u00e9l\u00e9com Orange and Free Mobile. The deal comes after the French technology group Alcatel-Lucent worked out how to link an undersea tunnel with mobile signals for the first time. A spokesman for Eric Besson, the French industry minister, said that the new 3G and 2G enabled system would go live in July, in time for the London Olympics. The deal between Eurotunnel and the mobile providers will officially be signed next month, according to reports. The Channel tunnel has, since it opened in 1994, been one of the few places where people can enjoy some mobile-free silence. But advances in technology have seen signals penetrate underground, with users already able to use their mobiles on the deepest parts of the Paris metro. Last year, plans to enable passengers to use their mobile phones while travelling on the tube in London were shelved owing to funding. Earlier this week Eurotunnel announced that it had returned to profit in 2011 after it drew a record 19 million passengers, while the Queen's Jubilee and the Olympics will boost this year's performance. The operator, which runs its own car, coach and truck services, said the new peak came as it grabbed a bigger share of the declining car crossings market and Eurostar saw a 2% hike in travellers. The company was also boosted by a 14% rise in rail freight and a \u20ac29m (\u00a324.5m) insurance payout following a fire in 2008. It made a post-tax profit of \u20ac11m in 2011 compared with a \u20ac58m loss the previous year. It also announced that it would speed up trains by 10mph to 100mph for the Olympics to cut crossing times to 30 minutes to manage increase in passengers.",

      "bodyText": "Ellen Gandy, Hannah Miley and Francesca Halsall got off to an impressive start on the first morning of the British Gas Swimming Championships, though the real star of the show might have been the venue itself. Stratford's Aquatics Centre played host to its first test event last month \u2013 the Fina Diving World Cup \u2013 but this was the first competition to take place in the Olympic swimming pool. First impressions were overwhelmingly positive. \"Beautiful,\" was the verdict of Gandy, who won silver in the 200m butterfly at last year's world championships and posted the second-fastest qualifying time in the same event here. \"The whole park looks amazing.\" Miley \u2013 a European and Commonwealth champion in 2010, as well as a silver medallist last year \u2013 went one better in the 400m individual medley, recording the fastest time in that discipline. \"Awesome,\" she said of the venue. \"It's a lot different to my little four-lane, 25m pool back home.\" A fair bit faster, too. British Swimming's performance director, Michael Scott, had predicted this year's championships \u2013 which are doubling up as Team GB's selection event for London 2012 \u2013 would be the most fiercely contested ever, but even he might not have anticipated a tempo like this quite so early in the competition. Gandy was 0.01sec outside the Olympic A standard qualifying time for her event, while Miley was well within it. \"I didn't expect it to be that quick,\" said Miley after finishing in 4min 39.49sec. \"I was expecting a 42 or a 43, so to see a 39 was unexpected. But it felt really good and I'm really happy \u2013 especially seeing the other heats beforehand: they were a lot quicker than I had anticipated.\" That could be attributed, in part, to the presence of international competition. The British athletes will compete in separate finals \u2013 with the top two finishers in each event securing their Olympic place, as long as they meet the qualifying requirement \u2013 but they were made to swim against a broader field in the qualifying rounds. Gandy had been beaten into second place by Sweden's Sarah Sjoestroem. Halsall was just behind both, in third place. \"I know the other swimmers probably had a fast heat because it's the only chance they have to race us Brits here,\" said Gandy, who arrived in Britain from her training base in Australia last Wednesday. \"So, yeah, that was a bit faster than I meant to go this morning. But there's no point holding back and it was just a case of clearing out the cobwebs and getting the first race under your belt.\" The swimmers were backed by a cheerful, if not especially vociferous, home crowd. Perhaps the presence of so many competing home athletes made it hard to rally behind a favourite, but a more boisterous atmosphere was expected on Saturday night, a session involving several finals. British Swimming reported that the full allocation of 2,500 tickets for each session had been sold, though there were plenty of empty seats visible. For many spectators, though, the real thrill will have been seeing this venue in action. That much was certainly true for Seb Coe, checking on proceedings during the morning session. \"I can't really divorce what I've seen here from what I was trying to sell eight years ago to the IOC,\" he said. \"I was basically standing in a tower block about half a mile from here and trying to explain to the IOC that 'you see where that 50-foot mountain of rotting fridges is? We're going to put an aquatics centre there.' \"I felt like a slightly dodgy Spanish timeshare salesman. So it's not really having got it to this point \u2013 it's having removed 80,000 tonnes of contaminated soil and replaced it with 120,000 tonnes of clean soil, having dealt with the archaeological find of three skeletons under the site and to have created something that is really what we consider to be the gateway to the park.\" He was keen to emphasis the legacy impact, too, of the Zaha Hadid-designed venue, the stylish interior of which will be matched by an equally impressive exterior once the two temporary wings of Olympic seating have been removed. \"It was really important that we made this the iconic venue in the park,\" he said. \"Post the Games, it's going to look even better because we'll lose the 15 and a half thousand extra seats in the wings and you'll get a much better feel for the sweep [of the roof].\" In the meantime, the hope is that the legacy of the forthcoming week of competition can be medals at London 2012.",

      "body": "<p>Ellen Gandy, Hannah Miley and Francesca Halsall got off to an impressive start on the first morning of the British Gas Swimming Championships, though the real star of the show might have been the venue itself. Stratford's Aquatics Centre played host to its first test event last month \u2013 the Fina Diving World Cup \u2013 but this was the first competition to take place in the Olympic swimming pool. First impressions were overwhelmingly positive.</p> <p>\"Beautiful,\" was the verdict of Gandy, who won silver in the 200m butterfly at last year's world championships and posted the second-fastest qualifying time in the same event here. \"The whole park looks amazing.\" Miley \u2013 a European and Commonwealth champion in 2010, as well as a silver medallist last year \u2013 went one better in the 400m individual medley, recording the fastest time in that discipline. \"Awesome,\" she said of the venue. \"It's a lot different to my little four-lane, 25m pool back home.\"</p> <p>A fair bit faster, too. British Swimming's performance director, Michael Scott, had predicted this year's championships \u2013 which are doubling up as Team GB's selection event for London 2012 \u2013 would be the most fiercely contested ever, but even he might not have anticipated a tempo like this quite so early in&#xa0;the competition. Gandy was 0.01sec outside the Olympic A standard qualifying time for her event, while Miley was well within it.</p> <p>\"I didn't expect it to be that quick,\" said Miley after finishing in 4min 39.49sec. \"I was expecting a 42 or a 43, so to see a 39 was unexpected. But it felt&#xa0;really good and I'm really happy \u2013 especially seeing the other heats beforehand: they were a lot quicker than I had&#xa0;anticipated.\"</p> <p>That could be attributed, in part, to the presence of international competition. The British athletes will compete in separate finals \u2013 with the top two finishers in each event securing their Olympic place, as long as they meet the qualifying requirement \u2013 but they were made to swim against a broader field in the qualifying rounds. Gandy had been beaten into second place by Sweden's Sarah Sjoestroem. Halsall was just behind both, in third place.</p> <p>\"I know the other swimmers probably had a fast heat because it's the only chance they have to race us Brits here,\" said Gandy, who arrived in Britain from her training base in Australia last Wednesday. \"So, yeah, that was a bit faster than I meant to go this morning. But there's no point holding back and it was just a case of clearing out the cobwebs and getting the first race under your belt.\"</p> <p>The swimmers were backed by a cheerful, if not especially vociferous, home crowd. Perhaps the presence of so many competing home athletes made it hard to rally behind a favourite, but a more boisterous atmosphere was expected on Saturday night, a session involving several finals. British Swimming reported that the full allocation of 2,500 tickets for each session had been sold, though there were plenty of empty seats visible.</p> <p>For many spectators, though, the real thrill will have been seeing this venue in action. That much was certainly true for Seb Coe, checking on proceedings during the morning session. \"I can't really divorce what I've seen here from what I was trying to sell eight years ago to the IOC,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I was basically standing in a tower block about half a mile from here and trying to explain to the IOC that 'you see where that 50-foot mountain of rotting fridges is?

But as the Paris shows draw to a close on Wednesday, the eyes of the fashion world are on one 49-year-old woman. She's pale, long-haired and lanky. And with the type of hats she favours, they're all hoping they won't be sitting behind her. Anna Dello Russo has swiftly become a huge draw for fashion photographers. As one blogger breathlessly put it: \"No one is more inspiring and creative in fashion right now.\" Described by Helmut Newton as a \"fashion maniac\", Dello Russo \u2013 or \"ADR\" as she styles herself \u2013 worked on Vogue Italia for 18 years before editing L'Uomo Vogue between 2000 and 2006. She is now editor at large and creative consultant for Vogue Japan. She was spotted in 2006 by street style blogger Scott Schulman of The Sartorialist, who turned her into a phenomenon. Widely regarded as the woman who likes to wear the most outlandish catwalk creations as everyday outfits, Dello Russo says: \"I like to wear evening outfits in the sunlight.\" She is seen as the Lady Gaga of fashion, with traditionally jaded fashionistas rubbernecking to catch a glimpse of her latest outfits. For the recent launch of Victoria Beckham's autumn/winter 2012 collection at Harvey Nichols, she wore a headband that looked like an Afro of silver bubbles. It also had a veil. At the Marni show in Milan she wore a Balenciaga wimple and was the first to be seen wearing a pair of Prada's much-coveted \"flame\" shoes from this season's 1950s kitsch collection. (Dello Russo has another 4,000 pairs at home.) Last week she was spotted wearing a Jil Sander beanie hat \u2013 also with a veil. Editor-in-chief of Grazia Jane Bruton has been tweeting pictures of Dello Russo in various eccentric garbs and declares her \"wonderfully uplifting\". Grazia has written of her as a \"style stuntwoman who could give Superman some lessons on how to do a quick change\". Bruton said: \"What I love most about Anna Dello Russo is her spirit and sense of fun. She exudes a genuine love for fashion, and every time I see her on the front row with giant grapes on her head, or a policemen's helmet teamed with a Balmain dress, she lifts my spirits instantly. ADR doesn't just get dressed, she transforms herself every morning into a fashion idol, and we love her for it, especially in these gloomy economic times. \"One of our favourite phrases in the Grazia office is 'What would Anna Dello Russo do\u2026' She's inspiring \u2013 OK, most of us aren't going to go out in a lime-green feather coat teamed with a watermelon fascinator, but we might add feather earrings or a mad pair of heels to an outfit and feel a little tingle of ADR fashion fabulousness as a result.\" Dello Russo's visual impact gives her a global appeal. Mexican fashionista Hector Mucharrazcorrect writes: \"I love ADR. I love her style, uniqueness and will to wear whatever she wants. She wears couture exactly as it appears on the runway and she pulls it off.\" Dello Russo was the first major-league fashion editor to embrace digital media. Her own chaotic, maximalist blog appears in English and Japanese. It has a full archive of everything she wears to events, including credits for hair and makeup. She has turned from an oddity to a figure of fascination. At the \"Irreverent Dinner\" hosted in Paris last year by Carine Roitfeld, the former editor in chief of Vogue Paris, Dello Russo wore her most extraordinary headgear yet: a gigantic red swan with a sequinned beak sprouted angrily out of the top of her head, flapping a 6ft wing span in its wake. She is pleasingly self-aware. \"Where I'm from [south Italy], eccentricity is alive. People have great taste and love colour. When I was young there were religious parades in the street, like carnivals. The powerful expression impressed me.\" Her catchphrase? \"I don't want to be cool. I want to be fashion.\"",

In the age of the Occupy Wall Street movement that has popularised the concept of the 99% and demonised the activities of the elite 1%, no wonder such a story has a strong pull for the American public. Of course, this is fantasy, not reality. While American politicians show little real sign of exacting much meaningful punishment on Wall Street bankers and the hyper-rich, the same cannot be said for US television, in the form of the new hit show, Revenge. The ABC series, which began in the autumn, has won an audience of millions with a story that is aimed at bringing down at least one family of \"one percenters\". They are the Graysons, embodied by the evil matriarch of the clan, Victoria, played by the actress Madeleine Stowe. They live an exalted life of wealth and snobbery in the Hamptons area of Long Island, which has long been the playground for New York's elite. Victoria's husband, Conrad, is chief executive of the distinctly capitalist-sounding Grayson Global. Their nemesis is Emily Thorne, played by Emily VanCamp, whose innocent father was sent to jail by the Graysons, and who returns to the Hamptons incognito to wreak her revenge. But, in a time of hesitant recovery from the Great Recession, many are seeing the story as a 99% versus 1% narrative. \"The Graysons themselves do stand in for the 1%. They are so extremely venal,\" said Jace Lacob, a television columnist for Newsweek. Yet, bad as the Graysons are, the methods Thorne employs to exact revenge are extreme, from computer hacking to arson. Blood is spilled and people die. It is a long way from the tradition of camp American TV dramas such as Dallas, Dynasty and daytime soap operas, where the rich and their lifestyles are to be aspired to, not destroyed. \"The show reveals the downside of wealth and materialism. These are people who are morally corrupt. It is a takedown of the ruling class,\" said Lacob. Others go further, seeing Thorne as a cipher for the frustrations and unhappiness of ordinary Americans. \"There is a little bit of Emily in all of us,\" said Richard Laermer, a celebrity expert and head of RLM, a public relations company. Nor is Revenge alone as a new drama with a political undertone. Ringer, another TV series, features one twin from a poor background assuming the identity of her identical sister, who is wealthy and has a summer house in\u2026 yes, you guessed it, the Hamptons. The twin, Bridget Kelly, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, has to navigate the morally dubious, twisted ways of her dead sister's elite social life. Then there is GCB, a new comedy drama that explores the shallow social mores of a group of wealthy Texan socialites. The heroine has fallen on hard economic times and as a result has become a better person. Roseanne Barr, whose hit 1990s sitcom Roseanne was a rare primetime depiction of American working-class life, is meanwhile producing a pilot for Downwardly Mobile, a show where she plays the boss of a mobile-home park full of the economic casualties of the Great Recession. However, if American audiences are showing a sudden political edge in their viewing, it is not one that extends to their foreign TV viewing habits. While Revenge may be a surrogate for the anger of the 99% at the American economic elite, viewers are at the same time big fans of Downton Abbey, which has become a huge hit in America. Revelling in class warfare and rooting against the 1%, it seems, is something reserved for the current moment in their homeland. Or to put it another way, no one watching these shows was kicked out of their home or lost their jobs due to the actions of a British aristocrat. Thus an American audience can enjoy and admire the goings-on at Downton. \"The rise of Downton has happened because it is trapped in amber at a specific moment in time. There is a safe distance,\" said Lacob. The same cannot be said for a drama featuring super-rich Americans or powerful financiers. In popular culture, at least, some American viewers are now out for a little payback.",

      "bodyText": "At least five US military personnel could face a disciplinary review following the burning of copies of the Qur'an by American soldiers in Afghanistan. A joint investigation by senior Afghan and US military officials has concluded that although mistakes were made when troops at Bagram airbase, near Kabul, had burned copies of the Qur'an and other religious literature along with piles of waste paper, there was no intent to desecrate the Islamic religious texts. A western official said the investigation could lead to a disciplinary review of at least five US military personnel involved. But a different panel appointed by the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, to investigate the incident, has concluded that the burning of the holy books was deliberate. Maulvi Khaliq Dad, a senior Afghan religious leader on the panel, said US troops told Afghans at the base that the religious materials pulled from a detention centre library were to be stored, but were then sent for incineration. \"They are claiming that it was not intentional. Our investigative team says it was intentional,\" Dad said. After the panel presented its findings, Afghanistan's top religious leaders demanded on Friday that those involved be put on public trial and be punished, a position that Karzai backs. Barack Obama and other US officials have apologised for the incident on 20 February, which triggered six days of riots across Afghanistan. The apologies, which described the incineration as accident, have failed to quell the anger in the country, although the violent protests that killed more than 30 Afghans and six US troops have subsided. Karzai's office said on Saturday it had only seen the report drafted by the religious leaders and had not yet been given the joint report, so could not comment on it. \"We are waiting for the result of the investigation by Nato, which will probably show who is involved in this and how many people are involved. After studying it we will announce our stance,\" said a presidential spokesman, Aimal Faizi. \"What the Afghan president has requested from US officials and the US military is a trial and punishment.\"",

      "bodyText": "As Republicans head to the polls this Tuesday for a potentially decisive round of voting in their party's topsy-turvy nomination race, many Democrats are increasingly optimistic that President Barack Obama will secure a second term. Even if \"Super Tuesday\" delivers a long sought-after victory for frontrunner Mitt Romney, some observers believe the drawn-out battle for his party's nomination has seen the Republican party drift so far to the right that it has catastrophically damaged its election chances. At the same time, the US economy has started gearing up into a full recovery, shaving down once spiralling jobless numbers, sending stocks soaring and giving consumers a much-needed boost of confidence. \"In Washington Democrats are feeling better and better every day about the election in November,\" said Larry Haas, a political commentator and former aide in the Clinton White House. Indeed, a flurry of commentary has appeared in recent days, from figures on both left and right, speculating about what an Obama second term might look like in terms of policy. The current contrast between the two parties' fortunes was amply illustrated last week, when Romney managed to eke out a narrow win in his own home state of Michigan against a conservative challenge from former senator Rick Santorum. Romney, who gave an embarrassing speech to a virtually empty stadium in Detroit, was hobbled by his opposition to a bailout that helped save Michigan's car industry. Meanwhile, Obama was speaking to a raucous, cheering crowd of car workers at a union convention. \"I placed my bet on the American worker!\" Obama said, claiming the political spoils from a bailout that some estimate saved more than a million jobs. The last poll to measure who would win Michigan in a match-up between Romney and Obama left little doubt who is ahead. It put Obama up by a whopping 18 points, crushing Michigan-born Romney by 51% to 33% in a state that some saw as a potential 2012 battleground. Other polling news from swing states is also grim. In the key state of Pennsylvania, Obama leads Romney by 11 points. In Virginia, Obama is up by six points against Romney. Such polling probably reflects how many independent voters \u2013 the key middle-ground of presidential politics \u2013 have been put off by the increasingly bitter Republican race. Romney has been unable to finish off determined challenges from Santorum, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Texan congressman Ron Paul. The race has become highly negative and obsessed with social issues such as contraception. To many experts all the candidates now appear damaged goods as their rivals hammer away at their weaknesses and past scandals. \"So far the Republican primary is like watching The Exorcist. Each candidate is trying but failing to get rid of their demons,\" said Professor Matthew Hale, a political scientist at Seton Hall University. It is possible that Romney might secure a vital win on Super Tuesday, when ten different states vote, but it is not guaranteed. If Santorum wins the key fight of Ohio and performs as strongly as expected in conservative strongholds such as Georgia, Oklahoma and Tennessee, then already pervasive doubts over Romney's candidacy will grow. There is a strong underground whispering campaign among many senior Republican figures to try to persuade an outside candidate to act as a \"white knight\" to try to save the party. None has yet come forward, but names such as former Florida governor Jeb Bush, New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Indiana governor Mitch Daniels are those most frequently whirring through the Washington rumour mill. But even if Romney does become the party's nominee, there are grave doubts as to what sort of figure he will be. The relentless attacks of his party rivals and a series of gaffes on the campaign trail have reinforced an image of a wealthy elitist with little sense of how ordinary Americans live their lives. That is not an image likely to be an easy sell to an electorate still scarred from the recession, but one that is also now embracing an economic recovery. Figures last week showed that US jobless numbers had fallen to levels not seen in almost four years. At the same time the US stock exchange has roared back, topping the 13,000 level. US firms are hiring workers and sitting on vast cash reserves. \"Six months ago, a lot of Democrats were really worried. Most Democrats thought Obama would lose,\" said Haas. Now they are methodically building a powerful election machine to tout the recovering economy and attack the Republicans. Obama has visited more than 100 fundraising events for his re-election effort, bringing in a staggering $140m for his campaign war chest.",

      "bodyText": "Manchester City will start talks with David Silva regarding a new contract at the end of the season, though the Spaniard has signalled the deal may not be a foregone conclusion. Silva signed a four-year contract when he joined City in 2010 for \u00a326m and Roberto Mancini, the club's manager, said: \"We won't have a problem with David. He has two more years on his contract and I don't think that is an issue. It is important that after May we need to start talks over a new contract for him.\" However Silva told the Daily Telegraph: \"I've got two more years left on my contract here. I'm very happy and I am going to see them through. After that, who knows? Football is a changeable game, from one day to another, everything could change. I only see myself at the moment as where I am and that is at City.\" Mancini, meanwhile, has compared Mario Balotelli to a young Wayne Rooney: \"Maybe Rooney was like Mario at 21. He [Rooney] is more mature than Mario now. There are few players in the Euros who can do what Mario can. Outside the pitch, Mario is normal and clever and perfect.\" Mancini added that Carlos Tevez is at least \"two weeks\" away meaning the Argentinian will no longer be considered for next week's trip to Swansea City as had been initially thought. When Tevez does return Mancini is adamant he will not disrupt City and the manager also believes he could play alongside Balotelli and Sergio Agu\u00ebro in what would be a formidable attack. \"Agu\u00ebro, Balotelli and Tevez could all play together. We would have to work very hard but they could play together,\" Mancini said.",

      "body": "<p>Manchester City will start talks with David Silva regarding a new contract at the end of the season, though the Spaniard has signalled the deal may not be a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>Silva signed a four-year contract when he joined City in 2010 for \u00a326m and Roberto Mancini, the club's manager, said: \"We won't have a problem with David. He has two more years on his contract and I don't think that is an issue. It is important that after May we need to start talks over a new contract for him.\"</p> <p>However Silva told the Daily Telegraph: \"I've got two more years left on my contract here. I'm very happy and I am going to see them through. After that, who knows? Football is a changeable game, from one day to another, everything could change. I only see myself at the moment as where I am and that is at City.\"</p> <p>Mancini, meanwhile, has compared Mario Balotelli to a young Wayne Rooney: \"Maybe Rooney was like Mario at 21. He [Rooney] is more mature than Mario now. There are few players in the Euros who can do what Mario can. Outside the pitch, Mario is normal and clever and perfect.\"</p> <p>Mancini added that Carlos Tevez is at least \"two weeks\" away meaning the Argentinian will no longer be considered for next week's trip to Swansea City as had been initially thought. When Tevez does return Mancini is adamant he will not disrupt City and the manager also believes he could play alongside Balotelli and Sergio Agu\u00ebro in what would be a formidable attack. \"Agu\u00ebro, Balotelli and Tevez could all play together. We would have to work very hard but they could play together,\" Mancini said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Forty-five years after proclaiming the breakaway Republic of Biafra, former rebel-leader Emeka Ojukwu was this week given a state burial by the Nigerian government. It is unusual that the president of a country attends the funeral of a man who tried to engineer that country's breakup. But Ojukwu is being hailed as a hero today because many in Nigeria simply believe the man had a point. Many Nigerians are unhappy with the way their country has turned out. And some, just like Ojukwu in the 1960s, are now questioning the viability of the state in itself. In 2005, the CIA published a report warning that Nigeria, the seventh most populous country in the world, could disintegrate within 15 years. At the time, that prediction was dismissed by most Nigerians as baseless alarmism. But recent events have prompted a re-evaluation of that gloomy forecast. The northern-based Boko Haram Islamists are currently wreaking havoc in Nigeria, ramping up their terrorist attacks and demanding that Sharia law be implemented throughout a country where roughly half the population is Christian. Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, while southern Nigeria is largely Christian. Boko Haram have said that those originally from the south who are now living in the north should return to where they came from or face death. In response, some southern leaders have threatened retaliation against the northerners living in their region. Nigeria is currently experiencing a surge in ethnic animosity fuelled by the sectarian violence, which the central government has been incapable of quelling. President Goodluck Jonathan recently described the present situation as \"worse than during the [1967-70] civil war\". In January, Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka said that Nigeria is \"already progressing towards a defacto break up.\" Nigeria is the result of a 1914 British colonial decision to lump together more than 250 ethnic groups, differing in culture and social structure. In 1967, the eastern part of the country, dominated by the Igbo ethnic group, announced secession under then Colonel Ojukwu after a pogrom of Igbos living in the north. But the central government eventually battled the breakaway republic into submission at the cost of more than 1 million lives. That laid to rest any ideas of dividing Nigeria at the time, but today a growing number of voices are saying that a breakup would be the best solution for the people living in its territory. \"What's the point of keeping the country together when it is clearly not working? Only the northern elites wants one Nigeria, and that's because their region lacks natural resources while there is plenty of oil in the south,\" a friend of mine from the south told me recently. \"If Yugoslavia and Sudan could break up, then why can't we?\" he added. Many Nigerians from the south feel the north, where education levels are much lower, brings precious little to the nation's table in terms of resources and human capital, yet its elites consume a huge chunk of the national budget due to their political influence. Why not engineer a peaceful breakup and let new nations build more functional political entities with rulers who share the same values as their citizens? It sounds simple enough. But on reflection, the belief of a breakup improving things is based on false premises. The first of these is that there is a viable configuration under which Nigeria could split today in a peaceful manner. In reality, a simple north-south divide or even a north-east-west divide simply won't fly. In the winner-takes-all mentality that pervades modern-day Nigerian society, no ethnic group will want to accept the role of \"second fiddle\" in a new entity: we would be talking of at least six, maybe even 10 new countries. How many would be able to survive? Are conflicts between them not inevitable, such as between Ethiopia and Eritrea? The post-Yugoslavian states could count on the EU for help. Post-Nigerian states would have no such luxury. Secondly, the idea of unity even within the same ethnic group is overly idealistic. There are sub-groups and sub-groups of sub-groups within each of Nigeria's tribes. Take away a common enemy to unite them and chaos could ensue. There would also likely be a battle for control of the oil, which is mostly located in the southern Niger Delta region. This could spark a long-lasting Congo-like conflict. Nigeria's political scene today is controlled by men commonly referred to as \"godfathers,\" a handful of rich and powerful figures who hand-pick candidates for all the significant political offices in the country, ensuring their victory through bribes, threats and, if necessary, murder. When their \"boy,\" as such a protege is called, gets into office, he repays his godfather for the \"investment\" made in him through bogus contracts and a host of other means. He is also obliged to turn a blind eye to any criminal activity that his godfather, or those he protects, might commit. This system functions in all areas of Nigeria \u2013 north and south alike. So what would the creation of new countries change? Secession will not alter the situation of the average Nigerian. Fingering religious or ethnic differences as the root of Nigeria's problems oversimplifies the situation. The most immediate problem is the godfathers' stranglehold on power. The people of Nigeria will not know freedom until they can unite against this menance and the corruption it brings, much as they did in forcing the British colonialists to relinquish power five decades ago. Otherwise the outcome of a breakup would simply be smaller, weaker nations governed by systems no less corrupt and dysfunctional than today. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "Syria is still preventing the Red Cross from reaching thousands of stranded civilians in Homs as government troops continue shelling several areas of the city. Opposition activists reported heavy mortar and machine gun fire in the districts of Jobar, Khaldiyeh, Bab Sbaa, Khader and Qusoor early on Saturday. Syrian Network for Human Rights said forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were bombarding Jobar, where thousands of civilians have taken refuge after fleeing from the neighbouring Baba Amr, \"in an act of pure revenge\". \"Assad's army has been firing mortar rounds and 500mm machine guns since this morning at Jobar. We have no immediate reports of casualties because of the difficulty of communications,\" it said in a statement. Abu Hassan al-Homsi, a doctor at a makeshift clinic in Khaldiyeh district, said he treated a dozen wounded people. \"This has become routine, the mortars start falling early in the morning,\" he said. The shelling comes amid a standoff between the Syrian regime and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which says authorities have prevented its convoy from delivering badly needed food, medical supplies and blankets to thousands of people still stranded in Baba Amr, the rebel-held district of Homs that was overrun by troops on Thursday. The Red Cross said it was still negotiating access for its seven trucks, as well as Red Crescent ambulances. \"The ICRC and Syrian Red Crescent are not yet in Baba Amro today. We are still in negotiations with authorities in order to enter Baba Amro. It is important that we enter today. We are not about to give up,\" an ICRC spokesman, Hicham Hassan, told Reuters on Saturday. The refusal to allow the convoy in to treat and evacuate the wounded came as western diplomats received the bodies of Sunday Times journalist Marie Colvin and French photographer R\u00e9mi Ochlik, who were killed in an attack on a press centre in Baba Amr more than a week ago. A Reuters witness said the diplomats, believed to be the French ambassador to Syria, Eric Chevalier, and a representative from the Polish embassy, which is managing US affairs in Syria, had taken the bodies from the Al-Assad University Hospital in Damascus. The French journalist Edith Bouvier, who was badly wounded in the same attack, arrived back in France on Friday with her colleague William Daniels. The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said on Friday that he had received \"grisly reports\" of Assad's forces arbitrarily executing, imprisoning and torturing people in Homs after the rebel Free Syrian Army withdrew from the city. Anti-Assad activists have accused Syrian troops of burning houses, arresting all males over 12 and of extrajudicial killings, including the alleged beheadings of 17 men captured after Baba Amr's fall. The wounded British photographer Paul Conroy, who escaped from Homs earlier this week, said he had witnessed Syrian troops carrying out a massacre in the district. Elsewhere in Syria, state media said two people had been killed in a suicide car bomb attack in the city of Daraa, known as the birthplace of the country's uprising. The Sana state news agency said the bombing occurred at a roundabout in the central Daraa al-Balad district of the city, causing multiple casualties and damaging buildings. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least two people were killed and several others wounded in the explosion \u2013 the first suicide bombing attack on an opposition stronghold. The charity Save the Children on Saturday called for more international pressure to be brought on Syria to stop the fighting, to ensure aid agencies could help the thousands of children caught up in the conflict. Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said: \"We know children have already lost their lives, and others have been badly wounded. Children in Syria will be deeply scarred by their experiences and need urgent help. \"We need people around the world to join us in calling for an immediate end to the violence so we can get urgent help to children in Syria.\" France said on Friday it is closing its embassy in Syria. The US and Britain have already closed their embassies. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, called the events in Syria a scandal, adding that the European Council \"condemned in the harshest terms what is happening in Syria\". The west has stepped up its criticism of Assad's regime amid mounting reports of atrocities by his security forces. The US has called for him to step down and the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has said he could be considered a war criminal.",

      "bodyText": "The scientist who has borne the full brunt of attacks by climate change deniers, including death threats and accusations of misappropriating funds, is set to hit back. Michael E. Mann, creator of the \"hockey stick\" graph that illustrates recent rapid rises in global temperatures, is to publish a book next month detailing the \"disingenuous and cynical\" methods used by those who have tried to disprove his findings. The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars is a startling depiction of a scientist persecuted for trying to tell the truth. Among the tactics used against Mann were the theft and publication, in 2009, of emails he had exchanged with climate scientist Professor Phil Jones of East Anglia University. Selected, distorted versions of these emails were then published on the internet in order to undermine UN climate talks due to begin in Copenhagen a few weeks later. These negotiations ended in failure. The use of those emails to kill off the climate talks was \"a crime against humanity, a crime against the planet,\" says Mann, a scientist at Penn State University. In his book, Mann warns that \"public discourse has been polluted now for decades by corporate-funded disinformation \u2013 not just with climate change but with a host of health, environmental and societal threats.\" The implications for the planet are grim, he adds. Mann became a target of climate deniers' hate because his research revealed there has been a recent increase of almost 1\u00b0C across the globe, a rise that was unprecedented \"during at least the last 1,000 years\" and which has been linked to rising emissions of carbon dioxide from cars, factories and power plants. Many other studies have since supported this finding although climate change deniers still reject his conclusions. Mann's research particularly infuriated deniers after it was used prominently by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in one of its assessment reports, making him a target of right-wing denial campaigners. But as the 46-year-old scientist told the Observer, he only entered this research field by accident. \"I was interested in variations in temperatures of the oceans over the past millennium. But there are no records of these changes so I had to find proxy measures: coral growth, ice cores and tree rings.\" By studying these he could trace temperature fluctuations over the past 1,000 years, he realised. The result was a graph that showed small oscillations in temperature over that period until, about 150 years ago, there was a sudden jump, a clear indication that human activities were likely to be involved. A colleague suggested the graph looked like a hockey stick and the name stuck. The results of the study were published in Nature in 1998. Mann's life changed for ever. \"The trouble is that the hockey stick graph become an icon and deniers reckoned if they could smash the icon, the whole concept of global warming would be destroyed with it. Bring down Mike Mann and we can bring down the IPCC, they reckoned. It is a classic technique for the deniers' movement, I have discovered, and I don't mean only those who reject the idea of global warming but those who insist that smoking doesn't cause cancer or that industrial pollution isn't linked to acid rain.\" A barrage of intimidation was generated by \"a Potemkin village\" of policy foundations, as Mann puts it. These groups were set up by privately-funded groups that included Koch Industries and Scaife Foundations and bore names such as the Cato Institute, Americans for Prosperity and the Heartland Institute. These groups bombarded Mann with freedom of information requests while the scientist was served with a subpoena by Republican congressman Joe Barton to provide access to his correspondence. The purported aim was to clarify issues. The real aim was to intimidate Mann. In addition, Mann has been attacked by Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican attorney general of Virginia who has campaigned to have the scientist stripped of academic credentials. Several committees of inquiry have investigated Mann's work. All have exonerated him. Thousands of emails have been sent to Mann, many deeply unpleasant. \"You and your colleagues\u2026 ought to be shot, quartered and fed to the pigs along with your whole damn families,\" said one. \"I was hopin [sic] I would see the news and you commited [sic] suicide,\" ran another. Yet all that Mann had done was publish to a study suggesting, in cautious terms, that Earth had started to heat up unexpectedly in the past few decades. \"On one occasion, I had to call the FBI after I was sent an envelope with a powder in it,\" Mann adds. \"It turned out to be cornmeal but again the aim was intimidation. I ended up with police security tape all over my office doors and windows. That is the life of a climate scientist today in the US.\" Mann insists he will not give up. \"I have a six-year-old daughter and she reminds me what we are fighting for.\" Indeed, Mann is generally optimistic that climate change deniers and their oil and coal industry backers have overstepped the mark and goaded scientists to take action. He points to a recent letter, signed by 250 members of the US National Academy of Science, including 11 Nobel laureates, and published in Science. The letter warns about the dangers of the current attacks on climate scientists and calls \"for an end to McCarthy-like threats of criminal prosecution against our colleagues based on innuendo and guilt by association, the harassment of scientists by politicians seeking distractions to avoid taking action, and the outright lies being spread about them.\" \"Words like those give me hope,\" says Mann. The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars will be published by Columbia University Press in April",

Mann, creator of the \"hockey stick\" graph that illustrates recent rapid rises in global temperatures, is to publish a book next month detailing the \"disingenuous and cynical\" methods used by those who have tried to disprove his findings. <em>The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars</em> is a startling depiction of a scientist persecuted for trying to tell the truth.</p> <p>Among the tactics used against Mann were the theft and publication, in 2009, of emails he had exchanged with climate scientist Professor Phil Jones of East Anglia University. Selected, distorted versions of these emails were then published on the internet in order to undermine UN climate talks due to begin in Copenhagen a few weeks later. These negotiations ended in failure. The use of those emails to kill off the climate talks was \"a crime against humanity, a crime against the planet,\" says Mann, a scientist at Penn State University.</p> <p>In his book, Mann warns that \"public discourse has been polluted now for decades by corporate-funded disinformation \u2013 not just with climate change but with a host of health, environmental and societal threats.\" The implications for the planet are grim, he adds.</p> <p>Mann became a target of climate deniers' hate because his research revealed there has been a recent increase of almost 1\u00b0C across the globe, a rise that was unprecedented \"during at least the last 1,000 years\" and which has been linked to rising emissions of carbon dioxide from cars, factories and power plants.

      "bodyText": "Homeowners are set to suffer rising mortgage interest rates that will add almost \u00a3300 a year to the cost of a \u00a3100,000 home loan. RBS-Natwest is pushing up rates on two of its products by 0.25%, while Halifax is expected to raise its standard variable rate on Sunday. The hikes in cost come despite the Bank of England maintaining the base rate at a historic 0.5% low and are expected to raise concerns among thousands of homeowners who are already struggling to make ends meet. An RBS spokesman said on Saturday that the rate rises would take effect from 1 May and apply to two of its products, the Offset and The One Account, affecting around 200,000 customers. He said: \"Over the last year the cost of funds at which we need to borrow at to fund our mortgage commitments has risen considerably. \"We have absorbed the cost during this period but have now decided to pass on some of this increase, 0.25% to our Offset and The One Account customers. \"For the majority of our Offset and One Account customers their new rate will be 4%, the same as our standard variable rate.\" Halifax is expected to push its standard variable rate (SVR) up from 3.5% to 3.99% from 1 May, affecting around 850,000 customers. Such a rise would drive up repayments on a \u00a3100,000 mortgage by \u00a324.31 a month or \u00a3291.72 a year. Marc Gander, founder of the Consumer Action Group, said: \"It's shocking, it's coming at a time when people need this thing least of all. \"This is a nice thank you gesture to all the lovely people who bailed them out.\" He said although some banks had recorded losses at the end of last month \u2013 Lloyds revealed losses of \u00a33.5bn for 2011, while 82% state-owned RBS unveiled losses of \u00a32bn \u2013 most were doing well. \"Banks have never had it so good,\" Gander said. \"They are doing fabulously well and it amazes me that they can't decide to share some of the burden that the rest of us are sharing. \"If they are saying they have to pass on rising costs, why can't they pass some of the good times on as well as the bad times?\" He said he thought it likely that other lenders may follow the rises announced this weekend. A spokesman for Virgin Money, which took over Northern Rock on 1 January after buying it for \u00a3747m, said it had no plans to change its standard variable rate (SVR). The hikes are apparently due to higher costs of funding a mortgage in the current economic climate. They come as families are being squeezed harder than ever by rising costs of living. Among these are record high prices for petrol, announced on Friday \u2013 with the average cost of a litre at 137.44p, according to the AA, while diesel is up to 144.67p a litre, another new record.",

      "bodyText": "Ann Griffiths is head of policy at Ealing council Do we really need one vision? I find it difficult to see at the moment how the sector as a whole could achieve a single, coherent 'local government vision' beyond what it has by way of visions such as those elected representatives form in their collective roles and what representatives of the sector like the Local Government Association (LGA) facilitate by way of responses to legislation. Local government is so many different things that perhaps it is necessary that we have different visions for different elements of what we do as a whole? Connecting vision and high level strategy practically to what's done on the ground and what people go to work for is of utmost importance. It's easier said than done \u2013 not just for local government \u2013 but my inclination is that it depends a lot more on relationships and communication than is sometimes recognised. We need to collaborate more: The capacity, skills, commitment and insight local community organisations can offer is key to achieving a balanced range of services in the future. We absolutely have to build and develop the way local government works with other local organisations, of whom the voluntary and community sector are key, to succeed in meeting people's needs properly now and in the future. There are ways to do that, like looking at our combined resources and talents and the most effective way of targeting those. Control may be part of that but it's more about mature collaboration and negotiation of practical actions we can take that are of best benefit to the people we're all there to serve at the end of the day. Declan Woods is Penna's director of board and executive coaching We need leadership across local government, not just from the top: While I agree that the chief executive is a critical figure and \u2013 assuming he or she is effective \u2013 should not disappear, it also places too much reliance on a single person. Rather than focus on the heroic leader, better to focus on developing leadership more broadly and improve its bench strength across the authority to bring about real change. Anthony Zacharzewski runs the Democratic Society We need to accept that change is naturally slow: Local government has a natural rate of change that's quite slow, driven by the arrival and departure of staff and people rising through the organisation with new ideas. That natural rate is too slow to meet the timetable that societal change and cuts are forcing on it. There are people in every organisation (and outside them) who see what needs to be done, but they are scattered through every organisation and need a truly heroic mindset and persistence to make change happen when elements of the organisation around them aren't on board. Leadership for what end? We've brought up a generation of local government officers, particularly in the middle layers, for whom leadership is effective management, cost control and loyalty to organisation and client. What we need is a generation of politicians and officers (that we don't have time to create) for whom leadership is collaboration and openness. What we need to create is an openness to innovation as a usual thing. Build on existing community ties and strengthen them: It's good that people appreciate the role that local communities have as co-creators of public sector services, but before we get to internal culture change there's a lot of leg work to be done on who those communities are, how democratic identity works within them, and the way in which they take decisions. We don't want to shift decision making from elected-if-imperfect councils to a tyranny of those who turn up, or a mini-council with mini-papers and a mini-cabinet. The skill with which local government understands, surfaces and connects existing networks in its patch will be one of the success markers for creating a functioning civic space. Elizabeth James is a consultant for Berwick Partners Encouraging staff with varied backgrounds into leadership roles is a good thing: In my experience, local government can be both a supportive and challenging environment. These are conditions that are conducive to growing great leaders and indeed we do see some at the top of leading authorities already. However, how many of these truly exceptional people started their careers in local government and then remained within the sector? The member/officer dynamic is a critical element: It mustn't be forgotten that part of the officer's role is to create the means through which big political aspirations can be delivered. The question of whether there is enough political ambition for big change is a legitimate one, but let's not forget that officers need to support members in thinking in such a lateral way. Martin Rayson is vice president of the Public Sector People Managers' Association There is commitment to the principle of change in local government: People remain hugely committed to the communities they serve and do recognise that there has to be change if services are to survive. They are naturally concerned and less demonstrably supportive of change when it impacts directly on them. The mood around local government doesn't help at the moment. The focus is on cuts and we have yet to be able to create a positive sense that change is possible, that it has the potential to make things better in some ways and that local government does have a bright future. There is also a lack of understanding of the degree of change that may be necessary to enable us to continue to meet needs with significantly reduced resources in some places. If we continue to think within the boundaries of the current model we cannot succeed: We need create a sense that change is possible, highlight organisations within our sector and outside that have done it and in the tight timescales we have, and look at the factors that enabled them to succeed. One could argue that central government is not really supportive of change in local government if that means a reduction in the levels of control. There are other stakeholders who can inhibit change also, particularly when we have to be looking at whole system change in the way others suggest. We need something to unlock change. We need to attract and invest in talent: Under-investment in management and leadership development is not limited to local government, but is perceived to be holding back growth generally. Investment in leadership which drives innovatory change is crucial at the moment, not only for local authorities, but also for our partners, including potentially in the communities with whom we wish to work. Gary Miles is director of associate relations and international operations at Roffey Park Developing officers and members in collaboration and openness is key: The productive, successful local authority that delivers for its residents and the community needs to be one that is driven more by relationships than structures and processes. That means having people-leaders at all levels of the authority who can engage as ambassadors with flexibility. Although in times of change and cost-cutting, development for these people is reduced, this is a false premise if we are to build authorities that are change-ready for the future Ask not what your council can do for you but what you can do for your council: Enthusiastically ceding control to others in the community to achieve better results for customers and citizens is a worthy aspiration, but if we want voluntary organisations and community groups to take on more responsibility they will want a seat at the top, to be able to influence council policy and strategy going forward. Chris Paul is a media and events professional standing for local council in the south of Wales It comes down to perception when thinking about turnout and involvement: Councils run multi-million pound budgets but the perception is that local government is just about street lighting and graffiti. This needs to be challenged by councillors who are prepared to go the extra mile and represent people, not merely party political interests. Councillors who champion community rather than taking \u00a312,000 a year to attend once a month meetings are what is required. If we can dynamise the grassroots we can radicalise the centre. The voting system is key: In Scotland, where the Scottish National Party has challenged a complacent hegemony very effectively, the use of the single transferable vote in local elections has driven out the seat for life mentality that afflicts us, due to the pre-eminence of first past the post voting systems in the rest of the UK. Adopting a more representative voting system is the first stage in creating a more \"voter/customer-centric\" executive at local level.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Ann Griffiths is head of policy at </strong><a href=\"http://www.ealing.gov.uk/site/\" title=\"\"><strong>Ealing council</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Do we really need one vision?</strong> I find it difficult to see at the moment how the sector as a whole could achieve a single, coherent 'local government vision' beyond what it has by way of visions such as those elected representatives form in their collective roles and what representatives of the sector like the <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Local Government Association</a> (LGA) facilitate by way of responses to legislation. Local government is so many different things that perhaps it is necessary that we have different visions for different elements of what we do as a whole? Connecting vision and high level strategy practically to what's done on the ground and what people go to work for is of utmost importance. It's easier said than done \u2013 not just for local government \u2013 but my inclination is that it depends a lot more on relationships and communication than is sometimes recognised.</p> <p><strong>We need to collaborate more:</strong> The capacity, skills, commitment and insight local community organisations can offer is key to achieving a balanced range of services in the future. We absolutely have to build and develop the way local government works with other local organisations, of whom the voluntary and community sector are key, to succeed in meeting people's needs properly now and in the future. There are ways to do that, like looking at our combined resources and talents and the most effective way of targeting those. Control may be part of that but it's more about mature collaboration and negotiation of practical actions we can take that are of best benefit to the people we're all there to serve at the end of the day.</p> <h2><strong>Declan Woods is </strong><a href=\"http://www.penna.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Penna</strong></a><strong>'s</strong><strong> director of board and executive coaching</strong></h2> <p><strong>We need leadership across local government, not just from the top:</strong> While I agree that the chief executive is a critical figure and \u2013 assuming he or she is effective \u2013 should not disappear, it also places too much reliance on a single person. Rather than focus on the heroic leader, better to focus on developing leadership more broadly and improve its bench strength across the authority to bring about real change.</p> <h2><strong>Anthony Zacharzewski runs the </strong><a href=\"http://www.demsoc.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Democratic Society</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>We need to accept that change is naturally slow:</strong> Local government has a natural rate of change that's quite slow, driven by the arrival and departure of staff and people rising through the organisation with new ideas. That natural rate is too slow to meet the timetable that societal change and cuts are forcing on it. There are people in every organisation (and outside them) who see what needs to be done, but they are scattered through every organisation and need a truly heroic mindset and persistence to make change happen when elements of the organisation around them aren't on board.</p> <p><strong>Leadership for what end?</strong> We've brought up a generation of local government officers, particularly in the middle layers, for whom leadership is effective management, cost control and loyalty to organisation and client. What we need is a generation of politicians and officers (that we don't have time to create) for whom leadership is collaboration and openness. What we need to create is an openness to innovation as a usual thing.</p> <p><strong>Build on existing community ties and strengthen them:</strong> It's good that people appreciate the role that local communities have as co-creators of public sector services, but before we get to internal culture change there's a lot of leg work to be done on who those communities are, how democratic identity works within them, and the way in which they take decisions. We don't want to shift decision making from elected-if-imperfect councils to a tyranny of those who turn up, or a mini-council with mini-papers and a mini-cabinet. The skill with which local government understands, surfaces and connects existing networks in its patch will be one of the success markers for creating a functioning civic space.</p> <h2><strong>Elizabeth James is a consultant for </strong><a href=\"http://www.berwickpartners.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Berwick Partners</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Encouraging staff with varied backgrounds into leadership roles is a good thing:</strong> In my experience, local government can be both a supportive and challenging environment. These are conditions that are conducive to growing great leaders and indeed we do see some at the top of leading authorities already. However, how many of these truly exceptional people started their careers in local government and then remained within the sector?</p> <p><strong>The member/officer dynamic is a critical element:</strong> It mustn't be forgotten that part of the officer's role is to create the means through which big political aspirations can be delivered.<strong> </strong>The question of whether there is enough political ambition for big change is a legitimate one, but let's not forget that officers need to support members in thinking in such a lateral way.</p> <h2><strong>Martin Rayson is vice president of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.ppma.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Public Sector People Managers' Association</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>There is commitment to the principle of change in local government:</strong> People remain hugely committed to the communities they serve and do recognise that there has to be change if services are to survive. They are naturally concerned and less demonstrably supportive of change when it impacts directly on them. The mood around local government doesn't help at the moment. The focus is on cuts and we have yet to be able to create a positive sense that change is possible, that it has the potential to make things better in some ways and that local government does have a bright future. There is also a lack of understanding of the degree of change that may be necessary to enable us to continue to meet needs with significantly reduced resources in some places.</p> <p><strong>If we continue to think within the boundaries of the current model we cannot succeed:</strong> We need create a sense that change is possible, highlight organisations within our sector and outside that have done it and in the tight timescales we have, and look at the factors that enabled them to succeed. One could argue that central government is not really supportive of change in local government if that means a reduction in the levels of control. There are other stakeholders who can inhibit change also, particularly when we have to be looking at whole system change in the way others suggest. We need something to unlock change.</p> <p><strong>We need to attract and invest in talent:</strong> Under-investment in management and leadership development is not limited to local government, but is perceived to be holding back growth generally. Investment in leadership which drives innovatory change is crucial at the moment, not only for local authorities, but also for our partners, including potentially in the communities with whom we wish to work.</p> <h2><strong>Gary Miles is director of associate relations and international operations at </strong><a href=\"http://www.roffeypark.com/home/\" title=\"\"><strong>Roffey Park</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Developing officers and members in collaboration and openness is key:</strong> The productive, successful local authority that delivers for its residents and the community needs to be one that is driven more by relationships than structures and processes.

As the Cheltenham Festival looms upon the horizon, trainers seem to have taken their eye off the ball in respect of this contest which carries as much prize money as some of the handicaps at the big meeting. Having shaped nicely behind an improving rival on his reappearance, Fine Parchment has been disappointing since but has slipped back down the weights as a result and will be suited by the return to good ground and a flat track. Furthermore, Mann has played his cards well in booking the 10lb claimer Gavin Sheehan, who has looked tidy enough so far this season. Able to claim his full allowance, Fine Parchment will be running here off a featherweight. Newbury 2.05 A major eyecatcher when staying on steadily into third on his first start for over a year at Wincanton recently, Buck Magic is going to take plenty of beating here, particularly as the extra quarter-mile should play into his hands. Doncaster 2.20 Springtime seems to suit Sir Harry Ormesher, who regularly tends to find his form at this stage of the season. With a good record at this track and no stamina doubts, he can earn a tilt at a Cheltenham Festival prize. Newbury 2.40 Having only capitulated late on in last year's Grand National, Niche Market showed that race had left no apparent scars when second at the same course behind West End Rocker in December. Good ground here will suit him a lot better. Doncaster 3.25 With the weights now out for the National, Junior has nothing to lose by winning this contest en route to Aintree. He caught the eye on his recent return to action over hurdles, showing plenty of enthusiasm until lack of fitness told. Most importantly, he could well get his own way in front in this small field and dominating tactics seem to suit. Newbury 3.40 With a 557-day absence to overcome, Balgarry obviously has his fitness to prove, but few trainers are as adept at David Pipe at bringing their horses back from a break in peak form.

I was soon contacted to arrange a date for an interview. I was nervous, excited and worried \u2013 I, like many people, have a number of commitments and extracurricular activities, but I understood that working and earning some money would have to take priority over them. How could I complain? After almost two years of relentlessly handing out CVs and application forms, this was the closest I had ever got to employment. A day after the interview was arranged, I received another call to inform me that a recruitment ban had been put in place at the store and they were no longer hiring. Despite my frustration, I wasn't all that surprised. With this supermarket having originally been named as one of the prime leaders in the government's \"work experience\" scheme, why on earth would they hire me for a permanent position when they can sift through all the eager, cheap young labour being filtered through the system? Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne said on the BBC's Daily Politics show that workfare was designed to combat a \"something for nothing\" culture in our society. However, the major flaw in this argument is that major corporations are getting exactly what they want for nothing. Some of them claim that they may end up paying work experience placements, but this will never amount to the full wage of an employee contract. Everyone can agree that work experience and training are important and fulfilling, but they should not be to the benefit of exploitative businesses, designed to minimise cost and maximise profit. Surely it's worth questioning that there is now such a plethora of available work placements on a weekly basis: are we to believe that none of these could be converted to actual jobs? The system is just self-manufacturing biased and false success. The government is constantly throwing statistics at the media in attempts to qualify their \"achievements\", but the rate of people finding work following the scheme does not differ much from the amount of time it usually takes someone on benefits to find employment anyway. The information is too quantitative and not qualitative enough to explain unique individual cases of how employment was found. Here's a statistic that the government is been rather quiet about: seizure of cannabis in England and Wales has more than doubled since 2004.

      "bodyText": "Syrian activists say troops are shelling several districts in the rebellious central city of Homs where the government is stopping a Red Cross convoy from reaching thousands stranded in the area. Abu Hassan al-Homsi, a doctor at a makeshift clinic in Khaldiyeh district of Homs, said he had treated a dozen wounded from the latest onslaught. The Local Co-ordination Committees activist network said mortars began slaimming into Khaldiyeh, Bab Sbaa and Khader districts of the city early on Saturday. The shelling comes amid a standoff between the government and the Red Cross, which says authorities have prevented its convoy from delivering badly needed food, medical supplies and blankets to thousands of people still stranded in Baba Amr, the rebel-held district of Homs that was overrun by troops on Thursday. Despite receiving permission from the government to send a convoy with seven truckloads of aid into Baba Amr, the Red Cross was prevented from entering the neighbourhood, an action it described as \"unacceptable\". The refusal to allow the convoy in to treat and evacuate the wounded came as the organisation announced that the Syrian authorities had handed over the bodies of Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik, who were killed in an attack on a press centre in Baba Amr over a week ago. \"We have the bodies of two journalists, Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik. They are being taken by ambulance of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, accompanied by the ICRC, and are heading to Damascus,\" chief spokeswoman Carla Haddad told Reuters in Geneva. \"They were handed over in Homs by the Syrian authorities.\" The French journalist Edith Bouvier, who was badly wounded in the same attack, arrived back in France on Friday with her colleague William Daniels. The Commenting on the halting of the convoy, Red Cross president, Jakob Kellenberger, said: \"It is unacceptable that people who have been in need of emergency assistance for weeks have still not received any help. \"We are staying in Homs tonight in the hope of entering Baba Amr in the very near future. In addition, many families have fled Baba Amr, and we will help them as soon as we possibly can. \"We reiterate the appeal we made several days ago, for a daily two-hour halt in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance,\" added Kellenberger. \"The humanitarian situation was very serious then and it is worse now.\" The Red Cross had hoped to bring urgent medical and food aid to civilians trapped in Baba Amr after fighters with the Free Syrian Army announced on Thursday that they were withdrawing from their positions. Reports from other opposition-held neighbourhoods in the city of one million suggested that fighters may also have pulled back from their positions there. Anti-Assad activists have accused Syrian troops of burning houses, arresting all males over the age of 12 and of extrajudicial killings, including the alleged beheadings of 17 men captured after the suburb's fall. Bassel Fouad, a Syrian activist who fled to Lebanon from Baba Amr two days ago, said a colleague there told him that troops and pro-government gunmen known as shabiha were conducting house-to-house raids. \"The situation is worse than terrible inside Baba Amr,\" he said. \"Shabiha are entering homes and setting them on fire.\" His colleague said the gunmen lined 10 men up early on Friday and shot them dead outside a government co-operative that sells subsidised food. He said Syrian forces were detaining anyone over the age of 14 in the three-storey building. \"They begin at the start of a street and enter and search house after house,\" he said. \"Then they start with another street.\" None of his claims could be independently verified. \"There's no resistance here,\" one activist in the northern neighbourhood of Khalidiyeh told the Guardian yesterday. \"There is only shelling and bombing.\" The situation in Baba Amr itself was described by an onlooker. \"Today the Syrian army are in control. There are a lot of wounded who could not flee. The Syrian army is firing against anything they can find in front of them. They are arresting any young men they find.\" In other parts of the city, such as Khalidiyeh, residents said the fighters who remained were low on ammunition: \"We have members of the FSA here, but they have a small amount of ammunition and they are trying to use every bullet against the right target.\" He accused the army of murdering a family in Baba Amr, and added: \"The Syrian army are arresting any man they find from 14 years upwards.\" Syria has faced mounting international criticism over its bloody crackdown on the uprising, which started with peaceful protests but has become increasingly militarised. The UN has estimated that more than 7,500 people have been killed in the past year. Activists put the death toll at over 8,000. France said on Friday it is closing its embassy in Syria. The US and Britain have already closed their embassies. French president Nicolas Sarkozy called the events in Syria a \"scandal\", adding that the European Council \"condemned in the harshest terms what is happening in Syria\". Ambassador Eric Chevallier had only recently returned to Damascus after being recalled to Paris for consultations. He was sent back to help try to get Bouvier and Daniels out of Syria. The west has stepped up its criticism of Assad's regime amid mounting reports of atrocities by security forces. The US has called for Assad to step down and Hillary Clinton has said he could be considered a war criminal. Russia's prime minister Vladimir Putin criticised the west on Friday for backing the Syrian opposition against the government, saying it had fuelled the conflict. But his foreign ministry made it clear it will not be able to stop other countries from launching a military intervention if they try to do so without UN approval. Putin called for both Syrian government and opposition forces to pull out of besieged cities to end the bloodshed, adding that western refusal to make that demand of Assad's opponents has encouraged them to keep fighting. \"Do they want Assad to pull out his forces so the opposition moves right in?\" he said at a meeting with editors of western newspapers in remarks carried by state television. \"Is it a balanced approach?\" Activist groups said protesters who took to the streets in towns across Syria on Friday were met with teargas, gunfire and mass arrests. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 10 people were killed in the town of Rastan near Homs when a mortar landed near marchers. The Local Co-ordination Committees of Syria said 16 were killed in the same event, among 52 reported dead nationwide. Protesters dubbed Friday the day of \"Arming the Free Syrian Army\", reflecting a widening perception that only military action can stop the crackdown on dissent and hasten Assad's downfall.",

They are being taken by ambulance of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, accompanied by the ICRC, and are heading to Damascus,\" chief spokeswoman Carla Haddad told Reuters in Geneva. \"They were handed over in Homs by the Syrian authorities.\"</p> <p>The French journalist Edith Bouvier, who was badly wounded in the same attack, arrived back in France on Friday with her colleague William Daniels.</p> <p>The Commenting on the halting of the convoy, Red Cross president, Jakob Kellenberger, said: \"It is unacceptable that people who have been in need of emergency assistance for weeks have still not received any help.</p> <p>\"We are staying in Homs tonight in the hope of entering Baba Amr in the very near future. In addition, many families have fled Baba Amr, and we will help them as soon as we possibly can.</p> <p>\"We reiterate the appeal we made several days ago, for a daily two-hour halt in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance,\" added Kellenberger. \"The humanitarian situation was very serious then and it is worse now.\"</p> <p>The Red Cross had hoped to bring urgent medical and food aid to civilians trapped in Baba Amr after fighters with the Free Syrian Army announced on Thursday that they were withdrawing from their positions.</p> <p>Reports from other opposition-held neighbourhoods in the city of one million suggested that fighters may also have pulled back from their positions there.</p> <p>Anti-Assad activists have accused Syrian troops of burning houses, arresting all males over the age of 12 and of extrajudicial killings, including the alleged beheadings of 17 men captured after the suburb's fall.</p> <p>Bassel Fouad, a Syrian activist who fled to Lebanon from Baba Amr two days ago, said a colleague there told him that troops and pro-government gunmen known as <em>shabiha</em> were conducting house-to-house raids. \"The situation is worse than terrible inside Baba Amr,\" he said. \"<em>Shabiha</em> are entering homes and setting them on fire.\"</p> <p>His colleague said the gunmen lined 10 men up early on Friday and shot them dead outside a government co-operative that sells subsidised food. He said Syrian forces were detaining anyone over the age of 14 in the three-storey building. \"They begin at the start of a street and enter and search house after house,\" he said. \"Then they start with another street.\"</p> <p>None of his claims could be independently verified.</p> <p>\"There's no resistance here,\" one activist in the northern neighbourhood of Khalidiyeh told the Guardian yesterday. \"There is only shelling and bombing.\"</p> <p>The situation in Baba Amr itself was described by an onlooker. \"Today the Syrian army are in control.

      "bodyText": "Christmas 2010 was dominated by a big dilemma in my life: did I really want to swap my secure teaching job for the \"excitement\" and \"challenge\" of becoming a Future Leader? After their assessment centre I'd convinced myself I didn't stand a chance, and then of course the more I found out about the Future Leaders programme - a fast-track scheme to train teachers to take on headteacher posts at challenging schools and help close the UK's achievement gap - the more I wanted it. So, swallowing hard, the decision was easy when I was offered a place. I left my job and kissed goodbye to all those summer festivals I had tickets for and headed off instead for intensive training in Nottingham. We looked like an education version of The Apprentice in those early days, all wearing our suits, and all a bit nervous. Despite there being 68 of us in the 2011 cohort, we banded together with the help of our \"little black book\" of names and quirky facts about each other. It was like being back in university, except with lectures from 8am to 6pm rather than the 15 hours a week I'd been used to as an arts student. The speakers at the training were amazing: the headteachers of US charter schools and the CEO of a national Academy chain. I'd never experienced training like this before, the need to always be switched \"on\" and to remain positive even when you were emotionally and physically exhausted. Relaxing in the evenings was hard and I ended up surviving on very little sleep. After spending the best part of the summer in Nottingham with my new colleagues and friends on the programme I don't think I was alone in wanting to get into school. It was great to learn about leadership strategies but I wanted to put the training into practice. I was lucky as I had been able to spend some time in my new school in the summer term so had got to know most of the senior leadership team. There were another two people starting on the SLT at the same time as me, and they have been brilliant as we have supported each other and been a good first port of call if I am unsure about something to do with the school or if I just want a sounding board for something. The first term in any new school is tough, but joining the SLT at the same time is even tougher. I had to dig deep and find resilience. I had many difficult conversations and constantly reflected on what I was doing to constantly strive to do better. At times I did have moments of self doubt, as we all do and especially towards the end of the winter term, fighting a horrendous cold, I wondered where I was going to get energy from to do the job. But I dug deep and persevered, I stayed true to my core values and didn't apologise for them. The residential period of training really helped me, as well as the supportive network of other teachers on the programme, in fact sometimes I wonder how people cope without the kind of training I had in the move to school leadership. Over the year of Future Leaders programme, I'd had an amazing time in Nottingham, met some truly inspirational people and worked in a job that I love and which can have a real impact. There is so much more that I can do with my career and Future Leaders has given me the opportunity to really push myself and make a difference to the future of young people. And at the end of the day that is what it is all about, not me and my journey but the fact that I can help close the achievement gap and ensure students in the schools I work in do achieve. \u2022 Ruth Lydall is associate deputy headteacher at Copland Community School, Wembley. Future Leaders is an independent charity with the mission to address educational inequality by developing the next generation of leaders for challenging schools. They are recruiting up to 75 outstanding current or former teachers who have the potential to become Heads in four years and the commitment to improve the lives of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

      "bodyText": "to Britain's economy has not recovered as fast as the government expected. Growth is anaemic, and unemployment is rising. The recession has one beneficial effect: the cost of government borrowing has fallen. Give or take, the government can now borrow at exactly the rate of inflation for almost any duration. When it calculated the losses on the student loan book the government assumed that it would have to pay 2.2% above inflation to borrow money. That was a reasonable assumption then, but it is not a reasonable assumption now. When interest rates are 2.2% above inflation, the government loses approximately 25p for every pound loaned to students. When interest rates equal inflation, the government is predicted to make a small profit on the student loan book, even taking into account the fall in graduate incomes caused by the recession. Enough students will pay the 0-3% interest rate supplement to cover the losses from those students who do not pay off their loan in full. It is therefore apparently costless to expand university places this year. Naysayers will point out that expanding higher education brings other costs. Some students, for example, are eligible for maintenance grants, averaging perhaps \u00a31,500. This is approximately twice the estimated profit that the government will make on the student loan book. The government could however require universities to offer additional places to cover this cost. Economies of scale in the university sector mean that many universities may be happy to expand even if they have to remit a few hundred pounds to the government for each additional student. The government needs to be clear about whether additional students are likely to have the same income trajectories as the average student on which these figures are based. Additional students may not have as successful careers. Again, however, the government can still ensure that the expansion is costless by placing a cap on the level of student fees for the additional places. This will then serve as a cap on the additional loans. Lots of people will claim that falling government interest rates mean that their pet project is now viable: the \"spend to save\" mantra is much overused. What makes this scheme different is that the government gains an asset that delivers a financial return on a contractual basis. The government's return is not contingent on the investment raising the rate of economic growth. Instead, it is guaranteed to get 9% of a student's income over the \u00a321,000 threshold, even if that student does not earn any more money as a result of going to university. Investment in university places is radically different to investment in infrastructure or schools. This is understood by statisticians, who increased the deficit only by the predicted loss on students, rather than by the full extent of the loan. This proposal makes sense in government accounting terms, as well as in economic terms. The government should therefore expand higher education now. It should do so by making the places open to competition so that students not politicians choose which universities get to expand. This would cut youth unemployment immediately, and raise growth in the medium term. It is free to the government in both accounting terms, and in underlying economic terms. No other policy offers these advantages and the government must seize it immediately.

Instead, it is guaranteed to get 9% of a student's income over the \u00a321,000 threshold, even if that student does not earn any more money as a result of going to university.</p> <p>Investment in university places is radically different to investment in infrastructure or schools. This is understood by statisticians, who increased the deficit only by the predicted loss on students, rather than by the full extent of the loan. This proposal makes sense in government accounting terms, as well as in economic terms.</p> <p>The government should therefore expand higher education now. It should do so by making the places open to competition so that students not politicians choose which universities get to expand.</p> <p>This would cut youth unemployment immediately, and raise growth in the medium term. It is free to the government in both accounting terms, and in underlying economic terms. No other policy offers these advantages and the government must seize it immediately.</p> <p><em>Tim Leunig is chief economist at CentreForum, the liberal think tank, and a reader in economic history at </em><a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>LSE</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

      "bodyText": "Conservative rivals of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are leading in the race for Iranian parliament seats, according to early election results. In a huge embarrassment, Parvin Ahmadinejad, a younger sister of the president, was defeated by a conservative rival in their hometown of Garmsar. The conservatives' lead was expected as the elections boiled down to a contest between conservatives supporting and opposing Ahmadinejad. Early returns on Saturday in the capital, Tehran, showed loyalists to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, were pulling ahead. Partial results from provincial towns showed conservative Ahmadinejad rivals elected in many constituencies. The results indicate Ahmadinejad may face a more hostile parliament in the nearly two years remaining of his second term in office. The authorities in Tehran attempted to portray a country united amid threats of war and western economic sanctions as Iranians went to the polls on Friday for the first time since the bitterly contested elections of 2009. Iran's state television broadcast rolling coverage of the parliamentary elections, which began at 8am local time, showing hundreds of people queuing up in polling stations across the country to cast their ballots in what has been described as the most sensitive vote in the history of the Islamic republic. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose authority as the man with the ultimate power in the country was challenged by the protests that followed the allegedly rigged results in 2009, was one of the first people to vote before television cameras. \"Whenever there has been more enmity towards Iran the importance of the elections has been greater,\" he said. \"The arrogant powers are bullying us to maintain their prestige. A high turnout will be better for our nation \u2026 and for preserving security.\" The ayatollah described voting as a religious \"responsibility\" like that of Namaz, the Muslim practice of prayer five times a day. With political discontent at home and international pressure making the regime vulnerable, turnout will be a litmus test for the legitimacy of its leaders. Iran's opposition, crushed in recent years and banned from running in the elections, largely called for a countrywide boycott of the vote. Many activists sympathetic to the Green movement took to social networking websites to urge Iranians to embarrass the regime by staying at home. Some distributed leaflets reading \"I won't vote\". For the opposition it was a non-event, although some Iranian politicians affiliated to the opposition, including former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, participated. Some believe they were forced to. \"In the past few decades I have always participated in elections held in this country despite my hatred for the regime, because I always believed in reform,\" a member of the Iranian opposition told the Guardian from Tehran, asking not to be named for fear of reprisal. \"But after the events in 2009 I finally gave up and sat at home this time.\" Human Rights Watch, a New-York based organisation that has closely monitored the situation of activists and campaigners in Iran, issued a statement on Thursday, warning that a fair vote was impossible in the country. \"Iran's parliamentary elections \u2026 will be grossly unfair,\" HRW said. \"[It] follows the disqualification of hundreds of candidates based on vague and ill-defined criteria, and opposition leaders are either barred from participating, serving unjust prison sentences, or refusing to participate in what they consider sham elections.\" The opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi were placed under house arrest in February 2011. Despite the boycott, reports from Iran suggested many people, especially those in small and conservative cities, participated in the vote. Since 2010 the Iranian government has run a scheme of direct monthly payments to families in compensation for a cut in subsidies. Although the money (almost $37) does not catch the eyes of middle-class Iranians, it has been popular with poorer families who are believed to have voted in relatively large numbers. \"It was a quiet day in Tehran, even from the state television's broadcast you could see that only old people were voting,\" said Hamed, a Tehran resident. \"However, I think people in small cities who have little access to information and are pleased with the government's payments would vote, although I think the turnout would be less than 30%.\" Iran's interior minister, Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar, was quick to predict a high turnout and Tehran's governor, Morteza Tamadon, said there was a record vote in the capital. In the runup to the elections Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi, an influential cleric, issued a religious ruling that to not vote would be a sin. The wife of an assassinated nuclear scientist also urged people to vote. Iran's leaders warned that they would consider any attempt to encourage an electoral boycott as a crime. In the absence of the opposition, Friday's parliamentary vote was a battlefield for factions within the establishment, fighting each other for a greater share of power. It could also be decisive for the future of a power struggle between supporters of the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on one side and conservatives close to Khamenei on the other. Some observers believe that the results will only consolidate Khamenei's power more than ever in the parliament, making an already lame-duck president more isolated. Ahmadinejad's term ends in 2013. Foreign media were largely not allowed into Iran to cover the elections and those in the country could not operate freely. \"This is the 1st election I've covered anywhere in the world where authorities ordered reporters on buses to cover vote, \" Ivan Watson of CNN tweeted. \"Visiting foreign journalists covering the election in Tehran have all been sent back to their hotels and told to stay put,\" tweeted another journalist, Jason Rezaian. More than 48 million Iranians are eligible to vote in the Majlis elections.",

      "bodyText": "A powerful storm system has hit America's midwest and south, spawning a rash of powerful tornadoes that have taken at least 28 lives, blown down buildings and caused terror across a broad swath of the country. At least 28 people were killed, including 14 in Indiana and 12 in Kentucky, authorities said. In Indiana, Marysville was leveled and nearby Henryville also suffered extreme damage. Each is home to about 2,000 people. The severe weather moved across the centre of the US from Georgia to Ohio, triggering massive thunderstorms and reports of tornadoes touching down and causing mayhem. By Friday afternoon there were 19 tornado warnings in six states. It followed an outbreak of tornadoes earlier this week that killed 13 people in roughly the same region. Indiana authorities say 14 people have been killed by tornadoes that ripped through the southern portion of the state. Officials said the small hamlet of Marysville in the south had taken the brunt of the storm. It was \"completely gone\", Clark county sheriff major Chuck Adams told the Associated Press. Local homeland security medical teams were being dispatched to assess the situation. The National Weather Service said it was tracking \"extreme damage\" in nearby Henrysville. The powerful storm system was also causing problems in states far to the south, including Alabama and Tennessee where dozens of houses were damaged. The outbreak comes two days after a round of storms killed 13 people in the midwest and 0south. At least 20 homes were badly damaged and six people were hospitalised in the Chattanooga, Tennessee, area after strong winds and hail lashed the area. Thousands of schoolchildren in several states were sent home as a precaution, and several Kentucky universities were closed. The Huntsville, Alabama, mayor said students in area schools sheltered in hallways as severe weather passed in the morning. In Alabama storms blew the roof off a prison outside Huntsville. No prisoners escaped the maximum security jail nor were any injured. At the same time school was cancelled or pupils were sent home in Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky. Up to 50 homes may have been destroyed in Hamilton County, Tennessee, according to CNN, and perhaps up to 24 people injured. In Huntsville, Alabama, at least four people were reported as having been taken to hospital. The fresh rash of storms came just two days after as many as 35 tornadoes touched down in the US in a single 24-hour period, killing 13 people. Six people were killed in Harrisburg, Illinois, when a twister ripped through the town centre. A hundred more citizens were injured. Meanwhile, in Harveyville, Kansas, about half the town of 240 people was levelled by a tornado. One person died. There appears to have been a spike in tornado activity in the US. Last year was the busiest year for tornadoes in in 75 years with at least 550 people killed. In April 2011 alone 322 people died, mostly in Alabama when a twister hit the city of Tuscaloosa; while in May 180 people were killed, at least 160 of whom died in the town of Joplin, Missouri, which was hit by a huge storm. But so far the 2012 tornado season has got off to a much quicker start than normal. In January 2011 16 tornadoes hit America. But in January 2012 that number jumped to 95. In California, a late winter storm that dumped at least six feet of snow in parts of the Sierra Nevada mountains created ripe conditions on Friday for snow sports enthusiasts but also posed avalanche dangers, as one man died while skiing in back country.",

      "bodyText": "BP will pay out $7.8bn (\u00a35bn) to settle a lawsuit with thousands of individuals from the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, under an agreement reached late on Friday night. The settlement, announced by Judge Carl Barbier, was reached just ahead of Monday's trial in a New Orleans court. The trial, already delayed by a week to allow extra time for negotiations, has been postponed again. With one major settlement achieved, BP will probably redouble its efforts to reach a deal with the federal government over fines related to the spill. In a statement late on Friday night, the oil company said it would use the remainder of the $20bn compensation fund raised in the summer of 2010 to settle claims with tens of thousands of shrimp boat captains, condo owners and others who suffered losses in the spill. The company said it had already paid out about $8bn from the fund. The oil company said the $7.8bn would also include $2.3bn for the Gulf seafood industry. \"From the beginning, BP stepped up to meet our obligations to the communities in the Gulf Coast region and we've worked hard to deliver on that commitment for nearly two years,\" said Bob Dudley, the BP chief executive. \"The proposed settlement represents significant progress toward resolving issues from the Deepwater Horizon accident and contributing further to economic and environmental restoration efforts along the Gulf Coast.\" Eleven men were killed in the 20 April 2010 blowout on the Deepwater Horizon. By the time BP regained control of its well 87 days later, the Gulf was fouled by some 4.9m barrels of crude, destroying shrimp and oyster harvests and the tourist season. It was America's worst oil spill. and the civil trial of BP and the other companies involved on the Deepwater Horizon had been expected to be one of the biggest and most complex legal proceedings in modern history. Hundreds of lawyers for all parties were involved in preparing for the trial \u2013 and in parallel negotiations to try to get a settlement. There were 340 lawyers from 90 different firms working on the plaintiffs' side alone. The deal between BP and more than 120,000 victims of the spill \u2013 from shrimp boat captains to sales teams at time-share condos, restaurateurs and wedding planners \u2013 settles what is arguably the most complicated part of the legal proceedings. But it will not be universally welcomed in the Gulf, where there is a strong undercurrent of opinion that wants to see BP held to account in court in addition to offering financial compensation. Dean Blanchard, a leading shrimp producer from Grand Isle, Louisiana, before the spill, was adamant: payment would not be enough. \"I want my day in court,\" he said. \"If they can get off with just paying the money \u2013 well, they've got plenty of money, they are not really going to learn a lesson. \"I'd like to make sure this never happens again. Somebody has got to hold BP's feet to the fire. They have just gotten away with throwing money at problems, but that doesnt get rid of the problems.\" Friday night's deal will also not resolve all of BP's legal challenges. The federal government, and the state governments of Louisiana and Alabama, are also pursuing claims, although the federal government is believed to be actively negotiating with BP to reach a deal over civilian fines for environmental damage done during the spill. If BP is found guilty of gross negligence those fines could reach $17bn. BP is in a legal battle with the other companies that were involved in the runaway well: Transocean, which owned the oil rig, and Halliburton, which cemented the well. Those legal brawls, over the share of the costs of covering those damages, could continue even after the claims have settled. \"Delays or deals made by other players do not change the facts of this case and we are fully prepared to argue the merits of our case based on those facts,\" a spokesman for Transocean said on Friday night.",

The company said it had already paid out about $8bn from the fund.</p> <p>The oil company said the $7.8bn would also include $2.3bn for the Gulf seafood industry.</p> <p>\"From the beginning, BP stepped up to meet our obligations to the communities in the Gulf Coast region and we've worked hard to deliver on that commitment for nearly two years,\" said Bob Dudley, the BP chief executive. \"The proposed settlement represents significant progress toward resolving issues from the Deepwater Horizon accident and contributing further to economic and environmental restoration efforts along the Gulf Coast.\"</p> <p>Eleven men were killed in the 20 April 2010 blowout on the Deepwater Horizon. By the time BP regained control of its well 87 days later, the Gulf was fouled by some 4.9m barrels of crude, destroying shrimp and oyster harvests and the tourist season.</p> <p>It was America's worst oil spill. and the civil trial of BP and the other companies involved on the Deepwater Horizon had been expected to be one of the biggest and most complex legal proceedings in modern history.</p> <p>Hundreds of lawyers for all parties were involved in preparing for the trial \u2013 and in parallel negotiations to try to get a settlement. There were 340 lawyers from 90 different firms working on the plaintiffs' side alone.</p> <p>The deal between BP and more than 120,000 victims of the spill \u2013 from shrimp boat captains to sales teams at time-share condos, restaurateurs and wedding planners \u2013 settles what is arguably the most complicated part of the legal proceedings.</p> <p>But it will not be universally welcomed in the Gulf, where there is a strong undercurrent of opinion that wants to see BP held to account in court in addition to offering financial compensation.</p> <p>Dean Blanchard, a leading shrimp producer from Grand Isle, Louisiana, before the spill, was adamant: payment would not be enough.</p> <p>\"I want my day in court,\" he said. \"If they can get off with just paying the money \u2013 well, they've got plenty of money, they are not really going to learn a lesson.</p> <p>\"I'd like to make sure this never happens again. Somebody has got to hold BP's feet to the fire. They have just gotten away with throwing money at problems, but that doesnt get rid of the problems.\"</p> <p>Friday night's deal will also not resolve all of BP's legal challenges.</p> <p>The federal government, and the state governments of Louisiana and Alabama, are also pursuing claims, although the federal government is believed to be actively negotiating with BP to reach a deal over civilian fines for environmental damage done during the spill. If BP is found guilty of gross negligence those fines could reach $17bn.</p> <p>BP is in a legal battle with the other companies that were involved in the runaway well: Transocean, which owned the oil rig, and Halliburton, which cemented the well. Those legal brawls, over the share of the costs of covering those damages, could continue even after the claims have settled.</p> <p>\"Delays or deals made by other players do not change the facts of this case and we are fully prepared to argue the merits of our case based on those facts,\" a spokesman for Transocean said on Friday night.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A eurosceptic Conservative MEP has joined the United Kingdom Independence Party (Ukip) and will address its Spring conference on Saturday, according to a UKIP spokesman Roger Helmer, who has been sharply critical of David Cameron for failing to fall into line with eurospectic calls for a repatriation of powers from Brussels, had last autumn announced his intention to step down as an MEP. News of his defection caused little surprise in political circles, with some observers speculation that the Tory leader would be glad to see the back of Helmer, who was known for holding controversial views. Although he had been expected to hand over his seat to fellow Eurosceptic Rupert Matthews, it was unclear if Helmer had decided to stay on as an MEP. A climate sceptic, he launched a poster campaign in 2010 to promote his opposition to climate change policies which he described as \"Probably unnecessary, Certainly ineffectual, Ruinously expensive.\" Last year, he reignited a controversy about degrees of severity in rape when he suggested that some rape victims shared responsibility for the crime. Helmer was also condemned by campaigners after he used twitter to suggest homosexuality could be treated as a mental health problem. A Ukip spokesperson confirmed that Helmer had joined the party and would be addressing its Spring conference in Skegness on Saturday. The spokesman claimed that recent defection by a leading member of Conservative Future and by a trade unionist suggested that Ukip was picking up support from the right and the left. \"It's not just Tories who are coming over to us because you just have to look at the news to see that what we were predicting several years ago is now happening in Europe,\" he added. Eurosceptic Tory MPs continued to bang the drum for their cause in recent days ahead of Cameron's attendance alongside other European leaders in Brussels, where the UK and the Czech Republic were the only two of the 27 EU states that did not sign a new treaty to enforce budget discipline within the bloc. In parliamentary debate secured by Conservative MP Bill Cash, who is chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, backbenchers questioned whether the fiscal treaty was legal.",

      "bodyText": "The Awkward Squad, On tour Emmerdale fans wondering why Val Pollard stomped off into the Dales recently should know that it wasn't so much a crucial plot twist as the fact that the actress who plays the stroppy geordie \u2013 Charlie Hardwick \u2013 is currently performing on stage. The Awkward Squad, penned by Karin Young, is an all-female affair looking at the challenges facing modern women. Hardwick plays one of two daughters who descend with kids in tow on grandmother Lorna, who longs for the quiet life but finds her past questioned and her future in doubt. Customs House, South Shields, Sat; Arts Theatre, WC2, Wed to 7 Apr Mark Cook Betrayal, Glasgow Dominic Hill's move from Edinburgh's Traverse to Glasgow's Citizens Theatre was a surprise in many ways, but it certainly allows him to take on plays that just wouldn't have been possible at the Edinburgh new writing theatre. His first season reflects this new-found freedom as he'll be directing David Hayman as King Lear and reviving Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape and Footfalls. First off though is Harold Pinter's 1978 three-hander, inspired by the playwright's relationship with Joan Bakewell, which uses reverse chronology to excavate a seven-year affair from its end back to the moment it began. It's a wonderful play, up there with Pinter's best, in which the betrayal of the title takes many forms. Citizens Theatre, to 24 Mar Lyn Gardner Can We Talk About This? On tour Four years ago the acclaimed dance/physical theatre company DV8 brought an exciting new voice to the National Theatre with To Be Straight With You, an exploration of intolerance, religion and homosexuality. Now artistic director Lloyd Newson returns to the Southbank with his company for Can We Talk About This?, in which freedom of speech, censorship, multiculturalism and Islam are the issues investigated \u2013 indeed the piece uses real voices and interviews from leading figures in the relevant fields. Along the way it reflects on such events as the 1989 burnings of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the murder of Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh in 2004 over his film Submission and the controversial Mohammed cartoons published by the Jyllands-Posten newspaper in Denmark in 2005. Lyttelton Theatre, SE1, Fri to 28 Mar; then touring 18-26 May MC Saturday Night And Sunday Morning, Manchester There are plenty of portraits of working-class life on stage at the moment, with DH Lawrence's The Daughter-In-Law at the Lowry and the Octagon's 1960s Jack the lad, Alfie, touring all over. For a different take on the mid-20th century working-class male, however, head to Manchester where Matthew Dunster directs his own adaptation of Alan Sillitoe's novel. Perry Fitzpatrick from This Is England '86 plays Arthur Seaton, the factory worker living in 1950s Nottingham, where the postwar glow of triumph was fading fast and grim reality was setting in. Royal Exchange, to 7 Apr LG Red Light Winter, Bath New Yorkers Matt and Davis used to room together in college, but now in their 30s and busy with their lives they are no longer as close. So they decide to get away from it all and take a trip together to Amsterdam. Here they meet Christina, a young prostitute. But the past has a way of running after you even as you try to escape it. Adam Rapp's play premiered at Chicago's Steppenwolf theatre before transferring off-Broadway, and marks the first in a season of contemporary American plays at the Ustinov that will also include work by Howard Korder and Sarah Ruhl. Ustinov Studio, to 31 Mar LG A Provincial Life, Cardiff The latest production from National Theatre Wales turns to one of the immense talents to come out of Wales. Playwright and director Peter Gill was born and raised in Cardiff and his early work was shot through with his experience of the city as he was growing up. Now he returns home and to the newly rebuilt Sherman theatre to direct his own adaptation of Chekhov's story about life in provincial Russia in the 1890s. The story of a young man, aware of his privilege, who longs to create a society based on equality, the show will have a strong Welsh flavour, and a large cast of professional and semi-professional actors. Sherman Cymru, to 17 Mar LG Nederlands Dans Theater 2, On tour Since its formation in 1978 as the second, apprentice company to the original NDT, NDT 2 has cornered the market in young, exuberant physicality. Jir\u00ed Jyli\u00e1n's Gods And Dogs is the headlining work of the company's current UK tour, set to a composite score of Beethoven chamber music and a new composition by Dirk Haubrich. Joining it on the bill in London is Cacti by ex-NDT dancer Alexander Ekman, and Passe-Partout by NDT1's resident duo Paul Lightfoot and Sol Le\u00f3n. Sadler's Wells, EC1, Tue to Fri; then touring to 31 Mar Judith Mackrell Scottish Dance Theatre, On tour In the last 14 years, Janet Smith has taken SDT to a truly international level. For her last season ahead of her departure to become principal of the Northern School Of Contemporary Dance, she's programmed a showcase of all she's renowned for. There's My Sweet Little Fur, a solo by Idan Cohen, which offers a one-man argument between animal instinct and cultural artifice. Joining it on tour is Pavlova's Dogs by Rachel Lopez de la Nieta, inspired by Pavlov's investigations into human conditioning and \"exposing the absurdity in my own and other human activities\".

      "bodyText": "Fingerprint, Manchester When their original home, The Attic, was forced to close due to essential works on the railway arch under which it was situated, Manchester could easily have lost young night Fingerprint. Luckily, the ambitions of residents Bill Jones, Brad Parkins and Iain Dixon meant they weren't going to give up easily. Their trademark mix of deep-to-classic American house and contemporary European flavours cropped up in back rooms at Sankeys and at Mono_cult in Leeds during their homeless stint, but now the crew are back at a regular home in Manchester, to which they invite fellow up-and-coming Manchester guest Hannah Hammond on Friday. Headlining proceedings is Terrence Parker, not the best known DJ/producer from Detroit \u2013 perhaps because he operates outside of the techno arena \u2013 but nevertheless a constant presence on the underground scene for over 20 years. Joshua Brooks, Princess Street, Fri Marc Rowlands Visionquest, London Visionquest are a musical collective formed by schoolfriends Seth Troxler, Lee Curtiss, Ryan Crosson and Shaun Reeves in Detroit back in the mid-2000s. Like a kind of techno Wu-Tang Clan, they all went on to achieve solo success, before reconvening last year to launch the Visionquest label and embark on a series of wild three-deck DJ adventures together. It proved to be so much fun that they're still at it, commandeering Fabric's main room for a night of luxuriant deep disco and celebratory tech house. In among it all, Ryan and Lee intend to premiere some new material, and there's a bonus live set from Visionquest-signed synth-pop duo Footprintz. Fabric, EC1, Sat Sam Richards Melting Pot's 11th Birthday, Glasgow Pre-9/11, while carefree clubbers partied at Club Shelter's legendary Body &amp; Soul night in deepest Tribeca, aliens in their midst Andrew Pirie, Simon Cordiner and Bill Brewster were contemplating how the music and atmosphere might translate to their native Glasgow. Very well, it turns out, as their Melting Pot night celebrates its 11th birthday tonight. From its low-key beginnings at The Riverside Club, the past decade has seen numerous one-offs across the UK, plus visits by leading DJs including original Body &amp; Soul residents and inspirations for the club's very existence Joe Claussell, Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian and Danny Krivit \u2013 indeed, Krivit fills tonight's guest slot. Despite mostly playlisting authentic New York sounds, residents and guests have freedom to play whatever takes their fancy, from disco, house and techno to soul and funk, all channelled through a vintage Urei 1620 rotary mixer: the favoured sound-shaper of almost all pioneering stateside clubs during the late-70s and early-80s. The Admiral, Waterloo Street, Sat Patric Baird Ibiza Essentials, Southampton Most visitors' idea of Ibiza essentials are a passport and a no-max credit card. Thankfully, not only does Pop's Ibiza anthems party come with a wallet-friendly door tax, they're even throwing glowsticks and percussion into the bargain. White Isle favourites come from Southampton's hometown boy Ridney, and joining him on stage are High Tide resident Boul\u00e9, plus a guest appearance from Tropics' drummer Morgan Hislop, who'll be bringing his drum pad to add extra synths and kicks.

      "body": "<h2>Fingerprint, Manchester</h2> <p>When their original home, The Attic, was forced to close due to essential works on the railway arch under which it was situated, Manchester could easily have lost young night Fingerprint. Luckily, the ambitions of residents Bill Jones, Brad Parkins and Iain Dixon meant they weren't going to give up easily. Their trademark mix of deep-to-classic American house and contemporary European flavours cropped up in back rooms at Sankeys and at Mono_cult in Leeds during their homeless stint, but now the crew are back at a regular home in Manchester, to which they invite fellow up-and-coming Manchester guest Hannah Hammond on Friday. Headlining proceedings is Terrence Parker, not the best known DJ/producer from Detroit \u2013 perhaps because he operates outside of the techno arena \u2013 but nevertheless a constant presence on the underground scene for over 20 years.</p> <p><strong><em>Joshua Brooks, Princess Street, Fri</em></strong></p> <p><em>Marc Rowlands</em></p> <h2>Visionquest, London</h2> <p>Visionquest are a musical collective formed by schoolfriends Seth Troxler, Lee Curtiss, Ryan Crosson and Shaun Reeves in Detroit back in the mid-2000s. Like a kind of techno Wu-Tang Clan, they all went on to achieve solo success, before reconvening last year to launch the Visionquest label and embark on a series of wild three-deck DJ adventures together. It proved to be so much fun that they're still at it, commandeering Fabric's main room for a night of luxuriant deep disco and celebratory tech house. In among it all, Ryan and Lee intend to premiere some new material, and there's a bonus live set from Visionquest-signed synth-pop duo Footprintz.</p> <p><strong><em>Fabric, EC1, Sat</em></strong></p> <p><em>Sam Richards</em></p> <h2>Melting Pot's 11th Birthday, Glasgow</h2> <p>Pre-9/11, while carefree clubbers partied at Club Shelter's legendary Body &amp; Soul night in deepest Tribeca, aliens in their midst Andrew Pirie, Simon Cordiner and Bill Brewster were contemplating how the music and atmosphere might translate to their native Glasgow. Very well, it turns out, as their Melting Pot night celebrates its 11th birthday tonight. From its low-key beginnings at The Riverside Club, the past decade has seen numerous one-offs across the UK, plus visits by leading DJs including original Body &amp; Soul residents and inspirations for the club's very existence Joe Claussell, Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian and Danny Krivit \u2013 indeed, Krivit fills tonight's guest slot. Despite mostly playlisting authentic New York sounds, residents and guests have freedom to play whatever takes their fancy, from disco, house and techno to soul and funk, all channelled through a vintage Urei 1620 rotary mixer: the favoured sound-shaper of almost all pioneering stateside clubs during the late-70s and early-80s.</p> <p><strong><em>The Admiral, Waterloo Street, Sat</em></strong></p> <p><em>Patric Baird</em></p> <h2>Ibiza Essentials, Southampton</h2> <p>Most visitors' idea of Ibiza essentials are a passport and a no-max credit card. Thankfully, not only does Pop's Ibiza anthems party come with a wallet-friendly door tax, they're even throwing glowsticks and percussion into the bargain. White Isle favourites come from Southampton's hometown boy Ridney, and joining him on stage are High Tide resident Boul\u00e9, plus a guest appearance from Tropics' drummer Morgan Hislop, who'll be bringing his drum pad to add extra synths and kicks.</p> <p><strong><em>Pop, Vernon Walk, Sat</em></strong></p> <p><em>John Mitchell</em></p> <h2>To The Lazer Cave, London</h2> <p>To The Lazer Cave is less of a club night, more an ongoing scientific experiment by four disco-loving Dalstonites to find out how many lasers they need to install in a blacked-out east London warehouse to achieve complete sensory overload.

      "bodyText": "Usher Climax (RCA) And so the zeitgeist takes an unexpected ricochet back in the direction of two men widely presumed to have vaulted the shark sometime last year: Usher, for being an old-fashioned R&amp;B loverman lacking the self-awareness of The Weeknd or Frank Ocean; and producer Diplo, for bodypopping like a berk on a BlackBerry Torch advert. Climax is brilliant precisely because it subverts your expectations of what a collaboration between these two should sound like. Although Diplo tweaks and teases, the Climax referred to is not a whomping everybody-in-the-club chorus, but the limp conclusion to a once passionate relationship. And when Usher sings \"don't wanna give in, so we both gave up\" he sounds genuinely bereft. Coming across like an upscale American version of SBTRKT's Hold On, it's a masterpiece of indefinitely delayed gratification. Jakwob Electrify (Boom Ting/Mercury) The polar opposite of the Usher/Diplo track in that it's exactly what you'd expect from a producer with the most uninspiring moniker in UK bass music (he might as well have called himself Kevstep, or Billex). The bass drops when you expect it to drop, the beat doubles when you expect it to double, and the vocals \u2013 courtesy of a Sand\u00e9-alike called Jetta \u2013 are full of hollow euphoria. And yet it's still kinda catchy, dammit. Dot Rotten Are You Not Entertained? (Mercury) With a name that's part-Sex Pistol part-Albert Square gossip maven, a nod to Graham Taylor's grammar, and a breakout single built around a hook from that 90s chillout tune you instantly recognise but can't put a name to (it's Clubbed To Death by Rob Dougan, proclaims the Google oracle), Dot Rotten is obviously keen to cover all the bases. But as he's just made the best grime-pop track since Pass Out, why not? Saint Etienne Tonight (Universal) After 20-odd years of trying and failing to write a bona fide pop hit yet always managing to wring poignancy from that very failure, Saint Etienne have finally coughed up a gelatinous morsel of chart-bland disco-pop that wouldn't sound out of place as a bonus track on a Sophie Ellis-Bextor best of. Um, congratulations? Marcus Collins Seven Nation Army (RCA) Yes, it's a tacky Ronson-esque swing/ska version of the White Stripes' call to arms (and a direct copy of the 2009 Ben L'Oncle Soul version at that) which even Ray Quinn would have rejected. But at a time when a twinkly, bowdlerised version of Where Is My Mind? Is being used to lure grown-up grungers into buying Thomson package holidays, that's barely worth an eyebrow-raise. Should Pixie Lott ever announce her intention to team up with David Guetta for an electro-house version of PJ Harvey's 50ft Queenie, that's when we mobilise.",

That isn't quite right, as it suggests that it somehow waters down the fantasy elements \u2013 if anything it amps them up. Put simply however, it's just great TV. It comes with the HBO stamp of quality, which generally means the people who make the show are given enough time and resources to do a decent job, then left alone to get on with it. Sounds simple, and indeed it is. Set in the seven mythical kingdoms of Westeros, the epic tale concerns a struggle for the throne by several families and factions. Go any more in depth and we'll soon be lost in muddle of strange names and places, and there isn't room here to give the intricacies and details any justice. But there is on weekly television, where the tale is stretched over 10 episodes and delivered with clarity and verve. Characters are regularly introduced in their dozens but it's always clear who they are and, more importantly, what they're after. It's the television equivalent of unputdownable, helped by a cast that contains no weak links (Sean Bean and Lena Headey take top billing with Peter Dinklage stealing any scene he's in) and sets, costumes and FX that are never less than movie quality. The Blu-ray includes plenty of optional onscreen background detail, giving information on characters and locations from any given scene, plus plenty of in-character input from the cast.

The Blu-ray includes plenty of optional onscreen background detail, giving information on characters and locations from any given scene, plus plenty of in-character input from the cast.</p> <p><em>Blu-ray/DVD, Warner</em></p> <h2><strong>Dracula: Prince Of Darkness</strong></h2> <p>Not the greatest of Christopher Lee's Dracula films, but decent enough.</p> <p><em>DVD &amp; Blu-ray, StudioCanal</em></p> <h2><strong>Ripping Yarns: The Complete Series</strong></h2> <p>Michael Palin's pitch-perfect spoofing of such Boy's Own concerns as exploring, soldiering, investigating and football.</p> <p><em>DVD, Network</em></p> <h2><strong>Contagion</strong></h2> <p>Steven Soderberg delivers a realistic, downbeat take on the deadly virus movie.</p> <p><em>DVD &amp; Blu-ray, Warner</em></p> <h2><strong>The Ides Of March</strong></h2> <p>George Clooney directs and stars in a cynical tale of politicians and ideals.</p> <p><em>DVD &amp; Blu-ray, Entertainment One</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Kinoteka Polish Film Festival, London, Belfast &amp; Edinburgh The presence of Juliette Binoche gets this festival off to a high-profile start \u2013 she plays a French journalist studying teenage prostitution in Elles. And the prestige continues with Agnieszka Holland's Oscar-nominated In Darkness, a Schindler's List-like wartime drama. More interesting though are Suicide Room, an angsty teen movie partly set in a virtual world, and Courage, mixing biblical themes with modern social commentary. This being the festival's 10th anniversary, there are also classic Polish films selected by 10 top film-makers, including Mike Leigh, Andrzej Wajda and Nicolas Roeg, plus \u2013 in London \u2013 a special concert with master composer Krzysztof Penderecki and Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. Various venues, Thu to 22 Mar BEV Springs 2012, London Sadly there weren't sufficient funds to mount a full-blown Bird's Eye View festival this year, but the event won't be kept down. So, to mark International Women's Day, there's an evening of international shorts, including films on the attempt to raise \"the world's first free woman\", and Baldguy, a Norwegian musical about making out with a hairless gent. Plus guests such as Romola Garai and screenwriter Moira Buffini. Then there's a two-part tribute to silent screen siren-cum-industry player Mary Pickford \u2013 a movie role model if ever there was one. Female artists perform new live scores to some of her classic works. Various venues, Thu to 11 Mar Slow Cinema Weekend, Newcastle upon Tyne Slow cinema: it's a term that's beginning, gradually, to gain currency in film circles, used to describe a certain brand of contemplative, minimalist cinema unconcerned with traditional narrative momentum. Certainly not everybody's cup of tea, but mainstream cinema is the equivalent of instant coffee by comparison. Part of the north-east's AV Festival, there's much to treasure in films presented here by veteran exponents such as Fred Kelemen, Argentina's Lisandro Alonso and the Philippines' Lav Diaz. No room for B\u00e9la Tarr's seven-hour magnum opus Satantango, sadly, but you do get his latest \u2013 and apparently final \u2013 film, The Turin Horse . Look out too for a couple from rising Briton Ben Rivers, including his forthcoming Two Years At Sea \u2013 a study of a Scottish hermit. Tyneside Cinema and Star And Shadow, Thu to 11 Mar Pan Asia Film Festival, London You've got your work cut out covering the whole of Asian cinema in one small festival, but the exercise starts to make sense with movies like 3.11: A Sense Of Home \u2013 short-film responses to last year's Japanese tsunami by the likes of Japan's Naomi Kawase, Korea's Bong Joon-ho, China's Jia Zhangke and Thailand's Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Or, for that matter, Mother's Paradise, a study of hardship in Kazakhstan with a script from Iran's Mohsen Makhmalbaf. Three And A Half , follows young women on a three-day release from prison in Iran, and elsewhere, heavyweights like Wang Xiaoshuai's 11 Flowers, a childhood drama set during the Cultural Revolution, sit alongside obscurities like One More, about ice hockey in the Himalayas, and The Sun Beaten Path, a scenic Tibetan road movie.

      "bodyText": "Michael (18) (Markus Schleinzer) Michael Fuith, David Rauchenberger, Gisella Salcher. 96 mins The daily routine of an Austrian paedophile who keeps a young boy locked in his cellar was hardly something anyone was queuing up to see, but this challenges us, and itself, to take a look. At the same time, it thankfully averts its gaze from scenes of actual abuse. There are keen observations on parenting, privacy, power relations and more, but the flat, factual approach verges on dull, and the absence of empathy ultimately just leaves you feeling grubby. So get in line for the grimmest movie of the year! This Means War (12A) (McG, 2012, US) Chris Pine, Tom Hardy, Reese Witherspoon. 98 mins Two suspiciously close CIA buddies fall out when they discover they're dating the same woman \u2013 cue the misuse of government equipment and their own combat skills for one-upmanship. The romcom high concept is novel for a good reason: it's completely ridiculous. Project X (18) (Nima Nourizadeh, 2012, US) Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, Jonathan Daniel Brown. 88 mins There's a thin line between \"mother of all high-school party movies\" and \"bunch of recycled party movie cliches\", and this amped-up teen comedy treads it shakily. Wanderlust (15) (David Wain, 2012, US) Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd, Malin Akerman. 98 mins A downwardly mobile couple get out of New York and explore alternative lifestyle options in this amiably absurd comedy, which has as much fun with weirdo eco-hippy caricatures as it does with straight-world wage slavery. Hunky Dory (15) (Marc Evans, 2011, UK) Minnie Driver, Aneurin Barnard, Danielle Branch. 110 mins High School Musical-meets-Dead Poets Society in 1970s Wales, with Driver's driven schoolteacher corralling her hormonal teens into a rock opera version of the Tempest. Carancho (15) (Pablo Trapero, 2010, Arg) Ricardo Dar\u00edn, Martina Gusman, Carlos Weber. 108 mins A novel setting for a neo-noir thriller: Buenos Aires' lethal roadscape and the shady industry that's sprung up around it. Blank City (NC) (Celine Danhier, 2010, US) 94 mins A history of New York's 1970s/80s no wave punk film-making scene, with choice talking heads (Jim Jarmusch, Lydia Lunch, Nick Zedd, Debbie Harry, etc). Khodorkovsky (12A) (Cyril Tuschi, 2011, Ger) 117 mins Documentary on Russia's famous billionaire prisoner and Putin-baiter that's timely and watchable, but by no means authoritative. If Not Us, Who? (15) (Andres Veiel, 2011, Ger) August Diehl. Lena Lauzemis, Alexander Fehling. 126 mins A faithful dramatisation of Bernward Vesper and Gudrun Ensslin, two bohemian German leftists. Breaking Wind (15) (Craig Moss, 2011, US) Heather Ann Davis, Eric Callero, Frank Pacheco. 79 mins Scatologically inclined Twilight spoof that's as much fun as a fart in a coffin. London Paris New York (12A) (Anu Menon, 2012, Ind) Ali Zafar, Aditi Rao Hydari. 100 mins Three cities, one long-running Indian romance. Out from Friday Bel Ami Robert Pattinson sleeps his way up the social ladder in 19th-century Paris. Madam Butterfly The Royal Opera House's production, live, in 3D. Out from Mon John Carter Is there life in Pixar's live-action Martian fantasy epic? Trishna Freida Pinto leads an Indian interpretation of Hardy's Tess. The Raven John Cusack plays Edgar Allan Poe \u2013 on the hunt for a copycat murderer. The Decoy Bride Kelly Macdonald and David Tennant in a Scottish romcom. Hard Boiled Sweets Gangster thriller set in the seamy side of Southend. Payback Season Brit urban drama centred on a footballer (Adam Deacon).

      "bodyText": "This isn't just an advert. It's a sprawling episodic \"journey\", much like Lord Of The Rings or Game Of Thrones (puns both, regrettably, intended), only instead of lowly underdogs rising up to overcome an insidious, all-consuming evil, we just have Dawn Porter loitering around toilets, awkwardly forcing passers-by to give their muck-flutes a once over with a soggy tissue. While she waits right outside the door with a film crew. The \"journey\" begins with Dawn's profound existential befuddlement at the very concept of \"moist tissues\", but after some serious soul-sifting, she's soon gleefully squeegeeing like a trooper, while giving us a grisly flush-by-flush account of her \"journey\". Three days pass \u2026 She loves them! Apparently, she can't remember a time before these revolutionary bum flannels existed, and, with numbing inevitability, is now ready to \"hit the streets\" and \"spread the word\".

The Tube didn't seem much on paper, billed as a behind-the-scenes look at the revamp of a Victorian infrastructure, talking to CEOs, litter-pickers and construction workers, but it turned out to have something for everyone. It's a show for transport geeks who find bliss in secret stations, emergency cleaning staff code words and control-room \"banter\". Lovers of London can see the capital's capillary system through fresh eyes. Haters can laugh at the fact we pay thousands per year to travel, crammed like canned apricots, considering it \"a good journey\" if one's face isn't wholly enveloped by a hirsute man's bum crevice.

An eerie shift takes place in the way we see human beings once we flash our Oyster cards and enter the tube network.

      "bodyText": "I'm properly back at work now and, with a big storyline coming up in the next few months, I'm spending a fair amount of time on the Corrie cobbles or, as Georgia calls it, \"Daddy's Manchester\". It's actually great to be back, everyone has been really supportive through Hal's bumpy start, and lots of the cast and crew have young kids, so understand how tough the juggling can be. And, despite me constantly reminding Catherine and Cam that when I head up north, I'm not on some jolly, I'm actually working, the truth is that I do get a break from the rigours of family life. Last week, for example, I was able to go out to dinner after work and then home to unbroken sleep and a lie-in until 7.30am \u2013 a luxury for any new parent. Talking about life instead of just babies, sharing a bottle (or two) of wine with friends ... I felt like a grown-up. It was nice. Before Hal was born, my friend Tara, who has two young kids, told me that when the second one comes along, the work isn't doubled \u2013 it's squared. I know what she means now and can only say thank God for Peppa Pig and Show Me Show Me (Chris and Pui, I owe you a drink!). The thing you just don't realise until you're a parent is how bloody relentless it is. Kids don't stop for weekends or holidays. The cycle of feeding and cleaning and entertaining never lets up, not for a minute, and even with three of us, handling a newborn and a two-year old is pretty full-on. When it was just Georgia, we all got a break regularly. Now we're all juggling much more. Don't get me wrong, we're doing fine and everyone seems to be thriving, but we're still immensely grateful to our amazing family and friends who show up with casseroles and curries from time to time. I'm also aware that this stage won't last for ever. Georgia will be going to school in less than two years, and I know how fast Hal's babyhood is going to fly by. Even though it's hectic, it's important to try to remember to treasure it all because I know, they really aren't small for very long. At work, ironically, my storyline is centred around my character's desire to have kids. Obviously, it's something I can relate to as I spent years wrestling with the same issues. My character also has a lot of scenes with a couple of young kids which, as is normal in soaps, are both played by a set of twins. So there are four children hurtling about the place. It's different when they're not your own, though. All the fun and none of the responsibility. When one of my little co-stars gets hungry or grumpy, someone else steps in to sort them out. I imagine that's what having a nanny is like. Not everything about being back at work is good. The travelling is hard and not fun. On Wednesday, I spent all day in the Rovers \u2013 actually a cramped, airless room \u2013 then immediately got the train back to London, arriving home at 11pm and collapsing straight into bed. And it's hard being away from Cam. I miss him, of course, and I worry about him getting enough time for his own working life. Because he's a freelancer, it's easy for his work to get sidelined and that's really not fair. We're trying to find the right balance, but I'm not sure we're there yet. But when I've been away for a couple of days, and I come back to be met by Georgia rushing to throw her arms around me and smother me with sticky kisses, there's no better feeling, and I really know I'm home.

      "body": "<p>I'm properly back at work now and, with a big storyline coming up in the next few months, I'm spending a fair amount of time on the Corrie cobbles or, as Georgia calls it, \"Daddy's Manchester\". It's actually great to be back, everyone has been really supportive through Hal's bumpy start, and lots of the cast and crew have young kids, so understand how tough the juggling can be. And, despite me constantly reminding Catherine and Cam that when I head up north, I'm not on some jolly, I'm actually working, the truth is that I do get a break from the rigours of family life. Last week, for example, I&#xa0;was able to go out to dinner after work and then home to unbroken sleep and a lie-in until 7.30am \u2013 a luxury for any new parent. Talking about life instead of just babies, sharing a bottle (or two) of wine with friends ... I felt like a&#xa0;grown-up. It was nice.</p> <p>Before Hal was born, my friend Tara, who has two young kids, told me that when the second one comes along, the work isn't doubled \u2013 it's squared. I know what she means now and can only say thank God for Peppa Pig and Show Me Show Me (Chris and Pui, I owe you a drink!). The thing you just don't realise until you're a parent is how bloody relentless it is. Kids don't stop for weekends or holidays. The cycle of feeding and cleaning and entertaining never lets up, not for a minute, and even with three of us, handling a newborn and a two-year old is pretty full-on. When it was just Georgia, we all got a break regularly. Now we're all juggling much more.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong, we're doing fine and everyone seems to be thriving, but we're still immensely grateful to our amazing family and friends who show up with casseroles and curries from time to time.</p> <p>I'm also aware that this stage won't last for ever. Georgia will be going to school in less than two years, and I know how fast Hal's babyhood is going to fly by. Even though it's hectic, it's important to try to remember to treasure it all because I know, they really aren't small for very long.</p> <p>At work, ironically, my storyline is centred around my character's desire to have kids. Obviously, it's something I can relate to as I spent years wrestling with the same issues. My character also has a lot of scenes with a couple of young kids which, as is normal in soaps, are both played by a set of twins. So there are four children hurtling about the place. It's different when they're not your own, though. All the fun and none of the responsibility. When one of my little co-stars gets hungry or grumpy, someone else steps in to sort them out. I imagine that's what having a nanny is like.</p> <p>Not everything about being back&#xa0;at work is good. The travelling is hard and not fun.

      "bodyText": "Cecily, my mother, was born in 1930, in rooms off the Holloway Road in north London. Her father, a hand-for-hire with a weak heart, died of pneumonia six weeks before she was born. Her mother, Esther, had no money to pay the hospital bill and no widow's pension. When a deputation from the council arrived to take Mum into care, she was fought over on the doorstep. My grandmother won: a doctor present at the birth paid the bill. So Cecily grew up with her beloved mother, proved bright, went to art college, taught for some years, married and had four children, of whom I am the youngest. She was a woman of the mid-century: an evacuee, a working-class girl who went to grammar school and graduated into the middle classes. Thankfulness for what she had achieved at times shaded over into perplexity and vexation. We were brought up in Bath in relative comfort. Because our experiences were not hers she could be vehement about our ignorance of hardship. The house was very cold, but that hardly counted. When I was seven or so, Mum read me The Long Winter, by Laura Ingalls Wilder, a book I loved for introducing me to the idea of \"blizzards\". In a remote South Dakotan outpost, Laura, the hardy pioneer girl, awakes to find her blanket caked with snow and ice. My room had a similar ambient temperature, with frost crazing the inside of the glass, and I seem to remember pointing this out. Mum was an artist and a practical wife; a good cook and, like her mother before her, an excellent needlewoman. She tended her garden and let her children's store of interests and demands become her own. She drew a little when we were older and leaving, or about to leave, home. But what she did more than anything else was write letters: to friends, to relatives; letters to us if we were away; letters to school if there were problems. These made my teachers laugh. She was anxious on my behalf \u2013 I was small for my age, and indefinably annoying to my friends, as immature teenagers tend to be. When would my balls drop? Letters by the yard, then, and along with them one or two more private, unsent epistles that came to light when, finally, she went into care. The longest of these unsent letters begins with a definition of \"thrift\" (\"saving ways, sparing expenditure\") and \"thriftlessness\" (\"wastage that is unwise, unjust\"). The tone is occasionally embattled (\"although not a Victorian myself, I am the child of one\"), as if her reader were someone against whom she felt the need to defend herself. She is of course the authority figure in question, the middle-class woman whose social mobility and aspirations represented a sort of fork in the timeline of the self. One Cecily Crocker became Cecily Eaves and had a gay son who wrote stories and poems; another went on existing in her imagination, and quite possibly didn't pass her 11-plus, or, when mocked by a pompous headmistress for her \"awful Cockney accent\", instead of growing quietly determined, left school at 15. She was loyal to the idea of a home she'd left behind. It's a common enough quality: we wish to have, and to conserve, a myth of belonging. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Except that our memory of formative events is a shifting, dynamic process: a matter of some fact and quite a lot of reshaping to fit our current circumstances. It isn't stable \u2013 and the more anxious we are about holding on to one version of the past, the more difficult it becomes; the more the present is apt to strike us as a series of betrayals. Cecily told and retold the story of her childhood escape from care when her own mother sickened and had to go into a nursing home. Esther Crocker was blind and helpless. Mum felt, as many others have done, that by handing her over she had betrayed her parent, her kind, and her class. I was still at school in Bath in the mid-1980s. She went to see Esther every day, and was often tearful in the evening. Their shared background was a comfort, but also an accusing reminder of a standard of suffering and sacrifice to which Mum may have felt herself unequal. I was not very sympathetic at the time. The \"home\" that wasn't home seemed unreal. I did not understand that she was afraid. That fear resurfaced when Cecily was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2003. Our efforts \u2013 my father's, in particular \u2013 to keep her at home as long as possible conformed to her own wishes. Or did they? In retrospect, none of us could recall with any certainty exactly what she'd said about this, but we were sure of \"what she wanted\". The desire to remain in family surroundings went along with an atavistic, class-based fear of being sent away; of being judged and found wanting, materially and morally. The probable interpretation of someone's wishes may not be the right one, or may not go on being right. In early 2005, Dad and I took Mum out for an evening, to Pizza Express. It was a difficult meal. She clung to the table and knocked over a glass of juice. She became distressed; Dad was exhausted. A few weeks later I came to Bath again and looked after Mum while he went away. That weekend, during a lucid spell quite as disorientating as the muddle it relieved, Mum said: \"I think I'd be better if \u2026 if I were somewhere \u2026\" She was asking to be released from the clasp of affection, and from our prior assumption about where she would like to be. This is a personal interpretation, but I wonder whether the loss of certain strands of my mother's identity was altogether a terrible thing. Her myth of origin was a source of terrific pride: it underpinned a sense of her individuality within the family. It also caused her continuing distress \u2013 and when that distress, with its mixture of guilt and longing, disappeared, it seemed to me that she was free to inhabit a magnified present, whose possibilities were bright, sad and joyful. The conserved aspect of memory packed up, like a hard drive. The dynamic component \u2013 the lit screen \u2013 flickered on. She let me dance with her at my sister's house. In the care home's sunny dining-room, she lapped up platefuls of jam and semolina, saying: \"Oh, it's lovely.\" I think she perceived colours in a different way, too, because she pointed them out to us all, in the buddleia she saw from her window, in her purple skirt, in beads and clouds. She didn't choose to go into care. That would be overstating matters. But I do think that the change in mind she underwent, pathologically, was complemented at a crucial stage by a change of mind. She left one home that had served its purpose for another, in a former mining village whose working-class origins were not wholly alien to her. There she was looked after by overstretched staff who lavished affection on her and treated her with dignity. They all came to her funeral and one lady wrote a poem for her. The letter that enclosed the poem read simply: \"I'm so glad that we had the chance to care for Cecily while she was with us.\" So am I.

      "bodyText": "I got a message from Mark, the aspiring sitcom writer this week. I have been really, really hopeless with Mark since dumping him by email after three dates. For a while he kept in what felt to me like oppressively close touch, emailing and texting and suggesting we go out for a drink. In return, I behaved like an evasive weasel, expressing generic positive thoughts about the \"going out for a drink\" scenario, then going silent or finding an excuse whenever he suggested a concrete date. Finally he got quite cross and asked if I really wanted to see him again and I said that he was putting too much pressure on me and that no, if he kept being so insistent, I wouldn't actually want to see him again. A fairly poor performance in the maturity stakes from both of us, really. This email, coming after a break of a month or so, amused and appalled me in equal measure. On the one hand it was conciliatory and thoughtful: he said he was in a \"strange place\" in his life when he met me and he knew he had been far too pushy when I had been very clear about wanting to keep things very casual. On the other hand, I found it hard to concentrate on his apology once he used the expression: \"lazy sex\" in describing our abortive relationship. Lazy sex? In context, it was obviously not intended to be insulting, but somehow it doesn't sound great either. \"Lazy?\" Am I lazy? I wonder. I didn't just lie there with a pained expression, did I, like some Victorian newlywed being ... bothered? I think back, slightly nervously and come to the conclusion that lazy or not, the kind of sex we had is the only kind I know how to \"do\". This makes it worse, somehow. No one likes to think they're not very good at sex, but even so, I'm inclined to think it might be true of me. We're all supposed to be GGG, \"good, giving and game\", according to the wise and funny US agony uncle Dan Savage: I'm not even sure I can muster one out of three. \"Stilted, vanilla and inarticulate\" doesn't have quite the same ring to it, does it? Having stewed over the email for a few days, I'm considering take holy orders and giving up the life of the flesh altogether, but instead I confide in my best friend. \"It's not necessarily a bad thing, laziness,\" she says, when I tell her, but she doesn't sound entirely convincing. \"It's not great though, is it? It's not 'the sex was mind-blowing, I scaled hitherto unimaginable erotic heights'.\" \"Well, you obviously didn't think that either, did you?\" she points out, very reasonably. \"Or you'd have been keener to see him again.\" \"That's true.\" I check with my other friend Anna. \"Do you think I might be bad at sex?\" \"Oh,\" she says reassuringly, \"I don't think it's really possible to be very bad at sex. A little enthusiasm goes a long way. That, and blow jobs.\" I'm still not sure though. Being separated is a bit like being 14 again in this respect. \"Am I normal?\" I ask myself repeatedly, but this time, there's no Just 17 problem page to put me at ease. It's funny. Sex \u2013 wanting sex with other people \u2013 was a big part of why we broke up, but I've surprised myself with how much I actually miss \"married\" sex. The sex I (occasionally) have now is more exciting in prospect: there's the uncertainty, the novelty, that moment of happy realisation that indeed, you haven't imagined it, this person does want to sleep with you. It carries a tiny but powerful vindication: yes, I can be desirable. But sometimes that moment is actually the best bit: the actual sex that follows can be awkward, strange, comic and very lonely. It's easy to feel vulnerable or uncomfortable with someone you don't actually know very well and those aren't the best circumstances for losing yourself in the moment. Sex in a long-term relationship is often lazy, I suppose: it's sex where you both know what you want and need and how to get it without superhuman effort. It can be selfish, or opportunistic, or an accident of proximity: it's the kind of sex where you might not even bother to get undressed. I miss that easy shorthand you have with a long-term partner, the instinct you develop about another body and its reactions. I mean intimacy, I suppose. Intimacy is ... not having to make an effort? I don't think Dan Savage would approve.",

I&#xa0;didn't just lie there with a pained expression, did I, like some Victorian newlywed being ... bothered? I think back, slightly nervously and come to the conclusion that lazy or not, the kind of sex we had is the only kind I know how to \"do\". This makes it worse, somehow.</p> <p>No one likes to think they're not very good at sex, but even so, I'm inclined to think it might be true of me. We're all supposed to be GGG, \"good, giving and game\", according to the wise and funny US agony uncle Dan Savage: I'm not even sure I can muster one out of three. \"Stilted, vanilla and inarticulate\" doesn't have quite the same ring to it, does it?</p> <p>Having stewed over the email for a few days, I'm considering take holy orders and giving up the life of the flesh altogether, but instead I confide in my best friend.</p> <p>\"It's not necessarily a bad thing, laziness,\" she says, when I tell her, but she doesn't sound entirely convincing.</p> <p>\"It's not great though, is it? It's not 'the sex was mind-blowing, I scaled hitherto unimaginable erotic heights'.\"</p> <p>\"Well, you obviously didn't think that either, did you?\" she points out, very reasonably. \"Or you'd have been keener to see him again.\"</p> <p>\"That's true.\"</p> <p>I check with my other friend Anna. \"Do you think I might be bad at sex?\"</p> <p>\"Oh,\" she says reassuringly, \"I don't think it's really possible to be very bad at sex. A little enthusiasm goes a long way. That, and blow jobs.\"</p> <p>I'm still not sure though. Being separated is a bit like being 14 again in this respect. \"Am I normal?\" I ask myself repeatedly, but this time, there's no Just 17 problem page to put me at ease.</p> <p>It's funny. Sex \u2013 wanting sex with other people \u2013 was a big part of why we broke up, but I've surprised myself with how much I actually miss \"married\" sex. The sex I (occasionally) have now is more exciting in prospect: there's the uncertainty, the novelty, that moment of happy realisation that indeed, you haven't imagined it, this person does want to sleep with you. It carries a tiny but powerful vindication: yes, I can be desirable.</p> <p>But sometimes that moment is actually the best bit: the actual sex that follows can be awkward, strange, comic and very lonely. It's easy to feel vulnerable or uncomfortable with someone you don't actually know very well and those aren't the best circumstances for losing yourself in the moment.</p> <p>Sex in a long-term relationship is often lazy, I suppose: it's sex where you both know what you want and need and how to get it without superhuman effort. It can be selfish, or opportunistic, or an accident of proximity: it's the kind of sex where you might not even bother to get undressed.</p> <p>I miss that easy shorthand you have with a long-term partner, the instinct you develop about another body and its reactions. I mean intimacy, I&#xa0;suppose.</p> <p>Intimacy is ... not having to make an effort? I don't think Dan Savage would approve.</p>",

Like the time I got out of my depth beyond the breakers at Woolacombe and shouted \"Help!\" and a young surfer pushed his board out to me and towed me to a place where I could stand again. But this time I didn't shout. I couldn't. My mother was dying in hospital. She'd had a massive stroke which had robbed her of speech and movement, and no one could tell us how long she would stay like that. So Dad and I established a routine. Dad went to the hospital in the morning and I'd do the afternoon visit. In the evening we went together. It was probably the most difficult thing I've ever done. In that clinical, alien place Mum was just a body. A body with problems. No one there knew her for the capable, vibrant woman she really was. On this day, the one that concerns you, Dad wanted to take a gift in to Mum. Her bedside was already full of flowers, so he asked me to buy a pretty dressing gown on my way home. It sounded easy. I popped into Marks &amp; Spencer, remembered the right size, and managed, after much uncertainty, to make a choice between the predominantly pink and predominantly green. Then I found there were two lengths. And I froze. It was one choice too many. I couldn't do it. All the sadness and uncertainty of that week came together and enveloped me, and I was rooted to the spot. I looked at my watch. I had only just enough time to make the purchase if I was to get back in time for Dad to have his tea and take it to evening visiting, as he wanted. The more I became aware of the minutes ticking past, the more my hesitation grew. Did I want the long one or the short one? Suddenly I was beyond the point of being able to make a decision at all. Then you arrived. You looked like any ordinary busy woman, with a full shopping bag on each arm, taking the short cut through the store, from the shopping centre to the street. When you came up to me staring fixedly at the dressing gowns, you nodded cheerfully and said: \"They are pretty, aren't they?\" \"Yes,\" I replied wretchedly. \"They are very pretty, but I don't know which length to get.\" How did you know I was desperate? What was it about me that made you put down both your shopping bags and inspect the rack as though this was the most important decision of the day? We discussed size and colour. I told you why I needed it. Then you carefully, thoughtfully said: \"Well, is there any chance your mother might be in a wheelchair?\" \"Oh yes,\" I replied, \"they put her into one every morning.\" \" Ah,\" you said very definitely. \"Well I do know that the long one is too long for anyone in a wheelchair.\" I thanked you and rushed off to buy the short, pink, size 14 dressing gown. I didn't see you after that. I often wondered later, were you just an ordinary shopper? Or were you really an angel in disguise? What I do know is that you enabled me to pick myself up, and carry on to deal with the most difficult days of my life. I've often wished you could have known that. Sue Hunter",

      "bodyText": "Snapshot: A relic of my Russian-Jewish past Apart from the gleaming brass samovar \u2013 unused for a good 70 years \u2013 atop a chest in my sister's home this photograph is the only survivor of my grandparents' life in the Old Country, as Jews called those places in a distant eastern Europe they had fled. In their case, it was a Russian shtetl (little town). Under a changed name, it's in today's Lithuania, this place they never spoke of, this life experience not in any way transmitted to their children or grandchildren, of which I am one. I found a picture of the town in the Lithuanian encyclopaedia, a street with those low Eastern European rural houses and once or twice I met Lithuanians and asked about the region, which is apparently very beautiful. They remarked that the Lithuanians were great friends to the Jews and never harmed them. That a thousand years of Jewish life should be buried in lies is nothing compared to the massacre that destroyed all branches of my family over there. The silence of the grandparents must have been their way of dealing with that loss and assuring the tranquillity of their (safely British born) descendants, perhaps. But when I look at this picture of my then teenaged grandmother with her own mother, sedate in their Chekhov-era dresses \u2013 young Rivke with a high-school medal around her neck \u2013 I wonder about the cherry orchard, the muddy roads of the thaw and what it was like riding on wagons from shtetl to shtetl, laughing and joking shyly in our dear departed language, Yiddish. In the photo my granny, mayn bube, reveals tender eyes and firm lips. This tenderness and firmness accompanied her through two marriages and the long, illegal trip from Russia \u2013 in 1903 or 1904 \u2013 her raising of a family in London's East End and later Ladbroke Grove, then getting her all her children into medical school, teacher training and professional, skilled work. This was all somehow accomplished on the wages of her husband, my melancholy but humorous grandfather, Zayde Reuven, a casually employed tailor. How she managed all that is covered with another canopy of silence but I know the bond of my own mother's affection for her and note the hopeful, clever eyes that gaze out of this token of our old Jewish-Russian life that, along with the samovar, is its silent witness. Ray Keenoy Playlist: The sound of fantasy and adventure Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves by Cher \"I was born in the wagon of a travellin' show/My mama used to dance for the money they'd throw\" Hearing this song has always been a thrill. I was obsessed (between eight and 11 years old) by the thought that I was really a Gypsy child, and that my parents had adopted me. I never owned the single, only heard it on the radio, which was always on in our house. We lived in the countryside, with several acres of garden, adjoining fields and river to play in. I didn't realise how lucky I was, or how much freedom I had. I spent as much time as I could dressing up like a Gypsy (or as they were portrayed in my story books). I was desperately keen to walk barefoot and practised on the pebble path in the garden, trying to toughen up my feet, which hurt. My father gave me a penknife and I learned how to make whistles and tried to make pegs. I recently discovered that Dervish, an Irish band, does a cover of this song, which is lovely, but doesn't have the impact of the original. I am pleased that my 11-year-old daughter loves this track, but, as we live in the city, it would be social suicide for her to indulge her fantasies by getting into character. I do now own a lurcher, (a greyhound-collie-cross hunting dog) another essential element of the Gypsy lifestyle, but as I am a vegetarian I discourage him from catching rabbits. Bridget Barling We love to eat: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang fudge Ingredients 1lb (450g) soft light brown sugar (white granulated will do) 4oz (115g) unsalted butter 1 tbsp golden syrup 2 fl oz (60ml) water 3 fl oz (90ml) cream 1 tsp vanilla essence Melt all ingredients except the vanilla in a high-sided pot on a low heat. When the sugar has dissolved, bring the fudge to the boil until it reaches soft ball stage \u2013 drip a drop into a cup of cold water; if it forms a ball, it's ready \u2013 Take it off the stove and beat in the vanilla. Pour into a greased pan and cut while still warm. In 1966 my family emigrated to Canada from England. One day, a few weeks after we arrived, I found myself barred from the kitchen. My mother and sister were \"making something secret\". After what seemed like forever, my sister came out with a pan of fudge. The smell was lovely and chocolatey, the taste fabulous. The original recipe is from the back of Ian Fleming's novel Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, borrowed from the library that day. But over years of making it we discovered we preferred a vanilla version made with light brown sugar and a bit of cream, and this we have stuck with. My interaction with the fudge is legendary. When I was 15 or so I made a batch (almost a kilo of fudge), ate it within two days, felt I hadn't had enough and made more, similarly devoured. I felt ill for at least a week and broke out in zits that took months to clear. For more than 30 years I couldn't go near the stuff. But then I made a batch and found myself back where I started: unable to stop eating it. I make this fudge occasionally with my own children, who show every sign of my own weakness.

      "bodyText": "I fell in love with a married man. He was 20 years older than me and had three teenage children. We embarked on an affair. He said he would not leave his children while they were young and I agreed to wait. I reached my late 20s and wanted to have a child with him. He reluctantly agreed, as long as I accepted that I would raise the child on my own for the first two years, while he waited for his older children to reach 18. We had a daughter together. He vanished two weeks prior to the birth, only to reappear a day after our baby was born. Another two years passed, and I got pregnant again. I told him that I was pregnant; he didn't react, kissed me and my daughter and left to do some shopping. He texted a couple of hours later, saying I had duped him into the pregnancy and that he wasn't coming back. We didn't see him for nearly a year. One day he turned up, asking to see my three-month-old son and admitted that he had made a mistake in turning his back on us. We resumed a friendship \u2013 no relationship \u2013 and he came to see the children a couple of times a month for the next four years. He was a good dad during this time, and had a good relationship with both children, who adored him. He was still living with his first family, who had no idea about us. One evening he told me he still loved me and that he had made a mistake. To my great amazement he told his wife and children about us and left them. But three months later he announced that he was going back to his wife and family. He promised our children that he would still see them and be the best dad he could be. He kept to the access plan for about three months, and then the lapses began. Eventually, he emailed to say that his wife was unhappy with him seeing the children, and that as he had never wanted them in the first place (his words), he wouldn't be seeing them again. Three years have since passed and he still refuses to see our children, now aged 10 and eight. When he happens to see them in the street, he walks past them. My children have had a terrible time trying to deal with the rejection. How do I move on? R, via email I'm glad that you have decided to move on, because you really need to. From what you've told me (and I acknowledge it is just one side of the story) this man sounds weak and indecisive (he leaves his children by text? By email?). But here's the thing: so are you.

      "body": "<p><strong>I fell in love with a married man. He was 20 years older than me and had three teenage children. We embarked on an affair. He said he would not leave his children while they were young and I agreed to wait. I reached my late 20s and wanted to have a child with him. He reluctantly agreed, as long as I accepted that I would raise the child on my own for the first two years, while he waited for his older children to reach 18. </strong></p> <p><strong>We had a daughter together. He vanished two weeks prior to the birth, only to reappear a day after our baby was born. Another two years passed, and I got pregnant again. I told him that I was pregnant; he didn't react, kissed me and my daughter and left to do some shopping. He texted a couple of hours later, saying I had duped him into the pregnancy and that he wasn't coming back. </strong></p> <p><strong>We didn't see him for nearly a year. One day he turned up, asking to see my three-month-old son and admitted that he had made a mistake in turning his back on us. We&#xa0;resumed&#xa0;a friendship \u2013 no relationship \u2013 and he came to see the children a couple of times a month for the next four years. </strong></p> <p><strong>He was a good dad during this time, and had a good relationship with both children, who adored him. He was still living with his first family, who had no idea about us. One evening he told me he still loved me and that he had made a mistake. To my great amazement he told his wife and children about us and left them. But three months later he announced that he was going back to his wife and family. </strong></p> <p><strong>He promised our children that he would still see them and be the best dad he could be. He kept to the access plan for about three months, and then the lapses began. Eventually, he emailed to say that his wife was unhappy with him seeing the children, and that as he had never wanted them in the first place (his words), he wouldn't be seeing them again. </strong></p> <p><strong>Three years have since passed and he still refuses to see our children, now aged 10 and eight. When he happens to see them in the street, he walks past them. My children have had a terrible time trying to deal with the rejection. How do I move on?</strong></p> <p><strong><em>R, via email</em></strong></p> <p>I'm glad that you have decided to move on, because you really need&#xa0;to. From what you've told me (and I acknowledge it is just one side of&#xa0;the story) this man sounds weak and&#xa0;indecisive (he leaves his children by text? By email?). But here's the thing: so are you. I would not be surprised if he had a third family somewhere. You were naive to get involved with this man. Starting a family in secret is never a good foundation for a life together.</p> <p>I consulted Dr Dorothy Judd (www.childpsychotherapy.org.uk), a child and adult psychotherapist.

      "bodyText": "Scottish voters could be offered even greater freedoms on taxation and social policy after Labour said it would consider \"radical\" new powers under devolution. A Labour party commission has been set up by the Scottish Labour leader, Johann Lamont, in an attempt to develop an alternative to Alex Salmond's proposals for independence, which are due to be put to a referendum in autumn 2014. Senior party sources admit this process could eventually lead Labour to propose constitutional and political reforms in Westminster and other parts of the UK, to avoid Scotland's new powers creating further tensions with the rest of the UK, or raise questions about the role of Scottish MPs at Westminster. Lamont will tell the Scottish Labour conference in Dundee that the party would consider greater devolution at all levels of government within Scotland, a measure that could lead to substantial local council reform and potentially new local taxes. She will admit that new proposals are essential to prove to disillusioned voters that Labour has fresh ideas to offer after its humiliation in last May's Scottish parliament elections, when \"the party got the kind of beating we deserved.\" She is expected to say that further devolution does not just mean shifting powers from London to Edinburgh. \"If we believe in devolution, we must be more radical than that and ask at which level power should lie if we are to serve the people. Our test is what is in the best interests of the people of Scotland,\" she will tell delegates. Her announcement follows direct attacks on Salmond and the Scottish National party in a speech by UK party leader Ed Miliband on Friday He accused the first minister of seeking only \"separation, division, isolation\" as the solution for the country's poorest. \"If we are going to create a fairer tax system, we must avoid the race to the bottom on tax rates that separation would import,\" he said. \"And if we believe in the idea of Scotland as a progressive beacon, why would we turn our back on the redistributive union, the United Kingdom?\" He went on: \"Right now, every nation in the UK, every child in poverty, every young person out of work, every small business struggling, needs solidarity, not isolation.\" Labour's commission has been preceded recently by open admissions by Alistair Darling, the former chancellor, and Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, that the Scottish parliament will need new tax powers which could see it raising nearly all the \u00a330bn it spends each year, independently of the Treasury. Lamont will also play down expectations that Labour would propose sweeping tax-raising powers on corporation tax, or devolve significant powers on welfare or social security benefits, in a sideswipe at Salmond's recent demands. A party official said it would have to take a \"cold\" look at the impact of new taxes on the whole of the UK. \"I will not be seduced into the place where which powers you demand is a test of pollitical virility. Where calling for corporation tax to be devolved somehow makes you harder, or more Scottish, or even more progressive,\" she will tell delegates. It is the latest in a series of initiatives to consider giving Scotland greater autonomy than under existing plans, the so-called \"devo plus\" option. As things stand, Holyrood is in line to gain new powers only over income tax rates, which will come into force in about 2016. Repeated opinion polls have shown that more Scottish voters favour devo plus than independence, but Labour has until now resisted promising a significant transfer of power. The Liberal Democrats are now investigating greater devolution in a \"home rule\" commission led by Menzies Campbell. Last month, David Cameron said the Tories could offer further powers too, but only after the referendum. Lamont's commission will be set up later this spring, but unlike the Lib Dems' review, will include only Scottish Labour MPs, MSPs, councillors and trade union leaders. It will not include figures from the voluntary sector, churches or business. Senior Labour figures admit that proposing detailed new powers at this stage could backfire, by helping Salmond to challenge them with a question on enhanced devolution at the referendum. The first minister has insisted he wants the option of putting two questions on the referendum ballot paper, and has resisted pressure from David Cameron and Labour to pose just one \"yes or no\" question on independence on the voting paper. So far, no political party or campaign group has offered to support a second question or to campaign for it but in a speech on Friday, Salmond fed growing suspicions that he would ask it anyway, and force Labour and the Lib Dems to tell voters why they would not campaign for it in the referendum. Speaking at a Times conference on the independence, Salmond said these opinion polls showed that current devolution structures were \"unsustainable\". That presented the UK parties with a dilemma. \"There is a growing need for those parties who are against independence to set out what they actually stand for,\" he said. \"It is something of a paradox that the people most urgently calling for an early referendum are the ones who are currently least equipped to argue their case in any campaign. \"Without a clear statement of what Scotland might look like in future within the union, the case against independence is inevitably based more on a negative view of Scotland's potential than a positive vision of the future.\"",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Ruff, London Thomas Ruff's manipulated images hark back to photography's early status as a kind of magic show, rendering life freshly marvellous and strange. One of art photography's heavy hitters, past experiments include turning photos of modernist interiors into illusory three-dimensional spaces with stereoscopic mirrored boxes and magnifying images of distant planets to the point that their surfaces dissolve. This double bill at Gagosian's London galleries sees him tackle two very different objects of fantasy. For nudes he takes images of internet porn, enlarging them to the point that the raw exposure of the performers' bodies becomes a more suggestive haze of pixels. ma.r.s. meanwhile sees him adapt black-and-white Nasa images of the red planet, flooding them with colour to create giant painterly prints and even rendering some of the works in 3D. Gagosian, Britannia Street, WC1 and Davies Street, W1, Thu to 21 Apr Skye Sherwin Lisa Milroy, Newcastle upon Tyne For this show, titled Ivory Lamp Mars Vine Bone, Lisa Milroy has selected paintings from 1984 to 2011 that demonstrate her highly imaginative use of black. Emerging in the 1980s when painting was going through one of its periodic revivals, Milroy has continued to produce work of rare painterly charisma with a highly distinctive and personal range of subject matter. Early works tended to focus on shoes, stamps, door handles and lightbulbs, laid out in grids of deceptive compositional predictability on a blank off-white background. The later work on show expands its perspective to include gardens, buildings and geishas, but retains its air of semi-surreal monochrome wonderment. Gallery North, Tue to 4 Apr Robert Clark Shilpa Gupta, Bristol Global boundaries, divisions and a culture of control are brought lyrically to light in Shilpa Gupta's work. Cages, steel security grills and iron gates rank among the forms her installations have taken in the past few years, though the prisons she refers to are of the psychological kind: fear and paranoia as social regulators. Her Singing Cloud is a hanging mass of bulbous black microphones, like a frozen storm cloud or a floating sea monster with a lumpy, bumpy hide. The mics have been reverse-wired to double as speakers from which a soundtrack of whispering voices and aeroplane engines pours. It complements her departure lounge flap board, where lines like \"two twins are at war\", create a fractured poem of terrorism, conflict and loss. Arnolfini, to 22 Apr SS Edward Burra, Nottingham For far too long Edward Burra has been dismissed as a eccentric minor talent, an interesting oddity working alone outside the mainstream trends of 20th-century modernism. But now that narrative is all acceptable again in the artworld, this timely exhibition should surely lead to a reassessment. Working in watercolour, Burra would find inspiration among the sailors and prostitutes of the southern ports of France and walk the cool jazz-era streets of 1930s Harlem. Back home in Rye he would build up images of a remarkable compositional vigour and aesthetic vibrancy that perfectly reflected his wild life adventures. Djanogly Art Gallery, to 27 May RC Alex Hubbard, London Things are always on the move in the New York-based artist Alex Hubbard's work. A few years ago his videos recalled Jackson Pollock: shot from above, Hubbard's own pours of paint on Plexiglas became wipe-away colour field creations while household objects were hastily arranged, smashed and given spraypaint coatings. A more recent work involved rigging up a blank canvas behind a car, whiting out the vehicle's windows and wheels with paint and then driving the whole thing down the street. For his new paintings he uses finds from his studio and the street on canvas and stills daubed with glow-in-the-dark resin. Hubbard reflects a state of constant transformation, destruction and renewal. Simon Lee Gallery, W1, to 5 Apr SS Topophobia, Liverpool While the history of landscape art has been predominantly concerned with how sites of interest might look, the multimedia artworks here evoke an anxiety triggered by how a particular location might make one feel. Indeed the word topophobia refers to an irrational dread of certain places or situations. Marja Helander, a member of the nomadic S\u00e1mi peoples of Scandinavia, photographs herself dressed in full traditional garb as she selects her weekly groceries from a supermarket shelf. Elsewhere, in less tangible media, Louise K Wilson uses hi-tech recording equipment to foreground sounds of sites that might have accrued an unsettling ambience, military test sites or locations of mysterious disappearances. It's art that is almost not there but what is there takes us somewhere else indeed. The Bluecoat, to 22 Apr RC Alice Channer, London Channer's clothing-inspired sculptures aren't afraid to get up close and personal with consumer culture. Referencing fashion designs and throwaway high-street fare alike, she focuses on the products that literally touch our bodies. Here, she collides the current with literal classics, the hand-carved with the machined. Stretchy Top Shop items, the flowing, folding drapery of classical statues and Yves Saint Laurent's Le Smoking suit have variously inspired giant digital prints that fall cape-like from the ceiling, conflations of cast aluminium with spandex or polished marble and sheets of stainless steel shimmering like satin. South London Gallery, SE5, to 13 May SS On Kawara, Gateshead On Kawara makes art that marks time. His Today Series paintings, begun in 1966, consist of each day's date painted in black on a plain white background. The poignancy of other works relies on a demonstration of the past expanding as the future shrinks. Central to this exhibition is One Million Years, a live performance for which two participants will sit in a windowed booth and recite dates from two books titled Past and Future. Past covers the years 998,031 BC to 1969 and Future begins for some reason with the year 1993 and extends through to 1,001,992 AD, all of which will take the two month run of the show to complete.

He started by making music for Japanese rhythm action games in high school and now he's one of the best producers in France. The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Daft Punk: Da Funk I've played it so much that I usually only use it as a last resort but it never disappoints. The track that currently gets the most rewinds Surkin: Lose Yourself (Rustie Remix) It's always strange when you hear a remix of one of your tracks for the first time but I loved this one instantly. We share a common love for digital synths and 90s influences but apply them in very different ways. The track I wish I'd signed to my label Randomer: Real Talk A super-classy re-interpretation of Chicago ghetto house music, sounding rough but not retro. A perfect balance between old and new. I'm jealous! The track that got me out of bed this morning Busta Rhymes: Light Your Ass On Fire The Neptunes are the producers who introduced me to electronic sounds. This could be released tomorrow and it would still sound impressively fresh and new. The best track by my favourite new artist Light Year: Moderation They used to be a duo until they split a few months ago. Now it's only one person, and this is his first solo release. Very cool. The ideal festival track Gesaffelstein: Viol (Brodinski Remix) The original is already huge but Brodinski takes it to the next level. It's definitely going to save my life more than once this summer. The track I'd play at my auntie's wedding Phil Collins: In The Air Tonight Maybe a bit too sexual for my auntie's wedding, but I would definitely take the chance. The track that should have been a crossover hit Birdy Nam Nam ft Teki Latex: Cadillac Dreams Birdy Nam Nam are huge in France but for some reason their music has never really taken off abroad. Cadillac Dreams sounds like a robotic Notorious BIG came back to life to make screwed-up music. The track I'd play at sunset in Ibiza Joe Smooth: Promised Land I was only four when this was released but in 20 years nobody has managed to do anything more \"sunsetty\" than this track.

He started by making music for Japanese rhythm action games in high school and now he's one of the best producers in France.</p> <h2><strong>The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ZqN_VFhdo\" title=\"\"><strong>Daft Punk: Da Funk</strong></a></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>I've played it so much that I usually only use it as a last resort but it never disappoints.</p> <h2><strong>The track that currently gets the most rewinds </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqUxYb-hQQA\" title=\"\"><strong>Surkin: Lose Yourself (Rustie Remix)</strong></a> </h2> <p>It's always strange when you hear a remix of one of your tracks for the first time but I loved this one instantly. We share a common love for digital synths and 90s influences but apply them in very different ways.</p> <h2><strong>The track I wish I'd signed to my label</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYVlV5Tw5to\" title=\"\"><strong>Randomer: Real Talk</strong></a></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A super-classy re-interpretation of Chicago ghetto house music, sounding rough but not retro. A perfect balance between old and new. I'm jealous!</p> <h2><strong>The track that got me out of bed this morning</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwqX1t0CSQ\" title=\"\"><strong>Busta Rhymes: Light Your Ass On Fire</strong></a></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The Neptunes are the producers who introduced me to electronic sounds. This could be released tomorrow and it would still sound impressively fresh and new.</p> <h2><strong>The best track by my favourite new artist</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1f1M_MUEfQ\" title=\"\"><strong>Light Year: Moderation</strong></a></h2> <p>They used to be a duo until they split a few months ago. Now it's only one person, and this is his first solo release. Very cool.</p> <h2><strong>The ideal festival track</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqWE_L96WYo\" title=\"\"><strong>Gesaffelstein: Viol (Brodinski Remix)</strong></a></h2> <p>The original is already huge but Brodinski takes it to the next level. It's definitely going to save my life more than once this summer.</p> <h2><strong>The track I'd play at my auntie's wedding </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkADj0TPrJA&amp;ob=av2e\" title=\"\"><strong>Phil Collins: In The Air Tonight</strong></a></h2> <p>Maybe a bit too sexual for my auntie's wedding, but I would definitely take the chance.</p> <h2><strong>The track that should have been a crossover hit</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlOgsM0BGjk\" title=\"\"><strong>Birdy Nam Nam ft Teki Latex: Cadillac Dreams</strong></a></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Birdy Nam Nam are huge in France but for some reason their music has never really taken off abroad. Cadillac Dreams sounds like a robotic Notorious BIG came back to life to make screwed-up music.</p> <h2><strong>The track I'd play at sunset in Ibiza </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML3w4HIMHpY\" title=\"\"><strong>Joe Smooth: Promised Land</strong></a></h2> <p>I was only four when this was released but in 20 years nobody has managed to do anything more \"sunsetty\" than this track.</p> <p><strong><em>Surkin plays The Nest, N16, Friday</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "What to wear for a day in \"the best club in London\"? I bought nude tights, which to me represent the end of days, as I was off to the House of Lords. I have been before, but I know little about the Lords. On my last visit, an attendant told me off on the blue carpet (carpets are a big deal there \u2013 green for the Commons, red for the Lords). Blue, apparently, meant I could \"ponder but not talk\". Many years ago, some old codger took me to a bar there and got \"vair vair drunk\". More recently, I ran for a train, got on and found myself sitting opposite Thomas Galloway Dunlop du Roy de Blicquy Galbraith, 2nd Baron Strathclyde, leader of the House of Lords. He was with some posho mate, and I was struggling to take off my coat. \"Let me help you. I am fantastically good at undressing women,\" said the mate while Strathclyde chortled. That old hereditary charm is lost on me, so I spent the rest of the journey hot and flustered in my coat, semaphoring to other people on the train that I was nothing to do with these very loud, braying men. But however ridiculous the idea of a house of senile aristos seems, it has become apparent that almost anyone can now become a peer through the appointment system \u2013 John Prescott, Alan Sugar, Oona King. Surely not everyone there is just a feckless scrounger or an inbred toff? Indeed, lately, as the Lords keep throwing back major bills on healthcare, welfare reform and legal aid, many look to the second chamber as an increasingly vital focus of opposition. Certainly many lobbyists do. During the debate on disability living allowance, the Lords looked not so much like the nation's revising house as its conscience. Lord Patel, a former obstetrician and son of Indian immigrants, spoke with huge authority. \"I am sympathetic to cutting the deficit, but I am highly sympathetic to sick and vulnerable people not being subject to something that will make their lives more miserable.\" Who said you need bishops to make a case for compassion, or even basic morality? So here I am once more in the grand but fusty institution, being hurried along book\u2013lined corridors and \u2013 again \u2013 being told off for having my phone on. Groups of school children, too, are being shown the royal gallery, the robing rooms where the Queen gets kitted up and there is, I am told, a secret loo. The Pugin pomp is impressive; he was not bad as interior designers go, though all royal bling looks sub-My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding now. Hogwarts is the word everyone uses and certainly, if you were so inclined, it is full of ghosts. I am being shown round by Steve Bassam, aka Lord Bassam of Brighton, who is telling me how being ennobled felt like a cross between a Masonic ritual and marriage vows, when he gets called away. It's a big day in the Lords, with lots of amendments on the healthcare bill to be voted through, and Lords reform is on the agenda \u2013 again. Some, rather over-excitedly, think this is the issue that will split the coalition. I wouldn't hold your breath. I pop to the loo. There is a walking frame in the cubicle, so I go to the next one and realise there's one in every cubicle. The titles are confusing. Several barons tell me there are \"five grades of peer\", but no one puts them in the right order \u2013 duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron. Baroness (Jan) Royall of Blaisdon, leader of the opposition in the Lords, explains that her husband doesn't get a title. But wives do. Jan's office is not that grand. I don't know what I was expecting. Chandeliers? I ask her if everyone is ancient and just basically Awol. It turns out the median age is 68, and it isn't a something-for-nothing-culture. They only get their \u00a3300 daily allowance if they turn up. About half of them do, especially for votes. A couple of hundred never do, but there is no way of firing them. The people I meet stress the cost-efficiency of the place. Jan says many of the elderly peers are razor-sharp, and I have seen Joel Barnett wandering about \u2013 he must be 90-something \u2013 yet it was he who invented the Barnett formula. What I am beginning to understand is that it is the 200 or so cross-benchers who change the complexion of the place. Argument and debate matter if you want to get people on side. The role of the whips here is somewhat different from the Commons, which makes for a very different atmosphere. For any reform, the sticking point is the 92 remaining \"hereditaries\", but there is no dismissing the real-life experience in the house, even though Nick Clegg did when he described it as \"a veneer of expertise\". Indeed, when Melvyn Bragg takes me for tea in the dining room, he laughs about people speaking \"a lot of jelly\", but then points at Robert Winston, resplendent in green corduroy. \"I was here the day he got up and said, 'You are all talking about stem cell research. I have been doing that this morning in my lab. Let me tell you about where it will lead.'\" \"That,\" says Bragg, \"was electrifying. Now we have medics, arts and culture people, like [David] Puttnam, academics, ex-civil servants \u2026 \" Alongside this, though, is a load of archaic nonsense. Bragg is not keen on the bishops, although many people speak well of them. I collar Tim Stevens, Bishop of Leicester, who seems a little nervy, but perhaps that's because he is about to go into the joint committee on the draft House of Lords reform bill. Bishop Tim thinks that other faiths should be represented, which raises the inevitable \"who will represent the Jedis?\" question. As I chat to him, he reminds me that he is Convener of the Lords Spiritual, which is a sort of chief bishop. I am about to ask him how he got that gig, when Clegg appears and is surrounded by people who want to talk to him. I am mystified, but then someone reminds me he is deputy prime minister, after all. Baroness Bakewell of Stockport in the County of Greater Manchester, or Joan, as I presume to call her later, tells me: \"I said to a bishop, 'Actually, that's a post I will never be eligible for.'\" She has also complained about prayers. If you want a seat in the chamber, you have to get in for prayers, so \"we godless huddle outside\". She doesn't like the psalms, either. \"I asked, 'Can't we have some pious poetry? Milton, or something, instead?'\" Bakewell is, of course, instantly recognisable, as are the celeb peers, such as Andrew Lloyd Webber and Ruth Rendell. What is most odd is seeing Spitting Image come to life again, for all the old Thatcherites are there. Lamont, Tebbit, Lawson \u2013 some of whom are now voting against this government. Lunch is, disappointingly, a tuna sandwich in a canteen. No gold plates or anything. But Labour peer Lord Bach is keen to explain how we must stop the decimation of legal aid. His researcher, Imran Ahmed, is another \"convert\" to the Lords having been in the Commons. Are these people really telling me that an undemocratic house is protecting civil liberties and reflecting the mindset of ordinary people more than the Commons? Well, certainly they feel they must ameliorate the forthcoming bills on health, welfare reform and legal aid \"that would bring huge changes to society\". After watching the opening procession of men in tights stamping around with a mace, I go to the actual chamber with my mind full of the radical potential I have heard about. Then comes the first question: \"Lord Spicer to ask Her Majesty's government what consideration they have given to allowing traffic to turn left at a red traffic light in the way that certain authorities in the United States permit vehicles to turn right.\" The ensuing discussion sends me into a trance, but it's all very polite, no boo-yah Commons stuff, and no Speaker to shut them up. I wake up to hear Strathclyde booming on about \"ping-pong during dinner break\". I find out later this is not table tennis, but bills bouncing between the two houses. Floella Benjamin, Baroness of Playschool, says something about films for children, and then we're on to the important amendments on the healthcare bill. What sounds like a broken alarm clock goes off to call a vote. They all creep out of their warrens and file in, and I manage to find Baroness Shirley Williams. \"This place swallows legislation like other people swallow martinis,\" she tells me. I want to buy Shirley a martini but, at 81, she is indefatigable, and has work to do. She is not so keen on Lords reform (which was in all three parties' manifestos). \"I'm cynical, having seen three attempts in 15 years.\" Most are for reform, but are unsure how it will work. Will a second elected chamber be in opposition to the Commons? \"How does the Commons retain its primacy?\" asks Bragg. One of the problems, he says, is that there is simply too much legislation. He would like a bill stopping more legislation, \"but that's a bit Alice in Wonderland\". Many joke about the barmy old hereditaries with their egg sandwiches, and I keep asking if there is as much drinking in the Lords as in what they call \"the other place\". No one really answers, but everyone talks of cross-party friendships and wonder what reform could reproduce this hodge-podge of people. Why would many of the more effective Lords even stand for election? Who exactly would they be representing? Class is not an issue for many, but real-world skills are. Indeed, class was only mentioned by Baroness [Glenys] Thornton. I kept asking people if they used their title to get upgraded, as I'd want a crown or something. \"I am from a working-class communist background,\" she says. \"Yorkshire people don't get above themselves.\" At 45 (when she was made a peer) the problem of what to do when she grew up had been solved. Since joining the Lords, she said, \"I've become more of a class warrior.\" She giggles. She is another one not happy with bishops. \"What other parliament has clerics in it?\" she asks. \"Er \u2026 Iran.\" Exactly! Baroness Hussein-Ece (Lib Dem), one of the few Turkish-Cypriot women in politics, takes me for dinner. I know her, as she was my councillor. She explains how weird it is sometimes to find herself supported by some Tory grandee, especially if she's just asked a question on female genital mutilation. Unholy alliances are the essence of the place. But as Lord Bach told me, \"They can't talk about sex. It's like watching your grandparents talk about sex.\" By now I have been in the Lords for 10 hours, and I want a drink. We go to what looks like a poor version of a Travelodge bar. Steve Bassam, who, like many a modern peer, is on Twitter, said the votes would go on until 11.15pm. A deal had been done. It all felt intensely political, but intensely polite. My head has always said abolish it all tomorrow, but by the end of the day, my heart was saying we must find a way to preserve what I had not expected to see here, in this anachronistic, rule-bound house of privilege: a passionate ethos of public service, some impressive people who think long-term, not just in electoral cycles, and a coalition in political flux. Who knows if this is possible, I wondered, as I saw Shirley Williams putting on her coat and Glenys Thornton changing into her trainers. It was near midnight. \"We've got a big week next week,\" called the Baroness, excitedly, as she rushed off to the tube. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2012. The original said that unlike the Commons there is no whip [in the Lords]. This has been clarified, as there are indeed whips in the House of Lords.",

      "body": "<p>What to wear for&#xa0;a day in \"the best club in London\"? I&#xa0;bought nude tights, which to&#xa0;me represent the end of days, as I was off to the House&#xa0;of Lords.</p> <p>I have been before, but I know little about the Lords. On my last visit, an attendant told me off on the blue carpet (carpets are a big deal there \u2013 green for the Commons, red for the Lords). Blue, apparently, meant I could \"ponder but&#xa0;not talk\".</p> <p>Many years ago, some old codger took&#xa0;me to a bar there and got \"vair vair&#xa0;drunk\". More recently, I ran for a train, got on and found myself sitting opposite <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/peer/lord_strathclyde\" title=\"\">Thomas Galloway Dunlop du Roy de Blicquy Galbraith, 2nd Baron Strathclyde</a>, leader of the House of Lords. He was with some posho mate, and I was struggling to take off my coat. \"Let me help you. I am fantastically good at undressing women,\" said the mate while Strathclyde chortled.</p> <p>That old hereditary charm is lost on&#xa0;me, so I spent the rest of the journey&#xa0;hot and flustered in my coat, semaphoring to other people on the train that I was nothing to do with these&#xa0;very loud, braying men. But however ridiculous the idea of a house&#xa0;of senile aristos seems, it has become apparent that almost anyone can now become a peer through the appointment system \u2013 John Prescott, Alan Sugar, Oona King. Surely not everyone there is just a feckless scrounger or an inbred toff? Indeed, lately, as the Lords keep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jan/11/lords-welfare-bill-defeat-for-government\" title=\"\">throwing back major bills</a> on healthcare, welfare reform and legal aid, many look to the second chamber as an increasingly vital focus of&#xa0;opposition. Certainly many lobbyists do. During the debate on disability living allowance, the Lords looked not&#xa0;so much like the nation's revising house as its conscience. Lord Patel, a former obstetrician and son of Indian immigrants, spoke with huge authority. \"I am sympathetic to cutting the deficit, but I am highly sympathetic to sick and vulnerable people not being subject to something that will make their lives more miserable.\" Who said you need bishops to make a case for compassion, or even basic morality?</p> <p>So here I am once more in the grand but fusty institution, being hurried along book\u2013lined corridors and \u2013 again \u2013 being told off for having my phone on. Groups of school children, too, are being shown the royal gallery, the robing rooms where the Queen gets kitted up and there is, I am told, a secret loo. The Pugin pomp is impressive; he was not bad as interior designers go, though all royal bling looks sub-My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding now. Hogwarts is the word everyone uses and certainly, if you were&#xa0;so inclined, it is full of ghosts.</p> <p>I am being shown round by Steve Bassam, aka <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/john-bassam/26880\" title=\"\">Lord Bassam of Brighton</a>, who is telling me how being ennobled felt like a&#xa0;cross between a Masonic ritual and marriage vows, when he gets called away. It's a big day in the Lords, with lots of amendments on the healthcare bill to be voted through, and Lords reform is on the agenda \u2013 again. Some, rather over-excitedly, think this is the issue that will split the coalition. I&#xa0;wouldn't hold your breath. I pop to&#xa0;the&#xa0;loo. There is a walking frame in the cubicle, so I go to the next one and realise there's one in every cubicle.</p> <p>The titles are confusing. Several barons tell me there are \"five grades of peer\", but no one puts them in the right order \u2013 duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron. <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/32312\" title=\"\">Baroness (Jan) Royall of Blaisdon</a>, leader of the opposition in the&#xa0;Lords, explains that her husband doesn't get a title. But wives do. Jan's office is not that grand. I don't know what I was expecting. Chandeliers? I ask&#xa0;her if everyone is ancient and just basically Awol. It turns out the median age is 68, and it isn't a something-for-nothing-culture. They only get their \u00a3300 daily allowance if they turn up. About half of them do, especially for votes. A couple of hundred never do, but there is no way of firing them.</p> <p>The people I meet stress the cost-efficiency of the place. Jan says many of the elderly peers are razor-sharp, and I have seen Joel Barnett wandering about \u2013 he must be 90-something \u2013 yet it was he who invented the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_formula\" title=\"\">Barnett formula</a>. What I am beginning to understand is that it is the 200 or so cross-benchers who change the complexion of the place. Argument and debate matter if you want to get people on side. The role of the whips here is somewhat different from the Commons, which makes for a&#xa0;very different atmosphere. For any reform, the sticking point is the 92 remaining \"hereditaries\", but there is no&#xa0;dismissing the real-life experience in&#xa0;the house, even though Nick Clegg did when he described it as \"a veneer of&#xa0;expertise\".</p> <p>Indeed, when Melvyn Bragg takes me&#xa0;for tea in the dining room, he laughs about people speaking \"a lot of jelly\", but then points at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/robertwinston\" title=\"\">Robert Winston</a>, resplendent in green corduroy. \"I was here the day he got up and said, 'You are&#xa0;all talking about stem cell research. I&#xa0;have been doing that this morning in my lab. Let me tell you about where it will lead.'\"</p> <p>\"That,\" says Bragg, \"was electrifying. Now we have medics, arts and culture people, like [David] Puttnam, academics, ex-civil servants \u2026 \" Alongside this, though, is a load of archaic nonsense. Bragg is not keen on the bishops, although many people speak well of them. I collar <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/timothy-stevens/26825\" title=\"\">Tim Stevens, Bishop of Leicester</a>, who seems a little nervy, but perhaps that's because he is about to go into the joint committee on the draft House of Lords reform bill. Bishop Tim thinks that other faiths should be represented, which raises the&#xa0;inevitable \"who will represent the Jedis?\" question. As I chat to him, he reminds me that he is Convener of the Lords Spiritual, which is a sort of chief bishop. I am about to ask him how he got that gig, when Clegg appears and is surrounded by people who want to talk to him. I am mystified, but then someone reminds me he is deputy prime minister, after all.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/joan-bakewell/90430\" title=\"\">Baroness Bakewell</a> of Stockport in the&#xa0;County of Greater Manchester, or Joan, as I presume to call her later, tells me: \"I said to a bishop, 'Actually, that's a&#xa0;post I will never be eligible for.'\" She has also complained about prayers.

      "bodyText": "The Mark Lanegan Band, On tour A slightly scary man in person, what with the not smiling, the tattooed hands, and the being about six foot seven, Mark Lanegan is, professionally-speaking, a people person. An eager collaborator, Lanegan is an in-demand guest, the Snoop Dogg of the post-grunge American rock world. All this work (with Isobel Campbell, Greg Dulli, Soulsavers and as a member of Queens Of The Stone Age), hasn't left the Screaming Trees singer much time left to his own devices, which makes his new Blues Funeral album a doubly pleasurable thing to hear. It's hallmarked with Lanegan's doomy portend but also finds room for subtle texture, belting rockers, and even a heartfelt take on disco. O2 Academy Bristol, Sun; Manchester Academy, Mon; Academy, Dublin, Wed; QUBSU, Belfast, Thu; O2 ABC, Glasgow, Fri John Robinson Florence + The Machine, On tour Florence Welch has always had a huge voice, and, with her new album, Ceremonials, she now has a sound that's just as large. On occasion, the shiny and endlessly reverberating palace she and producer Paul Epworth have built up can seem a bit T'Pau. Really, though, it's a case of \"if you build it, they will come\". Which is to say, if you make an album so preposterously large-sounding that it becomes impossible to ignore, then surely people will be sucked in, as if by the planetary gravity of such a massive entity. All of which might be a bit much had Florence not created a mildly eccentric, all-over-the-place-emotionally public persona and pulled off coups (like her Dizzee Rascal collaboration) that have preserved much of her initial charm. Bournemouth International Centre, Sun; Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff, Mon; Capital FM Arena, Nottingham, Tue; Alexandra Palace, N22, Thu to 10 Mar JR Earth, On tour Earth's story is about the calm after the storm. A Seattle band in the grunge era, Earth's music was light years away from the cathartic rock songs of their peers, with long drones of feedbacking, downtuned guitars forming the instrumental equivalent of a poker face. Over the subsequent 20 years, however, the band have admitted more space into their music, with melodies taking on greater importance. These days founder Dylan Carlson investigates ghostly forms, presences, fairies etc, and Earth's records, in turn, have taken on something of this searching and suggestive, rather than downright oppressive, quality. Arnolfini, Bristol, Sat; Button Factory, Dublin, Mon; Ruby Lounge, Manchester, Wed; The Caves, Edinburgh, Thu; Brudenell Social Club, Leeds, Fri JR Damon Brown's Ugetsu, On tour Trumpeter Damon Brown is a virtuoso player who knows where the music came from and how it works \u2013 but though he often celebrates the hard-bop and soul-steeped styles of the 1960s, he's much too forceful an artist to ever be an anorak. The Briton's gleaming sound, poised attack, and deft rhythmic sense are ideally complemented by Tokyo pianist Yutaka Shiina, who's played in Elvin Jones's Jazz Machine. Ugetsu is co-led by Brown and German bassist Martin Zenker, with Christian Brewer on saxes, and Andreas Bauer on drums. The Hideaway, SW16, Sat; Jagz, Ascot, Sun (1pm); Campus West, Welwyn Garden City, Sun; Colston Hall, Bristol, Tue; D'Fly, Cheltenham, Wed; Watermill Jazz, Dorking, Thu; Wakefield Jazz, Fri John Fordham St Matthew Passion, On tour No church choir has more claim to authenticity in performing JS Bach than the Thomaskirche in Leipzig. Bach was its cantor (choirmaster and organist) for the last 23 years of his life, and it was there that he composed most of his cantatas, as well as both the St Matthew and St John Passions. Two years ago the choir came with Leipzig's Gewandhaus for the St Matthew Passion at London's Barbican, conducted by Riccardo Chailly. On this visit the choir's current cantor, Georg Christoph Biller, is in charge, only the 14th person to hold that post since Bach himself. Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Thu; Symphony Hall, Birmingham, Fri Andrew Clements Surrogate Cities, London Sixty this year, Heiner Goebbels is perhaps the least categorisable of leading European composers. He works with actors as regularly as he writes for musicians, and his compositions consistently blur the distinctions between drama, music theatre, opera and instrumental music. Almost all his works in the last 15 years have a visual dimension, and invariably carry with them a whole network of literary, political and cultural connections. Today, members of the National Youth Orchestra join forces with students from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire for one of the few Goebbels pieces that does belong in the conventional concert hall. Surrogate Cities is an attempt to translate the dynamics and the architecture of a city into music. It uses a variety of texts as well as sampled sounds to create its portrait, alongside music that ranges right across the spectrum of popular and classical styles. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Sat AC",

An eager collaborator, Lanegan is an in-demand guest, the Snoop Dogg of the post-grunge American rock world. All this work (with Isobel Campbell, Greg Dulli, Soulsavers and as a member of Queens Of The Stone Age), hasn't left the Screaming Trees singer much time left to his own devices, which makes his new Blues Funeral album a doubly pleasurable thing to hear. It's hallmarked with Lanegan's doomy portend but also finds room for subtle texture, belting rockers, and even a heartfelt take on disco.</p> <p><strong><em>O2 Academy Bristol, Sun; Manchester Academy, Mon; Academy, Dublin, Wed; QUBSU, Belfast, Thu; O2 ABC, Glasgow, Fri</em></strong></p> <p><em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Florence + The Machine, On tour</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386724656\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/1/1330599711727/Florence-Welch-004.jpg\" alt=\"Florence Welch\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florence Welch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Florence Welch has always had a huge voice, and, with her new album, Ceremonials, she now has a sound that's just as large. On occasion, the shiny and endlessly reverberating palace she and producer Paul Epworth have built up can seem a bit T'Pau. Really, though, it's a case of \"if you build it, they will come\". Which is to say, if you make an album so preposterously large-sounding that it becomes impossible to ignore, then surely people will be sucked in, as if by the planetary gravity of such a massive entity. All of which might be a bit much had Florence not created a mildly eccentric, all-over-the-place-emotionally public persona and pulled off coups (like her Dizzee Rascal collaboration) that have preserved much of her initial charm.</p> <p><strong><em>Bournemouth International Centre, Sun; Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff, Mon; Capital FM Arena, Nottingham, Tue; Alexandra Palace, N22, Thu to 10 Mar</em></strong></p> <p><em>JR</em></p> <h2>Earth, On tour</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386724657\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/1/1330599757837/Earth-004.jpg\" alt=\"Earth\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Earth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earth's story is about the calm after the storm.

Photograph: Wonge Bergmann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Sixty this year, Heiner Goebbels is perhaps the least categorisable of leading European composers. He works with actors as regularly as he writes for musicians, and his compositions consistently blur the distinctions between drama, music theatre, opera and instrumental music. Almost all his works in the last 15 years have a visual dimension, and invariably carry with them a whole network of literary, political and cultural connections. Today, members of the National Youth Orchestra join forces with students from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire for one of the few Goebbels pieces that does belong in the conventional concert hall. Surrogate Cities is an attempt to translate the dynamics and the architecture of a city into music. It uses a variety of texts as well as sampled sounds to create its portrait, alongside music that ranges right across the spectrum of popular and classical styles.</p> <p><strong><em>Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Sat </em></strong></p> <p><em>AC</em></p>",

He was Mr Practical, she was brilliant with the money. Everybody liked them. I borrowed the name Paul from my first son, who was born in 1960. I was born Newton Edward Daniels, everyone called me Ted, but Paul worked better for showbusiness. My first home, a bungalow in Mablethorpe, on the east coast, where my dad was a cinema projectionist, was blown to bits by the Luftwaffe one night. It was a lucky escape. I was a toddler. My mum stood, transfixed as she heard the whistling sound of a bomb approaching. She ran across the road with me in her arms, only just making it into our neighbour's house before the bomb exploded and flattened ours. My dad, who was at work, was greatly relieved to find us safe. Our next home was a two-up, two-down in Lower Oxford Street, in South Bank, Middlesbrough. Was it the poverty that made the community so strong? The whole neighbourhood pulled together and helped each other. Every Friday we had a bath in front of the open fire in the front room. Outside at the back of the yard was a toilet in a small brick outhouse. Going to the toilet in winter toughened you up no end. My mum was very house-proud so everything was as clean as it could be. Granny Lloyd, a few doors away from us, was the town midwife and undertaker, in that she used to lay out the bodies and get them ready for the latter. She used to say: \"I get them coming and going.\" I was the first boy from my area to get to grammar school. Where I came from, your destiny was set early on. You went to the steelworks or the docks or, if you were lucky, were articled as a clerk in a solicitors or accountants. I was an avid reader and because of that I got a scholarship to Sir William Turner's Grammar School in Redcar. It was six miles on the bus each way. My youngest brother died at six weeks of age. I was too young to know what it meant, but now I think how devastating it must have been for my parents. He was called a blue baby, as he had a heart problem. In those days, there was nothing doctors could do. He seemed to improve and we all got used to having him with us until one day my mum discovered him dead in his cot. It was a terrible blow for her and my father, but the grief seemed to pull us together. My ambition to become a magician was purely seen as a hobby. It was handy, as it meant kids at school liked me more. But I was meant to take a proper job. Show business, acting \u2013 that just wasn't proper work where I came from. When my girlfriend, Jackie, got pregnant it was a total shock. It was the late 50s, so I sat down with my parents and hers, and we agreed to get married. That is how it was in those days. It wasn't the best marriage \u2013 Jackie left me in 1962 when my first son, Paul, was 18 months old. She just left a note, saying she'd gone off with her dancing partner, someone she'd met socially. She came back a week later, and I thought that my son needed a mother so we made another go of it. We stayed together, had two more sons, Martin and Gary, whom I love and cherish, but eventually parted company. I've been married to Debbie for 33 years. I was so lucky to meet her. I don't understand people who say they hate their mother or their father. You should find a way of loving your kin. My mum is still alive and going strong at 96, running her own house and I think the world of her. She lives only half an hour away. My three sons are scattered across the country \u2013 in Wigan, Cheltenham, Doncaster \u2013 but we all keep in touch and I'll do anything for my family. Debbie and I are both like that.

It's not always easy for a single person to look through a lens in a studio and engage with a child at home but I just really enjoy what I do and I hope that comes across in my performance. I genuinely love it.\" In the space of an hour, Justin Fletcher, 41, whose colourful roll call of characters includes Anna Conda, Arthur Sleep, Gail Force and, of course, the inimitable Mr Tumble, uses the phrase, \"I love it,\" more than the average four-year-old whines, \"I want ...\" before breakfast. He radiates enthusiasm for his genre and not in the often manufactured manner of scores of younger presenters who have at least one eye on their next \"adult\" presenting gig. \"I've been doing this for 16 years,\" he says. \"This is not a stepping stone to other things and daytime telly. I've always loved performing and I knew in my first year at drama college that I wanted to do children's television.\" As one of five children of the celebrated songwriter Guy Fletcher, who wrote hits for Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Ray Charles and Cliff Richard, and now chairs the Performing Rights Society, Justin was born into performing at the family home in Berkshire. \"I was brought up in that kind of creative world and I got to meet some very interesting people,\" he says. \"Dad wrote Cliff Richard's 1973 Eurovision Song Contest entry, Power To All Our Friends, and Cliff came over a few times. I was only three then but my big sister Juliet was madly in love with him and used to hug him and not let him go. \"Rick Wakeman was a regular visitor and Ron Goodwin who scored the movie Where Eagles Dare and Les Reed, who wrote Tom Jones's It's Not Unusual, would use the studio in the house. I was fascinated by all that.\" Despite piano lessons as a boy, Justin's creativity veered away from music. \"From as early as I can remember I was much more into creating characters,\" says Justin, who plays 26 different ones in his sketch series, Gigglebiz. \"I used to write little characters down and observe people. Particularly schoolteachers. I was quite good at mimicking people. But what really started it off was my dad giving me his Super 8 cine camera. That was it for me. I was out there making my own films. I'd save all my pocket money to buy Kodak Super 8 film, which you then had to send off to the lab \u2013 it took a week to get it back \u2026 the excitement ... it was too much.\" Justin's childhood TV heroes will be familiar names to anyone brought up on 70s TV. \"I was a huge Muppets fan but the real gods were Derek Griffiths and the guvnor, Brian Cant.\" Mere mention of Cant, whose effortless affability and gentle humour endeared him to millions, provokes an almost reverential response. \"Brian Cant has got a huge amount to do with what I do now. He's the man. A brilliant performer. I used to watch these guys and observe them very carefully because they were so good. So engaging.\" A keen student of visual comedy, Justin's inspirations date back long before the 1970s. \"I used to wear out VHS tapes of Laurel and Hardy and study those little looks to camera. I incorporate that as a little homage to those guys. And obviously, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, too.Those silent stars were fantastic for using facial expression.\" CBeebies celebrates its 10th anniversary as a stand-alone digital channel this year and Justin has been at its heart from day one. Early success in slapstick showcases Tikabilla and Higgledy House, plus voice roles in Tweenies, Finley the Fire Engine, Shaun the Sheep and Thomas the Tank Engine (Justin's ring tone is a \"choo choo\" train noise) led to comedy vehicles Gigglebiz, Jollywobbles and, most recently, the Crackerjack-style Justin's House. But the show that has earned him two Baftas and an MBE is the pioneering Something Special, featuring Mr Tumble and using the Makaton signing system, to help relieve the frustration of children with speech difficulties. \"It's such an important show,\" says Justin. \"We get letters daily saying, 'My child has spoken for the first time after watching that programme.' \"And children of seven or eight who struggle talking can engage with that programme \u2013 it really helps them. I'll be doing the CBeebies live tour during the Easter holidays, but after that we're filming the eighth series of Something Special and we have to keep it going.\" That is great news for Mr Tumble fans. More surprising news, perhaps, is the revelation that the playful red-nosed joker who brings Justin so much attention \u2013 \"One of the Queen's guards even shouted out 'Mr Tumble' before I met her,\" \u2013 was partially inspired by the smutty 1980s DJ and sketch-show king, Kenny Everett. \"Mr Tumble was an amalgamation of an idea the commissioning editor had for a character who signed and an old character I'd been touring schools with, called Professor Muddles. We shot the first pilot show against a plain white studio background and that simplicity reminded me of the Kenny Everett sketches. Nothing was cluttering the screen and kids can engage easily with that. \"I loved Kenny Everett. I thought his sketches were fantastic. My dad used to write music for them and even appeared in the background as a pianist in a few. Those sketches worked because they were clear and simple, and it's the same with Mr Tumble.\" Such is the popularity of Mr Tumble that Justin is planning a feature-length movie version, hopefully including cameo performances from some of his celebrity admirers, among them Gary Barlow, Simon Pegg, Peter Kay and Johnny Depp. \"I've stayed in touch with Gary Barlow, since we met at the Baftas, and I've had supportive emails from Simon Pegg and Peter Kay, both of whom I love, and I've been told that Johnny Depp brought his kids to a show I did in Bath, so it would be great to get them all involved. I've got a nice idea about Mr Tumble going through a regular day and coming across hundreds of children, like a kind of Pied Piper character, and I think it could work internationally, too, as there's minimal dialogue so there's no language barrier. Mr Bean is huge in places like Asia \u2013 and look at the success of The Artist.\" Should a silver-screen Mr Tumble bring Justin global recognition, one thing you are unlikely to see is the star of the show falling out of a nightclub at 3am. \"I've gone through that whole stage of going out quite a bit and I just like to spend time quietly with my friends and family who all live in and around Berkshire,\" says Justin, who is single, and has no children of his own, but is a popular uncle to his four siblings' children. \"It can sometimes be difficult to switch off with so many different characters swimming round in my head but when I get home I just like going out to sort out the fish in the pond in my garden. I'm just a regular guy. \"Getting up early and being sparky in front of a camera at 8.30 in the morning isn't a problem for me. I'm conditioned to do it and really love it. \"I'm doing what I really want to do. I'm really blessed by the amount I've already done and you can't beat watching a child's face light up when you're doing a character or a song. While I've still got the energy and the ideas I'm going to keep going \u2013 I just love it.\" CBeebies Live! tours the UK from 31 March to 14 April. Justin's new album Hands Up is released on Monday",

Particularly schoolteachers. I was quite good at mimicking people. But what really started it off was my dad giving me his Super 8 cine camera. That was it for me. I was out there making my own films. I'd save all my pocket money to buy Kodak Super 8 film, which you then had to send off to the lab \u2013 it took a week to get it back \u2026 the excitement ... it was too much.\"</p> <p>Justin's childhood TV heroes will be familiar names to anyone brought up on 70s TV. \"I was a huge Muppets fan but the real gods were Derek Griffiths and the guvnor, Brian Cant.\"</p> <p>Mere mention of Cant, whose effortless affability and gentle humour endeared him to millions, provokes an almost reverential response. \"Brian Cant has got a huge amount to do with what I do now. He's the man. A brilliant performer. I used to watch these guys and observe them very carefully because they were so good. So engaging.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386693355\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/2/28/1330429093023/Mr-Tumble-aka-Justin-Flet-007.jpg\" alt=\"Mr Tumble, aka Justin Fletcher\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'You can't fool kids': Justin Fletcher as Mr Tumble. Photograph: BBC/Simon Duncan/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A keen student of visual comedy, Justin's inspirations date back long before the 1970s. \"I used to wear out VHS tapes of Laurel and Hardy and study those little looks to camera. I incorporate that as a little homage to those guys. And obviously, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, too.Those silent stars were fantastic for using facial expression.\"</p> <p>CBeebies celebrates its 10th anniversary as a stand-alone digital channel this year and Justin has been at its heart from day one.</p> <p>Early success in slapstick showcases Tikabilla and Higgledy House, plus voice roles in Tweenies, Finley the Fire Engine, Shaun the Sheep and Thomas the Tank Engine (Justin's ring tone is a \"choo choo\" train noise) led to comedy vehicles Gigglebiz, Jollywobbles and, most recently, the Crackerjack-style Justin's&#xa0;House.</p> <p>But the show that has earned him two Baftas and an MBE is the pioneering Something Special, featuring Mr Tumble and using the Makaton signing system, to help relieve the frustration of children with speech difficulties.</p> <p>\"It's such an important show,\" says Justin. \"We get letters daily saying, 'My child has spoken for the first time after watching that programme.'</p> <p>\"And children of seven or eight who struggle talking can engage with that programme \u2013 it really helps them. I'll be doing the CBeebies live tour during the Easter holidays, but after that we're filming the eighth series of Something Special and we have to keep it going.\"</p> <p>That is great news for Mr Tumble fans. More surprising news, perhaps, is the revelation that the playful red-nosed joker who brings Justin so much attention \u2013 \"One of the Queen's guards even shouted out 'Mr Tumble' before I met her,\" \u2013 was partially inspired by the smutty 1980s DJ and sketch-show king, Kenny Everett.</p> <p>\"Mr Tumble was an amalgamation of an idea the commissioning editor had for a character who signed and an old character I'd been touring schools with, called Professor Muddles. We shot the first pilot show against a plain white studio background and that simplicity reminded me of the Kenny Everett sketches. Nothing was cluttering the screen and kids can engage easily with that.</p> <p>\"I loved Kenny Everett. I thought his sketches were fantastic. My dad used to write music for them and even appeared in the background as a pianist in a few. Those sketches worked because they were clear&#xa0;and simple, and it's the same with Mr Tumble.\"</p> <p>Such is the popularity of Mr Tumble that Justin is planning a feature-length movie version, hopefully including cameo performances from some of his celebrity admirers, among them Gary Barlow, Simon Pegg, Peter Kay and Johnny Depp.</p> <p>\"I've stayed in touch with Gary Barlow, since we met at the Baftas, and I've had supportive emails from Simon Pegg and Peter Kay, both of whom I love, and I've been told that Johnny Depp brought his kids to a show I did in Bath, so it would be great to get them all involved. I've got a nice idea about Mr Tumble going through a regular day and coming across hundreds of children, like a kind of Pied Piper character, and I think it could work internationally, too, as there's minimal dialogue so there's no language barrier. Mr Bean is huge in places like Asia \u2013 and look at the success of The Artist.\"</p> <p>Should a silver-screen Mr Tumble bring Justin global recognition, one thing you are unlikely to see is the star&#xa0;of the show falling out of a nightclub at 3am. \"I've gone through that whole stage of going out quite a bit and I just like to spend time quietly with my friends and family who all live in and around Berkshire,\" says Justin, who is single, and has no children of his own, but is a popular uncle to his four siblings' children. \"It can sometimes be difficult to switch off with so many different characters swimming round in my head but when I get home I just like going out to sort out the fish in the pond in my garden. I'm just a regular guy.</p> <p>\"Getting up early and being sparky in front of a camera at 8.30 in the morning isn't a problem for me. I'm conditioned to do it and really love it.</p> <p>\"I'm doing what I really want to do. I'm really blessed by the amount I've already done and you can't beat watching a child's face light up when you're doing a character or a song. While I've still got the energy and the ideas I'm going to keep going \u2013 I just love it.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cbeebieslive.com/\" title=\"\"><em>CBeebies Live!</em></a><em> tours the UK from 31 March to 14 April.

      "bodyText": "In 1964, the Sultan of Zanzibar sought refuge in Britain after a bloody uprising in the newly independent nation. His dramatic arrival with his family and entourage made front-page news. In one picture, a Red Cross helper was pictured wrapping a little girl in a blanket. The child was Leila Sharp. Teetering on the aeroplane steps after touching down in Manchester, the bewildered seven-year-old, who had lost all her family and was alone in a foreign land, believed she was dead. \"The ground was all glittery with frost and the airport lights shining on it. I thought, this is it \u2013 we've all died and gone to heaven,\" she says. It is one of a series of vivid early memories that have haunted Leila, 55, for most of her life. Growing up in children's homes in Kent, and told by the authorities that her parents were dead, Leila refused to believe that she was an orphan. It was not until 43 years later, when she finally dared to return to Africa to search for answers that Leila could make sense of her memories and discover the fate of her family \u2013 and why she was taken across the world with the sultan. Leila, a teaching assistant, has been married to Nick, a bus driver, for 34 years. They have four children and still live on the Kent coast, where Leila was sent to a children's home, days after arriving with Sayyid Sir Jamshid bin Abdullah Al Said, the 11th and last Sultan of Zanzibar. Her earliest memories are of life by the sea. Like the most famous escapee from Zanzibar, Freddie Mercury, Leila grew up in the cosmopolitan port of Stone Town on the Zanzibar archipelago, then a British colony. Her father and uncle were coffee sellers. \"I used to sit on the window sill waiting for my dad to come home. We lived close to the harbour and as soon as I saw him I would bolt out to meet him. Wherever he went, I would go,\" she says. \"I was always running. People would say, 'There goes Salum's daughter'\". Another early memory is of sitting on her mother's lap. \"She was crying and I was crying,\" she says. For reasons Leila did not understand, her parents were separating. In a traditional Muslim family, the men made the decisions and her mother was to be sent away; her father was to return to Yemen, his home country. Soon after that, Leila's uncle told her she was going to a party at the sultan's palace. All she knew about the sultan was that her father did not care for him, and would make a spitting motion at the mention of his name. Leila sat still to have her hair plaited; she wore a white dress and shiny red shoes. \"I skipped all the way to the palace, holding my uncle's hand,\" she says. But there was no party and Leila was left at the palace. \"When I realised my uncle wasn't coming to collect me I sat on the floor in the hallway and screamed and screamed. No one could stop me so the sultan locked me in the cupboard to calm me down,\" she says. Leila joined a small number of Muslim children who were looked after by the sultan and his household. At times she held a spitoon for the sultana, an elderly lady who had a terrible cough. The little girl would then curl up to sleep on a fluffy carpet in the sultana's room. Although only six, she rebelled in every way she could, sliding down the banisters and trying to run away. The elderly sultan became ill and went to hospital. When he returned, one of his legs had been amputated and a funeral was held for the limb. Soon afterwards, the old sultan died, and another funeral was held to reunite his body with his leg. The young sultan succeeded his father in July 1963 and had to oversee the tricky transition from British protectorate to independent nation. He also had problems closer to home. Leila remembers her father returning to get her. \"I remember him bashing the door down, yelling his head off: 'Give me my daughter! I'll kill you!' I was kicking the door from the inside while my father was drumming the door from the outside.\" Again, Leila was put in the cupboard. This time, she screamed so much that the sultan took her to the living room. \"He had a knife in his hand. He said, 'Leila, if you don't stop screaming, I'll cut your tongue out.' I called his bluff and poked my tongue out. I was such a stroppy moo. When he put the knife down I did what my father did and made a spitting motion.\" It was only when she was walked by the sultan to the barking, drooling guard dogs that Leila was frightened into stopping her screams. She had no idea why she was forbidden to see her father. That would only become clear decades later. Zanzibar celebrated its independence in December 1963, and Leila met the soldiers who accompanied the Duke of Edinburgh to the palace. She had never seen white people before and they scared her. A month later, the new country was convulsed by revolution as the African majority seized power from the Arab minority. Anyone who looked Arabic was in danger of being killed. Leila remembers a fire bell, and rounds of machine-gun fire that sounded like drums. \"Everyone was walking in the same direction and I got caught up with the flow.\" The sultan and his entourage, including Leila, fled by boat and then chartered a plane from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and flew to Britain. Unable to land in London due to thick fog, they were diverted to Manchester. The Guardian reported the Sultan's arrival at St Pancras station as \"perhaps a last moment of glory in his public career\". There also were, the report continued, \"familiar attendants of disaster \u2013 the Red Cross ladies with bundles of old clothes for 'kitting out' cold, impoverished refugees, and the Zanzibar ambassador to Egypt, who had flown to London to meet the sultan and was distributing copies of a petition he had sent to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, asking for 'immediate interference to stop the widespread massacres in Zanzibar'.\" Leila realised she was not dead \u2013 \"It's not often that people mistake Manchester for heaven,\" says Nick, her husband, smiling \u2013 and was sent to the children's home in Kent, with five other children from the sultan's household. \"There are no immediate plans for the sultan or his family to visit the group,\" noted a local paper. Leila did not realise it until much later but the sultan, who settled in Portsmouth, felt a keen obligation to care for her and tried to fulfil it. Despite being a strict Muslim, Leila was given pork to eat at the children's home and wasn't allowed to leave the table until she had finished it. \"I cried and cried into my plate. In the end, I had to eat it. That night I couldn't sleep. I thought, I've sinned and I'm going to hell. My teeth were rattling all through the night with the fear.\" Later, however, Leila converted to Christianity and when the sultan visited her as a teenager and offered to look after her, she did \"a very nasty thing\". She still felt furious, believing he had taken her from her family, and so she cooked a bacon sandwich in front of him. \"I thought he wouldn't want to know me because I would be unclean,\" she says. Leila learned English quickly but in Kent in the 60s stuck out. \"Everybody wanted to be my friend. They used to fight over me. I was the teacher's pet and I was so cheeky, I would do anything to try to stop them favouring me.\" She soon forgot Swahili and Arabic but never her family. Aged 10, she was put up for adoption. \"I refused to be adopted because I said, 'I know my parents are alive \u2013 I want to find them.'\" The authorities said her parents were dead. Leila explained that they had left Zanzibar before the revolution. No one believed her and no officials ever helped her to look for them. Leila thought about returning to Zanzibar and trying to track down her mother, but was afraid of being persecuted for having fled with the sultan; and she was terrified of being rejected by her parents. She still did not know why she had been taken to the palace. As a teenager, Leila would travel to London to visit the three older girls from Zanzibar who had been sent to the same children's home. These girls were related to each other and all had contact with their families. That made Leila feel more alone than ever and she remembers weeping all the way home on the coach from Victoria. On one visit, she went to the bathroom to cry. When she came out, her friend's husband sensed she was upset and promised that when he next visited Zanzibar he would find her family. He later left a photograph of Leila at the post office in Stone Town, where a friend of Leila's mother saw it. Finally, Leila received a letter from her mother. She replied eagerly but was disheartened when her mother's letters asked for money. Later, she learned that the person her mother got to write the letters in English had slipped in demands for money. On another occasion, Leila managed to speak to her mother on the phone. \"She said 'Nakupenda sana' [I love you very much] in Swahili. I understood exactly what she was saying. It was just lovely to hear her voice, it was so soft and gentle.\" But then Leila lost touch with her mother: letters went unanswered and, it turned out, crossed in the post. Meanwhile, her father had remarried in Yemen. Leila received a brief letter in Arabic, and wrote back. He then sent a copy of her birth certificate, which she had never seen. In one long letter she told him about her life and that she had become a Christian. \"I felt I had to honour him and tell him. He wrote back to me giving me his blessing.\" That was the last she heard from her father before he died. As she found out more, Leila discovered she had a younger brother in the United States, working as a truck driver in Kansas. He regularly visited their aunts and cousins in Kenya and so, tentatively, Leila began to plan a trip with her eldest daughter, Natalie, for her 50th birthday, hoping to be reuinted with her mother at last. Six months before the trip, her cousin, Maimuna, wrote to tell Leila that her mother had died three years before. She went to Mombasa with Natalie anyway. After 43 years, she wanted answers, to fill in the blanks. Most of all, she wanted to know why she had been sent to the palace. Having feared rejection, when she met her aunts and cousins she was overwhelmed by a new sense of how central she had remained to her mother's life. \"There is no day we'll be with your mother and she'll stop talking about you,\" Maimuna had written. Leila discovered that her mother always remembered her birthday, and her cousins knew all about her. It was only on her second trip back to Zanzibar that Leila found out why she had been left at the palace. An old friend of her uncle's explained that her father had had a breakdown when the marriage ended, and her uncle agreed to look after her. He told the sultan her father had gone \"crazy\" and that the sultan would have to look after her. This, and the fact that Leila came from the same tribe as the sultan, explained the ruler's sense of obligation towards the coffee seller's daughter. This, Leila understands now, was why the sultan had held on to the screaming girl who kept running away, plucked her away from the bloody uprising and brought her to a strange country. Leila speaks to her brother in Kansas almost daily on the internet. The person she has not made contact with since her teens is the sultan. \"I'm not angry with him at all, now that I know the circumstances. All the anger that was in me \u2013 I never knew the truth of anything,\" she says. For years, the sultan has lived quietly in Portsmouth. He is in his 80s now. Would she ever agree to see him again? Leila smiles. \"I would love to meet him again,\" she says.",

This, and the fact that Leila came from the same tribe as the sultan, explained the ruler's sense of obligation towards the coffee seller's daughter. This, Leila understands now, was why the sultan had held on to the screaming girl who kept running away, plucked her away from the bloody uprising and brought her to a strange country.</p> <p>Leila speaks to her brother in Kansas almost daily on the internet. The person she has not made contact with since her teens is the sultan. \"I'm not angry with him at all, now that I know the circumstances. All the anger that was in me \u2013 I never knew the truth of anything,\" she says.</p> <p>For years, the sultan has lived quietly in Portsmouth. He is in his 80s now. Would she ever agree to see him again? Leila smiles. \"I would love to meet him again,\" she says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The majority of people, having fallen in love and got engaged, talk about plans for the wedding day, not about the potential for divorce. Unless they've got Paul McCartney's money and marital history, they don't debate the merits of a prenuptial agreement or consider whether it's a good idea to seek legal advice before tying the knot. But then most people don't spend all day thinking about divorce, child residence and the financial wrangles of the once-in-love. Most people aren't like my husband, Alex, one of the country's leading family lawyers; a man who charges a fairly high hourly rate to listen to very rich people talk about their miserable marriages. When we met, Alex's parents had been happily married for 40 years, but he had the jaundiced attitude to long-term monogamy that you'd expect from the offspring of Elizabeth Taylor. I was very different. Despite years of failed relationships, I was still a hopeful believer in the power of true love. As an avid reader and writer of novels, I like happy endings and these often involved soulmates meeting and a good wedding. Alex's world, in contrast, is all about the unhappy ever after. While I was daydreaming through my 20s, wondering when I'd meet the perfect man, he was rising up through the ranks of a profession that was all about the death of romance. With such different perspectives, we shouldn't have been able to get beyond the first date, let alone to a permanent commitment, but somehow we did. Our positions appeared to be those of the cliched man and woman: him paling at the mention of settling down and me horrifying my feminist self with thoughts of rings and dresses. I'd like to say that love conquers all and, while it's true that we were besotted, what really drove Alex to commit was dogged bullying on my part. I whined and I cajoled. It worked, but not without guilt on my part and resentment on his. I felt sure that what we had was strong enough to combat his view of marriage as doomed to end in acrimony, but it didn't stop me spending most of our wedding day whispering apologies in his ear. And in the 11 years we've been together, his experience at work has taught me some lessons about relationships. I'd never be so hubristic as to say they have inoculated us against marital breakdown, but they may have made it a bit less likely that we'll be needing the services of one of his colleagues. His first rule on how to avoid the divorce lawyer's offices is to \"marry someone sensible\", though he uses somewhat pithier and less PC language to express the sentiment. Many of us saw Betty Blue at a formative age and so associate love with derangement and drama. I was previously engaged to a man with whom I'd get very drunk and argumentative, one time smashing a framed photo of his first wedding over a chair. By all means go out with the wild ones, but when it comes to settling down, Alex believes you should remember that marriage isn't a romantic pact. It's a long-term business contract. He's a man who drinks and dances to excess and always bets everything on one card in poker, but there's no room for gambling when partnership is concerned. He and I could have been set up by matchmaker, our backgrounds and educations are so similar. Forget Romeo and Juliet, our families were divided only by the A428 that cuts across Cambridgeshire. I travelled round the world only to end up with the boy almost next door, as if my horizons were as limited as those of a Jane Austen heroine. Even our teenage rebellions had been identical, leaving us with the exact same opinions on everything from AV to VAT. Boring though this is, it does mean you cut down on the potential for argument. The next directive he will give our children is \"Don't marry an Australian\". It's not that he's got anything against Antipodeans \u2013 in fact, some of our best friends \u2026 and all that \u2013 but access to children is much trickier if you're having to negotiate it across 10,000 miles. Or the 1,500 miles to Russia. Or across the Atlantic to the US. Having married someone not Australian and quite tediously sensible, my husband's next greatest principle is that our lives should remain similar to one another's. The most common problem he sees at the office is when two people change radically over their marriage: the internet geek who becomes surprisingly attractive to women upon making millions; the high-achieving woman who gives up a career to dabble in interior design; the nimble-footed teenage boy who marries his childhood sweetheart before he becomes a world-famous professional footballer. When we met, our salaries were equal and our lack of interest in our domestic surroundings on a par. Then children came along, my career stalled and I became obsessive about stemming the tide of filth and plastic toys from silting up our house. His salary had risen sharply as the firm he set up became more successful, while what I earned barely covered minimal childcare. My brain was addled by the lack of sleep and all the love and anxiety that comes of having a newborn in the house. I was tempted to give up the pretence of a career to claim that I was putting my family before myself, especially as his salary could comfortably support us. He was adamant that this should not happen and that I must contribute to the mortgage. Why? He would be concerned about his position in law, as a middle-class man with a short marriage behind him, one child and a wife who is not working. When couples like that divorce, the law not infrequently applies the paternalistic assumption that she should never work again, and the onus is on the husband to support her for ever, even beyond the child's 18th birthday. (This principle is rarely applied if the roles are reversed.) So I persevered with working from home during nap times and at nights, though it seemed financially and emotionally unrewarding. He'd ask me what I had achieved each day and sometimes I would fib a little, as I felt like I had nothing to show for my toil. With hindsight, he was right. I'm lucky to have work that I can fit around my family and which I enjoy, but I wouldn't be in this position had I not got through those difficult early years with small babies. It would have been damaging to both of us if I had not been able to earn money of my own. So it's not all bad being married to a divorce lawyer. There can't be many other areas of the law as interesting \u2013 I can't imagine discussing conveyancing or commercial litigation. His work revolves around money and sex \u2013 and for a novelist there are no greater topics. (He never reveals details of individual cases.) Others are just as interested in his work as I am. Divorce, especially when it involves the wealthy, exerts the same fascination as crime novels \u2013 we read about it with the hope that it never happens to us or with the schadenfreude towards rich people squabbling over pennies and pets. As London has become the \"divorce capital of Europe\", the number of cases involving mind-boggling sums has risen, and even broadsheets fill their pages with detailed reports from the high court. I'll never be able to avail myself of his professional services and, in the event of a divorce, I'm scuppered, given who I'd be up against. But despite, or even because of, his unromantic talk of contracts, equity and parity, we've both learned that what binds people for the long term is more than just legalities. They may be corny words with no place in a court of law, but respect, gratitude and tenderness play their part too.

This was not an easy time for the Emmerdale fan. One longed for an unexpected close-up of a trough or a light-hearted breakdown of the costs entailed in repairing the milking shed, but no. All we got were endless shots of Moira scowling at a spreadsheet and Declan saying \"incremental loan agreement\", repeatedly, behind a fence. And now it's back. Here a debt, there a debt, everywhere a debt-debt. Still, at least this time around the financial murk comes with a tangible sense of doom. To wit: a cow has contracted conjunctivitis. There is an unattended bucket by the sheep barn. Surly dullard Adam is attempting to deal with his grief by threatening dastardly squire Declan, whose plans for a summer festival include the Bartons' lower fields and a bill featuring music acts that will be invented at a later date by younger members of the Emmerdale production team. But there is another, more pressing concern. Currently, Butler's Farm supplies approximately 98.7% of the soap's rural ambience. (The remainder being provided by Zak's beard.) Were it not for the incessant kerchaaaank of its rusting agricultural machinery and the anguished lowing of unseen livestock, Emmerdale would just be Hollyoaks in a padded gilet. For this reason alone, it is imperative that Moira doesn't sell up. Seriously hen, dinnae do it. A future spent watching Amy clipping her toenails over the bath without the accompaniment of canned goose noises is just too bleak to contemplate. In Coronation Street, the soap's strict one-in, one-out policy saw the departure of Milton Fanshaw and the return of Lewis Archer, a manoeuvre conducted so swiftly it was difficult to tell where one cravat ended and the other began. While Milton buggered off back to Palm Springs (Sylvia: \"He was a lovely man \u2026 in isolation\") inveterate cad Lewis breezed through the revolving door in a cloud of Paco Rabanne, drawling toffily about repentance and just deserts and epiphanies re: \"the emptiness of the life I had chosen\". Deirdre punched him in the Rovers but Audrey's knees wobbled afresh, her lust for a life beyond the heated rollers and liver spots of the salon having long since trampled any residual common sense to dust. Further bastardry was afoot at No 13, where Tracy's plans to humilate Beth bore dangly, disgusting fruit. Swaddled in a flammable chemise, baps akimbo, Beth invited unsuspecting ex Steve McDonald to help her with her gusset, an incident that ended, seconds later, in (Steve's) horror and (Beth's) devastation (\"What a waste of a bath.\"). Crap times in EastEnders, where heartbreak has stripped Arthur \"Fatboy\" Chubb of his mojo. Formerly Walford's in-house exclamation mark, the crushed wide boy is now operating at a reduced capacity, his interest in funtimes reduced to sod all by Whitney, who's dumped him in favour of priapic goon Tyler Moon.

Everybody's cool inniiiiiiiiiiit,\" he squawked desperately in the caff, eyes moistening and plumage bristling, before doing disco fingers at the lino and some manner of \"bird semaphore\" at those who hadn't already fled in terror. The noise was almost enough to drown out Michael \"Mad\" Moon's power-conflab with Janine \"Also Mad\" Butcher which, for the purposes of Drama, was conducted in some bar or other at the top of the Gherkin. \"Separately we're good but together we could be great,\" he droned, smirkily. \"MARRY ME.\" London shuddered; the bar's lone waiter retched discreetly into an ice bucket. Pregnant Janine gazed blankly and envisioned a future of compatible psychoses and the patter of tiny hedge funds. \"Yessss,\" she hissed, Janinely. \"Let's conquer the world, baby!\" Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do If you're affected by any of the issues on this page, you can talk about them at theguardian.com/tv-and-radio",

Everybody's cool inniiiiiiiiiiit,\" he squawked desperately in the caff, eyes moistening and plumage bristling, before doing disco fingers at the lino and some manner of \"bird semaphore\" at those who hadn't already fled in terror.</p> <p>The noise was almost enough to drown out Michael \"Mad\" Moon's power-conflab with Janine \"Also Mad\" Butcher which, for the purposes of Drama, was conducted in some bar or other at the top of the Gherkin.</p> <p>\"Separately we're good but together we could be great,\" he droned, smirkily. \"MARRY ME.\" London shuddered; the bar's lone waiter retched discreetly into an ice bucket. Pregnant Janine gazed blankly and envisioned a future of compatible psychoses and the patter of tiny hedge funds. \"Yessss,\" she hissed, Janinely. \"Let's conquer the world, baby!\"</p> <p>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do</p> <p><em>If you're affected by any of the issues on this page, you can talk about them at theguardian.com/tv-and-radio</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The lucky thing is, says Susan Calman, that although she is \"an eternal worrier, occasionally I do something stupid.\" And so, some time after her 30th birthday and one five-minute gig in a club in Glasgow, she decided to give up her successful, well-paid job as a corporate lawyer to become a comedian. \"I think I earned \u00a3250 that year,\" she says. \"It really was the stupidest thing I could have done, but also the best thing. I just thought, if I don't do it now, I'm never going to.\" Now, at 37, the years of work have started to pay off. Calman has three Edinburgh festival shows behind her, and a new one this year; she has been a regular panellist on Radio 4's News Quiz and popped up on Have I Got News for You; she is acting in and writing sitcoms \u2013 including one with Sandi Toksvig commissioned by the BBC \u2013 and has just been nominated for a Chortle comedy award, one of only two individual women out of 54 nominations (but we'll come to that). We sit, with pots of tea, by the window. It isn't just her size \u2013 she is 4ft 11in, and has the tiniest hands I've seen of anyone over the age of eight \u2013 that makes her seem childlike; she also has an openness and cheerful excitability, and not a trace of cynicism. It makes her extremely likable. But there's a brisk, businesslike side to her too, and a work ethic that is relentless and slightly scary. When her partner, a lawyer, goes to work, so does Calman, sitting at her desk until 6pm writing, often followed by gigs in the evening. She is also prone to insomnia, sleeping for just two or three hours a night, so she will get up and work. \"Coming to it later in life, I've got an absolute drive. To say you have a job you love is a remarkable thing, so you shouldn't squander it sitting in your pants watching Jeremy Kyle.\" As a child, Joyce Grenfell and Hattie Jacques were her first comedy influences. \"Then The Young Ones, and then I found French and Saunders, and Victoria Wood, but it really started with Grenfell and Jacques \u2013 maybe it was because they were different-looking and I knew I was never going to be 5ft 8in and blonde that I identified with them.\" Becoming a lawyer, she says, was just something you did \"if you've got exam results. I was rubbish at science so I couldn't be a doctor, and I thought law sounds all right, there's a job at the end.\" It was probably also what was expected from a fairly traditional background \u2013 Calman was educated privately, and is the daughter of Sir Kenneth Calman, former chief medical officer of Scotland and chairman of the Commission on Scottish Devolution (her parents are banned from her shows because \"they're a bit sweary\"; she means her gigs, not her parents). She was a lawyer for seven years and enjoyed some of it, \"but most importantly, it gave me another life. I've had a job, I've paid taxes, I've been miserable, I've been happy. I know what it feels like to be someone on a Friday night coming home from work and I know my job is to try to make [those people] slightly happier. I've got a different viewpoint than if I was young and starting in comedy.\" Calman doesn't remember much about her first gig at the Stand club in Glasgow \u2013 not being on stage, not what she said, not how the audience reacted \u2013 \"But I do remember at one point thinking, this is the best thing I've ever done in my life.\" She pauses. \"I think I was sick afterwards.\" (She still gets very nervous before a show, but her trick is to roll bits of Blu-Tack between her fingers, usually secreted in her pocket, to calm her hands, which always shake.) What did she like about being on stage? \"I think most comedians have a little bit of their soul missing where they need to get on stage on a Friday night in front of strangers and say, 'Please clap, please laugh, I require this attention',\" she says with a smile. Does she really mind what people think? \"I mind completely, and I shouldn't. I never read reviews, I never Google myself, but I do care what people think about what I've done, or that they think I'm quite a nice person. It's sad, isn't it?\" When she has written something, \"especially if it's personal \u2013 because a lot of the stuff I do is \u2013 and it works, it's an extraordinary feeling. There's no feeling like it. My better half is a remarkable woman, but I remember early on I had done some gigs and I didn't have any more, and I was grumpy, and she said something like 'am I not enough for you?' I had to say, 'well I do love you but \u2026 '\" Calman once said growing up gay in Glasgow \"was as easy as being a vegan abattoir worker\". When I remind her of this she says \"it wasn't easy, not at all. Glasgow is a lovely city, but when I was growing up there was one lesbian bar, and there was a club for men, but there was no internet, there was no way of finding out [about other people]. It was in the middle of Section 28 [the legislation banning the promotion of homosexuality] and it wasn't a very good time.\" I ask if she was bullied at school and she says, \"I think bullied would be over-dramatic,\" but she was an unhappy teenager. \"Looking back, [coming to terms with] my sexuality had more to do with my unhappiness than I care to admit. At the time, there was nobody to talk to about it or see that it was normal. I think some of my isolation came from that, and the feeling of not fitting in well very much comes from that time.\" Her show at Edinburgh this year is called This Lady's Not for Turning Either. \"It's not about Margaret Thatcher, but it is about growing up with Section 28 and the fact that her policies have made me sure I'm never turning politically.\" It's \"stories about how horrific I am to live with\", but \"I also wanted to cover something that was very important to me, which is not being allowed to marry someone I have been with for such a long time\". Calman came out when she was 19, \"and I thought something might have changed by now\". She has been with her partner for nine years, and they are registering their civil partnership in the summer. Meanwhile, the Scottish government has had a consultation on whether same-sex marriage should be introduced. \"It's about equality, it's about having the choice,\" says Calman. \"And it's about the things that are said about why I'm not allowed to get married \u2013 I read in a paper that 'gay people were a shame on Scotland' and in 2012 that is a distressing thing to read. It feels like you live your life \u2026 \" She pauses and her eyes well up. The swiftness of it is quite shocking, and she is quiet for a few seconds. \"It will change. We just keep going.\" Calman did a gig once, early in her career, where she asked a man what he did for a living and he said, \"I kill fat dykes\", and the rest of the crowd cheered. She walked off. \"That's what you do with that,\" she says. Another man in the front row, on a different night, said, \"I'm going to rape you.\" \"The gig essentially stopped and I had a conversation with the guy. I don't want to shout at him, I want to make him understand why it's unacceptable.\" Then she adds, \"I don't want this to sounds like Susan whingeing. I've done hundreds of gigs with nothing like that happening.\" Does she think the abuse women comics get tends to have a sexist dimension? \"It tends to be based on our looks, or something sexual, but women out on the street, that's what gets shouted at them. I'm not special because I'm a comedian.\" It brings us to the inevitable subject of women in comedy. It is something Calman has spoken about \u2013 in 2009, she organised a protest at the Edinburgh festival, bringing together around 80 female comics for a photograph to \"empirically\" prove there were women doing standup \u2013 but at the same time she seems weary of the topic. She takes a deep breath, and suddenly she's all lawyerly, talking in measured tones. \"It's a difficult issue that follows all of us around. Some people do not like female comics. I don't know what's in the mind of someone else, I don't know if someone is prejudiced, the only thing I can do is work as hard as I can until people can no longer ignore me, turn up for everything I'm booked for and do it to the best of my ability.\" Last month, Mark Linsey, the BBC's controller of entertainment commissioning, acknowledged the BBC had failed to promote enough women comedians. \"We don't have enough female comedians on television \u2013 that's something we are aware of and trying to do something about,\" he said. How does Calman feel about this? \"I don't ever want to get anything in life because someone's made a special case for me. Law is a very misogynistic profession, probably worse than comedy, and I didn't sit at my desk and say, 'I'm not being promoted because I'm a woman'. I think the more of an issue we make of it, the more difficult it becomes.\" Great strides are being made by women, she says, that aren't necessarily recognised by awards committees. \"People like Sarah Millican, who is really successful. Watson &amp; Oliver are on now [on BBC2], Anna &amp; Katy are very funny, and Miranda, and there's more. Working with people like Sandi and Annie Griffin [who directed the Channel 4's Fresh Meat, in which Calman appeared], I'm in a new show called Dead Boss, which is written by Sharon Horgan and has Jennifer Saunders in it. I don't know if everyone expects some big bang where women are suddenly on television all the time. That's not going to happen, but a few of us will come through, start changing perceptions and it will become the norm, and that's all I want.\" There is the idea that women don't fare well on \"testosterone-fuelled\" (Victoria Wood's words) panel shows, but isn't it sexist to assume all women are intimidated by them? \"I don't have a problem being in a competitive environment,\" says Calman. \"If people had sat in an office with some of the people I used to work with as a lawyer, that's competitive. It's more that a lot of people on those shows are gag merchants. If you don't tell one-liners, that's not the best showcase for you. It's very much about who you want to be as a comic.\" The comedians who excite her are \"people like Mark Thomas, Jeremy Hardy, Andy Zaltzman, who are doing really interesting political stuff. With an hour-long show, you can talk about things and ideas, and you don't need to do a punchline every few seconds. I want to make people laugh \u2013 nobody wants to see me give a lecture \u2013 but I'd like people to see a show and find out something about me, or feel something. I'm interested in the emotions you feel when you watch comedy.\" What does Calman want? Sell-out, stadium-level stardom? \"No, I like to see the whites of people's eyes,\" she says. \"Do you remember Tutti Frutti? It's still the best comedy I've ever seen. If I can write something in my life that's as good as that, or close to it, I'll be happy. I didn't start doing this to be recognised in the street, I did this because I've wanted it for years.\" She gathers her things, and in this light suddenly looks so young that she reminds me of a child packing up at the end of school. \"I figure if I keep doing as much as is humanly possible, something will maybe work.\" Susan Calman's new show This Lady's Not For Turning Either can be seen at this year's Edinburgh fringe festival.

      "bodyText": "\"Gee, Howard \u2013 this bit where it says, 'He pisses on her tits' \u2013 can we smooth that?\" \"Oh sure, how about if he says, 'I'm going to eat jelly off her tits'? They fucking loved it!\" It's not until Howard Overman starts laughing about toning down some of the \"coarser, rougher edges\" of Misfits for the US version that it's possible to reconcile the wild and often filthy streams of consciousness he's written for his asbo superheroes with the polite chap sitting in a Hove pub drinking grapefruit and soda. Over three series of Misfits, he's hit on a rich seam of youth culture: putting characters who are \"going out, getting laid, doing what people in their 20s do\" into outlandish situations \u2013 but then making sure that their reactions are real, running a gamut that includes disbelief, freaking out and, well, boredom. Not a lot of that gung-ho, \"Ooh, great powers, great responsibilities, must save the world!\" stuff that seems an intrinsic part of the chemical balance of any American teen in the same unlikely situation. Misfits is very much a show of its time \u2013 it both looks and sounds great, thanks to some gritty cinematography and a soundtrack that runs from a theme tune by the Rapture back to the Velvets \u2013 and since it won the Bafta for Best Drama in 2010, it's fair to say Overman has been on something of a roll. He's worked with US pop culture guru Josh Schwartz (The OC, Chuck, Gossip Girl) on a pilot for a New York version of the show, he's sold his first screenplay to Sony Pictures (\"A comedic take on Terminator\"), he's started work on the fourth series of Misfits for E4 (due back before summer), and now he's meeting the Guardian to talk about his \"holistic detective\" Dirk Gently as it returns to BBC4 for a three-part series this week. It's fair to say that Gently is something of a shift from the Thamesmead teens \u2013 swapping lines like \"What the fuck is brunch?\" for a more stylised tone, incorporating Gently's wild flights of intellectual fantasy, where he riffs on \"the fundamental interconnectedness of all things\" and drinks a lot of tea. At the heart of both programmes, however, is an understanding that when you've got \"ridiculous things happening\" (zombie cheerleaders, alternative Nazi timestreams, robots stalking Cambridge) you've got to persuade an audience to \"go on a ride with you\" by making the characters feel \"of their time and place\". Even Misfits' early twist on the superhero genre \u2013 a lightning storm that gave people powers that reflected their personalities \u2013 served to ground the story rather than feeling like an excuse to get a bunch of effects shots on screen. Dirk Gently is based on a series of novels by the late Douglas Adams, the cult author behind The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. Overman first \"read and enjoyed\" the books, a kind of freewheeling riff on the Sherlock Holmes model, when he was 17, and saw \"great potential in the character\" of \"holistic detective\" Gently when he came back to them some 20 years later. As he points out, whenever you're writing a detective story it's hard to out-clever Holmes, or to come up with a \"unique detective methodology\" \u2013 but in Adams's tea-drinking agent of chaos he saw a fresh and different take that could work as an ongoing franchise. 'Doing a straight cop show doesn't hold any appeal for me \u2026 There's not much TV that doesn't benefit from a bit of humour' The 2010 pilot with Stephen Mangan, Darren Boyd and Helen Baxendale set the tone: more translation than straight adaptation, taking only some of the elements from the novels \u2013 like Dirk's belief in \"solving the whole crime\" and his refusal to pay his secretary, Janice, so that she'll keep turning up \u2013 and updating them. This may be because, unlike Sherlock, there are only three works to draw on \u2013 Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, The Long Dark Tea-Time Of The Soul and the unfinished The Salmon Of Doubt \u2013 so pretty soon, you've got to write new cases; for another, the budget wouldn't stretch to bringing some of Adams's more fantastical elements to TV, such as the Electric Monks or a sofa stuck in a hallway thanks to a time paradox. The budget did, however, encompass an Austin Princess for Dirk (Mangan) and assistant (\"Partner!\") Macduff to drive. Part \"piss-take\" of Inspector Morse's Jag, and part nod to Overman's dad who drove one (and would joke about how \"changing gears was like playing Russian roulette\"), it's a very British detail that adds to the overall sense of chaos \u2013 especially when you see their \"zen navigation\" version of a \"follow that car!\" moment: driving after whoever is in front of them in the blind hope that they'll end up where the case needs them to be. Overman's career path has been convoluted, too. Ditching office life in \"various crappy project manager and marketing jobs, all of which I was rubbish at\" for script-writing (\"I hated having to make conversation with people I didn't like\") Overman worked on Hotel Babylon, New Tricks and Merlin, but it was only when he came up with his \"Skins meets Heroes\" concept that he made a mark. Misfits was well-placed to capitalise on a more receptive commissioning environment after the successful reinvention of Doctor Who and a mainstream hit like Life On Mars \u2013 itself a hard sell that famously languished in development hell for years before BBC1 jumped in. As Overman knows, it wasn't always easy to convince people to take a punt on high-concept scripts like \"time-travelling cop\". \"I can remember pitching an idea before Life On Mars \u2013 except my guy was a dentist. Like those 80s shows like The A-Team where they'd go around helping any old fucker, the idea was that he'd help people because he was plagued with guilt; his wife had died, he caused the crash, you didn't know if he was alive or dead. At the time they couldn't get their heads round what I wanted to do. I might resurrect the idea next year. Now they'd probably all go, 'Oh yeah! A dentist!'\" If there's a thread tying Overman's work together, he's says it's finding \"a comedic take on genre\". For example, his film, The Slackfi Project, is about an ordinary guy working in a coffee shop, where two guys show up and tell him he's got to save the world \u2013 what Overman refers to as \"sci-fi now\", a clash between sci-fi and the norms of conventional life. \"I like the structure of genre and the complexity of the stories; they're big, dramatic stories that take you into another world. I have a tendency to not take things too seriously, so I undercut it with a bit of comedy. Doing a straight cop show doesn't hold any appeal for me. 'Did you do it? No I didn't' \u2013 it's a long 60 minutes. There's not much TV that doesn't benefit from a bit of humour \u2013 even something like The Sopranos \u2013 it's really funny in moments. Tony's girlfriend will throw a big steak at him and it will just hit him in the face \u2013 that's real Tom and Jerry \u2013 yet it's in the context of a plot which turns quite nasty. Sometimes 'serious British drama' almost fails to have any humanity on some levels because you can't live your life that earnestly; 'this is life or death' all the time. Even in the most dire situations people tend to crack jokes and muck around, and there are very few dramas that can't be improved with a bit of humour.\" Dirk Gently, Mon 5 March, 9pm, BBC4",

      "bodyText": "\"Oh fuck off!\" The words are out of my mouth before I have a chance to think about the ramifications of saying them to a Hollywood actor, especially one whose star is about to turn supernova. As soon as I do, I think I might throw up. And then, after the briefest of pauses, Taylor Kitsch's perfect eyes wrinkle up and his perfect mouth emits a perfect laugh, all manly and throaty and sounding of a thousand cigarettes. The incident occurs just after Kitsch has finished telling me about the house he's building by a lake in Austin, Texas, and the boat, which he sails upon said lake. It comes after he's said how much he loves England (\"I love the dry, wry humour\"), and doesn't like LA (\"It's too one-sided\"); all punctuated with swearing, jokes and the confidence of a man who can wear cowboy boots, bootcut jeans (well, he does live in Texas) and still look absurdly attractive. I don't mean to curse at him, but it is almost too much to take, all of this, and the vision of him building a house just doesn't seem fair to the rest of the population, neither male nor female. If there was a real-life, modern-day Adam, or if Gosling in The Notebook really did exist, it would be in the form of the man sitting in front of me. Which is probably why he's saving the planet in two films this spring. First up is John Carter, a Disney action behemoth based on the 1964 book by Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs; then comes the guns-blazing Battleship, in which he stars alongside Liam Neeson and Rihanna. As if that isn't enough, Kitsch will follow with Oliver Stone's Savages, in which he plays a pot grower taking on a Mexican drug cartel to rescue his girlfriend (Blake Lively). It might seem a brazen burst on to the scene but Kitsch, 30, has done his time in the waiting room. There was the almost career as a hockey player in his native Canada, until injury got the better of him, then a move to New York and a brief stint as a model. During that time he studied acting on the side and won small roles in forgettable films such as Snakes On A Plane and John Tucker Must Die. There was a stint in LA, living \u2013 literally \u2013 out of his $1,100 car, in between auditioning for parts. But it was not until getting cast as Tim Riggins in American football TV drama, Friday Night Lights \u2013 a spin off from the 2004 film \u2013 that his career kick-started his career in earnest. \"I played a high school kid at 26, 27; I still never use a razor, maybe to spite him,\" grins Kitsch, reclining back into his sofa. \"But I love that role, man. I was told it was to be supporting at the beginning: you're going to be used incrementally, you could be gone by the first season. But it turned out to be quite the opposite. They gave me the empowerment to be really free. No rehearsals and the most important thing to me was to be able to improv. I love to throw curveballs; all those quotes people come up to me and say about Riggins, I'd say 90% are from the improv. I'd be like, 'Hey, this paragraph here? Literally not going to do it. Just going to do a look right here.' And they'd be like, 'Let's try it!'\" The confidence the role gave him obviously worked. It led to meatier parts, playing war photographer Kevin Carter in 2010's The Bang Bang Club and Gambit in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. And FNL also saw Kitsch forge a friendship with the show's director, Peter Berg, who hand-picked him for the lead role of Alex Hopper in Battleship. \"Pete and I go way back,\" says Kitsch, grinning, and extolling his pal in language you might expect from a veteran of a US sports drama. \"He came to pitch Battleship to me and that alone is incredible; we're friends first and foremost and we've gone through a lot together personally, so it's a big risk to ask a close friend to get in the trenches with you on a different level. Because making movies is fucking tough and you're going to bat heads and you're going to challenge each other. But I think that was why I signed on, to go to battle with Pete.\" 'For 11 months, I was on a regimen of training and dieting. I was working six-day weeks. I would get my wake-up call at 4.33am' Before Battleship, however, is John Carter \u2013 or \"JC\" as Kitsch likes to call him \u2013 an American civil war veteran transported from Earth to Mars. Not the easiest of premises to sell, but with the help of giant billboards featuring a long-haired Kitsch half-naked save for a loin cloth, one that has the potential to sell itself. It's his first lead role, and the pressure is on. \"I don't think anyone is going to put more on it than me,\" he says, ruffling that hair underneath his oversized beanie hat. \"Of course it's the grandeur of it all, and the effects. I don't have any power over that but the character is something you just dive into. For 11 months, I was on a regimen of training and dieting. I stayed four months at the Metropolitan hotel in Mayfair, right by Hyde Park, but I was working six-day weeks, so I literally went out once. I would get my wake-up call at 4.33am to train. But it's worth it; the aesthetic of John Carter \u2026 you can't fuck around with that.\" Was there a pie or two at the end of filming, then? \"Oh my god, if I even fucking told you how hard I partied after that \u2026\" he starts, going almost misty eyed. \"I rented an over-the-top house on the lake where I live in Austin, that I would never live in, like ridiculous; it was a joke. I flew in 11 of my friends, and my brother; friends that I grew up with and a few that I met through work. Eleven guys for five days, on the lake and going into the town. I fucking was a different person.\" He is a confident fellow, Taylor Kitsch. We are used to a more falsely humble Hollywood these days \u2013 \"Oh I'm so lucky, oh it just happened, oh I'm so blessed\" and so forth \u2013 but perhaps because he doesn't live there, Kitsch doesn't seem to suffer from that syndrome. He will happily tell you how hard he worked to get a role. He will sing praises of those he has learned from \u2013 Willem Defoe, Dominic West, or Benicio Del Toro \u2013 and cast shadows upon those he hasn't, dismissing their methods without naming names. It may sound over-bearing but with Kitsch, such self-belief seems to come from a genuine place of simply wanting to make things happen. You sense he's used to being the best. But it's not every ex-model pretty boy who manages to land two lead roles in a year, convincing studios to take a risk on a relative unknown. How did he manage to pull it off? \"Oh I threatened them quite often,\" he says, grinning. \"I would love to ask them that, too. I had a call from my manager saying the director, Andrew Stanton (Wall-E), wanted to meet me. The screen test was quite heavy; John Carter has quite a burden. I think getting that part of it was a big thing [for Stanton]. But he was so emphatic and his energy was so infectious, that I left the audition thinking, 'If he gives me a good kick at it, I'm going to fight for it, I'm going to throw my hat in the ring for sure.'\" 'John Carter tested me quite intensely. I literally suffered from exhaustion, passed out a couple of times. It took everything I had' For all his fighting talk, Kitsch is the first to admit that it was not an easy ride, and not only for the training that left him physically battered and bruised. \"John Carter tested me quite intensely,\" he says in a southern drawl that belies the fact he's actually from a tiny Canadian town called Kelowna. \"I literally suffered from exhaustion on John Carter, passed out a couple of times from it, so it took everything I had on that level. But also, emotionally. We shot the scene where his family are taken away from him, and that's 14 hours of Carter in mourning; that's intense. If it's Friday Night Lights, you can do it because you need two takes of raw emotion. You do it for literally about 30 minutes, if that, and then you're done. This was rough, but rewarding because when you see it cut in at certain spots, fuck it can hit ya, and I love that.\" He may be owning the action hero this year, but Kitsch is determined to be taken seriously as an actor. \"I love the story part of acting,\" he says. \"I love bringing people into the emotional part of it. My favourite scenes in John Carter are the emotional ones, especially when you can collaborate with Stanton, who can rip your heart out and make you cry laughing in the same breath.\" It's quite rare for an action picture to have a heart, I suggest; mostly it's just brawn and battles. \"It is, but if it was one of those movies, I wouldn't have done it.\" He pauses, then with the confidence dipping a notch, says, \"I was scared shitless with Bang Bang Club. Kevin Carter was a South African, drug-addicted, suicidal war photographer, and it was a true story that his family and best friend would see. Doing that justice is way more pressure \u2026 Then shooting Savages with Oliver Stone. I think that role will turn some heads in the sense of how unapologetic the character is. ThHe just doesn't give a fuck. But that's fun.\" It is an exciting time for Taylor Kitsch and if he plays things right, he could have just what he wants. Is he happy with where he is going? \"You work for years on end,\" he says, \"and it's not theatre where you can have that validation right away. You hope people love it, and you're proud of the work. I remember driving around Sunset Boulevard in the car that I was living in. Now you drive down Sunset and there is a huge John Carter billboard. I had probably about 25 people texting me about it, and that is a pretty cool feeling. But what I really love is how different these guys are. And that's the beauty of it, hopefully.\"",

But also, emotionally. We shot the scene where his family are taken away from him, and that's 14 hours of Carter in mourning; that's intense. If it's Friday Night Lights, you can do it because you need two takes of raw emotion. You do it for literally about 30 minutes, if that, and then you're done. This was rough, but rewarding because when you see it cut in at certain spots, fuck it can hit ya, and I love that.\"</p> <p>He may be owning the action hero this year, but Kitsch is determined to be taken seriously as an actor. \"I love the story part of acting,\" he says. \"I love bringing people into the emotional part of it. My favourite scenes in John Carter are the emotional ones, especially when you can collaborate with Stanton, who can rip your heart out and make you cry laughing in the same breath.\"</p> <p>It's quite rare for an action picture to have a heart, I suggest; mostly it's just brawn and battles. \"It is, but if it was one of those movies, I wouldn't have done it.\" He pauses, then with the confidence dipping a notch, says, \"I was scared shitless with Bang Bang Club. Kevin Carter was a South African, drug-addicted, suicidal war photographer, and it was a true story that his family and best friend would see. Doing that justice is way more pressure \u2026 Then shooting Savages with Oliver Stone. I think that role will turn some heads in the sense of how unapologetic the character is. ThHe just doesn't give a fuck. But that's fun.\"</p> <p>It is an exciting time for Taylor Kitsch and if he plays things right, he could have just what he wants. Is he happy with where he is going? \"You work for years on end,\" he says, \"and it's not theatre where you can have that validation right away. You hope people love it, and you're proud of the work. I remember driving around Sunset Boulevard in the car that I was living in. Now you drive down Sunset and there is a huge John Carter billboard. I had probably about 25 people texting me about it, and that is a pretty cool feeling. But what I <em>really</em> love is how different these guys are. And that's the beauty of it, hopefully.\"</p>",

Then, a beam of red from above cuts through the ship like it's plastic. Its source: an alien vessel, descending menacingly \u2026 The trailer looks every part the sci-fi sensation of this summer. But this isn't a movie coming to your local multiplex \u2013 at least not this year. It's a cinematic preview of Mass Effect 3, the final instalment of the videogame trilogy that's moved from cult status to commercial heavyweight. Developed by Canadian company BioWare, ME3 delivers a detailed universe, populated with well-rounded characters and a multitude of alien races. It is to videogames what the 2004 reboot of Battlestar Galactica was to TV: an engrossing experience weaving myriad plotlines into a narrative that reaches beyond sci-fi convention. ME3's lead writer, Mac Walters, explains how quiet words can resonate greater than dramatic actions: \"We have all of these fantastic characters participating in an epic overall story that spans galaxies but every one of them has these personal moments which will really connect to the audience. If the characters are going through something the player has personal experience of, then it's going to hold an appeal regardless of what genre it's placed in. It's unlikely that anyone has participated in intergalactic war, but many players will know what it's like to lose a loved one.\" Chicago-based games journalist Andrew Hayward argues that ME's strength is its dedication to detail. \"We have no shortage of games that utilise blazingly intense set-pieces to build tension and momentum, but fewer titles that really make you feel a part of the universe rather than just an observer of events. Mass Effect embraces both agendas with great success, and your choices have real weight in shaping the outcome.\" It's these choices that make the series different, shaping each game to each player. The selection of option A over B can affect the characters you'll find accompanying Commander Shepard on his (or her \u2013 Shepard can be played as either sex) ongoing missions if you choose to load the data from your previous games. In ME1, a heavy scenario necessitates a life-or-death choice between crew members, and whoever's left behind is wiped from ME1 and ME2. Come the climax of ME2, Shepard's entire crew can be annihilated, their fates dependent on the right (or wrong) choices earlier in the game. Sounds like a recipe for continuity disaster. \"We have to be hyper-aware of events in each individual's previous game,\" says Walters. \"We had a paragraph written on what would happen in ME3 when finishing up ME1; the story was straightforward, in a sense. But still, this game took months of planning to get a handle on every different permutation.\" 'The central theme \u2013 survival at any cost \u2013 was established early, but working out all of the various permutations took a great deal of work' \u2013 Mac Walters That \"straightforward\" story is, naturally, anything but. Nutshell: every 50,000 years or so an ancient race of biomechanical giants (Reapers) activate and eradicate the universe of intelligent life, effectively pressing the reset button. Prior to ME3 Shepard has stalled them, but they remain operational. \"We knew that them returning, specifically to our galaxy and Earth, gave us a fixed point in the future to work towards,\" says Walters, \"but taking all of those loose threads and bringing them together took months of planning. The central theme \u2013 survival at any cost \u2013 was established early, but working out all of the various permutations took a great deal of work.\" The investment has been worth it. ME2's average score on Metacritic stands at 96% for Xbox 360, and sales of the two games to date stand at around 7m. The hype seems enough to push that over the 10m mark in 2012, and could see the series spin into further media. High-spec trailers aside, the ME series' commitment to quality is confirmed by some savvy casting \u2013 Martin Sheen as secretive pro-humanist the Illusive Man; Seth Green as Joker, the wise-cracking pilot of the Normandy \u2013 and excellent graphical and audio design. The latter is complemented on ME3 by a score from Clint Mansell, the man behind movie soundtracks for Black Swan, Moon and The Wrestler. Speaking about his ME3 commission in 2011, he said: \"With [this game], you're like a DJ; you've a holding pattern, and then there's a big explosion when the score has to kick in. You have to figure out an overall symphony, but break it down into components. You can bring the pain, when required.\" And ME3 certainly does bring the pain. But there's no way anyone would mistake this for an out-and-out shooter. \"Players develop a unique connection to their own personal tale in Mass Effect,\" says Hayward, who's less certain that the series should transfer to cinema screens. \"Fans won't welcome a singular narrative that treads on their own experiences.\" \"Videogames and movies are merging,\" James Cameron told CNN in 2011. And, despite some reservations, Mass Effect's big-screen future seems mapped \u2013out \u2013 Legendary Pictures acquired the rights in 2010 \u2013 but Walters confirms BioWare aren't prepared to let it become another awful videogame adaptation. What isn't so clear is how the final entry in this trilogy progresses from the Reapers' assault of Earth to \u2026 Well, that would be telling. But get sucked into Shepard's story of tough choices and multiple endings and there'll certainly be no suntan for you this summer.",

No disrespect to Alice Eve, but I've been watching Kelly Macdonald for 16 years and somehow it just keeps getting more and more rewarding, especially in the last few, as she's broken out of second-tier parts and started taking more leads. She brings a steely kind of mildness to many of her roles, a quality \u2013 to my eye, a very Scottish quality \u2013 few other prominent actresses have: everything held back, the eyes giving it all away, the impression of great forces clashing inside what appears to be a tiny, vulnerable frame. She reminds me of what Tom Wolfe said of Joan Didion as a reporter; about being so small, frail-seeming and nervous that powerful figures were so disconcerted that they sometimes blurted out their darkest secrets to her, just to fill the air with something, anything. Maggie Smith and half the cast did that about 10 times to Macdonald in Gosford Park, of which she is the unheralded star. Not that Macdonald started out all meek and mild. If anything, her career has been overshadowed by her boldly atypical debut in Trainspotting as a sexually audacious underage schoolgirl, who knocks a swaggering Ewan McGregor off his stride and into her bed, and who howls at us from the movie's iconic poster wearing a next-to-nothing sequinned dress. Nothing much like that in the years since, though. If anything, in fact, there is a chasteness to Macdonald that reminds me of certain Japanese actresses of the 50s and 60s, particularly Yasujiro Ozu's muse, Setsuko Hara, the daughter-mother-sister archetype of so many of his infra-ordinary family dramas. Each of them, with their similarly kindly faces, is deft with the smaller, mundaner emotions, the little momentary dambursts of feeling, suppressed or redirected, or more rarely, submitted to. But don't let chasteness or meekness blind us to that steel, which was uncovered in State Of Play and, in a different way, in The Girl In The Cafe, a bad movie that needed Macdonald without ever quite earning or deserving the things she managed to do for it. In No Country For Old Men, she was at her most vulnerable, but remained the last unbreakably honest person in that movie's harsh moral universe. Then Macdonald finally got a richly conceived lead role in Boardwalk Empire, where she was at leisure to unwrap, week by week, her increasingly complex and contradictory character: an Irish widow of modest demeanour who may yet prove as Machiavellian as her mobbed-up boyfriend.
