      "bodyText": "Opposition leaders said that Russia's presidential elections on Sunday were even more rigged than December's parliamentary elections. With a record number of observers at polling stations, election day was a fever of accusations of fixed votes on the social media outlets that are the main medium for the opposition. Opposition leader and anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, installed in a bar in the centre of the city, claimed by early afternoon that it was already clear that there were more violations at this election than at the parliamentary elections in December. \"It is not an election. Even the counting of votes is not honest,\" he said. Election watchdog Golos and other observers reported the use of so-called carousels, where voters are brought round on buses to vote many times. Undercover journalists had exposed the practice in the December elections, one of many violations that sparked Russia's biggest street protests since the end of the Soviet Union. Navalny said that the carousels were being discovered in Moscow and other big cities because of the number of new observers, who had received training beforehand to report on the elections. Political activist Ksenia Sobchak staged a press conference with a girl who admitted to taking money to take part in a carousel. There were also reports of mass voting by absentee ballots in Moscow, which election watchers described as suspicious as it could allow voting multiple times. Many polling stations ran out of absentee ballots before the election. One report suggested that people were being forced to collect absentee ballots and a man was arrested a few days before the election for selling them. \"People were on their knees saying: you know we will be sacked if we do not bring absentee ballots,\" Irek Vuldanov, an election official outside Moscow told gazeta.ru website. There were also numerous reports of election observers being expelled from polling stations and other minor violations. Golos website reported more than 1000 complaints about violations. Environmental campaigner Yevgenia Chirikova wrote on Twitter (in Russian) that immigrant workers were going to polling stations having been given instructions by their employer on who to vote for. Putin's campaign chief, Stanislav Govorukhin, rejected the claims of violations, calling them \"ridiculous\". \"This is the cleanest election in Russia's entire history,\" he said. \"The violations our rivals and the opponents of our president will now speak of are laughable.\" Russia's election commission dismissed the complaints. \"These complaints are prepared ahead of time and the initiators of such actions are not at all interested in questions of objectivity and the lawfulness of what has happened.\" Putin retains a strong degree of support throughout Russia and has always been way ahead of the other candidates in the race. The government installed web cameras in nearly all of the polling stations before the election as a response to fraud allegations and more than 2.5 million people signed up to use the service. Critics say that the costly move, at nearly $500m, was just a cosmetic measure to dissuade criticism. \"It is not an election, it is a disgrace,\" said Sergei Udaltsov, an opposition leader who has been jailed numerous times after protests. \"We will go onto the streets tomorrow.\"",

      "bodyText": "High turnout was everything that mattered for the Iranian leaders in parliamentary election on Friday. They were desperate to portray a country united against western pressure, predicted high turnout and announced more than 64% voted in the election, higher than 57% parliamentary vote in 2008. In absence of independent observers and opinion polls, it is impossible to say whether the official figures are correct. The opposition had largely boycotted the vote and was quick to find contradictory signs. They pointed to a gaffe made on live TV by Seyed Solat Mortazavi, the head of election centre at the interior ministry. On state television, Mortazavi quoted the interior minister, Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar, as saying that the turnout was almost 34%, but instantly corrected to 64%. The other blunder came from the Mehr news agency, which had reported 373,000 people eligible for voting in the province of Ilam. The same agency reported 380,000 had voted there. Mehr later amended the figure on its website to 280,000. Baztab, an Iranian news website, also reported that the total number of people eligible to vote announced by the regime was 2.5 million less than those eligible in the 2009 presidential vote. On Sunday the officials were still counting the votes. Reports say the results for 190 out of 290 seats in the parliament have now been finalised. Of the remaining seats, 30 have gone to the second round and 70 seats including those in Tehran are still being counted. Although the final results have not yet been announced, it's clear that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will have a hard time till the end of his term in 2013. The opposition were banned from contesting the election. Those competing for votes were factions from within the regime, conservatives supporting and opposing Ahmadinejad. Staunch supporters of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, look likely to win three-quarters of all seats and take control of parliament. The parliament looks likely to consist of the United Fundamentalists Front, a group of conservatives critical of Ahmadinejad and the Stability of Islamic Revolution Front, the other group of conservatives less critical of the president, few pro-Ahmadinejad figures and some independents. The president's sister, Parvin Ahmadinejad, was among those defeated by their conservative rivals. Ahmadinejad who was summoned to the parliament in February to answers questions over the government's handling of the economy and his own personal judgments, must appear before MPs by Friday. Many MPs who were behind the motion to impeach the president last year, including Ali Motahari, are likely to retain their seats. The results are unlikely to change Iran's foreign policy or nuclear programme as both are controlled by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Curiously, Fars, the news agency affiliated to the elite revolutionary guards, and generally hostile to women with improper hijab, published pictures of women in loose hijab participating in elections. And finally, the New York Times had a timely and interesting comment piece by Hooman Majd, the Iranian-American author of \"The Ayatollah Begs to Differ\", on the impact of western sanction on the lives of ordinary Iranians. \"The ever more stringent sanctions imposed on Iran may be 'biting,' but they are also stifling voices for change,\" he writes. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012. The original said the United Fundamentalists Front, appeared to have won three-quarters of all seats. That has now been corrected to say that staunch supporters of the supreme leader are likely to win three-quarters of all seats which include both the United Fundamentalists Front and the Stability of Islamic Revolution Front.",

      "bodyText": "Rory McIlroy fulfilled his long-predicted destiny on Sunday, becoming the No1-ranked player with victory over a charging Tiger Woods and one of the strongest fields of the nascent 2012 season, at the Honda Classic in Florida. The 22-year-old Northern Irishman is the second youngest player in history to ascend to the top of the sport's rankings. Woods made it to the summit in 1997 at the age of 21, an achievement that inspired a generation of young players of whom the new world No1 was one. McIlroy has long cited Woods as a boyhood hero. Now the pair are competitors, bound together by a rivalry that illuminated a thrilling afternoon at the US PGA National course in Tampa, as the American posted the best final round of his US PGA Tour career \u2013 an eight-under 62 - to give the McIlroy the fright of his young life. It was a moment of truth for the Northern Irishman, a signal that the tournament victory and No1 ranking would not come easily. His one-under round of 69 in response was solid if unspectacular, though in the context of the moment such matters of style hardly mattered. It was just enough to hold off Woods on the day and overtake Luke Donald at the top of the rankings. \"Congrats. Enjoy the view!\" Donald tweeted. \"The way I won today was great. It was tough, especially seeing Tiger make a charge,\" McIlroy said. \"I knew par golf would probably be good enough. To shoot one-under in these conditions, when you go into the round with the lead, is very nice. And I was just able to get the job done.\" Nine shots behind McIlroy's overnight lead at the start of the day, the former world No1 rolled in four birdies and one eagle over the first 17 holes. Even then he remained three shots adrift and needing to eagle the par-five final hole to put on any kind of pressure. He duly produced, hitting a beautiful approach shot over the water to eight feet and rolling in the putt for a 62 and a 72-hole total of 10-under par, one shot behind. \"It's just building,\" Woods said of his game. \"I was putting together the pieces each and every day. I wasn't that far off, and it was just kind of building. I had a great time out there.\" It may have been great for Woods, but it still was not enough to deflect McIlroy from his purpose. With fans' roars echoing across the course, his reaction under pressure was worthy of his new ranking, rolling in an eight-foot downhill putt for birdie on the 13th hole to extend his lead to two shots. He followed that with a convincing under-and-down from the greenside rough at the 14th. The 15th, 16th and 17th holes at US PGA National \u2013 colloquially known as the 'Bear Trap' \u2013 are replete with sand and water and have ruined many a dream over the years. McIlroy hit a nervous tee shot on the par-three 15th but executed a beautiful recovery from a greenside bunker. A routine par at the 16th hole was followed by another good bunker on the penultimate hole for par. The par-five 18th offered the chance of a birdie but although there were also the risks presented by water around the green, McIlroy played it sensibly and safely, taking the regulation three shots to reach the green. Two putts for par secured the victory, his third on the Tour, and elevated him to the top of the rankings. Since the US PGA last August he has played in 11 ranking events and finished outside the top five in only one of them. \"It means an awful lot to be able to call yourself the No1 player in the world: it is a great achievement,\" he said. \"I am very honoured to join the list of guys who have held that spot. Hopefully I can keep a hold it for a little while.\"",

      "bodyText": "Two British journalists arrested last month by a Libyan militia group in a direct challenge to the authority of the country's new government have been accused of spying. The militia staged a late-night press conference in a Tripoli hotel to unveil what they said was evidence of improper activities. Gareth Montgomery-Johnson, 36, and reporter Nicholas Davies, 37, who work for Iran's state-owned Press TV, were arrested 23 February by a Misrata militia based in Tripoli. Dr Suleiman Fortia, a Misratan member of Libya's ruling National Transitional Council, said the militia had government authority to hold the men because they represented the \"February 17 Revolution\", the date on which Libya's revolution began last year. \"We are all part of the government, the militias and government are together,\" said Fortia. \"Intelligence services around the world have the authority to hold onto suspects while they are investigating them.\" He cited the example of Tripoli's militia commander, Abdul Hakim Bilhaj, who was detained by the United States in 2004 accused of terrorism in an operation Bilhaj has said Britain was complicit. The detention of the two men has already prompted protests from Amnesty International, which has demanded that the Libyan government take custody of the men and call the militia to account. In a sometimes rambling press conference, Fortia, flanked by camouflaged militiamen, showed what he said was suspicious material found on the two men. This included a field dressing in a black wrapper which he said was suspicious because it was \"made in Israel\" and lists of Tripoli militia members killed in clashes last year. Also presented were still photographs found on the men of Libyan militiamen in combat poses, a photocopy of an Iranian residence permit in one of the men's passports and what appeared to be a television editing script. Asked what was suspicious about the items, Fortia said \"further investigation\" would be necessary. The militia then screened footage found in the two men's computers, consisting of what appeared to be home movies showing the two men dancing in Tripoli's Martyr's Square over a music soundtrack. \"They also had pornography,\" said Fortia. He said he had informed Libya's interior and defence ministries, and had received no complaints about their decision to continue detaining the men. \"They [the ministries] all know what they are doing.\" Neither ministry has a press office and no officials were available for comment on Sunday night. \"We have the total responsibility for security in Tripoli,\" said Faraj al-Swehli, the militia commander. Fortia said the men would remain in detention in the former women's military academy on Tripoli's beachfront and that more inquiries would be needed to determine if they were spies. \"It is too early to decide. This is something that will be proved after further investigations.\" Swehli said: \"We have to protect the 17 February Revolution and not everyone who carries a camera is really a journalist.\" Their announcement will cause concern among diplomats already worried about the inability of Libya's authorities to rein-in militias, following the release of video footage showing a militia near Benghazi vandalising a British war graves site. Swehli's militia last week saw its main checkpoint in Misrata attacked by other militias of the city's military council, who accused it of holding captives in illegal detention. Protests are planned for Monday by Tripoli citizens against the continued presence in the city of militias from Misrata and other units from outside the Libyan capital, who they say are a threat to security.",

      "bodyText": "Uncertainty over the futures of the Rangers playing squad is expected to finally end on Monday, with decisions due regarding who will be sacked at Ibrox. Rangers' administrators, Duff and Phelps, have confirmed that about \u00a31m a month needs to be saved from the club's budget between now and the end of the season. The Rangers manager, Ally McCoist, held his latest round of talks with the administrators on Sunday. Rangers' woes continued with a 2-1 home loss to Hearts, 24 hours earlier. McCoist could lose up to eight of his first-team squad, although the matter is complicated by the willingness of some players to take pay cuts \u2013 or even play for free \u2013 for the remainder of this campaign. The manager himself is believed to have offered to go without wages until May. Sources have stressed it is reaching the required budget cut which is important, rather than the number of personnel who must depart for that target to be reached. Either way, a bleak Monday at Rangers beckons, with administrators ready to impose their own cull if no suitable consensus is reached between members of the playing staff. McCoist said: \"It's not my job, I'm not making anybody redundant, I'm not telling anybody they have lost their job. I won't be [in with the players] but I will be waiting outside if and when it happens. My job is to support and be there, which I will be. \"It's been really difficult for everybody. The one thing I would do is pay tribute to the entire staff. It's not just the players and the coaching staff - it's everybody here. I would pay tribute to the workforce at Ibrox and the workforce at Murray Park in what can only be described as extremely difficult circumstances. Morale and an inner strength to keep going and be there for each other, to me, is really evident and very strong. That will help us get through it.\" Paul Whitehouse, one of Rangers' joint administrators, admitted making such a significant financial cut will prove difficult as McCoist looks to keep a competitive team on the pitch for the rest of the season. \"That is the balance that is very difficult to strike and that's why it is not an immediate decision that could be made,\" Whitehouse explained. \"All the parties have bought into the difficulties and complexities of the process of trying to weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of each person. It is difficult, it's a challenge, but ultimately it is challenge we have got to face and deal with. \"We have to make sure we have a blend of players performing well on the pitch but also retain a business that is capable of attracting an investor.\"",

      "bodyText": "Roberto Mancini declared earlier this season that if Mario Balotelli were his son, he would attempt to stop the player from getting into trouble by giving him \"a kick up the arse\". Now, after newspaper photographs showed the striker leaving a Liverpool strip club at nearly 3am the day before hosting Bolton Wanderers, thereby breaking a club curfew for the second time in a matter of months, the manager suggested it was time to implement a new plan for curbing his compatriot's excesses: \"Two kicks up the arse!\" he trumpeted. Mancini was, of course, joking, speaking with the same mixture of amusement and exasperation that Balotelli tends to arouse. But the manager's intention to punish the player was real \u2013 and so, after meeting Balotelli yesterday to discuss his latest breach of discipline following a City career that has also included needless red cards and a notorious misadventure with fireworks, the manager is expected to impose the maximum permissible fine on the striker, docking him two weeks' wages. The sanction will come with a warning that if Balotelli does not mend his ways soon, he risks wasting his talent. \"This [fine] is not so much for me and for the squad \u2013 it's for him,\" said Mancini with almost paternal concern for the 21-year-old whom he regards as a loveable rogue but one whose roguishness must nonetheless be reined in. \"When you are a professional player you should have a good private life. You can't stay out until after 2am. He needs to understand this. Now he is young but when you are 25-26 it will be different if you don't have a good private life. You can't play at the top level.\" Of more immediate concern to Mancini is that Balotelli's waywardness could jeopardise City's title bid. The latest nocturnal excursion particularly angered Mancini because the player had been told the team would be depending on him to perform to his best against Bolton because both Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Edin Dzeko needed to rest after gruelling midweek international fixtures, whereas Balotelli was in theory able to relax at home after being omitted from the Italy squad. It is his thoughtlessness that exasperates Mancini most. \"I think he does this without malice,\" said Mancini. \"He doesn't think about the game in two days and doesn't think that we've had players playing for their national teams and that all week we prepared this game for him to play as striker because he would be freshest. I understand because he is only 21. But after 100 times I think he should understand what happens around him. Mario stayed on the bench for five or six games at the start of the season because his behaviour was not good. Many times he was in the stands for this reason.\" The player's latest indiscretion came just a day after Mancini said that he thought the player had finally seen the light and was now \"perfect off the pitch.\" Mancini pointed out, however, that \"I also said that with Mario anything can happen at any time.\" Yet he made it clear that he is not about to give up on the player. \"If you are not patient, you cannot do this job,\" he said. \"What Mario needs is time. When you are young you make mistakes and then comes a moment when you understand.\" Although he eventually scored against Bolton, tapping in from close-range after nimble work by Adam Johnson, Balotelli was guilty of missing a slew of chances before that. He was unlucky to hit the post from an acute angle in the fourth minute but should have done better from three subsequent one-on-ones, two of which were saved by Adam Bogdan and one that resulted in a wild shot over the bar. City, whose first goal was struck by Ga\u00ebl Clichy via a deflection off Gretar Steinsson, were so dominant and Bolton so impotent that Balotelli's profligacy did not matter on this occasion. Mancini knows, however, that in future it might, especially given that the manager anticipates City needing to win all of their remaining league games if they are to be champions for the first time since 1968. \"There are two months left and it will be very hard,\" he said. \"We know that if we are fighting against a top squad in United and if we want to stay at the top we have to win the next 10 games.\" Bolton's focus is on the other end of the table and with matches against three relegation rivals over the next month they are preparing for a mighty battle. \"We've got to win no matter what now,\" said their midfielder Darren Pratley. \"Owen Coyle's sides are known for good football but if you watch him on the sidelines he doesn't just want pretty football, he wants the lads to get stuck in. It's not as if he wants tippy-tappy stuff. We are going to have to dig in now, stay in the league, then kick on.\" Man of the match: Yaya Tour\u00e9 (Manchester City)",

      "bodyText": "Roberto Mart\u00ednez heads into his summit with the Wigan owner, Dave Whelan, on Monday insisting his maligned selection decisions in the defeat to Swansea were thrust upon him and that he has the knowhow to orchestrate a third straight Premier League great escape. Mart\u00ednez blamed the effects of the international friendly week for omitting leading triumvirate Victor Moses, Hugo Rodallega and Mohamed Diam\u00e9. A combination of them starting on the bench for such a crucial contest and the performance that followed led Whelan to vent his frustration on the Saturday teatime airwaves and seek an explanation face to face. \"There are reasons why we had Victor Moses on the bench,\" the Wigan manager said. \"He made his debut for Nigeria and had to travel to and from Rwanda and deal with all the emotions that come with the first time you represent your country. Lengthy journeys do take it out of you. If you have players arriving on Friday evening it is nearly impossible to prepare for a game. \"You tell me if that is a normal thing to do in one of the best leagues in world football: to have players arriving less than 24 hours before kick-off. That is not the right preparation. We probably got affected more than other dressing rooms in the league. That is not an excuse. But that is the situation. We didn't create it. \"At this level you need to be perfect in what you do. I don't think we could cope. It was the worst fixture for us after an international. Swansea keep the ball really well. You have to be fully fit.\" Whelan's ear is likely to be a sympathetic one despite his admission that he was \"downhearted and shellshocked\" by the worst Wigan display he had witnessed \"for four or five years\". Since Mart\u00ednez was prised from Swansea in the summer of 2009, the pair have enjoyed an excellent working relationship. Initially promised three years' grace in the job, the 38-year-old Spaniard deposited extra credit in the bank by snubbing Aston Villa's advances last June. \"Nobody is happy,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"The chairman is the reason why we are here. Every performance is for him. It wasn't good enough. It is all too easy to get really extreme with your emotions. When you win you think you are going to be unbeaten until the end of the season. Now I am sure everyone is really down.\" Wigan are without a home win in their last 12 matches, their worst sequence in 34 years as a Football/Premier League club, and this was a missed opportunity. Had they taken three points against a team who were the Premier League's second-worst travellers before kick off, it could have offered the double whammy of sucking Swansea into the relegation fight. However, despite overwhelming evidence that this will be one campaign too many for Wigan, Mart\u00ednez insists he can beat the odds once more. They were also bottom in the first week of March last year and survived. \"The football dream is part of my life. It is a passion. It is a privilege for me. I am desperate to get out next Sunday against Norwich. We have done it time after time,\" he said. Swansea secured only a third away win of the campaign with two outstanding long-range efforts in a nine-minute spell either side of the interval from Gylfi Sigurdsson, who is keen to return to England permanently when his loan from the German club Hoffenheim expires in the summer. \"I'm sure he will cost a lot of money. Whether we have that money or not is another factor,\" said the Swansea manager, Brendan Rodgers, who gave the midfielder his chance at Reading before his \u00a36m switch to the Bundesliga. \"It's probably not up to me as I've another two seasons left at Hoffenheim but I don't want to sit on the bench there for any longer. I did enough of that last year. I just want to play football and I am here, so I'm happy,\" Sigurdsson said. Even his substitution following Nathan Dyer's straight red on the hour could not wipe the smile from his face. Alan Tate, his replacement, also sported one, and for good reason. This was the defender's first action following a six-month lay-off with a broken leg incurred in a golf buggy accident. Man of the match: Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea)",

Arsenal can only pray their brilliant Dutchman wanted simply to record the day of his first goals against Liverpool and not historic English stadiums he may soon leave behind. It reflected Van Persie's stature in a season of 31 goals that he should have a major influence on the Champions League aspirations of two clubs on Saturday \u2013 pushing Arsenal closer to a 15th consecutive campaign among the European elite and Liverpool away from their main target for a third year. All around him, the task of persuading the striker to extend a contract with 15 months remaining continued. Alex Song played his part with the pass that enabled his captain to beat Jos\u00e9 Reina inside the near post with a glorious 92nd-minute volley, reprising their match-winning combination against Everton in the process. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger worked on the emotions with a tribute to Van Persie's \"exceptional development as a player and as a human being\". It will be a concerted effort that convinces the 28-year-old he can win the highest honours in an Arsenal shirt that will determine his future, however, and slowly, sometimes falteringly, Wenger's team are displaying the strength of character required. Arsenal have transformed their Premier League campaign between losing to Liverpool at the Emirates in August and inflicting the first home defeat on Kenny Dalglish's team this season. If only they could condense that recovery into 90 minutes against Milan on Tuesday. \"We want to make the impossible possible. That is basically our target,\" said Wenger, whose team trail 4-0 from the first leg. \"When we played Liverpool at the start of the season it was a bit of a shambles. We were in a bit of disarray because we had a full transfer period and we were unstable. We have since come back into a much better position and are much more solid. At the time we last played Liverpool we were 17th in the league so we had, first of all, room for improvement and I think we have improved a lot.\" In Van Persie and the goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, Arsenal had the two best players on the pitch. But not the better team. Liverpool dominated the first half in particular, exploiting the Arsenal midfield's failure to protect their defence with quick, direct passing to create chances almost at will. Once again they could not score, not even from a penalty for the sixth time this season \u2013 eight if you include the Carling Cup final shootout \u2013 when Szczesny tripped Luis Su\u00e1rez and saved the spot-kick and rebound from Dirk Kuyt. \"The manager said I move my feet too early at penalties and I end up losing a few inches by moving my feet earlier,\" revealed the 21-year-old keeper. \"So I said I am not going to move my feet and go as late as I can and it worked. He will try and get all the credit for that.\" Dalglish labelled the Liverpool performance \"outstanding\" and said only a \"wee bit of luck\" was missing as they hit the woodwork twice more. It was a familiar and inaccurate lament. A performance cannot be lauded when it repeatedly lacks the most important aspect. Kuyt apart, Liverpool had no one with conviction inside the Arsenal penalty area. On television afterwards Jamie Redknapp was among many of a Liverpool persuasion to ponder what Dalglish's team could achieve with Van Persie in attack. \"But those kind of players cost \u00a340m,\" said Redknapp, overlooking the fact Liverpool spent \u00a357.8m on two forwards 14 months ago. Su\u00e1rez and Andy Carroll have a combined total of nine league goals this season. Liverpool had Laurent Koscielny to thank for their goal when the Arsenal defender sliced Jordan Henderson's cross inside his own post, before Van Persie escaped Jamie Carragher too easily to headthe equaliser from Bacary Sagna's cross. His wonderful winner was only the third time in nine years that Liverpool have lost a league game at home having scored first. Every time to Arsenal. \"This club deserves to be in the Champions League. It is the least you can ask for. It is important for Robin but we all want to get there,\" added Szczesny, who empathised with Reina's inability to deal with Van Persie's excellence. \"We get bullied in training. I am not going to lie. It is quite embarrassing sometimes playing against him in training. As a goalkeeper sometimes there is just nothing that you can do. It is quite embarrassing but I think he has improved me as a goalkeeper.\"",

      "bodyText": "Dispatches from the frontline: Ryan Giggs's favourite Chinese meal is chilli lamb. There is a plate on the wall of Wing's restaurant in Manchester signed by Giggs, endorsing the dish. According to the owner Wing Shing Chu, the Manchester United veteran, despite his well-advertised preference for variety in the boudoir, orders the same thing on every visit. I am able to bring you this latest intelligence thanks to my subscription to MUTV. The many millions of you not similarly endowed may also wish to know that after Sir Alex Ferguson removes his chewing gum of an evening, he likes to get his laughing tackle around some soft noodles \u2013 you would have thought the word \"soft\" might deter him, but until they start serving \"well hard noodles\", that's what he gets \u2013 and Wayne Rooney's favoured starter is salt-and-pepper spare ribs. These latest revelations were in a programme called Red Dragons' Kitchen, one of countless shows on MUTV featuring United players in smart restaurants, the channel's favoured ballast, in between the lame-brained phone-ins and coverage of reserve matches. As it happens, I have eaten in Wing's and found it perfectly fine, if a little pretentious and overpriced, for food not vastly different from the cheap and cheerful places elsewhere in Manchester's Chinatown. Not that that would be a consideration for those earning bulging weekly envelopes in the bright, shiny world of Premier League football. Lower down the league ladder, things are different. If you were looking for a handy metaphor for the state of football below the Premier League, Blackpool v Hull City on Sky on Friday night would do. Blackpool took to the field in shirts carrying the name of their sponsor, Wonga.com, while Hull's bore that of Cash Converters; a loan firm versus a pawnbroker, more or less. Hard times. The fans' chants, echoing round a half-empty stadium (or half-full, if you are one of those people), Sky's Friday night second team, and a deal of banal football completed the picture. It was not much more festive at Leeds United on Saturday. The appointment of Neil Warnock means Leeds now have a charmless manager to go with their charmless chairman \u2013 which was obviously not the line being sold by Sky, who spoke to Warnock before the match. The new manager was able to reveal the previously well-kept secret that Ken Bates's heart \"is in the right place\", by which I assume he meant Monte Carlo. He also declared himself pleased with the way Leeds fans had taken to the Warnock-Bates axis, which is clearly not the whole picture. As someone living rather closer to Elland Road than the Principality of Monaco, I should say the fans' resistance has been so lowered by administration, points deductions, the sale of their best players, and various other indignities, that you could instal a regime of Pol Pot and Piers Morgan and they'd just shrug, and turn up as usual. Some of them would anyway. Sky pundit Gary McAllister's pre-match prediction of a full house, attracted by a match against the league leaders, and the \"two big egos\" now guiding Leeds, was way out. A crowd of 20,000 of the most tribal fans in the country tells me that in these difficult times, several thousand others are taking the line that, like Wing's, Bates might be charging rather too much for moderate fare. Still, if you have missed the cutaways of Warnock snarling in his technical area, berating the fourth official, and his post-match whingeing, you will welcome his return. \"I expect a referee and a linesman to spot a blatant handball,\" was his typical whinge after Leeds's defeat in a match they dominated. Others might say that Southampton had benefited from the eternal Championship truth that with a decent goalie, a well-drilled defence, and a reliable goalscorer, it is a league in which you will often get away with it. If Southampton's keeper Kelvin Davis was instrumental to the win at Leeds, his performance was eclipsed by the goalkeeping display of the season so far in the thrilling Liverpool\u2013Arsenal match on Saturday. But for Wojciech Szczesny in Arsenal's goal, Liverpool would undoubtedly have been out of sight by half\u2011time \u2013 gratefully acknowledged in post-match interviews by manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and goalscorer Robin van Persie. The cheerful Dutchman demonstrated his command of idiomatic English by graciously admitting \"we nicked it\", without losing sight of the footballer's sacred duty when faced with a post-match mic, to preface every observation with \"to be fair\". The three Championship matches over the weekend \u2013 the BBC televised Cardiff City v West Ham United on Sunday \u2013 were always going to look a little drab measured against another exciting and unlikely Arsenal comeback. BBC commentator Jonathan Pearce did try his hardest, though, to sell us Sunday's game, with some nonsense about the \"haunted eyes\" of the Cardiff players after defeat in the Carling Cup final, and the indispensable information that the last time West Ham won in Cardiff \"the nation was dancing to the No1 in the charts, Working My Way Back To You by the Detroit Spinners\". I'd drop the scripted intro if I were you, Jonathan. Finally, thanks to ITV sports journo Luke McLaughlin, writing in a personal capacity, who noted a rare appearance by Matt Le Tissier as Sky co-commentator for the Liverpool match. \"Le Tissier said 'he'll be disappointed with that' an awful lot,\" Luke tweeted me. \"He'll be disappointed with that.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2012 to emphasise that Luke McLaughlin was writing in a personal capacity.",

A crowd of 20,000 of the most tribal fans in the country tells me that in these difficult times, several thousand others are taking the line that, like Wing's, Bates might be charging rather too much for moderate fare.</p> <p>Still, if you have missed the cutaways of Warnock snarling in his technical area, berating the fourth official, and his post-match whingeing, you will welcome his return. \"I expect a referee and a linesman to spot a blatant handball,\" was his typical whinge after Leeds's defeat in a match they dominated. Others might say that Southampton had benefited from the eternal Championship truth that with a decent goalie, a well-drilled defence, and a reliable goalscorer, it is a league in which you will often get away with it.</p> <p>If Southampton's keeper Kelvin Davis was instrumental to the win at Leeds, his performance was eclipsed by the goalkeeping display of the season so far in the thrilling Liverpool\u2013Arsenal match on Saturday. But for Wojciech Szczesny in Arsenal's goal, Liverpool would undoubtedly have been out of sight by half\u2011time \u2013 gratefully acknowledged in post-match interviews by manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and goalscorer Robin van&#xa0;Persie. The cheerful Dutchman demonstrated his command of idiomatic English by graciously admitting \"we nicked it\", without losing sight of the footballer's sacred duty when faced with a post-match mic, to preface every observation with \"to be fair\".</p> <p>The three Championship matches over the weekend \u2013 the BBC televised Cardiff City v West Ham United on Sunday \u2013 were always going to look a little drab measured against another exciting and unlikely Arsenal comeback. BBC commentator Jonathan Pearce did try his hardest, though, to sell us Sunday's game, with some nonsense about the \"haunted eyes\" of the Cardiff players after defeat in the Carling Cup final, and the indispensable information that the last time West Ham won in Cardiff \"the nation was dancing to the No1 in the charts, Working My Way Back To You by the Detroit Spinners\". I'd drop the scripted intro if I were you, Jonathan.</p> <p>Finally, thanks to ITV sports journo Luke McLaughlin, writing in a personal capacity, who noted a rare appearance by Matt Le Tissier as Sky co-commentator for the Liverpool match. \"Le Tissier said 'he'll be disappointed with that' an awful lot,\" Luke tweeted me. \"He'll be disappointed with that.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2012 to emphasise that Luke McLaughlin was writing in a personal capacity.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two women hover over a ballot box in the industrial Russian city of Cherepovets, stuffing in ballot after ballot. On the streets of Moscow, an independent election monitor armed with an iPhone trails a van full of \"carousel\" voters \u2013 people bussed from polling site to polling site in order to cast multiple votes for Vladimir Putin. Three months after Moscow exploded in a storm of fury over allegedly widespread electoral fraud during the country's parliamentary vote, Russians went to the polls to vote against or, mostly, for Vladimir Putin in his quest to return to the presidency. Putin quickly claimed victory, waiting until just over 20% of votes were counted, but his opponents just as quickly cried foul, armed with reels of evidence of alleged fraud. They uploaded them by the thousands to their Twitter accounts and LiveJournal blogs, helping the indignation go viral. \"Russia has no legitimate government or legitimate president,\" opposition leader Alexey Navalny said, addressing press and supporters at a makeshift headquarters at a central Moscow cafe. \"He who has declared himself president is a usurper.\" The tension on the streets was palpable. Interior ministry troops, backed by army trucks, arrest vans and bomb sappers, flooded central Moscow. They stood, camouflaged, with their backs to the Kremlin, guarding its residents against some unknown threat. Outside, democracy \u00e0 la russe was being carried out in polling sites around the country. Millions turned up at ballot boxes set up in schools, academies and even grocery shops to fulfil their civic duty, despite the widespread belief that the result had been decided for them. Nadezhda Dvornikova, a 57-year-old pensioner, held her grandson by the hand as she walked the halls of Moscow's Polytechnical College. \"I voted for Putin,\" she said quietly. \"I trust him.\" When asked if she thought her vote would make a difference, she said: \"No, I don't trust the results.\" Then why vote? \"We were raised that way.\" Though \"democracy\" came to Russia only 20 years ago, elections were a regular feature of the Soviet system. There was no choice and no surprise, but Soviet citizens turned out again and again to cast a formal vote for a decision that was out of their hands. Few yesterday thought that system had changed. \"Everyone knows the result beforehand,\" said Vassily, a 27-year-old engineer. Vassily said he did not vote \"for\" anyone. \"I voted against Putin,\" he said, nominally casting his vote for Mikhail Prokhorov, the billionaire businessman who continues to battle claims that he is a Kremlin project to harness liberal anger against Putin's increasingly autocratic rule. It was as though Moscow had been turned into a giant film set, with everyone playing their role. Voting sites blasted out 1980s Russian pop music. Grandmothers set up tables selling discount sandwiches, chocolates and even woollen scarves. But the mood was far from joyous as voters trickled in, voting more often against something \u2013 Putin or chaos \u2013 than for a particular candidate. Few spoke; even fewer smiled. \"I think he'll bring stability,\" said Olga, a 49-year-old social worker, explaining her vote for Putin. \"I wouldn't wish a change of personnel on my biggest enemies.\" More than one Putin voter said they did not see any alternative. Not one expressed support for a particular policy or approach, or expressed hope for what a further six years of Putin could bring to their lives. The military presence in the city only added to the feeling of imminent threat. Putin has spent months warning his subjects that those protesting against his rule are merely agents of western-sponsored revolution. Nashi, a pro-Kremlin youth group formed in the wake of pro-democracy revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, was deployed in force in the evening to counter that supposed threat. Tens of thousands of its members gathered in wet snow outside the walls of the Kremlin and adjacent streets, cheering as they listened to Putin declare victory over his unidentified enemies. That was not the only role they were called on to play. One activist standing in front of two dozen buses carrying the names of various Russian towns told the Guardian he had been bussed in from outside Moscow to vote in the capital. Communist party candidate Gennady Zyuganov, who received around 17% of votes, told reporters after the polls closed that he will not recognize the election result, calling it \"illegitimate, unfair and intransparent\". His campaign chief, Ivan Melnikov, claimed authorities set up numerous additional polling stations and alleged that hundreds of thousands of voters cast ballots at the ones in Moscow alone in an apparent attempt to rig the vote. Billionaire candidate Mikhail Prokhorov said on Channel One television after the vote that authorities kept his observers away from some polling stations and were beaten on two occasions. Oksana Dmitriyeva, a Duma deputy from Just Russia party, tweeted that they were witnessing \"numerous cases of observers being expelled from polling stations\" across St. Petersburg just before the vote count. Mikhail, 28, who voted for the first time against Putin, casting his ballot instead for Zyuganov, said: \"Of course they won't be clean. The last election showed us everything.\" Natalya, a 49-year-old accountant, said: \"It's obvious that Putin will win.\" She would not say who she voted for, instead explaining that she \"voted against Putin\". \"Of course he'll win \u2013 but I wanted our leaders to know that not all of Moscow is for them, that we're not all empty.\" As the polls closed, opposition activists began to discuss the results, expected as they were. There were no gasps of surprise or even raised eyebrows as the numbers attested to Putin's first-round win. Some laughed. The mood was neither angry, nor downtrodden, nor particularly excited. The film script had run its course. The evening ended with a quote from Stanislav Govorukhin, Putin's campaign chief and, appropriately, one of Russia's most celebrated film directors. Speaking to the online news portal Gazeta.ru, he said: \"These were the cleanest elections in all of Russia's history.\"",

As if captured by the Spanish game, by the two giants forever condemned to confrontation, Chelsea may be about to take Jos\u00e9 Mourinho versus Pep Guardiola to another sphere. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas succeeded in following Mourinho into Porto but he could not succeed in following his legacy at Stamford Bridge. Picking up where Mourinho has left off has rarely been easy, so dominant has his presence been. So powerful is Mourinho's identification with success, so close his relationship with the dressing room, so complete his communion with fans, that a part of him always remained. He never forgot and nor did they. Rafa Ben\u00edtez found that at Internazionale; now Villas-Boas has found it at Chelsea. The man who is now Chelsea's ex-manager, their fifth in four and a half years spoke of the Special One this week. \"His is a presence ever felt in the club. The most successful part of this club's history is related to Jos\u00e9,\" he said. \"But the only place where Jos\u00e9's shadow is not lurking is Barcelona. It is everywhere else in the world. If you can train a manager to be the best in the world, everyone wants him.\" He had a point: Barcelona chose Pep Guardiola over Mourinho. Guardiola won everything. The following season Mourinho, by then at Inter, did the same. Two trebles in a row. Guardiola has failed to win just three of 16 trophies available to his team. Two of those three were denied him by Mourinho. He, meanwhile, denied Mourinho two of three trophies in his first season at Madrid and he has faced him 10 times, losing just once. Along the way, the conflict grew so great that a reconciliation in Catalonia is now impossible for the Portuguese. Even in times of success, there was something missing after Mourinho's departure from Chelsea and in some ways this remains his club. In part, because the nucleus of his team remains: that core that Villas-Boas found so difficult to circumvent. Grant, Scolari, Hiddink, Ancelotti. All came, none truly conquered. Not only have Chelsea missed him; he has missed them. On those occasions that he has spoken about foreign fields, he has spoken with warmth and affection about England. It has not always been about Stamford Bridge specifically; rather, his horizons have been broader. \"The Premier League,\" he said, \"is my passion.\" Put simply: he has not enjoyed Spain as much as he enjoyed England. Chelsea spoke to Ben\u00edtez's camp about him taking over, but the offer on the table would only have been to the end of the season, at which point they would think again and other managers would be on the market. Ben\u00edtez was not convinced. Nor, indeed, were Chelsea's supporters. Those European clashes weigh heavily; trenches previously occupied are not easily vacated. Timing is everything and it could prove propitious for Mourinho. La Liga is likely to be Madrid's now, wrested from Barcelona for the first time in four years. Mourinho can depart a winner, another record notched up \u2013 league title winner in Spain as he was in Portugal, England and Italy. There is still the European Cup to come too: Mourinho is acutely aware that lifting the trophy with a third club would be unique, his place in history assured. Achieve that and his work here will be done. If Guardiola was to do so, it would be three in five years, Barcelona would become the only club to retain the Champions League in its expanded form. Mourinho has consistently refused to comment on his future. Others have sent messages for him. The message has been clear: Jos\u00e9 wants to come \"home\". Chelsea are not the only club that offer an English return, but there is attraction in sorting out the superficial mess left by his former friend and now rival. Few others will have the ability to handle the generational change needed \u2013 among those who must have their careers prolonged or brought to a close are some of Mourinho's most loyal players. From Chelsea's point of view, there are few apparent candidates. If Ben\u00edtez was a serious long-term option, he would already be in place. Guus Hiddink took up employment elsewhere. Fabio Capello has hardly seen his reputation enhanced with England, although his support of John Terry would make his landing smoother. If he was an option, though, why not now? As for Guardiola, Roman Abramovich has tried before to import Barcelona, while the Spaniard's delay in signing a contract extension at the Camp Nou gives Chelsea some hope. Guardiola's messages have been very different from Mourinho's, though: his actions have felt more like those of a man withdrawing from the spotlight not leaping back into it. Spanish football has boasted of the greatest rivalry in sport, often reduced to its key players, handy representatives of differing identities and different approaches: Madrid v Bar\u00e7a, Ronaldo v Messi, Mourinho v Guardiola.

      "bodyText": "Misdirection is a terrible problem for punters in the days leading up to a major race meeting, when the attention of the media begins to focus on particular, narrow issues. You may have the right answer to the question that everyone is asking and still lose your money if it isn't, in fact, the most important question, and it strikes me that we are close to forgetting the critical issue about next week's biggest name, Kauto Star. At the moment, all of racing seems to have its breath held, waiting for a final decision as to whether or not the Paul Nicholls-trained chaser will turn up for the Cheltenham Gold Cup a week on Friday. The omens, initially unpromising, now appear much more favourable, with Nicholls reporting that \"all was fine\" after the horse did a 10-furlong canter on Sunday. There will be daily updates this week as Kauto Star continues to recover from injuries sustained in a schooling fall 10 days ago. Resolution may be postponed until Saturday, when he is due to take part in what Nicholls calls \"a good, strong piece of work\" with Big Buck's. If he is sufficiently convincing, he will take part in the Gold Cup for the sixth consecutive year. The betting market seems to expect good news, as the horse's odds for the race were just over 9-2 on Sunday night on the Betfair betting exchange. That is just one point bigger than he was before we heard of his tumble last Thursday and a lot shorter than the 10-1 he reached as punters reacted to the breaking story. If Nicholls eventually sounds the all-clear signal this coming weekend, followers of the sport will let out a huge sigh of relief. It will seem that Kauto Star has cleared the biggest obstacle in his path. The detail which may have been lost in all the fuss over his wellbeing is his age. Kauto Star is 12, making him two years older than any Gold Cup winner since 1969. Even horses as old as 10 have a weak record in the race; the last to be successful was Cool Dawn in 1998. I am indebted to Paul Jones, trends nut and author of a superb annual betting guide to the Festival, for the following statistic. In the last 12 runnings of the Gold Cup, 59 horses aged 10 or older have been beaten, including four outright favourites. One of those older horses, of course, was the 11-year-old Kauto Star, beaten 11 lengths in last year's race by the six-year-old Long Run. This sort of thing can get trends-followers a bad name, of course. There is absolutely no question about Kauto Star's right to be in the Gold Cup and, as the winner of the Betfair and the King George this winter, he would go there as the horse with easily the best form. But the King George, over a shorter distance on a flat track, is not quite the test that the Gold Cup always is, and Kauto Star's record at Kempton, where it is run, is much better than his record at Cheltenham. Though he has won two Gold Cups, he failed to win three others and he has twice taken shocking falls at the Festival. I say this not to undermine him. He is a rival to Desert Orchid as the best steeplechaser of my lifetime and has proved a marvel of durability. Very few chasers retain their best form for more than a year but he won his first Grade One in 2005. The point is to underline what an astonishing thing he will be achieving if he manages to win the big race again next week. It will not just be about his recovery from a setback. Because of his age, it will be a feat that runs so much against the race's history that we might have to regard him as the best there has ever been.",

After last month's defeat at Newcastle United, the winger said in a swiftly-deleted tweet that, for the first time in his career, he was not enjoying playing. It endeared him to neither his manager, Alex McLeish, nor much of the fanbase, even if it suggested he shared the supporters' sentiments about a joyless brand of football and a season of underachievement. Yet as the Frenchman recaptured a little of his joie de vivre to provide Villa with much-needed spark, the dissent in the stands disappeared. After the mutiny at Wigan last week came a bounty at Blackburn Rovers as the \u00a310m summer signing scored and sparkled. \"He is finally starting to show what he's all about,\" said his captain, Stilian Petrov. \"It has been frustrating for him. Maybe it took him longer to settle down but he is a good lad, great to have around.\" The Bulgarian has taken on the job of imbuing a seemingly cocky character with confidence. \"We believe in Charles,\" he added. \"Every player goes through a bad period and that's why we are team-mates who support each other.\" His manager has long appreciated N'Zogbia's ability \u2013 McLeish tried to recruit him for Birmingham City in 2010 \u2013 but had appeared unsure how to deploy his biggest buy. At times, flair player became fringe player. But, though McLeish is adamant he never forced his charges to don it, the straitjacket was removed as the imaginative pair of N'Zogbia and Stephen Ireland were recalled. \"The players expressed themselves in the first half, which is what I've asked them to do since day one,\" the Scot insisted. The change in mood was epitomised by Carlos Cu\u00e9llar, who provided an impromptu Gerard Piqu\u00e9 impression by sauntering out of defence to set up N'Zogbia's goal. The disappointment for Villa was that their early excellence did not produce a game-clinching second. Short of specialist strikers, McLeish is now asking others to compensate. \"Now Charles and Stevie have to score goals,\" he said. Rather than the mistrusted mavericks they have seemed, the inventive duo have been urged to become stalwarts of the side. \"Stevie and Charles have to take more responsibility now that [Richard] Dunne is missing and [Darren] Bent is injured,\" McLeish said. The significance of senior players was a shared theory. His Blackburn counterpart, Steve Kean, was spared a 10th home defeat of the season by one of his backroom team. \"David Dunn's a player-stroke-staff member,\" said Kean. \"We feel that when he stops playing, which we hope will be many years away, he will still be a coach at the club.\" The 32-year-old's current job is to help preserve Blackburn's Premier League status; his headed equaliser was a start, with the veteran adding nous to an inexperienced side. \"We are probably the youngest team in the league,\" Kean said. Their youth has been emphasised by the departures of the club captain, Ryan Nelsen, and then the match-day captain, Christopher Samba, in quick succession. The armband has been inherited by Paul Robinson, who led from the back with several outstanding saves, but Dunn has been tasked with being his manager's voice on the field. \"He can almost be a player-coach on the pitch,\" Kean added.",

      "bodyText": "Child poverty campaigners will call on the government on Monday to postpone changes to working tax credits following research showing the cuts will leave some people worse off than if they gave up work and only claimed benefits. The chancellor is being urged to act before the 21 March budget after he raised the tax credits threshold for families with children from 16 hours to 24 hours work a week, a change due to take place in early April. In reply to a question from Labour MP Ann Coffey, the employment minister, Chris Grayling, admitted that couples with children that would no longer qualify for the extra money could see their income drop to \u00a3257 a week \u2013 \u00a314 a week less than an equivalent family with no adult working. Campaigners say many of the 212,000 couples claiming the credit but working under 24 hours a week say they cannot find more work, and claim it is unfair to penalise them for working. They are asking Osborne to delay the changes until autumn 2013, when a new universal benefits system will address the gap. \"It would be reckless to carry on regardless with a policy that puts 470,000 children at risk of being plunged into poverty,\" said Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, who signed the letter to George Osborne along with senior figures from Barnardo's, Citizens Advice and the union Usdaw. Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor also highlighted the problem. \"Tax credits were introduced to help make work pay,\" he said. \"This unfair and damaging change will mean thousands of families will lose \u00a373 a week and will be better off if they quit work. That cannot be right.\" Earlier, Balls suggested that Labour would not make a big issue if Osborne cut the top 50p tax rate, saying no tax was \"set in stone\". Speaking on Sky News's Murnaghan programme, he added: \"If, in the coming years, we can move on that as a country, fine. But do we really think families on \u00a3150,000 plus are the first priority?\" Jeremy Browne, the Lib Dem Foreign Office minister, also suggested that his party was giving ground on Tory pressure to cut the top rate 50p tax rate for people earning over \u00a3150,000, saying neither party were \"intellectually wedded\" to the idea of a 50p income tax rate and the chancellor would make the decision on when or if the top rate would go. He said: \"As and when it becomes possible to look at what we do to tax rates, then changes may be made but that's not the priority of the government.\" However in a clear signal that Lib Dems were not giving up something for nothing, he said the party's \"no 1 tax priority\" remained lifting the threshold at which people start paying tax to \u00a310,000, something the Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has taken the unusual position of supporting in public before the budget. The party also wants any abolition of the 50p tax replaced with a 1% annual \"mansion tax\" on homes worth more than \u00a32m. Balls also expressed support for proposals under discussion by the coalition, including speeding up efforts to raise the \u00a310,000 personal tax threshold, and the mansion tax. \"I think the VAT cut is the best but I think a personal allowance rise, a cut in fuel duty, those things would make sense,\" he said. \"Osborne and Nick Clegg seem to be saying, they are telling the newspapers, if they can find a way to make the mansion tax work \u2013 in the past I've supported that \u2013 if George Osborne can make a mansion tax work on multi-million pound properties, fine.\" But Boris Johnson, London's mayor, appeared to criticise the mansion tax \u2013 a levy which would be heavily concentrated on homes in the capital. \"I would much rather we stop focusing so much on bashing people and start looking at what we can do to help people into work,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme. \"I want massive investment in infrastructure, help for young people to get into work and I want a crackdown on tax dodgers and tax avoiders of all kinds.\" A scheme of selling properties through offshore companies to avoid stamp duty was a \"scandal\", said Johnson, who is standing for re-election against Ken Livingstone, the former London mayor. He also said upgrades to the 150-year-old tube network were vital to prevent future problems.",

      "body": "<p>Child poverty campaigners will call on the government on Monday to postpone changes to working tax credits following research showing the cuts will leave some people worse off than if they gave up work and only claimed benefits.</p> <p>The chancellor is being urged to act before the 21 March budget after he raised the tax credits threshold for families with children from 16&#xa0;hours to 24&#xa0;hours work a week, a change due to take place in early April. In reply to a question from Labour MP Ann Coffey, the employment minister, Chris Grayling, admitted that couples with children that would no longer qualify for the extra money could see their income drop to \u00a3257 a week \u2013 \u00a314 a week less than an equivalent family with no adult working.</p> <p>Campaigners say many of the 212,000 couples claiming the credit but working under 24 hours a week say they cannot find more work, and claim it is unfair to penalise them for working. They are asking Osborne to delay the changes until autumn 2013, when a new universal benefits system will address the gap.</p> <p>\"It would be reckless to carry on regardless with a policy that puts 470,000 children at risk of being plunged into poverty,\" said Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, who signed the letter to George Osborne along with senior figures from Barnardo's, Citizens Advice and the union Usdaw.</p> <p>Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor also highlighted the problem. \"Tax credits were introduced to help make work pay,\" he said. \"This unfair and damaging change will mean thousands of families will lose \u00a373 a week and will be better off if they quit work. That cannot be right.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Balls suggested that Labour would not make a big issue if Osborne cut the top 50p tax rate, saying no tax was \"set in stone\".

      "bodyText": "Chelsea will approach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola about taking over at Stamford Bridge in the summer as the club begin their search for a replacement for Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, who was sacked yesterday after 256 days in charge. Villas-Boas was dismissed within 24 hours of his side's Premier League defeat at West Bromwich Albion after being summoned to a meeting at the club's training ground by Roman Abramovich, the director Eugene Tenenbaum and the chief executive, Ron Gourlay. The 34-year-old took training in the morning with a shadow squad of those who had not featured at The Hawthorns, and was left bitterly disappointed by the news, having believed until recently that he would be allowed to see through a three-year \"project\" aimed at overhauling the club. He departs eight months and 40 games into a \u00a34.5m-a-year contract and is now technically on gardening leave, with Internazionale expected to sound him out as a successor to Claudio Ranieri at San Siro. The first-team fitness coach, Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Rocha, and Daniel Sousa, the head opposition scout, are also expected to leave. The assistant first-team coach, Roberto Di Matteo, will oversee the side for the rest of the season. The former West Bromwich manager's first game in charge will be against Birmingham City on Tuesday in an FA Cup fifth-round replay at St Andrew's. The Italian, who is out of contract in the summer, could yet be joined on the coaching staff by his compatriot, Gianfranco Zola, on a short-term basis with Chelsea having opted against offering Rafael Ben\u00edtez an 18-month contract to take up the reins. Instead, Di Matteo's involvement will now buy the Chelsea hierarchy time to identify a sixth permanent manager in five years, a process that will include exploring the possible availability of either Guardiola or Mourinho, who could both depart Spain in the summer. Guardiola has yet to agree a contract extension at Bar\u00e7a and remains Abramovich's dream appointment, though whether he would be prepared to move to London and work at a club who have proved so trigger-happy with its coaching staff remains to be seen. The possibility of Mourinho returning to Stamford Bridge, where he claimed two Premier League titles, two League Cups and an FA Cup during a glittering if fractious three-season spell, would galvanise the support. The Real Madrid manager, who has led his team clear at the top of La Liga this term, has declared his intention to return to the Premier League and was photographed last week looking at properties in London. However, while his relationship with Abramovich has improved in recent years, he is likely to seek assurances he would be granted complete control on footballing matters, including transfer policy, if he is to return. Whether the owner would grant him that leeway is open to question, with Chelsea now left to count the cost of another failed regime. A fee of \u00a313.3m had been paid to Porto to secure Villas-Boas's services last summer, an amount that took the compensation outlay on managers fired or hired to a staggering \u00a364m in a little over four years. While recent results had made Villas-Boas's departure inevitable, with Chelsea fifth in the league and three points outside the Champions League qualification places, there is intense frustration among the hierarchy at the part the players appeared to play in the manager's downfall. Abramovich, Tenenbaum and Gourlay were joined by the technical director, Michael Emenalo, in addressing the first-team squad in one of the changing rooms on Sunday, when their dissatisfaction with the squad's performances were made clear. Those present were warned in no uncertain terms to step up their efforts to rescue the current campaign after mustering only five wins in 16 matches, with the owner \u2013 who had personally recruited Villas-Boas last summer \u2013 indicating he holds them as responsible as the manager for a disappointing season. The recognition that the squad needs to be overhauled remains, with senior players, many of whom were resistant to Villas-Boas's attempts to reduce their involvement in the side, still expected to depart in the summer. The midfielder Juan Mata posted a message on his Facebook page, saying: \"It hasn't been an easy day for those who, like me, are part of Chelsea. I would like to thank the manager and wish him luck. We have to keep working hard and better days will come. Thanks for your support!\" Villas-Boas did not attend that meeting but did linger at the training ground to bid farewell to staff and some of the players. The anaemic manner of Saturday's 1-0 defeat at The Hawthorns convinced the hierarchy that radical action was required now if fourth place was still to be claimed. \"The board would like to record our gratitude for his work and express our disappointment that the relationship has ended so early,\" read a Chelsea statement. \"Unfortunately the results and performances of the team have not been good enough and were showing no signs of improving at a key time in the season.\"",

      "bodyText": "If David Cameron had been watching Ukip's spring conference on the Skegness seafront, the critic who would most have spoiled his day was not Roger Helmer MEP, the serial rebel who celebrated his weekend defection from the Tories by calling the prime minister a \"complete sell-out\" over Europe. Nor was it veteran Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom, who later dismissed him as \"an appallingly vacuous, pigeon-chested young man\". Helmer is 68, Bloom is 62, and they have been insulting the Tory leadership from the fleshpots of Strasbourg for years. They delight the equally elderly members of the UK Independence party, Britain's version of America's disaffected Tea Party. Stubborn, nostalgic and cheerfully insular, they are also very cross. No, the new Tory defector whose scornful tone might have rattled Cameron was Alexandra Swann. Smartly dressed and well-spoken, sporting long blonde hair and 3in heels, she does not fit the Ukip stereotype. No blazer and regimental tie, no beard or beer gut, Swann is researching a PhD on 19th century social Darwinism and the small state. She is also 23, a political anorak since 16, former deputy chairman of the Tory youth wing and a visible blogosphere presence. As sunshine finally burned off overnight fog on nearby Skegness beach, Swann was cheered by 400 Ukip activists in the Embassy theatre for her assessment that Cameron's \"Lib Dem-led business-hating coalition\" \u2013 obsessed with Europe and windfarms \u2013 is already on the ropes. So many people at the SW Surrey Conservative club (her tax-hating father is a member) feel betrayed by Cameron (\"as true a Conservative as Belgium is a real country\") that they will soon be following her into Ukip, she assured them. All parties love defectors, the lifeblood of political hope. But Ukip leader Nigel Farage MEP (\"the first politician to be given the freedom of the City of London\"), believes this time is different. Given a rock star's welcome in Skeg on Saturday, he combined mockery of familiar Brussels targets such as EU president Herman van Rompuy with a renewed effort to broaden Ukip's appeal as the \"commonsense\" party of liberty within the democratic nation state. \"We want to be good Europeans, but we don't want to be run by people like [Jos\u00e9 Manuel] Barroso or Van Rompuy. We want a Europe of nation states,\" he said, where small employers and the self-employed, \"heroes\" ground down by bureaucracy, can smoke in their own pub or go fox-hunting if they want, he explained. More and more young libertarians like Swann share his view, say party officials. The Guardian encounters an earnest 15-year-old who has made the journey from London and is on message: \"The other parties are all the same. Only Ukip can save us.\" Like most party conferences, Ukip's looks more middle class and middle-aged than young, though there is plenty of talk of restoring grammar school opportunities for the working class (\"To get my kids the education I got I had to pay,\" says newspaper columnist Jon Gaunt) and a top tier of distinctly posh. It includes peers and academics such as economist Tim (\"leave the EU and join the world\") Congdon and educationalist Sir Chris Woodhead. He praises Ukip as the only party with \"conviction, common sense and courage\". It is two years since the eurozone crisis first vindicated some of Ukip's predictions, almost two years after Cameron's failure to win a Commons majority forced the Tories into coalition with the pro-euro Liberal Democrats. It is nearly three years since Ukip beat Brown-led Labour into third place in the 2009 European elections. With Labour worth barely a rude mention on Saturday, Ukip's leadership thinks its breakthrough into Westminster politics may be at hand. That may be a tall order. In the 2010 general election Ukip got 919,417 votes to the Tories' 10,703,654, 8,606,517 for Labour, 6,836,248 for the Lib Dems \u2013 and 564,321 for the BNP, which Ukip dismisses as a leftwing party of extremists, so unlike itself. Ukip may have 12 MEPS but it has no MPs. At local level it boasts just 139 councillors, mostly in parishes, 21 at district level and \u2013 in Cambridgeshire county, Huntingdon district and Ramsey parish councillor, the highly articulate Peter Reeve \u2013 all three. Ramsey got international media attention when the controlling Ukip group decided to save money by cleaning the parish loos themselves \u2013 typical of its hand-on, localist worldview, says Reeve. How can Britain afford to pay Europe \u00a350m a day, send aid to nuclear India and waste money on bureaucracy when it cuts buses and care for the elderly, leaving potholes in the roads, he asks. Loud applause. Skegness's famous skipping mascot, the whiskery Jolly Fisherman, is deployed on conference literature and looks the Ukip type \u2013 jolly in a saloon bar way, but cross about quite a lot. The party's strength is in small towns and rural communities, its attraction in Lincolnshire enhanced by hostility to migrant farm workers. Chris Pain, Ukip's local candidate in 2010, tells the conference the workers undercut local wages, wire most of their pay home to Poland on Fridays and avoid UK taxes. More applause. The populist politics of grievance are not confined to Ukip, which shares with bigger parties a desire to cut taxes and the state while proposing all sorts of costly plans \u2013 like more bobbies on the beat \u2013 and wants a more efficient military that buys off-the-shelf Apache helicopters, not customised ones at five times the price. A visceral scorn for the EU as the whipping boy for life's problems is what holds Ukip-ers together, but its agenda is widening. Farage, 47, a former City broker turned MEP since 1999, and his executive chairman, Steve Crowther, a marketing man, know they must avoid the extremist and one-policy labels and reach out. There is little or no mention of China, India or even Germany, nor of larger economic or social forces at work. The tone is insular \u2013 and proud of it. But Ukip is aware of one looming irony. For a party with its raison d'etre it knows that Alex Salmond's campaign to break up the UK must be a growing priority. On the conference fringe in Skeg the most heated debate was between those who advocate an England-only parliament to match the devolved assemblies, end the English backlash and save the union \u2013 and those who argued fiercely that such a strategy will \"do Barroso's job for him\" by breaking up Britain. Europe, it's everywhere.",

We want a Europe of nation states,\" he said, where small employers and the self-employed, \"heroes\" ground down by bureaucracy, can smoke in their own pub or go fox-hunting if they want, he explained.</p> <p>More and more young libertarians like Swann share his view, say party officials.

      "bodyText": "The Department of Health said it had \"every confidence\" in the head of the body that polices competition in the NHS after concerns were raised that he also runs one of the UK's biggest healthcare companies. Scrutiny of the role played by Lord Carter as chairman of the NHS Co-operation and Competition Panel (CCP) comes at a particularly sensitive time for the government as it faces growing opposition to its healthcare reforms, which would usher in a big expansion of private competition. It is also embarrassing for Labour, which elevated Lord Carter of Coles to the House of Lords under prime minister Tony Blair, and is now leading the political opposition to the health and social care bill, and in particular what it regards as creeping privatisation. There is no suggestion that Carter has done anything wrong. His role as UK chairman of US-owned healthcare giant McKesson and other companies was well known when he was appointed to chair the CCP, and all jobs are clearly recorded on his parliamentary profile. On its website, US-owned McKesson says it has contracts with more than 90% of NHS organisations, as well as with other private health companies. However, it is likely to cause further concern about companies that are seen to benefit from a widespread programme of private involvement in public services. There have been calls for more investigation into how much private consultants advising government on the controversial health reforms stand to make from the changes. Under proposals in the health and social care bill going through parliament, the CCP is due to be merged with another regulatory body, Monitor, which will oversee what is expected to be a huge expansion of private sector companies in the NHS. Reacting to Carter's dual roles, Dr Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: \"He cannot have any credibility when he is also heading a company with such huge interests in the very contracts his organisation is meant to police. GPs are being minutely scrutinised for possible conflicts of interest. But if we are going to have to have transparency, it has to apply throughout the system.\" The Department of Health defended the peer's dual roles, in a statement that said: \"We do not believe there is any evidence of a conflict of interest. Since the CCP was established, they have done an excellent job in helping to ensure good procurement practice and fair competition, and we continue to have every confidence in Lord Carter.\" In a separate statement, McKesson said: \"Lord Carter steps down from any investigation where there is potential conflict of interest. Lord Carter was appointed for his experience in this area. It is also worth noting that the CCP only has an advisory role in making recommendations to either the DoH or Monitor. The CCP has a track record of making objective assessments.\" The company also stressed that the scope for conflict of interest was \"limited\" because CCP was in charge of patient services and had no remit over the IT contracts in which McKesson specialises. McKesson has operated in the UK since 1990, employs 450 staff in the UK, and boasts that its NHS HR and payroll IT system is the world's largest.",

      "bodyText": "Sunday night was Vladimir Putin's Brezhnev moment. It was when he ceased simply being an elected leader and segued towards a lifetime presidency. Having neatly sidestepped the rules by doing a stint as prime minister (no Russian leader can serve more than two consecutive presidential terms) Putin can now go on and on. Brezhnev did 18 years, Stalin 31. Despite the whispers of revolution lapping at the Kremlin's walls, who would bet against Vladimir matching Leonid? The election \u2013 more of a coronation, really \u2013 differed from previous Russian polls in one respect. After the public outrage that followed last December's rigged parliamentary poll in Russia, Putin ordered that live web cameras be fitted in each of the country's 91,000 polling stations. Over the past 48 hours, these cameras have reproduced a fascinating slice of Russian provincial life. We have seen cleaners mopping the floors of sports-halls, election officials dozing on the job, even a jolly Saturday evening disco at a polling station in sub-zero Siberia. Chekhov, that great chronicler of the ordinary, would have cheered. But the cameras didn't do what, superficially at least, they were \"intended\" to do. They didn't stop the fraud. Opposition activists have posted video footage of a host of electoral violations including ballot-box stuffing and paid supporters of Putin being ferried around in an armada of buses to vote in multiple locations. Nor did the cameras catch election officials who fudged totals once polls had closed \u2013 the most common form of fraud in December. For a long time now, \"elections\" in Russia's ritualised imitation democracy have lacked one crucial element: drama. This was no different. Since he announced last autumn that he was standing for a third time to be president \u2013 taking his chair back from Dmitry Medvedev \u2013 Putin's victory was a foregone conclusion. It was achieved against a bunch of uninspiring hand-picked opponents, with the invincible advantage of 24-hour pro-Putin state television. There was never any doubt about the result. But the Putin who returns to the Kremlin in May faces a radically different Russia from the quiescent one he has ruled for the past 12 years. Although he still enjoys support in the provinces, for the protesters who will gather on Monday in their tens of thousands in Moscow's Pushkin Square he has become a figure of loathing and derision. (A recent protest video compares him to Montgomery Burns, the ageing greedy miser from the Simpsons) Putin is well aware that the protests now shaking Russia are the most serious since perestroika. They are spearheaded by a sophisticated urban middle class, but they include all kinds of Russians fed up with the falsehoods, feudal condescension and galactic thieving that have characterised his regime. The demonstrators don't agree on who should replace Russia's Duracell leader. But they are united in their desire to get rid of him. Confronted with the spectre of an Orange Revolution, Putin has two options. He can try to assuage the demonstrators with the vague promise of liberal reforms, or he can use the same lugubriously repressive KGB tactics that have served on previous occasions: black PR against key opposition figures; arrests; and the perennial libel that his enemies are traitorous western stooges and US-backed \"fifth columnists\". Putin appears inclined towards the second, more thuggish, option. The Kremlin has sent hundreds of riot police and grey army vans to encircle Red Square. It's hard to know if he really believes Hillary Clinton is paying the demonstrators, as he has claimed. Does he really believe the crowds will seize the Kremlin? But in recent months he has slipped further away from reality. Putin's worldview has always been one of anti-Americanism and chippy Soviet xenophobia. For the west, Putin's return means that Moscow will once again be a tricky and often paranoid partner. Only in the job for a few weeks, the US's new ambassador in Moscow, Michael McFaul, has been on the receiving end of a nasty Kremlin smear campaign. The Kremlin has deployed one of its favoured tricks \u2013 creating a fake \"McFaul\" Twitter account, using an upper-case i as an l. With Putin back on the international stage, the \"reset\" between Barack Obama's Washington and Medvedev's Moscow will go straight in the dustbin. Relations between Britain and Russia are also in for a bumpy ride. This autumn, an inquest will be held into the 2006 murder of Alexander Litvinenko. Scotland Yard's evidence will be presented in public for the first time \u2013 almost certainly confirming that Litvinenko was the victim of a state-sponsored assassination, sanctioned at the top levels of Russian power. Putin \u2013 president again, and inclined to see conspiracy in everything \u2013 won't like this much. But, he says, he'll still come to the London Olympics. At home, Putin has failed to explain why he wants to stay in power for another six years, with the option of another six in 2018. In the absence of any fresh leadership, Russia faces a period of stagnation, frustration and emigration \u2013 similar to Brezhnev's Soviet Union. In international relations, it will continue to play a spoiling role, weighing up its own strategic interests against the frisson of annoying the Americans. Many of the best and brightest Russians will leave. Especially if the protests fail to deliver any tangible political change. For those demonstrating on Monday on Pushkin Square, the difficulty is this: how to bring about the end of the regime? There is no easy answer. Putin has no desire to step down. And given the personalist nature of the system he has created there isn't anybody who can make him. Moreover, Putin understands only too well the logic of the corrupt government model he has created. Any real successor would probably seize his assets, which total billions of dollars, and put him in a jail cell. Russian politics, then, is entering a period of uncertainty. But we can assume for now that Putin will carry on, as will those who oppose him.",

(A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzGo4c6U8os&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">recent protest video compares him to Montgomery Burns, the ageing greedy miser from the Simpsons</a>)</p> <p>Putin is well aware that the protests now shaking Russia are the most serious since perestroika. They are spearheaded by a sophisticated urban middle class, but they include all kinds of Russians fed up with the falsehoods, feudal condescension and galactic thieving that have characterised his regime.</p> <p>The demonstrators don't agree on who should replace Russia's Duracell leader. But they are united in their desire to get rid of him.</p> <p>Confronted with the spectre of an Orange Revolution, Putin has two options. He can try to assuage the demonstrators with the vague promise of liberal reforms, or he can use the same lugubriously repressive KGB tactics that have served on previous occasions: black PR against key opposition figures; arrests; and the perennial libel that his enemies are traitorous western stooges and US-backed \"fifth columnists\".</p> <p>Putin appears inclined towards the second, more thuggish, option. The Kremlin has sent hundreds of riot police and<a href=\"http://www.ridus.ru/news/24381/\" title=\"\"> grey army vans to encircle Red Square</a>. It's hard to know if he really believes Hillary Clinton is paying the demonstrators, as he has claimed. Does he really believe the crowds will seize the Kremlin? But in recent months he has slipped further away from reality. Putin's worldview has always been one of anti-Americanism and chippy Soviet xenophobia.</p> <p>For the west, Putin's return means that Moscow will once again be a tricky and often paranoid partner. Only in the job for a few weeks, the US's new ambassador in Moscow, Michael McFaul, has been on the receiving end of a nasty Kremlin smear campaign. The Kremlin has deployed one of its favoured tricks \u2013 creating a fake \"McFaul\" Twitter account, using an upper-case i as an l. With Putin back on the international stage, the \"reset\" between Barack Obama's Washington and Medvedev's Moscow will go straight in the dustbin.</p> <p>Relations between Britain and Russia are also in for a bumpy ride. This autumn, an inquest will be held into the 2006 murder of Alexander Litvinenko. Scotland Yard's evidence will be presented in public for the first time \u2013 almost certainly confirming that Litvinenko was the victim of a state-sponsored assassination, sanctioned at the top levels of Russian power. Putin \u2013 president again, and inclined to see conspiracy in everything \u2013 won't like this much. But, he says, he'll still come to the London Olympics.</p> <p>At home, Putin has failed to explain why he wants to stay in power for another six years, with the option of another six in 2018. In the absence of any fresh leadership, Russia faces a period of stagnation, frustration and emigration \u2013 similar to Brezhnev's Soviet Union. In international relations, it will continue to play a spoiling role, weighing up its own strategic interests against the frisson of annoying the Americans. Many of the best and brightest Russians will leave. Especially if the protests fail to deliver any tangible political change.</p> <p>For those demonstrating on Monday on Pushkin Square, the difficulty is this: how to bring about the end of the regime? There is no easy answer. Putin has no desire to step down. And given the personalist nature of the system he has created there isn't anybody who can make him. Moreover, Putin understands only too well the logic of the corrupt government model he has created. Any real successor would probably seize his assets, which total billions of dollars, and put him in a jail cell.</p> <p>Russian politics, then, is entering a period of uncertainty. But we can assume for now that Putin will carry on, as will those who oppose him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unlikely as it may seem, Rebecca Adlington has rarely been so nervous at the start of a race or as happy at the finish as she was for the 400m freestyle on Sunday night. For four years Adlington has been dreaming about competing in front of her home crowd at the London Olympics. Now she has secured a place in the 400m at least, and the Games are so close she can almost taste them. Adlington won the event at the British Championships, finishing well ahead of her friend and rival Jo Jackson. The two-time Olympic champion from 2008's time of 4min 2.35sec was the fastest in the world this year, but she did not think twice about that. All that mattered was that she had won selection, and her joy and satisfaction showed in the broad smile she wore on her face. Ellen Gandy was no less elated when she won the 100m butterfly, breaking the British record as she did it. Her time of 57.25sec was 0.15 quicker than the old mark, set in 2010 by Halsall, who finished in second and also took the second spot on the Olympic team. Her lifelong friend Jemma Lowe, who finished seventh in the event at the World Championships in Shanghai last year, missed the cut. \"It's the biggest meet of all our lives,\" Adlington said, with irrepressible enthusiasm. \"I am feeling so much relief, happiness, excitement \u2013 it's just an amazing feeling. I wanted this so badly. London has always been my target, and to actually finally know that I am going is the best feeling in the world.\" Gandy agreed. \"It's the greatest feeling ever,\" she added. \"All I've wanted to do for the last four years is just be able to say: 'I'm going to the London Olympic Games', and now I can say it.\" There is so much at stake here in the days until Saturday, with even swimmers of Gandy and Adlington's calibre terrified by the idea that they might miss out on Olympic selection. Great Britain have real strength in depth in both the freestyle and the butterfly, so neither had the comfort of feeling like qualification was a given. Adlington was stricken with nerves before her final, wobbling on the blocks as she waited for the gun. Jackson who won the bronze behind Adlington in the 400m at Beijing 2008, and is still the British record holder, had to fight hard to hold off the double Commonwealth Games medalist Jazz Carlin, as well as Ellie Faulkner. That Jackson did it only made Adlington happier. \"I so wanted it to be Jo. Jazz and Ellie are amazing girls, but they have their whole careers ahead of them. Jo and I have so much experience together \u2013 we are such close friends.\" Gandy, one of the Guardian's Olympic diarists, has been honing her technique in the turn over the winter. She is convinced it cost her the gold in the 200m butterfly at the World Championships in Shanghai. The work she has put in told. Halsall is a sprinter and as is her style, she swam the first 50m hard and fast. Gandy was behind at the turn, but stayed underwater longer as she came back for the second 50. She and Halsall were neck-and-neck coming into the final 25m, but Gandy just edged ahead in the final few strokes. The 100m butterfly will be as fiercely a contested event as any at these Championships. In 2011 there was just 0.12 of a second between Halsall, Gandy and Lowe. And as Halsall said: \"Three into two doesn't go.\" Coming into the final, they were all in the top five of the world rankings. But Saturday night provided a salutary reminder of the difference between domestic and international success, when Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom, one of several overseas swimmers competing here to familiarise themselves with the Olympic venue, swam 56.79. Gandy knows she will most likely need to break 57 to win an Olympic medal. She is sure she can do it. \"That's what I'll be aiming for at the Olympics later this year,\" she said, before letting slip an involuntary yelp of joy as she realised what she had just said. \"Oh. I'm so glad I can say that now!\" As can Daniel Sliwinski and Craig Benson, who both qualified for the team in the 100m breaststroke. The butterfly and the freestyle made it an enthralling evening in this impressive pool, marred only by a tediously insistent MC and a headache-inducing pop soundtrack. \"It's an unbelievable venue,\" said Adlington. \"And that's been all the talk of the last two days.\" For some it took more getting used to that for others. The sinuous bulges of the roof posed problems for the backstrokers, who tend to take a steer from what they see above them. \"It's not straight,\" said Gemma Spofforth after her heat. \"It's actually quite awkward with the lights.\" Her team-mate, and rival for the title, Lizzie Simmonds agreed, to a point. \"Every roof is different,\" she said, before dissolving into giggles. \"That sounds really, really boring. It sounds as if I'm going to start discussing my conservatory.\" Liam Tancock shrugged it off. \"If the pool and roof are off kilter, you do tend to follow the roof. But we race outdoors, where there's nothing to follow apart from a few pelicans and a couple of clouds.\" All three will be back in the pool on Monday, when they will hope to be experiencing the same kind of elation as Gandy and Adlington.",

      "bodyText": "Human beings are part of nature. They are made of flesh and blood, brain and bone; but for much of the time they are also conscious. The puzzling thing is how the intricate sequences of nerve cells and tissue that make up a person's brain and body can generate the special subjective feel of conscious experience. Consciousness creates, in each of us, an inner life where we think and feel; a realm where we experience the sights, sounds, feels, tastes and smells that inform us of the world around us. To many philosophers the central problem of consciousness is, how can the facts of conscious mental life be part of the world of facts described by the natural sciences? The 17th-century philosopher, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, thought they couldn't and argued that, in addition to our physical makeup, creatures like us had a non-material mind, or soul, in which thinking took place. For Descartes, only humans were subjects of experience. Animals were mere mechanisms. When they squealed with what we mistakenly took to be pain, it was just air escaping from their lungs. Today we take other animals to be conscious; although we are not sure how far down the phylogenetic scale consciousness extends. Most problematically of all, if consciousness was immaterial, how could the immaterial soul move the physical body, or feel pain in response to physical injury? The difficulty of understanding such material-immaterial interactions is the reason most contemporary philosophers reject Descartes' mind-body dualism. Surely it is the brain that is responsible for controlling the body, so it must be the brain that gives rise to consciousness and decision-making. So how does consciousness arise in the brain? Science still has no answer. To a large extent consciousness has been dethroned from the central role it used to occupy in the study of our mental lives. Freud persuaded us that there is more going on mentally than we are consciously aware of, and that sometimes others can know more about what we are thinking and feeling than we do. Now we are also learning more and more from neuroscience and neurobiology about how much of what we do is the result of unconscious processes and mechanisms. And we are discovering that there are different levels of consciousness, different kinds of awareness, and that much of our thinking and decision-making can go on without it. So a more pressing question might be, what is consciousness for? Is it just a mere mental accompaniment to what is going to happen anyway? In that case it may be our sense of self and self-control that is most in need of revision. It's also worth remembering that the only convincing example of consciousness we have is our own. Are the people around me really conscious in the way I am, or could they be zombies who act like humans? Conscious awareness is bound up with our sense of self, but our sense of self is bound up with awareness of the body. The sense of agency and ownership of our limbs is very much part of who we are and how we operate in the world. But it can also go missing after brain injury. In rare cases of brain lesion people can experience sensations in their own hand but not think the hand or the experience belongs to them. Wittgenstein once said that no one could have an experience and wonder whose experience it was. An experience I feel has to be my experience and it is conceptually impossible to think otherwise. However, when something goes awry in the injured brain the conceptually impossible becomes possible for certain patients. So the nature of consciousness and how we experience it depends on the proper functioning of the brain. We can be aware in moving our bodies that it is our own body we are moving, and we may still have a feeling of being the agent of that movement, but it may not be our conscious decisions that initiate those movements. The sense of ourselves as consciously deciding everything we do is surely an illusion: but a persistent one. Equally, the idea that consciousness is unified and must be that way comes under increasing pressure in contemporary neuroscience. There are levels of consciousness and perhaps splits in conscious awareness. Can we have consciousness and lack awareness of it? Do we always know what our experience is like, and is experience always as it seems? Much recent experimental evidence from neuroscience suggests that this may not be the case. So it is a fruitful time for philosophers and neuroscientists to work together, to revise previous models and provide new accounts of how we perceive things and why our experience patterns in the way it does. There may be no single answer to what consciousness is, but we may still be able to find ways to explain what is going on in the brain. This would help resolve why our conscious experience takes the shape and form it does, and elucidate what happens to consciousness when one of the interacting systems that make possible the self-knowing mind breaks down. These phenomena provide vital clues about the neural correlates of consciousness and are a step on the road to understanding why things work as they do. Getting at the elusive nature of our own experience and freeing ourselves from faulty interpretations is a tricky business. Many disciplines are needed if we are to make a real breakthrough. \u2022 Professor Barry Smith will take part in a panel discussion, organised by the Guardian, on the nature of consciousness \u2013 and whether science will ever be able to explain it \u2013 at the Royal Institution in London on Wednesday at 7pm \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

So Aunt Blanche (Alex Kingston) turned out to be a lesbian. Who knew? Surely anyone who recognises the period drama shorthand which has been telegraphed from the first episode. All the signs were there: inquiring mind, no makeup, Virginia Woolf-type clothes, comfortable shoes... And lo, here comes Portia (Emilia Fox), the author of The Golden Blaze, a swoonsome novel detailing their romance amongst the archaeological ruins of the Egyptian desert! \"Rosalind's body was being filled with spices...\" This being BBC1 we did not really get to see any major league spice-filling. Just some dishevelled hairstyles. 165 Eaton Place was ablaze with scandal for, ooh, all of about five minutes \u2013 one dinner was even cancelled! \u2013 until they moved onto the next dozen dramas. Lady Persie (Claire Foy), meanwhile, is pregnant by her Nazi lover and has become an ardent fan of gin, hot baths and vigorous horse-riding. She later answers an advert in the paper for a backstreet cure for \"menstrual irregularity.\" Sir Hallam (Ed Stoppard), her brother-in-law and erstwhile kissing companion, appeared to head randomly to Berlin to confront Friedrich the Nazi who basically shrugged, \"She slept with the entire party. Not my problem.\" The downstairs plot offered no more sanity. Beryl (Laura Haddock) decided to fight for her rights when she and Eunice (Ami Metcalf \u2013 lovely actress) were given extra household duties, despite Mr Pritchard's insistence that \"This is Belgravia. Not Leningrad.\" The relationship between Spargo the chauffeur (Neil Jackson) and Beryl did not move forward, disappointingly. And the war? Hello? What happened to the war? It's still 1939 but no one seemed to notice this week that there might be one or two little things going on in the outside world. Things which infused us with a joy equal to the fuzzy peach glow of Lady Agnes's peignoir I'm grasping at straws here. The wardrobe of Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) brings no end of joy. Her green Robin Hood hat for her visit to Miss Buck was adorable, as was the dress with the swallows on it.

The most fabulous mixture of envious delight and loyal, butlerly discretion. Things that bathed us in a misery reminiscent of the gassing of Solomon the monkey Where to start. Where was the comedy? Where were Mr Pritchard's wonderful one-liners? Where were simple, understandable plot lines? One is trying so hard to enjoy this programme and immerse oneself in it.

I almost threw a matted rabbit's foot at the screen when the BBC announcer came on at the end, talking about Herr Hitler.

Although I'm not so sure she would have been as horrified as he claimed by Blanche's \"tendencies\". Sir Hallam was right about one thing, though. The house has indeed been in a complete mess since Lady Maud passed away. But less because of her death and more because of a screenplay that tries to make 573 things happen simultaneously. \"Could we get in more food and drink references in if we tried?\" Oh, misery. This week one could not even distract oneself by counting food references. We had a measly grapefruit with the last cherry on it, rejected by Lady Percy as she pined for Friedrich the Nazi. We had one solitary Garibaldi for Beryl to sustain her during her appeal to the union representative about conditions in the house.

      "bodyText": "The most powerful scene in the TV drama Homeland so far came at the end of the second episode. Brody, the US marine who has returned home after eight years as a captive of al-Qaida, creeps out of his bedroom at dawn. He heads for his garage, the one room in his home unseen by the surveillance equipment installed by Carrie, the obsessive CIA agent who suspects him. She reckons Brody might have been turned by his captors, that he might even be planning a terror attack. We know he has something in that garage, because we saw him stash a bag in there. He opens the bag and we brace ourselves. What comes out is a small rug, which he rolls on to the floor. Brody, the all-American war hero, then kneels, faces the dawn light and intones, \"Allahu Akbar\", as he begins the morning prayers of a faithful Muslim. Of course, we know there are white American converts to Islam, but there is an extra charge in seeing such a transformation in a US marine, one who has been beaten, tortured and imprisoned by jihadist extremists. The audience's prejudices are being toyed with: are we really assuming that, just because a man becomes a Muslim, he might also now be a terrorist? But I had another thought as I watched that scene, imagining how it would have played in the original. For Homeland is an adaptation of an Israeli TV drama, Hatufim (The Abducted Ones). And the shock value of seeing a returned Jewish Israeli soldier reciting a Muslim prayer would have been twice as intense. That is true of every aspect of Homeland. Yes, a returning PoW would be big news in the US. But in Israel, a small country with a civilian, conscript army \u2013 in which every family has a son, brother or father in uniform \u2013 a missing soldier is an ongoing national trauma never far from public consciousness. When Hatufim first aired in Israel in 2009, Israelis had been waiting for the real-life Gilad Shalit \u2013 captured as a 19-year-old by Hamas fighters near the Gaza border \u2013 for three years. His face was on posters and bumper-stickers; songs played for him on the radio. I was in Israel the week of Shalit's release last October. The public and media hoopla was huge. Next to that, Homeland's version of Brody's homecoming felt underdone. There would surely have been a media encampment outside the Brody family home on the morning of his return, as there was for Shalit. A motorcade would have taken them back; he would not have driven his family home unaccompanied. Above all, Brody would surely have looked the way Shalit did \u2013 frail, emaciated and haunted. For Israelis, the notion raised in Hatufim \u2013 that a soldier who had suffered Shalit's fate might be working for the enemy \u2013 was beyond taboo. Homeland is powerful but I suspect the original, due to air on Sky Arts in May, might be even stronger.",

      "bodyText": "SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching Homeland on Channel 4. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode three \u2013 and if you've seen further in the series, please do not leave spoilers Rebecca Nicholson's episode two blog As predicted last week, things did not end well for asset Lynne, who received a couple of close-range bullets for her patriotic efforts. Brody's illness seems to be abating while Carrie's begins to spiral (there are nice parallel touches, as with last week, when both were lying on their sofas at the same time), and the terrorism plot moves on, with the suspicious couple buying their house in cash. Near an airport. Dun dun derrrr. Brody Brody spends much of the episode transforming from corner-hugging PTSD victim to superdad, bringing sulky Dana out of her teenage shell. There is a sense that he probably knows about his wife and Captain Mike's affair, even though it's unsaid, as yet \u2013 that particularly awkward sex scene may have been part of it. His TV interviews, from the walk in the park (though it was anything but, filled with torture flashbacks) to his all-American family hour, suggest he's finding his feet at home again, but he's still sleeping on the floor. A distinct lack of terroristy behaviour, this week, then. Carrie While Brody remains relatively contained, Carrie is increasingly reckless \u2013 her reaction to Lynne's death didn't demonstrate the kind of cool professionalism you'd expect from a CIA agent. But there are signs of her composure slipping before that. When she meets Lynne at the pool, Lynne asks her what she's expecting to find \u2013 and she tells her, in a lot of detail. Not exactly discreet. Her meltdown in front of Saul shows that she's human, but her efficiency is looking precarious. Of course, he leads her to question the necklace and its use. It's the easiest way to move wealth. Is that how Prince Farid plans to fund this suspected attack? It looks to be that way. Notes and observations \u2022 Thanks for all the comments so far \u2013 some interesting discussion of the show's successes and failure. The eagle eyes of Shinsei pointed out that Brody was enjoying a couple of beers at the barbecue in the first episode, which may cast doubt on the depths of his \"conversion\". \u2022 As soon as Lynne said \"I've downloaded his phone for you. I'm done\", the cards were on the table. \u2022 In one of Brody's flashbacks, he is clean-shaven and smartly dressed \u2013 at what point was this? He was very beardy by the time of his rescue. Is that part of the plan? \u2022 \"It was this video called YouTube\" \u2013 a nice reminder that Brody has been away for eight long years. \u2022 There's still a fair bit of clunky exposition going on, not least in the final scene, when the estate agent painfully crowbars in the fact that they've bought their first house in cash. \u2022 Some might argue that there's a fair bit of sexposition going on, too. Thoughts? Less clumsy than last week's episode? Is it moving at enough of a pace?",

Don't read on if you haven't seen episode three \u2013 and if you've seen further in the series, please do not leave spoilers</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/feb/26/homeland-season-one-episode-two?commentpage=last#end-of-comments\" title=\"\">Rebecca Nicholson's episode two blog</a></p> <p>As predicted last week, things did not end well for asset Lynne, who received a couple of close-range bullets for her patriotic efforts. Brody's illness seems to be abating while Carrie's begins to spiral (there are nice parallel touches, as with last week, when both were lying on their sofas at the same time), and the terrorism plot moves on, with the suspicious couple buying their house in cash. Near an airport. Dun dun derrrr.</p> <h2>Brody</h2> <p>Brody spends much of the episode transforming from corner-hugging PTSD victim to superdad, bringing sulky Dana out of her teenage shell. There is a sense that he probably knows about his wife and Captain Mike's affair, even though it's unsaid, as yet \u2013 that particularly awkward sex scene may have been part of it. His TV interviews, from the walk in the park (though it was anything but, filled with torture flashbacks) to his all-American family hour, suggest he's finding his feet at home again, but he's still sleeping on the floor. A distinct lack of terroristy behaviour, this week, then.</p> <h2>Carrie</h2> <p>While Brody remains relatively contained, Carrie is increasingly reckless \u2013 her reaction to Lynne's death didn't demonstrate the kind of cool professionalism you'd expect from a CIA agent. But there are signs of her composure slipping before that. When she meets Lynne at the pool, Lynne asks her what she's expecting to find \u2013 and she tells her, in a lot of detail. Not exactly discreet. Her meltdown in front of Saul shows that she's human, but her efficiency is looking precarious. Of course, he leads her to question the necklace and its use. It's the easiest way to move wealth. Is that how Prince Farid plans to fund this suspected attack? It looks to be that way.</p> <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <p>\u2022 Thanks for all the comments so far \u2013 some interesting discussion of the show's successes and failure. The eagle eyes of Shinsei pointed out that Brody was enjoying a couple of beers at the barbecue in the first episode, which may cast doubt on the depths of his \"conversion\".</p> <p>\u2022 As soon as Lynne said \"I've downloaded his phone for you. I'm done\", the cards were on the table.</p> <p>\u2022 In one of Brody's flashbacks, he is clean-shaven and smartly dressed \u2013 at what point was this? He was very beardy by the time of his rescue. Is that part of the plan?</p> <p>\u2022 \"It was this video called YouTube\" \u2013 a nice reminder that Brody has been away for eight long years.</p> <p>\u2022 There's still a fair bit of clunky exposition going on, not least in the final scene, when the estate agent painfully crowbars in the fact that they've bought their first house in cash.</p> <p>\u2022 Some might argue that there's a fair bit of sexposition going on, too.</p> <p>Thoughts? Less clumsy than last week's episode? Is it moving at enough of a pace?</p>",

Humble says everything jauntily. She'd be a useless grief counsellor. But anyone who realises they're not going to have to spend weeks sitting in a barn with Bill Oddie is entitled to be giddy with joie de vivre. Humble was going much faster than us sofa-bound blobs: at one point she barrelled at 96kph down an empty road in Ecuador that runs along the Equator at 96kph to clinch the point that Earth's middle moves faster than any other part as the planet rotates. She was going at 96kph plus 1,670kph, which, if you've ever studied addition, you'll know is quick. She was, at that moment, probably the fastest person on Earth. \"I like her,\" my six-year-old daughter said. \"She's got nice hair.\" But Humble's more than that: she's a role model to anxious parents like me who live in fear that their daughters will aspire to nothing better than bumping and grinding their way to celebrity. I'm in a Girl Group! (BBC2) asked what life was like for the musical sisterhoods at the top of the charts. Yawn. In Orbit: Earth's Extraordinary Journey (BBC2), the Humble telescope was zooming in on the world's extreme conditions. Yes, Humble's enthusiasm is as brisk and mirthless as a cavity search, but that doesn't matter. \"I'm Dr Helen Czerski,\" said co-presenter Dr Helen Czerski who is, as you know, a doctor. She's more of a role model than Humble because, though she does action-woman stuff like sky-diving over Arizona and getting her hair buffeted in Cornwall, she's also a physicist. She explained the meteorologically crucial coriolis effect while throwing and catching a ball on a spinning playground roundabout. \"She's a good catcher,\" said my daughter admiringly. But, again, Czerski is more than that. She's a graduate of Brian Cox's Remedial School of TV Presenting that turns northern nerds into sexpots. She stood moodily in long shot on a beach in Mexico, back to camera, legs apart, waiting for a hurricane that never came. Cox should sue for infringement of image rights. Did you know, incidentally, that the Earth rotates at 23.5 degrees from vertical, while Uranus (don't start) spins at 98 degrees and so has summers that last for 21 years? How depressing for Uranians if their summers are as rubbish as our last one was. Czerski has a way of talking to camera as she walks, elbows pointing at her kidneys, explanatory fingers flailing like a Tyrannosaurus Rex's, glowing down the lens intimately as though you and she had a thing last night. Maybe you did. It's like being ineptly propositioned by a life form you thought extinct, which is unsettling. Even so, I want my daughter to be Dr Czerski rather than, say, Alesha Dixon. I wonder, though, how much this show cost. In olden times, Raymond Baxter would have explained the coriolis effect in a studio with a globe and string; today we need two presenters racking up air miles, sumptuous camerawork and state-of-the-art CGI to explain basic features of our home planet at primary-school levels. The mysteries of planetary motion are deep indeed, but not as deep as the mysteries of BBC2 scheduling. Why was this programme on after the watershed when I'm in a Girl Group! went out on the same channel three hours earlier? Has no one thought about about how such scheduling will reduce girls' applications to physics courses and boost them for X Factor? No wonder we increasingly time-shift our viewing; schedulers aren't screening what we want when we want it. Who are the suspicious couple who moved into the house next to the airport in Homeland (Channel 4)? QPR's latest owners? The guys who may or may not have turned Damian Lewis in Iraq? Fanatics bent on bringing the west to its knees? Only one thing is certain: Claire Danes, ceaselessly unsmiling, is going to stick to her task of nailing this case, whatever the Langley suits say. She's a good role model for girls, too.",

And, though it may be harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than to pass through the eye of a needle, multimillionaires should have no problem passing through the door of the Oval Office. Religion and politics have always made uneasy bedfellows; yet how can Christians from all shades of the political spectrum reconcile their diverse views with the teachings of a single man? A study led by Lee Ross of Stanford University in California has found that the Jesus of liberal Christians is very different from the one envisaged by conservatives. The researchers asked respondents to imagine what Jesus would have thought about contemporary issues such as taxation, immigration, same-sex marriage and abortion. Perhaps not surprisingly, Christian Republicans imagined a Jesus who tended to be against wealth redistribution, illegal immigrants, abortion and same-sex marriage; whereas the Jesus of Democrat-voting Christians would have had far more liberal opinions. The Bible may claim that God created man in his own image, but the study suggests man creates God in his own image. Yet both groups recognised that their own views were not always identical to those of Jesus. The researchers divided issues into those concerned with fellowship (wealth distribution, immigration), and those concerned with morality (gay rights, abortion). Conservatives envisaged a Jesus with views close to their own on morality issues; but they recognised that the man who gave all his possessions to the poor would probably have advocated more progressive taxation policies than those of the Republican party. Conversely, liberals saw Jesus as having similar views as themselves on fellowship issues but they believed his views on gay rights would be to the right of their own. The social psychologist Leon Festinger coined the term \"cognitive dissonance\" for the discomfort felt when we recognise conflict between our ideas and perceptions. He proposed that we tend to reduce conflict by altering our view of reality. This process of \"dissonance reduction\" (\"I didn't want that job anyway\") has been used down the centuries to reduce the conflict between a person's religious convictions and their actions. When in the 13th century the Abbot Arnaud Amaury was asked by crusaders what do with the citizens of the town of Beziers who were a mix of both pious Christians and heretical Albigensians, he famously initiated a massacre of all the town's inhabitants with the instructions, \"Kill them all. God will know his own.\" Similarly, in the 19th century, Christian slavers insisted that the enforced transport and enslavement of millions of Africans was justified because it brought God to a pagan people. The researchers discovered that conservatives believe Jesus would have prioritised the moral issues close to their own hearts, and that disparities in wealth or the treatment of illegal immigrants wouldn't have been high on his agenda. Liberals believed the opposite. Ross and his colleagues suggest that dissonance reduction takes place not only within the individual, but as a collective enterprise. Preachers, politicians and co-believers tend to emphasise and de-emphasise different aspects of the Christian canon; so conservative Americans study the Old Testament with its homophobic rhetoric and eye-for-an-eye morality, whereas liberals look to the New Testament Jesus who was sympathetic to the poor and the meek. Evangelical politics is not, of course, limited to the US. Many social conservatives in the UK align themselves with the Christian right, and MPs such as Nadine Dorries take inspiration from US campaigns against abortion or gay rights. But perhaps the most striking aspect of the study is that it turns on its head the claims by many religious politicians, such as Republican nomination candidates Rick Santorum (\"I'm for income inequality\"), Rick Perry (\"Homosexuality is a sin\"), or the UK's Nadine Dorries (\"My faith tells me who I am\"), that their politics is inspired by their God.

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin has claimed a resounding victory in Russia's presidential election, provoking a furious response from opposition activists who alleged that the vote was marred by widespread fraud. At a rally in front of the Kremlin an emotional Putin, with tears running down his face and flanked by the outgoing president, Dmitry Medvedev, said: \"I promised you we would win. We have won. Glory to Russia.\" Putin congratulated his supporters for preventing unidentified outside forces from determining the country's fate, angrily reiterating his charge that the unprecedented protests against his rule that have rocked the country since a contested parliamentary vote in December have been curated by the west. \"We showed that no one can direct us in anything!\" Putin said. \"We were able to save ourselves from political provocations, which have one goal: to destroy Russian sovereignty and usurp power.\" The central election commission gave Putin 63% with 22% of votes counted. The state-run VTsIOM polling agency said its exit polls predicted that Putin would take 58.3% of the vote. But as with the December vote, independent election monitors and opposition activists presented evidence of widespread falsifications, including ballot stuffing and \"carousel voting\" \u2013 packing vans with voters and bussing them to several polling sites to cast numerous votes. The Kremlin set up webcams in polling sites to combat fraud. One camera caught a man stuffing voting papers into a ballot box in Dagestan. Putin's supporters rejected claims of voting irregularities. \"This is the cleanest election in Russia's entire history,\" said his campaign chief, Stanislav Govorukhin. \"The violations our rivals and the opponents of our president will now speak of are laughable.\" Some in Moscow said their support for Putin was a vote for stability. \"I voted for Putin because there are no other candidates,\" said Elena, a 50-year-old teacher voting at a school in western Moscow. Many opposition activists had hoped to force Putin into a second round and questioned his landslide victory. \"Putin has named himself the emperor of Russia for the next 12 years,\" said the protest leader Alexey Navalny. \"We announced earlier that we will not recognise these elections. The powers here are illegitimate \u2013 this is their only way to remain in power.\" Thousands were due to take to the streets on Monday to express their discontent with the result. \"Can [Putin] hold on to power for the full six years? I think not,\" Navalny said. \"My supporters and I will use various peaceful means to ensure that this person, who has no legitimate right to hold this post, will not hold it for six years.\" Putin, who has already served as president from 1999 to 2008, will return to the presidency following an inauguration in early May. Constitutional changes instituted by Medvedev extended the presidential term from four to six years. Beyond the election day reports of fraud, Putin's critics said the vote was illegitimate before it began. They accused him of unfairly using administrative resources, including state-run television, to advance his candidacy and to refuse to register candidates such as the liberal Yabloko leader, Grigory Yavlinsky. Putin's official opponents lagged far behind. The Communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, came in second with early results showing he took 17.37% of the vote. The billionaire latecomer Mikhail Prokhorov took nearly 8%, while the far-right nationalist firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky took nearly 7.5%. Sergei Mironov, who abstained from throwing his support behind Putin, unlike in previous elections, came in last with 3.67%. Several regions reported huge support for Putin. More than 76% of voters in the far-eastern region of Chukotka, formerly governed by Chelsea FC's owner, Roman Abramovich, voted for Putin, the election commission said. The troubled Caucasus region, in accordance with what has already become tradition, also presented near unanimous support for Putin. In Moscow, the Kremlin was on high alert as thousands of police and interior ministry troops deployed in the centre. Tens of thousands of members of the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi were bussed in from around the country to attend a victory rally. Despite the Kremlin's insistence that the vote was not decided in advance, a stage was constructed as early as Sunday morning in anticipation of the victory rally. The protest movement against Putin has found its greatest strength in Moscow, launched after a 4 December parliamentary vote marred by widespread evidence of fraud. Some 370,000 Russians signed up to act as independent election monitors after the vote, an unprecedented show of civic activism born of the growing protest movement against Putin's rule. Putin voted alongside his rarely seen wife, Lyudmila Putina, at the Russian Academy of Sciences. Fifteen minutes after he left the polling site, three women tore off their shirts and began shouting \"Putin is a thief\". They were dragged away by police and one activist was later sentenced to 10 days in jail.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Alex Ferguson identified Manchester United's title-winning experience as vital after the defeat of Tottenham Hotspur and pledged they would \"not get nervous\" at the point of the season that, courtesy of the Old Trafford manager, is known as squeaky-bum time. Ferguson admitted his side had \"carried a bit of luck\" in the 3-1 victory at White Hart Lane but he also described it as United's most satisfying result away from Old Trafford this season. The gap to Manchester City at the top has been brought back to two points, and United's manager believes his players have the championship knowhow to catch and overhaul a club chasing their first title since 1968. \"You can drop points, surprise points, and I think it will happen, but the important thing for us now is not to drop as many as they do,\" Ferguson said. \"We've got experience. We won't get nervous, we're enjoying it, and the battling performance today against a very, very good team tells you that we're up for it. To come here and get that result is really first class. \"I would say that was our hardest away game of the season. If you look at their home record this season and their percentage of possession in home games, it's 58% on average. That tells you how difficult it was to come to Spurs and win. They'd lost one other home game \u2013 their first one, against City, when they had a few injury problems. So that was the magnitude of our challenge today.\" The defeat means Tottenham have taken only eight points from their last seven games and, for the first time, Harry Redknapp was asked whether the speculation about him becoming the next England manager was affecting the team. He denied it, emphatically. \"My focus is completely on Spurs. I don't take days off, I'm here every day and I don't think anybody could have seen that game and come away not thinking we were unlucky. We just didn't get a break but you couldn't fault our effort. \"I'm suicidal when we lose usually. I'm the worst person in the world when it comes to dealing with losing but I really can't be disappointed with that performance. I came in at half-time and I really couldn't believe we were losing. We'd dominated them.\" Ferguson sympathised with the Spurs manager, admitting United had been pinned back for long periods. \"Scoring right on half-time was a killer for Tottenham. They were probably sitting in that dressing room wondering how it was 1-0 because they had played ever so well.\" Tottenham scored a consolation through the substitute Jermain Defoe and also had an Emmanuel Adebayor goal controversially ruled out when the game was still 0-0. Ferguson said: \"The ball was going in and he stopped it from going in the net. I don't know why he's done that. But he definitely handballed it.\" Ferguson added: \"We dug in, defended fantastically well, the goalkeeper [David de Gea] made a fantastic save in the second half [from Jake Livermore's deflected shot]. In the first half, we were never at the races. The smoothness in our game didn't come until the second goal.\" United now embark on a run of eight games that has them playing West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Fulham, Blackburn Rovers, QPR, Wigan Athletic, Aston Villa and Everton before meeting City at the Etihad Stadium on 30 April. \"We're in a really good position now,\" Ferguson said. \"We've got players coming back. [Tom]Cleverley will be fit next week, [Chris]Smalling will be fit for Thursday's game [against Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League]. Players are coming back, and if we've got a full squad we've got a better chance. We've shown this before, and we know exactly what we have to do.\"",

And I'm scared', 1 March). We are hearing more and more about the rough and ready care of elderly people in Britain \u2013 the legacy of Thatcher's and New Labour's privatising policies of homes for the elderly and \"care (not) in the community\". The feature describes the vast number of elderly people left struggling and isolated like Mary \u2013 yet we read in the same article of the staggering amount of money floating around and out into shareholder accounts via this rotten system. Why can't a huge charity such as Age UK get hold of some of this money to organise nationwide, not-for-profit, co-operative-style housing communities for the over 60s, offering a communal life (optional of course) for residents while keeping the billions of pounds inside a virtuous circle sans shareholders? Surely such a trusted charity as Age UK could act as a housing association/co-op, charging rents at cost \u2013 not for profit \u2013 employing staff on reasonable, normal pay scales. Is such an idea so impossible? No one is getting younger. It could be you \u2013 very soon. Sandi Dunn London \u2022 Mary, and your readers, may be interested to know that attendance allowance is a non-means-tested benefit available to everyone aged 65 or over needing help with personal care due to physical or mental disability.

Pat Nicholls St Neots, Cambridgeshire \u2022 Just weeks after marking Dignity Action Day, we have a report highlighting how we are failing to give people dignity in hospital and care settings (Report, 29 February). The draft report of the Commission on Dignity in Care calls for \"changes to culture, leadership, management, staff development, clinical practice and service delivery\" . Surely the need for greater dignity goes deeper than that. At what point did we, as a society, stop treating each other \u2013 young or old \u2013 with dignity and respect? If respect was regarded as a fundamental in our education and upbringing we would not need campaign action days and reports telling us how to do it. Mike Padgham Chair, UK Homecare Association \u2022 The disdain for the elderly highlighted in the report is merely a symptom of a national malaise. The elderly repeatedly hear themselves described as \"bed blockers\"; their state pensions (an extra 25p a week at 80), winter fuel allowances and free travel passes are, apparently, bringing the country to its financial knees. They are, so they're told, \"selfish\" in continuing to occupy family homes judged to be too large for them. Is it any wonder that some people carry this ethos into their work? BJ Cairns London \u2022 The findings of the commission offer an encouraging step forward but are insufficient in two respects. Firstly, we should not kid ourselves that this is a recent problem. Thirty years ago, student nurses rotating in a London teaching hospital to geriatric medicine complained of \"six weeks wasted shit shovelling\". Unlike Holby City, most nursing is prosaic, and change will take time and determination. Testing the values of staff, and ascertaining emotional intelligence in recruitment, will improve care. But hands-on care involves confronting on a daily basis things most of the population shy away from. Powerful, primitive emotions are evoked by pain, bodily functions, despair and death. For staff to understand and cope with these feelings they need regular and positive support: few NHS organisations currently address these issues. Kevin Lewis Farnham, Surrey \u2022 The simple, heartfelt and poignant message from Christine Bryden when commenting about being cared for with dementia ('It's the way you talk to us, not what you say, that we will remember', 29 February) moved me to tears. Those words should be the motto for the NHS and displayed on every hospital and care home wall as a reminder of what true personalised care is all about. We seem to have forgotten what really matters in our society today and, as Christine Bryden pleads: \"We're still here in emotion and spirit \u2013 if only you could find us.\" If only the NHS could find the will and motivation to gain an understanding of what really matters to patients and their relatives and make the simple changes so very obviously needed for a return to dignified care for all. Janet Bale Hambleton, Lancashire \u2022 If you believed the media, you would think every single care home is on the brink of financial collapse, full of staff who are at best indifferent and at worst downright abusive. This simply is not the case. There are more than 21,000 care homes in the UK, the vast majority of them staffed by compassionate, caring individuals who work incredibly hard in very demanding circumstances. Yes, there have been scandals. Yes, we are facing unprecedented financial pressures. There are many homes that could be significantly improved, and there is an urgent need for reform, both financial and regulatory. But to tar all care homes with the same brush does society a massive disservice, by striking fear into the hearts of older people who would get an incredible benefit from residential care. It also demotivates the many thousands of care home workers who do a fantastic job. Leon Smith Chief executive, Nightingale care home, London",

      "bodyText": "There is a spectre haunting Europe \u2013 the spectre of mass unemployment. On Thursday it was announced that the eurozone's unemployment rate had risen to a record high of 10.7% in January. That's 16.9 million people out of work across the 17-nation euro area. Across the 27-member European Union unemployment is also topping 10% for the first time: a jaw-dropping 24.3 million jobless. The sheer size of the continent's growing army of unemployed workers is difficult to comprehend. Spain holds the EU record, with unemployment at 23.3%, or 5.3 million people \u2013 and rising. \"This is the terrible cancer of our society,\" said Rafael Zornoza Boy, the bishop of Cadiz, last week. Yet prime minister Mariano Rajoy's new (and conservative) government's pleas to give Madrid some leeway on spending cuts fell on deaf ears at Friday's EU summit of fiscal self-flagellists in Brussels. Then there is poor Greece, where EU-imposed cuts have left one in five unemployed and have driven up the suicide rate by 40%. Austerity is, literally, killing Europeans. Poll after poll shows voters across the EU care much more about the jobs deficit than they do about the budget deficit. Nonetheless, the proverbial Martian, landing in Brussels last week, would have been stunned to witness the complacency and indifference of the continent's political elites to the crisis of spiralling joblessness. EU leaders continue to fiddle \u2013 over borrowing limits, fiscal compacts, treaty changes \u2013 as their economies crash and burn. The austerity gamble hasn't paid off. Fiscal consolidation has failed to spur growth or boost employment. Fiscal stimulus, on the other hand, works. The US has had 23 consecutive months of private-sector job growth, with 3.7m new jobs created over the past two years thanks to Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. US unemployment benefit claims are now at a four-year low. But Europe's political and financial elites \u2013 led by austerity junkies such as \"Merkozy\", the European Central Bank's Mario Draghi and, of course, our very own David Cameron \u2013 pretend not to notice. Here on the jobless side of the Atlantic, the only solution to austerity-induced unemployment, it seems, is more austerity. In Brussels, eurozone finance ministers threatened to impose swingeing fines on those member states, such as Spain and the Netherlands, that may miss their budget deficit targets. If insanity, as Albert Einstein is said to have once remarked, is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, then our leaders have gone mad. The irony is that mass unemployment itself is the biggest barrier to deficit reduction. Basic economics teaches us that the best way to cut borrowing levels is to get people back to work and paying taxes. Or as John Maynard Keynes put it: \"Look after unemployment and the budget will look after itself.\" But Europe's crisis isn't just about economics. Unlike GDP or inflation, unemployment is the only major economic indicator that measures real human beings, rather than growth or prices. Having a job isn't just about earning a living or paying taxes; it's about human dignity and self-worth. The human and social costs of unemployment are well-documented: financial hardship, emotional stress, depression, lethargy, loss of morale and status, shame, sickness and premature death. Then there is the hopelessness that often leads to rising crime, disorder and social unrest. We can probably expect a new wave of riots and violence in the continent's city centres. The tragedy is that there is nothing unavoidable about Europe's unemployment crisis. The US is proof that even the most modest of fiscal stimuli can create jobs. But politicians in Germany, where mass unemployment in the 1930s helped the Nazis seize power, refuse to countenance any loosening of the fiscal purse strings inside the EU, arguing that such a move would increase borrowing costs and might panic the bond markets. Yet, as the Nobel-prizewinning economist Christopher Pissarides has written, \"a small rise in gilt interest rates is a small price to pay for more jobs\". Here in the UK, where unemployment stands at a 17-year high of 2.7 million (or a staggering 6.3 million if the \"underemployed\" are included), our own do-nothing chancellor, George Osborne, continues to proclaim that \"the British government has run out of money\". Really? Perhaps he should have a word with Mervyn King. Over the past three years, the Bank of England governor has, with a mere tap on his keyboard, authorised the creation of \u00a3325bn of new money, out of thin air, through a process of \"quantitative easing\" (QE). This, however, has so far been used only to bail out the bankers. Why not use it to bail out millions of jobless Britons? If we assume it would cost \u00a326,000 (the median salary for UK workers) to create each new job, the cost to the government of putting a million people back to work would be \u00a326bn \u2013 or around half of the latest \u00a350bn tranche of QE released by the Bank last month. How many more of Europe's jobs will be sacrificed at the altar of deficit reduction?

      "body": "<p>There is a spectre haunting Europe \u2013 the spectre of mass unemployment. On Thursday it was announced that the eurozone's unemployment rate had risen to a record high of 10.7% in January. That's 16.9 million people out of work across the 17-nation euro area.</p> <p>Across the 27-member European Union unemployment is also topping 10% for the first time: a jaw-dropping 24.3 million jobless. The sheer size of the continent's growing army of unemployed workers is difficult to comprehend.</p> <p>Spain holds the EU record, with unemployment at 23.3%, or 5.3 million people \u2013 and rising. \"This is the terrible cancer of our society,\" said Rafael Zornoza Boy, the bishop of Cadiz, last week. Yet prime minister Mariano Rajoy's new (and conservative) government's pleas to give Madrid some leeway on spending cuts fell on deaf ears at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/02/eurozone-crisis-live-eu-summit-growth\" title=\"\">Friday's EU summit</a> of fiscal self-flagellists in Brussels. Then there is poor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece\" title=\"\">Greece</a>, where EU-imposed cuts have left one in five unemployed and have driven up the suicide rate by 40%. Austerity is, literally, killing Europeans.</p> <p>Poll after poll shows voters across the EU care much more about the jobs deficit than they do about the budget deficit. Nonetheless, the proverbial Martian, landing in Brussels last week, would have been stunned to witness the complacency and indifference of the continent's political elites to the crisis of spiralling joblessness. EU leaders continue to fiddle \u2013 over borrowing limits, fiscal compacts, treaty changes \u2013 as their economies crash and burn. The austerity gamble hasn't paid off. Fiscal consolidation has failed to spur growth or boost employment.</p> <p>Fiscal stimulus, on the other hand, works. The US has had 23 consecutive months of private-sector job growth, with 3.7m new jobs created over the past two years thanks to Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. US unemployment benefit claims are now at a four-year low.</p> <p>But Europe's political and financial elites \u2013 led by austerity junkies such as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/10080034\" title=\"\">Merkozy</a>\", the European Central Bank's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9113256/Mario-Draghi-the-man-behind-Europes-big-bazooka.html\" title=\"\">Mario Draghi</a> and, of course, our very own David Cameron \u2013 pretend not to notice. Here on the jobless side of the Atlantic, the only solution to austerity-induced unemployment, it seems, is more austerity. In Brussels, eurozone finance ministers threatened to impose swingeing fines on those member states, such as Spain and the Netherlands, that may miss their budget deficit targets. If insanity, as Albert Einstein is said to have once remarked, is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, then our leaders have gone mad.</p> <p>The irony is that mass unemployment itself is the biggest barrier to deficit reduction. Basic economics teaches us that the best way to cut borrowing levels is to get people back to work and paying taxes. Or as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/keynes_john_maynard.shtml\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes</a> put it: \"Look after unemployment and the budget will look after itself.\"</p> <p>But Europe's crisis isn't just about economics. Unlike GDP or inflation, unemployment is the only major economic indicator that measures real human beings, rather than growth or prices.</p> <p>Having a job isn't just about earning a living or paying taxes; it's about human dignity and self-worth. The human and social costs of unemployment are well-documented: financial hardship, emotional stress, depression, lethargy, loss of morale and status, shame, sickness and premature death. Then there is the hopelessness that often leads to rising crime, disorder and social unrest. We can probably expect a new wave of riots and violence in the continent's city centres.</p> <p>The tragedy is that there is nothing unavoidable about Europe's unemployment crisis. The US is proof that even the most modest of fiscal stimuli can create jobs. But politicians in Germany, where mass unemployment in the 1930s helped the Nazis seize power, refuse to countenance any loosening of the fiscal purse strings inside the EU, arguing that such a move would increase borrowing costs and might panic the bond markets. Yet, as the Nobel-prizewinning economist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/11/nobel-prize-for-economics-three-winners?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Christopher Pissarides</a> has written, \"a small rise in gilt interest rates is a small price to pay for more jobs\".</p> <p>Here in the UK, where unemployment stands at a 17-year high of 2.7 million (or a staggering 6.3 million if the \"underemployed\" are included), our own do-nothing chancellor, George Osborne, continues to proclaim that \"the British government has run out of money\". Really? Perhaps he should have a word with Mervyn King. Over the past three years, the Bank of England governor has, with a mere tap on his keyboard, authorised the creation of \u00a3325bn of new money, out of thin air, through a process of \"quantitative easing\" (QE). This, however, has so far been used only to bail out the bankers. Why not use it to bail out millions of jobless Britons?</p> <p>If we assume it would cost \u00a326,000 (the median salary for UK workers) to create each new job, the cost to the government of putting a million people back to work would be \u00a326bn \u2013 or around half of the latest \u00a350bn tranche of QE released by the Bank last month.</p> <p>How many more of Europe's jobs will be sacrificed at the altar of deficit reduction? How many more lives ruined, families impoverished and communities destroyed in pursuit of growth-choking, job-killing, self-defeating austerity? It is unacceptable for governments to stand by as dole queues lengthen. Unemployment is not a price worth paying. Nor is it a price that has to be paid.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/uk-edition\" title=\"\"><em>@commentisfree</em></a></p>",

In the medicine cabinet are some sleeping tablets your doctor gave you, but the media has been full of warnings that they aren't safe. A paper published last week in the journal BMJ Open looked at 10,500 people who had taken sleeping tablets and compared them to similar people who had not taken medication. It found that people who took pills twice a month or more are nearly four times as likely to die early as those who don't. So should you bin the sleeping pills or take a couple to break the cycle of insomnia? After all, being sleep deprived makes you miserable, knackered and liable to crash the car. The solution The research paper showed an association with an increased risk of dying early even for people taking small numbers of sleeping tablets (fewer than 18 pills a year). Taking more than 132 pills a year was associated with increased risks of lymphoma, lung, colon and prostate cancer. However, an association only means that there may be a link \u2013 the paper doesn't prove that sleeping tablets are the cause of people dying earlier. But sleeping pills do have side-effects, such as causing day-time sleepiness and affecting short-term memory. Even so, some doctors will suggest that you try these medicines to help you break a cycle of insomnia. Taking them for three to five days is usually enough to get back into a habit of sleeping normally. You should not use them routinely because of the risk of addiction. There is also evidence that melatonin (a hormone that controls your body clock) helps you get to sleep and sleep longer, but you will need a prescription for it. It is easy to get worked up about not sleeping, but often your body will sort it out over a few days. It can be normal to take up to 20 minutes to doze off, so you should be realistic and not get anxious if you don't drop off immediately. Practice what doctors call \"sleep hygiene\", which means avoiding stimulants such as caffeine, nicotine or alcohol in the late evening, or looking at a computer screen before you go to sleep. You should start winding down in the hour before bed and make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark and comfortable. There is some evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which involves thinking positively instead of fretting about not going to sleep, is effective.

Mulcahy is a house-bound widower who enjoys receiving a London Evening Standard from Cawley and having a chat for half-an-hour. After which, Cawley runs home again. Cawley is a member of the Good Gym, a not-for-profit organisation that encourages people to combine their exercise regime with a spot of social care, matching busy workers with elderly \"coaches\", who receive a daily paper or other modest delivery and, in turn, provide an incentive for their weekly visitors to keep on running. Set up two-and-a-half years ago, the Good Gym is this year expanding across all Olympic boroughs, part-funded by the Olympic Park Legacy Company. The Good Gym was the brainchild of Ivo Gormley, 29, who discovered that combining a weekly run with a visit to a housebound friend of the family was just the motivation he needed to keep him exercising; it helped that his elderly friend was a former boxer who could offer training tips. As Gormley did his prescribed situps, he thought about how best to link up a series of very modern disconnects: how few people have the time or energy to volunteer and yet use gyms to burn off excess energy; and how little dialogue there is between working people and the elderly, particularly in densely populated urban communities. \"Gyms are this ridiculous invention,\" says Gormley. \"People have got too much energy and go to these weird places where they get purged of it by machines. I thought we could channel the energy from people's exercise into something more productive.\" Through working with the NHS, charities and local community centres, including The Sundial Centre in Bethnal Green and Toynbee Hall, the Good Gym matches runners with an individual coach \u2013 a housebound elderly person who would like a regular visitor. They are encouraged to take a newspaper or a modest gift to the value of \u00a31. There are also monthly group runs around east London, to perform useful activities along the way. So far Good Gym members have distributed flyers for a local hospice, tidied up community gardens and hauled compost on to a school roof. Two runners are now being sought for a somewhat unusual task: taking donkeys from Stepney City Farm for a trot. (The donkeys need the exercise to keep their hooves down; donkey handling training will be provided.) Cawley, 38, a costume stylist, heard about the Good Gym through Twitter. \"It seemed such a brilliant idea,\" she says. It took four months for her to be checked by the Criminal Records Bureau (the Good Gym now uses a company to speed up this process and claims it takes just a couple of weeks), then she was assigned Mulcahy to run to, based on the distance she requested. Having a break in her running works well from a training point of view: she does a speed run to Mulcahy's house, rests there, then a does a more gentle, warm-down jog on the way home. Cawley is from Stockport and has no grandparents in London, so enjoys chatting to her elderly coach \u2013 \"someone I would never have met,\" she says. While the Good Gym advises runners to stay for about 10 minutes, Cawley sometimes chats to Mulcahy for an hour. Although he has family, and regular visits from professional carers, Cawley thinks he enjoys a visit from someone who does not worry like relatives and is not there out of professional duty. She didn't really know what he made of \"this random person turning up and chatting to him\" until she told him she was going away on holiday. \"He said: 'I'll really miss you.'\" Terry Duncan, 67, a retired printer from Stepney, uses an electric wheelchair after a stroke. He is regularly visited by Sally, another Good Gym member. \"It's lovely. I look forward to her coming,\" he says. He played football when he was younger, but is not sure how much use he is as a coach. \"I don't coach her,\" he says. What about a mid-run cup of tea? \"She normally has a glass of water. She's a bit hot and sweaty but sits down and has a chat. We've become good friends.\" Duncan has recommended the Good Gym to several immobile neighbours, but says they are \"a bit dubious about strangers coming into their house\". Despite these fears, the Good Gym is expanding, with interest in Edinburgh and a Good Gym run in Chicago. Most significant this year will be its Olympics expansion. As organisers hope the Games will leave a more enduring legacy in east London, Gormley wants his enterprise to become a social norm for the young professionals moving into the new housing around the Olympic Park. \"It's an amazing opportunity to shape the culture of a new area,\" he says. \"And link it to the existing community.\"",

The final draft of the new rules has been hastily put together with the aim of avoiding unwelcome headlines during next week's Cheltenham Festival, but it appears that jockeys' representatives and those running the sport are still not entirely on the same page. Discussions between the two sides continued on Sunday, after which Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, said: \"There is still one outstanding issue yet to be resolved. No decision has been taken one way or the other. In the interests of racing, we'll keep our counsel for the time being.\" It is now 16 months since the start of the Whip Review that began the recent series of changes to rules on this subject and since a final agreement on how they should read has yet to be achieved, it seems ambitious to expect that it might be before lunchtime on Monday. Yet that is when the British Horseracing Authority is due to issue what it hopes will be a final whip-related bulletin for many months to come. The aim is for the new rules to be implemented on Tuesday, giving stewards and jockeys a week to get used to them before the Festival. Racegoers at Leopardstown on Sunday were denied their annual dose of intrigue when the series of gallops by Cheltenham contenders that traditionally follows racing was drastically curtailed because of the drying ground. The surface, officially good, was deemed too fast by the trainers Noel Meade and Dessie Hughes, who opted not to risk their Festival-bound horses on it. Willie Mullins had taken a dozen horses 60 miles from his Carlow base and allowed them to canter round the circuit, but no fences were jumped. \"We've got them this far and can always do a bit more in the week,\" he said. \"From what they did, none of them appear to dislike the ground, which is encouraging. Raptor especially handled the good ground. The Midnight Club looked like he had lost a bit of enthusiasm but he got a bit of a fright at Aintree and maybe a day like this, pulling the arms out of his jockey, will bring him on.\" Paul Flynn also expressed enthusiasm about his County Hurdle entrant, Moon Dice, who worked with two horses from Dermot Weld's yard. The ground at Cheltenham has also been drying out and was good to firm in places on Sunday morning but 12mm of rain made it mostly good to soft and was welcomed by the clerk of the course, Simon Claisse. \"I'm very happy with where we are, with nine days to go,\" he said. A little more rain is forecast for Wednesday, at which point Claisse will decide whether further artificial irrigation is necessary to ensure a safe surface. Deacon Blues has been ruled out of action for the whole of 2012 after his trainer, James Fanshawe, discovered that the horse has a tendon injury. Now five, the gelding was named joint-champion sprinter of Europe last year after winning his last five races, though he never contested a Group One. The jockey Campbell Gillies, meanwhile, failed a breath test for alcohol before racing at Sedgefield and was prevented from taking his four mounts. He will now be referred to the BHA's disciplinary process.",

      "bodyText": "Thank you. Well, good morning, everyone. Rosy, thank you for your kind words. I have never seen Rosy on the basketball court. I'll bet it would be a treat. Rosy, you've been a dear friend of mine for a long time and a tireless advocate for the unbreakable bonds between Israel and the United States. And as you complete your term as president, I salute your leadership and your commitment. I want to thank the board of directors. As always, I'm glad to see my longtime friends in the Chicago delegation. I also want to thank the members of Congress who are with us here today, and who will be speaking to you over the next few days. You've worked hard to maintain the partnership between the United States and Israel. And I especially want to thank my close friend and leader of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. I'm glad that my outstanding young ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, is in the house. I understand that Dan is perfecting his Hebrew on his new assignment, and I appreciate his constant outreach to the Israeli people. And I'm also pleased that we're joined by so many Israeli officials, including Ambassador Michael Oren. And tomorrow, I'm very much looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Netanyahu and his delegation back to the White House. Every time I come to Aipac, I'm especially impressed to see so many young people here. You don't yet get the front seats I understand. You have to earn that. But students from all over the country who are making their voices heard and engaging deeply in our democratic debate. You carry with you an extraordinary legacy of more than six decades of friendship between the United States and Israel. And you have the opportunity and the responsibility to make your own mark on the world. And for inspiration, you can look to the man who preceded me on this stage, who's being honoured at this conference my friend, President Shimon Peres. Shimon was born a world away from here, in a shtetl in what was then Poland, a few years after the end of the first world war. But his heart was always in Israel, the historic homeland of the Jewish people. And when he was just a boy he made his journey across land and sea toward home. In his life, he has fought for Israel's independence, and he has fought for peace and security. As a member of the Haganah and a member of the Knesset, as a minister of defence and foreign affairs, as a prime minister and as president Shimon helped build the nation that thrives today: the Jewish state of Israel. But beyond these extraordinary achievements, he has also been a powerful moral voice that reminds us that right makes might not the other way around. Shimon once described the story of the Jewish people by saying it proved that, \"slings, arrows and gas chambers can annihilate man, but cannot destroy human values, dignity, and freedom\". And he has lived those values. He has taught us to ask more of ourselves and to empathise more with our fellow human beings. I am grateful for his life's work and his moral example. And I'm proud to announce that later this spring, I will invite Shimon Peres to the White House to present him with America's highest civilian honour the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In many ways, this award is a symbol of the broader ties that bind our nations. The United States and Israel share interests, but we also share those human values that Shimon spoke about: a commitment to human dignity. A belief that freedom is a right that is given to all of God's children. An experience that shows us that democracy is the one and only form of government that can truly respond to the aspirations of citizens. America's Founding Fathers understood this truth, just as Israel's founding generation did. President Truman put it well, describing his decision to formally recognise Israel only minutes after it declared independence. He said, \"I had faith in Israel before it was established. I believe it has a glorious future before it as not just another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.\" For over six decades, the American people have kept that faith. Yes, we are bound to Israel because of the interests that we share in security for our communities, prosperity for our people, the new frontiers of science that can light the world. But ultimately it is our common ideals that provide the true foundation for our relationship. That is why America's commitment to Israel has endured under Democratic and Republican presidents, and congressional leaders of both parties. In the United States, our support for Israel is bipartisan, and that is how it should stay. Aipac's work continually nurtures this bond. And because of Aipac's effectiveness in carrying out its mission, you can expect that over the next several days, you will hear many fine words from elected officials describing their commitment to the US-Israel relationship. But as you examine my commitment, you don't just have to count on my words. You can look at my deeds. Because over the last three years, as president of the United States, I have kept my commitments to the state of Israel. At every crucial juncture at every fork in the road we have been there for Israel. Every single time. Four years ago, I stood before you and said that, \"Israel's security is sacrosanct. It is non-negotiable.\" That belief has guided my actions as president. The fact is my administration's commitment to Israel's security has been unprecedented. Our military and intelligence cooperation has never been closer. Our joint exercises and training have never been more robust. Despite a tough budget environment, our security assistance has increased every single year. We are investing in new capabilities. We're providing Israel with more advanced technology the types of products and systems that only go to our closest friends and allies. And make no mistake: We will do what it takes to preserve Israel's qualitative military edge because Israel must always have the ability to defend itself, by itself, against any threat. This isn't just about numbers on a balance sheet. As a senator, I spoke to Israeli troops on the Lebanese border. I visited with families who've known the terror of rocket fire in Sderot. And that's why, as president, I have provided critical funding to deploy the Iron Dome system that has intercepted rockets that might have hit homes and hospitals and schools in that town and in others. Now our assistance is expanding Israel's defensive capabilities, so that more Israelis can live free from the fear of rockets and ballistic missiles. Because no family, no citizen, should live in fear. And just as we've been there with our security assistance, we've been there through our diplomacy. When the Goldstone report unfairly singled out Israel for criticism, we challenged it. When Israel was isolated in the aftermath of the flotilla incident, we supported them. When the Durban conference was commemorated, we boycotted it, and we will always reject the notion that Zionism is racism. When one-sided resolutions are brought up at the Human Rights Council, we oppose them. When Israeli diplomats feared for their lives in Cairo, we intervened to save them. When there are efforts to boycott or divest from Israel, we will stand against them. And whenever an effort is made to delegitimise the state of Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should not be a shred of doubt by now when the chips are down, I have Israel's back. Which is why, if during this political season you hear some questions regarding my administration's support for Israel, remember that it's not backed up by the facts. And remember that the US-Israel relationship is simply too important to be distorted by partisan politics. America's national security is too important. Israel's security is too important. Of course, there are those who question not my security and diplomatic commitments, but rather my administration's ongoing pursuit of peace between Israelis and Palestinians. So let me say this: I make no apologies for pursuing peace. Israel's own leaders understand the necessity of peace. Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defence Minister Barak, President Peres each of them have called for two states, a secure Israel that lives side by side with an independent Palestinian state. I believe that peace is profoundly in Israel's security interest. The reality that Israel faces from shifting demographics, to emerging technologies, to an extremely difficult international environment demands a resolution of this issue. And I believe that peace with the Palestinians is consistent with Israel's founding values because of our shared belief in self-determination, and because Israel's place as a Jewish and democratic state must be protected. Of course, peace is hard to achieve. There's a reason why it's remained elusive for six decades. The upheaval and uncertainty in Israel's neighbourhood makes it that much harder from the horrific violence raging in Syria, to the transition in Egypt. And the division within the Palestinian leadership makes it harder still most notably, with Hamas's continued rejection of Israel's very right to exist. But as hard as it may be, we should not and cannot give in to cynicism or despair. The changes taking place in the region make peace more important, not less. And I've made it clear that there will be no lasting peace unless Israel's security concerns are met. That's why we continue to press Arab leaders to reach out to Israel, and will continue to support the peace treaty with Egypt. That's why just as we encourage Israel to be resolute in the pursuit of peace we have continued to insist that any Palestinian partner must recognise Israel's right to exist and reject violence and adhere to existing agreements. And that is why my administration has consistently rejected any efforts to short-cut negotiations or impose an agreement on the parties. As Rosy noted, last year, I stood before you and pledged that, \"the United States will stand up against efforts to single Israel out at the United Nations\". As you know, that pledge has been kept. Last September, I stood before the United Nations General Assembly and reaffirmed that any lasting peace must acknowledge the fundamental legitimacy of Israel and its security concerns. I said that America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable, our friendship with Israel is enduring and that Israel must be recognised. No American president has made such a clear statement about our support for Israel at the United Nations at such a difficult time. People usually give those speeches before audiences like this one not before the General Assembly. And I must say, there was not a lot of applause. But it was the right thing to do. And as a result, today there is no doubt anywhere in the world that the United States will insist upon Israel's security and legitimacy. That will be true as we continue our efforts to pursue in the pursuit of peace. And that will be true when it comes to the issue that is such a focus for all of us today: Iran's nuclear program a threat that has the potential to bring together the worst rhetoric about Israel's destruction with the world's most dangerous weapons. Let's begin with a basic truth that you all understand: no Israeli government can tolerate a nuclear weapon in the hands of a regime that denies the Holocaust, threatens to wipe Israel off the map and sponsors terrorist groups committed to Israel's destruction. And so I understand the profound historical obligation that weighs on the shoulders of Bibi Netanyahu and Ehud Barak and all of Israel's leaders. A nuclear-armed Iran is completely counter to Israel's security interests. But it is also counter to the national security interests of the United States. Indeed, the entire world has an interest in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. A nuclear-armed Iran would thoroughly undermine the nonproliferation regime that we've done so much to build. There are risks that an Iranian nuclear weapon could fall into the hands of a terrorist organisation. It is almost certain that others in the region would feel compelled to get their own nuclear weapon, triggering an arms race in one of the world's most volatile regions. It would embolden a regime that has brutalised its own people, and it would embolden Iran's proxies, who have carried out terrorist attacks from the Levant to southwest Asia. And that is why, four years ago, I made a commitment to the American people and said that we would use all elements of American power to pressure Iran and prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon. And that is what we have done. When I took office, the efforts to apply pressure on Iran were in tatters. Iran had gone from zero centrifuges spinning to thousands, without facing broad pushback from the world. In the region, Iran was ascendant increasingly popular and extending its reach. In other words, the Iranian leadership was united and on the move, and the international community was divided about how to go forward. And so from my very first months in office, we put forward a very clear choice to the Iranian regime: a path that would allow them to rejoin the community of nations if they meet their international obligations, or a path that leads to an escalating series of consequences if they don't. In fact, our policy of engagement quickly rebuffed by the Iranian regime allowed us to rally the international community as never before, to expose Iran's intransigence and to apply pressure that goes far beyond anything that the United States could do on our own. Because of our efforts, Iran is under greater pressure than ever before. Some of you will recall, people predicted that Russia and China wouldn't join us to move toward pressure. They did. And in 2010 the UN Security Council overwhelmingly supported a comprehensive sanctions effort. Few thought that sanctions could have an immediate bite on the Iranian regime. They have, slowing the Iranian nuclear program and virtually grinding the Iranian economy to a halt in 2011. Many questioned whether we could hold our coalition together as we moved against Iran's Central Bank and oil exports. But our friends in Europe and Asia and elsewhere are joining us. And in 2012, the Iranian government faces the prospect of even more crippling sanctions. That is where we are today, because of our work. Iran is isolated, its leadership divided and under pressure. And by the way, the Arab Spring has only increased these trends, as the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime is exposed, and its ally, the Assad regime, is crumbling. Of course, so long as Iran fails to meet its obligations, this problem remains unresolved. The effective implementation of our policy is not enough we must accomplish our objective. And in that effort, I firmly believe that an opportunity still remains for diplomacy backed by pressure to succeed. The United States and Israel both assess that Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon, and we are exceedingly vigilant in monitoring their program. Now, the international community has a responsibility to use the time and space that exists. Sanctions are continuing to increase, and this July thanks to our diplomatic coordination a European ban on Iranian oil imports will take hold. Faced with these increasingly dire consequences, Iran's leaders still have the opportunity to make the right decision. They can choose a path that brings them back into the community of nations, or they can continue down a dead end. And given their history, there are, of course, no guarantees that the Iranian regime will make the right choice. But both Israel and the United States have an interest in seeing this challenge resolved diplomatically. After all, the only way to truly solve this problem is for the Iranian government to make a decision to forsake nuclear weapons. That's what history tells us. Moreover, as president and commander in chief, I have a deeply held preference for peace over war. I have sent men and women into harm's way. I've seen the consequences of those decisions in the eyes of those I meet who've come back gravely wounded, and the absence of those who don't make it home. Long after I leave this office, I will remember those moments as the most searing of my presidency. And for this reason, as part of my solemn obligation to the American people, I will only use force when the time and circumstances demand it. And I know that Israeli leaders also know all too well the costs and consequences of war, even as they recognise their obligation to defend their country. We all prefer to resolve this issue diplomatically. Having said that, Iran's leaders should have no doubt about the resolve of the United States just as they should not doubt Israel's sovereign right to make its own decisions about what is required to meet its security needs. I have said that when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, I will take no options off the table, and I mean what I say. That includes all elements of American power: a political effort aimed at isolating Iran, a diplomatic effort to sustain our coalition and ensure that the Iranian program is monitored, an economic effort that imposes crippling sanctions and, yes, a military effort to be prepared for any contingency. Iran's leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And as I have made clear time and again during the course of my presidency, I will not hesitate to use force when it is necessary to defend the United States and its interests. Moving forward, I would ask that we all remember the weightiness of these issues, the stakes involved for Israel, for America, and for the world. Already, there is too much loose talk of war. Over the last few weeks, such talk has only benefited the Iranian government, by driving up the price of oil, which they depend on to fund their nuclear program. For the sake of Israel's security, America's security and the peace and security of the world, now is not the time for bluster. Now is the time to let our increased pressure sink in and to sustain the broad international coalition we have built. Now is the time to heed the timeless advice from Teddy Roosevelt: Speak softly; carry a big stick. And as we do, rest assured that the Iranian government will know our resolve and that our coordination with Israel will continue. These are challenging times. But we've been through challenging times before, and the United States and Israel have come through them together. Because of our cooperation, citizens in both our countries have benefited from the bonds that bring us together. I'm proud to be one of those people. In the past, I've shared in this forum just why those bonds are so personal for me: the stories of a great uncle who helped liberate Buchenwald, to my memories of returning there with Elie Wiesel; from sharing books with President Peres to sharing seders with my young staff in a tradition that started on the campaign trail and continues in the White House; from the countless friends I know in this room to the concept of tikkun olam that has enriched and guided my life. As Harry Truman understood, Israel's story is one of hope. We may not agree on every single issue no two nations do, and our democracies contain a vibrant diversity of views. But we agree on the big things the things that matter. And together, we are working to build a better world one where our people can live free from fear; one where peace is founded upon justice; one where our children can know a future that is more hopeful than the present. There is no shortage of speeches on the friendship between the United States and Israel. But I'm also mindful of the proverb, \"A man is judged by his deeds, not his words\". So if you want to know where my heart lies, look no further than what I have done to stand up for Israel; to secure both of our countries and to see that the rough waters of our time lead to a peaceful and prosperous shore. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the people of Israel. God bless the United States of America.",

      "body": "<p>Thank you. Well, good morning, everyone.</p> <p>Rosy, thank you for your kind words. I have never seen Rosy on the basketball court. I'll bet it would be a treat. Rosy, you've been a dear friend of mine for a long time and a tireless advocate for the unbreakable bonds between Israel and the United States. And as you complete your term as president, I salute your leadership and your commitment.</p> <p>I want to thank the board of directors. As always, I'm glad to see my longtime friends in the Chicago delegation. I also want to thank the members of Congress who are with us here today, and who will be speaking to you over the next few days. You've worked hard to maintain the partnership between the United States and Israel. And I especially want to thank my close friend and leader of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p> <p>I'm glad that my outstanding young ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, is in the house. I understand that Dan is perfecting his Hebrew on his new assignment, and I appreciate his constant outreach to the Israeli people. And I'm also pleased that we're joined by so many Israeli officials, including Ambassador Michael Oren. And tomorrow, I'm very much looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Netanyahu and his delegation back to the White House.</p> <p>Every time I come to Aipac, I'm especially impressed to see so many young people here. You don't yet get the front seats I understand. You have to earn that. But students from all over the country who are making their voices heard and engaging deeply in our democratic debate. You carry with you an extraordinary legacy of more than six decades of friendship between the United States and Israel. And you have the opportunity and the responsibility to make your own mark on the world. And for inspiration, you can look to the man who preceded me on this stage, who's being honoured at this conference my friend, President Shimon Peres.</p> <p>Shimon was born a world away from here, in a shtetl in what was then Poland, a few years after the end of the first world war. But his heart was always in Israel, the historic homeland of the Jewish people. And when he was just a boy he made his journey across land and sea toward home.</p> <p>In his life, he has fought for Israel's independence, and he has fought for peace and security. As a member of the Haganah and a member of the Knesset, as a minister of defence and foreign affairs, as a prime minister and as president Shimon helped build the nation that thrives today: the Jewish state of Israel. But beyond these extraordinary achievements, he has also been a powerful moral voice that reminds us that right makes might not the other way around.</p> <p>Shimon once described the story of the Jewish people by saying it proved that, \"slings, arrows and gas chambers can annihilate man, but cannot destroy human values, dignity, and freedom\". And he has lived those values. He has taught us to ask more of ourselves and to empathise more with our fellow human beings. I am grateful for his life's work and his moral example. And I'm proud to announce that later this spring, I will invite Shimon Peres to the White House to present him with America's highest civilian honour the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p> <p>In many ways, this award is a symbol of the broader ties that bind our nations. The United States and Israel share interests, but we also share those human values that Shimon spoke about: a commitment to human dignity. A belief that freedom is a right that is given to all of God's children. An experience that shows us that democracy is the one and only form of government that can truly respond to the aspirations of citizens.</p> <p>America's Founding Fathers understood this truth, just as Israel's founding generation did. President Truman put it well, describing his decision to formally recognise Israel only minutes after it declared independence. He said, \"I had faith in Israel before it was established. I believe it has a glorious future before it as not just another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.\"</p> <p>For over six decades, the American people have kept that faith. Yes, we are bound to Israel because of the interests that we share in security for our communities, prosperity for our people, the new frontiers of science that can light the world. But ultimately it is our common ideals that provide the true foundation for our relationship. That is why America's commitment to Israel has endured under Democratic and Republican presidents, and congressional leaders of both parties. In the United States, our support for Israel is bipartisan, and that is how it should stay.</p> <p>Aipac's work continually nurtures this bond. And because of Aipac's effectiveness in carrying out its mission, you can expect that over the next several days, you will hear many fine words from elected officials describing their commitment to the US-Israel relationship. But as you examine my commitment, you don't just have to count on my words. You can look at my deeds. Because over the last three years, as president of the United States, I have kept my commitments to the state of Israel. At every crucial juncture at every fork in the road we have been there for Israel. Every single time.</p> <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and said that, \"Israel's security is sacrosanct. It is non-negotiable.\" That belief has guided my actions as president. The fact is my administration's commitment to Israel's security has been unprecedented. Our military and intelligence cooperation has never been closer. Our joint exercises and training have never been more robust. Despite a tough budget environment, our security assistance has increased every single year. We are investing in new capabilities. We're providing Israel with more advanced technology the types of products and systems that only go to our closest friends and allies. And make no mistake: We will do what it takes to preserve Israel's qualitative military edge because Israel must always have the ability to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.</p> <p>This isn't just about numbers on a balance sheet. As a senator, I spoke to Israeli troops on the Lebanese border. I visited with families who've known the terror of rocket fire in Sderot. And that's why, as president, I have provided critical funding to deploy the Iron Dome system that has intercepted rockets that might have hit homes and hospitals and schools in that town and in others. Now our assistance is expanding Israel's defensive capabilities, so that more Israelis can live free from the fear of rockets and ballistic missiles. Because no family, no citizen, should live in fear.</p> <p>And just as we've been there with our security assistance, we've been there through our diplomacy. When the Goldstone report unfairly singled out Israel for criticism, we challenged it. When Israel was isolated in the aftermath of the flotilla incident, we supported them. When the Durban conference was commemorated, we boycotted it, and we will always reject the notion that Zionism is racism.</p> <p>When one-sided resolutions are brought up at the Human Rights Council, we oppose them. When Israeli diplomats feared for their lives in Cairo, we intervened to save them. When there are efforts to boycott or divest from Israel, we will stand against them. And whenever an effort is made to delegitimise the state of Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should not be a shred of doubt by now when the chips are down, I have Israel's back.</p> <p>Which is why, if during this political season you hear some questions regarding my administration's support for Israel, remember that it's not backed up by the facts. And remember that the US-Israel relationship is simply too important to be distorted by partisan politics. America's national security is too important. Israel's security is too important.</p> <p>Of course, there are those who question not my security and diplomatic commitments, but rather my administration's ongoing pursuit of peace between Israelis and Palestinians. So let me say this: I make no apologies for pursuing peace. Israel's own leaders understand the necessity of peace. Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defence Minister Barak, President Peres each of them have called for two states, a secure Israel that lives side by side with an independent Palestinian state. I believe that peace is profoundly in Israel's security interest.</p> <p>The reality that Israel faces from shifting demographics, to emerging technologies, to an extremely difficult international environment demands a resolution of this issue. And I believe that peace with the Palestinians is consistent with Israel's founding values because of our shared belief in self-determination, and because Israel's place as a Jewish and democratic state must be protected.</p> <p>Of course, peace is hard to achieve. There's a reason why it's remained elusive for six decades. The upheaval and uncertainty in Israel's neighbourhood makes it that much harder from the horrific violence raging in Syria, to the transition in Egypt. And the division within the Palestinian leadership makes it harder still most notably, with Hamas's continued rejection of Israel's very right to exist.</p> <p>But as hard as it may be, we should not and cannot give in to cynicism or despair. The changes taking place in the region make peace more important, not less. And I've made it clear that there will be no lasting peace unless Israel's security concerns are met. That's why we continue to press Arab leaders to reach out to Israel, and will continue to support the peace treaty with Egypt. That's why just as we encourage Israel to be resolute in the pursuit of peace we have continued to insist that any Palestinian partner must recognise Israel's right to exist and reject violence and adhere to existing agreements. And that is why my administration has consistently rejected any efforts to short-cut negotiations or impose an agreement on the parties.</p> <p>As Rosy noted, last year, I stood before you and pledged that, \"the United States will stand up against efforts to single Israel out at the United Nations\". As you know, that pledge has been kept. Last September, I stood before the United Nations General Assembly and reaffirmed that any lasting peace must acknowledge the fundamental legitimacy of Israel and its security concerns. I said that America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable, our friendship with Israel is enduring and that Israel must be recognised. No American president has made such a clear statement about our support for Israel at the United Nations at such a difficult time. People usually give those speeches before audiences like this one not before the General Assembly.</p> <p>And I must say, there was not a lot of applause. But it was the right thing to do. And as a result, today there is no doubt anywhere in the world that the United States will insist upon Israel's security and legitimacy. That will be true as we continue our efforts to pursue in the pursuit of peace. And that will be true when it comes to the issue that is such a focus for all of us today: Iran's nuclear program a threat that has the potential to bring together the worst rhetoric about Israel's destruction with the world's most dangerous weapons.</p> <p>Let's begin with a basic truth that you all understand: no Israeli government can tolerate a nuclear weapon in the hands of a regime that denies the Holocaust, threatens to wipe Israel off the map and sponsors terrorist groups committed to Israel's destruction. And so I understand the profound historical obligation that weighs on the shoulders of Bibi Netanyahu and Ehud Barak and all of Israel's leaders.</p> <p>A nuclear-armed Iran is completely counter to Israel's security interests. But it is also counter to the national security interests of the United States.</p> <p>Indeed, the entire world has an interest in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. A nuclear-armed Iran would thoroughly undermine the nonproliferation regime that we've done so much to build.

      "bodyText": "There is the honours system; and then there is the real honours system, the one that shows beyond knighthoods or MBEs that you've really made it. That would include being invited on to Desert Island Discs, or in the old days having a latex of yourself on Spitting Image; or these days, being a real-life model for The Thick of It. In this world, Steve Hilton, the departing Number 10 ideas-guru, has certainly made it \u2013 though the satirical team which brought you Malcolm Tucker must be unhappy about his leaving, because they are supposed to start filming their new series about now and had been widely thought to have a Steve Hilton-style character taking a major role. Named Stewart Pearson, he featured in the last series, spouting phrases such as \"fractal retaliation\" and \"knowledge is porridge\". It is a big advantage to stand out from the crowd, and the real Hilton, with his bicycle, his aversion to wearing shoes, his baggy shorts and shaven head and addiction to trendy Californian verbiage, was an easy target. Now he's off to California itself with his wife, who works for Google; and the only thing you can't Google successfully is a clear answer as to why. These decisions are always a mix of personal and political, but Hilton's radicalism \u2013 particularly over the EU, where he has hardened his opposition \u2013 must have been badly frustrated by the politics of the coalition, and the anaesthetic effect of civil service advice. Blue-skies thinkers are welcome in opposition, and still welcome in the bold early days of any government; but then the cloud cover of administration and delivery rolls in. Maybe he'll come back for the election, maybe not; but for now Cameron has lost about the only person really close to him acknowledged to be a real radical, an instinctive outsider. Make no mistake: the exit of Hilton is an important moment in the slide of Cameron into fuzziness. And the more the prime minister protests, the more obvious it is. The first full year of the coalition brought real policy decisions, including the welfare changes, the disastrous NHS legislation, the Libyan escapade and, most notably, the Michael Gove education reforms. Like them or loathe them, you can hardly deny that ministers, even aside from the cuts, have been busy. But this, I think, is now over. The coalition is heading towards the second half of its administrative life in a condition of helpless drift. The reason is that both sides, Tory and Lib Dem, are playing a form of politics that requires them first and foremost to block the other. What has been sold as the supportive embrace of rivals in the national interest has turned into a frozen clinch. The NHS bill will probably go through, but has now been so amended \u2013 and may be further \u2013 that even senior former NHS bosses find it barely comprehensible. It is a bleeding, staggering, dazed example of what happens when a government is divided over its purpose. Now we will find much the same thing happening over the proposed House of Lords reforms. This time it's dissident Tory peers, not Lib Dem ones, who are determined to block the coalition proposals, and Lib Dems who are spitting with anger. Yet this could prove even more dangerous to the coalition than the NHS fiasco, because the battle in the Lords could well gum the place up so badly than nothing much else happens there for a year, including to any other legislation. Further, if the Lib Dem peer Matthew Oakeshott's threat to retaliate against Tory change-blockers by refusing to implement the Tory policy of a reduction in parliamentary seats is a real one, we'll see all-out war between the coalition partners. Speaking on a Guardian podcast last week, the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg spoke for many of his colleagues when he told me this was a naked Lib Dem power grab, trying to cement their slender hold on power by means of a PR-based second chamber. The most interesting and immediate problem, however, is over tax. There is clearly a deal waiting to be done. If the Lib Dems get their longstanding ambition for a mansion tax on houses worth more than \u00a32m through, by agreeing to the Tory instinct to cut the top 50p rate of income tax, both sides could claim victory. George Osborne would presumably square the circle by arguing that, since the top rate was bringing in so little money, the effect of the combined measures would be to tax the really rich more, not less. That would be, for the coalition, the sensible political course. But it would rob Nick Clegg of his most important popular proposal, a faster raising of the income tax threshold, to \u00a310,000. Could Osborne afford to deliver that and a 50p rate cut? If he went for the former and not the latter, he would face a huge wail of anger from the Tory right and from Tory backers. Were Osborne a Tory-only chancellor he would surely ditch the 50p rate, press down on tax avoidance (everyone agrees about that) and forget the mansion tax. It looks likelier that he'll produce a fudge \u2013 a bit more on thresholds, not much, and a mansion tax diluted enough to calm rich Tories \u2013 which pleases neither the tax-cutting Tory instincts nor the full \"fairness\" agenda of the Lib Dems. These are the dreary, inevitable compromises which clog up coalition politics and infuriate radical thinkers like Hilton. But being inevitable doesn't make them any less toxic. If the coalition is unable to find major measures to bring forward then it will find, like Labour in its later stages of political decay, that it gets diverted and its agenda is taken hostage. By what? In Labour's day sleaze, personality feuds in cabinet and minor scandals. Today, more likely by the desperate unfolding of the craven Tory relationship with Murdoch's tottering empire, police horses and all; by bitchy feuds between coalition parties; and by furious fights on second-order issues such as gay marriage. Day by day, vision and strategy are breaking down and being replaced by headline-management and tactics. To an extent, all democratic governments have this problem of arriving with one agenda and then finding they spend their time firefighting and dealing with unexpected tangles. Even so, we are clearly now into the decline of this government; and that is surely why the London Hilton is soon to become the LA Hilton. Twitter: @jackieashley",

That would include being invited on to Desert Island Discs, or in the old days having a latex of yourself on <a href=\"http://arts.theguardian.com/pictures/0,,1444231,00.html\" title=\"\">Spitting Image</a>; or these days, being a real-life model for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-thick-of-it\" title=\"\">The Thick of It</a>.</p> <p>In this world, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/02/david-cameron-steve-hilton-unpaid-leave?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Steve Hilton, the departing Number 10 ideas-guru</a>, has certainly made it \u2013 though the satirical team which brought you Malcolm Tucker must be unhappy about his leaving, because they are supposed to start filming their new series about now and had been widely thought to have a Steve Hilton-style character taking a major role. Named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2010/nov/01/stewart-pearson-thick-of-it\" title=\"\">Stewart Pearson</a>, he featured in the last series, spouting phrases such as \"fractal retaliation\" and \"knowledge is porridge\".</p> <p>It is a big advantage to stand out from the crowd, and the real Hilton, with his bicycle, his aversion to wearing shoes, his baggy shorts and shaven head and addiction to trendy Californian verbiage, was an easy target. Now he's off to California itself with his wife, who works for Google; and the only thing you can't Google successfully is a clear answer as to why.</p> <p>These decisions are always a mix of personal and political, but Hilton's radicalism \u2013 particularly over the EU, where he has hardened his opposition \u2013 must have been badly frustrated by the politics of the coalition, and the anaesthetic effect of civil service advice. Blue-skies thinkers are welcome in opposition, and still welcome in the bold early days of any government; but then the cloud cover of administration and delivery rolls in.</p> <p>Maybe he'll come back for the election, maybe not; but for now Cameron has lost about the only person really close to him acknowledged to be a real radical, an instinctive outsider. Make no mistake: the exit of Hilton is an important moment in the slide of Cameron into fuzziness. And the more the prime minister protests, the more obvious it is.</p> <p>The first full year of the coalition brought real policy decisions, including the welfare changes, the disastrous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/01/nhs-reform-bill-incoherent-doctors\" title=\"\">NHS legislation</a>, the Libyan escapade and, most notably, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove education reforms</a>. Like them or loathe them, you can hardly deny that ministers, even aside from the cuts, have been busy. But this, I think, is now over. The coalition is heading towards the second half of its administrative life in a condition of helpless drift. The reason is that both sides, Tory and Lib Dem, are playing a form of politics that requires them first and foremost to block the other. What has been sold as the supportive embrace of rivals in the national interest has turned into a frozen clinch.</p> <p>The NHS bill will probably go through, but has now been so amended \u2013 and may be further \u2013 that even senior former NHS bosses find it barely comprehensible. It is a bleeding, staggering, dazed example of what happens when a government is divided over its purpose. Now we will find much the same thing happening over the proposed House of Lords reforms. This time it's dissident Tory peers, not Lib Dem ones, who are determined to block the coalition proposals, and Lib Dems who are spitting with anger.</p> <p>Yet this could prove even more dangerous to the coalition than the NHS fiasco, because the battle in the Lords could well gum the place up so badly than nothing much else happens there for a year, including to any other legislation.</p> <p>Further, if the Lib Dem peer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/09/exit-lord-oakeshott-project-merlin\" title=\"\">Matthew Oakeshott</a>'s threat to retaliate against Tory change-blockers by refusing to implement the Tory policy of a reduction in parliamentary seats is a real one, we'll see all-out war between the coalition partners.

      "bodyText": "Saracens fly off to Abu Dhabi on Tuesday for one of their bonding sessions and one thing is certain. The weather will be better than it was in Watford. But on a wretched evening the champions lifted a cloud after two defeats to grind out a win that puts them within four points of the leaders, Harlequins. It was not easy on the eye but Saracens and England will be lifted by the sight of Charlie Hodgson returning to kick all 18 of their points in his comeback from the injury that kept him on the sidelines for the defeat by Wales. Northampton's points also all came from penalties, with the replacement Ryan Lamb giving them some consolation with a last-minute kick that gave the Saints a bonus point. Northampton are the form team of the Premiership but there was little else for the brave band of supporters who travelled down the M1 to get excited about, save for the warming sight of Tom Wood coming off the bench early in the second half. It was Wood's first action for two months after a toe injury that has kept him out of the England back row and maybe deprived him of the captaincy of Stuart Lancaster's side. Wood will join the England squad today, although he is unlikely to be in contention for England's game in Paris next Sunday. The Saracens chairman, Nigel Wray, in his programme notes, said he hoped it would be a lovely spring Vicarage Road afternoon. He may have been joking but it is clear Wray will not be the next John Kettley. All-day rain and sleet ensured that Hodgson, last seen playing on a skating rink in Rome, had to ply his trade on a quagmire. These sides are not known for their flowing rugby at the best of times and the conditions now made it look as if they had given up fizzing three-quarter moves for Lent. Hodgson and the Steve Borthwick returned to strengthen the side and, unsurprisingly, the game developed into an arm wrestle between the two packs with Hodgson and Stephen Myler exchanging a series of penalties. And although Borthwick may be in the autumn of his career, his presence always gives Saracens an extra solidity, particularly in the lineout. Northampton prefer the steady game of Myler at fly-half to that of Lamb nowadays, although Myler was off target with two of his kicks in a drab first half. Hodgson, who injured his finger in training after England's win in Italy, put Saracens ahead with his third penalty after James Downey failed to release the ball just before the break. There is not a lot of love lost between the clubs, a situation hardly improved by Saracens' signing of Chris Ashton, who joins the champions in the summer. Things were not too friendly on the pitch either as the packs found themselves embroiled in a brawl on the half-hour. These were not the conditions for Hodgson to thrive but after the interval he landed three more penalties, the first after the Saracens pack had driven forwards impressively in the mud and the Saints pulled down the maul. Myler landed another penalty but Saracens are adept at winning games even when they do not have much of the ball and Hodgson, who is the Premiership's highest points scorer, at least reminded Lancaster that he should be still in his thoughts when he picks his team for Paris. Mark McCall, the Saracens director of rugby, said: \"Charlie was outstanding today. It was not only his kicking which was flawless, it was his game management. He was terrific in difficult conditions. I don't think he'll play in Paris but all he can do is put his hand up and play like that and Charlie made a great case for his inclusion in the England side today.\" McCall confirmed that Peter Stringer, the former Ireland scrum-half who has been on loan for two months, is moving on for a loan spell to try to help Newcastle out of their relegation quagmire. But the England scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth may be fit by the time Saracens resume their European campaign against Clermont next month.

      "body": "<p>Saracens fly off to Abu Dhabi on Tuesday for one of their bonding sessions and one thing is certain. The weather will be better than it was in Watford. But on a wretched evening the champions lifted a cloud after two defeats to grind out a win that puts them within four points of the leaders, Harlequins.</p> <p>It was not easy on the eye but Saracens and England will be lifted by the sight of Charlie Hodgson returning to kick all 18 of their points in his comeback from the injury that kept him on the sidelines for the defeat by Wales. Northampton's points also all came from penalties, with the replacement Ryan Lamb giving them some consolation with a last-minute kick that gave the Saints a bonus point.</p> <p>Northampton are the form team of the Premiership but there was little else for the brave band of supporters who travelled down the M1 to get excited about, save for the warming sight of Tom Wood coming off the bench early in the second half. It was Wood's first action for two months after a toe injury that has kept him out of the England back row and maybe deprived him of the captaincy of Stuart Lancaster's side. Wood will join the England squad today, although he is unlikely to be in contention for England's game in Paris next Sunday.</p> <p>The Saracens chairman, Nigel Wray, in his programme notes, said he hoped it would be a lovely spring Vicarage Road afternoon. He may have been joking but it is clear Wray will not be the next John Kettley. All-day rain and sleet ensured that Hodgson, last seen playing on a skating rink in Rome, had to ply his trade on a quagmire.</p> <p>These sides are not known for their flowing rugby at the best of times and the conditions now made it look as if they had given up fizzing three-quarter moves for Lent. Hodgson and the Steve Borthwick returned to strengthen the side and, unsurprisingly, the game developed into an arm wrestle between the two packs with Hodgson and Stephen Myler exchanging a series of penalties. And although Borthwick may be in the autumn of his career, his presence always gives Saracens an extra solidity, particularly in the lineout.</p> <p>Northampton prefer the steady game of Myler at fly-half to that of Lamb nowadays, although Myler was off target with two of his kicks in a drab first half. Hodgson, who injured his finger in training after England's win in Italy, put Saracens ahead with his third penalty after James Downey failed to release the ball just before the break.</p> <p>There is not a lot of love lost between the clubs, a situation hardly improved by Saracens' signing of Chris Ashton, who joins the champions in the summer. Things were not too friendly on the pitch either as the packs found themselves embroiled in a brawl on the half-hour.</p> <p>These were not the conditions for Hodgson to thrive but after the interval he landed three more penalties, the first after the Saracens pack had driven forwards impressively in the mud and the Saints pulled down the maul. Myler landed another penalty but Saracens are adept at winning games even when they do not have much of the ball and Hodgson, who is the Premiership's highest points scorer, at least reminded Lancaster that he should be still in his thoughts when he picks his team for Paris.</p> <p>Mark McCall, the Saracens director of rugby, said: \"Charlie was outstanding today. It was not only his kicking which was flawless, it was his game management. He was terrific in difficult conditions. I don't think he'll play in Paris but all he can do is put his hand up and play like that and Charlie made a great case for his inclusion in the England side today.\"</p> <p>McCall confirmed that Peter Stringer, the former Ireland scrum-half who has been on loan for two months, is moving on for a loan spell to try to help Newcastle out of their relegation quagmire. But the England scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth may be fit by the time Saracens resume their European campaign against Clermont next month.</p> <p><strong>Saracens</strong> Goode; Taylor, Wyles, Powell, Short; Hodgson, Stringer (De Kock, 50); Gill (Smit, 58), Brits, Nieto (Stevens, 50), Borthwick (capt), Kruis (Vyvyan, 50), Melck, Saull, Joubert.</p> <p><strong>Pens</strong> Hodgson 6.</p> <p><strong>Northampton</strong> Diggin; Artemyev, Pisi, Downey (May, 75), Armstrong; Myler (Lamb, 75) Roberts; Tonga'Uiha (Waller, 68), Long (McMillan, 75), Doran-Jones (Mercey, 68), Manoa, Day (Sorenson, 75), Dowson (Wood, 57), Clark (capt), Wilson.</p> <p><strong>Pens</strong> Myler 3, Lamb.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> D Rose (Warwickshire). <strong>Attendance</strong> 6,044.</p>",

But what do you like? What do you think, or consume, or covet? And crucially, who cares? In real life, certain traits mark you out: your clothes, your hair, your choice of Mac or PC. You're easy to categorise into a tribe. And online you're increasingly even more textured, and more visible. And the people who care are not your friends or your mum, but people who sell things. Facebook is at the centre of the gold rush of marketing spend. Brands are piling on to the site, interacting with users and chummying up to potential customers. The brands are essentially \"like\"-farming. If you \"like\" their page, their news pops up on your news feed. The boundaries between personal and consumer are blurred. Frank Lampen, creative director at Independents United, a London-based agency that has pioneered the use of social media, says: \"Rather than a top-down advertising model, it's about an interactive, engaging, two-way communication channel.\" His clients include Asos and Vue Cinemas, and their Facebook pages are buzzing with people sharing views on clothes or films. Asos, an online-only UK retailer, has 1.6m likes. Even these UK success stories are dwarfed by the big names. Up there in the top 20 liked pages, alongside Facebook itself and Rihanna and Lady Gaga, is Coca-Cola, which more than 40 million people officially \"like\". According to allfacebook.com, which tracks \"likes\", Jesus was in the top 10 risers last week. But the Messiah has a long way to go to be more liked than Coke, or Starbucks, or even Burger King. Facebook last week held a conference in San Francisco for the burgeoning industry of third-party experts \u2013 the marketers and geeks that big brands bring in to boost the buzz on their pages. Your pootling about in cyberspace is someone else's marketing dream. It's easy to see what's in it for brands. The potential reach of their message is huge, measurable and all wrapped in the cuddly Facebook terminology of all-round mateyness; what you are seeing are recommendations from your friends. It makes the old days of billboards look like open heart surgery with a chainsaw. It's not entirely simple, however. Facebook employs proximity measures, which look at how actively you engage with a brand, before allowing the news to migrate over to your newsfeed. Yes, they're watching you. They're listening too. So-called \"listening platforms\" allow brands to monitor what people are saying about them across a range of social media. The proximity measures protect users from clogged newsfeeds, as only about 16% of fans get newsfeeds automatically. But they also give brands a reason to pay the company for its different forms of targeted advertising, rather than just relying on the free elements. Facebook earned around $3.15bn in advertising last year \u2013 and sponsored stories are increasingly used to direct people to brands' pages. Brands need to work hard to engage with consumers, partly to high-jump the proximity measures, but also because interaction is what works. They use Facebook apps; running games, promotions, giveaways and all manner of tricksy marketing ploys. Hence the blossoming of a new breed of specialist marketers. Never a breed to resist some jargon, they call it \"newsfeed optimisation\". Lampen says: \"The strategy is to constantly engage people, and the most important thing is content. At Asos, it's about highlighting new collections or designer collaborations.\" A report Facebook commissioned last month from the consultants Deloitte estimated that businesses are making $7.6bn a year across Europe piggybacking on Facebook. Nor is it the only network of interest; there's Twitter, Google+ and the new flavour of the month: Pinterest. But if it's obvious what's in it for them, what about us? Why are we so happy to be like-farmed? Ten minutes in the British Museum suggests some of the reasons: humans have always been identified by what they buy. Ever since Stig stepped out of his cave with a particularly on-trend club, the link between who we are and what we possess has been there. Brand adherence is a convenient shorthand to build up a projection of how we wish to be perceived. Boden or AllSaints? Guinness or WKD? I-stuff or I-not? Opting out is still a choice made with reference to that consumerist impulse. It makes perfect sense, then, to include our likes of big brands in our online identities. Technology is re-inventing a familiar wheel, and making it spin faster. If you don't want to be part of the consumerist game, don't hit \"like\". Except most of us are not so purist. We willingly surrender our privacy, our lists of friends and our affections. And they give us free stuff. What's not to like?",

      "bodyText": "It has launched Obama's re-election campaign, hosted powerful protest blogs and propelled hip young fashionistas and artists to fame and fortune. Blogging platform Tumblr \u2013 created by 25-year-old David Karp five years ago, and now valued at close to \u00a3500m \u2013 could be called Facebook's quietly prodigious cousin. Less showy, less of a brand and less well-known than its peers but quietly, doggedly keeping pace with them all: Tumblr now garners around 14bn page views a month, more than Wikipedia and more, even, than Twitter. A Tumblr page is a blank canvas. A post can be a picture, a song, a link, a video. Many of the most successful never post prose. The essence of a Tumblr blog, or \"tumblelog\", is freedom for self-expression. A great Tumblr post is reblogged again and again; it tumbles across continents and generations. No surprise then that tumblr is a new proving ground for aspiring writers, artists and comedians. Most comic content on Tumblr is in picture or video form. Clips and snaps of captioned cats and clothed dogs abound, as do photoshopped images and the latest instalments of ever-evolving online memes. The best make it on to the site's \"LOL\" feed, selected by Tumblr's 25-strong panel of \"LOL\" editors. All the editors are bloggers, and around half work as comedians or comedy writers. Some have hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers. For most users, Tumblr is an end in itself. Many funny tumblelogs \u2013 Garfield without Garfield, People Who, Hungover Owls \u2013 have become books and many tumbleloggers have gone on to become writers for TV. But most maintain their presence on Tumblr because it connects them directly with their audience. For the comedian, Tumblr, like Twitter, provides fast, quantifiable feedback. The number of times a post is liked or reblogged tells the poster precisely how funny they've just been. It's like being on stage as a standup \u2013 but with a 24-hour global audience. Like standups, some tumblelogs play to silence, some find a cult audience and the best are seen by millions: the digital equivalent of an arena tour. The arena-fillers tend to riff on a simple theme: why does Nick Clegg look sad? How do gullible conservatives react to The Onion? What might this cat be saying? Any list that purports to collect \"the funniest\" anything will amuse and enrage in equal measure. Lovers of omitted contenders, and haters of those included, will howl in indignation. Apologies in advance. Here, nonetheless, is a pick of 10 of the funniest. Notes to My Future Husband This one might be a little divisive. Notes To My Future Husband tends to provoke howls of recognition from women but \u2013 speaking from personal experience \u2013 can just as often induce in men a short and embarrassing guilty silence. Not just a place to come and laugh then \u2013 also a place for serially bad boyfriends to come and learn something. By category: \"GIRLFRIENDS \u2013 Treat mine well. They know more about you than you can possibly imagine.\" \"BACON \u2013 Bring home the bacon. Literally. I love bacon. That shit is delicious.\" People Who A guide to the worst people in the world as identified by their actions. This website may be the most important and comprehensive manual of contemporary manners and morality we have. If you manage to read to the end without once thinking \"I'm one of those people\" then odds are you're doing OK at life. At the very least, don't be one of the people \"who sit at library computers for hours but never seem to leave Facebook\", \"repeatedly shout out the same incorrect word during Pictionary\", or, worst of all, \"start the standing ovation\". I Love Charts This combines the plain hilarious with the simply fascinating. Taking entries from all over the internet and beyond, an ILC post can be anything from a 19th-century pie chart to a hand-drawn Venn diagram, and will almost always raise either a laugh or an eyebrow. For people who see the funny in a bar chart titled \"Frequency of Lying\" that spikes at \"I have read and agreed to the Terms of Service,\" or a colour-coded map of the US titled: \"Classification of young American females according to Brian Wilson\". Literally Unbelievable OK, so it's not strictly a Tumblr. Literally Unbelievable chronicles the po-faced responses of gullible Facebook users to articles from satirical newspaper the Onion, providing both a dose of funny and a feeling of superiority. One classic, from a user responding to an article titled \"Brain-Dead Teen, Only Capable Of Rolling Eyes And Texting, To Be Euthanized\": \"You need to contact your congressman and tell him to put a stop to this. Why isn't the media covering this?\" We can only hope the congressman contacted took it as seriously. Clients From Hell This one's strictly for the computer-literate. If you know your PDFs from your JPEGs, it's a riot. If you don't, you're likely to end up cringing in self-recognition. It collects email, phone and text exchanges between freelancers and their dim-witted clients, with most of the humour centring around the misguided requests of the digitally challenged. Case in point: \"I've decided on the photos that I would like you to use on the website. They are attached to this email. Please send them back when you're finished as they are my only copies. Thanks!\" Nick Clegg Looking Sad Downhearted deputy PM Nick Clegg may be the defining image of the coalition but what really makes this Tumblr is its captions. Each post is a miniature masterclass in observational comedy. Favourites include: \"Nick Clegg pressed '300' instead of '30' at the cash machine and now he has to carry loads of money around,\" and \"Nick Clegg said something stupid as a joke, but then someone pointed out how stupid it was as though it wasn't a joke, and now everyone thinks he's stupid and it's too late to say it was a joke all along.\" Animals Doing People Things This one's for the non-readers. With no captions or speech bubbles on the images, this self-explanatory blog offers laughs at a glance. Just don't be surprised to wake from a half-hour trance having clicked through every one of its 42 pages. Typical posts include a miniature schnauzer at a desk, a husky pup in glasses peering over a well-pawed novel and a crab with a cigarette. Oh, and so many waving bears that you will begin to wonder whether they are actually waving to each other. Hungover Owls Journalist J Patrick Brown struck gold combining the things we say when we're hungover with, well, owls. It turns out that when an owl squints, stares, hunches or just closes its eyes it bears a striking resemblance to a drinker on the morning after the night before. The crude and sweary captions should be achingly familiar to anyone who has ever woken up with \u2013 as Withnail puts it \u2013 a bastard behind the eyes. Classic line: \"If I can get more than half of my costume off by noon, then today counts as a victory.\" Garfield Minus Garfield The name says it all. Garfield Minus Garfield strips the cat out of the comic strip, leaving nothing but three panels of a lonely Jon Arbuckle. In the words of the site's creator, Dan Walsh: \"It is a journey deep into the mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness and depression in a quiet American suburb.\" Rarely laugh-out-loud funny, but there's something inherently comic about a recurring cartoon-cat-shaped lacuna. Even Garfield's original creator is a fan. Food On My Dog In comedy, the simplest ideas tend to be the best: what if I skip with my arms by my sides? What if, instead of four candles, I want fork handles? Or, as in this case, what if I put food on my dog's head? The makers of this Tumblr do just that with their faithful and patient four-legged friend Tiger, posting a new photo with a new piece of food-based headwear every day. Recent choices include a fortune cookie, an onion and a stick of candy floss. Tiger is fine with it, apparently.",

Here, nonetheless, is a pick of 10 of the funniest.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://tomyhusband.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Notes to My Future Husband</a></h2> <p>This one might be a little divisive. Notes To My Future Husband tends to provoke howls of recognition from women but \u2013 speaking from personal experience \u2013 can just as often induce in men a short and embarrassing guilty silence. Not just a place to come and laugh then \u2013 also a place for serially bad boyfriends to come and learn something. By category: \"GIRLFRIENDS \u2013 Treat mine well. They know more about you than you can possibly imagine.\" \"BACON \u2013 Bring home the bacon. Literally. I love bacon. That shit is delicious.\"</p> <h2><a href=\"http://peoplewho.us/\" title=\"\">People Who</a></h2> <p> A guide to the worst people in the world as identified by their actions. This website may be the most important and comprehensive manual of contemporary manners and morality we have. If you manage to read to the end without once thinking \"I'm one of those people\" then odds are you're doing OK at life. At the very least, don't be one of the people \"who sit at library computers for hours but never seem to leave Facebook\", \"repeatedly shout out the same incorrect word during Pictionary\", or, worst of all, \"start the standing ovation\".</p> <h2><a href=\"http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">I Love Charts</a></h2> <p> This combines the plain hilarious with the simply fascinating. Taking entries from all over the internet and beyond, an ILC post can be anything from a 19th-century pie chart to a hand-drawn Venn diagram, and will almost always raise either a laugh or an eyebrow. For people who see the funny in a&#xa0;bar chart titled \"Frequency of Lying\" that spikes at \"I have read and agreed to the Terms of Service,\" or a colour-coded map of the US titled: \"Classification of young American females according to Brian Wilson\".</p> <h2><a href=\"http://literallyunbelievable.org/\" title=\"\">Literally Unbelievable</a></h2> <p>OK, so it's not strictly a Tumblr. Literally Unbelievable chronicles the po-faced responses of gullible Facebook users to articles from satirical newspaper the Onion, providing both a dose of funny and a feeling of superiority. One classic, from a user responding to an article titled \"Brain-Dead Teen, Only Capable Of Rolling Eyes And Texting, To Be Euthanized\": \"You need to contact your congressman and tell him to put a stop to this. Why isn't the media covering this?\" We can only hope the congressman contacted took it as seriously.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://clientsfromhell.net/\" title=\"\">Clients From Hell</a></h2> <p> This one's strictly for the computer-literate. If you know your PDFs from your JPEGs, it's a riot. If you don't, you're likely to end up cringing in self-recognition. It collects email, phone and text exchanges between freelancers and their dim-witted clients, with most of the humour centring around the misguided requests of the digitally challenged. Case in point: \"I've decided on the photos that I would like you to use on the website. They are attached to this email. Please send them back when you're finished as they are my only copies. Thanks!\"</p> <h2><a href=\"http://nickclegglookingsad.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg Looking Sad</a></h2> <p>Downhearted deputy PM Nick Clegg may be the defining image of&#xa0;the coalition but what really makes this Tumblr is its captions. Each post is a miniature masterclass in observational comedy. Favourites include: \"Nick Clegg pressed '300' instead of '30' at the cash machine and now he has to carry loads of money around,\" and \"Nick Clegg said something stupid as a joke, but then someone pointed out how stupid it was as though it wasn't a joke, and now everyone thinks he's stupid and it's too late to say it was a joke all along.\"</p> <h2><a href=\"http://animalsthatdopeoplethings.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Animals Doing People Things</a></h2> <p>This one's for the non-readers. With&#xa0;no captions or speech bubbles on the images,&#xa0;this self-explanatory blog offers laughs at a glance. Just don't be surprised to wake from a half-hour trance having clicked through every one of its 42 pages. Typical posts include a miniature schnauzer at a desk, a&#xa0;husky pup in glasses peering over a well-pawed novel and a crab with a cigarette. Oh, and so many waving bears that you will begin to wonder whether they are actually waving to&#xa0;each&#xa0;other.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://hungoverowls.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Hungover Owls</a></h2> <p>Journalist J Patrick Brown struck gold combining the things we say when we're hungover with, well, owls. It turns out that when an owl squints, stares, hunches or just closes its eyes it bears a striking resemblance to a drinker on the morning after the night before. The crude and sweary captions should be achingly familiar to anyone who has ever woken up with \u2013 as Withnail puts it \u2013 a bastard behind the eyes. Classic line: \"If I can get more than half of my costume off by noon, then today counts as&#xa0;a&#xa0;victory.\"</p> <h2><a href=\"http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/\" title=\"\">Garfield Minus Garfield</a></h2> <p>The name says it all. Garfield Minus Garfield strips the cat out of the comic strip, leaving nothing but three panels of a lonely Jon Arbuckle. In the words of the site's creator, Dan Walsh: \"It is a journey deep into the mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness and depression in a quiet American suburb.\" Rarely laugh-out-loud funny, but there's something inherently comic about a recurring&#xa0;cartoon-cat-shaped lacuna. Even Garfield's original creator is a&#xa0;fan.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://foodonmydog.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Food On My Dog</a> </h2> <p>In comedy, the simplest ideas tend&#xa0;to be the best: what if I skip&#xa0;with my arms by my sides? What if, instead of four candles, I want fork handles? Or, as in this case, what if I put food on my dog's&#xa0;head? The makers of this Tumblr do just that with their faithful and patient four-legged friend Tiger, posting a new photo&#xa0;with a new piece of food-based headwear every&#xa0;day. Recent&#xa0;choices include a&#xa0;fortune cookie, an onion and a stick of candy floss. Tiger is fine with it,&#xa0;apparently.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When I was a police constable in the late 1970s there used to be a fight every Friday night outside the Irish dancehall in the Holloway Road in north London. We would go up to the combatants and shout \"police\". Everyone stopped and we would arrest the worst offenders. Twenty years later, when girls from rival schools were confronting each other in Wimbledon Broadway, I asked a 16-year-old girl to move on. I was in full uniform. She looked me in the eye and said \"no\". The British tradition of policing by consent, rather than by force and weight of numbers, is being eroded, and plans to use private security firms to carry out core policing tasks, as reported this weekend, will accelerate that process. I arrested hundreds of people in my 30-plus year career in the Metropolitan Police. Most of them, back in the day, were easy. We had the support and co-operation of the public, including most of the criminals. In those days there was time to sympathise with the burglary victim, to talk to young people hanging around the estates and to sit and wait for the inevitable fight in the Holloway Road. On one occasion, my police radio was not working. As I struggled to detain the man I had arrested for criminal damage, a member of the public dialled 999 for me. But it was not like that everywhere. I went from Holloway to Brixton in south London where, unless it was clear your arrest was necessary, the crowd that always gathered out of curiosity would rescue your prisoner from you. Certain communities no longer trust the police and giving roles that are central to building public trust and confidence, such as investigation and patrol, to private security companies, carries with it the danger of undermining public trust and confidence among even more people. I believe even police community support officers were a mistake. They are said to be fulfilling two roles; being the eyes and ears of the police, and being a bridge between the police and the community. The model of policing by consent, upon which the whole system of British policing is based, has, at its heart, people like you and me being the eyes and ears of the police. The model of policing by consent has the police and the people standing together against the criminal, sharing information, working together to reduce crime. If we need a bridge between the police and the community something is going seriously wrong, and if we put anyone between the police and the community, we undermine police-community relations. If the new proposal means you will not see police officers on routine patrol, you will not even see a police officer if your home is burgled, but you see a security officer instead, vital opportunities to reinforce or, in an increasing number of cases, rebuild the unwritten contract between the police and the public, will be lost. Police officers are very expensive to run \u2013 the cost of their training, pay and equipment is high, but they have a very difficult and dangerous job to do, as the tragic case of David Rathband showed last week. The office of constable is unique in that he or she exercises force on our behalf, whether making an arrest, using a baton or even firing a gun. No one can tell a police officer to arrest someone \u2013 no politician, no senior police officer, no member of the public \u2013 and that police officer is accountable only to the law for exercising that force. Police officers have an enormous amount of power and an enormous amount of discretion in how they use that power. Are we seriously talking about routinely giving that power to security officers? Why did the previous Labour government agree to police community support officers? Because they saw them as a cheaper alternative to police officers, not realising they could potentially undermine policing by consent. Cuts can and should be made. First- and business-class travel, chauffeur-driven cars and luxury London accommodation for senior police officers have to go; but break down policing by consent, and a French-style system of policing by force, with many more police officers than we currently have, will cost us much, much more in the long run. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

Then he said: 'By the way, what can you tell us about Latino gangs?'\" Meet the Latin American community in the UK. The vast majority \u2013 probably about 113,000, is in London. But we hardly notice it. It's a composite; people from countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, Peru, Chile and Argentina. It's a young community. Well educated, 70% beyond secondary level. English can initially be a problem. Even so, consider that they are 10 times more likely to work for less than the minimum wage. Meet the invisibles.

      "bodyText": "Introducing secret hearings into civil courts could backfire, leading to more claimants accessing sensitive information, according to the government's own impact assessment of its justice and security green paper. Expanding the use of so-called \"closed material proceedings\" (CMPs) may also result in jurors finding the vetting procedure intrusive, and in \"resentment of the judicial process and unwillingness to participate in jury service\", the Ministry of Justice's study warns. The highly critical comments are buried deep in the department's own appraisal of the measures, which are intended to protect national security. They are in sharp contrast to the upbeat public endorsement given by the justice secretary, Ken Clarke. When he presented the green paper to parliament, Clarke declared: \"[We] seek to produce a system whereby our public and our allies can be reassured that these matters will be handled sensitively in this country. People will share intelligence with us knowing that it will be used properly, will not be misused and will not be disclosed in areas where it would do damage.\" But the MoJ's less widely circulated impact assessment cautions that there is a \"higher risk of potential security breaches due to a larger number of individuals accessing sensitive information \u2026 [and] any potential breaches may impose substantial costs to UK security\". Clarke is to appear before parliament's joint committee on human rights on Tuesday to face questions about the proposals, which go far beyond the existing public interest immunity certificates used in cases involving MI5, MI6 or Special Branch. The civil liberties group Reprieve, which has campaigned on behalf of detainees who have been secretly \"rendered\" to overseas prisons, highlighted the critical comments in the impact assessment document. It has accused the government of \"sleepwalking into a system of secret courts\". British courts are already well equipped to deal with national security cases, it insists. \"To claim otherwise is to allow our government's addiction to secrecy to erode centuries-old traditions of open justice.\" The justice and security green paper is aimed at closing down embarrassing public actions brought against the intelligence agencies by former terrorist suspects such as Binyam Mohamed, a British citizen held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, who claimed he was tortured while detained in jails, including in US custody. Under the proposals, not only would ministers be able to order a hearing to be conducted in secret, but the proceedings would also deny claimants access to government evidence or witnesses \u2013 leaving them effectively untested in court. In addition, the final judgment could be wholly or partially withheld. There have been 90 submissions in response to the green paper, of which 77 have been published on the Cabinet Office website. Among the latest releases is the response of the Police Federation, which warns that CMPs should be used only in \"exceptional cases\". It adds: \"There is clearly a disadvantage to excluded individuals from CMPs, and a risk to the interests of justice.\" But a number of the organisations, including several police forces, appear reluctant to reveal their comments . Lancashire, Kent and Essex Police have been asked, on a number of occasions, to make their submissions public, but have failed to respond. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: \"In the interests of ensuring maximum transparency, we are actively seeking consent to publish as many responses as possible. Even in cases where consent is withheld we are proposing to publish a summary that reflects the full range of responses received. Separately, a very small number of responses were submitted in confidence. The government is under a legal duty to respect that.\" Of the remaining unpublished submissions, seven are individual members of the public, three are police or law-enforcement bodies, two are private companies and one is a public oversight body. Among others to voice concern about the proposals is the former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald. He warned earlier this week: \"These unprecedented proposals are an audacious attack on the fundamental principle of British justice: that you should be able to know, and to challenge, the claims which are made against you.\" \"They threaten to put the government above the law, while leaving ordinary citizens, and the press, shut out of their own justice system. After a decade in which we have seen our politicians and officials caught up in the woeful abuses of the War on Terror, the last thing the Government should be seeking is to sweep all of this under the carpet. However, that is exactly what their disastrous secret justice proposals are likely to do. \"David Cameron came to power saying 'sunlight is the best disinfectant'. We should not sacrifice Britain's open and transparent justice system simply to protect politicians and their officials from embarrassment.\"",

      "bodyText": "The problems are piling up for St Helens, who have now gone three games without a win after being pipped 17-16 in a thriller at Huddersfield, and also have a major injury concern over James Roby. The England hooker collapsed in pain after being tackled in the 27th minute, and although he tried to play on, he soon had to be helped from the field. \"He's got a leg muscle injury which seems to be pretty nasty,\" was the vague initial diagnosis from the Saints coach, Royce Simmons, whose team had suffered another narrow defeat by the Catalan Dragons last week after previously drawing at Hull KR. \"We'll probably get a scan and see where we go from there but it doesn't look too good. It's probably a few weeks job. He doesn't come off too easy.\" Luke George and Danny Brough were the heroes of a win that lifts Huddersfield to joint second in the table with Wigan, one point behind Warrington. George scored his second hat-trick in five matches this season, but Brough's drop-goal was the difference between the teams, and the scrum-half also converted George's third try from the touchline, although only after a rebound from both posts and the crossbar. Nathan Brown, the Huddersfield coach who has been tipped to succeed Simmons at St Helens next season, sent his assistant, Paul Anderson, to the post-match press conference. Both Hull clubs had home wins on a distinctly wintry afternoon on the east coast, although the margins were very different. Hull KR thrashed Widnes 36-0, with Craig Hall, a utility back who had a loan spell with the Cheshire club last season, scoring two of their six tries. \"Those conditions were absolutely horrendous,\" said Craig Sandercock, the Australian who joined Rovers as coach from Newcastle Knights during the winter. \"They didn't tell me about those when I was on a beach in Newcastle.\" He said that Shannon McDonnell, the Rovers full-back, \"looked like a drowned cat\". Hull FC were given a much tougher test by Wakefield Trinity, whose coach, Richard Agar, praised his players for a fightback which had his former employers clinging on to a 14-10 lead. \"We finished the stronger side and the players felt if it had gone on another minute or two longer, we would have won the game,\" said Agar. The England forwards James Graham and Gareth Ellis both enjoyed victories in Sydney on the opening weekend of the National Rugby League season. Graham won rave reviews for making 51 tackles on his Canterbury debut against Penrith, but Ellis said he would \"never complain about an English winter again\" after Wests Tigers saw off Cronulla 17-16 in extra time in ferociously hot and humid conditions. It sounds like he might have changed his mind had he been in Hull.",

Hull KR thrashed <strong>Widnes</strong> 36-0, with Craig Hall, a utility back who had a loan spell with the Cheshire club last season, scoring two of their six tries. \"Those conditions were absolutely horrendous,\" said Craig Sandercock, the Australian who joined Rovers as coach from <strong>Newcastle Knights</strong> during the winter. \"They didn't tell me about those when I was on a beach in Newcastle.\"</p> <p>He said that Shannon McDonnell, the Rovers full-back, \"looked like a drowned cat\". <strong>Hull FC</strong> were given a much tougher test by <strong>Wakefield Trinity</strong>, whose coach, Richard Agar, praised his players for a fightback which had his former employers clinging on to a 14-10 lead. \"We finished the stronger side and the players felt if it had gone on another minute or two longer, we would have won the game,\" said Agar.</p> <p>The England forwards James Graham and Gareth Ellis both enjoyed victories in Sydney on the opening weekend of the National Rugby League season. Graham won rave reviews for making 51 tackles on his <strong>Canterbury</strong> debut against Penrith, but Ellis said he would \"never complain about an English winter again\" after <strong>Wests Tigers</strong> saw off <strong>Cronulla</strong> 17-16 in extra time in ferociously hot and humid conditions. It sounds like he might have changed his mind had he been in Hull.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the story is told of this season's title race, Manchester United may look back on this victory and cherish it as one of the key assignments they completed. Sir Alex Ferguson's team have reminded Manchester City of their staying power and now have an obliging run of fixtures before the top two meet on 30 April in a coming together that may determine the final location of the Premier League trophy. Seven of United's eight games before then are against teams from the bottom half of the league and Ferguson's men increasingly offer the sense of a side who have been here before, are building momentum and know exactly what has to be done. They have played more cohesively at times this season, have passed the ball better and operated with a greater sense of control, but there was still something to admire about the way they could dismantle the team in third position, while always giving the impression they were a good notch or two below their best. For long spells, particularly in the first half, they were actually pinned back and United were fortunate to be ahead at half-time. And when the lead stretched to 3-0 it was totally out of keeping with how much of the game had gone. Yet it is no fluke that this team are able to soak up so much pressure and then go to other end of the pitch and punish opponents for not making the most of their possession. These are the qualities \u2013 perseverance, know-how, longevity \u2013 of serial champions. \"We dominated them, we were better than them,\" Harry Redknapp, the Spurs manager, said. \"I've never seen Alex on his feet so much, out of the dugout, for years.\" Yet it was a familiar smile on Ferguson's face by the end, reflecting on a satisfying way to overtake Sir Matt Busby with his 986th league game in charge. The game turned a minute before half-time, when Wayne Rooney headed in Ashley Young's corner. Until then Spurs had been pressing forward, with Louis Saha and Emmanuel Adebayor elusive opponents. Jake Livermore and Sandro were not letting Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick dictate the tempo in midfield, and there were few signs the home side were missing the suspended Scott Parker, the injured Rafael van der Vaart and the ill Gareth Bale. Yet Kyle Walker, marking Rooney, let him go and at this level those lapses can be so telling. United made the most of their good fortune, David de Gea saved brilliantly when Livermore's 52nd-minute shot took a deflection off Adebayor and when they had their first spell of concerted pressure it was devastating, Young scoring with two right-foot finishes in the space of nine minutes. The first was clinical, struck diagonally across the face of goal, left to right, after Walker had taken a chance off Rooney's toe. The second was even better, struck from almost 30 yards, curling, dipping and swerving into the top corner. Young had endured a poor half and his form for United has been erratic, but this should give him a new wave of confidence. Once his second effort had arrowed beyond Brad Friedel there was never any real possibility that Spurs could prevent their winless sequence against United stretching to a 26th game. It is some run since that last victory, dating back to May 2001 when Willem Khorsten and Les Ferdinand were the scorers. Of greater importance to Redknapp, they have now taken only eight points from their last seven games. Arsenal, in fourth position, are now only four points below them. Spurs will reflect on that moment, after 37 minutes, when Adebayor flicked the ball into an exposed net only for the referee, Martin Atkinson, to rule it out for handball. It was a marginal decision, but probably the correct one. Adebayor had been on the goal-line when Saha's effort struck him in the stomach and bounced into his left arm. Redknapp described it as \"harsh\" but did not dwell on it too long, talking more about the individual mistakes for United's goals. As well as Walker's culpability for the Rooney header, the Spurs manager felt Luka Modric had \"gone to sleep\" in the build-up to Young's first. Ferguson will not be entirely satisfied when a careless pass from Ryan Giggs allowed Jermain Defoe to score with a powerful right-foot drive two minutes before the end. Yet, by then, the champions had already demonstrated how difficult it is going to be for City to shake them off. Man of the match Jonny Evans (Manchester United)",

Pavel Pogrebnyak, their January deadline-day replacement for the QPR striker, probably needs the nickname. But as Wolverhampton Wanderers will attest, he is a handful as well as a mouthful. The Russia striker, who is on a short-term contract from Stuttgart until the end of the season, when he becomes a free agent, reinforced the impression that he is made to measure for the Premier League. Having scored vital goals in his first two games \u2013 the wins over Stoke and Queens Park Rangers \u2013 he plundered a hat-trick that sank Wolves and managed to emboss his fine performance of power and finesse. It has been difficult to reconcile his toils at Stuttgart. Fulham leapt from 13th to eighth and they might have reflected that the last time they won three league matches in a row, they narrowly avoided relegation to the Championship at the end of 2007-08. They are a different proposition these days, bristling with verve and attacking intent under Martin Jol. The drop, though, was a principal plot-line because, in simple terms, if Terry Connor's Wolves play and, in particular, defend like this for the remainder of the season, they will be relegated. This was an afternoon for them to stand up and be counted, with most of the ingredients in place for a dogfight. Yet, as the rain fell and the wind whipped off the Thames, they disappeared without trace. Fulham could have reached double figures. Wayne Hennessey made smart saves when the game was goalless; Andrew Johnson, who set up two and also hit the crossbar, did everything but score and Fulham created chances almost at will towards the end. Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, the striker deployed in central midfield, was excellent, wowing the crowd with his skills, while Clint Dempsey has now scored 18 goals in all competitions, which is some return for a wide player. The American is so underrated that he is in danger of becoming overrated. The day belonged to Pogrebnyak, who enjoyed a tremendous ovation when he was substituted but for Wolves it was a day of soul searching. The travelling fans celebrated Jamie O'Hara's on-target 90th-minute shot with ironic cheers. Connor, asked to perform the salvage operation after the ham-fisted failure to appoint an external successor to the sacked manager Mick McCarthy, attempted to put the drubbing down to a few of lapses and a subsequent desire to chase the game. He repeatedly mentioned Fulham's third as the turning point and he even claimed that until then his team had \"a platform to grab a goal back\". In his first game in charge, at Newcastle United, they had recovered from 2-0 down to draw but a repeat never looked likely. This was a dismal game for Wolves in which there were only negatives, including Karl Henry's withdrawal with a hamstring injury. Connor's post-match fighting talk has to be heeded. \"We are always going to get a bloody nose every now and again,\" he said. \"It's how we bounce back.\" Wolves entertain Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. It was gruesome to watch Wolves' defending, beginning with the opening goal, when the hulking Pogrebnyak was ignored at Damien Duff's disputed corner. Kevin Foley played Richard Stearman into trouble on the second \u2013 Johnson broke swiftly to cut back for Pogrebnyak \u2013 while the third saw Danny Murphy's low pass carve apart Wolves and Dempsey finished coolly, as he did for the fifth, from Mahamadou Diarra's ball. Pogrebnyak got his hat-trick after Hennessey parried Johnson's shot. When Wolves wake up, they will find themselves back in the bottom three. Man of the match Pavel Pogrebnyak (Fulham)",

      "bodyText": "Senior police officers have strongly defended the radical extension of the role of private companies in policing, saying they should be involved in protecting the public and bringing offenders to justice. The comments from the Association of Chief Police Officers follow the disclosure by the Guardian that the West Midlands and Surrey police authorities have invited private security companies to bid for a wide range of services, including criminal investigations, patrolling neighbourhoods and detaining suspects. Greater Manchester chief constable Peter Fahy, Acpo's spokesman on workforce development, said that only \"radical and fundamental\" change would allow forces to cope with the \"enormous challenge of the financial cuts\" and maintain the protection of the public. He said all forces were watching the \u00a31.5bn West Midlands/Surrey tendering process very closely \"to examine where the limits of the involvement of other bodies in policing should lie\". For example, there were elements in a criminal investigation that did not need to be done by a police officer. Fahy said that the office of constable restricted the power of arrest to a warranted officer and was a fundamental safeguard for the public. But that did not mean that others could not help protect the public and bring offenders to justice. The former Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, writing in the Guardian said police forces need to modernise their budgets, \"namely by reducing unit costs\". He says that \"swaths of police tasks'' do not need to be carried out by fully trained officers. These include guarding prisoners, searching woodlands, preparing routine witness statements and providing intelligence analysis to murder inquiries. \"Many forces have employed their own non-police staff to undertake this sort of task but have been unable to do so in sufficient numbers because of the need to employ a fixed and ever increasing number of officers within a fixed budget. \"The tender offered by West Midlands and Surrey police signals a shift which would allow the private sector to provide staff who can carry out routine and repetitive tasks at cheaper rates and, perhaps most intriguingly, to provide temporary access to skilled staff \u2013 such as murder inquiry teams \u2013 which can be hired for incidents that are rare in most forces but for which all forces must permanently retain a group of very expensive staff. This would then allow the chief constable, satisfied that he or she has commissioned these kind of services at a cheaper rate, to spend more of the budget on those parts of the service that require, because of their complexity, their impact on public safety or their centrality to the police mission, to be carried out by fully warranted officers,\" he says. Fahy tried to assuage public fears that outsourcing could lead to private companies carrying out investigations, patrolling or detaining suspects by pointing out that private security staff were already patrolling public spaces and managing major public events, licensed by local authorities: \"Private staff monitor CCTV covering public space, private companies transport prisoners to and from court and store detectives detain shoplifters.\" He said that chief officers needed to ensure that highly trained and professional police officers were spending time on activities which require their skills, expertise and values. \"While there are a number of tasks in a criminal investigation, such as gathering CCTV evidence or checking phone records, which do not necessarily need to be done by a police officer, the investigation itself would be overseen by a police officer in much the same way as a doctor oversees treatment of a patient although other healthcare professionals carry out particular tasks,\" he said. The \u00a31.5bn contract, which could be worth up to \u00a33.5bn if other forces sign up, makes clear that nearly every police service is on the table except for those involving the powers of a warranted officer, including arrest. It will be up to each participating force which services are privatised. A \"bidder's conference\" is due next week. It is expected that the contract would come into force early next year. Bob Jones, chair of the finance committee of the West Midlands police authority and a former chair of the authority and the national organisation of police authorities, said that the trial was \"very much\" driven by central government, particularly Home Office minister Nick Herbert, and Cabinet Office minister and paymaster general Francis Maude. Jones said he was one of five members of the police authority who voted against the trial, because he was unhappy that conditions they had requested were not met, including certainty about the success of other private police trials and more clarity before private companies bid for contracts about what roles they should play. \"I haven't got a problem with the principle, providing it's properly accountable, well managed, it brings benefits and there are protections for staff \u2013 providing it's basically in the interests of the West Midlands,\" said Jones. \"Given the dire financial position, it does need to be explored, but I don't think it's being explored in a proper business-like manner.\" The lack of clarity, and fears of privatisation creep as companies are given increasing powers over time, will be raised by Labour in the Commons at the next home secretary's questions, said Jack Dromey, MP for Birmingham Erdington. \"Government are driving Britain's police service down the path of privatisation with virtually nothing ruled out by ministers at this stage.\" Brian Paddick, the former Scotland Yard deputy assistant commissioner and Lib Dem candidate for London mayor, wrote on the Guardian's Comment is Free website: \"The British tradition of policing by consent, rather than by force and weight of numbers, is being eroded, and plans to use private security firms to carry out core policing tasks, as reported this weekend, will accelerate that process.\" Lynne Owens, the Surrey chief constable ruled out the use of private firms to patrol neighbourhoods: \"Any suggestion that a private sector company will patrol the streets of Surrey is simply nonsense. It would be no more acceptable to the public than it would be to me,\" she said. But although senior officers say that they are only talking about putting back and middle office functions out to contract to support frontline services many critics fear that it involves a radical shift in the dividing line between public and private in policing. The Police Federation warned that it was \"an extremely dangerous road to take\". A Home Office spokesman said: \"We are determined to do anything that will help the police to become more efficient and better able to fight crime. We have been very open in our support for the police in taking these decisions.\"",

      "bodyText": "The human urge to build cities with tall buildings is an ancient one. In the Book of Genesis, the generations who came after the flood were one tribe with one language. They built a great city, Babel, with a tower that reached into the heavens. God felt they were getting above themselves, so he destroyed the tower and confused their language. They scattered as tribes all over the world. It's a narrative that has inspired the latest project from Wildworks, the Cornish theatre company who last year worked with Michael Sheen on the acclaimed The Passion. Babel, a huge participatory outdoor show, will be performed this May, a collaboration between Wildworks and four London theatres. As a warm-up, on a mild Sunday afternoon, a group of 250 people have gathered beneath the clock tower in London's Caledonian Park to sing a traditional English round, Ah Poor Bird; these are just some of the 500-plus people who will take part in the final work, drawn \u2013 like modern-day tribes of Babel \u2013 from the outreach groups of BAC, the Lyric Hammersmith, Young Vic and Theatre Royal Stratford East. The landscape will be used extensively in Babel, which draws on fairytale and myth, the epic of Gilgamesh and the story of Kaspar Hauser, the boy who appeared in the streets of Nuremberg in 1828 claiming to have been raised in isolation; it will also embrace people's memories of London, as well as the history of this recently regenerated park. Why did they pick this park? Wildworks' artistic director Bill Mitchell points to the tower, the vast spaces and copses, and says: \"I don't think we found the park. I like to think it eventually found us.\" Performer Sue Hill invites everyone to mill around and greet strangers with a touch on the nose or a tug of the earlobe. People in nearby flats come out on to balconies to watch, some venturing down to join in. It's a rare sight: a huge group of adults playing unselfconsciously. The crowd have come from all over London; this is the first time some of the young adults from Wandsworth have ever been north of the Thames on their own. Mitchell's aim is to examine the idea of London: \"What are the layers it is made up of? Is it an accumulation of memories? What might it be in the 21st century?\" The irony that a rural theatre company from deepest Cornwall should ask the question is not lost on him. He argues that, with almost a third of the world's population now living in cities, these are questions worth asking. Babel is not a flash-and-dash participatory project, in which a theatre company parachutes in, creates a show with a local community, then makes a quick exit in pursuit of new funding. It has been two years in the making and is the first time four major theatres have worked together in such a way, a recognition of the fact that individual venues can no longer stand alone. Has it been a bumpy ride? \"There are differences in the way we work and, of course, there have been tears,\" admits David Micklem of BAC. \"It's asked us all to do things that we don't normally do, but there is enough good will to make everyone more generous about the way they approach it.\" He quotes an African proverb: \"On my own I can go faster, but together we can go further.\" There is still a way to go. Mitchell's approach is no doubt a little alarming to those used to rehearsing with a script and a clear road map. The beginning and the middle are still undecided, as is the ending \u2013 but if anyone is fazed they are not showing it. \"It can look like chaos,\" says Micklem, \"but there is a tried-and-tested Wildworks' methodology.\" Mitchell trained as a visual artist and creates theatre as if it were a collage. For instance, he gradually builds up layers from a poem unexpectedly proffered at a workshop, or from a memory shared over tea and cake in a community centre (free cake has long been Wildworks' secret weapon). The team are as likely to be found building a bamboo tower with a group of asylum seekers as they are to be spending time at the recently cleared Occupy London camp. \"Many people no longer agree with, or have faith in, the government or the banking system,\" says Mitchell. \"They are looking to other ways of expressing themselves, and that includes last summer's riots and the Occupy movement. The model I'm interested in is neither, but in what happens when you bring together people who feel lost in the city. If the city doesn't fit you, maybe you just have to go out and make your own.\" \u2022 Babel is at Caledonian Park, London N7, 8-20 May. Box office: 0844 412 4314. Website: babellondon.com",

      "bodyText": "When Tom Giles was a teenager he had an unusual encounter with the programme he now edits. His naval architect father starred in a Panorama programme called David and Goliath about his campaign to persuade the Ministry of Defence and British Shipbuilders to order smaller, cheaper ships. Giles the schoolboy watched from behind the sofa. However, his father's non-conformism has had an impact on him, he acknowledges: \"I've been brought up to tilt against established thinking on all sides. I do try and reflect that.\" Panorama, which he joined as deputy editor in 2008, will celebrate 60 years of a somewhat bumpy existence in 2013, and has regained a spring in its step under his stewardship. Last month it won a hat trick of Royal Television Society journalism awards for Undercover Care: The Abuse Exposed, broadcast last May. The Winterbourne View care home was immediately closed, and there were prosecutions and anguished parliamentary debate. Producer Joe Plomin and undercover journalist Joe Casey were also feted for an influential piece of work. The RTS citation said: \"In a year when there has been a question mark over investigative journalism this film is part of TV's answer.\" \"I was very proud of it,\" Giles says. He gave freelance reporter Casey, named RTS young journalist of the year, a contract with the programme. \"What I would say is getting experienced investigative journalists is difficult, but I have not seen any sense that younger people don't want to do it. People want to be part of this.\"Also highly ranked though just missing an RTS award was a second Panorama special, Fifa's Dirty Secrets, broadcast three days before the vote on hosting the 2018 World Cup . The flagship series' claim to a 9pm high-profile slot was also demonstrated when a BBC1 drama was moved to make way for its special on the Stephen Lawrence murder trial verdicts in January. But it has not all been plain sailing for Giles. Days after Undercover Care was broadcast, the BBC Trust ordered Panorama to apologise to Primark for a sequence in a 2008 report on the retailer, showing two small boys in a Bangalore clothing workshop stitching sequins. The trust's finding was that the footage was \"more likely than not \u2026 not authentic\". Although the programme was broadcast before Giles joined, it illustrates the hazards of being the editor of a current affairs strand undertaking investigative journalism. \"For me, the trust finding was about as serious as it gets, it was pretty bad,\" he acknowledges. Giles told his team, many of them angered by the judgment, to \"be grown up about it\" while taking steps to prevent any repetition. Freelancers are now sent on courses, especially if they are going abroad, and instructed on filming undercover and taking contemporaneous notes. In recent months Panorama has faced losing the \u00a3500,000 annual top-up it receives to fund investigative journalism, because of BBC News cuts. But director general Mark Thompson stepped in to save the top-up, Giles says. Its overall annual budget of \u00a36.5m has also been protected from the Delivering Quality First cuts of up to 20%. For that it makes 40 half-hour programmes a year, plus \u2013 as agreed by BBC1 controller Danny Cohen \u2013 seven one-hour specials. \"What makes a special is impact,\" says Giles. \"Undercover Care set the bar high, and it's very hard to be prescriptive.\" The average cost of Panorama is \u00a3225,000 per hour. About 10 programmes are made by independents, 11 come from BBC Northern Ireland, and one from Scotland. \"It is not a great lot [of money], so that investigations money is incredibly important, for every one of those projects like Undercover Care, you have to abandon one, so it's really important we have the room to do that.\" But Panorama is losing several posts. One old hand, Vivian White, the reporter on next Monday's Panorama investigation into tactics used by Rupert Murdoch's TV empire against its competitors, is taking voluntary redundancy. Another veteran journalist, John Ware, since 2007 part of the wider current affairs team, is also going. Jane Corbin is now freelance. The core on-screen reporting team has been whittled down to Paul Kenyon (the reporter on Undercover Care), John Sweeney, Shelley Jofre, Raphael Rowe and Richard Bilton. Under a previous cutback in current affairs the series also loses a producer. Giles took over in 2010 from Sandy Smith, now editor of The One Show, who reduced Panorama from 40 to 29 minutes. His first move was to ditch the introductions by Jeremy Vine that were brought in when Peter Fincham, then controller of BBC1, moved Panorama back from Sunday to Monday in 2007. Vine was dropped partly to save money, says Giles, but \"the real reason is I thought it's better to get on with it. An 8.30pm viewer just wants the story, not someone in White City telling them about it.\" His agenda is to be \"more reactive to big events, reflect the wider economy and people's fears, and free up resources for big 9pm programmes\". Panorama's 9pm specials have also tackled social policy issues, as with Kids in Care: The Truth about Adoption. Giles has ruled out studio discussions, since Question Time and Newsnight fulfil that role. Using celebrity guest presenters is \"unusual\", he says, but Alastair Campbell's recent report on middle class booze addicts showed they can work by winning 4.06 million viewers. \"We didn't have as much negative reaction to him as I had expected,\" Giles notes. \"The extra thing for me was that he was willing to say that maybe the Labour government didn't get it right on 24-hour drinking.\" One of the largest recent audiences was 5 million for The Truth about Supermarket Wars, presented by Sophie Raworth. Panorama's agenda has become more populist at times \u2013 no surprise, as it is up against Coronation Street on Mondays. \"It's partly to do with the 8.30pm slot, it's an incredibly broad BBC1 audience, which tends to be older, more upmarket, but at times it shifts considerably.\" A recent programme on cyber-bullying, featuring Cher Lloyd, an X Factor contestant, attracted younger viewers, as did John Sweeney's forays into scientology and last summer's programme on the riots. \"I am trying to make everything stand out as much as I can,\" Giles says, \"there is nothing off-limits.\" Since Giles became editor, Panorama's average annual ratings have gradually increased, from 2.8 million to 3 million last year. He modestly puts this down to recent audience-grabbing news, but argues another factor is speedy reactions. \"We were like a rabbit caught in the headlights in the old days, we did not move as quickly as we should.\" After university, Giles got his break with a traineeship at the Times. But, in pursuit of his ambition to be a foreign correspondent, he left to join BBC World Service. \"Then television news came for me.\" His wide experience includes being a field producer in hot spots such as Rwanda and working with many of the biggest names in television. The experience of editing Panorama is \"really full-on, absolutely full-on, it suits me,\" he says. It also offers an upwards trajectory \u2013 particularly for those, like him, who also have Newsnight experience \u2013 into the BBC's top management tier. Previous editors include Mark Thompson and Peter Horrocks, now director of the World Service. When this is pointed out, Giles laughs: \"It is a funny old job. It is enormously helpful for people who go up the BBC hierarchy to know what it is like on the job. It suits me.\"",

      "bodyText": "It might be overstretching it to say that Ray Presto, the cult comedian who died last week, saved my marriage. So far, my marriage has not needed saving and if it did I doubt it could ever be put right by a man in his 70s saying things like: \"This morning there was a tap on my window. I'll never use that plumber again.\" But it wouldn't be a lie to say that Presto certainly helped save my groom's speech. Having to give a speech is one of life's more terrifying moments. The key, as most comedians would surely tell you, is to start with something funny. While making a recent best man's speech, I found this harder than it seemed \u2013 I wanted to begin with the funniest story I had, but it involved the groom over-applying genital wart remover and burning layers of skin off his penis during a romantic weekend in Whitby. It wasn't an opening gambit you wanted to bellow in front of the groom's mother through an amplifier. (In the end I went with: \"I don't know why Dave's worried, there's probably not enough time to tell the story of how he burnt the skin of his penis in Whitby\", which struck some sort of balance.) At my own wedding, the groom's speech was filled with thank-yous to bridesmaids and boring stuff like that, but needed something to spark it off. On the numerous occasions I've burned my own penis to shreds during a romantic weekend in Whitby it has been no laughing matter, so that was off the agenda. Minutes before my speech, a friend said: \"Just slip in some Presto, it'll be fine.\" So I did, lifting wholesale from his routines. \"I'm a bit out of sorts,\" I said. \"When I was by the bar earlier, the peanuts started speaking to me. They said I was a very talented and good-looking man. I was really pleased, but then, as I walked past the cigarette machine, it said I was ugly, and a bit of a prat. Luckily the barmaid explained it all. She said the peanuts were complimentary, but the cigarette machine was out of order.\" I relaxed and everything went OK after that. It was a terrible joke, but it somehow worked. This was key to Presto's oeuvre; he seemed to be a throwback to the 1970s, but there was a glint in his eye so you spent the act confused as to whether he was sending that era up. To judge by an obituary on comedy site Chortle, Presto \u2013 real name David Shaw \u2013 had an interesting life. He was a committed hedonist, penning the 1972 book Choose Your Pleasure before writing columns for Penthouse. Yet the obituary was also sad: his real desire was to be taken seriously as a writer (his latest project was apparently a commentary on the phone hacking scandal) and he never realised his dream. It's strange to think that someone with such thwarted ambitions can still have a big impact on other people's lives, yet never know this. I caught Presto by chance at one of his open mic performances and spent the following months retelling his jokes, watching his MySpace clips and wondering what he did when not on stage. But he wouldn't know this, let alone that he helped put my wedding day speech on track. Hearing of Presto's death made me think about the other bit-part players in my life \u2013 the people I'd ascribed important roles to, as if directing my life like Philip Seymour Hoffman in Synecdoche, New York. People such as Rave Grandad, the long-bearded pensioner who would show up at techno nights in Leeds around the turn of the millennium, silently dancing to terrible psychedelic trance tracks as if holding a free bus pass was no barrier to putting in a 10-hour shift under the strobes. These are the real cult heroes in life. They're your personal treasured characters who have come on for a cameo and stolen the show. In the screenplay of your existence, they're Steve Buscemi \u2013 brief, charismatic and usually with a funny face. Another such character was a friend of a friend called John Iacovelli, who I was told wrote incredible songs (as a music journalist, I've heard this a lot \u2013 you take it with a pinch of salt). Iacovelli was odder and funnier than almost all the pop stars I've met. He once told his friends he was having a week's holiday in Cardiff. They didn't believe him and, sure enough, when they went to his house he was in his living room, drinking fortified wine and listening to Noel Coward. He just wanted a week's peace and quiet. Amazingly, his music was even better than I'd been told. One track, Crumbs, is to my mind one of the most beautiful love songs ever composed. It concerns a guy who can't get over his ex, however terribly she treated him (hence the title \u2013 \"All she ever fed me was crumbs\"). The opening line is heartbreaking: \"Although we no longer dance, I've got evidence \u2026 because I kept the ticket stubs.\" He was also funny with his despair: \"I let the garden grow, on the bit you used to mow. I blubbed when the bath got scrubbed.\" It could have appeared on the Magnetic Fields' landmark album 69 Love Songs. Instead, I doubt 69 people have heard it. Unless they're close friends, or attended one of about a dozen open mic nights he played in Leeds around 2008, before deciding he didn't have the motivation to pursue things further. How many other genius songwriters, authors, painters, writers, comics and characters are out there, whose gifts will barely be recognised but will stay with a select few for ever? Harry Deansway, who frequently booked Presto, asked him shortly before his death what he used to do before he retired. Presto said: \"I was unemployed.\" His joke reveals a deeper truth \u2013 in a way these personal cult stars are permanently unemployed, their talents unrewarded with money. Yet by touching people so greatly they provide untold riches, even if it's not they who reap the rewards.",

      "body": "<p>It might be overstretching it to say that Ray Presto, the cult comedian who died last week, saved my marriage. So far, my marriage has not needed saving and if it did I doubt it could ever be put right by a man in his 70s saying things like: \"This morning there was a tap on my window. I'll never use that plumber again.\" But it wouldn't be a lie to say that Presto certainly helped save my groom's speech.</p> <p>Having to give a speech is one of life's more terrifying moments. The key, as most comedians would surely tell you, is to start with something funny. While making a recent best man's speech, I&#xa0;found this harder than it seemed \u2013 I wanted to begin with the funniest story I had, but it involved the groom over-applying genital wart remover and burning layers of skin off his penis during a romantic weekend in Whitby. It wasn't an opening gambit you wanted to bellow in front of the groom's mother through an amplifier. (In the end I went with: \"I don't know why Dave's worried, there's probably not enough time to tell the story of how he burnt the skin of his penis in Whitby\", which struck some sort of balance.)</p> <p>At my own wedding, the groom's speech was filled with thank-yous to bridesmaids and boring stuff like that, but needed something to spark it off. On the numerous occasions I've burned my own penis to shreds during a romantic weekend in Whitby it has been no laughing matter, so that was off the agenda. Minutes before my speech, a friend said: \"Just slip in some Presto, it'll be fine.\"</p> <p>So I did, lifting wholesale from his routines. \"I'm a bit out of sorts,\" I said. \"When I was by the bar earlier, the peanuts started speaking to me. They said I was a very talented and good-looking man. I was really pleased, but then, as I walked past the cigarette machine, it said I was ugly, and a bit of a prat.

It was \"ground zero\" in the explosion of HIV. Timberg and Halperin write: \"To fulfill its grim destiny, HIV needed a kind of place never before seen in central Africa but one that now was rising in the heart of the region: a big, thriving, hectic place jammed with people and energy, where old rules were cast aside amid the tumult of new commerce. \"It needed Kinshasa.

      "bodyText": "When the three current party leaders come to write their memoirs, it's hard to imagine how they're going to bring the pages alive with stories of their pre-parliamentary life, when they barely even had one. This wasn't a problem for Peter Hain. The first third of his autobiography reads more like a political thriller than a memoir, and leaves the vanilla back-stories of today's former special advisers looking almost comically bland. Outside In recalls a dramatic childhood in South Africa, as the son of anti-apartheid activists who were spied on by the country's Special Branch, harassed and imprisoned, until the family was forced into exile in London in 1966. Only 16, Hain was already something of a veteran; a year earlier he'd had to deliver the funeral address of a family friend and fellow activist who had been hanged in a Pretoria prison. As a student in London, Hain began organising pitch invasions of sports matches against visiting South African teams, and the success of his campaign to halt the 1970 South African cricket tour drove the British establishment to distraction, securing Hain's notoriety. \"It would be a mercy,\" the columnist Sir John Junor famously wrote, \"if this unpleasant little creep were to be dropped into a sewerage tank. Up to his ankles. Head first.\" Hain was followed and bugged by MI5, was sent a letter bomb in the mail, and was then framed in a London bank robbery by the South African security services. He sensationally and successfully defended himself at the Old Bailey. In the febrile politics of the 70s, Hain was becoming a folk hero. Defecting from the Young Liberals to Labour in 1977, he began working for a trade union and helped found the Anti Nazi League, standing twice for parliament during the 1980s. With a peculiar symmetry of timing, a year after Nelson Mandela finally walked free in South Africa Hain arrived at last in Westminster, elected in 1991 to represent Neath. At 41 he'd already lived a more thrilling political life than most senior ministers \u2013 and it's impossible to read his book without reflecting that the contrast has only sharpened ever since. But it's also impossible not to notice Hain's concern, throughout the book, to rebut the charge of \"ambitious\", which has attached itself to him throughout his Westminster career. He suspects these two themes \u2013 his extra-parliamentary fame, and the suspicion of personal ambition \u2013 are not unconnected. \"I think I got the label because, certainly among people today aged over 50 or 60, they would probably know of me more than a lot of other people in politics, because of the anti-apartheid sports campaigns,\" he reflects. \"My profile was one of the highest in government \u2013 even though I didn't necessarily hold the highest jobs.\" Although he doesn't explicitly accuse anyone of jealousy, that seems to be what he is saying. \"But I never even thought I'd be an MP. I was always ambitious to make a difference \u2013 but I honestly wasn't that bothered about the position \u2013 and I'm still not, I'm not. So ambitious for change, yes I'll happily accept that for a label. Ambitious in career terms? No I don't think so.\" Either way, he did achieve high office, serving in cabinet for six years of the Labour government under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown \u2013 and also achieved significant change. As Northern Ireland secretary, he brokered the historic 2007 deal which saw the IRA lay down its arms for good. He was also a popular and effective secretary of state for Wales. Now back in opposition, he retains the Welsh brief and is a high-profile member of the shadow-bench team; Outside In certainly doesn't read like the memoir of a man who feels that his opportunities to effect change are behind him. If anything, I get the impression from the book that he has a sneaking sense of underachievement. He is forever quoting colleagues, civil servants, officials and the like telling him how brilliant he is, so I ask if he feels he's never yet been as successful as he ought rightfully to have been. \"No, I put the quotes in because I was trying to give an honest representation of what they said.\" I can't recall any instances of him quoting anyone telling him he was rubbish though. \"Maybe because it didn't happen,\" he laughs. There's no admission, either, of any mistakes on his part \u2013 apart from one. \"The deputy leader campaign. I do wish I hadn't stood for the deputy leadership.\" In 2007 he finished an ignominious fifth out of six in the race to replace John Prescott. But the real disaster struck a year later, when it emerged that he'd failed to declare a number of campaign donations, sparking a police investigation and forcing him to resign from government. He always insisted it was an innocent oversight, and no charges were brought, but the gist of his defence in his memoir seems to be that loads of other politicians forgot to declare big donations, so it was unfair to single him out. He wouldn't buy the \"everyone else does it\" defence of, say, smoking cannabis, he agrees at once \u2013 \"No, of course.\" So why does it apply in his case? \"Well in the end what was this about?\" he counters, and I realise the subject is still terribly raw. \"It was about an honest mistake and a disorganised end to the campaign and when I found out about it I told everyone. It's quite possible that nobody would ever have found out if I hadn't done that. And a lot of thanks I got for it.\" The indignation is understandable, but I notice that while his book lists the precise and substantial sums others forgot to declare, it fails to mention that his own exceeded \u00a3100,000. \"Oh,\" he says. \"Well it wasn't a conscious strategy on my part.\" Why does he think the Electoral Commission came down so hard on him? \"Well they wanted to make an example of me, and I came along at the right time.\" The title, Outside In, hints at an enduring sense of otherness within the British political establishment, and when I ask if he still feels like an outsider he concedes: \"A bit. But it wasn't something that worried me or made me feel insecure. On the contrary, I think it gave me a strength. Everybody born and brought up in Britain is a product of the British class system, which is corrosive, and I'm not encumbered by that.\" Even so, he must have been surprised not to be elected to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. \"Er, yes. But I think a lot of people thought I would be elected anyway so they didn't have to vote for me, so, er, there we are. It was a rather surprising outcome from my point of view, but I think that was probably the reason actually.\" Hain was one of Miliband's most vocal champions during the Labour leadership election, so I ask if he's disappointed by his leader's poll ratings. \"Well of course I'd like him to do better,\" he agrees frankly. So why isn't he? \"Well you've got to start off with the electoral reality that coming back from 29%, for any opposition leader \u2013 including Ed's brother \u2013 to bounce back into a kind of mega league just defies political reality, it doesn't happen like that.\" It sounds as if he's suggesting Labour can't win the next election. \"No, what I'm saying is that people continually place the bar too high for Ed. For over a year we've been [polling] round about the late 30s to 40% \u2013 a 10% recovery \u2013 that's a big achievement. The Tories didn't win a by election for about 10 years after they lost in 97. We've held every one, with swings to us. The May elections in Wales, we got our best ever result.\" But in all of those elections, voters could tick Labour without any risk of delivering Miliband to No 10. Most people seem to have difficulty regarding him as a credible prime minister, I suggest. Hain doesn't contradict me, offering instead: \"Well I don't think most people know Ed yet. And if you look at Cameron's first period in charge, his ratings were in fact slightly worse than Ed's.\" Does Hain feel that things are actually going well then? \"Look, the last person who is complacent about this is Ed. I think he has strengthened his leadership and grip on the party and shadow cabinet. He has been proved right on a lot of things, from Murdoch to bankers' bonuses to the destruction of the NHS. Now would I like to be higher in the polls? Of course I would \u2013 and so would Ed. Do we have a long way to go? Yeah, of course we do.\" Hain launches into an attack on Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems, blaming them for the loss of the AV referendum \u2013 \"I always said that bracketing it with the local elections would be catastrophic. I'm a lifelong AV supporter. Clegg threw away a once-in-a-political-lifetime opportunity to change the voting system,\" \u2013 and accuses him of \"betraying the Liberal tradition\". But Labour can't win next time by merely mopping up disillusioned Lib Dem voters. \"No,\" he agrees quietly, \"and I think we know that. We have to win sufficient Tory-switcher supporters in marginal seats in the south of England.\" There isn't much evidence of them coming over yet, is there? \"No.\" Then, after a pause, he volunteers something quite surprising for an opposition front bencher. He may not be saying Labour can't win the next election \u2013 but he doesn't appear to think they will. \"I think actually that it's going to be very hard for any party to win an outright majority at the next election. Very hard. But I think we can be the biggest party.\" And form a government with the Lib Dems? \"Not with Clegg and co. They stand for just about the opposite of everything we stand for. But I think the Lib Dems are probably going to split. Immediately after the next election. I choose my words carefully, but some very senior people within the Liberal party are extremely unhappy.\" So just to clarify, he predicts a hung parliament in 2015, a split in the Lib Dem party, and a government formed by Labour and half of Clegg's old party? \"That's what I think we're fighting for. Yeah. And I think that's a very realistic prospect.\" For those on the left Hain was a reassuring presence in the Labour government \u2013 principled, genial, and unaligned to either the Blair or Brown faction. But his willingness to support the line on Iraq and civil liberties left some feeling betrayed \u2013 and there are moments in the book when it sounds as if he almost went native, describing the job of authorising intercept warrants as \"a fascinating task which I undertook with diligent enthusiasm\". Given his own experience at the hands of the security services, why didn't he take a stronger stand on civil liberties? \"I didn't just blindly swallow it all,\" he objects. \"ID cards I never saw as a big number; most democratic countries have them, and I never saw it as a big issue. I was always worried about the issues of detention, partly because of my South African experience. We had an attitude in New Labour where you'd go for the maximum, have a big row and end up with somewhere more minimal. My argument in government was that this may be a view of political tactics, but there was a very high attrition rate along the way. I always felt you could be tough on crime and security without being seen to be so gratuitous about individual liberty. And I argued that.\" But it was his loyalty to the government over Iraq that surprised most of his supporters \u2013 including his parents, wife and two sons, which he admits he found \"chastening\". Had he known there were no WMDs, he would have voted against it. \"Yes, of course.\" But he refuses, even now, to say he was wrong. \"People who, for example, during the [2007] deputy leader campaign said: 'Actually we were totally wrong and I was wrong' \u2013 I just think that's a bit of a cop-out. You can't have it both ways. \"Do I think the world is a better place without him? Yeah, I do think it is. Are the Iraqi people better off without Saddam Hussein as their ruler? Yes I think they are. So it's always been a difficult judgment for me. I'm just judging where we are now, and I think it's too early to say whether the fact that Saddam Hussein was toppled has been a good thing or a bad thing.\" Critics would say it's Hain who's still trying to have it both ways. He smiles: \"Well the left has always been quick to perceive betrayal in their own\" \u2013 and that's certainly true. Hain sees himself instead as a pragmatist \u2013 \"not an all- or-nothing politician, but an all or something politician\". Having been a fervent supporter of the euro, he's now glad we didn't join \u2013 \"Who isn't?\" he laughs \u2013 but in 2002, at Blair's request, he even set up a secret group behind Brown's back to push for a referendum on joining the single currency. \"Being pro euro wasn't an article of faith for me,\" he says now, \"but an economic mechanism. It either works or it doesn't; it's not a principle.\" He believes the euro will almost certainly survive. \"But for as long as they pursue a rightwing austerity programme, instead of a jobs and growth programme, to deal with the deficit, I'm pretty pessimistic about the future of Europe. I've very worried because lots of the countries most in trouble had fascist governments not so long ago. I think the rise of the right is a great danger, and we've got to be very careful not to repeat the mistakes of the 30s. People don't realise how dangerous this is. And the problem with depression and recession today is that people's expectations are so much higher. In the 30s you still had a deferential society. There was tremendous poverty and strife and riot \u2013 but nothing on the scale that I think you could see if this continues for much longer.\" When I point out that large numbers of voters blame Labour's profligacy for our economic problems, he is surprisingly \u2013 if gloomily \u2013 candid. \"Yeah. And that's where the Tories have been effective. With what I call the big deceit in British politics.\" The argument Labour has to win is simple: \"If we had been spending too much, why did the Tories and Lib Dems sign up to our spending programme for the next three years? They can't have it both ways. Spending was not too high, borrowing was not too high, debt had come down from what we inherited from the Tories. But the banking crisis blew the economy out of the water, and that's why I think we're victims of the big deceit in British politics. \"This will decide whether we win or lose the next election. Whether we win this argument. Or can at least get a score draw on it.\"",

      "body": "<p>When the three current party leaders come to write their memoirs, it's hard to imagine how they're going to bring the pages alive with stories of their pre-parliamentary life, when they barely even had one. This wasn't a problem for Peter Hain. The first third of his autobiography reads more like a political thriller than a memoir, and leaves the vanilla back-stories of today's former special advisers looking almost comically bland.</p> <p>Outside In recalls a dramatic childhood in South Africa, as the son of anti-apartheid activists who were spied on by the country's Special Branch, harassed and imprisoned, until the family was forced into exile in London in 1966. Only 16, Hain was already something of a veteran; a year earlier he'd had to deliver the funeral address of a family friend and fellow activist who had been hanged in a Pretoria prison.</p> <p>As a student in London, Hain began organising pitch invasions of sports matches against visiting South African teams, and the success of his campaign to halt the 1970 South African cricket tour drove the British establishment to distraction, securing Hain's notoriety. \"It would be a mercy,\" the columnist Sir John Junor famously wrote, \"if this unpleasant little creep were to be dropped into a sewerage tank. Up to his ankles. Head first.\" Hain was followed and bugged by MI5, was sent a letter bomb in the mail, and was then framed in a London bank robbery by the South African security services. He sensationally and successfully defended himself at the Old Bailey. In the febrile politics of the 70s, Hain was becoming a folk hero.</p> <p>Defecting from the Young Liberals to Labour in 1977, he began working for a trade union and helped found the Anti Nazi League, standing twice for parliament during the 1980s. With a peculiar symmetry of timing, a year after Nelson Mandela finally walked free in South Africa Hain arrived at last in Westminster, elected in 1991 to represent Neath.</p> <p>At 41 he'd already lived a more thrilling political life than most senior ministers \u2013 and it's impossible to read his book without reflecting that the contrast has only sharpened ever since. But it's also impossible not to notice Hain's concern, throughout the book, to rebut the charge of \"ambitious\", which has attached itself to him throughout his Westminster career. He suspects these two themes \u2013 his extra-parliamentary fame, and the suspicion of personal ambition \u2013 are not unconnected.</p> <p>\"I think I got the label because, certainly among people today aged over 50 or 60, they would probably know of me more than a lot of other people in politics, because of the anti-apartheid sports campaigns,\" he reflects. \"My profile was one of the highest in government \u2013 even though I didn't necessarily hold the highest jobs.\" Although he doesn't explicitly accuse anyone of jealousy, that seems to be what he is saying.</p> <p>\"But I never even thought I'd be an MP. I was always ambitious to make a difference \u2013 but I honestly wasn't that bothered about the position \u2013 and I'm still not, I'm not. So ambitious for change, yes I'll happily accept that for a label. Ambitious in career terms? No I don't think so.\"</p> <p>Either way, he did achieve high office, serving in cabinet for six years of the Labour government under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown \u2013 and also achieved significant change. As Northern Ireland secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/11/comment.northernireland?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">he brokered the historic 2007 deal which saw the IRA lay down its arms for good</a>. He was also a popular and effective secretary of state for Wales.</p> <p>Now back in opposition, he retains the Welsh brief and is a high-profile member of the shadow-bench team; Outside In certainly doesn't read like the memoir of a man who feels that his opportunities to effect change are behind him. If anything, I get the impression from the book that he has a sneaking sense of underachievement. He is forever quoting colleagues, civil servants, officials and the like telling him how brilliant he is, so I ask if he feels he's never yet been as successful as he ought rightfully to have been.</p> <p>\"No, I put the quotes in because I was trying to give an honest representation of what they said.\" I can't recall any instances of him quoting anyone telling him he was rubbish though. \"Maybe because it didn't happen,\" he laughs. There's no admission, either, of any mistakes on his part \u2013 apart from one. \"The deputy leader campaign. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/21/labourdeputy.labour\" title=\"\">I do wish I hadn't stood for the deputy leadership</a>.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/24/labourdeputy.labour2\" title=\"\">In 2007 he finished an ignominious fifth out of six in the race to replace John Prescott</a>. But the real disaster struck a year later, when it emerged that he'd failed to declare a number of campaign donations, sparking a police investigation and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jan/24/partyfunding.uk\" title=\"\">forcing him to resign from government</a>. He always insisted it was an innocent oversight, <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/dec/05/peter-hain-party-funding\" title=\"\">and no charges were brought</a>, but the gist of his defence in his memoir seems to be that loads of other politicians forgot to declare big donations, so it was unfair to single him out. He wouldn't buy the \"everyone else does it\" defence of, say, smoking cannabis, he agrees at once \u2013 \"No, of course.\" So why does it apply in his case?</p> <p>\"Well in the end what was this about?\" he counters, and I realise the subject is still terribly raw. \"It was about an honest mistake and a disorganised end to the campaign and when I found out about it I told everyone. It's quite possible that nobody would ever have found out if I hadn't done that. And a lot of thanks I got for it.\"</p> <p>The indignation is understandable, but I notice that while his book lists the precise and substantial sums others forgot to declare, it fails to mention that his own exceeded \u00a3100,000. \"Oh,\" he says. \"Well it wasn't a conscious strategy on my part.\" Why does he think the Electoral Commission came down so hard on him? \"Well they wanted to make an example of me, and I came along at the right time.\"</p> <p>The title, Outside In, hints at an enduring sense of otherness within the British political establishment, and when I ask if he still feels like an outsider he concedes: \"A bit. But it wasn't something that worried me or made me feel insecure. On the contrary, I think it gave me a strength. Everybody born and brought up in Britain is a product of the British class system, which is corrosive, and I'm not encumbered by that.\" Even so, he must have been surprised not to be elected to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. \"Er, yes. But I think a lot of people thought I would be elected anyway so they didn't have to vote for me, so, er, there we are. It was a rather surprising outcome from my point of view, but I think that was probably the reason actually.\"</p> <p>Hain was one of Miliband's most vocal champions during the Labour leadership election, so I ask if he's disappointed by his leader's poll ratings. \"Well of course I'd like him to do better,\" he agrees frankly. So why isn't he? \"Well you've got to start off with the electoral reality that coming back from 29%, for any opposition leader \u2013 including Ed's brother \u2013 to bounce back into a kind of mega league just defies political reality, it doesn't happen like that.\"</p> <p>It sounds as if he's suggesting Labour can't win the next election. \"No, what I'm saying is that people continually place the bar too high for Ed. For over a year we've been [polling] round about the late 30s to 40% \u2013 a 10% recovery \u2013 that's a big achievement. The Tories didn't win a by election for about 10 years after they lost in 97. We've held every one, with swings to us. The May elections in Wales, we got our best ever result.\"</p> <p>But in all of those elections, voters could tick Labour without any risk of delivering Miliband to No 10. Most people seem to have difficulty regarding him as a credible prime minister, I suggest. Hain doesn't contradict me, offering instead: \"Well I don't think most people know Ed yet. And if you look at Cameron's first period in charge, his ratings were in fact slightly worse than Ed's.\" Does Hain feel that things are actually going well then?</p> <p>\"Look, the last person who is complacent about this is Ed. I think he has strengthened his leadership and grip on the party and shadow cabinet. He has been proved right on a lot of things, from Murdoch to bankers' bonuses to the destruction of the NHS. Now would I like to be higher in the polls? Of course I would \u2013 and so would Ed. Do we have a long way to go? Yeah, of course we do.\"</p> <p>Hain launches into an attack on Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems, blaming them for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/06/av-referendum-results-map?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">loss of the AV referendum</a> \u2013 \"I always said that bracketing it with the local elections would be catastrophic. I'm a lifelong AV supporter. Clegg threw away a once-in-a-political-lifetime opportunity to change the voting system,\" \u2013 and accuses him of \"betraying the Liberal tradition\". But Labour can't win next time by merely mopping up disillusioned Lib Dem voters. \"No,\" he agrees quietly, \"and I think we know that. We have to win sufficient Tory-switcher supporters in marginal seats in the south of England.\"</p> <p>There isn't much evidence of them coming over yet, is there? \"No.\" Then, after a pause, he volunteers something quite surprising for an opposition front bencher. He may not be saying Labour can't win the next election \u2013 but he doesn't appear to think they will.</p> <p>\"I think actually that it's going to be very hard for any party to win an outright majority at the next election. Very hard. But I think we can be the biggest party.\" And form a government with the Lib Dems? \"Not with Clegg and co. They stand for just about the opposite of everything we stand for. But I think the Lib Dems are probably going to split. Immediately after the next election. I choose my words carefully, but some very senior people within the Liberal party are extremely unhappy.\"</p> <p>So just to clarify, he predicts a hung parliament in 2015, a split in the Lib Dem party, and a government formed by Labour and half of Clegg's old party?</p> <p>\"That's what I think we're fighting for. Yeah. And I think that's a very realistic prospect.\"</p> <p>For those on the left Hain was a reassuring presence in the Labour government \u2013 principled, genial, and unaligned to either the Blair or Brown faction. But his willingness to support the line on Iraq and civil liberties left some feeling betrayed \u2013 and there are moments in the book when it sounds as if he almost went native, describing the job of authorising intercept warrants as \"a fascinating task which I undertook with diligent enthusiasm\". Given his own experience at the hands of the security services, why didn't he take a stronger stand on civil liberties?</p> <p>\"I didn't just blindly swallow it all,\" he objects. \"ID cards I never saw as a big number; most democratic countries have them, and I never saw it as a big issue. I was always worried about the issues of detention, partly because of my South African experience. We had an attitude in New Labour where you'd go for the maximum, have a big row and end up with somewhere more minimal. My argument in government was that this may be a view of political tactics, but there was a very high attrition rate along the way. I always felt you could be tough on crime and security without being seen to be so gratuitous about individual liberty. And I argued that.\"</p> <p>But it was his loyalty to the government over Iraq that surprised most of his supporters \u2013 including his parents, wife and two sons, which he admits he found \"chastening\". Had he known there were no WMDs, he would have voted against it. \"Yes, of course.\" But he refuses, even now, to say he was wrong. \"People who, for example, during the [2007] deputy leader campaign said: 'Actually we were totally wrong and I was wrong' \u2013 I just think that's a bit of a cop-out.

      "bodyText": "Top bankers at Barclays are expected to have millions of pounds of bonuses handed out in the coming days in a move that could trigger fresh controversy about City pay. Just a week after the bank was forced to admit that HM Revenue &amp; Customs had shut down two of its schemes designed to avoid \u00a3500m in tax, Barclays is thought to be preparing to release millions of pounds of shares to its highest-ranking staff under performance-related pay deals handed out in the past. Among those in line for the rewards are Rich Ricci and Jerry del Missier, who run the Barclays Capital investment bank, Tom Kalaris, head of wealth management, Antony Jenkins, head of the retail bank, and Robert Le Blanc, who is head of risk. Disclosures made to the stock exchange appear to suggest they stand to receive up to \u00a37.5m from pay deals they were agreed in 2010, although the bank will also have to disclose other elements of their complex pay deals which will push their total packages higher. Last year, the five shared in \u00a3110m when deals from previous years paid out, making them the five highest paid Barclays executives. The disclosures emerged under the Project Merlin deal agreed with the government to highlight pay deals outside the boardroom. HSBC last week became the first to comply with Treasury requirements to publish the top eight highest paid executives, rather than the top five, who shared \u00a330m between them. The Barclays finance director Chris Lucas could get 1.6m shares, worth \u00a34m at current prices, from a three-year long-term incentive plan that is due to vest in March 2012. It is subject to performance criteria which means it is unlikely that he will receive the full amount, the 2010 annual report shows. Lucas would have been closely involved in the two \"highly abusive\" share deals that the Treasury shut down a week ago on the advice of HMRC, even taking the unusual step of retrospective changes to the law which left Barclays with a \u00a3300m tax bill for gains it had made on buying back its own debt on the market. The publicity surrounding the closure of the tax avoidance scheme came just a fortnight after Bob Diamond had been heralding the bank's approach to \"citizenship\". His pay for his first full year as chief executive \u2013 after more than decade running Barclays Capital \u2013 will also be disclosed when the bank's remuneration report is published within the next fortnight. He has admitted that the bank's return on equity \u2013 a key measure scrutinised by shareholders \u2013 has fallen well short of the 13% target he had set for 2013. The Barclays payouts come as Stephen Hester, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, is on course to be handed \u00a3600,000 related to his work for 2010. The \u00a3600,000 is based on an award of 4.5m shares he received last March, half of which are due to be handed to him on 7 March, although he has agreed not to sell them for 12 months. Eight of his senior management team are also scheduled to receive their share awards from 2010, worth about \u00a31.2m, which they cannot cash in for six months. Hester is also among top RBS bankers poised to get a combined \u00a311m when bonuses awarded three years ago pay up.",

      "bodyText": "A Catholic clergyman who described gay marriage as \"madness\" faced criticism on Sunday when he was accused of scaremongering and Downing Street reiterated the prime minister's personal support on the issue. In an article for a Sunday newspaper, Cardinal Keith O'Brien accused the coalition of trying to \"redefine reality\" with its proposal for legalising gay marriage, which is due to go out for consultation later this month. The letter reignited a sometimes passionate debate over the issue, which David Cameron made a personal crusade when he used his party speech two years ago to support gay marriage \"because I am a Conservative\". A Downing St spokesman said there was no change in the government's pledge to legalise gay marriage, though he said Cameron was \"relaxed\" about church criticisms, which have also been voiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury. \"There inevitably will be some people in the church who disagree with us, but it's important for equality,\" he said. Margot James, the first openly lesbian Conservative MP, criticised the \"apocalyptic language\" used by the cardinal and accused him of \"scaremongering\". She told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show: \"I think it is a completely unacceptable way for a prelate to talk. I think the government is not trying to force Catholic churches to perform gay marriages at all. It is a purely civil matter.\" She added: \"I think this sort of scaremongering is what it is, it is just scaremongering.\" Cardinal O'Brien wrote in the Sunday Telegraph: \"Since all the legal rights of marriage are already available to homosexual couples, it is clear that this proposal is not about rights, but rather is an attempt to redefine marriage for the whole of society at the behest of a small minority of activists. \"Same-sex marriage would eliminate entirely in law the basic idea of a mother and a father for every child. It would create a society which deliberately chooses to deprive a child of either a mother or a father. \"Other dangers exist. If marriage can be redefined so that it no longer means a man and a woman but two men or two women, why stop there? Why not allow three men or a woman and two men to constitute a marriage, if they pledge their fidelity to one another?\" Earlier this week the Home Office defended the plans after Tory MP Peter Bone called them \"completely nuts\". A Home Office spokeswoman said the government believed that \"if a couple love each other\" and want to commit to a life together they should \"have the option of a civil marriage irrespective of their sexual orientation\". Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone is due to launch a consultation on the plans later this month. Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said she hoped the comments would not end up \"fuelling or legitimising prejudice.\" She told the Andrew Marr Show: \"We have had prejudice, discrimination and homophobia for hundreds of years, that doesn't make it right. \"I don't want anybody to feel that this is a licence for whipping up prejudice.\"",

      "bodyText": "The disclosure of a police or MI5 link to a blacklist of construction workers known for political and trades union activity, revealed by the Observer, comes as no surprise. Industrial blacklists of workers with either leftwing connections, or simply a record of health and safety activity, have existed for decades. The inclusion of a victim's name can have a devastating and lifelong effect. As a young man my paternal grandfather returned from the trenches at the end of the first world war. He became a skilled engineer working in Leeds, and was a union steward. In a strike in the 1920s he pushed a scab (strikebreaker) from his bicycle. He was blacklisted and was never able to work in engineering again. He got a job as a tram and bus conductor and driver, which he held for the rest of his working life. Following the Russian revolution and the spread of communist ideology, the 1900s saw blacklisting reach new levels in Britain, with the foundation of the Economic League in 1919, funded by large companies wishing to vet potential employees before taking them on. As industrial reporter on the Leeds-based Yorkshire Evening Post in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, I received booklets from the Economic League detailing every left political party and organisation in Britain, with analyses of their backgrounds, motives and operational methods. The League's activities embraced more than political party members and trades union activists. Any organisation deemed to pose a threat to the activities and profits of big business \u2013 including \"green\" groups set up in the 1980s as awareness of environmental issues mushroomed \u2013 were investigated by the League, and their activists listed. The redoubtable investigative journalist Paul Foot, himself a member of the Socialist Workers' party and employed by the Daily Mirror at the time, managed to obtain a copy of the blacklist. He offered to inform individual activists of their inclusion or otherwise on the League's list of alleged agitators and troublemakers. The League went out of existence in 1994 following exposure of its activities by the Guardian, but the work of blacklisting continued. The League's successor, which involved former directors of the League, was known as \"Caprim\". Then came the Consulting Association, subject of this weekend's revelations. The involvement of state security forces in supplying information first to the Economic League, then to its successors, has been suspected, even assumed, by union and other activists for decades. The weekend's revelations confirm those suspicions. The question now is: what action is to be taken against those responsible? \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

Industrial blacklists of workers with either leftwing connections, or simply a record of health and safety activity, have existed for decades.</p> <p>The inclusion of a victim's name can have a devastating and lifelong effect. As a young man my paternal grandfather returned from the trenches at the end of the first world war. He became a skilled engineer working in Leeds, and was a union steward. In a strike in the 1920s he pushed a scab (strikebreaker) from his bicycle. He was blacklisted and was never able to work in engineering again. He got a job as a tram and bus conductor and driver, which he held for the rest of his working life.</p> <p>Following the Russian revolution and the spread of communist ideology, the 1900s saw blacklisting reach new levels in Britain, with the foundation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_League_%28United_Kingdom%29\" title=\"\">Economic League</a> in 1919, funded by large companies wishing to vet potential employees before taking them on.</p> <p>As industrial reporter on the Leeds-based Yorkshire Evening Post in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, I received booklets from the Economic League detailing every left political party and organisation in Britain, with analyses of their backgrounds, motives and operational methods.</p> <p>The League's activities embraced more than political party members and trades union activists. Any organisation deemed to pose a threat to the activities and profits of big business \u2013 including \"green\" groups set up in the 1980s as awareness of environmental issues mushroomed \u2013 were investigated by the League, and their activists listed.</p> <p>The redoubtable investigative journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jul/20/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Paul Foot</a>, himself a member of the Socialist Workers' party and employed by the Daily Mirror at the time, managed to obtain a copy of the blacklist. He offered to inform individual activists of their inclusion or otherwise on the League's list of alleged agitators and troublemakers.</p> <p>The League went out of existence in 1994 following exposure of its activities by the Guardian, but the work of blacklisting continued. The League's successor, which involved former directors of the League, was known as \"Caprim\". Then came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/03/blacklisted-building-workers-court-hopes\" title=\"\">the Consulting Association</a>, subject of this weekend's revelations. The involvement of state security forces in supplying information first to the Economic League, then to its successors, has been suspected, even assumed, by union and other activists for decades. The weekend's revelations confirm those suspicions.</p> <p>The question now is: what action is to be taken against those responsible?</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/uk-edition\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>",

The \"devil is in the detail\" admitted Rupert Bondy, BP's group general counsel, in a briefing call with City analysts after the outline deal signed before the weekend. Bondy remained hopeful that both sides would be able to complete a process that he believed represented a \"significant step\" towards removing uncertainty over the future of Britain's biggest oil group. The two sides now have 45 days in which to tie up a final accord and the BP share price \u2013 dogged by the legal case \u2013 could be boosted on Monday by the legal agreement. Later this week, the company could be in for less flattering news when the 2011 annual report is expected to be published and show chief executive Bob Dudley was paid a financial bonus during what has remained a difficult year. In February it was revealed he \u2013 and two other directors \u2013 had received performance-related share payouts. BP said the $7.8bn figure for the settlement was \"neither a floor nor a ceiling\" but it reinforced previous estimates that the total cost of all liabilities should be no more than $37.2bn. The deal covering 110,000 private claims, including those of fishermen who lost their livelihoods because of the spill, has postponed the start of a trial that was due to begin in New Orleans on Monday. The court case had already been delayed by a week. The company still faces claims from various states and most significantly action by the Department of Justice, which said at the weekend the private settlement did not compensate for significant damages or BP's \"violation of the law\". The department added: \"While we are pleased that BP may be stepping up to address harms to individual plaintiffs, this by no means fully addresses its responsibility for the harms it has caused.\" The US state is bringing a negligence case against BP for the explosion on April 2010, which caused millions of barrels of oil to be leaked from the Deepwater Horizon rig, killed 11 workers and polluted beaches in Louisiana. If BP is found \"grossly negligent\" it could be fined as much as $18bn under the Clean Water Act alone but the company said on Sunday \u2013 as it had argued all along \u2013 that this would not be the case.",

The kind that, at Chelsea, tends to precede an unscheduled visit to the training ground from the owner, a monotone confirmation of the worst and a promise of a considerable payoff that, actually, does little to soften the blow. Managers have arrived at this club over the past five years with far loftier reputations than the Portuguese. Most have departed diminished, for all that their bank balances have benefited. Once the anger subsides, Villas-Boas might even feel relieved. One of Europe's brightest young coaches, a 34-year-old who had felt such a breath of fresh air upon his appointment last summer, has been broken by Chelsea. He was as manic as ever in the technical area at The Hawthorns, a constant blur of bellowed instruction, but he had somehow still appeared helpless. Lonely. Even lost. Perception is everything in his position and, on Saturday, the sparkle seemed to have been snuffed out. He was deflated in defeat and appeared utterly exhausted, his eyes reddened and his voice a hoarse crackle as he contemplated what proved to be the critical setback. All the vibrancy that had marked him out at Porto felt drained, all the brave hopes he had brought with him dashed. It had taken 256 days to reduce him to this.Villas-Boas's only brush with his bosses in West Bromwich had occurred on a stairwell as he climbed to the media suite post-match, shaking hands with the chairman, Bruce Buck, who was descending towards the dressing rooms. There had been a brief exchange, the dialogue limited to a \"hard luck\" from Buck and a sigh in response from the manager, before they parted. The news, delivered by Roman Abramovich, the director Eugene Tenenbaum and the chief executive, Ron Gourlay, at Cobham yesterday, was a sacking driven by shoddy results even if the original demand to conduct an overhaul while maintaining challenges on all fronts had clearly made this the impossible job. The opposition-scout-turned-manager had arrived back at Stamford Bridge with a near perfect record, relative success at Acad\u00e9mica having been followed by very real, eye-catching triumphs with Porto. Yet, over the past few months, Villas-Boas has been deconstructed slowly in the public glare, with his attempts to reinvent this club undermined. The influential players he was always likely to marginalise at some stage have grumbled behind the scenes, challenging his authority in the process. Those selected have either been resistant or unable to grasp the subtle changes he was seeking in the team's style of play. Results rarely convinced, with the performances too often flat, the approach not as scintillating as had been promised. There has simply been no pizzazz to enjoy from this team in a league that has been illuminated at times by those above them in the table. The London side were already behind Manchester United and have been overtaken by Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur this season, and by Arsenal in recent weeks. That is not all Villas-Boas's fault. The squad has been allowed to stagnate over the stunted tenures of successive managers and needed refreshing. He was a young coach bursting with ideas and plans he wanted to implement at the club. Things that still have to be implemented. Chelsea, after all, are just as much in need of a revamp today as they were last summer. They have been crying out for someone to undertake the blood-letting since claiming the double under Carlo Ancelotti. Villas-Boas was supposed to be the antiseptic on the wound: the process might initially be painful, but it would be for the greater good. But eight months was never going to be long enough to make a proper mark, and now Villas-Boas will not be granted the chance to oversee that reinvention. He had felt the campaign slipping away from him. How could he have not? The fears had been betrayed by his demeanour in public, the David Brent-isms becoming ever more surreal and implausible. At Porto, Villas-Boas had enjoyed far more control over how the club was perceived on the outside, and the criticisms inflicted upon him here by pundits and media alike were hard to take. He was simply not used to this level of flak or scrutiny. The outbursts became increasingly inopportune as he sensed his employers' mood swing, his initial faith that he was to be backed to the hilt steadily ebbing away. His admission last Friday that Chelsea's squad bore no comparison to that at City, while brutally honest and accurate, made fascinating copy but implied criticism of Abramovich's \u00a31bn investment and can hardly have been appreciated by the players. The fact that he did not appreciate how his words would be perceived from within the club demonstrated a level of naivety. But, by then, he had lost control. The self-assurance that had lent him a glow of authority in claiming the Europa League in Dublin last May felt more like arrogance as Chelsea's season unravelled. He had departed The Hawthorns looking gaunt and defeated, striding on to the team coach with only one supporter barking out: \"I hope you get sacked in the morning.\" Considerably more among the travelling fans had launched into something similar once West Bromwich Albion had edged ahead though the manager, consumed by his desperation to conjure an equaliser, had not registered the dissent at the time. In the end, he was granted the morning to put those players who had not featured on Saturday through their paces before Abramovich cast him adrift. He will emerge stronger from this experience, though clinging to that thought will offer scant consolation for now.",

      "bodyText": "The government could raise as much as \u00a325bn by selling off assets built up to pay retirement benefits to postal workers from Royal Mail, to which it expects to gain access over the next couple of weeks. The money has been invested in shares, bonds and property by the Royal Mail Pension Plan but George Osborne is being encouraged by backbenchers to spend it on new priorities such as an infrastructure fund to build new rail and energy networks. The portfolio of assets will come available under a scheme to make Royal Mail easier to sell off by transferring its pension liabilities \u2013 and its credits \u2013 to the government once permission under competition rules is granted by Brussels. \"State aid approval is the next critical step in our plans to put Royal Mail on a secure footing. We have been working closely with the European Commission and expect a decision in the coming weeks,\" said a spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills. The BIS would not comment on the level of assets transferring to the government at this stage, nor predict what use might be made of the money. Treasury officials admitted that the \u00a325bn \u2013 still to be valued properly \u2013 would reduce public sector debt on the government's balance sheet, but they said it could not be considered a windfall because of ongoing liabilities to retired postal workers. The publicly owned Royal Mail is currently required to set aside specific financial provisions to pay for its existing 300,000 pensioners and future retirees on a continuing basis, just like a private sector company. The government does not have to do this, and so the \u00a325bn portfolio is counted as a \"surplus\" while liabilities are treated similarly to the unfunded pension schemes of the NHS or armed forces. The Royal Mail had been seen as unsellable by the state because of the \u00a34.5bn pension deficit built up after management decided to take a \"holiday\" and cease paying into the schemes. The Communications Workers Union said it was pleased that ministers were taking responsibility for the retirement funds and releasing it from the uncertainty of the current system. But it remains strongly opposed to privatisation, which, a spokeswoman said, is \"not in the interests of the company, the workers or the customers\". The Royal Mail declined to comment on the pension fund developments but the chancellor will clearly be delighted at the possibility of a windfall, which might be factored into to his thinking for the 21 March budget. Some backbenchers want any cash to prime the pump on the new road, rail and energy infrastructure that Britain needs at a time when it is trying to introduce a lower-carbon economy.",

      "bodyText": "So, where were we? In a past Open door, I began trying to set out, and bring up to date, what the corrections and clarifications column \u2013 my day job \u2013 means in practice by its endnote stating that \"the Guardian's policy is to correct significant errors as soon as possible\". Much has changed since that wording launched the column more than 14 years ago, especially the fact that corrections are now chiefly done on the web pages concerned, where a footnote is added explaining what text has been amended and what our mistake was. A selection of these items is then logged in the rolling corrections and clarifications column, which updates through the day and sits prominently atop the accuracy and standards page (theguardian.com/info/page/accuracy-and-standards). Whereas the means to correct was once highly concentrated \u2013 in the hands of the editor, the readers' editor's office, letters page editors, and the legal department \u2013 nowadays, editorial desks across the Guardian routinely correct and footnote their web pages if needed. Owning up to errors has become everyone's responsibility, not limited to the corrections column in the newspaper. That is the answer to how and where we correct and clarify (everywhere). Moving to substance now, what qualifies as significant enough to correct? Definitions are sure to keep evolving. But there is no doubt about the most significant items, thankfully rare: a finding of plagiarism; a libel, or an inaccuracy that injures someone's reputation; failure to substantiate a core \"fact\" or claim upon which a whole story essentially rests; misquoting, or manipulating quotes, so the intended meaning is highly distorted. Such cases may be the product of big lapses in sound practice or mundane daily realities: pressure of time, misunderstanding, accident. Whatever the origin, giving priority to correcting this sort of item is essential. Another group deemed significant comprises important errors of detail, the building bricks of journalism: names and places, dates, figures (where $10bn is mysteriously given as \u00a310m, say). But it is between these two groups that things get hard to codify. Much as some readers wish it to be so, correcting our errors is not an exact science. The time available to devote to any individual item varies from day to day, as does our postbag. Monday might bring three complex and urgent items; this will push aside other, very deserving, queries. The result: middle-ranking issues can languish in my (ever expanding) pending tray: not urgent enough to dominate the day, but too involved for an instant fix. This middle group usually needs time to resolve, with correspondence and research: a point of science, for instance, a question of who said what in an interview, a disputed point from colonial history, a complaint about calculations for anything from civil-service pensions to an engineering project. Unlike TV detectives, the readers' editor's office is not granted the luxury of putting Tuesday's e-postbag on hold while we finish looking into that worthwhile reader query from Monday. Swapping the world of crime at this point for life in air traffic control: I visualise the resulting system as something like the skies at Heathrow, where important but straightforward errors (misspelling of a name, garbling of a quote) can be quickly landed. Meanwhile, some serious 787-sized errors (sorry, I am now stuck seeing this aero-business through) may be flashing distress signals such that someone in the readers' editor's office sidelines other things to handle one or two important items only. From this, the losers - still circling overhead - are the not-quite-crucial middle group. These worthy \"ones that get away\" are my single biggest concern when weighing whether we live up to our policy. The truth is that, to our aim of correcting significant errors, we should probably add: \"as far as time and wo/manpower permit\". Even so, were I a reader who had written in on a reasonably substantial subject, then seen no result, I would be wondering, what gives? To this I can only answer: faced with one of the most sceptical, expert and informed bands of interrogators in the world, I wish we could do much more. Ones that got away In assessing possible errors or lack of clarity in Guardian journalism, our biggest enemy is time. Corrections staff haven't the scope to \"re-report\" a story. When we receive a reader query we think bears following up, our first step is to ask one or more journalists involved in the story (writer, editor, subeditor, picture desk, and so forth) to check again on the points raised. But by now, the journalists have started a new day with new assignments and new deadlines; the same is true in the readers' editor's office. The upshot is that some very worthwhile queries go unresolved. Here are some examples. Please do add your observations. In the coming days, I hope some of these can be laid to rest online or in the newspaper. Best wishes, Leslie \u2022 Local government redundancy: what are typical payoff terms? An analysis (Local government: Inspiration - and desperation, 24 September 2010, page 11) looked at some of the radical changes being considered by local authorities faced with big budget cuts: \"Outsourcing services on a grand scale, selling off municipal assets, merging education departments with neighbouring councils\" and so forth. It also observed: \"Change on this scale is hugely expensive. Redundancy payouts in local government \u2013 while not as generous as in the civil service \u2013 are typically equivalent to two years' salary.\" A reader objected that even for local government staff with long service, two years' redundancy pay was far above the actual limit: \"For someone aged 61 or above with 20 years' service the maximum is 30 weeks.\" The journalist went back to his source, which was more than I managed by way of follow-up research. This was a query I should have pursued to a conclusion, but allowed to gather dust. However, even for stories from 2010, every web page remains eternally today, so links to authoritative data sources are still welcome from readers in hopes we can amend the digitial page, if case proven. \u2022 Fertility treatment: how should donor levels be characterised? On 14 May 2011, Weekend magazine published a feature about conception using donated eggs (But will it feel like mine? page 42), and why many Britons went abroad for such fertility treatment: \"The loss of donor anonymity in the UK, in 2005, had resulted in a collapse in sperm and egg donor levels.\" A reader objected that while there was \"a short-term drop in egg donor registrations\" there was no collapse in sperm and egg donor levels, \"despite the best efforts of the fertility industry to convince us that there would be or has been\". Queried about this, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) answered efficiently, saying in part: \"The link here shows the number of egg donors with egg share donors and non-patient egg donors. This table here shows egg and sperm donors. You can see that there has not been a 'collapse' in the number of donors since the end of anonymity but there is no doubt that there is a shortage of donors\" \u2013 particularly, it added, egg donors. Yet there has also been an increase in the number of patients treated, as a treatment table showed. The feature writer, meanwhile, pointed out that her description of the situation was based not only on data but also on what practising doctors in the field had told her. Then this subject went into limbo in my pending file, only now to be disinterred. Should the online article be changed and footnoted to say \"a shortage\" instead of \"a collapse\"? On balance, I think so. Has that happened? Not so far. \u2022 Wind energy: scrutinising RenewableUK claim that record set A short news agency story in early January \u2013 Gales raise wind record power, 7 January, page 31 \u2013 said that \"wind farms produced 12.2% of the UK's energy demand on 28 December\". Readers rightly pointed out that we'd failed to spot that a bit of this line was nonsensical. As one put it, \"RenewableUK, the source [of the story], claimed only that wind farms met 12.2% of electricity consumption that day.\" But aside from that, he went on, \"Electricity consumed represents, on an annual basis, about 15% of the country's primary energy supply. So it seems likelier that wind farms produced less than 2% of the nation's energy demand on that day.\" Another suspected the \"record\" was not quite what it appeared, either: \"The record is expressed as a percentage of the total demand. The Wednesday after Christmas, demand might be quite low. We really need to know the MWh produced as compared with the previous record. To put this performance in context it would also help to know the minimum power produced. The article has the feel of RenewableUK cherrypicking data to spin their case. Why pick 1 December to 5 January as the time interval to report average output over? I think more questions should have been asked before printing the article.\" On our pages, this was a brief item \u2013 yet its content provides a perfect example of the significant middle-ranking item that can lose out between must-do corrections and the quick straightforward correction. Wind power is a hard-fought subject, politically, environmentally, and in business terms. Keen scrutiny of claims and figures is essential. I have got no further than recently forwarding the reader comments above to RenewableUK for its response. Can readers shed any further light? If they believe a correction is in order based on evidence and fact, how would they phrase that succinctly? (PS, the first reader added: \"The maths, if you're interested. Page 59 of the latest International Energy Agency figures gives TPES (total primary energy supply) for the UK as 197mtoe (million tons of oil equivalent). Converting that into the sort of units electricity is measured in (the IEA provides a converter here you get 2290TWh. In the same table on page 56 you will see that UK net electricity consumption in 2011 was 350TWh. So only about 15% of the UK TPES is consumed as electricity.) \u2022 Britain's education aid to Pakistan: was \u00a3650m ever a possibility? Travelling with Britain's prime minister to Pakistan in April 2011, the press corps heard David Cameron promise aid to fund 4 million school places, 90,000 teachers, and refurbishment of 8,000 schools (Terrorism fight at heart of Cameron trip to Pakistan, 6 April, page 13). The Guardian reported that this education package would total \u00a3950m. However, we soon had to correct this in the online text, after the Department for International Development told us \u00a3950m was wrong. But our online footnote said this figure was being \"provisionally reduced\" to \u00a3650m in the story text, adding: \"Further clarification is being sought.\" While our original \u00a3950m figure was too high, correspondence with DfID never managed to establish whether the potential \u00a3650m had any basis in reality either. This is an example of where we run into a dead end with an official body. And there it rests. \u2022 Tunisia: what did the law say about fraternising with tourists? After the Guardian published a short piece on Tunisia's efforts to rebuild its holiday business (Tourists wooed, 17 June 2011, page 26), a reader wrote that this article was \"wrong to state that in [President Zine el-Abidine] Ben Ali's police state local Tunisians who did not work in tourism were banned from talking to foreigners\". As soon as time permitted, the reporter \u2013 whose reference had come from a book \u2013 spoke to judges and lawyers and replied, \"indeed the reader is right\". So this was resolved thanks to good effort by the reporter, but then languished in the corrections \"pending tray\". The web page has only lately been corrected \u2013 and no correction has yet been written for the newspaper. \u2022 MMR-autism case: what did the judge say? The Guardian published a news agency story \u2013 Doctor struck off over MMR controversy appeals against ruling, 13 February, theguardian.com \u2013 about high court proceedings brought by John Walker-Smith, a former doctor at the Royal Free hospital in north London who is appealing against a General Medical Council (GMC) finding that he was guilty of serious professional misconduct. In May 2010, John Walker-Smith lost his licence to practise along with Andrew Wakefield, the doctor who triggered a global scare about the MMR vaccine. But several readers queried a key exchange reported in the news story, when the judge put a question to the doctor's counsel. The agency copy read: \"The judge asked \u2026 whether the alleged link between MMR and the vaccine 'has now been utterly disproved' in the opinion of 'respectable medical opinion'. [John Walker-Smith's counsel] said that was 'exactly' the position.\" The article went on to paraphrase the judge's next question, saying he asked \"whether that was also the case in relation to autism and some types of bowel disorder\". The Guardian asked the news agency, the legal firm representing the doctor, and the GMC as respondent: what were the judge's words, verbatim? That is, did the judge slip, and actually say 'MMR and the vaccine' \u2013 or should that read MMR and autism? Because of course MMR is the vaccine. And on the follow-up question, was the judge now asking about a link between autism and some types of bowel disorder (ie, nothing to do with MMR vaccine linking to autism and/or bowel disorder)? We needed their help because the corrections budget doesn't run to buying court transcripts. The agency kindly replied, but was unable fully to confirm the judge's words as spoken; neither was the GMC \u2013 respondent in the case \u2013 able to provide this information. We have not heard separately from the GMC's or the doctor's legal representatives. This is fairly unusual. Normally regulatory bodies take a strong interest in Guardian queries about possible errors in the published record involving them. And reporting of the early days of this appeal was sparse: the agency report is one of the few accounts. \u2022 Ampelm\u00e4nnchen: patent, design, trademark? A reader pointed to a sentence in Hats off to Ampelm\u00e4nnchen: Germany's traffic light hero turns 50 (14 October 2011, page 29) that said, \"In 1995, an enterprising west German patented the design\" of the outline of a man in a hat. But the Guardian was mixing up \"three separate intellectual property rights \", said the reader. \"Patents (protect inventions \u2013 and as they require novelty you couldn't get one for something that had been in public view for 34 years by then anyway); designs (protect the appearance of articles \u2013 and also require novelty); and trade marks (protect indications of origin of goods \u2013 and the right I suspect your enterprising west German actually obtained). Oh, and while we're on the subject, it's trade mark, not trademark.\" That seems concise and turns on use of a single word (in the Guardian style book, trademark). But it's not just a matter of definition \u2026 mainly, it will be necessary to establish what right the west German acquired specifically for the Ampelm\u00e4nnchen. This is a good example of something where airtight checks in the realm of Ampeldom will almost certainly take much more time than one imagines. It remains uncorrected.",

The Guardian reported that this education package would total \u00a3950m. However, we soon had to correct this in the online text, after the Department for International Development told us \u00a3950m was wrong. But our online footnote said this figure was being \"provisionally reduced\" to \u00a3650m in the story text, adding: \"Further clarification is being sought.\" While our original \u00a3950m figure was too high, correspondence with DfID never managed to establish whether the potential \u00a3650m had any basis in reality either. This is an example of where we run into a dead end with an official body. And there it rests.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Tunisia: what did the law say about fraternising with tourists?</strong></p> <p>After the Guardian published a short piece on Tunisia's efforts to rebuild its holiday business (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/17/tunisia-tourists-controversial-advertising-campaign\" title=\"\">Tourists wooed</a>, 17 June 2011, page 26), a reader wrote that this article was \"wrong to state that in [President Zine el-Abidine] Ben Ali's police state local Tunisians who did not work in tourism were banned from talking to foreigners\". As soon as time permitted, the reporter \u2013 whose reference had come from a book \u2013 spoke to judges and lawyers and replied, \"indeed the reader is right\". So this was resolved thanks to good effort by the reporter, but then languished in the corrections \"pending tray\". The web page has only lately been corrected \u2013 and no correction has yet been written for the newspaper.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>MMR-autism case: what did the judge say?</strong></p> <p>The Guardian published a news agency story \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/13/doctor-struck-off-mmr-appeals?fb=native&amp;CMP=FBCNETTXT9038\" title=\"\">Doctor struck off over MMR controversy appeals against ruling, 13 February, theguardian.com</a> \u2013 about high court proceedings brought by John Walker-Smith, a former doctor at the Royal Free hospital in north London who is appealing against a General Medical Council (GMC) finding that he was guilty of serious professional misconduct. In May 2010, John Walker-Smith lost his licence to practise along with Andrew Wakefield, the doctor who triggered a global scare about the MMR vaccine. But several readers queried a key exchange reported in the news story, when the judge put a question to the doctor's counsel. The agency copy read: \"The judge asked \u2026 whether the alleged link between MMR and the vaccine 'has now been utterly disproved' in the opinion of 'respectable medical opinion'. [John Walker-Smith's counsel] said that was 'exactly' the position.\" The article went on to paraphrase the judge's next question, saying he asked \"whether that was also the case in relation to autism and some types of bowel disorder\". The Guardian asked the news agency, the legal firm representing the doctor, and the GMC as respondent: what were the judge's words, verbatim? That is, did the judge slip, and actually say 'MMR and the vaccine' \u2013 or should that read MMR and autism? Because of course MMR <em>is</em> the vaccine. And on the follow-up question, was the judge now asking about a link between autism and some types of bowel disorder (ie, nothing to do with MMR vaccine linking to autism and/or bowel disorder)? We needed their help because the corrections budget doesn't run to buying court transcripts. The agency kindly replied, but was unable fully to confirm the judge's words as spoken; neither was the GMC \u2013 respondent in the case \u2013 able to provide this information. We have not heard separately from the GMC's or the doctor's legal representatives. This is fairly unusual. Normally regulatory bodies take a strong interest in Guardian queries about possible errors in the published record involving them. And reporting of the early days of this appeal was sparse: the agency report is one of the few accounts.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ampelm\u00e4nnchen: patent, design, trademark?</strong></p> <p>A reader pointed to a sentence in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/13/ampelmannchen-germany-traffic-light-50\" title=\"\">Hats off to Ampelm\u00e4nnchen: Germany's traffic light hero turns 50</a> (14 October 2011, page 29) that said, \"In 1995, an enterprising west German patented the design\" of the outline of a man in a hat. But the Guardian was mixing up \"three separate intellectual property rights \", said the reader. \"Patents (protect inventions \u2013 and as they require novelty you couldn't get one for something that had been in public view for 34 years by then anyway); designs (protect the appearance of articles \u2013 and also require novelty); and trade marks (protect indications of origin of goods \u2013 and the right I suspect your enterprising west German actually obtained). Oh, and while we're on the subject, it's trade mark, not trademark.\"</p> <p>That seems concise and turns on use of a single word (in the Guardian style book, trademark). But it's not just a matter of definition \u2026 mainly, it will be necessary to establish what right the west German acquired specifically for the Ampelm\u00e4nnchen. This is a good example of something where airtight checks in the realm of Ampeldom will almost certainly take much more time than one imagines. It remains uncorrected.</p>",

The mogul wasn't at all impressed with the report; the sentiment expressed amounted (to paraphrase somebody else in publishing) to the words \"over my dead body\". But the idea was seriously canvassed by others: on one telling it was Chase Carey and James Murdoch who reasoned that a buyer for the profitable Sun could be found easily enough and perhaps one too for the Sunday Times, although one might have to put the loss-making Times in some sort of trust. Not much may have changed in the proprietor's mind since. The Sun, he reminded us, is \"part of me\", arrests or no arrests. But Rupert Murdoch is nearly 81; the US TV executive Carey is on the up at News Corp and James Murdoch is, well, not very enthusiastic. Worn-out News Corp veterans were surprised that Carey even had the temerity to state the obvious last week: that it would attract a higher rating without newspapers. So for a moment it becomes possible to imagine that there could be a sale of the Times titles and the Sun \u2013 although for the sake of the Times (whose losses in combination with the Sunday Times were last reported at \u00a346m) it would only be realistic to contemplate a sale en bloc (with printing presses attached). There are good reasons for this not being the moment for action, though, and not just Rupert's fondness for the titles. The most obvious are the ongoing criminal and internal investigations, which are far from complete, and the easily trotted-out notion of a legal indemnity doesn't quite solve the problems if there is reputational damage to a masthead from a previous regime. In truth, the moment a transfer makes sense is if News Corp tries to bid again for Sky. Even if James Murdoch isn't chair of BSkyB, you have to believe the company will come back \u2013 at the right price: full control of more than \u00a3750m of cashflow is a prize far greater than \u00a3167m of dividend income. But the old coalition against the Sky bid hasn't gone away \u2013 and there will be a battle to come in which it will be argued (at the very least) that News Corp will not be allowed to own all of Sky and all of the newspapers. Instead, then, this is the time to manoeuvre, to position, to woo. Lord Rothermere tried for the Telegraph last time round, so he has shown some interest in the top end of the market. But his DMGT could never own the Sun for competition reasons and any further move into loss-making newspapers will have a depressing effect on the share price. Plus, so far, under his chairmanship, DMGT has balked at every major decision: think of the Telegraph bid and the aborted regionals sale. Meanwhile, the Lebedevs have to show they are for real; Geordie Greig's decision to jump from the London Evening Standard (where he nonetheless remains a shareholder) to the Mail on Sunday is quite a vote of no confidence. Elsewhere executives wonder if the roubles will keep flowing to support the Independent, whose sales are only 73,000. They may be interested, but can they be competitive? One doubts it. That leaves Richard Desmond, who has the financial firepower and the desire for the Sun. But the man who won't define ethics is not a confidence-inspiring prospect \u2013 and such a move would threaten the Daily Star. These, though, are only the easiest scenarios to imagine. Carey seems to be hinting: come to us with ideas. A great game, or just a great parlour game, has begun. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2012 because the original suggested that Geordie Greig had ceased to be a shareholder in the London Evening Standard.

      "bodyText": "President Barack Obama was more than half way through his address Sunday before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) before he mentioned the issue of the hour: Iran. That may well be because public officials tend to leave the thorniest subjects to later in their speeches. But it struck me as an apt metaphor for American Jewish reaction to the president in this white-hot election year. Here's why. Obama devoted the first and largest portion of his Aipac speech to a robust defense of his administration's policies toward Israel, essentially repeating the phrase he mastered in an interview with Atlantic magazine a few days earlier \u2013 that is, he's got Israel's back. Anyone who believes this argument will very likely believe the subsequent pledges he made about Iran, because they are logical, systematic, and hold up to the facts as presented. And those American Jews (and their evangelical Christian counterparts) who don't believe that this administration has been as staunch an ally of Israel and Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu as it should be will simply not believe Obama on Iran, either. In the end, it's a matter of trust. And politics. It's clear that Obama and Netanyahu do not trust each other in the easy, open way in which we mortals would want allied leaders to behave. Both came to office around the same time, but Netanyahu had already served a stint as prime minister of Israel, and is a shrewd political infighter, with initially more experience on the world stage than the young American president. Obama was clumsy and overreaching in his first foray into Middle East diplomacy, caught in the thicket of that region's Byzantine politics, not helped by an indecisive Palestinian leadership. But it's also fair to say that Netanyahu has never gotten along well with Democratic American presidents, and his alliances with Republicans have grown even more explicit during the time this Democrat has been in the White House. So it is possible that the personal relationship between these two leaders never would be warm and trusting. (Let's pay attention to the body language at their meeting Monday.) The question for American Jews, and the many other Americans who care about Israel, is whether that should make any difference at all. Besides being openly sympathetic to Netanyahu's position during his Aipac speech, Obama spared no effort to defend aggressively his administration's support of Israel in the political, diplomatic, economic and military spheres. He asked to be judged not only by words, but by deeds. \"So there should not be a shred of doubt by now: when the chips are down, I have Israel's back,\" he declared. And, with regards to the Palestinians, \"I make no apologies for pursuing peace.\" With that stage set, Obama then explained and defended his strategy to persuade Iran not to develop nuclear weapons: to pursue ever-tightening sanctions and international diplomatic pressure against the Islamic republic, while not ruling out a military option. The president is facing domestic pressure from a Congress that seems ever-eager to pick a fight with Iran, spurred on by some American Jewish leaders worried about Israel's security, and by Republican presidential candidates looking for a way to exploit any apparent weakness in the president. Still, Obama confidently held his ground before Aipac and warned against \"too much loose talk of war\": \"For the sake of Israel's security, America's security, and the peace and security of the world, now is not the time for bluster; now is the time to let our increased pressure sink in, and to sustain the broad international coalition that we have built.\" Whether one believes him on Iran depends on whether one believes him, period. Most Jews have done so, and, I predict, will show that they still do when it comes to November's election. Obama stepped lightly in this speech, asking nothing of Israel except to tone down the rhetoric on Iran, never mentioning the previously contentious issue of settlement activities as a legitimate obstacle to peace. Even so, that won't be enough for some American Jews, whose anxieties over Iran are being stoked by a well-funded, highly partisan rightwing campaign to discredit Obama more broadly. The president seemed to underscore that in his interview with the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, when he noted: \"This is one of the few times in the history of US-Israeli relations where you have a government from the right in Israel at the same time you have a center-left government in the United States, and so I think what happens then is that a lot of political interpretations of our relationship get projected onto this.\" It sure does. \u2022 Commenting on this article will be open for 24 hours from publication but may be switched off overnight",

Horizon, the British nuclear joint venture owned by the German power groups E.ON and RWE, is also planning a reactor for Oldbury in Gloucestershire. Horizon will decide the winner of the competition for Wylfa, in which Westinghouse, owned by Toshiba of Japan, is bidding against Areva. The document argues that awarding the contract to the world's largest reactor builder will have a detrimental effect on UK jobs. \"It will have a permanent and significantly negative impact on the UK nuclear industry, jobs, manufacturing skills, supply chains and SMEs. Westinghouse have pledged to 'buy where they build' and source 70% UK content, Areva have existing supply chains in France and their UK commitment would be significantly less.\" The document also warns that an Areva win would tie up the British nuclear market because France's state-owned EdF, a minority shareholder in Areva, is the dominant player in the UK nuclear sector. When EdF took over British Energy in 2008, it was ordered to divest the Wylfa and Oldbury sites that could house Areva reactors if they are built. \"If \u2026 Horizon select an Areva reactor for the Wylfa power station, then Areva would have complete dominance in the UK nuclear reactor market. Given EdF and Areva's common ownership, EdF would have the same control of UK nuclear sites as [when] it was made to divest the sites at Wylfa and Oldbury in 2008.\" Adding that Areva is already the reactor choice for EdF, the document states: \"If Areva are the reactor choice for Horizon this would foreclose the market to competition.\" A source close to the bidding contest said US-based Westinghouse was attempting to persuade Barack Obama to raise concerns over the process with David Cameron. A decision on who will build the Wylfa reactor is due this month. An Areva spokesman declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Ferrari do not expect to get on the podium in the opening Formula One grand prix in Melbourne on 18 March \u2013 and they admitted here on Sunday that they do not even know what is wrong with their car. The biggest team in F1 gagged their drivers, Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, from talking to the media \u2013 a PR disaster because it merely focused attention on the fact that the car is still uncompetitive at the end of the third and final testing session. They should have let the drivers talk. When their technical director, Pat Fry, took to the dais in the Ferrari motorhome at the Circuit de Catalunya he did not seem to understand the problems. At least the drivers could have shrugged them off. \"There is a lot of work to do,\" he said, a little forlornly. \"We don't really know how far behind we are at this stage. I have a few ideas about making a reasonable step but I don't know whether that will be enough.\" Asked whether the car needs a major upgrade or a minor tweak, Fry said that he does not know. \"I'm always pessimistic,\" he said. \"Realistic,\" a Ferrari spokesman interjected. Fry also admitted that a podium in the first race in Australia is unlikely. Alonso may not have been allowed to speak at the track but he did attend the Barcelona v Sporting Gij\u00f3n football match on Saturday, when he said: \"In the first races we will suffer because we are not 100%.\" He produced the second fastest time on Sunday \u2013 but failed to disguise the fact that the car has handling issues. In testing, times are largely meaningless because teams are experimenting with different options and various fuel loads. Ferrari are desperate for success this season after finishing third last year \u2013 well behind the leading teams. They managed one grand prix win, Alonso's at Silverstone, and had to counter criticism that they had been too conservative in their approach. This season a more radical design appears to have created more problems. Last season they also had tyre-warming problems. Here they have had trouble making their tyres last. The only good news for Ferrari was that it was a difficult day for the world championship favourites Red Bull. Sebastian Vettel completed only 23 laps on a day plagued by gearbox troubles and the two-time world champion finished eleventh out of the 11 drivers on the track. \"I would rather have these problems here than in Melbourne,\" Red Bull's principal, Christian Horner, said after what felt like a very long day for the Milton Keynes team. \"So far, not so good,\" Vettel said. \"We would love to be on the circuit more but this morning I had an issue. I went off track and broke the front wing and had to come in. It took quite a while to get back out and just before lunch we suffered a problem with the gearbox so we had to fix it and get back out.\" It was a much happier end to the pre-season workouts for the former world champions Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Raikkonen. Hamilton, who was sixth fastest, made up for McLaren's lack of running time on Saturday because of trouble with hydraulics by completing 115 laps as they came to terms with the upgrades fitted on the previous day. Raikkonen posted the fastest time of the winter \u2013 do not tell him that times are meaningless at this point. The 2007 world champion, making his comeback at 32 after a two-year break in rallying, showed that his talent has survived while also confirming that Lotus \u2013 who ran as Renault last season \u2013 have put together an impressive piece of machinery. Last season Lotus were the best of the midfielders. Right now they might even fancy their chances of overtaking Ferrari. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012. The original said that Ferrari had finished fourth last year. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "In Vietnam, they called it \"fragging\": the deliberate killing of a commanding officer by his own men. It happens in all wars when experienced foot soldiers lose respect for their leader and put their own survival before loyalty. And now it has happened at Chelsea. Twice. No wonder the club's ground shares its name with a famous battle in which an English army defeated invading forces. Three years ago the sergeant-majors in the dressing room were able to exert enough influence on the high command to have Luiz Felipe Scolari, a World Cup-winning coach, removed after six months in the job, having concluded that his insufficiently rigorous training sessions imperilled their chance of winning trophies. Scolari was an older figure, aged 61 at the time, with medals on his chest. Now the same forces appear to have done for a much younger commander, the 34-year-old Dom Lu\u00eds Andr\u00e9 de Pina Cabral e Villas-Boas. Having taken the job on a wave of fresh-faced confidence, the man familiarly known as AVB rapidly came to resemble a young captain, trained on the playing fields of Eton, arriving to command a battle-weary platoon at Passchendaele. Another victim of friendly fire, he lasted only a month longer than the Brazilian. This is an astonishing degree of influence for players to wield, particularly when their employer is one of the world's richest men. Evidently Roman Abramovich, who can do whatever he likes with his \u00a311bn fortune, prefers to listen to the whispers of his workers rather than put his long-term faith in the coach he hired to turn them back into a winning team. The Russian is either a firm believer in player power or a man whose own judgment and that of his closest lieutenants at Stamford Bridge \u2013 the club chairman, Bruce Buck, the chief executive, Ron Gourlay, the director Eugene Tenenbaum and close friend Eugene Shvidler, the chairman of Millhouse, Abramovich's investment company \u2013 is so faulty as to disqualify them from the stewardship of a leading football club. The Chelsea dressing room is certainly no respecter of age or class. Scolari, like his father a former professional player, was a product of football. And if Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was that rarity in English football, a middle-class manager, then AVB was in all probability unique in its modern history: an aristocrat in the dugout, his family tree including barons, viscounts and a grandmother from Cheadle, a posh Manchester suburb. She taught him English at an early age, and his near-perfect command of the language gives the lie to the belief that the only thing standing between foreign managers and Premier League success is an inability to communicate with their players and the outside world. Villas-Boas communicated all too well. His excellent manners and willingness to answer any question in considerable detail gave him the sympathetic ear of football reporters long accustomed to gnomic responses delivered with a Clydeside sneer. But the terms in which he analysed his side's performances soon came to seem technocratic and academic. Until the very end, when his honesty was equally painful, his pronouncements contradicted the evidence of the reporters' eyes, and the players came to share their scepticism. Those who came out with a public defence of AVB during the last days of his regime were not English players grateful for his fluency in their native tongue but the sizeable contingent of his fellow Portuguese speakers, led by David Luiz, the Brazilian defender. There was something of the nerdy schoolboy about him, and not just in the nervous way he constantly tightened the belt of his black raincoat, a less stylish trademark than Mourinho's grey cashmere overcoat. Despite starting his Premier League campaign with three consecutive wins, not once during his 40 competitive matches in charge did he convince observers that there was substance to his strategy and tactics. Where Mourinho had gone through three seasons without losing a league match at Stamford Bridge, October and November saw AVB's Chelsea losing successive home games 3-5 to Arsenal and 1-2 to Liverpool. His brief record with Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra and Porto may have looked promising, but at Chelsea he made so many mistakes that it is hard to know where to start. Hired with a brief to revitalise the playing staff and, if necessary, consign the older generation to history, he promoted only one of the younger players, Daniel Sturridge, while alienating the seniors, who disliked the way he sent Nicolas Anelka and Alex to train with the reserves while awaiting a transfer to other clubs. Whereas Manchester United and Juventus have brilliantly exploited the experience of Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Andrea Pirlo this season, Villas-Boas could not find an accommodation with Frank Lampard, whose resentment became a focal point for disaffection. A stronger manager would have shipped out Fernando Torres in January, rather than allowing his wounded presence on the bench to remain as a symbol that all was not well. His unconditional support for John Terry when the club captain was charged with racially abusing an opponent was poorly judged, only a notch or two below the advocacy on behalf of Luis Su\u00e1rez that brought Kenny Dalglish into disrepute. Sturridge apart, younger players were marginalised. Once upon a time the Stamford Bridge faithful would have been able to enjoy the development of the extravagantly gifted 18-year-old Josh McEachran, as they once feasted on the sight of the teenaged Alan Hudson and Ray Wilkins, but Villas-Boas sent the England Under-21 player to Swansea City on loan. Jeffrey Bruma, Patrick van Aanholt, Romelu Lukaku and Oriel Romeu were removed from first-team contention after brief consideration. Fabio Borini was sold to Roma, where he quickly earned himself a place in Italy's senior team against France last week, still only 20 years old. That is to say nothing of Villas-Boas's inability to demonstrate a talent for imbuing a team with any semblance of originality on the pitch. His 4-3-3 looked like anyone else's \u2013 very much like Mourinho's, in fact, but without the flame of authority or the spark of inventiveness. Sometimes it seemed that senior figures were included against his real wishes, simply because their omission would lead to an inconvenient amount of trouble. There was no hint of the strength of will or purpose that might have led to the forging of a new Chelsea, had he and the owner backed their beliefs and kept their nerve through what was always going to be a difficult season. The bigger mistakes, however, have been made by Abramovich, \u00a364m of them on managers alone, and who is to say that the most consequential of all was not the appointment of Villas-Boas but a dismissal that prefaced it: that of Ray Wilkins, Carlo Ancelotti's assistant, sacked without notice and apparently on a whim at the Stoke d'Abernon training ground one fateful morning in November 2010. It was a move that instantly destabilised the playing and coaching staff, leading \u2013 via the subsequent departure of Ancelotti \u2013 to the decision to hire a promising young Portuguese coach at least a year, and perhaps several, before it would have been possible to form a serious view of his ability to do a job that now looks harder than ever.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union's justice commissioner, Viviane Reding, is expected to set aggressive quotas and timetables on Monday to increase the number of women on the boards of public companies. Speaking to the Guardian before the announcement, Reding said that \"it's no secret that in countries where there are legal quotas [for representation on boards], the figures have grown substantially. In countries without obligatory quotas, progress is slow.\" She added that \"Generally, progress is very slow\", noting that at current rates it would take another 40 years for women to have equal representation on boards throughout Europe. \"I think we're slowly running out of patience everywhere in Europe,\" she said. Reding warned companies last year that she would begin steps to introduce legislation this month if she found progress to be insufficient. She is due to publish the statistics from analyses of board membership, but indicated that she didn't think that would be enough on its own. On Thursday the European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT) published the results of 31 member companies' records of female representation in \"leadership positions\", which ranged from 28.5% at Ecazcibasi Group, a Turkish industrial group, to 4% at Denmark's Moller-Maersk. Reding has called for European countries to set themselves a target of women making 30% of board members by 2015, and 40% by 2020. But so far only 24 firms have signed up. Asked to compare progress among EU member countries, Reding said: \"There are countries which are doing better than others. There is a huge diversity in Europe \u2026 you have to see where you're starting from. If you start from 15% it's easier than if you start from 5%. \"What we'll measure [in Monday's report] is the progress which has been made on the basis of where a certain country starts.\" But Reding was adamant that there are plenty of women capable of challenging at the highest level. \"It's very interesting that the major business schools of Europe have united forces because they have seen that often the best MBAs are done by women, but the best positions after the MBA are taken by men. So the business schools decided to pool the talent which is available on the market \u2013 that means very qualified women who have a lot of management experience \u2013 in order to put this pool at the disposal of those who take the decisions on the fulfilling of the vacant positions on the board. Very often we have heard that the women are not available. They are,\" she said. \"They are.\" Reding praised the report published in February 2011 by Lord Davies on the same topic in the UK. \"I met a year ago with the CEOs of the large publicly listed companies. They told me they were capable of solving the problem by themselves. \"At the same time Lord Davies came out with his report in Britain with similar, not to say identical, figures and problems and blockings.\" Now, she suggested, politicians were ready to take action, pointing to a speech by David Cameron in Stockholm in which he said that if progress on female representation did not speed up, \"having strong measures will not be taboo any more\".",

      "bodyText": "She is the very embodiment of modern Thai youth, dressed in flip-flops, T-shirt and shorts, and sipping an iced coffee with friends after university lectures. But 20-year-old Kanthoop is not just another university student. The social welfare major has been spat at, publicly denigrated, threatened by police and faces up to 15 years in jail \u2013 for little more, she says, than \"having opinions\". \"I know my case is symbolic, and I'm happy about that. There is good that comes from somebody standing up and wanting to make change \u2013 sooner or later people will start to realise that.\" To understand why Kanthoop might be so vilified is to understand Thai society. Twice a day \u2013 at 8am and 6pm \u2013 time stands still in this nation of 69 million as the national anthem sputters out of public loudspeakers and everyone is expected to stand in silent salute. The routine testifies to the adoration Thai people feel for both their nation and their king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, or Rama IX, a man so revered that many shops and homes bear his portrait. But that reverence is backed up by the world's strictest pro-monarchy regulations, which sentence anyone who insults, defames or threatens the king or his family to three to 15 years' imprisonment. Opponents argue that the law, known as Article 112, prevents healthy dialogue and is being used as a political tool to stifle dissent. Charges of lese-majesty, though in existence since 1908, have jumped since the military coup in 2006 that ousted former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, who was widely criticised for attempting to undermine the monarchy, an accusation he has long denied. In 2010 \u2013 when royalist forces bloodily battled with Thaksin supporters \u2013 478 lese-majesty charges were made and 75,000 websites blocked. Human rights groups, as well as the US, EU and UN, have voiced concern over the way the law is used. A group of Thai academics and activists, called Nitirat, have since proposed amendments to the law, but current prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin's sister, has vowed not to touch 112 \u2014 promising in January to \"protect the [royal] institution, not exploit it\". The debate has consequently been left to rage in the streets, where Nitirat's members face threats and harassment by royalists. \"This is about national security, not just about the king,\" said royalist Dr Tul Sittisomwong. \"Thai people are not that well educated \u2026 We're not that open to layers of discussion without fear of violence [regarding this subject]. The king makes peace in our society.\" But the existing \"hyper-royalism\" in Thailand has spiralled out of control and may actually be working to the detriment of the nation, said Thongchai Winichakul, a professor of south-east Asian history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who spent two years in prison after participating in a 1976 pro-democracy protest that saw over 100 demonstrators killed. \"Just look at the hyperbole [used] to describe the monarchy, the religiosity with which Thai people love the monarch and the public participation of all this royalism,\" he says. \"People are now afraid of their colleagues\" \u2014 because anyone can bring forward a charge of lese-majeste, he adds. It's an issue that Kanthoop knows well. Police began investigating her case in 2010 after she posted Facebook messages that were later cut and pasted by others, who she says distorted what she wrote and forwarded it by email to authorities. At her police summons on 11 February, Kanthoop was told that her case had been postponed to an unspecified date while police gather more evidence. If charged, she may well be 112's youngest offender, but she will probably not be the last. Last week a Thai court sentenced a 71-year-old redshirt supporter to 7\u00bd years in prison, while last year a 61-year-old was jailed for 20 years for sending defamatory text messages, and a Thai-US citizen was jailed for 2\u00bd years for translating a banned biography of the king. Kanthoop's political journey began in 2006, when she refused to stand up in the cinema for the royal anthem that plays before every film. \"That was the moment for me,\" she says. \"I decided that I have the right to stand up or not, to pay respect to whatever I believe in.\" While her highly politicised views have not won her many friends at Bangkok's Thammasat University, the only university to accept her even though she passed the entrance exams for two others, Kanthoop is not alone in her fight. A group of activists recently went on hunger strike outside the capital's criminal court to demand that those detained on charges of lese-majesty be granted bail. \"This law needs to be reviewed,\" says 20-year-old Panitan Pruksakasemsuk, whose father Somyot is one of those detained. \"Society needs to be open to change and willing to adapt to that change.\" As for Kanthoop, while the future is uncertain, her approach to it is not. \"If I have to go to jail, I will,\" she says calmly. \"Even if it's for life. But I won't plead guilty to reduce my sentence, and I won't ask for the king's pardon. I am guilty only of freedom of thought.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2012. The original referred to the postponement of a 'court date' for Kanthoop. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "There was no deja vu for the Catalans on their second trip to the heartlands of what used to be Lancashire in the space of nine days, as Wigan's dominant second-half performance snuffed out any chance of a Dragons fightback to match their remarkable win at St Helens the previous weekend. The French club, who came from 26-8 down with five tries in the last 22 minutes at Langtree Park, led 12-10 at half-time here in a far tighter and more bruising game than the final scoreline suggests. But Wigan's forwards gained the ascendancy after that \u2013 no mean feat given the size of the Catalans' pack \u2013 to lay the foundations for a fourth consecutive win secured by four unanswered tries. Josh Charnley scored two of them on the right wing, both simple finishes which take his tally for the season to nine from only five matches, pressing a strong claim for inclusion in the England training squad that will be announced this week. Whereas Sam Tomkins was the only Wigan player to appear in last autumn's Four Nations series, they seem likely to be more heavily represented this year. Wigan's captain Sean O'Loughlin and hooker Michael McIlorum are certain inclusions, and both were highly influential here, McIlorum capping another busy performance with a break to send O'Loughlin over for the fifth try. Lee Mossop has been one of the most consistent and dominant props in the Super League this season and must also be in line for promotion from the England Knights squad, but it is the second-row Gareth Hock whose selection would be the most eye-catching. Hock tested positive for cocaine shortly after winning his eighth cap in June 2009, and soon after his return from the ensuing two-year suspension he was banned for another five matches for gouging. But he is still only 28 and retains the combination of aggression and skill that has troubled Australia in the past. \"If I was Steve McNamara [the England coach] I'd certainly be looking at him,\" said Wigan's coach Shaun Wane. \"He's big, he's strong, he's skilful, and the good thing is he's far from the finished article. He played well today but he had a few errors as well, and he'll be in my office at eight o'clock tomorrow morning wanting to get better \u2014 that's why I love him so much.\" Hock also showed his toughness by returning to the field for the closing stages with a badly twisted neck that may well rule him out of next week's trip to Widnes. The Catalans, having lost their Australian veteran Steve Menzies and dropped Leon Pryce to the bench after both picked up injuries at St Helens, were further disrupted when their hooker Ian Henderson was forced off with ankle-ligament damage in the 14th minute and fell 6-2 behind to Thomas Leuluai's close-range try shortly afterwards, but then hit back with the try of the match from Scott Dureau after a dazzling blind-side move. Pat Richards scored Wigan's second try from Tomkins' long pass after Jean Philippe Baile had been penalised in possession, but Greg Mounis struggled over from acting half in first-half stoppage time to put the Catalans ahead. But Jack Hughes, a young centre who had squandered a glorious early chance, clung on to a more difficult pass from Chris Tuson for a third Wigan try which regained the lead in the 50th minute, before Tomkins laid on Charnley's first. Even for the Catalans, there was no way back from that. Wigan Warriors Tomkins; Charnley, Goulding, Hughes, Richards; Finch, Leuluai; Mossop, McIlorum, Lauaki, Hansen, Hock, O'Loughlin (capt).

Whereas Sam Tomkins was the only Wigan player to appear in last autumn's Four Nations series, they seem likely to be more heavily represented this year.</p> <p>Wigan's captain Sean O'Loughlin and hooker Michael McIlorum are certain inclusions, and both were highly influential here, McIlorum capping another busy performance with a break to send O'Loughlin over for the fifth try. Lee Mossop has been one of the most consistent and dominant props in the Super League this season and must also be in line for promotion from the England Knights squad, but it is the second-row Gareth Hock whose selection would be the most eye-catching.</p> <p>Hock tested positive for cocaine shortly after winning his eighth cap in June 2009, and soon after his return from the ensuing two-year suspension he was banned for another five matches for gouging. But he is still only 28 and retains the combination of aggression and skill that has troubled Australia in the past.</p> <p>\"If I was Steve McNamara [the England coach] I'd certainly be looking at him,\" said Wigan's coach Shaun Wane. \"He's big, he's strong, he's skilful, and the good thing is he's far from the finished article. He played well today but he had a few errors as well, and he'll be in my office at eight o'clock tomorrow morning wanting to get better \u2014 that's why I love him so much.\"</p> <p>Hock also showed his toughness by returning to the field for the closing stages with a badly twisted neck that may well rule him out of next week's trip to Widnes.</p> <p>The Catalans, having lost their Australian veteran Steve Menzies and dropped Leon Pryce to the bench after both picked up injuries at St Helens, were further disrupted when their hooker Ian Henderson was forced off with ankle-ligament damage in the 14th minute and fell 6-2 behind to Thomas Leuluai's close-range try shortly afterwards, but then hit back with the try of the match from Scott Dureau after a dazzling blind-side move.</p> <p>Pat Richards scored Wigan's second try from Tomkins' long pass after Jean Philippe Baile had been penalised in possession, but Greg Mounis struggled over from acting half in first-half stoppage time to put the Catalans ahead. But Jack Hughes, a young centre who had squandered a glorious early chance, clung on to a more difficult pass from Chris Tuson for a third Wigan try which regained the lead in the 50th minute, before Tomkins laid on Charnley's first. Even for the Catalans, there was no way back from that.</p> <p><strong>Wigan Warriors</strong> Tomkins; Charnley, Goulding, Hughes, Richards; Finch, Leuluai; Mossop, McIlorum, Lauaki, Hansen, Hock, O'Loughlin (capt). <strong>Interchange</strong> Lima, Farrell, Tuson, Flower.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Leuluai, Richards, Hughes, Charnley 2, O'Loughlin. <strong>Goals</strong>: Richards 6.</p> <p><strong>Catalan Dragons </strong>Greenshields; Blanch, Baile, Duport, Millard; Bosc, Dureau; Paea, Henderson, Casty (capt), Sa, Anderson, Baitieri. <strong>Interchange</strong> Pryce, Ferriol, Mounis, Fakir.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Dureau, Mounis. <strong>Goals</strong> Dureau 2.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> R Silverwood (Dewsbury). <strong>Att</strong> 14,464.</p>",

I'm not aware of India being a place for retired Brits to live out their final years, as the characters do, but it's a brilliant idea. Not only are older people given greater respect in India, it's also normal for families to have live-in staff (my mother was born in India). Given the enterprising nature of Indian business, I can imagine a flurry of Best Exotic Marigold-style retirement hotels popping up all over the country. None of the Indian hotels used by my company are quite like The Best Exotic Marigold: ours have doors for a start, and functional plumbing. But the hotel's mottled, peeling walls and air of fading grandeur are true to some of India's smaller boutique hotels. The film does capture some of Jaipur's wonderful atmosphere: the bustling markets, the tuk-tuks, the religious festivals. But it's a narrow, old-fashioned view. We see almost nothing of the modern, thriving city: motorways, McDonald's, the BMWs. Nor its cultural heritage: the ancient sites, the gem-makers, the astrologers. Maggie Smith's character has come to Jaipur for a hip replacement and it is true that medical tourism is a booming industry: Taj Hotels, a chain we work with, has a whole department devoted to it. You pay a fraction of what you'd pay to have the operation privately over here, and you get excellent after-care. Some of the other characters reminded me of tourists I've met over the years, too. Around 60% of our customers are over 60: they tend to have more time to spend travelling, and India is a bucket-list destination for them. Some are couples \u2013 like the one played by Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton \u2013 where one person falls in love with India, and the other isn't enjoying it at all.

I have my own vision of the capital buried deep in my memory, some time during the few weeks I spent there as a four-year-old, waiting for our Aeroflot flight to London. Someone took me to the top of a lighthouse, and the view from its height is still with me: an expanse of ocean bordered by blindingly white buildings and merging at its fringes with the sky. A whole generation of Somalis have never known that Mogadishu and instead have to watch nostalgic videos of its former glory on YouTube; the films have a dream-like quality, the camera floating over the city and looking down on pedestrians innocently, carelessly going about their business. The London conference on Somalia a week ago made me wonder if that aspic-preserved world could be brought back to life. Perceptions of the conference vary widely: some see its proposals for a new body to oversee the nation's finances and to increase the African Union force as nothing more than a colonial takeover of the state; others have a cautious hope that the end of the current venal government, and increased security across south-central Somalia, will bring a political and economic resurgence. It is hard for Somalis to put aside their cynicism after 24 years of pain and disappointment; they simultaneously live for news from Somalia but fear it too. In the greasy spoons frequented by taxi drivers, bus drivers and small businessmen, the debate over the lamb and rice is over who has been ousted from the government, which clan is up in arms over the ousting, and what retaliation is to be expected. It is rare to hear support for the al-Shabaab Islamists. They have long since alienated the majority by killing civilians in suicide bombings and harassing popular figures such as Dr Hawa Abdi, whose refugee camp was recently invaded and partly sold off by an al-Shabaab militia. However, what isn't clear is what shape they want the future Somalia to take: will it be one state or many? Will it be democratic? Will equal rights be extended to women? Will the government have a limited role or a wide range of responsibilities and powers? This summer I will be attending the International Book Festival in Somaliland, a self-declared independent state in the north. The theme will be the future. Poets will travel up from Mogadishu and novelists will bring self-published works. They will be able to travel around Hargeisa, the capital, freely and safely, the din of traffic, markets and music replacing gunfire and explosions. They will meet other Somalis from the south: destitute women begging at the bus station, wealthy businessmen buying up properties and expats getting their yearly dose of camel milk and goat meat. Is it inconceivable that in two or three years there could be a book festival in Mogadishu? That world-class artists such as Maryam Mursal and K'naan might perform in the city of their birth? I think with effective international support that future is within reach. The western focus on pirates and militants, although understandable, can seem very myopic from a Somali viewpoint; they are the symptoms of dysfunction rather than the causes of it. A UN force of 30,000 went after a few warlords in the early 1990s and only succeeded in entrenching them for a further decade. A saner and less costly strategy would be to emulate the process of reconciliation and institution-building seen in Somaliland. I have had the privilege of meeting and interviewing many people while writing my second novel about the civil war, from the gregarious wife of the former Somali ambassador to Rome who fled the country with a bullet embedded in her ankle, to an incredible doctor who refused to abandon his patients despite being targeted by kidnappers and assassins. I hope that there is a role for people like him and Dr Abdi in the forthcoming conferences on Somalia. For my part, I will remain optimistic and plan that return trip to Mogadishu.",

This was by no means the only mystery in a chart \u2013 based in part on \"an algorithm called 'eigenvector centrality'\" \u2013 whose politics top 10 was led by Paul Waugh (24,000 followers) but left out Nick Robinson (60,000) and Guido Fawkes (65,000). Still, at least the rankings lived up to the paper's name by including only one Indy contributor. \u2712To the press screening of Julian Fellowes's \u00a311m mini-series Titanic, held by ITV in an untested venue with an inadequately soundproofed roof, a too small screen, unraked seating reducing visibility, and incessant drilling noise.

The Agenda is, of course, made by ITN. In his review of the show, Monkey's esteemed colleague Mark Lawson wondered why the audience was so silent. Perhaps that explains it. \u2022 This article originally stated that the TalkSport feature was in Arena. This was incorrect and now has been amended to state it was actually in Esquire.",

But which reach the small screen first?*</p> <p>\u2712 Last week's <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-twitter-100-no-1-to-10-7466795.html\" title=\"\">Twitter 100, the Independent's annual rankings</a>, yielded places for the Guardian's Ben Goldacre (33), Jonathan Freedland (49), Andrew Sparrow (54), Charles Arthur (56), George Monbiot (67) and Alan Rusbridger (77) \u2013 though not, puzzlingly, for Patrick Butler and Jack Schofield, who shared with Miranda Hart the bizarre distinction of making the 100's Sgt Pepper-style cover in photo form without actually appearing in the league table. This was by no means the only mystery in a chart \u2013 based in part on \"an algorithm called 'eigenvector centrality'\" \u2013 whose politics top 10 was led by Paul Waugh (24,000 followers) but left out Nick Robinson (60,000) and Guido Fawkes (65,000). Still, at least the rankings lived up to the paper's name by including only one Indy contributor.</p> <p>\u2712To the press screening of Julian Fellowes's \u00a311m mini-series Titanic, held by ITV in an untested venue with an inadequately soundproofed roof, a too small screen, unraked seating reducing visibility, and incessant drilling noise. Had it taken place at Downton Abbey, some hacks suggested, Carson would have been given his marching orders by Lord Grantham.</p> <p>\u2712Eagle-eyed viewers of Tom Bradby's new ITV1 show The Agenda on Monday night spotted one particularly interested audience member, namely ITN's chief executive, John Hardie. The Agenda is, of course, made by ITN. In his review of the show, Monkey's esteemed colleague Mark Lawson wondered why the audience was so silent. Perhaps that explains it.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;This article originally stated that the TalkSport feature was in Arena. This was incorrect and now has been amended to state it was actually in Esquire. </p>",

Two separate polls on Sunday show strong support for a \"yes\" vote in the referendum announced last week by the taoiseach, Enda Kenny. A survey by Millward Brown Landsdowne for the Sunday Independent found 37% would vote yes, 26% would oppose the treaty and 15% were yet to make up their minds. Among voters who had already decided, the poll found 59% were in favour of the treaty compared with 41% opposed. A Red C poll in the Dublin Sunday Business Post found that 44% of respondents would vote yes in the referendum, 26% would vote no and another 26% were yet to make up their minds. The leader of Ireland's main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il called this weekend for the country to ratify the fiscal compact. Speaking at his party's annual conference in Dublin, Micheal Martin said his party would campaign for a yes vote. Martin also backed the Fine Gael-Labour government's view on distinguishing between the referendum and the campaign to reduce Ireland's debt burden. \"I don't believe in conditionality in terms of the promissory note,\" he said. \"I do think it should be dealt with, but separate to the treaty. I do think it will be dealt with ultimately.\" The Fianna F\u00e1il leader also used his conference speech to apologise for the party's mistakes while in government between 1997 and 2011. \"It's not enough to point to the worst world recession in 80 years and the eurozone crisis, nor to point to the fact that other parties were demanding policies which would have made things worse.

No half-apology. Just the plain, unvarnished truth,\" he told delegates. While Martin can expect some positive bounce from the weekend conference \u2013 its first since his historic defeat at the ballot box last year - the presence of former prime minister Bertie Ahern at the gathering was a reminder that the errors of the recent past could cause Fianna F\u00e1il some further damage.

      "bodyText": "Stalking will be recognised as a crime for the first time in England and Wales under legislation expected to be announced by the prime minister this week. At a private meeting last month, officials from the Home Office, Crown Prosecution Service, attorney general's office, ministry of justice and the police were told that David Cameron planned to use this Thursday's International Women's Day to announce reform to legislation affecting stalking and domestic violence offences. The prime minister is expected to use a reception at Downing Street to announce stalking is to become an imprisonable offence, carrying a sentence of up to six months and a \u00a35,000 fine. More serious cases will incur sentences of up to five years and an unlimited fine. \"I'm confident that we will get a positive message on Thursday from the prime minister that there will be changes to the law on stalking,\" said Robert Buckland, the Conservative MP who helped launch an independent parliamentary inquiry into stalking law reform. \"The government is persuaded of the need for change,\" Buckland added. \"They are listening and the signs are encouraging that, when the Freedom Bill is given its third reading on March 12th, there will be new and improved, strengthened and toughened legislation that criminalised stalking.\" Cameron has invited the key advisers to the inquiry's campaign team to Thursday's reception, including chair Elfyn Llwyd and Tricia Bernal, whose daughter, Clare, was shot and killed in Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge, London. Clare was murdered by her obsessed former boyfriend, Michael Pech, who had been previously charged with harassing his former girlfriend. Pech breached his bail conditions to murder Clare Bernal, before killing himself. Also invited to Thursday's reception is Claire Waxman, who was awarded \u00a33,500 damages last month after the high court criticised the criminal prosecution service for failing to protect her from an eight-year campaign of \"serious and persistent\" harassment by freelance television producer Elliot Fogel. Llwyd said the government's intention to introduce new legislation appears to be \"fairly solid,\". \"I'm quietly confident,\" he said. \"The prime minister would not invite us all to Downing Street on Thursday just to slap us down.\" There are an estimated 120,000 cases of stalking every year but just 4,365 people were convicted of harassment in 2009, and of those, just 565 were jailed. The figure for those found guilty of stalking is even smaller. Last year, 786 people were found guilty of the more serious offence of putting a person in fear of violence. Of those, 170 were jailed. The statistics have raised concerns that the Protection from Harassment Act is failing to shield women. \"The evidence that we need a specific offence of stalking is overwhelming,\" said Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union. \"Victims are not being taken seriously by the police or CPS. Perpetrators rarely receive custodial sentences or are treated. This is a scandal that must end without delay.\" A cross-party group of 120 parliamentarians believe, however, that legislation alone is not sufficient to protect victims. Tracey Morgan, a member of the inquiry panel stalked by a former colleague for nearly 10 years, said that fundamental changes to training, risk assessment of victims and treatment, including the establishment of a victims' advocacy scheme to signpost and support victims of stalking through the criminal justice system, are also necessary. \"We have to improve awareness and culture around stalking as well as the law,\" she said. : \"Stalking is where domestic violence was 30 years ago. It's seen as a joke; a celebrity problem. Victims are told they should be flattered by the attention. But stalking can lead to murder, rape and a range of other, horrific crimes. For too long, it has not been treated with the seriousness it deserves. I am optimistic now that this is going to change.\"",

      "bodyText": "Paul McBride, one of Scotland's best-known criminal lawyers, has been found dead in a hotel in Pakistan midway through the trial of two men accused of sending him a parcel bomb. A prominent and outspoken QC, McBride was allegedly sent a device along with Neil Lennon, the Celtic football club manager, a senior Labour politician and an Irish republican group by Trevor Muirhead and Neil McKenzie, from Ayrshire. Their trial in Glasgow heard last week that McBride, 46, had been sent what appeared to be a petrol-based parcel bomb. Muirhead and McKenzie have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to murder. McBride, 46, who was understood to be advising Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor and Downing Street communications chief, about the phone hacking scandal, was found dead in his hotel room in Lahore on Sunday morning by his close friend and colleague Aamer Anwar. McBride's unexpected death stunned the Scottish legal profession and senior political figures. Scotland's two senior law officers, Frank Mulholland QC, the lord advocate, and Lesley Thomson, the solicitor advocate, said he would be \"sorely missed.\" It must have been \"devastating news\" for McBride's partner Gary, they added. \"Paul was in the prime of his life,\" they said. \"He lived life to the full and had contributed so much to the legal profession, the media and public life in Scotland. He had a fabulous intellect and was interested in so many things. He was a fearless advocate who was not afraid to speak out about injustice and intolerance.\" Friends said he was very compassionate and generous, yet was \"lethal\" cross-examining witnesses. David McKie, a solicitor who often instructed McBride and last spoke to him on Friday, said: \"He would take on the establishment and he did it fearlessly, even without considering the impact on his popularity and reputation.\" Anwar had last seen McBride at a wedding where the pair had met Pakistani government ministers and senior police officers. McBride had flown to Lahore for several days after taking a brief break from a holiday with his parents in Abu Dhabi. Speaking from Lahore, Anwar said McBride had been feeling unwell and queasy for several days, and had gone back to the hotel early on Saturday to rest. Anwar raised the alarm with hotel security guards on Sunday morning after failing to reach McBride by phone several times. \"I had phoned him last night, and there was no answer and phoned him this morning several times,\" Anwar said. After forcing hotel staff to allow him into McBride's room, he said he found him lying in his bed, where he looked asleep. McBride and Anwar worked together in the trial of Tommy and Gail Sheridan for perjury at the high court in Glasgow in late 2010, where McBride appeared for Gail Sheridan and successfully defended her against several charges of lying on oath to help her husband. Well known in the Scottish media for giving legal advice on stories, McBride was also given a column in the Scottish edition of the new Sun on Sunday tabloid; in his final column for its edition on Sunday, he railed against critics of new legislation outlawing sectarian and racist behaviour at football matches. McBride said the law would make Scotland a safer and more tolerant society. McBride was also politically active; touted as a possible UK law officer in a Tory government; he resigned from the Scottish Conservative party in protest at the election of Ruth Davidson as its leader late last year. The Muirhead and McKenzie trial heard last week that a postman had become extremely suspicious about a parcel addressed to McBride after noticing it was smelling very strongly of petrol. Police officers said the device contained nails, a clear bottle filled with liquid, and wires leading to an apparent timer. McBride was one of the youngest lawyers ever to be made Queen's counsel, at the age of 35, and was a member of the Scottish legal aid board. In a statement issued on behalf of McBride's family, their spokesman, Jack Irvine, said: \"Paul died in his sleep last night in a hotel in Pakistan and at this time we would ask you to respect the privacy of his family. \"The family have asked that they are not troubled at this distressing time.\" David Mundell, the Tory MP and Scotland Office minister, said McBride was \"a fiercely intelligent individual who was as passionate about politics as he was the law. Paul was a towering presence in Scottish public life, who was never afraid to speak out on the issues he cared about.\" Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, said McBride was \"an outstanding advocate\", adding: \"His reservoir of talent was great indeed, and I believe he had so much more to contribute to the law, and to the great debate on Scotland's future. Paul will be sorely missed across Scotland's legal system, political parties, sport and journalism.\"",

      "body": "<p>Paul McBride, one of Scotland's best-known criminal lawyers, has been found dead in a hotel in Pakistan midway through the trial of two men accused of sending him a parcel bomb.</p> <p>A prominent and outspoken QC, McBride was allegedly sent a device along with Neil Lennon, the Celtic football club manager, a senior Labour politician and an Irish republican group by Trevor Muirhead and Neil McKenzie, from Ayrshire.</p> <p>Their trial in Glasgow heard last week that McBride, 46, had been sent what appeared to be a petrol-based parcel bomb. Muirhead and McKenzie have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to murder.</p> <p>McBride, 46, who was understood to be advising Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor and Downing Street communications chief, about the phone hacking scandal, was found dead in his hotel room in Lahore on Sunday morning by his close friend and colleague Aamer Anwar.</p> <p>McBride's unexpected death stunned the Scottish legal profession and senior political figures. Scotland's two senior law officers, Frank Mulholland QC, the lord advocate, and Lesley Thomson, the solicitor advocate, said he would be \"sorely missed.\" It must have been \"devastating news\" for McBride's partner Gary, they added.</p> <p>\"Paul was in the prime of his life,\" they said. \"He lived life to the full and had contributed so much to the legal profession, the media and public life in Scotland. He had a fabulous intellect and was interested in so many things. He was a fearless advocate who was not afraid to speak out about injustice and intolerance.\"</p> <p>Friends said he was very compassionate and generous, yet was \"lethal\" cross-examining witnesses. David McKie, a solicitor who often instructed McBride and last spoke to him on Friday, said: \"He would take on the establishment and he did it fearlessly, even without considering the impact on his popularity and reputation.\"</p> <p>Anwar had last seen McBride at a wedding where the pair had met Pakistani government ministers and senior police officers. McBride had flown to Lahore for several days after taking a brief break from a holiday with his parents in Abu Dhabi.</p> <p>Speaking from Lahore, Anwar said McBride had been feeling unwell and queasy for several days, and had gone back to the hotel early on Saturday to rest. Anwar raised the alarm with hotel security guards on Sunday morning after failing to reach McBride by phone several times.</p> <p>\"I had phoned him last night, and there was no answer and phoned him this morning several times,\" Anwar said. After forcing hotel staff to allow him into McBride's room, he said he found him lying in his bed, where he looked asleep.</p> <p>McBride and Anwar worked together in the trial of Tommy and Gail Sheridan for perjury at the high court in Glasgow in late 2010, where McBride appeared for Gail Sheridan and successfully defended her against several charges of lying on oath to help her husband.</p> <p>Well known in the Scottish media for giving legal advice on stories, McBride was also given a column in the Scottish edition of the new Sun on Sunday tabloid; in his final column for its edition on Sunday, he railed against critics of new legislation outlawing sectarian and racist behaviour at football matches.

      "bodyText": "The German government has run out of patience. It was obvious at the EU summit on Friday when the German delegation let it be known that the second rescue package for Greece must be the final word. If it proves too small, and Greece cannot afford to pay public sector wages, then it must default on its debts. Talking to senior German negotiators last week, I found a change in attitude that was shocking for its clear and cold-hearted resolution. Not so long ago Berlin was concerned to be viewed as a champion of European unity. There was a genuine fear that a Greek default would terminate 50 years of building towards a European super state. Now Greece, in its enfeebled state, fails two tests. First, German officials are convinced it remains riddled with corruption, grift and racketeering such that it is impossible to make any agreements stick. Second, there is a better firewall to protect the eurozone from further shocks. The firewall is the \u20ac440bn European financial stability facility and the prospect of accelerated payments by member states into its successor the ESM, which is enough to insure against a Greek bankruptcy when placed alongside the \u20ac219bn of sovereign loans by the European Central Bank and \u20ac1 trillion in ECB loans to tide the banking system through the worst of the crisis. With a firewall in place and no confidence Athens can implement a serious reform agenda, Greece is robbed of its negotiating power. \"There is no standing still for Greece. It must either move forward with reforms or leave,\" said one official. This leaves Greece in an impossible position. With sky-high debts, a five year recession stretching into at least another two and loan interest to pay, there is no way Athens can meet Brussel's demands. Even after the deal to write down its private sector debt to 120% of GDP, the economic situation can only improve with the kind of asset fire sale and mass wage cuts that leaves the political situation desperately unstable. As Terry Smith of money broker Tullet Prebon recently wrote: \"Greek budget numbers show government revenue decreased 4.9% in January and spending rose 8%. Revenues fell from \u20ac5.122bn to \u20ac4.872bn. Spending rose from \u20ac4.967bn to \u20ac5.362bn. Apparently this is a different budget to the one that the Euro budget police look at.\" The German finance ministry under Wolfgang Schaeuble knows it has failed to put Greece in a sustainable position \u2013 with a platform from which it can bring forward reforms \u2013 but it doesn't care. In a tragi-comic twist, the view from Berlin echoes that of many Greeks, including Taki, the Spectator's High Life columnist, who took time out in his 25 February article to document his compatriots' faults. He said: \"They still believe in the most thieving politicians this side of Nigeria,\" who, in turn, protect a vast army of overpaid civil servants that operate through patronage and bribes. The German foreign ministry is of a similar view. Zsolt Darvas, an economist at the Breugel research institute in Brussels agrees that the Germans have done enough to isolate Greece, but says their argument that the eurozone can now plan for growth is flawed. There are the Spanish youth unemployment figures, at 49.9%. No wonder prime minister Mariano Rajoy has already told his German counterpart Angela Merkel he needs respite from her demands for cuts. Not for more than a century has medical science recommended bleeding patients to make them better, yet some economic scientists cling to this remedy. Germans, keen to protect their wealth, are slavish adherents. In Italy, where a clampdown on spending has brought plaudits, unemployment is rising and national politics is becoming more polarised. The technocrat in charge, Mario Monti, has plans to end age-old restrictive practices, but there are plenty of politicians in Silvio Berlusconi's party and the leftist New Democracy waiting to wreck them: not because they are delinquent, but because they represent people who will suffer huge falls in living standards. Portugal, the Germans reassure themselves, is knuckling down in a way the Greeks can only dream of. Likewise the Irish. Yet while many Irish politicians consider the pain of austerity a much deserved penance for past sins, the Portuguese are clear they have nothing to apologise for. Willem Buiter, chief economist at Citigroup, points out that weaker members of the eurozone collectively need to borrow some \u20ac2tn over the next two years. He argues that the only way to borrow this sum is for a more collective plan. One that entails some form of joint liability for countries' debts. \"A proposal from the German council of economic experts for a European debt redemption fund, which would mutualise all eurozone members' debts above 60% of GDP, with strict rules to pay them off over 25 years, is gaining traction in some quarters. Germany itself remains staunchly opposed to anything that smells of Eurobonds, and the current period of calm has only reinforced that resistance.\" Everything the Germans want could be undone without a more forgiving attitude. If the EU presses ahead with fines for countries that fail to meet new tough deficit targets, the riots in Barcelona last week could be the first round in a widespread revolt.",

Despite the relaxed policy about audience chit-chat, the predominantly young audience remained attentive during some very challenging music. The main challenges of the 2012 edition's closing concert, with the London Contemporary Orchestra led by the talented Hugh Brunt, came not from the music's content but its length. Two of the pieces \u2013 Gabriel Prokofiev's new 25-minute Concerto for Bass Drum and Orchestra and Jonny Greenwood's recent 23-minute orchestral piece Doghouse \u2013 would have benefitted enormously from some properly wielded scissors. Doghouse finds Greenwood producing some nice effects, but the leaden momentum gave the effect of rambling through Britten's score for The Turn of the Screw. The Prokofiev was more exciting and featured some fascinating touches, such the gentle adaptation of the lion's roar (manipulating a string attached to the skin of the drum), and in general did a good job of showing the softer, subtler side of the bass drum. But the lack of focus and direction lent a worrying flaccidity even to the most strongly rhythmic passages focus. There was nonetheless something very satisfying about the programme, which opened and closed with excellent performances of Xenakis's early Metastasis and Claude Vivier's wonderful meditation on Orion from 1979. The former work is a masterclass in musical monolithics and the latter an object lesson in dazzling the listener with intense textural variety. Great lessons; now we just need to learn from them.",

      "bodyText": "England may still be under a caretaker management when they go on a three-Test tour to South Africa in June after the Rugby Football Union's chief executive Ian Ritchie admitted it was unlikely that Martin Johnson's successor would be named by the end of the Six Nations. Stuart Lancaster, the interim head coach for the championship, will be interviewed within the next week for the permanent position. He is one of three candidates on the shortlist but a decision appears more likely to be later than sooner. \"What I've said is that, in an ideal world, and I stress even that, we would like to have someone in place to coach on the tour to South Africa in the summer,\" said Ritchie on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday, before adding: \"There is no magic date that we have to appoint anyone by.\" England have improved immeasurably from the ruins of last year's World Cup, which was not only their most unsuccessful on the field for 12 years but which was also marred by a number of incidents off the pitch that prompted an official review that was concluded after Johnson resigned as team manager. Ritchie said that he would be prepared to wait until after the start of next season by which time Wayne Smith, the former New Zealand attack coach who has experience of the English game after spending three years as Northampton's director of rugby, will be free to exercise an opt-out clause with Waikato Chiefs. The former South Africa coach Nick Mallett has long been the favourite to succeed Johnson but having spent eight years coaching Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Italy, he has been agonising over whether to uproot himself again having only returned home after the World Cup. \"The primary function is getting the best person,\" Ritchie said. \"The date is not the be all and end all but I want to move forward on it as quickly as we can. Stuart is doing a good job in putting his best foot forward and what you have to do is make the best assessment you can overall. Comments that Stuart will get the job if England win three matches in the Six Nations and that he won't if they lose three are simplistic.\" England's one defeat in their three matches under Lancaster came against Wales at Twickenham in the last round, and they were denied the chance of a draw when David Strettle's late claim for a try was ruled out by the video official Iain Ramage. England face France in Paris on Sunday (11 March) with Les Bleus looking for a victory that would set them up for a title decider against Wales in Cardiff on the final weekend \u2013 only the Welsh can now win the grand slam after Ireland's draw in the rearranged game at Stade de France .",

      "body": "<p>England may still be under a caretaker management when they go on a three-Test tour to South Africa in June after the Rugby Football Union's chief executive Ian Ritchie admitted it was unlikely that Martin Johnson's successor would be named by the end of the Six Nations.</p> <p>Stuart Lancaster, the interim head coach for the championship, will be interviewed within the next week for the permanent position. He is one of three candidates on the shortlist but a decision appears more likely to be later than sooner.</p> <p>\"What I've said is that, in an ideal world, and I stress even that, we would like to have someone in place to coach on the tour to South Africa in the summer,\" said Ritchie on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday, before adding: \"There is no magic date that we have to appoint anyone by.\"</p> <p>England have improved immeasurably from the ruins of last year's World Cup, which was not only their most unsuccessful on the field for 12 years but which was also marred by a number of incidents off the pitch that prompted an official review that was concluded after Johnson resigned as team manager.</p> <p>Ritchie said that he would be prepared to wait until after the start of next season by which time Wayne Smith, the former New Zealand attack coach who has experience of the English game after spending three years as Northampton's director of rugby, will be free to exercise an opt-out clause with Waikato Chiefs.</p> <p>The former South Africa coach Nick Mallett has long been the favourite to succeed Johnson but having spent eight years coaching Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Italy, he has been agonising over whether to uproot himself again having only returned home after the World Cup.</p> <p>\"The primary function is getting the best person,\" Ritchie said. \"The date is not the be all and end all but I want to move forward on it as quickly as we can. Stuart is doing a good job in putting his best foot forward and what you have to do is make the best assessment you can overall. Comments that Stuart will get the job if England win three matches in the Six Nations and that he won't if they lose three are simplistic.\"</p> <p>England's one defeat in their three matches under Lancaster came against Wales at Twickenham in the last round, and they were denied the chance of a draw when David Strettle's late claim for a try was ruled out by the video official Iain Ramage.</p> <p>England face France in Paris on Sunday (11 March) with <em>Les Bleus</em> looking for a victory that would set them up for a title decider against Wales in Cardiff on the final weekend \u2013 only the Welsh can now win the grand slam after Ireland's draw in the rearranged game at Stade de France .</p>",

      "bodyText": "Martin O'Neill's first Tyne-Wear derby did not end with the traditional drink in Alan Pardew's office after the two managers became embroiled in some unseemly touchline exchanges. \"I think I shall go and climb on the bus,\" said O'Neill, after he was asked if he and Newcastle's manager were poised for a friendly chat. \"I wanted to have a glass of wine with Martin but I'm told he's gone,\" said Pardew. \"Silly things got said on the bench, it got out of hand and it was unsavoury but it happens. \"It's a passionate game but maybe I could have been a bit more grown-up about it. Maybe Sunderland's bench handled it better. If one or two of us stepped over the line I'll apologise for it.\" Newcastle's manager evidently said something provocative to his Sunderland counterpart as he leapt towards O'Neill, celebrating wildly, after the home side won a second-half penalty missed by Demba Ba. \"I've never done that before,\" conceded Pardew whose goalkeeping coach, Andy Woodman, was sent to the stands by the referee at half-time. \"It looks terrible but it was just sheer relief we'd got a penalty. Unless you're a manager or a player you don't understand the pressure of this game, a lot of emotion was involved. I was really frustrated.\" Pardew, who claimed Lee Cattermole's idiotic lunge on Cheik Tiot\u00e9 after just 45 seconds had been \"premeditated\", rebutted O'Neill's suggestion that members of Newcastle's backroom staff had visited Mike Dean, the referee, at half-time. \"I can tell you it's completely untrue,\" he said. \"None of our staff are allowed in the ref's room. It's not right.\" Cattermole, the Sunderland captain, was sent off for directing foul and abusive language at Dean after the final whistle. \"Lee can't be doing that, he should leave it to me,\" said O'Neill. \"But Lee's mitigating circumstance is that he felt too many decisions had gone Newcastle's way in the second half. They should count themselves lucky to have finished with 11 men. Cheik Tiot\u00e9 should have been sent off.\" O'Neill said he had \"no complaints\" about St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon's red card for elbowing Tiot\u00e9 before enthusing about the occasion. \"The derby was absolutely everything people have told me \u2013 the hostility, the fervour, everything. It's two points slipped through our fingers but, in a perverse way, I enjoyed it.\" Pardew had high praise for Shola Ameobi, scorer of the equaliser, and Hatem Ben Arfa whose half-time introduction changed the game's complexion. \"I love Shola to bits, the chance couldn't have fallen to a better person,\" he said. \"He brings important qualities passed down from his parents to this club. Some of Hatem's play was breathtaking; it was his best 45 minutes for us. I have to find a way of getting him in my team.\"",

Like much of Goebbels's music, it is at once radical and eclectic. Orchestral music and vocals blend with electronics. The running order of its disparate movements is ultimately the decision of its performers, but whichever way it is played, it reveals a powerful unity of vision. It engages in an on-going dialogue with the Austro-German musical tradition, incorporating elements of jazz and blues into a score that is Mahlerian in scale and scope and that glances more than once at the earlier cityscapes of Berg and Weill. The piece was originally written for a youth orchestra, the Junge Deutsche Philharmonie, and the long overdue London premiere, part of the Music Nation weekend, was appropriately given by young musicians. Jonathan Stockhammer conducted the Trinity Laban Symphony Orchestra, augmented by members of the National Youth Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra's Foyle Future Firsts scheme. Stockhammer exerted an iron control over the proceedings, so you could hear plenty of detail, even when the music was at its most violent. Paradoxically, it is when Goebbels relaxes the tensions, that you notice the occasional flaws, and in this instance, the central movement, Sampler Suite, felt over-long. David Moss and Jocelyn B Smith were the familiar soloists: his eerie sprechstimme is the perfect contrast to her bluesy utterances. The orchestra was the real star, however, playing with terrific enthusiasm. The percussionists in particular, whirling vertiginously on a gallery above the tiers of musicians below, deserved a medal.",

      "bodyText": "Stuart Lancaster may need a few more things to go his way if he is to be confirmed as the next England coach, but the Cumbrian's happy knack of making the right calls continued yesterday when England's hopeful half-backs, Ben Youngs and Toby Flood, finally showed flashes of the form that has been absent so far this Six Nations. Sent back by Lancaster to gain game time with Leicester, Flood and Youngs \u2013 building on a huge effort by the Tigers pack \u2013 also helped turn what should have been a difficult afternoon in the cold and wet East Midlands into something approaching a cakewalk, mastering the dire conditions while gathering 16 points between them. As Richard Cockerill, Leicester's director of rugby, said later: \"They've had a bit of stick in the past few weeks, but we know they are quality players even though they have not been quite as sharp as they would like to be. It was a perfect day for Ben and Toby. After where they have been in the last few weeks, it was very good for them. They wanted to prove a point, which was obviously good for Leicester.\" After a shaky start to the season Leicester have now won all but one of their league games since their names returned after the World Cup. Gloucester are clinging to sixth spot and the final Heineken place. The last time they were at Welford Road the teams shared 82 points, but their recent run of fortune started to desert them even before kick-off. Already without the cutting edge of Henry Trinder and James Simpson-Daniel, Gloucester lost the wing Charlie Sharples 30 minutes before the start, when the England squad member failed a fitness test on a tweaked calf muscle. Whether that takes the heat off Chris Ashton ahead of England's trip to Paris on Sunday is another matter; yesterday with its driving rain and bitter wind was not the day to test out an injury. Nor was it a day to be under a high ball as another England prospect, Jonny May, discovered in the move which lead up to Leicester's first try. First Flood put up a teasing free kick that the full-back could only parry to Matt Smith who, in turn, put Thomas Waldrom away. The Kiwi, another released by Lancaster, slid into touch at the corner but then drove round a ruck to set up the springboard from which the Samoan prop Logovi'i Mulipola claimed the five points. With Youngs managing a rapid and accurate service and Flood precise with his kicking, Gloucester remained under the cosh and nine minutes later conceded a second. Again it was a Flood kick which set up the try. It came when Steve Mafi rose at a lineout and landed with no one between him and the line. Next Flood got to within a whisker of a try himself, taking a crisp ball from Youngs only to be stopped inches short. A penalty was poor compensation, but after 30 minutes Leicester were 15-3 up and about to prove their dominance through Youngs. Again the issue went to the video referee, but this time he confirmed that the scrum-half had built up sufficient momentum from his tapped penalty to carry him over. Flood continued the double act and the first half ended with Leicester holding an emphatic 19-point advantage. As Flood suggested, the first 40 minutes had been particularly good for Youngs. \"He's been a bit frustrated of late and I think that has showed,\" the fly-half said. \"It was great to come out and have a run. You come back to Leicester and just get on with it.\" The big surprise was that the bonus-point try took 17 minutes of the second half in coming and that, for once, neither Flood nor Youngs were involved. The Gloucester-bound Billy Twelvetrees, building on the good work of the forwards, chipped through the cover for Matt Smith to score before Alesana Tuilagi completed a day Gloucester will want to forget, the wing catching May's poor chip and going 80 metres unopposed. \"We're going to have two weeks to stew on that before we play again,\" said the captain Mike Tindall, one of those England players no longer in Lancaster's plans. \"We were in a good position coming into the game and it's disappointing to have let ourselves down.\" Leicester Murphy (capt, S Hamilton, 59); Agulla, Smith, Twelvetrees, Tuilagi; Flood (Ford, 67), Youngs; Ayerza (Stankovich, 61), Chuter (Hawkins, 65), Mulipola (White, 61), Skivington, Kitchener, Mafi (Pienaar, 72), Salvi, Waldrom (Newby, 65).

      "bodyText": "Preamble Hello. Spurs have busted some major ghosts under Harry Redknapp. They have won at Arsenal for the first time since 1993; they've won a league game at Anfield for the first time since 1993; they've beaten Chelsea in consecutive league seasons for the first time since 1990; they've played in the European Cup for the first time since 1962; they've stopped buying complete donkeys for huge fees. Now they are in with a great chance of finishing as the highest London club for the first time since 1995 \u2013 particularly if they beat Manchester United for the first time since 2001 at White Hart Lane this afternoon. Spurs' Premier League record against United is nothing short of pathetic: P39 W3 D8 L28 Pts 17. Despite that, United would surely be happy enough with a draw today. It would leave them four points behind Manchester City, but this is the last of a really tough run of fixtures. And the next eight league games are eminently winnable. It would have seem absurd at 2.09pm last Sunday, but Spurs also have one eye on their local rivals. If they lose today they will be only four points ahead of Arsenal, and squeaky-bum time will have officially begun. Kick off is at 4.10pm. 4.10pm! Pre-match reading Here's an old Joy of Six on this fixture. It includes Eric Cantona, George Best, Gary Lineker and, yep, Pedro Mendes. Spurs haven't beaten United since 2001. This much we know. What's often forgotten is that it was a bit of a dead rubber, on the last day of the season. In a sense, Spurs' last win over United was the raucous 3-1 victory in 1999-2000. It was the first time United had lost a Premier League after scoring first. Paul Scholes scored an own goal, while Steffen Iversen and Stephen Carr scored the greatest goals of their careers. Team news Welsh superhero Gareth Bale isn't fit, not even for the bench. He has a virus, apparently. Luka Modric may play from the left instead. Both teams are without their bionic wingers, because Antonio Valencia is not fit for United. Wayne Rooney does return, with Ashley Young surprisingly preferred to Ryan Giggs. Louis Saha and Michael Carrick play against their former clubs. Dimitar Berbatov doesn't; he's not in the squad. Tottenham Hotspur (4-4-2) Friedel; Walker, Kaboul, King, Assou-Ekotto; Lennon, Livermore, Sandro, Modric; Adebayor, Saha. Subs: Cudicini, Giovani, Defoe, Dawson, Kranjcar, Rose, Nelsen. Manchester United (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Jones, Evans, Ferdinand, Evra; Carrick, Scholes; Nani, Rooney, Young; Welbeck. Subs: Amos, Anderson, Giggs, Park, Hernandez, Fabio, Rafael. Referee Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) You know how good Ryan Gosling looks in Drive? You know how cool that jacket is? Well, don't. Just don't. It's not football. But look at this catch. 3.47pm \"In the other MBM Steinberg proposed to soundtrack Wolves' performance with the Benny Hill theme tune, the sarcy devil,\" says Phil Podolsky. \"Other apposite footballing soundtracks? I'd love to see Iniesta shimmy and glide to this.\" If that's not inviting an Aldi-cheap gag, then I don't know what is: here's one for David Luiz. Does anyone need a flatmate? Don't worry, it's not Tom Lutz. A friend of a friend is working in London for six months and needs somewhere near or with decent transport links to Canary Wharf. I've never met him but I completely vouch for, er, his mate. If you know of anywhere that might be available from mid-April, send me an email and I'll forward it on to him. NB: guardian.co.uk is not legally responsible should he turn out to be a malodorous deviant with a liking for Creme de Menthe breakfasts and raw Crispy Pancakes. 1 min United kick off from left to right. They're in red; Spurs are in white. 2 min \"Surely it's every close up of Giggs that should be accompanied by the Benny Hill theme tune,\" says Rolf Mellander. \"Surely.\" 3 min Modric is playing from the left, as we expected. Spurs haven't really seen the ball yet, with United moving it around confidently. Assou-Ekotto and Jones were down for a few seconds after a tangle of legs, but they seem fine now. 4 min There's a breezy, open feel to the game at the moment. United in particular have looked sharp in possession. 5 min Saha drags a tame shot straight at De Gea from 15 yards. 6 min Welbeck falsenines his way into the space to receive a pass from Scholes. He turns, runs at and then past Kaboul before thrashing a shot high and wide from 20 yards. Moments later, Adebayor does almost the same thing at the other end, dropping deep to receive and driving over the bar from 20 yards. 8 min Sandro goes through Scholes from the side, a tackle for which some referees would have produced a yellow card. 9 min Nani's pass from the right wing is swept first-time towards goal by Rooney on the edge of the box, but it's straight at Friedel. He throws it straight to Lennon, who makes a piercing diagonal at the heart of the United defence before he is stopped by Evans on the edge of the box. That was a vital challenge. 10 min \"Is that a different colour ball they're using today?\" says Simon Drake. Yep, it's white. They'd been using yellow till this weekend. 12 min A bit of a lull, with Tottenham having a fair bit of the ball in their own half. 14 min So far this match has been a bit of a tease. Lots of nice passing; lots of flirting, fluttering of eyelashes and running of fingers through hair. But nothing more than that. 15 min Lennon, who has often given Evra agita down the years, looks sharp. 17 min After a good start from United, Spurs are now the dominant side, even if all of their play has been in front of the United defence. 18 min I'm still not convinced this was over the line, you know. I'd like to see it from another angle. 19 min De Gea makes a good save to deny Adebayor. It started with a poor kick from De Gea thaat Sandro headed forward to Adebayor. He ran at Evans, into the area, and then opened his body out to pass the ball low towards the far corner. De Gea got down to this left to push it away. 20 min As is often the case in big games away from home, United look a bit like a team waiting to concede. There is very little purpose or urgency in their passing, and Spurs are well on top now. 22 min Lennon roasts Evra down the right and drives in a low cross that ricochets around the box dangerously for a couple of seconds before it is booted clear. 25 min \"Can we assume from the white ball that winter and the possibility of snow is now over?\" says Richard Harris. \"It will save an awful lot of time wasted tramping round the countryside looking for daffodils and skylarks if the Premier League can decide when spring has arrived.\" 27 min Nani beats Assou-Ekotto with a lovely bodyswerve, but \u2013 and stop me if you think etcetera \u2013 his cross is poor. 28 min Jones is booked after bundling Saha over on the edge of the box. The free-kick is a fair way to the left of centre. It's set up for Kaboul, whose blast was going wide but was deflected for a corner by Welbeck in the wall. 29 min The corner is half cleared, and when Modric puts it back into the area Rooney dives in front of De Gea to head clear. 31 min I suppose you could use the phrase \"sterile domination\" to describe Spurs' first-half performance, but they have been much the better team. 32 min \"Are you and Jacob Steinberg an item?\" says Arsene Hanciyan. Yes. And? 33 min United haven't managed to get Rooney in the game, while Sandro and Livermore have done well against Scholes and Carrick. 34 min Saha snakes away from Carrick and Scholes, eventually moving the ball to Lennon on the right. His chipped cross is nutted clear by Ferdinand. 35 min We thought one of these teams would miss their bionic winger \u2013 and it's true, United aren't the same team without Antonio Valencia. 36 min A dangerous low cross from Jones \u2013 he is a superb crosser of the ball \u2013 is put behind for a corner by Ledley King. Young drives it low towards the near post, where Rooney gets a run on his marker and flicks the ball straight at Friedel. White Hart Lane has seen that corner routine a million times before with Anderton and Sheringham. 37 min Adebayor has a goal disallowed for handball. The excellent Lennon roasted Jones down the left and passed the ball along the face of the six-yard box. De Gea palmed it out and it came to Saha, who knocked the loose ball straight towards goal from eight yards. His shot hit Adebayor \u2013 who was almost on the goalline \u2013 on the chest and then the arm, after which he helped it into the net. Spurs are seriously aggrieved but he certainly handled it. 40 min \"During an interview with Defoe on the radio today,\" begins Marek Miernik, \"the somewhat alarming fact surfaced that thanks to yoga Brad Friedel can do the splits.\" 41 min Somewhere in the bowels of White Hart Lane, a hairdryer is being connected to a plug socket. United have been poor. 44 min Sandro is booked, as much for repeat offending as anything I suspect, after a foul on Ashley Young. The Spurs fans are booing at the referee, but he's got almost everything right in this half. Why the hell would you want to be a referee? They get even more abuse than Guardian sport writers! GOAL! Spurs 0-1 Manchester United (Rooney 45) Smash/grab. United take the lead in the last minute of the first half. Young booms over a really good inswinging corner from the left, and Rooney gets away from Walker to head down and into the net from six yards. It's hard to know what's more shocking: the defending of Walker, who Rooney was able to lose far too easily, or the fact United have actually scored a real goal from a set piece. 45+1 min \"Poor eh?\" says Lawrence McGinty of my comment in the 41st minute, as if a goal somehow erases what has gone before. Half time: Spurs 0-1 Manchester United The half-time whistle prompts boos from the crowd and complaints from Ledley King to the referee. They are right to be aggrieved about the scoreline, but not necessarily the refereeing. The Adebayor handball I'm still not sure whether it was deliberate or not. The strange thing is that, although the laws make no distinction between penalising attackers and defenders for handball, they are generally judged differently. Defenders are usually only punished for deliberate handball, certainly in their own area, whereas attackers are generally punished for any type of handball. That's probably a subconscious distinction between the severity of the punishment, which has then been reinforced by decades of precedent. The difference today is that the punishment for Spurs was as severe \u2013 even more severe, in fact \u2013 than a penalty against them. So maybe it wasn't the right decision after all. That said, Adebayor may have done it deliberately; I only saw a couple of replays. On Sky, Graeme Souness and Gary Neville think the Spurs goal should have been given, because Adebayor could not get his hand out of the way. It certainly wasn't deliberate \u2013 Adebayor was backing away, trying to avoid the ball, when it hit his outstretched left hand. By the laws of the game I think it's a goal, although I suspect nine out of ten referee cats would have made the same decision as Martin Atkinson. 46 min Spurs kick off the second half. They just need to do what they did in the first half, with a bit of added netbothering. 47 min Gary Neville said at half-time that Phil Jones might be replaced by Rafael as he is on a yellow card and struggling. Neville knows the perils of being a right-back on a yellow card at White Hart Lane. At this stage of his career Jones isn't actually very good at defending, is he? I thought Rafael would start, as he's a better defender and has done well against Bale in the past. 48 min \"I've never understood the problems people have with handball,\" says Brad McMillian. \"For me, it should be simple. If a player gains an advantage by using his hand, it's a foul, and a free-kick. Accidents happen, so it shouldn't be a booking unless it was deliberate. The 'ball to hand' defence is nonsense, Adebayor gained an advantage, and whether he intended to or not is irrelevant (I think it was accidental, so not a booking.)\" There's a certain logic in that, but if you apply it to defenders in their own penalty area you would have two or three penalties per match. 52 min An outstanding save from David de Gea keeps United ahead. Livermore's low 20-yard shot took a deflection off Saha and De Gea, who would have seen the original shot late because of a crowd of bodies, dived low to his right to get a strong wrist on the ball and keep it out. De Gea e is far from the best goalkeeper in the league, but his reflexes are as good as anyone's in the league. That save reminded me of one Tim Howard made at Rangers in 2003, if you remember the game: superb reactions and a really strong wrist. 54 min \"I'm supposed to dislike Man U (as a Liverpool fan and ABU) but like Gene Hackman with Danny Glover in the Royal Tenenbaums it's impossible not to respect them,\" says Niall Mullen. \"They are, to paraphrase that movie, everything Liverpool are not. They just know how to win. Damn them!\" But have you ever talked some jive to them? 55 min Some people are of the opinion that Manchester United's Vidic-less defence can be bullied physically, and Adebayor has done that at times today. 57 min Lennon plays a nice one-two with Adebayor and blasts in a cross that is cleared for a corner. Spurs are all over United, and moments later Evra is penalised for a clumsy foul on Modric 25 yards from goal. The free-kick is to the left of centre, so you would expect Assou-Ekotto to take it. 58 min Assou-Ekotto does take it, curving a good effort that just shaved the top of the bar. De Gea did have it covered, however, and took his hands away at the last minute. 59 min Adebayor falls over in the box after a challenge from Ferdinand, who tells Adebayor to get up and is told to eff off in return. I think it was the right decision by Martin Atkinson. United desperately need some respite, though; at the moment they can't keep the ball for more than three or four passes. GOAL! Tottenham 0-2 Manchester United (Young 60) This is a scandalous scoreline. Absolutely scandalous. Modric went to sleep when United got a throw in down the right. Nani ran off him to receive the throw in the area and guide the ball across the face of goal. It was half cleared from under his own bar by Walker, but Young, on the left side of the six-yard box, contorted his body splendidly to scissor-volley the loose ball past a phalanx of players on the line and into the far corner. That's a very good finish. 61 min Ryan Giggs replaces Paul Scholes, who found the pace a bit too much today. 62 min More exhilarating wingplay from Lennon. He beats Evra with ease and chips a ball beyond the far post, where Assou-Ekotto, 15 yards from goal, screws a volley back whence it came. 63 min \"There may well be logic in Brad McMillan's handball reasoning (48 min), but it's not what it says in the laws,\" says Roy Allen. \"f he wants to invent his own sport with his own laws then, fine. But if he's interested in football, he has to stick to the laws which state that handball has to be deliberate or it isn't handball.\" 64 min Spurs could have sulked at the injustice of it all, but they have simply picked up where they left off before the second goal. What a strange game. 65 min Since you didn't ask, yes we have done a Joy of Six on smash-and-grab victories. The Inter/Sampdoria match remains the most dramatic I've ever seen, and you really should set aside 10 minutes to watch the highlights later today. 66 min Assou-Ekotto hits a well controlled volley from 30 yards but it's straight at De Gea. 68 min \"There's something very peculiar going on here,\" says Chris Kempshall. \"I thought the support of 'Arry for England manager was based on an expectation that he might bring his club form into the job. Instead he seems to be slowly turning Spurs into England with each passing week.\" England don't play this well when they win, never mind when they lose. GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 0-3 Manchester United (Young 69) Ashley Young scores a glorious goal. Evra found him in a bit too much space, 25 yards from goal; Young moved the ball infield, used the advancing Kaboul as a screen and set a quite majestic curler into the far top corner. Friedel had no chance. It was very similar to his first goal against Arsenal in the 8-2 last August. Young has scored four brilliant goals against north London's finest this season. Some would say he's done bugger all else, but we'll leave that for another day. 70 min Now, finally, Spurs do go into a little sulk, with United able to play keepball for a couple of minutes. You can't blame Spurs. They have been much the better side and they are 3-0 down. 72 min Spurs are only four points ahead of Arsenal, you know. Surely the worst Arsenal side for 15 years couldn't finish above the best Spurs side for 25 years. Could they? 73 min \"Harry for England\" chant the United supporters. 74 min I would advise you not to make any plans for the evening of Monday 30 April. I know modern football is tediously overhyped, but it's probably fair to assume that it will be the biggest Manchester derby of them all. 75 min Spurs have now stopped sulking and are playing some decent stuff again, although it lacks some of the conviction of their earlier work. Modric's free kick from the left is punched away unconvincingly by De Gea and blootered clear by Jones. 76 min \"Looks like 'Arry's team are falling apart two thirds of the way through a tournament,\" says Gary Naylor. \"He really does have his name of the England job doesn't he?\" 77 min \"I'm not sure you can call this a scandalous scoreline, Rob,\" says Sean Moore. \"Sure, Tottenham were the better team in the first half and had most of the possession, but what did they do with it? De Gea only had a couple of real saves to make. United have defended well, and been patient. It's paying off in spades right now... I also don't agree that DeGea is \"far\" from being the best goalkeeper in the league - he's been superb since Lindegaard's injury, and is absolutely one of the best keepers in the league.\" I'd say he's far too weak on set pieces to be regarded as one of the best at this stage, but it's been obvious from the first month that he has the capacity to become a true great. His potential is insane. As for the game, hmmm, I don't know if I agree. You say United were patient, but their ball-retention was hopeless from the 10th minute to Young's third goal. 79 min Ji-sung Park replaces Nani for Manchester United, while Spurs bring on Jermain Defoe and Nico Kranjcar for Louis Saha and Sandro. 80 min \"Has John Terry ruined Spurs' season?\" says Chuck Schick. \"He allegedly said some pretty nasty stuff. The FA said he couldn't be England captain until after the court case. Capello said 'that's my job, screw your stupid blazer'. Redknapp became the first choice for the job and hasn't done a great deal to damp the speculation. This is all Terry's fault, isn't it?\" Everything is, isn't it? 81 min I should have said earlier that we are having problems with the auto-refresh tool, so if the descriptions of the goals have not appeared, just press F5. 82 min Nothing is happening. Both teams would be happy to call time on the game now. 83 min Spurs make their last substitution, with Danny Rose coming on for the superb Aaron Lennon. GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-3 Manchester United (Defoe 87) Spurs get a consolation goal. A poor pass from Giggs went to Defoe, who ran to within 25 yards of goal and swooshed it past the unsighted De Gea. 88 min Evans is booked for a foul on someone or other. 89 min \"Whenever I hear Stereolab's 'French Disko' I like picture Vieira &amp; Petit owning Premiership midfielders,\" says Matt Keeler. \"Rugged and fluid. If only 99% of YouTube football clips compilers had decent music taste eh?\" What do you mean? 90 min Everton did score twice in injury time to draw 3-3 against United last season, though it's hard to see it happening here. There are three minutes of added time. 90+1 min \"Who,\" says Michael Ryan, \"is the best goalie in the league in your opinion?\" Joe Hart, although I think De Gea and Gomes have the best reflexes. Full time: Tottenham Hotspur 1-3 Manchester United This is a huge result for Manchester United. They were outplayed for much of the game \u2013 Spurs had 14 shots to United's six and 57 per cent of the possession \u2013 but they defended well and two brilliant goals from Ashley Young ended the game after 69 minutes. United are now two points behind Manchester City, with an easier run-in. It's shaping up to be one of the better title races of the Premier League era. Thanks for your emails; night.",

That was a vital challenge.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>10 min</strong> \"Is that a different colour ball they're using today?\" says Simon Drake. Yep, it's white. They'd been using yellow till this weekend.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12 min</strong> A bit of a lull, with Tottenham having a fair bit of the ball in their own half.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> So far this match has been a bit of a tease. Lots of nice passing; lots of flirting, fluttering of eyelashes and running of fingers through hair. But nothing more than that.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>15 min</strong> Lennon, who has often given Evra <em>agita</em> down the years, looks sharp.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> After a good start from United, Spurs are now the dominant side, even if all of their play has been in front of the United defence.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>18 min</strong> I'm still not convinced <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-8dOjeVC80\">this was over the line</a>, you know. I'd like to see it from another angle.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>19 min</strong> De Gea makes a good save to deny Adebayor. It started with a poor kick from De Gea thaat Sandro headed forward to Adebayor. He ran at Evans, into the area, and then opened his body out to pass the ball low towards the far corner. De Gea got down to this left to push it away.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> As is often the case in big games away from home, United look a bit like a team waiting to concede. There is very little purpose or urgency in their passing, and Spurs are well on top now.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>22 min </strong> Lennon roasts Evra down the right and drives in a low cross that ricochets around the box dangerously for a couple of seconds before it is booted clear.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> \"Can we assume from the white ball that winter and the possibility of snow is now over?\" says Richard Harris. \"It will save an awful lot of time wasted tramping round the countryside looking for daffodils and skylarks if the Premier League can decide when spring has arrived.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>27 min</strong> Nani beats Assou-Ekotto with a lovely bodyswerve, but \u2013 and stop me if you think etcetera \u2013 his cross is poor.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> Jones is booked after bundling Saha over on the edge of the box. The free-kick is a fair way to the left of centre. It's set up for Kaboul, whose blast was going wide but was deflected for a corner by Welbeck in the wall.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> The corner is half cleared, and when Modric puts it back into the area Rooney dives in front of De Gea to head clear.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> I suppose you could use the phrase \"sterile domination\" to describe Spurs' first-half performance, but they have been much the better team.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>32 min</strong> \"Are you and Jacob Steinberg an item?\" says Arsene Hanciyan. Yes. And?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> United haven't managed to get Rooney in the game, while Sandro and Livermore have done well against Scholes and Carrick.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>34 min</strong> Saha snakes away from Carrick and Scholes, eventually moving the ball to Lennon on the right. His chipped cross is nutted clear by Ferdinand.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> We thought one of these teams would miss their bionic winger \u2013 and it's true, United aren't the same team without Antonio Valencia.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> A dangerous low cross from Jones \u2013 he is a superb crosser of the ball \u2013 is put behind for a corner by Ledley King. Young drives it low towards the near post, where Rooney gets a run on his marker and flicks the ball straight at Friedel. White Hart Lane has seen that corner routine a million times before with Anderton and Sheringham.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>37 min</strong> Adebayor has a goal disallowed for handball. The excellent Lennon roasted Jones down the left and passed the ball along the face of the six-yard box. De Gea palmed it out and it came to Saha, who knocked the loose ball straight towards goal from eight yards. His shot hit Adebayor&#xa0;\u2013 who was almost on the goalline \u2013 on the chest and then the arm, after which he helped it into the net. Spurs are seriously aggrieved but he certainly handled it.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>40 min</strong> \"During an interview with Defoe on the radio today,\" begins Marek Miernik, \"the somewhat alarming fact surfaced that thanks to yoga Brad Friedel can do the splits.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> Somewhere in the bowels of White Hart Lane, a hairdryer is being connected to a plug socket. United have been poor.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Sandro is booked, as much for repeat offending as anything I suspect, after a foul on Ashley Young. The Spurs fans are booing at the referee, but he's got almost everything right in this half. Why the hell would you want to be a referee? They get even more abuse than Guardian sport writers!</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spurs 0-1 Manchester United (Rooney 45)</strong> Smash/grab. United take the lead in the last minute of the first half. Young booms over a really good inswinging corner from the left, and Rooney gets away from Walker to head down and into the net from six yards. It's hard to know what's more shocking: the defending of Walker, who Rooney was able to lose far too easily, or the fact United have actually scored a real goal from a set piece.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>45+1 min</strong> \"Poor eh?\" says Lawrence McGinty of my comment in the 41st minute, as if a goal somehow erases what has gone before.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Half time: Spurs 0-1 Manchester United</strong> The half-time whistle prompts boos from the crowd and complaints from Ledley King to the referee. They are right to be aggrieved about the scoreline, but not necessarily the refereeing.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>The Adebayor handball</strong> I'm still not sure whether it was deliberate or not. The strange thing is that, although the laws make no distinction between penalising attackers and defenders for handball, they are generally judged differently. Defenders are usually only punished for deliberate handball, certainly in their own area, whereas attackers are generally punished for any type of handball. That's probably a subconscious distinction between the severity of the punishment, which has then been reinforced by decades of precedent. The difference today is that the punishment for Spurs was as severe \u2013 even more severe, in fact \u2013 than a penalty against them. So maybe it wasn't the right decision after all. That said, Adebayor may have done it deliberately; I only saw a couple of replays.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>On Sky</strong>, Graeme Souness and Gary Neville think the Spurs goal should have been given, because Adebayor could not get his hand out of the way. It certainly wasn't deliberate \u2013 Adebayor was backing away, trying to avoid the ball, when it hit his outstretched left hand. By the laws of the game I think it's a goal, although I suspect nine out of ten referee cats would have made the same decision as Martin Atkinson.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Spurs kick off the second half. They just need to do what they did in the first half, with a bit of added netbothering.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> Gary Neville said at half-time that Phil Jones might be replaced by Rafael as he is on a yellow card and struggling. Neville knows the perils of being <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYQCHgOpbrg#t=58m07s\">a right-back on a yellow card at White Hart Lane</a>. At this stage of his career Jones isn't actually very good at defending, is he? I thought Rafael would start, as he's a better defender and has done well against Bale in the past.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> \"I've never understood the problems people have with handball,\" says Brad McMillian. \"For me, it should be simple. If a player gains an advantage by using his hand, it's a foul, and a free-kick. Accidents happen, so it shouldn't be a booking unless it was deliberate. The 'ball to hand' defence is nonsense, Adebayor gained an advantage, and whether he intended to or not is irrelevant (I think it was accidental, so not a booking.)\" There's a certain logic in that, but if you apply it to defenders in their own penalty area you would have two or three penalties per match.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> An outstanding save from David de Gea keeps United ahead. Livermore's low 20-yard shot took a deflection off Saha and De Gea, who would have seen the original shot late because of a crowd of bodies, dived low to his right to get a strong wrist on the ball and keep it out. De Gea e is far from the best goalkeeper in the league, but his reflexes are as good as anyone's in the league. That save reminded me of one Tim Howard made at Rangers in 2003, if you remember the game: superb reactions and a really strong wrist.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> \"I'm supposed to dislike Man U (as a Liverpool fan and ABU) but like Gene Hackman with Danny Glover in the Royal Tenenbaums it's impossible not to respect them,\" says Niall Mullen. \"They are, to paraphrase that movie, everything Liverpool are not. They just know how to win. Damn them!\" But <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zGQrybWi0\">have you ever talked some jive</a> to them?</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>55 min</strong> Some people are of the opinion that Manchester United's Vidic-less defence can be bullied physically, and Adebayor has done that at times today.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Lennon plays a nice one-two with Adebayor and blasts in a cross that is cleared for a corner. Spurs are all over United, and moments later Evra is penalised for a clumsy foul on Modric 25 yards from goal. The free-kick is to the left of centre, so you would expect Assou-Ekotto to take it.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>58 min</strong> Assou-Ekotto does take it, curving a good effort that just shaved the top of the bar. De Gea did have it covered, however, and took his hands away at the last minute.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Adebayor falls over in the box after a challenge from Ferdinand, who tells Adebayor to get up and is told to eff off in return. I think it was the right decision by Martin Atkinson. United desperately need some respite, though; at the moment they can't keep the ball for more than three or four passes.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Tottenham 0-2 Manchester United (Young 60)</strong> This is a scandalous scoreline. Absolutely scandalous. Modric went to sleep when United got a throw in down the right. Nani ran off him to receive the throw in the area and guide the ball across the face of goal. It was half cleared from under his own bar by Walker, but Young, on the left side of the six-yard box, contorted his body splendidly to scissor-volley the loose ball past a phalanx of players on the line and into the far corner. That's a very good finish.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>61 min</strong> Ryan Giggs replaces Paul Scholes, who found the pace a bit too much today.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> More exhilarating wingplay from Lennon. He beats Evra with ease and chips a ball beyond the far post, where Assou-Ekotto, 15 yards from goal, screws a volley back whence it came.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>63 min</strong> \"There may well be logic in Brad McMillan's handball reasoning (48 min), but it's not what it says in the laws,\" says Roy Allen. \"f he wants to invent his own sport with his own laws then, fine. But if he's interested in football, he has to stick to the laws which state that handball has to be deliberate or it isn't handball.\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>64 min</strong> Spurs could have sulked at the injustice of it all, but they have simply picked up where they left off before the second goal. What a strange game.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Since you didn't ask, yes we have done a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2009/nov/13/1\">Joy of Six on smash-and-grab victories</a>. The Inter/Sampdoria match remains the most dramatic I've ever seen, and you really should set aside 10 minutes to watch the highlights later today.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Assou-Ekotto hits a well controlled volley from 30 yards but it's straight at De Gea.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> \"There's something very peculiar going on here,\" says Chris Kempshall. \"I thought the support of 'Arry for England manager was based on an expectation that he might bring his club form into the job. Instead he seems to be slowly turning Spurs into England with each passing week.\" England don't play this well when they <em>win</em>, never mind when they lose.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 0-3 Manchester United (Young 69)</strong> Ashley Young scores a glorious goal. Evra found him in a bit too much space, 25 yards from goal; Young moved the ball infield, used the advancing Kaboul as a screen and set a quite majestic curler into the far top corner. Friedel had no chance. It was very similar to his first goal against Arsenal in the 8-2 last August. Young has scored four brilliant goals against north London's finest this season. Some would say he's done bugger all else, but we'll leave that for another day.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> Now, finally, Spurs do go into a little sulk, with United able to play keepball for a couple of minutes. You can't blame Spurs. They have been much the better side and they are 3-0 down.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>72 min</strong> Spurs are only four points ahead of Arsenal, you know. Surely the worst Arsenal side for 15 years couldn't finish above the best Spurs side for 25 years. Could they?</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> \"Harry for England\" chant the United supporters.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> I would advise you not to make any plans for the evening of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/fixtures\">Monday 30 April</a>. I know modern football is tediously overhyped, but it's probably fair to assume that it will be the biggest Manchester derby of them all.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> Spurs have now stopped sulking and are playing some decent stuff again, although it lacks some of the conviction of their earlier work. Modric's free kick from the left is punched away unconvincingly by De Gea and blootered clear by Jones.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>76 min</strong> \"Looks like 'Arry's team are falling apart two thirds of the way through a tournament,\" says Gary Naylor. \"He really does have his name of the England job doesn't he?\"</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> \"I'm not sure you can call this a scandalous scoreline, Rob,\" says Sean Moore. \"Sure, Tottenham were the better team in the first half and had most of the possession, but what did they do with it? De Gea only had a couple of real saves to make. United have defended well, and been patient. It's paying off in spades right now... I also don't agree that DeGea is \"far\" from being the best goalkeeper in the league - he's been superb since Lindegaard's injury, and is absolutely one of the best keepers in the league.\" I'd say he's far too weak on set pieces to be regarded as one of the best at this stage, but it's been obvious from the first month that he has the capacity to become a true great. His potential is insane. As for the game, hmmm, I don't know if I agree. You say United were patient, but their ball-retention was hopeless from the 10th minute to Young's third goal.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> Ji-sung Park replaces Nani for Manchester United, while Spurs bring on Jermain Defoe and Nico Kranjcar for Louis Saha and Sandro.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> \"Has John Terry ruined Spurs' season?\" says Chuck Schick. \"He allegedly said some pretty nasty stuff. The FA said he couldn't be England captain until after the court case. Capello said 'that's my job, screw your stupid blazer'. Redknapp became the first choice for the job and hasn't done a great deal to damp the speculation. This is all Terry's fault, isn't it?\" Everything is, isn't it?</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>81 min</strong> I should have said earlier that we are having problems with the auto-refresh tool, so if the descriptions of the goals have not appeared, just press F5.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>82 min</strong> Nothing is happening. Both teams would be happy to call time on the game now.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Spurs make their last substitution, with Danny Rose coming on for the superb Aaron Lennon.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-3 Manchester United (Defoe 87)</strong> Spurs get a consolation goal. A poor pass from Giggs went to Defoe, who ran to within 25 yards of goal and swooshed it past the unsighted De Gea.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> Evans is booked for a foul on someone or other.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> \"Whenever I hear <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kB9LRZ0sAs\">Stereolab's 'French Disko'</a> I like picture Vieira &amp; Petit owning Premiership midfielders,\" says Matt Keeler. \"Rugged and fluid. If only 99% of YouTube football clips compilers had decent music taste eh?\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjOo4rj66c\">What do you mean</a>?</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> Everton did score twice in injury time to draw 3-3 against United last season, though it's hard to see it happening here. There are three minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>90+1 min</strong> \"Who,\" says Michael Ryan, \"is the best goalie in the league in your opinion?\" Joe Hart, although I think De Gea and Gomes have the best reflexes.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>Full time: Tottenham Hotspur 1-3 Manchester United</strong> This is a huge result for Manchester United. They were outplayed for much of the game&#xa0;\u2013 Spurs had 14 shots to United's six and 57 per cent of the possession \u2013 but they defended well and two brilliant goals from Ashley Young ended the game after 69 minutes. United are now two points behind Manchester City, with an easier run-in. It's shaping up to be one of the better title races of the Premier League era. Thanks for your emails; night.</p>",

Meeting Welsh actor Joanna Page at a Downing Street reception to mark St David's Day, David Cameron revealed himself as a \"huge fan\" of Gavin and Stacey, lamenting that \"like all sitcoms in the United Kingdom, it was much too short. We need more episodes.\" Under a more Stalinist political system, James Corden and Ruth Jones, the show's writers, would be diverted from their respective roles in One Man, Two Guvnors on Broadway and Stella on Sky One and locked in an office at the Ministry of Culture until they delivered series four. Still, even if his request is unlikely to produce results, Cameron has touched on a tension in British TV between supply and demand. A comparison between the volume of UK and US comedy hits, for example, produces scores that would make a sports announcer's voice rise in sharp surprise: Fawlty Towers 12 \u2013 Friends 236; Frasier 264 \u2013 The Office 14. The US version of The Office ran to 169 episodes. Are these figures an automatic defeat for British TV? If the PM were to hold one of the Number 10 summits to which he has recently become prone, he would discover that the transatlantic contrast stems from a difference in economic and artistic mentalities. The American plenty has traditionally been driven by the fact that the big rewards lie in syndication (the sale of episodes to repeat channels); 100 used to be the minimum volume that can be traded in this way. But \u2013 and Cameron has instinctively landed on the right-wing side of this argument \u2013 it is also significant that US TV has a fundamentally capitalist attitude to this gamble, while the UK, having risen around the publicly funded BBC, is more cautious and regulated. Networks in the US regularly write off huge sums of money by cancelling a show during its opening season; here, the failure of a high-profile launch brings headlines implying crisis at the network. The biggest gulf in thinking, however, is literary. Having grown out of theatre, British TV fiction retains a reverence for the vision of the single writer or, in comedy, a pair of writers. But US TV is a child of Hollywood, where it's standard for a script to go through numerous hands. British hits tend to come from a couple of people in a spare bedroom, US successes from a dozen or so in a writers' room. A moderately TV-literate UK viewer knows that John Cleese and Connie Booth wrote all of Fawlty Towers \u2013 but you'd need to be a serious buff to know who scripted your favourite episodes of Friends. Could so-called table-writing have created 236 episodes of Fawlty Towers or Gavin and Stacey? It's possible, but the overall quality and distinctiveness would have inevitably dropped. The standing ovation jamboree Apart from the quality of the staging and singing in ENO's production of John Adams's The Death of Klinghoffer, I was struck by how lavishly rehearsed the curtain call seemed to be. Even the child performers essayed deep bows, like fervent monarchists meeting the Queen. In my experience, the climactic clapping is becoming an ever more important part of performance. In the 1970s and 80s, there was a political reaction against the practice, with some companies not coming out at all or standing in a non-hierarchical line and curtly nodding at the audience. Nowadays, productions seem to have given as much thought to the curtain call as to the show. Actors will often do a bit of business in character; in the musical Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, some of the cast don new costumes just to come out and take their bow. Audiences, in turn, have upped their own performance: standing ovations now seem to happen most nights, as in New York. These jamborees of mutual congratulation are surely another consequence of the recession. Tickets are such a luxury in a credit crunch that enjoyment has become ostentatious: we show how pleased we are to have come, and the actors that they are glad we did.",

It's possible, but the overall quality and distinctiveness would have inevitably dropped.</p> <p><strong>The standing ovation jamboree</strong></p> <p>Apart from the quality of the staging and singing in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/26/death-of-klinghoffer-review\" title=\"\">ENO's production of John Adams's The Death of Klinghoffer</a>, I was struck by how lavishly rehearsed the curtain call seemed to be. Even the child performers essayed deep bows, like fervent monarchists meeting the Queen.</p> <p>In my experience, the climactic clapping is becoming an ever more important part of performance. In the 1970s and 80s, there was a political reaction against the practice, with some companies not coming out at all or standing in a non-hierarchical line and curtly nodding at the audience. Nowadays, productions seem to have given as much thought to the curtain call as to the show. Actors will often do a bit of business in character; in the musical <a href=\"http://www.priscillathemusical.com/\" title=\"\">Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</a>, some of the cast don new costumes just to come out and take their bow.</p> <p>Audiences, in turn, have upped their own performance: standing ovations now seem to happen most nights, as in New York. These jamborees of mutual congratulation are surely another consequence of the recession. Tickets are such a luxury in a credit crunch that enjoyment has become ostentatious: we show how pleased we&#xa0;are to have come, and the actors that they are glad we did.</p>",

Die Meistersinger arrived in January, courtesy of the Royal Opera; a Mariinsky Parsifal is due next month, with Opera North's Walk\u00fcre following in June, but the most intriguing of the quartet was always going to be this locally sourced Tristan und Isolde, with Andris Nelsons conducting the City of Birmingham Symphony. Two years ago, Nelsons conducted a memorable Lohengrin in Symphony Hall, just before he made his Bayreuth debut with the same work. This was his first Tristan, though no one would have guessed it. The familiar Nelsons trademarks \u2013 irresistible surges and sweeps, luminous orchestral details, instinctive grasp of dramatic structure from the smallest to the largest scale \u2013 were all in evidence, without ever becoming an end in themselves, and the CBSO, it almost goes without saying, played wonderfully for him. One of the highlights of Nelsons' Lohengrin had been Lioba Braun's Ortrud, and she was the star of this performance too, not in the role of Brangaene, in which first made her name in the 1990s, but as Isolde. Feisty and fierce in the first act, meltingly tender in the second, she sang the final act's Liebestod with mesmerising, rapt containment. The Tristan was Stephen Gould , who made up in stamina and power what he lacked in refinement, but plausibly scaled down his sound for the love duet. Christianne Stotijn's Brangaene was a little colourless, and too often wordless also, Matthew Best's King Marke was a model of sad dignity. Brett Polegato's Kurwenal was a real treat, too, his robust diatonic music always a breath of fresh air after the swooning chromaticism of the lovers.",

There are weirder fringe attractions, too: chess grandmasters; a mycologist lecturing on fungi; two women in orange wigs playing clapping games. Most of the time, the venue is a sonic Babel, with your brain trying to process two or more separate pieces of music at once.

      "bodyText": "The boxer Dave Charnley, who has died of lung cancer aged 76, was an outstanding British lightweight champion. He also held the European and British Empire titles, and was widely regarded as possibly the best British boxer never to have won a world title. In April 1961, he narrowly lost on points over 15 rounds against the American world lightweight champion Joe \"Old Bones\" Brown, in front of a then British record indoor crowd of 18,000 at Earls Court, in London. Charnley was too much of a gentleman to publicly rail against this misfortune, but he always believed that he had done enough to have been awarded victory. It was the second time that Charnley, nicknamed \"the Dartford Destroyer\", had challenged Brown for the title; he was stopped because of a cut over his right eye after five rounds in the US two years earlier. He fought Brown for a third time, in a non-title contest at Belle Vue, Manchester, in 1963, knocking out his old rival in six rounds, but Charnley would never fight again for a world title. He retired in 1964, after stepping up a division to face the formidable world welterweight champion Emile Griffith in another non-title fight at the Empire Pool, Wembley, only to suffer three knockdowns and a bad beating on his way to a ninth-round stoppage loss. Charnley was born in Dartford, Kent, where his Scottish parents had relocated from Motherwell. He showed an early aptitude for boxing, joined the Dartford amateur boxing club and moved to the renowned Fitzroy Lodge club in London, where he developed his southpaw skills sufficiently to win the 1954 ABA featherweight title. He took the bronze medal at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver in 1954. Before becoming a full-time professional, Charnley had worked as a boilermaker for the Vickers engineering firm, in Crayford, Kent. After joining boxing's paid ranks at the end of 1954, aged only 19, it was soon clear that his sharp punching style would make him popular with the leading promoters. He beat Joe Lucy on points to win the British lightweight title at the Harringay Arena in London in 1957, and continued to hold that title until his retirement seven years later; he won a Lonsdale Belt outright with his second defence, against Maurice Cullen in Manchester in 1963. After beating Lucy, Charnley quickly proved he could operate at the world level. He lost a challenge on points for the Empire title, held by Willie Toweel, but in a return match with him at Wembley in 1959, he won by a 10th-round knockout. A year later, Charnley stopped Mario Vecchiatto, again at Wembley, to win the European title. By this time, he was earning handsomely; he was sensible enough to save and later invest the money from his ring career, enabling him to become a wealthy businessman. Before he quit boxing, he had already launched a successful hair salon. He estimated his ring earnings to have been in excess of \u00a3400,000, a considerable sum at the time, and he soon moved into the property business. He bought land and built estates in the Dartford area then established the offices of his company in Regent Street, where the business expanded through restorations of hotels and other projects. Charnley's biographer, James Kirkwood, said: \"It may be a cliche, but it really was true of Dave that you never heard anybody say a bad word about him.\" His first marriage, to Ruth, was dissolved. He is survived by his second wife, Maureen, and by their two daughters, Lisa and Joanna. \u2022 Dave Charnley, boxer, born 10 October 1935; died 3 March 2012",

By this time, he was earning handsomely; he was sensible enough to save and later invest the money from his ring career, enabling him to become a wealthy businessman. Before he quit boxing, he had already launched a successful hair salon.</p> <p>He estimated his ring earnings to have been in excess of \u00a3400,000, a considerable sum at the time, and he soon moved into the property business. He bought land and built estates in the Dartford area then established the offices of his company in Regent Street, where the business expanded through restorations of hotels and other projects.</p> <p>Charnley's biographer, James Kirkwood, said: \"It may be a cliche, but it really was true of Dave that you never heard anybody say a bad word about him.\"</p> <p>His first marriage, to Ruth, was dissolved. He is survived by his second wife, Maureen, and by their two daughters, Lisa and Joanna.</p> <p><em> </em>\u2022 Dave Charnley, boxer, born 10 October 1935; died 3 March 2012</p>",

      "bodyText": "For more than 20 years, Wendy Duggan, who has died aged 84, provided and supervised all the animals on the BBC programme Play School. In so doing, she played a telling if inconspicuous part in the life of children throughout the nation. Every Wednesday, she was key to the success of Pets Day, when animals such as rabbits, chimps, puppies, donkeys and, most notably, her cockatoo Katoo, entertained and enthralled the young audience. Sometimes she and her husband, Ron, would take Katoo and some of the smaller animals to the studio on the bus from their home in Putney, south-west London. There were caged birds in every room, at one time as many as 150, each lovingly cared for and each with its own story. Duggan was regarded by her colleagues as embodying the soul of Play School; she was caring and gentle yet possessed the confidence of expertise. Quietly eccentric, and with an aristocratic bearing, she was also a very private person who had extraordinary social connections yet was always a model of discretion. She was born in London. Her father, Hugh Jones, was an architect, and her mother, June Dobson, was a socialite descended from the 17th-century painter William Dobson. After attending the Royal Hospital school in Suffolk, Wendy studied photography under Cecil Beaton. This introduced her to a world of celebrities and royals \u2013 she attended the wedding of Antony Armstrong-Jones (later Lord Snowdon) to Princess Margaret. Yet her true love was working with animals and particularly birds, a passion she inherited from her maternal grandfather who kept tropical birds at his home in Lodsworth, West Sussex. She married Ken Duggan, an interior-design company director, and began breeding birds and showing them, often at stately homes, winning many prizes. Parrots were her speciality and her general Dr Dolittle qualities soon became apparent to the BBC. In 1964, the founding producer of Play School, Joy Whitby, hired her for the programme. Duggan's connections with the Zoological Society of London, of which she became a fellow in 1976, enabled her to provide all manner of animals including a baby elephant. The animals under her care were always safe and never exploited. She managed to ease the apprehension of the crew towards certain creatures, particularly snakes, but inevitably, things didn't always go to plan. Katoo would often nip the presenters and once, during a rehearsal, an eagle was spooked by a sound boom, flew up into the studio lights and showered the cast and crew with its droppings. On another occasion a baby chimp began to urinate on the studio floor during a live broadcast, necessitating the presenters to speak more loudly. After Ken's death, Wendy married Ron Riches, a former airline pilot, in 1968. Through her BBC connections she became a friend to many actors and celebrities including John Le Mesurier, Elaine Stritch, James Beck and Tony Hancock. On one occasion Hancock, who shared her love for animals, insisted on accompanying her to Charing Cross hospital, where she was overseeing the x-raying of rabbits to show children that the process was not harmful. He brought the radiology department down with laughter. She continued to supply animals for BBC children's programmes after Play School ended in 1988 and retired 10 years later. She is survived by Ron. \u2022 Wendy Eveline Duggan-Riches, animal adviser and ornithologist, born 31 January 1928; died 20 February 2012",

      "bodyText": "Police shot one man dead and took two others into custody during a shootout in the village of Culcheth, Cheshire on Saturday night. Local people watched in horror as armed police engaged in what was described as a \"pre-planned operation\", thought to be linked to a violent robbery two weeks ago in which a thief wearing a balaclava punched one shopkeeper in the face and threatened others with a machete. The police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), is now investigating events surrounding the death of the man after the vehicle he was in was stopped by police at about 7.20pm. Jessica Brown, a local schoolgirl, described how the shopping precinct in the quiet village turned into \"the set of a horror movie\" just prior to the fatal shooting. Brown was enjoying a night out in a pizza restaurant in the centre of the village when, she said: \"A couple ran in and said there was something going on. They told us to stand back against the wall. The people in the shop got down on the floor to make sure they could not be seen. \"There were loads of bangs from guns and people were running around outside screaming \u2026 I saw three men in gas masks with guns running \u2026 followed by two other men. \"Loads of police vans were parked across the road in the car park,\" she said. \"There were undercover police with guns walking around.\" Brown was picked up by a friend's father and as she was driven away, she saw a black van. \"As it drove past I heard bangs coming out of it,\" she said. \"There were two or three people in the van. \"I didn't believe it was happening. It was like an action film or the set of a horror movie. It was unreal.\" Jessica's father Anthony said his daughter only found out someone had been killed when she arrived home \"crying her eyes out\". BBC News reported that the shooting was linked to an investigation into armed robberies in the north-west and that the operation had been planned \"for some weeks\". Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: \"I understand there will be a lot of anxious people both in the Cheshire community where this happened and across Greater Manchester itself. I also understand there will inevitably be speculation about what happened and the events leading up to this man's death. \"Because there is an IPCC independent investigation, I cannot go into the specific details of the operation but equally I do want to provide some reassurance to people.\" A spokeswoman for Cheshire police added that the shooting was an isolated incident and there was no risk to the community as a whole. An IPCC spokeswoman confirmed they had investigators at the scene and working with officers from both Greater Manchester and Cheshire police.",

Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 1 January 2012 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D7000 Question: This Chinese mystery bird species is strongly sexually dimorphic. Can you tell me what are the differences that exist between males and females in this species? Why do these differences exist? Can you tell me which sex the mystery bird is? Can you identify this bird's taxonomic family and species? Response: This is a juvenile pied harrier, Circus melanoleucos, an Asian raptor that is part of the family Accipitridae. The pied harrier is placed into the genus, Circus, along with 14 of the 17 harrier species. (Two other harriers are in the genus Polyboroides, the harrier-hawks, restricted to the Afrotropics, whilst the one remaining species is placed into monotypic genus, Geranospiza.) The genus name, Circus, comes from the circling movements that adult birds make when courting. The pied harrier is strongly sexually dimorphic, with adult females being larger than males, and with both sexes showing strong plumage colour differences. This difference in plumage colour and pattern indicates that females choose their mates based on their plumage pattern, at least in part. Pied harriers are migratory, breeding in steppes and nearby wetlands stretching from the Amur valley in eastern Russia and north-eastern China to North Korea, and wintering from Pakistan to the Philippines, hunting above rice paddies and marshes. When hunting, harriers fly low over open fields and grasslands with wings angled up into a \"V\" shape, typically referred to as a dihedral shape. They prey mostly on rodents, lizards, frogs and small birds. Adult male pied harriers are pale grey with a black head, mantle, back, upper breast and tail coverts and a long silver-grey tail. In flight, the primaries are black above and below, and the black \"c\" shaped band across the upper wing coverts contrasts sharply with the silvery-grey wings. Here's a nice video of an adult male pied harrier, hunting (filmed in Goa, India, in 2005, uploaded 9 April 2010): Visit upnorthandwild's YouTube channel [video link]. The adult female has brown upperparts and buff-coloured underparts with brown streaks, white thighs, pale underwings with a darker broad trailing edge, long brown tail with darker brown barring, a pale brown face and a white rump patch. The juvenile looks similar to an adult female but has brown underwings and contrasting buff-coloured \"spectacles\" around its eyes, as visible in this photograph. This video gives a brief look at a hunting juvenile pied harrier (filmed at Chuping, Perlis, Malaysia on 17 Jan 2010; uploaded 19 January 2010): Visit digdeep1962's YouTube channel [video link].

      "bodyText": "Until the fall of the Berlin Wall, the popular British perception of German culture involved either a stout opera singer in a horned helmet warbling Wagner, or Nena on Top of the Pops singing about 99 Red Balloons. Much has changed in the intervening two decades, not least Berlin's coronation as a \"poor but sexy\" international capital of cool. Now the range of Germany's cultural influence, and the extent to which it has been embraced in the UK, will be revealed with a number of high-profile projects in London this summer. In June, the late choreographer Pina Bausch's revered dance company Tanztheater Wuppertal is coming to Sadler's Wells and the Barbican. The next month, Tate Modern's Turbine Hall will be filled with an installation by Tino Sehgal, a Berlin-based artist whose works involve performers interacting with viewers, which Tate Modern's director, Chris Dercon, describes as \"almost like a mental and bodily exercise\". From May, the Barbican will show Bauhaus: Art as Life, the biggest UK exhibition of the German modernist design school's work for 40 years. Later in the year the Serpentine gallery will exhibit the work of German artists Thomas Sch\u00fctte and Hans-Peter Feldmann. All five projects have been supported by the Goethe-Institut, founded to promote German culture, to celebrate its London branch's 50th anniversary and the reopening of its headquarters. Yet they are far from the only Teutonic heavyweights hitting the UK. In the last few days alone, Saturday saw composer Heiner Goebbels play the Southbank Centre in London , while on Friday Nottingham's Capital FM arena reverberated to the sounds \u2013 and pyrotechnics \u2013 of Rammstein, the heavy metal band. Even Paul Weller, once a quintessential Britrocker, is getting in on the act: his forthcoming album Sonik Kicks is partly inspired by 70s Krautrock band Neu! The rest of the world's growing preoccupation with German art was demonstrated in the title of an exhibition in New York last year curated by Anke Kempkes and the British critic Michael Bracewell: Germany is Your America. For Sabine Hentzsch, director of the Goethe-Institut London, such an influx of German culture is the culmination of a process that began with unification, when clubbers and fans of electronic music from the east and west came together to give Berlin its pounding techno soundtrack. The other factor, she says, is Berlin's cheapness and thriving subculture, which has made it the adopted home of artists from around the world, including Britain's Douglas Gordon and Tacita Dean. German artists have also settled in the UK, for instance Wolfgang Tillmans, who studied in Bournemouth and went on to win the Turner prize. In 2006 he told Butt magazine: \"I liked the smell of English homes and bathrooms, the mix of a damp carpet and apricot scented potpourri \u2026 Marmite, the repressed but omnipresent sexuality, weak milky tea on a rainy afternoon by the sea, the spongy bread \u2013 basically all the things people don't like, and what one would see as signs of how pathetic and backwards England was, or is, I liked.\" Dr Anja Baumhoff, lecturer in history of art and design at Loughborough University, who worked on the Barbican's Bauhaus show and has lived in the UK for eight years, believes the 2006 World Cup helped popularise German culture beyond artistic and intellectual circles. Now, she says, \"the fact that Germany is playing such a big political and economic role means that people are interested in what we're doing. It's not just a globalised world, it's a mobile world, and people are moving from the UK to travel back and forth from Berlin \u2013 it's not a big deal.\" However, the artists themselves are less interested in representing Germany than exploring the ambiguities of being at the meeting point of several cultures. \"If you travel a lot you feel a certain proximity to every culture but also a kind of distance,\" says Sehgal, who was born in London to a German mother and Indian father. He points to his 2005 installation in the German pavilion at the Venice Biennale. There, three guards jumped out of their chairs and hopped around chanting in English: \"This is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary!\" \"In the German pavilion a heavy, relatively dark piece is expected. I decided to do something quite light, in English, with a touch of humour,\" Sehgal said. Not that this means his Turbine Hall installation will be German in tone: \"We've been thinking a lot about English culture, but not in a direct way influencing the piece. I experience London as a crossroads. The Turbine Hall belongs to this increasingly global moment more than the Centre Pompidou, which opened 30 years ago \u2013 that's my feeling.\" \"London has been celebrating German art since Anthony D'Offay,\" says Dercon, referring to the gallerist who in the 80s represented some of the country's most significant artists, from Joseph Beuys to Gerhard Richter. \"We are very well informed about what's going on in Germany and that's why the Geothe-Institut is saying let's go deeper and let's see where it's heading.\" However, there are some aspects of German culture that still have little traction in the UK. Hentzsch says it is still difficult to find German contemporary authors in English translations in the UK. Baumhoff says that \"the Brits don't like modernism \u2013 just look at Prince Charles\". Finally, there's pop music. \"The Germans have embraced British culture for the last 50 years \u2013 big time,\" Sehgal says. \"German pop music is on a much lower level of reception in Germany. There's no German Adele.\"",

      "bodyText": "On Saturday night in Los Angeles a group of A-listers tried to walk the precarious line between aesthetics and public service. George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Kevin Bacon took part in a staged reading of Dustin Lance Black's dramatic adaptation of the landmark case that overturned California's anti-gay marriage referendum, Proposition 8. The result is a little wobbly. 8 is a condensed, episodic, collage of trial highlights, hammily read by a group of bafflingly good-looking people. Watching Pitt, his long straw-coloured hair pulled back and matted down, put on the sterilised airs of a US federal court judge, is somewhat distracting (Is Brad Pitt smart, by the way? He seems kind of smart. But whenever he recites smart dialogue it sounds like those words have never formed in his mouth before. Like the word 'statute'.) 8 is not an artful blend of technique and subject matter. The novelty of watching film stars, meant to add a little glamour to turgid court proceedings, wears off quickly, the selections of testimony for the first 30 minutes seem arbitrary, and the defendant transcripts were cherrypicked to sound as myopic as possible with the prosecution always getting the last, devastating word. Still, the raw bits of the judicial record are at times so stunning they provide enough pathos to make 8 a lasting social document about the fight for American civil rights. \"Today we put fear and prejudice on trial,\" Martin Sheen, playing prosecutor Theodore Olson, says to the recreated courtroom. With his trademark crystalline elocution and paternal manner, Sheen channels all the moral authority he earned during his tenure as the West Wing's president Josiah Bartlet. \"How does preventing same sex couples from getting married advance the interest of procreation [of a straight] married couple,\" he asks the defence team pointedly. Judge Vaughn Walker, played by Pitt, also puts the question to the defence. \"What empirical evidence do you have?\" The response from defence attorney, David Thompson, played by Kevin Bacon: \"I \u2026 I don't know.\" 8 has a purpose: to make public something that was made private. The lawsuit against Prop 8 (Perry v Schwarzenegger) would have been the first federal trial to live stream in some public courthouses and on YouTube. Two days before the trial's start date, the defendants, Protectmarrige.com and Campaign for California Families (the state declined to be represented in the trial) filed emergency papers for the supreme court to block broadcasting. The supreme court voted along ideological lines and ruled in favour of the block. The trial began with the prosecution calling upon scholars, psychologists and gay couples for their testimony. 8 is an abridged version of the testimony and courtroom tete-a-tete with interstitial scenes between the plaintiff's family. The highlights though, are with the defence. Like the Dred Scott decision, the Scopes \"Monkey\" trial, or Brown v the Board of Education, the most fascinating historical figures in this drama are those who stand in the way of history's lurching towards enlightenment. The best part of the Abraham Lincoln versus Stephen Douglas debates was always Douglas. In 8 it's the piss-poor defence of Prop 8. The defence only called two witnesses. Both were submitted as experts. Dr Hak-Shing William Tan (played by gay actor George Takei) claimed if Prop 8 was not upheld, \"other states would fall into the hands of Satan, one by one\". Pressed for sources, Tan replied: \"The internet\". The other witness, David Blankenhorn, founder of the Institute for American Values, was so incoherent and contradictory, he was dismissed by Walker as unreliable and entitled to no weight. Casting John C Reilly as Blankenhorn may have been a little too rich, for Reilly's greatest quality, besides his flubby bulldog features, is the earnest manner in which he tries to prove to you he is not a buffoon. Clooney as prosecutor David Boies plays it suave, as is his wont (Nothing seems worth doing unless Clooney is having a good time, right?). He clearly delights in his role as the noble prosecutor, peering over the top of his glasses, tie loosened, shooting sarcastic smirks. Jamie Lee Curtis and Christine Lahti are believable and sincere as the plaintiffs, a same sex couple whose marriage licence was denied. Bacon is, surprisingly, the most natural and engaging to watch. His \"I don't know\" admission followed by a skittish recantation is deftly done and gives us the kind of cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 this project clearly craves. Many scenes are abrupt, truncated and a little difficult to follow for lack of context but Black does give us some real moments of grace when he slows down and lets the natural drama play. Most moving is the testimony of Ryan Kendall, played by gay American television actor Chris Colfer, who was once enrolled in \"reparative therapy\" for his homosexuality. When his parents read his private journal, they were aghast. His mother told him she hated him and he would rot in hell. \"You don't get anything worse than eternal damnation,\" he recounts mournfully. His parents flew him to a clinic in Encino, California, that purported to \"convert\" homosexuals to heterosexuals. When asked if the therapy worked, he cheerfully replies: \"No, I am just as gay as I was when it first started.\" The play closed to a standing ovation. The real life couples, their families, Boies and Olson joined the all-star cast on stage. Boies took the microphone and made the best case for the dramatic reading of the messy jurisprudence: if the trial had actually been broadcast it's unlikely that most would have watched the whole way through. \"We put fear and prejudice on trial,\" he concluded. \"And fear and prejudice lost.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012. The original said that the case goes to the supreme court later this year. This has been removed as incorrect. In addition, the original referred to the testimony of an unidentified man once enrolled in \"reparative therapy\". This has been corrected.",

The supreme court voted along ideological lines and ruled in favour of the block.</p> <p>The trial began with the prosecution calling upon scholars, psychologists and gay couples for their testimony. 8 is an abridged version of the testimony and courtroom tete-a-tete with interstitial scenes between the plaintiff's family.</p> <p>The highlights though, are with the defence. Like the Dred Scott decision, the Scopes \"Monkey\" trial, or Brown v the Board of Education, the most fascinating historical figures in this drama are those who stand in the way of history's lurching towards enlightenment. The best part of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Douglas_debates\" title=\"\">Abraham Lincoln versus Stephen Douglas debates</a> was always Douglas. In 8 it's the piss-poor defence of Prop 8.</p> <p>The defence only called two witnesses. Both were submitted as experts. Dr Hak-Shing William Tan (played by gay actor George Takei) claimed if Prop 8 was not upheld, \"other states would fall into the hands of Satan, one by one\". Pressed for sources, Tan replied: \"The internet\". The other witness, David Blankenhorn, founder of the <a href=\"http://www.americanvalues.org/\" title=\"\">Institute for American Values</a>, was so incoherent and contradictory, he was dismissed by Walker as unreliable and entitled to no weight.</p> <p>Casting John C Reilly as Blankenhorn may have been a little too rich, for Reilly's greatest quality, besides his flubby bulldog features, is the earnest manner in which he tries to prove to you he is not a buffoon.</p> <p>Clooney as prosecutor David Boies plays it suave, as is his wont (Nothing seems worth doing unless Clooney is having a good time, right?). He clearly delights in his role as the noble prosecutor, peering over the top of his glasses, tie loosened, shooting sarcastic smirks.</p> <p>Jamie Lee Curtis and Christine Lahti are believable and sincere as the plaintiffs, a same sex couple whose marriage licence was denied.</p> <p>Bacon is, surprisingly, the most natural and engaging to watch. His \"I don't know\" admission followed by a skittish recantation is deftly done and gives us the kind of cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 this project clearly craves.</p> <p>Many scenes are abrupt, truncated and a little difficult to follow for lack of context but Black does give us some real moments of grace when he slows down and lets the natural drama play.</p> <p>Most moving is the testimony of Ryan Kendall, played by gay American television actor Chris Colfer, who was once enrolled in \"reparative therapy\" for his homosexuality. When his parents read his private journal, they were aghast. His mother told him she hated him and he would rot in hell.</p> <p>\"You don't get anything worse than eternal damnation,\" he recounts mournfully. His parents flew him to a clinic in Encino, California, that purported to \"convert\" homosexuals to heterosexuals. When asked if the therapy worked, he cheerfully replies: \"No, I am just as gay as I was when it first started.\"</p> <p>The play closed to a standing ovation. The real life couples, their families, Boies and Olson joined the all-star cast on stage. Boies took the microphone and made the best case for the dramatic reading of the messy jurisprudence: if the trial had actually been broadcast it's unlikely that most would have watched the whole way through.</p> <p>\"We put fear and prejudice on trial,\" he concluded. \"And fear and prejudice lost.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012. The original said that the case goes to the supreme court later this year. This has been removed as incorrect. In addition, the original referred to the testimony of an unidentified man once enrolled in \"reparative therapy\". This has been corrected.</p>",

Classical Jakob Lenz Sam Brown directs Wolfgang Rihm's early expressionist one-acter for ENO, with Andrew Shore in the title role of the schizophrenic 18th-century poet. Hampstead Theatre, London NW3 (020 7722 9301), 17 to 27 April. Jazz Tim Berne's Snakeoil New York saxist/composer Berne has overseen plenty of abrasive contemporary electric music over the years, but this Snakeoil quartet is an unusual combination of rugged lyricism and chamber-group acoustic subtleties, significantly influenced by the innovative Oscar Noriega on clarinets.

      "bodyText": "Finally the pitch was playable but still no winner could be found. Instead it was French minds which froze at the very moment when a stirring comeback victory looked imminent. Twice Lionel Beauxis settled back into the pocket with the aim of kicking the drop-goal which would have swung this rescheduled contest. Twice he was charged down by a wave of onrushing green spoilsports. Short of organising a third Parisian date later this year, this fixture seems destined to yield only frustration. By far the happiest Six Nations coach will be Wales's Warren Gatland. With two rounds left to play in a fluctuating tournament, the Welsh are the only side still chasing a grand slam. A hefty victory over Italy next week could make Wales almost impossible to catch, particularly if England finish strongly against France and Ireland. An unlikely English title could still materialise on Stuart Lancaster's watch, however, if results go their way. \"It's going to be a huge game against our friends England on Sunday,\" acknowledged the France coach, Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9. \"We will need to be desperate.\" There was, even so, a note of uncertainty in his voice. It will do England \u2013 and Wales \u2013 no harm that both these sides are being required to play four Tests in as many weekends. On this evidence, and by Saint-Andr\u00e9's own admission, the French midfield have little answer to a stifling rush defence which just happens to be one of England's fortes. If the visitors take their chances as smartly as Tommy Bowe did to propel his side into a 17-6 interval lead, it is possible to envisage yet another tight finish in a season full of them. \"England will be fresher, physically and mentally than us,\" said Saint-Andr\u00e9. \"It will require a lot of commitment, desperation and cleverer strategy.\" Ireland, for their part, may have to replace their scrum-half Conor Murray, who departed on a stretcher in the second half with a hyperextended knee. He is not believed to have suffered serious ligament damage but there is scant time for recuperation. Ireland host Scotland this Saturday and the amount of defending they had to do in pouring rain in the second half will have drained some forward legs. Declan Kidney's team cannot now win the title unless Wales lose to the Italians in Cardiff, a distinctly unlikely scenario. That explained why both teams had the air of losers after a classic game of two halves. Saint-Andr\u00e9 will be particularly aggrieved by the two costly tries conceded in the opening 40 minutes. Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie will have nightmares about the casual floated pass which yielded an interception try for Bowe after 14 minutes and gave Ireland a morale-boosting seven-point gift. The French defence out wide was also fatally slow to spot the danger a couple of minutes before half-time when turnover ball was moved right to Bowe who chipped over Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud, regathered and waltzed over for his second score. As Bowe is still currently playing his club rugby for the Swansea-based Ospreys, it was a popular moment on both sides of the Irish Sea. It was less a case of Irish luck than French mediocrity, although the visitors did enjoy a little good fortune of their own. Ireland could have had two men in the sin-bin before half-time for professional fouls, Gordon D'Arcy cynically snuffing out a French attack in the shadow of his own posts and Cian Healy getting blatantly in the way of Vincent Clerc while jogging back having received treatment upfield. Morgan Parra did kick a couple of penalties but the punishment was a relative one. \"At half-time the glass was definitely half empty,\" said Saint-Andr\u00e9. \"We had a lot of issues with their rush defence. I told the players to be tight and aware of their defence. You can't give points like that to Ireland, particularly in Irish-type weather like this.\" The visitors, though, reckoned without a French pack seemingly refreshed by the sweeping rain. In the shape of the pacy Wesley Fofana they also have one of the sharpest finishers in the tournament, the Clermont centre leaving Rob Kearney trailing to score his third try in as many games. Parra missed the conversion but his fourth penalty tied up the scores. While a draw, in the end, was probably fair, it did not feel that way to the Irish. \"I'm disappointed for the lads,\" admitted Kidney, declining to dig too deep for positives. \"If you're not disappointed when you don't win you shouldn't be in the job.\" The championship outcome, though, remains far from cut and dried.

      "bodyText": "Pity the poor accompanist, condemned to sit in the shadow of the great voices and the even greater egos of today's singers. Being the pianist who plays for them can feel like the most thankless job in music. The singers couldn't do it without them, but it's the braying sopranos and the yodelling tenors who get all the glory, as well as most of the cash and applause \u2013 despite the fact that all they've done is sing a few tunes, usually in a foreign language, while the pianists slog their guts out playing fiendishly difficult accompaniments by Schubert, Schumann or Britten. It's a life that Roger Vignoles, the veteran British accompanist who has worked with everyone from Kiri Te Kanawa to Anne Sofie Von Otter, laments in his hilarious song The Battle Hymn of the Accompanist. \"I only make believe I'm following their Lieder,\" he sings. \"That's what I'm staying for/ That's what I'm playing for/ Art is calling for \u2013 me!\" And later: \"You may think this job sucks/ When they get all the bucks/ Forget their lines, transpose/ And jump from page to page!\" After four decades at the top of his profession, however, Vignoles is finally getting to call the shots, having curated a series of eight concerts at the Wigmore Hall in London. Billed as a showcase of song that will celebrate the relationship between pianist and singer, the series features such sopranos as Joan Rodgers and Sandrine Piau. Vignoles will still be on the piano, of course, but for once it's his baby, his name in lights. How would he sum up his craft? \"I sometimes describe it as the art of getting what you want without the other person noticing.\" The archetypal British accompanist was Gerald Moore, who lamented his plight just as passionately as Vignoles, despite the fact that he was assisting the likes of Elizabeth Schwarzkopf. \"We accompanists,\" Moore said in his 1960s recording The Unashamed Accompanist, \"have our minds above such mundane things as fees. But I would like people to realise what extremely important people we accompanists are. The most enchanting lady walks on to sing, and all the ladies look at her because of what she's wearing, and all the men look at her because \u2013 well, all the men look at her. And nobody looks at me. And I can't blame them. Nobody notices the accompanist at all. He looks so slender and shy and so modest that people think he's there just to do what he's told, to follow the singer through thick and thin. Well, there's a great deal more to it than that.\" You would have thought that, by now, musical culture would have twigged that there's more to a song recital than the singer. But is anyone really listening to what these toiling accompanists are doing? As pianist Anna Tilbrook \u2013 who plays for, among others, tenor James Gilchrist \u2013 puts it: \"These songs would sound pretty strange without the piano.\" Iain Burnside, another seasoned accompanist, agrees. \"I always think of what my mentor, Eric Sams, said \u2013 that the whole song repertoire is a piano art form rather than a singer's. After all, the great Lieder and song composers were pianists.\" This is a good point: think of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, Faur\u00e9 and Debussy. \"Hardly any of them sang,\" says Burnside. \"Once you've got that idea in your brain, it's hard to be comfortable with the idea that what you're doing is merely 'accompanying'.\" And in Lieder, of course, it's the pianist who leads. \"I hate the term accompanist,\" continues Burnside. \"You can't deny there are connotations that it's a secondary entity. But unfortunately I can't think of a better one. If you insist on being called a pianist then people think that you're comparing yourself to Sviatoslav Richter. That's not what it's about: you're just asking to be taken seriously in your own right.\" It's not just in the fees that Burnside sees inequality, but in the promotion, the fact that the singer \u2013 or instrumental soloist \u2013 has their name in lights, while the pianist's name appears as an afterthought on the CD cover, poster or review. \"When a 'proper' pianist like Andr\u00e1s Schiff or Mitsuko Uchida plays for a singer, they will get half the review, whereas when I'm playing the same repertoire \u2013 or Roger, or any of us \u2013 we'll get one adjective, usually 'sensitive', and that's it.\" The irony is that the colour, range and collaborative alchemy that a skilled accompanist will deliver is precisely what a professional soloist, be it Schiff or Uchida, would struggle to create. Tilbrook knows what it's like to be regarded as the backdrop. \"There are singers you build up a rapport with,\" she says. \"But you also get a soprano who says you've got to wear a more understated dress than hers so you don't upstage her. Maybe that's why there are hardly any female accompanists.\" While Vignoles embraces life as an accompanist, he is determined for it to be seen as an art form in its own right. That means celebrating the things accompanists can do that no other musicians can. He talks of the piano as a reservoir of colour that needs to create the infinite emotional variety required in everything from Schubert to Debussy,Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Dvor\u02c7\u00e1k to Copland. But it's more subtle even than that. \"Every voice you play for requires a different background,\" he says. \"Every person you work with is giving you something different all the time. My playing has become much more interesting because of that, because of all the people I've had to work my playing against. The most exciting thing is when something new happens in a concert, when you say to each other afterwards, 'We've never done it like that before, but it was right for that moment.'\" More than anything else, what unifies these accompanists, in their passionate but egoless profession, is the thrill of doing justice to magnificent music. \"There's no getting away from the fact that the greatest songs ever written are in a foreign language,\" says Vignoles. \"But what they are all really about is universal human experiences. That's the most important thing we do: project natural human feelings in a way that transcends time and place.\" Vignoles talks of a virtual telepathy, moments when he knows what the singer is going to do before they do, invisible connections that bind his fingers and their voice. As Burnside says, \"You build up a kind of musical radar. You become attuned to a singer's breathing, you get a sense of what their breath span is, and when they're likely to be heading for trouble. It's quite a private, sensual thing, listening to someone's breath that intently.\" Tilbrook says there are times when she has saved singers from embarrassment. \"The real art is to have that sixth sense, knowing when they are going to have a memory lapse, when they're going to come in a bar early or even skip a whole verse. You have to be able to cover all that in your playing, so smoothly that no one notices.\" Doesn't that mean Tilbrook is allowing these singers to get away with murder \u2013 and getting none of the credit for her skilled coverups? \"Yes! But I love to be able to do that. It's great when you think no one would have known there was a mistake. You have to be totally on your mettle, totally in the moment \u2013 and totally aware of the person you're accompanying.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ministers have scrapped guidelines setting out how much homework children should be set, in a move intended to give headteachers greater freedom. Under the last government, guidance was issued to all schools recommending they have a policy on homework. At the time, homework was common in secondary schools but practices varied at primary level. The guidelines suggested children aged five to seven should be set an hour a week, rising to half-an-hour a night for seven- to 11-year-olds. Secondary schools were encouraged to set as much as two and-a- half hours a night for children aged 14-16. There is controversy about the value of homework, with critics saying it is either ineffective or potentially harmful if the extra work is so dull that children switch off. A greater emphasis on homework can also unfairly benefit pupils from more affluent homes, as they are more likely to have a quiet place to study. Ann Donaghy, assistant principal of Smith's Wood sports college, in Solihull, West Midlands, said: \"If homework is set well then it can be useful \u2013 if it consolidates learning. \"But often it's not. Often, it's an extension to finish off work and it doesn't aid the child. \"There's pressure from external sources to set homework. There's a comment in the new Ofsted [inspection] framework where they mention homework, and a lot of teachers see that as if they must be setting homework all the time, even if it's not necessary.\" A review of academic research has found the impact of homework on primary age children is \"inconclusive\", while there is a \"relatively modest\" effect on older pupils. Time spent on homework had a small impact on pupils' results at secondary school, the 2001 review by the National Foundation for Educational Research found. It quoted one study that found A-level students who spent seven hours or more on homework per week achieved results that were only a third of a grade higher than students of the same sex and ability who did homework for less than two hours a week. Education secretary Michael Gove has encouraged schools to extend the length of the day, raising the prospect of more schools supporting pupils as they study in the evening rather than setting them work to take home. Donaghy welcomed the decision to scrap the homework guidance. She said: \"Allowing headteachers to have more autonomy is a good idea as they understand the context of their school.\" While homework is controversial, experts agree on the value of parents taking an interest in their children's intellectual life. Results from the OECD Pisa study, which compares school systems around the world, finds a strong association between children's reading performance at 15, and home activities such as discussing politics, talking about books or films and eating meals together as a family. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers' annual conference voted in favour of abolishing homework for primary school pupils in 2009, saying it was \"a waste of children's time\". TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp, who has campaigned against homework for primary schoolchildren, has described it as a \"constant battle that gets in the way of all the real ways kids learn. Going to the park. Reading together. Even just talking, interacting with the rest of the family.\" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"Homework is part and parcel of a good education \u2013 along with high quality teaching and strong discipline. We trust headteachers to set the homework policy for their school. They know their pupils best and should be free to make these decisions without having to adhere to unnecessary bureaucratic guidance.\"",

      "bodyText": "My father, Sao Hseng Ong, who has died aged 86, was a member of one of the traditional ruling families of Burma. He was born in Heho, Shan State, the second son of Sao Shwe Thaike, the Saopha Long or ruling prince of Yawnghwe, and his wife, Sao Nang Yee, the First Mahadevi, or \"celestial princess\". Hseng's boarding school in Taunggyi was set up like a British public school, with the pupils learning cricket and football. In 1938, at the age of 12, he was sent to be educated abroad, at the King's school, Canterbury. Hseng studied agriculture at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he made lifelong friends, including John Loveridge, who later became a Conservative MP. Hseng spent school holidays in Bradford, in the care of a Yorkshire couple, the Neals. Towards the end of the second world war, he carried out home guard duties on the Cornish coast \u2013 although he was sometimes mistaken for a Japanese soldier. After university, he spent a year in Trinidad before he returned to Burma, and married Sao Hom Noan (known as Audrey), a Shan princess. During the 1950s he worked in the ministry of agriculture in Burma, where he led a malaria control programme. Later, he worked for ICI in Rangoon. In 1962, there was a military coup d'\u00e9tat.

      "bodyText": "Preamble. So for the second time in three weeks Ireland head to Paris in search of their second win in 40 years. The cancellation of the match 22 days ago less than 10 minutes before kick off with the players waiting to come onto the pitch and 80,000 people in the ground was the sporting equivalent o9f being jilted at the altar. There was one positive for Declan Kidney's men: at least they got to return home without having lost. The good news is that unless the players decide that their expensively coiffured hair can't handle a bit of rain then we will get a game today. In the meantime Ireland have beaten the Italians convincingly while France stuttered to victory at Murrayfield. Those performances have given Ireland more grounds for optimism than they had 22 days ago (when the crushing disappointment of the manner of defeat to Wales still lingered) and Kidney's strategy remained unaltered. \"I think it's been more an outside view, than in the dressing room,\" he said of the statistic of one win in Paris in 40 years. \"They know it's in their hands. It's not a case of having to do anything different. But the French always lift their game at home. We need to concentrate and be physical for the full 80 minutes. When you have the ball, don't cough it up; when you don't have it, be rock solid in defence.\" So that's it then. Concentrate. Be physical. And no coughing. The magic formula for victory in Paris. Kick off is 3pm (GMT). Here are the two line-ups ... France: C Poitrenaud (Toulouse); V Clerc (Toulouse), A Rougerie (Clermont Auvergne), W Fofana (Clermont Auvergne), J Malzieu (Clermont Auvergne); F Trinh-Duc (Montpellier), M Parra (Clermont Auvergne); J-B Poux (Toulouse), D Szarzewski (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), N Mas (Perpignan), P Pap\u00e9 (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), Y Maestri (Toulouse), T Dusautoir (Toulouse, capt), J Bonnaire (Clermont Auvergne), I Harinordoquy (Biarritz). Replacements: W Servat (Toulouse), V Debaty (Clermont Auvergne), L Nallet (Racing M\u00e9tro), L Picamoles (Toulouse), J Dupuy (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), L Beauxis (Toulouse), M Mermoz (Perpignan). Ireland: R Kearney (Leinster); T Bowe (Ospreys), K Earls (Munster), G D'Arcy (Leinster), A Trimble (Ulster); J Sexton (Leinster), C Murray (Munster); C Healy (Leinster), R Best (Ulster), M Ross (Leinster), D O'Callaghan (Munster), P O'Connell (Munster, capt), S Ferris (Ulster), S O'Brien (Leinster), J Heaslip (Leinster). Replacements: S Cronin (Leinster), T Court (Ulster), D Ryan (Munster), P O'Mahony (Munster), E Reddan (Leinster), R O'Gara (Munster), F McFadden (Leinster). Referee: Dave Pearson (Eng). 2.35pm: Ireland have loaned France some great men over the years - Joyce, Beckett, Cascarino. It's about time they started giving something back. 2.42pm: Obviously the news that Chelsea have parted company with Andr\u00e9 Villas Boas puts this game into perspective but we will battle on regardless. 2.49pm: Breaking news ... Paul O'Connell doesn't want to get his head wet so the game is off. 2.51pm: So there is now a raging selection debate about both the Ireland half-back positions. Murray and Sexton wear the No9 and 10 today with O'Gara and Reddan on the bench. Discuss. Or don't. The teams are on the pitch. Here come the anthems ... 2.56pm: Just one anthem for the Irish today - a jaunty version of Ireland's Call \u2013 will that halve their strength? Or maybe it will double it. Who knows? La Marseillaise is belted out in a stadium that's not quite full. Peeeep!!!!: Dave Pearson blows his whistle and Jonny Sexton gets the game underway with Ireland playing from left to right. 1 min: Sexton puts an early up-and-under to test the France full back Poitrenaud who is not quite convincing under the high ball. Trinh-Duc then launches a high kick which Tommy Bowe deals with well. 3 min: A dynamic break from the French, first through Poitrenaud whose break is brought to a halt by Murray. France work it to the right flank to Clerc who advances into the Ireland half but the Irish rearguard stays strong. France scrum. 4 min: The France scrum is good but there's strong defence from Ireland as Sexton and Ferris snare Rougerie and keep him off the ground, turning it into a maul rather than a ruck, and eventually the scrum is given Ireland's way. Good defence. They may need it to stay at that level over the next 80 minutes. 6 min: Penalty to Ireland after France lifted a man on the ground. It's central but close to halfway ... 7 min: ... Sexton misses the penalty. He pulls the kick to the left of the posts as he was faces them and it remains France 0-0 Ireland. 10 min: A sloppy French scrum and Ireland turnover but are then penalised for not releasing on the ground and Trinh-Duc clears deep into he Irish 22. That's a real waste from Ireland. They did the hard work in turning over and now they're under real pressure. 12 min: It's slightly rabid defence from Ireland but it's effective. They force Clerc backwards and then Kearney makes a perfect claim from a high kick. He kicks for touch and the pressure is relieved for the time being at least. 12 min: TRY!!! France 0-5 IRELAND. It's the most simple try Tommy Bowe will ever score. He intercepted a telegraphed pass from Rougerie and ambled under the posts to touchdown. 13 min: CONVERSION! France 0-7 IRELAND. Sexton makes no mistake from under the posts. Perfect start for Ireland. 16 min: This is a really good display so far from Ireland. The defence has been strong and, though the try was a gift, they have been trying to get at France and expose their backline at every opportunity. \"Is it just me or has the quality of goal-kicking dropped markedly in the past few years?\" asks Niall Mullen. \"I've seen several of the worst penalty attempts I've ever seen in this year's 6 Nations. Mind you they were all from Italy.\" 18 min: A story of the match in two kicks: Tommy Bowe picks up a French kick under no pressure at all. Poitrenaud is slammed by Kearney with two other green shirts lurking as he collects Bowe's return. It's a little too enthusiastic from Ireland - they're penalised - but still, France are far too lax. 18 min: Ireland turn over again. It really is frenetic defensive display. They are dominant now and the French crowd are already on their team's backs. The next challenge for Kidney's side is to get their dominance reflected on the scoreboard. No problem. 19 min: \"Just watching the rugby after completing a 26 venue A-Z pub crawl in Bristol yesterday,\" says Phillip Wainwright. \"Have you noticed the amount of time in this 6N that SH's are spending mincing about at the base of a ruck waiting for nothing in particular? Youngs (spectacularly so), Dickson and Parra have been guilty as far as I've seen but I'm sure Phillips et al have been equally culpable. Is there a rule about this? It's really annoying not to mention boring to watch. Rant over. Happy Sunday!\" More pressingly is it acceptable to have a half-pint on a pub crawl. I would think not. 21 min: This is more like it from the French. there's some swift and clean passing with Trinh-Duc starting the move, and Ireland are penalised for an offside and Parra will have a shot at goal ... 22 min: PENALTY! FRANCE 3-7 Ireland. Parra makes no mistake from close range. 25 min: Penalty to Ireland after a French forward failed to roll away from a ruck. Conor Murray threatens to take a tap kick but then sees sense and Sexton will kick at goal. 26 min: PENALTY! France 3-10 IRELAND. Sexton has two from three as he slots this between the sticks. Ireland look a little laboured with the ball in their hands but if the French defensive indiscipline continues then they will have chances to keep the scoreboard ticking over. 28 min: Very nearly another interception for Tommy Bowe. He goes at the loose pass one-handed but can't gather and knocks on. It's a strong scrum from the French and Ireland are penalised for wheeling the scrum. Parra will kick at goal from just inside the Irish half ... 3.32pm: PENALTY! FRANCE 6-10 Ireland. Parra's kick clips the bar and goers over and the flags are raised. 31 min: From the restart France take possession and Trinh-Duc launches a kick downfield which pitches and runs and deceives Trimble and scuttles into touch inside the Ireland 22. 32 min: This is great defence from Ireland and Sexton is particular. The 'choke and hold' is working a treat - as it did against Australia in the World Cup - and Ireland are awarded a scrum on halfway. RE: Scrum halves at the baser of rucks, Gareth Owen (more qualified as a ref than Brian Moore) writes: To answer your correspondant: there's no explicit Law, but refs are at liberty to decide that the ball is not going to emerge in a timely fashion and award a scrum to the last team moving forward. A quiet word to \"use it\" will usually suffice.\" 34 min: Penalty for France but no yellow card as Cian Healy is waddling back from an offside position and trips over the ball. In the midst of that French move Bowe nearly made another interception. 34 min: Parra misses the penalty. That's a let-off for Ireland. It stays France 6-10 Ireland. Unfortunately the picture I'm watching is reliant on a French director who thinks he's Francois Truffaut so apologies if the identity of certain players is mixed up. It's all upshots and moody lighting with this guy. 37 min: TRY!!! France 6-15 IRELAND. What a brilliant try from Tommy Bowe. Earls handed off right on the touchline. From a French point of view he's got to be knocked into touch but Bowe ambled forwards, chipped over Malzieu, collected the pass, dummied and crossed for his second try of the game. 39 min: CONVERSION!! Sexton's kick (just about) drifts over thanks to some late fade and it's France 6-17 Ireland. Half time: FRANCE 6-17 Ireland. Ireland have never led at half time in France. They've broken that record now. It's been a great performance so far, full of intensity and purpose. Can they keep it up? We shall see. Peeeep!!: The second half is underway. Can Ireland maintain the level of intensity, concentration and effort? Can France find any intensity, concentration and effort? 42 min: Paul O'Connell is judged to have knocked on in a lineout and France have the put-in just outside the Irish 22. France are pushing now with Murray and Sexton excelling in defence. The fling the ball right to Rougerie but his pass to Poitrenaud is so so careless and the France No15 can't gather and knocks on. Big scrum for Ireland. 45 min: It's a good scrum from Ireland but then D'Arcy nearly gets himself in trouble before Sexton's slightly sliced clearance finds touch. 46 min: Penalty advantage to France as Mas tries to make ground. Rougerie then tries to break through midfield, is held up and there is no advantage so Parra will kick at goal ... 47 min: PENALTY! FRANCE 9-17 Ireland. Parra's left footed kick from 15m inside the left touchline (just) drifts between the sticks and the Ireland lead is now eight points. 49 min: It's a dangerous looking attack from Ireland as Trimble advances but Rougerie knocks the ball from his possession, Heaslip trips over it and Dave Pearson decides it's an Ireland knock on. 50 min: TRY!!! FRANCE 14-17 Ireland. I have barely mentioned him today but Fofana is the France danger man and he has his third try in three games. It's sent upstairs for some reason - he was nowhere near touch and the ball was cleanly grounded - and unsurprisingly the try is awarded. 51 min: The conversion is missed but the damage is done. I don't know what Ireland were playing at in midfield - there was a loose ball which Earls tried to kick ahead rather than drop on. He missed, it was popped into Fofana's hands and he raced clear. 57 min: Rob Kearney very nearly gains ground on the right touchline but a flailing French hand taps his heels, trips him and he goes into touch. France forge forward and have a penalty. Parra will shoot for goal but it's a long way out. Ireland are being dominated now. 58 min: PENALTY! FRANCE 17-17 Ireland. Great kick from Parra. It slots right between the sticks and it's level but Ireland are flagging. Donnacha Ryan comes on for O'Callaghan. They desperately need some fresh impetus and aggression in the front eight. 4.18pm: Conor Murray picks ups a bad looking knee injury. That's the end of his game (and possibly his Six Nations) and Eoin Reddan is on. This is set up for a French victory or Ronan O'Gara heroics. Vote now to decide. 62 min: There is a desperation to the Irish defending now which wasn't there in the first half when it was more an example of controlled aggression. It's still reasonably effective as Rory Best turns over. A typically defiant break from Kearney launches an Ireland attack, their first real foray forward this half. 64 min: Great passage of play from Ireland. Parra brings down Sexton. Ferris then makes a break, tries to keep the ball alive and the last touch is from a man in blue and Ireland have the lineout 10 metres from the French line. 65 min: Terrible lineout - it's over thrown by Best (not for the first time today) and O'Connell can't gather. France claim the ball, Trinh-Duc boots clear and Ireland make a flurry of changes including O'Mahony for Sean O'Brien. 66 min: Much better lineout throw from best and Trimble breaks the gain line. This is a good passage from Ireland and they've reversed the momentum of the opening 25 minutes of the half. They've yet to make it count on the scoreboard. 67 min: That's sloppy from D'Arcy - he lets the wet ball slip from his grasp - and Ireland lose the ball. That could be a big big moment. Nil points from that five minute period of dominance. 68 min: Ireland aren't ready to surrender the ball just yet. It's another wonderful take from the immense Kearney - that's his third outrageous catch of the game. This one was so much Harinordoquy's ball it may as well have been in his living room, but Kearney gathered and Ireland attack before Earls is knocked into touch. 71 min: Ireland have the ball but no momentum. Sexton chips into the 22 and Poitrenaud claims. takes his mark and clears to close to halfway. Picamoles comes on from France and O'Gara is on for Ireland, but for D'Arcy rather than Sexton. Ireland have the ball and need points. Three points, five points, seven points. Anything. 72 min: They're not going to get any of those as France clear into the Irish half. Can they succeed where Ireland failed and get points on the board? No is the answer as Beauxis tries a drop goal from a long way out but a three-;egged Jack Russell would get closer than that effort. 74 min: Ireland are penalised for handling in the ruck after O'Gara made a good break. That's sloppy and France can surge again with a lineout on the Ireland 22. 77 min: France are bashing down the Ireland door which is being held in place by O'Connell and Ferris. France set-up another drop goal attempt for Beauxis but Ferris is on him like a shot and charges it down. 78 min: Here come France again - they're on the Ireland 22. Ireland need to be disciplined here. They are. Ireland win a penalty as the French fail to release on the ground and O'Gara can clear to halfway. That's brilliant defending. 80 min: It's another unconvincing lineout but Ireland somehow retain the ball. At least they do until Heaslip loses it and France have the scrum just inside the Ireland half. One last final test of Ireland's defence and discipline. Time is up. 80 min: The scrum isn't binding as La Marseillaise is belted out by the crowd. France are too far out for a drop goal so will have to make considerable ground or hope for a penalty. France work the overlap on the left and Malzieu bursts for the line but more great (and desperate) Irish tackling forces him out of play and that is that ... Full time: France 17-17 Ireland. After all that it's a draw. Maybe they could have just agreed that after the first game was called off? The real winners in this are Wales. 4.47pm: Paul O'Connell says Ireland are very disappointed and you would have to agree. It was desperate defending in the end to hold on to the draw, but after having a 17-6 lead at the interval a near 10 minute spell of possession and territory when the scores were at 17 all the opportunity was there to claim victory. All in all it was another great game. That's it from me. Thanks for your emails. Bye.",

      "body": "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble.</strong> So for the second time in three weeks Ireland head to Paris in search of their second win in 40 years. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/11/six-nations-france-ireland-live\">The cancellation of the match 22 days ago</a> less than 10 minutes before kick off with the players waiting to come onto the pitch and 80,000 people in the ground was the sporting equivalent o9f being jilted at the altar. There was one positive for Declan Kidney's men: at least they got to return home without having lost. </p> <p><strong>The good news</strong> is that unless the players decide that their expensively coiffured hair can't handle a bit of rain then we will get a game today. In the meantime Ireland have beaten the Italians convincingly while France stuttered to victory at Murrayfield. Those performances have given Ireland more grounds for optimism than they had 22 days ago (when the crushing disappointment of the manner of defeat to Wales still lingered) and Kidney's strategy remained unaltered. </p> <p><strong>\"I think it's been more an outside view, than in the dressing room,\"</strong> he said of the statistic of one win in Paris in 40 years. \"They know it's in their hands. It's not a case of having to do anything different. But the French always lift their game at home. We need to concentrate and be physical for the full 80 minutes. When you have the ball, don't cough it up; when you don't have it, be rock solid in defence.\"</p> <p><strong>So that's it then.</strong> Concentrate. Be physical. And no coughing. The magic formula for victory in Paris. Kick off is 3pm (GMT). Here are the two line-ups ...</p> <p><strong>France:</strong> C Poitrenaud (Toulouse); V Clerc (Toulouse), A Rougerie (Clermont Auvergne), W Fofana (Clermont Auvergne), J Malzieu (Clermont Auvergne); F Trinh-Duc (Montpellier), M Parra (Clermont Auvergne); J-B Poux (Toulouse), D Szarzewski (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), N Mas (Perpignan), P Pap\u00e9 (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), Y Maestri (Toulouse), T Dusautoir (Toulouse, capt), J Bonnaire (Clermont Auvergne), I Harinordoquy (Biarritz).<br><strong>Replacements:</strong> W Servat (Toulouse), V Debaty (Clermont Auvergne), L Nallet (Racing M\u00e9tro), L Picamoles (Toulouse), J Dupuy (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), L Beauxis (Toulouse), M Mermoz (Perpignan).</p> <p><strong>Ireland:</strong> R Kearney (Leinster); T Bowe (Ospreys), K Earls (Munster), G D'Arcy (Leinster), A Trimble (Ulster); J Sexton (Leinster), C Murray (Munster); C Healy (Leinster), R Best (Ulster), M Ross (Leinster), D O'Callaghan (Munster), P O'Connell (Munster, capt), S Ferris (Ulster), S O'Brien (Leinster), J Heaslip (Leinster). <br><strong>Replacements:</strong> S Cronin (Leinster), T Court (Ulster), D Ryan (Munster), P O'Mahony (Munster), E Reddan (Leinster), R O'Gara (Munster), F McFadden (Leinster).</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Dave Pearson (Eng).</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>2.35pm: Ireland have loaned France some great men over the years - Joyce, Beckett, Cascarino. It's about time they started giving something back.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>2.42pm: Obviously the news that C<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/04/chelsea-andre-villas-boas\">helsea have parted company with Andr\u00e9 Villas Boas</a> puts this game <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUsWxOZolVQ\">into perspective</a> but we will battle on regardless.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>2.49pm: <strong>Breaking news ...</strong> Paul O'Connell doesn't want to get his head wet so the game is off.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>2.51pm: So there is now a raging selection debate about both the Ireland half-back positions. Murray and Sexton wear the No9 and 10 today with O'Gara and Reddan on the bench. Discuss. Or don't. The teams are on the pitch. Here come the anthems ...</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>2.56pm: Just one anthem for the Irish today - a jaunty version of Ireland's Call \u2013 will that halve their strength? Or maybe it will double it. Who knows? La Marseillaise is belted out in a stadium that's not quite full.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>Peeeep!!!!: Dave Pearson blows his whistle and Jonny Sexton gets the game underway with Ireland playing from left to right.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>1 min: Sexton puts an early up-and-under to test the France full back Poitrenaud who is not quite convincing under the high ball. Trinh-Duc then launches a high kick which Tommy Bowe deals with well.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>3 min: A dynamic break from the French, first through Poitrenaud whose break is brought to a halt by Murray. France work it to the right flank to Clerc who advances into the Ireland half but the Irish rearguard stays strong. France scrum.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>4 min: The France scrum is good but there's strong defence from Ireland as Sexton and Ferris snare Rougerie and keep him off the ground, turning it into a maul rather than a ruck, and eventually the scrum is given Ireland's way. Good defence. They may need it to stay at that level over the next 80 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>6 min: Penalty to Ireland after France lifted a man on the ground. It's central but close to halfway ...</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>7 min: ... Sexton misses the penalty. He pulls the kick to the left of the posts as he was faces them and it remains <strong>France 0-0 Ireland</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>10 min: A sloppy French scrum and Ireland turnover but are then penalised for not releasing on the ground and Trinh-Duc clears deep into he Irish 22. That's a real waste from Ireland. They did the hard work in turning over and now they're under real pressure.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>12 min: It's slightly rabid defence from Ireland but it's effective. They force Clerc backwards and then Kearney makes a perfect claim from a high kick. He kicks for touch and the pressure is relieved for the time being at least.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>12 min: <strong>TRY!!! France 0-5 IRELAND</strong>. It's the most simple try Tommy Bowe will ever score. He intercepted a telegraphed pass from Rougerie and ambled under the posts to touchdown.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>13 min: <strong>CONVERSION! France 0-7 IRELAND</strong>. Sexton makes no mistake from under the posts. Perfect start for Ireland.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>16 min: This is a really good display so far from Ireland. The defence has been strong and, though the try was a gift, they have been trying to get at France and expose their backline at every opportunity. \"Is it just me or has the quality of goal-kicking dropped markedly in the past few years?\" asks Niall Mullen. \"I've seen several of the worst penalty attempts I've ever seen in this year's 6 Nations. Mind you they were all from Italy.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>18 min: A story of the match in two kicks: Tommy Bowe picks up a French kick under no pressure at all. Poitrenaud is slammed by Kearney with two other green shirts lurking as he collects Bowe's return. It's a little too enthusiastic from Ireland - they're penalised - but still, France are far too lax.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>18 min: Ireland turn over again. It really is frenetic defensive display. They are dominant now and the French crowd are already on their team's backs. The next challenge for Kidney's side is to get their dominance reflected on the scoreboard. No problem.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>19 min: \"Just watching the rugby after completing a 26 venue A-Z pub crawl in Bristol yesterday,\" says Phillip Wainwright. \"Have you noticed the amount of time in this 6N that SH's are spending mincing about at the base of a ruck waiting for nothing in particular? Youngs (spectacularly so), Dickson and Parra have been guilty as far as I've seen but I'm sure Phillips et al have been equally culpable. Is there a rule about this? It's really annoying not to mention boring to watch. Rant over. Happy Sunday!\" More pressingly is it acceptable to have a half-pint on a pub crawl. I would think not.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>21 min: This is more like it from the French. there's some swift and clean passing with Trinh-Duc starting the move, and Ireland are penalised for an offside and Parra will have a shot at goal ...</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>22 min: <strong>PENALTY! FRANCE 3-7 Ireland</strong>. Parra makes no mistake from close range.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>25 min: Penalty to Ireland after a French forward failed to roll away from a ruck. Conor Murray threatens to take a tap kick but then sees sense and Sexton will kick at goal.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>26 min: <strong>PENALTY! France 3-10 IRELAND</strong>. Sexton has two from three as he slots this between the sticks. Ireland look a little laboured with the ball in their hands but if the French defensive indiscipline continues then they will have chances to keep the scoreboard ticking over.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>28 min: Very nearly another interception for Tommy Bowe. He goes at the loose pass one-handed but can't gather and knocks on. It's a strong scrum from the French and Ireland are penalised for wheeling the scrum. Parra will kick at goal from just inside the Irish half ...</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>3.32pm: <strong>PENALTY! FRANCE 6-10 Ireland</strong>. Parra's kick clips the bar and goers over and the flags are raised.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>31 min: From the restart France take possession and Trinh-Duc launches a kick downfield which pitches and runs and deceives Trimble and scuttles into touch inside the Ireland 22.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>32 min: This is great defence from Ireland and Sexton is particular. The 'choke and hold' is working a treat - as it did against Australia in the World Cup - and Ireland are awarded a scrum on halfway. RE: Scrum halves at the baser of rucks, Gareth Owen (more qualified as a ref than Brian Moore) writes: To answer your correspondant: there's no explicit Law, but refs are at liberty to decide that the ball is not going to emerge in a timely fashion and award a scrum to the last team moving forward. A quiet word to \"use it\" will usually suffice.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>34 min: Penalty for France but no yellow card as Cian Healy is waddling back from an offside position and trips over the ball. In the midst of that French move Bowe nearly made another interception.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>34 min: Parra misses the penalty. That's a let-off for Ireland. It stays <strong>France 6-10 Ireland</strong>. Unfortunately the picture I'm watching is reliant on a French director who thinks he's Francois Truffaut so apologies if the identity of certain players is mixed up. It's all upshots and moody lighting with this guy.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>37 min: <strong>TRY!!! France 6-15 IRELAND</strong>. What a brilliant try from Tommy Bowe. Earls handed off right on the touchline. From a French point of view he's got to be knocked into touch but Bowe ambled forwards, chipped over Malzieu, collected the pass, dummied and crossed for his second try of the game.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>39 min: <strong>CONVERSION!!</strong> Sexton's kick (just about) drifts over thanks to some late fade and it's <strong>France 6-17 Ireland</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>Half time: <strong>FRANCE 6-17 Ireland</strong>. Ireland have never led at half time in France. They've broken that record now. It's been a great performance so far, full of intensity and purpose. Can they keep it up? We shall see.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>Peeeep!!: The second half is underway. Can Ireland maintain the level of intensity, concentration and effort? Can France find any intensity, concentration and effort?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>42 min: Paul O'Connell is judged to have knocked on in a lineout and France have the put-in just outside the Irish 22. France are pushing now with Murray and Sexton excelling in defence. The fling the ball right to Rougerie but his pass to Poitrenaud is so so careless and the France No15 can't gather and knocks on. Big scrum for Ireland.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>45 min: It's a good scrum from Ireland but then D'Arcy nearly gets himself in trouble before Sexton's slightly sliced clearance finds touch.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>46 min: Penalty advantage to France as Mas tries to make ground. Rougerie then tries to break through midfield, is held up and there is no advantage so Parra will kick at goal ...</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>47 min: <strong>PENALTY! FRANCE 9-17 Ireland</strong>. Parra's left footed kick from 15m inside the left touchline (just) drifts between the sticks and the Ireland lead is now eight points.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p>49 min: It's a dangerous looking attack from Ireland as Trimble advances but Rougerie knocks the ball from his possession, Heaslip trips over it and Dave Pearson decides it's an Ireland knock on.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>50 min: <strong>TRY!!! FRANCE 14-17 Ireland</strong>. I have barely mentioned him today but Fofana is the France danger man and he has his third try in three games. It's sent upstairs for some reason - he was nowhere near touch and the ball was cleanly grounded - and unsurprisingly the try is awarded.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>51 min: The conversion is missed but the damage is done. I don't know what Ireland were playing at in midfield - there was a loose ball which Earls tried to kick ahead rather than drop on. He missed, it was popped into Fofana's hands and he raced clear.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>57 min: Rob Kearney very nearly gains ground on the right touchline but a flailing French hand taps his heels, trips him and he goes into touch. France forge forward and have a penalty. Parra will shoot for goal but it's a long way out. Ireland are being dominated now.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p>58 min: <strong>PENALTY! FRANCE 17-17 Ireland</strong>. Great kick from Parra. It slots right between the sticks and it's level but Ireland are flagging. Donnacha Ryan comes on for O'Callaghan. They desperately need some fresh impetus and aggression in the front eight.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>4.18pm: Conor Murray picks ups a bad looking knee injury. That's the end of his game (and possibly his Six Nations) and Eoin Reddan is on. This is set up for a French victory or Ronan O'Gara heroics. Vote now to decide.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p>62 min: There is a desperation to the Irish defending now which wasn't there in the first half when it was more an example of controlled aggression. It's still reasonably effective as Rory Best turns over. A typically defiant break from Kearney launches an Ireland attack, their first real foray forward this half.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p>64 min: Great passage of play from Ireland. Parra brings down Sexton. Ferris then makes a break, tries to keep the ball alive and the last touch is from a man in blue and Ireland have the lineout 10 metres from the French line.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p>65 min: Terrible lineout - it's over thrown by Best (not for the first time today) and O'Connell can't gather. France claim the ball, Trinh-Duc boots clear and Ireland make a flurry of changes including O'Mahony for Sean O'Brien.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p>66 min: Much better lineout throw from best and Trimble breaks the gain line. This is a good passage from Ireland and they've reversed the momentum of the opening 25 minutes of the half. They've yet to make it count on the scoreboard.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p>67 min: That's sloppy from D'Arcy - he lets the wet ball slip from his grasp - and Ireland lose the ball. That could be a big big moment. Nil points from that five minute period of dominance.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p>68 min: Ireland aren't ready to surrender the ball just yet. It's another wonderful take from the immense Kearney - that's his third outrageous catch of the game. This one was so much Harinordoquy's ball it may as well have been in his living room, but Kearney gathered and Ireland attack before Earls is knocked into touch.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p>71 min: Ireland have the ball but no momentum. Sexton chips into the 22 and Poitrenaud claims. takes his mark and clears to close to halfway. Picamoles comes on from France and O'Gara is on for Ireland, but for D'Arcy rather than Sexton. Ireland have the ball and need points. Three points, five points, seven points. Anything.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p>72 min: They're not going to get any of those as France clear into the Irish half. Can they succeed where Ireland failed and get points on the board? No is the answer as Beauxis tries a drop goal from a long way out but a three-;egged Jack Russell would get closer than that effort.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p>74 min: Ireland are penalised for handling in the ruck after O'Gara made a good break. That's sloppy and France can surge again with a lineout on the Ireland 22.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p>77 min: France are bashing down the Ireland door which is being held in place by O'Connell and Ferris. France set-up another drop goal attempt for Beauxis but Ferris is on him like a shot and charges it down.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p>78 min: Here come France again - they're on the Ireland 22. Ireland need to be disciplined here. They are. Ireland win a penalty as the French fail to release on the ground and O'Gara can clear to halfway. That's brilliant defending.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p>80 min: It's another unconvincing lineout but Ireland somehow retain the ball. At least they do until Heaslip loses it and France have the scrum just inside the Ireland half. One last final test of Ireland's defence and discipline. Time is up.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p>80 min: The scrum isn't binding as La Marseillaise is belted out by the crowd. France are too far out for a drop goal so will have to make considerable ground or hope for a penalty. France work the overlap on the left and Malzieu bursts for the line but more great (and desperate) Irish tackling forces him out of play and that is that ...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p>Full time: <strong>France 17-17 Ireland.</strong> After all that it's a draw. Maybe they could have just agreed that after the first game was called off? The real winners in this are Wales.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p>4.47pm: Paul O'Connell says Ireland are very disappointed and you would have to agree. It was desperate defending in the end to hold on to the draw, but after having a 17-6 lead at the interval a near 10 minute spell of possession and territory when the scores were at 17 all the opportunity was there to claim victory.

      "bodyText": "Prominent faith leaders have joined together to warn the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, that his legal aid bill will prevent domestic abuse victims from escaping violent partners. The sharply worded letter has been released as the House of Lords begins a series of crucial votes on Monday on government reforms aimed at saving \u00a3350m from the Ministry of Justice's annual legal aid budget. Criticism of the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders bill (Laspo) comes despite late concessions by the Ministry of Justice last week, ensuring that children who suffer brain damage at birth retain entitlement to legal aid. Another amendment expanded the definition of what constitutes domestic violence but campaign groups point out that the criteria used to assess eligibility remain unchanged. They allege it is too restrictive and will prevent vulnerable individuals from obtaining the legal support they need to leave violent partners. A survey by the Legal Action Group also published on Monday shows that more than 80% of those questioned believe there should be free legal advice for those with incomes below the national average, suggesting the government's determination to restrict legal aid may be out of step with public opinion. Defending the bill, Clarke said: \"Britain's legal aid bill is far greater than in other comparable nations. The government is clear that those most in need must be helped, where they face serious injustice. \"So our measures target legal aid at the people who will need legal support most, and at the most serious cases. Legal aid will continue to be available in many types of cases including where someone is at risk of serious violence or losing their liberty or their home, or where children may be taken into care. \"But we do not believe that people must have taxpayer-funded legal help for whatever they want, whenever they want. And it is not always in people's best interest to resort to the courts. There are often better ways to resolve disputes.\" The government is determined to avoid the embarrassing succession of defeats it suffered in the Lords over its health and welfare legislation. The Laspo bill has attracted less attention than other reforms but peers, including Thatcher-era Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, have put down scores of amendments. The letter to Clarke sounding the alarm about domestic abuse victims is signed by 10 leading clerics and heads of faith organisations, including the Catholic archbishop of Southwark, the Most Rev Peter Smith, the Anglican bishop of Leicester, the Rt Rev Timothy Stevens, and the heads of the Baptist Union, Methodist Conference, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Salvation Army, the Network of Sikh Organisations and others. The bishop of Leicester is the Church of England's lead in the Lords on welfare and constitutional issues. Their letter warns Clarke that \"legal aid is nothing short of essential for many victims of domestic abuse to escape the horrendous circumstances that they face. \"Without this support they would be unable to secure recourse in relation to fundamental issues such as injunctions, housing or access to children, potentially trapping them in a cycle of mistreatment and fear. \"Legal aid frequently allows for the resolution of domestic abuse cases before they escalate, in some cases avoiding serious injuries or even loss of life.\" The proposed list of \"objective evidence of domestic violence\", required to qualify for legal aid, appears restrictively narrow, the letter adds. \"Most worryingly, the fact that someone has used specialist domestic violence services, provided by voluntary agencies such as women's refuges, will not necessarily be accepted as evidence. \"This may leave many victims in dire need of support but without the 'right kind of evidence' to secure it, while others will be discouraged from pursuing legal solutions at all.\" The letter has been organised by the Caritas Social Action Network, which estimates that almost half of domestic abuse victims will no longer be able to access legal aid under the narrower criteria. The Ministry of Justice contends that legal aid will still be available to victims of domestic abuse as long as they meet at least one of various qualifications such as having a non-molestation order, occupation order, forced marriage protection order or other protective injunction either in place or made in the past twelve months. Having a partner with a criminal conviction for violence, active criminal proceedings for a domestic violence and other court findings will also guarantee access to legal aid. But Fiona Weir, the chief executive of Gingerbread, which helps single-parent families, warned: \"The majority of domestic violence victims will not be able to provide the evidence required to access legal aid. This will leave them and their children vulnerable to ongoing abuse and unsafe child contact arrangements.\" Ruth Bond, chair of the National Federation of Women's Institutes, said: \"As it stands this bill will only serve to punish those who have already suffered \u2026 victims of domestic abuse are still being asked to jump through varying hoops in an attempt to secure desperately needed financial support.\" The LAG survey, which questioned a sample of 1,000 people, found 82% of respondents supported free legal advice for those on below-average incomes. It also showed that those in the lowest social classes were the least likely to be willing to use the internet or telephone to obtain advice. Steve Hynes, the director of LAG, said: \"The message to the government is very clear from this opinion poll. People believe it is fair for the state to pay for advice on the everyday legal problems which life can throw at them. By proposing to cut much of civil legal aid, the government is in danger of completely ignoring the views of the public. \"We are calling on parliament to persuade the government to reverse its decision to withdraw civil legal aid for advice on the problems that many people are now facing due to the economic slowdown.\" Other areas where legal aid is being withdrawn include divorce and child custody cases, as well as those involving employment, immigration, housing, debt, benefit, education and most cases of medical negligence. Campaigners claim that access to justice will be severely restricted and become something only the wealthy can afford. Former Conservative cabinet ministers from the Thatcher era, including Lord Tebbit, have put down critical amendments rejecting such cuts in medical negligence cases. Plans in the bill to expand the use of telephone services to give legal advice, known as the telephone gateway, have provoked widespread concern. David Emmerson, chair of Resolution's legal aid committee, which represents family law practitioners, said: \"We are deeply concerned about the government's proposed single telephone gateway that will assess whether people will be able to access legal aid. Family law is complicated, and assessing someone's eligibility over the phone is simply inadequate. \"Research shows that social groups D and E are the least likely to access telephone advice, and many people who are eligible for legal aid are on low incomes \u2013 this inevitably deters them from paying for calls to helplines.\" The Ministry of Justice has not so far provided details of how any telephone gateway would work, whether calls would be free or to premium-rate numbers, the experience required to be a telephone adviser, how many staff might be employed and the overall cost of the scheme. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2012 as it incorrectly stated that David Emmerson was the chair of Resolution.",

They allege it is too restrictive and will prevent vulnerable individuals from obtaining the legal support they need to leave violent partners.</p> <p>A survey by the Legal Action Group also published on Monday shows that more than 80% of those questioned believe there should be free legal advice for those with incomes below the national average, suggesting the government's determination to restrict legal aid may be out of step with public opinion.</p> <p>Defending the bill, Clarke said: \"Britain's legal aid bill is far greater than in other comparable nations. The government is clear that those most in need must be helped, where they face serious injustice.</p> <p>\"So our measures target legal aid at the people who will need legal support most, and at the most serious cases. Legal aid will continue to be available in many types of cases including where someone is at risk of serious violence or losing their liberty or their home, or where children may be taken into care.</p> <p>\"But we do not believe that people must have taxpayer-funded legal help for whatever they want, whenever they want. And it is not always in people's best interest to resort to the courts. There are often better ways to resolve disputes.\"</p> <p>The government is determined to avoid the embarrassing succession of defeats it suffered in the Lords over its health and welfare legislation. The Laspo bill has attracted less attention than other reforms but peers, including Thatcher-era Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, have put down scores of amendments.</p> <p>The letter to Clarke sounding the alarm about domestic abuse victims is signed by 10 leading clerics and heads of faith organisations, including the Catholic archbishop of Southwark, the Most Rev Peter Smith, the Anglican bishop of Leicester, the Rt Rev Timothy Stevens, and the heads of the Baptist Union, Methodist Conference, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Salvation Army, the Network of Sikh Organisations and others. The bishop of Leicester is the Church of England's lead in the Lords on welfare and constitutional issues.</p> <p>Their letter warns Clarke that \"legal aid is nothing short of essential for many victims of domestic abuse to escape the horrendous circumstances that they face.</p> <p>\"Without this support they would be unable to secure recourse in relation to fundamental issues such as injunctions, housing or access to children, potentially trapping them in a cycle of mistreatment and fear.</p> <p>\"Legal aid frequently allows for the resolution of domestic abuse cases before they escalate, in some cases avoiding serious injuries or even loss of life.\"</p> <p>The proposed list of \"objective evidence of domestic violence\", required to qualify for legal aid, appears restrictively narrow, the letter adds. \"Most worryingly, the fact that someone has used specialist domestic violence services, provided by voluntary agencies such as women's refuges, will not necessarily be accepted as evidence.</p> <p>\"This may leave many victims in dire need of support but without the 'right kind of evidence' to secure it, while others will be discouraged from pursuing legal solutions at all.\"</p> <p>The letter has been organised by the Caritas Social Action Network, which estimates that almost half of domestic abuse victims will no longer be able to access legal aid under the narrower criteria.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice contends that legal aid will still be available to victims of domestic abuse as long as they meet at least one of various qualifications such as having a non-molestation order, occupation order, forced marriage protection order or other protective injunction either in place or made in the past twelve months.</p> <p>Having a partner with a criminal conviction for violence, active criminal proceedings for a domestic violence and other court findings will also guarantee access to legal aid.</p> <p>But Fiona Weir, the chief executive of Gingerbread, which helps single-parent families, warned: \"The majority of domestic violence victims will not be able to provide the evidence required to access legal aid. This will leave them and their children vulnerable to ongoing abuse and unsafe child contact arrangements.\"</p> <p>Ruth Bond, chair of the National Federation of Women's Institutes, said: \"As it stands this bill will only serve to punish those who have already suffered \u2026 victims of domestic abuse are still being asked to jump through varying hoops in an attempt to secure desperately needed financial support.\"</p> <p>The LAG survey, which questioned a sample of 1,000 people, found 82% of respondents supported free legal advice for those on below-average incomes. It also showed that those in the lowest social classes were the least likely to be willing to use the internet or telephone to obtain advice.</p> <p>Steve Hynes, the director of LAG, said: \"The message to the government is very clear from this opinion poll. People believe it is fair for the state to pay for advice on the everyday legal problems which life can throw at them. By proposing to cut much of civil legal aid, the government is in danger of completely ignoring the views of the public.</p> <p>\"We are calling on parliament to persuade the government to reverse its decision to withdraw civil legal aid for advice on the problems that many people are now facing due to the economic slowdown.\"</p> <p>Other areas where legal aid is being withdrawn include divorce and child custody cases, as well as those involving employment, immigration, housing, debt, benefit, education and most cases of medical negligence.</p> <p>Campaigners claim that access to justice will be severely restricted and become something only the wealthy can afford. Former Conservative cabinet ministers from the Thatcher era, including Lord Tebbit, have put down critical amendments rejecting such cuts in medical negligence cases.</p> <p>Plans in the bill to expand the use of telephone services to give legal advice, known as the telephone gateway, have provoked widespread concern.</p> <p>David Emmerson, chair of <a href=\"http://www.resolution.org.uk/\">Resolution</a>'s legal aid committee, which represents family law practitioners, said: \"We are deeply concerned about the government's proposed single telephone gateway that will assess whether people will be able to access legal aid. Family law is complicated, and assessing someone's eligibility over the phone is simply inadequate.</p> <p>\"Research shows that social groups D and E are the least likely to access telephone advice, and many people who are eligible for legal aid are on low incomes \u2013 this inevitably deters them from paying for calls to helplines.\"</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice has not so far provided details of how any telephone gateway would work, whether calls would be free or to premium-rate numbers, the experience required to be a telephone adviser, how many staff might be employed and the overall cost of the scheme.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2012 as it incorrectly stated that David Emmerson was the chair of Resolution. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Mitt Romney won the Republican caucuses in Washington state at the weekend to add to his lengthening list of victories before Super Tuesday, where he is likely to emerge as clear favourite to win the party's presidential nomination. Ten states hold votes on Tuesday, but a victory in the most important of them \u2013 Ohio \u2013 would in effect put an end to the challenge from Romney's nearest rival, Rick Santorum. \"If Romney beats Santorum, it is the beginning of the end not just for Santorum but the dreams of all those who wanted to deny Romney the nomination,\" said Larry Sabato, professor of politics at the University of Virginia. Polls suggest that Romney, Santorum and Newt Gingrich could all pick up states on Super Tuesday. Romney is on course to win Massachusetts, Virginia, Vermont and Idaho, Santorum to win Tennessee and Oklahoma, and Gingrich to win Georgia. But Ohio would be the decider. Although Santorum enjoyed a big lead over Romney in Ohio just a few days ago, that has since shrunk and polls show the two in a dead heat. If Santorum were to win Ohio, it would reignite the fierce debate about Romney's suitability as a credible challenger to Barack Obama and the contest could drag on until the last state, Utah, on 26 June. Obama would be the main beneficiary of such a drawn-out affair, given the extent to which Republicans are mauling one another and spending cash that could have been saved for the presidential election. Tom Mann, a politics specialist at the Brookings Institution, dismissed Romney's rivals. \"The others are a joke. Super Tuesday will shed light on how long the battle will drag on and when Romney wins a majority of delegates,\" he said. But he warned that Romney had himself been undermined by the fiercely contested nomination race. \"The presumptive nominee has weak support with his party base and has been diminished as a serious candidate to win independents and disaffected Democrats. Not a pretty picture for the GOP.\" Romney won Washington state with 38%, with Ron Paul on 25%, Santorum 24% and Gingrich 10%. Romney won 30 of the state's delegates, and Santorum and Paul took five each. To secure the Republican nomination, a candidate has to win the backing of at least 1,144 delegates to the party's convention in Tampa, Florida, in August. So far, Romney has accumulated 203 delegates, Santorum 92, Gingrich 33 and Paul 25. On Super Tuesday, 419 delegates will be at stake. With Washington, Romney has won eight of the 13 states contested so far, Santorum four and Gingrich one. Romney, Santorum and Gingrich were all campaigning in Ohio over the weekend while Paul alone was in Washington state, still hoping for his first win. Having failed in Michigan last week with a socially conservative message, Santorum has switched to an economic one in Ohio, trying to win over manufacturing and coalmining communities, as well as Christian evangelicals. But he was having mixed success. In Cambridge, a typical south-east Ohio town in the foothills of the Appalachian mountains, Joan Boy, who runs the Attic Trunk furniture business, is backing Santorum. \"I want someone in our presidency where there's no question about his beliefs. Mitt is a Mormon and Mormons do not believe that Jesus is the son of God. So to vote for Mitt Romney we'd be having about the same as we have now,\" he said. But Bernie Schreiner, a retired 70-year-old, said he would not be voting for Santorum, viewing electability as the priority. \"I think he's a well-qualified person, but he's not electable,\" said Schreiner. \"Mitt Romney is the guy who's most electable. I like [Santorum] a lot but you have to nominate someone who is electable.\" Such sentiments were echoed time and again in the area \u2013 Christian voters drawn to Santorum, people less concerned with faith unconvinced by his ability to beat Obama. In east Tennessee, an area that has consistently voted Republican since the civil war, Santorum is expected to excel on Tuesday. Among those hoping for a Santorum candidacy were Gary Roberts, a 53-year-old general contractor from Knoxville. \"He has more conservative values that go along with mine,\" he said. \"There's more of the south in those.\" Merle Black, a professor at Emory University, said: \"The key state is Ohio. If Santorum is successful, then doubts about Romney will continue to escalate. If Romney wins Ohio, Santorum will be in a real uphill battle the rest of the way.\"",

Romney is on course to win Massachusetts, Virginia, Vermont and Idaho, Santorum to win Tennessee and Oklahoma, and Gingrich to win Georgia.</p> <p>But Ohio would be the decider. Although Santorum enjoyed a big lead over Romney in Ohio just a few days ago, that has since shrunk and polls show the two in a dead heat. If Santorum were to win Ohio, it would reignite the fierce debate about Romney's suitability as a credible challenger to Barack Obama and the contest could drag on until the last state, Utah, on 26 June.</p> <p>Obama would be the main beneficiary of such a drawn-out affair, given the extent to which Republicans are mauling one another and spending cash that could have been saved for the presidential election.</p> <p>Tom Mann, a politics specialist at the Brookings Institution, dismissed Romney's rivals. \"The others are a joke. Super Tuesday will shed light on how long the battle will drag on and when Romney wins a majority of delegates,\" he said.</p> <p>But he warned that Romney had himself been undermined by the fiercely contested nomination race.</p> <p>\"The presumptive nominee has weak support with his party base and has been diminished as a serious candidate to win independents and disaffected Democrats. Not a pretty picture for the GOP.\"</p> <p>Romney won Washington state with 38%, with Ron Paul on 25%, Santorum 24% and Gingrich 10%. Romney won 30 of the state's delegates, and Santorum and Paul took five each.</p> <p>To secure the Republican nomination, a candidate has to win the backing of at least 1,144 delegates to the party's convention in Tampa, Florida, in August.</p> <p>So far, Romney has accumulated 203 delegates, Santorum 92, Gingrich 33 and Paul 25. On Super Tuesday, 419 delegates will be at stake.</p> <p>With Washington, Romney has won eight of the 13 states contested so far, Santorum four and Gingrich one.

      "bodyText": "When the government came to power, the Home Office made two decisions that explain the \"privatisation\" agenda for policing that was revealed in Saturday's Guardian. The first, a mistake in the face of looming cuts \u2013 20%, more than almost any other service \u2013 was to ask Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to determine which police officer jobs could be classified as back- and middle-office tasks so as to protect frontline services. That rather pointless inquiry, which inevitably found most of the jobs could not be separated by that terminology, has delayed the impact of the second and much more important decision: that the political shibboleth of officer numbers would be abandoned and police numbers would be allowed to fall. That is what lies behind the tenders put out by West Midlands and Surrey police forces, central to the claim that the police are being privatised. Once the straitjacket of officer numbers is removed, police forces can modernise their budgets in the way any other institution would do, namely by reducing unit costs. The correct question that should have been asked by the Home Office is, which functions currently carried out by sworn, fully warranted, fully trained police officers do not need to be? On this, swaths of police tasks, such as guarding prisoners in custody, searching woodlands, preparing routine witness statements and providing intelligence analysis to murder inquiries, swing into view. Many forces have employed their own non-police staff to undertake this sort of task but have been unable to do so in sufficient numbers because of the need to employ a fixed and ever increasing number of officers within a set budget. The tender offered by West Midlands and Surrey police signals a shift that would allow the private sector to provide staff who can carry out routine and repetitive tasks at cheaper rates and, perhaps most intriguingly, to provide temporary access to skilled staff \u2013 such as murder inquiry teams \u2013 which can be hired for incidents that are rare in most forces but for which all forces must permanently retain a group of very expensive staff. This would then allow the chief constable, satisfied that he or she has commissioned these kind of services at a cheaper rate, to spend more of the budget on those parts of the service that require, because of their complexity, their impact on public safety or their centrality to the police mission, to be carried out by fully warranted officers. As examples, while some of the routine enquiries and tasks in a murder investigation can be done by others, the inquiry itself must be led by fully trained and warranted detectives; all armed staff must be under the direct employ of the chief constable; and, if it was me, I would not allow any patrolling to be done by anyone other than a direct employee. Even here, however, unit costs can be reduced by employing in-house staff who are trained only for specific roles. Police community support officers point the way forward here. There are two important caveats. First, there is a limit: there should be a minimum but sizable number of fully warranted officers who give each force the flexibility to respond to major, unexpected emergencies. Second, outsourced services must still form part of the chief constable's public accountabilities. However, at long last, the opportunities for the modernisation of policing within a public sector ethos are suddenly apparent. It is not a shock, horror idea. I just hope that the incoming elected commissioners will not close it down by campaigning on the tired slogan of raising officer numbers rather than improving results. As the tenders have just been released by two soon-to-be abolished police authorities, that would be an irony.",

      "bodyText": "British pension funds aim to launch a multibillion-pound infrastructure fund next year that will invest up to \u00a34bn in government projects from roads and high-speed rail lines to power stations. The Pension Protection Fund and the National Association of Pension Funds are in discussions with 20 others to create a vehicle that will consider investing in the projects outlined by the chancellor, George Osborne, in last year's national infrastructure plan. That shortlist will be whittled down to between 10 and 12 contributors, who are expected to put in starter capital \u2013 to fund staff hires \u2013 and a further cash injection to launch the investment fund. The NAPF and PPF are aiming to raise between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn in an initial fundraising drive that could rise to between \u00a33bn and \u00a34bn with leverage, as they target a launch date of January 2013. Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the PPF, said: \"Our focus is building a core of something like 10 to 12 funds who will put up development capital to take us forward to formal launch in January 2013. We are making good progress.\" Rubenstein expects the founder funds to contribute about \u00a31bn, with a further \u00a31bn raised by subscriptions from other investors. The fund could follow the example of Australia's Industry Funds Management, an investment vehicle whose infrastructure interests, which include Anglian Water in the UK, are worth A$10bn (\u00a36.8bn). The PPF envisages that the fund will be a not-for-profit entity, with any surplus reinvested in further projects, although initial earnings will be used to pay off the startup capital and loans. \"One thing pension funds have told us is they don't like unnecessarily costly fee structures, so we are looking to set the platform up as a not-for-profit vehicle,\" said Rubenstein. Another model the fund could follow is Borealis in Canada, which takes a significant stake in deals and is co-owner of a 30-year concession to operate the High Speed One rail line between London and the Channel Tunnel. It is understood that the NAPF and PPF have not ruled out sharing management of the fund with a leading infrastructure investor. The PPF's bullishness is in contrast to scepticism over whether the government will be able to secure the \u00a320bn in investment it is seeking from pension funds and the insurance community. KPMG warned last week that British funds do not have the skill set to invest in infrastructure, while new solvency regulations for insurers could impede putting such projects on their balance sheets. The infrastructure fund is the product of a memorandum of understanding signed by the NAPF and PPF with the government last November, in which the groups pledged to develop an investment vehicle for big projects. According to the national infrastructure plan published in Osborne's autumn statement last year, the government needs \u00a3200bn of investment in transport, power and telecoms projects over the next five years and the majority of the funding will come from the private sector. The PPF has about \u00a310bn under management and was launched in 2005 to run the pension assets and liabilities of companies that have folded with underfunded defined-benefit schemes, covering about 12 million members. The NAPF represents 1,200 pension funds who hold assets worth \u00a3800bn. Investors are believed to be mulling some outstanding issues with the fund, such as insuring against the construction risk inherent in new-build or \"greenfield\" projects, from high-speed rail lines to power stations. Investors are traditionally nervous of underwriting construction projects that could, for a variety of reasons, run over budget or suffer from serious technical problems once launched. Investors are discussing whether the government can provide a guarantee for construction risk or whether state-controlled banks could get involved, possibly through issuing convertible bonds that transform into equity upon completion of the project.",

      "bodyText": "In one small, sunny corner of south-east England, many miles from the congested M4 corridor, is a sight to make the owners of Heathrow weep with envy. Under the benevolent gaze of local parishioners, construction workers finish surfacing a brand-new runway, and \u2013 even as it lops off the corner of his churchyard \u2013 the vicar is going along to the opening celebrations. Welcome to the ambitiously named London Southend airport, officially reopening on Monday, with a runway now large enough for easyJet's planes, and set to export the holidaymakers of south Essex and to lure unwary Spanish visitors. Given the opposition airport expansion has faced elsewhere, many in Southend on Sea are astonishingly serene about the development on their doorsteps. A new terminal building gleams proudly opposite the bungalows of Southend Road, close enough for residents to peer from behind the net curtains into departures. The transformation is clear from the green expanses still displayed on Google Earth. As Alastair Welch, the beaming director, put it: \"You start with a field, then add a railway station, a terminal building, train up a crew and then the planes start coming. Happy days!\" Perhaps even more surprising than its renaissance is the airport's claim to have once been Britain's third largest, before BAA built Stansted and grabbed all its business. Path\u00e9 footage records Southend's glamour days, when passengers could take their cars to the continent aboard British Air Ferries planes. After decades in the doldrums, with nothing more than a flying club, the odd cargo flight and aircraft coming in for repair, the airport was purchased by the firm of the legendary lorry magnate Eddie Stobart. Welch joined in 2007 with a vision to extend the runway to cope with the demands of flights to the Mediterranean. An investment of \u00a3100m has brought a control tower, (\"You couldn't actually see the runway from the old one,\" said Welch), a distinctive steel railway station (a \u00a32.70, five-minute journey from the town centre) and a Holiday Inn under construction \u2013 the basic infrastructure for Stobart Air to have a fully-fledged international passenger airport on its hands. From 2 April, easyJet starts flying from here to destinations including Malaga, Ibiza and Mallorca, routes to excite the Towie stars who graced the airport's launch party, where the leader of the council spoke of bringing \"jetsetters\" from Spain to Southend. Visitors may have reason to be tempted: a 52-minute ride to Liverpool Street station makes its rail connection to the capital roughly equivalent to Stansted's, but cheaper, and on a line that stops at Stratford for the Olympic Park. The first arrival to reach the new terminal landed shortly after 2pm on its first day of operation this week, an Aer Arran propeller-engined aircraft from Waterford. First off was Michelle Hill, 37, from nearby Benfleet, a competition winner who had departed via the old, fading wooden terminal hut to return to Southend's bright future. \"Really nice,\" she said. \"Most people are into it \u2013 it's creating jobs, bringing tourism.\" Did she think they would really be heading here from Spain? \"Yeah, why not? We've got a lot to offer: doorstep to London, the town centre, a beach, the pier.\" Although, she conceded, the pier has been closed since a fishing trawler crashed into it last month. Only 10 passengers had yet troubled the check-in attendant, who sat waiting for standby passengers on the day's only departure, back to Waterford. A well-heeled Irish couple eventually ran through, boarding with just 15 minutes to spare. They had been on holiday in London \u2013 and this was a lot easier to deal with than Heathrow, the woman explained. Although its limited destinations don't yet allow duty-free, the manager of the airport store \u2013 stocking Eddie Stobart memorabilia alongside obligatory Toblerones \u2013 said they had were already exceeding sales targets. According to Welch, there will be 500 more people working at the airport this summer than last. The old terminal, a hundred yards or so away, is still open to the public with a dozen or so people, mainly pensioners, congregating inside. \"They like to wander in and have a bite to eat, so we'll just leave it open, as long as they want it,\" said Welch. \"It's a community facility.\" Not everybody is convinced, though. Denis Walker is spokesman for Stop Airport Extension Now, a local group. While his opposition is partly environmental, as a member of Friends of the Earth, he believes the council has failed in its duty to warn the people of Southend of the extra noise and pollution. \"It's a really stupid place for an airport,\" he says. \"There will be 20,000 people directly under the flight path.\" Despite a tortuous process of consultations, planning appeals and aborted judicial reviews, he says there has never been the full public inquiry and independent scrutiny a development such as this deserves. Southend will have 20-30 passenger daily flights this year, but Stobart hopes to eventually carry up to 2 million passengers annually and plans to extend the terminal further this summer. But opposition has been limited, and the church was the key, Welch said, to winning over locals: something that previous would-be expansionists failed to factor in. At St Laurence's, a former churchwarden, who gave her name only as Beryl, recalled: \"When they sat in the chancel in 2003 and said this church has to go, hackles did rise.\" The eventual compromise has been one demolished wall and a lost row of trees; Stobart has stumped up for a new road, a low yew hedge and a \"much nicer\" driveway with a turning circle big enough for hearses. \"It is nicer,\" Beryl agreed. Looking over the new wire fence separating the graves from the runway, she added: \"They'll get over the trees.\"",

We've got a lot to offer: doorstep to London, the town centre, a beach, the pier.\" Although, she conceded, the pier has been closed since a fishing trawler crashed into it last month.</p> <p>Only 10 passengers had yet troubled the check-in attendant, who sat waiting for standby passengers on the day's only departure, back to Waterford. A well-heeled Irish couple eventually ran through, boarding with just 15 minutes to spare. They had been on holiday in London \u2013 and this was a lot easier to deal with than Heathrow, the woman explained.</p> <p>Although its limited destinations don't yet allow duty-free, the manager of the airport store \u2013 stocking Eddie Stobart memorabilia alongside obligatory Toblerones \u2013 said they had were already exceeding sales targets.</p> <p>According to Welch, there will be 500 more people working at the airport this summer than last. The old terminal, a hundred yards or so away, is still open to the public with a dozen or so people, mainly pensioners, congregating inside. \"They like to wander in and have a bite to eat, so we'll just leave it open, as long as they want it,\" said Welch. \"It's a community facility.\"</p> <p>Not everybody is convinced, though. Denis Walker is spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.saen.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Stop Airport Extension Now</a>, a local group. While his opposition is partly environmental, as a member of Friends of the Earth, he believes the council has failed in its duty to warn the people of Southend of the extra noise and pollution. \"It's a really stupid place for an airport,\" he says. \"There will be 20,000 people directly under the flight path.\"</p> <p>Despite a tortuous process of consultations, planning appeals and aborted judicial reviews, he says there has never been the full public inquiry and independent scrutiny a development such as this deserves. Southend will have 20-30 passenger daily flights this year, but Stobart hopes to eventually carry up to 2 million passengers annually and plans to extend the terminal further this summer.</p> <p>But opposition has been limited, and the church was the key, Welch said, to winning over locals: something that previous would-be expansionists failed to factor in. At St Laurence's, a former churchwarden, who gave her name only as Beryl, recalled: \"When they sat in the chancel in 2003 and said this church has to go, hackles did rise.\"</p> <p>The eventual compromise has been one demolished wall and a lost row of trees; Stobart has stumped up for a new road, a low yew hedge and a \"much nicer\" driveway with a turning circle big enough for hearses. \"It is nicer,\" Beryl agreed. Looking over the new wire fence separating the graves from the runway, she added: \"They'll get over the trees.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The very powerful can afford to speak quietly in a crowded room, knowing full well that the audience will hush and strain to hear what they have to say. It is an impressive way to demonstrate strength, and \u2013 crucially at Paris fashion week \u2013 an elegant one. Celine, the French label headed by the British designer Phoebe Philo, has taken this approach. Instead of a catwalk show catering for hundreds of writers, photographers and bloggers, the house presented Philo's latest collection at home in the label's Paris showroom to a total of 70 guests, split between two shows. Only in-house photographers were invited, with guests instructed not to share their own photos on social media. This was not a retreat from Celine's presence in the contemporary fashion conversation, but the opposite \u2013 a flexing of fashion muscle which underlined the power Celine now has. While most brands attempt to ride the economic storm by reaching out to a broader audience via livestreamed catwalk shows and high street collaborations, Celine is confident that its signature form of minimal chic will continue to draw women without it having to shout to be heard. The simple explanation for Celine's downscaled presence was very much in evidence as Philo welcomed guests to her show wearing a navy polo neck sweater stretched tight over her eight-month pregnant form. Philo, who was unwilling to orchestrate and present a largescale show at this late stage in her pregnancy, has never shied away from prioritising her family life. While at Chloe, she was the first designer of a major house to take maternity leave, and subsequently took a sabbatical of nearly three years when her second child was born. \"Those three years were about getting the fundamentals of my life set up,\" she has said since. While the catalyst for Celine's ultra-exclusive show was simple biology, it comes at an interesting point for a Paris fashion week in a state of flux. Both Dior and Yves Saint Laurent are currently without figurehead designers. The John Galliano affair highlighted the way in which designers have become commodified by a luxury industry which valued the personality more than the person. LVMH, which owns both Dior and Celine, now seems at pains to display a more humane side, with executives at the presentation keen to show full and smiling support of Philo's choice. The small-scale presentation emphasised the power of a collection which was more punchy than in previous seasons. The soundtrack was the 1995 Portishead classic Glory Box, and the clothes were Celine with the volume turned up. The show opened with a round-shouldered, textured cream coat with no visible fastenings, the back view finished with a black leather strap buttoned across the hips. Cricket sweaters, a Celine classic, were revisited with a new softness and volume. A black leather dress with snaking zips brought a new upfront sensuality. Trousers, a Philo trademark, came in 7/8 or floorlength, slender or wide, some with the go-faster stripes that have become a Celine motif and some in a marl-effect wool with sweatpant patch pockets. The collage of photographs which Philo leaves on each seat at her shows featured Mayan fertility statues juxtaposed with similarly cartoonish proportioned glamour models. Philo, who often offers \"reduced\" as the highest of aesthetic compliment, was less pared down this season. A bright pink fur coat, asymmetric colour blocking and a sweatshirt patchworked from neoprene and suede were all new territory for the erstwhile queen of minimal. But subtlety is a house code at Celine, and no message is ever as simple as it looks. Even the message of Philo's family-oriented career is more complicated than it first appears. It has become popular to ascribe Celine's success to Philo's affinity with the busy modern working mother. But cool, private Philo sells an image that is far removed from that of the busy everywoman juggling kids and career. The Celine aesthetic is not about multitasking, but rather about compartmentalisation and focus. Her uncompromising stance on maternity leave emphasises a belief in doing one thing at a time, and doing it brilliantly. This purity of focus in the workplace is still to a large extent a luxury enjoyed by men, while women concede head space to the domestic. The clothes are imbued with a streamlined energy which women crave, and so in a messy, compromised reality they represent a fantasy lifestyle. And that has always been what it takes to stand out at Paris fashion week.",

The burglar sneaked into Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin on Friday night and ignored valuable gold chalices and candlesticks, choosing instead to take the preserved heart of Laurence O'Toole, the city's 12th-century patron saint. A cathedral spokesman said the thief would have needed a metal cutter to remove the heart, which was kept in a wooden reliquary inside a box with iron bars. No alarm was triggered and there was no sign of a break-in, said the spokesman, adding that three valuable gold chalices and gold candlesticks in the chapel were not stolen. \"It's completely bizarre. They didn't touch anything else. They specifically targeted this, they wanted the heart of St Laurence O'Toole,\" the spokesman said. The dean of the cathedral, the Most Rev Dermot Dunne, said he was devastated by the theft. \"It has no economic value but it is a priceless treasure that links our present foundation with its founding father, St Laurence O'Toole,\" he said. Gardai are studying CCTV footage of people entering the cathedral and detectives are investigating the theory that thieves may have hidden themselves inside overnight before breaking into the iron box once the building was closed to the public. O'Toole was born in Co Kildare in 1128 and became an ascetic who wore a hairshirt, never ate meat and fasted every day. He also lived in a cave near Glendalough in Co Wicklow. In 1162 he was elected archbishop of Dublin and was canonised by Pope Honorius III in 1225. His heart has been preserved in the cathedral since the 13th century. Since last autumn four ancient holy relics have been stolen from churches in Dublin and Tipperary.",

Kevin Nolan, outstanding in midfield, and George McCartney were the scorers in a deserved win which leaves the Welsh team outside the play-off places, in eighth, with just four points from their last six games. Nolan, West Ham's captain, said: \"We don't just want promotion, we want to go up as champions.\" Sam Allardyce, who had taken his players to Dubai for a week rest and recuperation,said the contrast in the teams' preparations was significant. \"It couldn't have been more different,\" he said. \"The momentum Cardiff were looking for wasn't there because of their extra-time exertions at Wembley.

Kenny Miller also rapped the woodwork with a header in the dying seconds, but by then the match had been won and lost.

Malky Mackay, the manager, explained that the limitations of a small squad precluded him from rotating his starting 11.

      "bodyText": "Grace under pressure was conspicuous by its absence during an afternoon featuring two red cards \u2013 one shown to Sunderland's Lee Cattermole for foul and abusive language after the final whistle \u2013 eight bookings and a managerial slanging match. Fortunately for Alan Pardew, who got involved in an unseemly second-half touchline spat with Martin O'Neill, Shola Ameobi proved one of the few participants to keep his cool. \"That's why I love Shola to bits,\" said Pardew after watching the striker outwit his fellow substitute Wayne Bridge before scoring a stoppage-time equaliser. Earlier Nicklas Bendtner had given an initially superior Sunderland a first-half lead from the penalty spot, Andy Woodman, Newcastle United's goalkeeping coach had been ordered to the stands, St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon was sent off for elbowing Cheik Tiot\u00e9 in the throat and Demba Ba missed a penalty. In between all this testosterone-fuelled aggro St James' Park was treated to a brilliant second-half performance from the home substitute Hatem Ben Arfa whose arrival on the right wing altered the afternoon's power balance and some outstandingly defiant defending from the Sunderland centre-half Michael Turner. The general tone was set after 45 seconds. Cattermole's ghastly late, two-footed tackle on Tiot\u00e9 left Newcastle's Ivorian enforcer in a crumpled heap and a yellow card flashing before the Sunderland captain's eyes. A little later Tiot\u00e9 looked fortunate to go unpunished after appearing to stamp on Cattermole's ankle. Such cameos proved entirely emblematic of an encounter further enlivened by the moment when James McClean's reckless late challenge on Danny Simpson \u2013 \"he's got to go,\" exclaimed Pardew \u2013 resulted in the winger and the full-back literally touching foreheads before Tim Krul's intervention. With numerous players bundling in, anarchy beckoned but, eventually, Mike Dean restored order, booking both protagonists. At this stage there had been more cards than shots on target. Things changed when Sunderland deservedly won a penalty after Mike Willamson tugged Turner's shirt so hard he hauled the Sunderland centre-half over in the box and Bendtner directed a superbly executed kick into the bottom corner. Warming up, Fraizer Campbell celebrated wildly, and surely unwisely, in front of enraged home fans. While Krul subsequently performed wonders to repel Bendtner's fine half-volley, Sess\u00e8gnon could not quite dispatch Sebastian Larsson's excellent low cross beyond Newcastle's Dutch goalkeeper. Sucked into something approaching physical warfare and very much second best to Sunderland on the ball, Pardew's team were firmly on the back foot but, finally, they forced Simon Mignolet into a decent save, the visiting goalkeeper doing well to keep out Fabricio Coloccini's header from Ryan Taylor's corner. From a subsequent corner Demba Ba hit the bar and he later appealed, forlornly, for a penalty after being brought down by John O'Shea, who appeared to have won the ball. Even so Newcastle desperately required a change of pace and Pardew introduced it after half-time in Ben Arfa. Much improved, Newcastle began enjoying increased possession but were very nearly caught out on the counterattack. Indeed it took a brilliant double save from Krul to prevent Larsson and then McClean from doubling Sunderland's lead. Everything changed when Sess\u00e8gnon was then sent off for elbowing Tiot\u00e9. If the forward could have no complaints when he saw red, the Ivorian's am-dram collapse followed by a good few minutes spent writhing in apparent agony rather over-egged things \u2013 even if the cheeky pat on Tiot\u00e9's cheek swiftly proferred by his manager suggested Pardew quietly approved. Terrorised by Ben Arfa, \u2013 who drew an inspired save from Mignolet \u2013 Sunderland were suddenly defending for their lives, surviving assorted penalty appeals along the way. One involved Ben Arfa tumbling in the face of fleeting contact with McClean but the referee adjudged the Frenchman to have dived. Immediately Pardew and O'Neill exchanged harsh words. Then, when Newcastle finally won a penalty following Campbell's wild challenge on Ameobi, Pardew and O'Neill required separation after squaring up. Ba stepped forward but seemed to change his mind during the run-up before Mignolet saved his kick. As the clock ticked remorselessly perhaps Pardew's only consolation was Ameobi's extraordinary scoring record against Sunderland. Sure enough he enhanced that impressive Tyne-Wear tally when Williamson flicked on Yohan Cabaye's stoppage-time left-wing cross. Dodging Bridge, Ameobi half-volleyed his seventh such derby goal \u2013 a record bettered only by Jackie Milburn \u2013 through Mignolet's legs. Momentarily, it seemed that the attritional drama would be replaced by hugs and handshakes but instead Cattermole's expletive-laden rant at the referee prefaced O'Neill bodyswerving post-match drinks with Pardew.",

The manager claims he retains the hierarchy's support in the aftermath. \"The owner didn't pay 15m [euros in compensation] to get me out of Porto only to pay me another fortune just to let me go again,\" says Villas-Boas. 12 February 2012 \u2013 The fallout from Everton 2-0 Chelsea An anaemic performance on Merseyside prompts Villas-Boas to call in his squad on their day off, with emotions boiling over in the team meeting. Some senior players, most notably Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard, respond by telling him exactly what they think of his tactics. Abramovich is also present at the training ground that day and, while the manager subsequently admits some of his squad are not buying into his ideas, he reiterates that he enjoys the owner's support. 21 February 2012 \u2013 Napoli 3-1 Chelsea Chelsea are undone at the Stadio San Paolo despite taking a first-half lead, with the decision to leave Lampard, Michael Essien and Cole on the bench at the start, prompting the technical director, Michael Emenalo, to seek an explanation of the team selection on behalf of the owner. \"[Abramovich] just wanted to know the thought process,\" explains Villas-Boas. At the time, the bold selection has the feel of a suicide note. 27 February 2012 \u2013 Interview with Portuguese radio A lengthy interview, conducted the previous Thursday, is broadcast on the Portuguese radio station TSF in which Villas-Boas admits for the first time that he fears he may suffer the same fate as Luiz Felipe Scolari and Carlo Ancelotti. There is an unhelpful comparison of Fernando Torres's impact with that of Mateja Kezman and Andriy Shevchenko, with the comments unappreciated by the club's hierarchy. 2 March 2012 \u2013 Brutally honest press conference Again, Villas-Boas is a victim of his own honesty. A public admission that Chelsea's squad bears no comparison with that of Manchester City, despite Abramovich's \u00a31bn investment in the club, is politically perilous and hardly a fillip for the players he is preparing to send out against West Bromwich Albion. The game is duly lost to leave the Londoners three points behind Arsenal in fifth place.",

      "bodyText": "Preamble Morning. The Respect Campaign may be a lamentable sham, but there's one thing in English football that does deserve a little R.E.S.P.E.C.T: the Tyne-Wear derby. This match is HUGE \u2013 huge enough to have capital letters and be bolded up, even on a Sunday \u2013 yet it's rarely mentioned in the same breath as the Manchester, Merseyside, Glasgow and north London derbies. There's certainly an element of geographical snobbery in that, though it might also be because this hasn't been a regular fixture. Today is only the 38th match between the sides since 1970. It's hard to remember the last time Newcastle and Sunderland met with both sides in such rude health. Newcastle are still in the race for a Champions League place \u2013 which, on a pound-for-pound basis, would perhaps be their greatest achievement of the last few decades \u2013 while Sunderland have been reborn under the magnificent Martin O'Neill. Sunderland were thrashed 5-1 at Mike Ashley Field last season, and haven't won there for 12 years. If they do so today, the collective man-love for O'Neill in the SR postal district will be off the scale. Kick off is at midday. Team news Sunderland are playing two up front, which is a bit of a surprise \u2013 especially as the additional striker is Nicklas Bendtner rather than England's Fraizer Campbell. Jack Colback drops out. That's Sunderland's only change from last weekend's defeat by West Brom; the excellent Stephane Sessegnon starts despite a delay on his journey back from Benin's midweek match in Ethopia. Newcastle are unchanged. Newcastle (4-4-2) Krul; Simpson, Williamson, Coloccini, Santon; Ryan Taylor, Cabaye, Tiote, Gutierrez; Ba, Cisse. Subs: Elliot, Guthrie, Ben Arfa, Lovenkrands, Shola Ameobi, Obertan, Perch. Sunderland (4-4-2) Mignolet; Bardsley, O'Shea, Turner, Richardson; Larsson, Cattermole, Gardner, McClean; Sessegnon, Bendtner. Subs: Gordon, Bridge, Campbell, Kilgallon, Colback, Vaughan, Meyler. Referee Mike Dean (Wirral) Previously on Newcastle v Sunderland ... This fixture has produced some memorable moments down the years: Howard Gayle and particularly Gary Bennett losing it after incessant racist abuse in 1985; Paul Hardyman almost booting John Burridge's head off; the Gates/Gabbiadini show in the play-off semi-final of 1990; the sky falling in on Ruud Gullit in 1999; Niall Quinn's majestic winner the following year; and Kevin Nolan's hat-trick in last season's thrashing. 11.43am \"For intensity, this makes El Clasico look like a reserve game,\" says Chas Marshall. \"Newcastle have surprised me this year, I fancied them to struggle. But even the most one-eyed Mackem has to concede that Pardew has done unexpectedly well. I think we'll beat them today, though, noisily and with relish.\" 11.58am \"I love the summariser's calm description description of Bennett's 'reckless challenge' in that clip,\" says David Thompson. \"How would the media react to such a challenge today?\" It really doesn't bear thinking about. Non-surprise of the day The atmosphere at Mike Ashley Field is magnificent. 1 min Sunderland kick off from left to right. Eventually: they didn't hear Mike Dean's whistle the first time, such is the wall of noise. Sunderland are in red-and-white stripes; Newcastle are in black-and-white stripes. 33 seconds Non-surprise of the day (2): Lee Cattermole is booked for a ridiculous reducer on Cheick Tiote. That was straight out of 1987. He could easily have been sent off you know, because both feet were off the ground and he almost scissored Tiote from the side. It was diabolical, reckless, predictable and highly amusing. 2 min Tiote is limping off to receive further treatment, though I reckon he'll be okay. 4 min Santon runs down the left, nips infield between Bardsley and Larsson and is brought down. The free-kick is swung over by Ryan Taylor and headed behind for a corner. 5 min The corner comes to nothing, with Tiote \u2013 back on the field now \u2013 penalised for a foul on the keeper Mignolet. 6 min Cattermole isn't covering himself in glory here. He's just dived to win a free-kick down the left. All he needs to do now is ineptly concede a penalty and he'll have done the Michael Ball hat-trick. 9 min Neither side has really got going yet, mainly because the game hasn't really got going. Play has been constantly interrupted by niggly fouls. 10 min Larsson's free-kick from the right is blocked by Taylor, who had charged from the wall and was only eight yards or so from the ball. Mike Dean didn't spot it. 11 min Is anyone reading? I'm all for loneliness, solitude, living in a bunker, but at least one email would be nice. 12 min The first chance of the match. Bendtner puts Larsson clear on the right-hand side of the box, but his cutback bisects Sessegnon and McClean. Earlier in the move Cabaye was late on Bardsley, and when play stops Mike Dean books him. If I were a betting man I'd be staking my last Rolo, and then some, on a red card today. 14 min \"As a token reference to Twin Peaks in a Smyth MBM, I'd like to know at which point, if at all, is it advisable to watch the prequel Fire Walk with Me,\" says Phil Podolsky. \"I'm now at episode five (and absolutely loving it. A delightfully witty show and the young Sean Young and Lara Flynn Boyle aren't too shabby either).\" Wait till you've seen the whole lot, Windom Earle and all. And then wait some more until you are in the perfect mood for Lynch to hit you as hard as he can. 16 min Simpson is fortunate not to be booked for a sly block on McClean. The game is poor at the moment, bitty and witless. A derby, then. 17 min \"Cattermole is a douchebag, but Cabaye also has a mean streak and just showed it,\" says Scott Bassett. \"No comparison, really, but it's there.\" Yeah, the two midfields have one major thing in common, and it's not a feminine side. 18 min Tiote has a bit of a clumsy hack at Cattermole, for which he could easily have been booked. Instead Mike Dean gives him a last warning; while he's doing so, there's a bit of shoving between players. 19 min: IT'S ALL KICKED OFF This was always going to happen. McClean is late on Simpson, who springs to his feet and puts his head against McClean's. Then players from both sides charge over and start shoving each other; on the touchline, Alan Pardew and Martin O'Neill are having a pop. After a couple of minutes of bristle and bullshit, Mike Dean booked both McClean and Simpson. 22 min Demba Ba is booked for a sliding foul on Gardner. That's the fifth yellow card of the match. 23 min: PENALTY TO SUNDERLAND And a sixth yellow card. Williamson has been penalised for pulling Turner's shirt at a free kick. Fair play to Mike Dean; someone needs to take a stand on that kind of defending. GOAL! Newcastle 0-1 Sunderland (Bendtner 24 pen) Bendtner cracks an excellent penalty into the bottom-right corner. Krul dived the very way but it was well struck and well placed. 25 min The only problem with Mike Dean giving a penalty like that \u2013 and it was a penalty, no question \u2013 is that he has to do the same for the rest of the match. 26 min \"Should the ref just dole out preemptive yellows for both teams in this derby?\" says Scott Bassett. \"Calm things down a bit from the get-go.\" 27 min Apparently Fraizer Campbell, the Sunderland substitute, celebrated the goal in front of the Newcastle fans, Gary Neville-style. 28 min Chris Waddle, the ESPN summariser, agrees that it was a definite pelanty. It was courageous refereeing from Mike Dean; I remember him giving a similar one against Nemanja Vidic at Portsmouth in 2009-10. 29 min Cattermole is limping, karma having caught up with him maybe*. Sunderland are dominating the game at the moment, although it's still an essentially poor match. * Actually, it was Tiote's studs that caught with him; he stood on Cattermole's ankle. Again, he could easily have been booked. Has he been booked yet? I've lost count. 30 min Gutierrez goes down after a tackle from Bardsley, and Mike Dean tells him to get up. Now Gutierrez is having a slanging match with Larsson. Some petulant games have a certain charm, like Holland v Portugal in the 2006 World Cup. This isn't one of those games. It's just grown men behaving like bairns. 32 min Krul makes a fine save from Bendtner. It was a brilliant effort. He chested a long free-kick down on the edge of the box before sweeping it towards goal on the half-volley. The excellent Krul plunged to his left to palm it away. 33 min \"I can't understand all this criticism of Mike Dean,\" says Chas Marshall, who may or may be a Sunderland fan. \"He's clearly an excellent ref...\" 35 min Gardner's long-range shot is deflected for a corner. Sunderland are completely on top. They have been able to play football in the little interludes between the free-kicks, whereas Newcastle have lost their focus because of all the acrimony. 36 min \"Agree with Scott Bassett that Cabaye has a worrying habit of wiping people out \u2013 that 'Dreamboat' tag is a bit misleading,\" says Phil Booth. \"'Steamboat' could be better?\" That was taken in the 1980s. 37 min Turn over to BBC1 right now and look at David James's shirt. 38 min \"In respect of the batch of signings for the PL teams this season, has any team done better than Newcastle?\" says Michael Harker. \"Obertan is uneven, but all the others look to be turning out well. Compare to the new boys at Liverpool.\" No. Even though they are playing poorly today, Newcastle have done brilliantly in the transfer market. Isn't it all because of Alan Carr's dad? 39 min I can't remember Ba or Cisse touching the ball. They might now, because Bardsley has headed Ryan Taylor's cross behind for a corner. Sunderland's defenders might want to keep their hands to themselves when it comes in. It's swung beyond the far post by Taylor, and Coloccini's on-the-run header from six yards is pushed away by Mignolet. It was a fairly straightforward save. 40 min Apparently David James's shirt is a waistcoat. I'm no Gok Wan, clearly, but the point stands: look at it. 42 min \"We (Newcastle) are basically Stoke now,\" says Oliver Lewis. \"For a while now we've been playing awful football, can't pass, won't pass, hoof a lot, very flat midfield no connection. At least Stoke get the ball in the box for their strikers.\" They've been really poor today. Did the successful bullying of Manchester United make Pardew go too far with that approach? 44 min Ba hits the bar! He got between Cattermole and O'Shea at the near post to meet Taylor's inswinging corner with a firm, instinctive header from six yards that clattered off the bar. 45 min All those early fouls mean there will be three hours' minutes' stoppage time. Half time: Newcastle 0-1 Sunderland Newcastle ended the half strongly, and had an appeal for a penalty when Ba fell over in the box after a challenge from from O'Shea. Chris Waddle said O'Shea got the ball, although I'd like to see another replay. Half time emails \"Is there a more violent player than Lee Cattermole? He defines precisely 'that sort of player'. He's one of the few these days who regularly sets out to hurt opponents through premediated and intimidatory fouling. Doing so in the first minute when he knows the referee won't send him off is a coward's trick. He's a good enough player not to play this way \u2013 but he does. Football would be better off without him\" \u2013 Gary Naylor. \"Google maps puts me 1.4 miles from the stadium, and you can hear when anything of significance happens even with the windows closed. I'll know if Newcastle score, that's for damn sure\" \u2013 Chris Humphrey. \"Classic Martin O'Neill moment. Weeave after weeeave after weeeave...\" \u2013 Phil Podolsky. \"This game is dog pucky\" \u2013 Alex Netherton. This is a good question, from George Wright. \"ESPN have just said that there's no local players for either side (Cattermole's from Middlesbrough), and that's probably not that unusual for modern derbies. So what do you think gets players so het up by the affairs? Are they less far removed from the fans than their lifestyles indicate, or (my preferred option) do they just like any excuse for a rumpus?\" I have no idea. I certainly don't think they are less removed from the fans than their lifestyles indicate, and a problem with many modern footballers is that they are wanderers who never really invest emotionally in their club (despite all that ostentatious badge-kissing). So what's the reason? Maybe players just see it as an easy way to win favour, I don't know. Email of the day \"'Did the successful bullying of Manchester United make Pardew go too far with that approach?'\" quotes Colin Laird. \"What F*!* what? Man United bullied? What bull. Newcastle are in a false position and their Manager is a southern charlatan! 19!\" I must have imagined Newcastle slaughtering United 3-0, with Demba Ba and Shola Ameobi riding roughshod over Phil Jones and Rio Ferdinand. 1.07pm Here's David James's waistcoat. And you thought Ryan Gosling's jacket in Drive was cool. 46 min Newcastle have made a half-time substitution, with Hatim Ben Arfa replacing Davide Santon. Ben Arfa will play right wing, with Ryan Taylor moving to left back. Apparently there was a contretemps in the tunnel between some backroom staff. 47 min An excellent start from Newcastle. Gutierrez teases Bardsley and puts in a good, flat cross towards Ba, who heads wide from eight yards. It wasn't an easy chance, because he didn't have much momentum in his body when he met the ball, but he should have worked Mignolet. 48 min Ba curls not far wide from 20 yards after a neat one-touch move. This is really good stuff from Newcastle. 49 min \"It's not advisable to watch Fire Walk With Me until you've seen every episode of Twin Peaks,\" says Enna Cooper. \"Despite being a prequel it presumes that you already know everything that happens in both seasons so 1) it won't make any sense whatsoever (even when you have seen both seasons it may only make partial sense) and 2) it will carelessly give away the answer to who killed Laura Palmer. Watching it any sooner would be a bit like inviting your weird uncle round for tea and a spot of molestation, only for him to reveal the twist to every film you've not yet watched. A friend recently went to a Twin Peaks weekender and watched both seasons in a sleep-deprived fugue, then went home and immediately watched Fire Walk With Me. Apparently it has never made more sense than on that viewing.\" It's bad to have a bad uncle. That doesn't surprise me with Lynch, mind; Mulholland Drive goes to another level if you watch it in the mezzanine hours. 51 min Gardner is booked for a bad tackle on Coloccini in the centre circle. His right studs were showing and, as Chris Waddle says on ESPN, had they been a fraction higher he would probably have gone off. As it was he caught him at the bottom of the ankle. 52 min \"Re George Wright's question, I have always wondered why certain traits, e.g. England being bad at penalties (and Germany being good), Man U scoring last minute goals etc, seem to endure despite teams being totally different over time,\" says Jonathan Siu. \"I think Jonathan Wilson reckons that the fans must play a part in being a team's \"memory\", and I tend to agree. If 60,000 people are screaming for a Newcastle player to kick a Sunderland player, you'd have to be a pretty emotionless person not to react.\" Yeah that makes a lot of sense. United's late goals have a lot to do with the manager, of course; also these things perpetuate themselves after a while. 53 min Newcastle continue to press, with three corners in 90 seconds and Turner heading not far wide of his own goal. 54 min \"Wonder why, when Cattermole's challenge is no worse than some of those the Newcastle players have committed, he's one the one villified?\" says David Goodman. \"Bandwagon and jumping comes to mind.\" Nope. Cattermole had both feet off the ground and, as far as I'm aware, the others didn't. That was the difference. 55 min Martin O'Neill might be tempted to switch to five in midfield if it continues like this. Newcastle have been totally dominant since half-time. 56 min Tiote shoots high and wide from 30 yards. Sunderland just can't get out. 57 min Tim Krul makes a brilliant double save from Larsson and McClean! From nowhere Larsson found himself through on goal, and his shot was saved by the advancing Krul. The rebound came to McClean, who hit it first time towards the far corner, and Krul stuck out his left leg to save. 58 min: SESSEGNON SENT OFF There's a surprise. Stephane Sessegon has been sent off. There was a tangle in the centre circle, and Sessegnon swung an arm into Tiote, just below the neck. Tiote waited for a couple of seconds and then went down clutching his face. Risible nonsense from Tiote, utterly pathetic. No arguments with the decision, though. He had to go. 60 min Sunderland are camped in their own box now, playing a 4-4-0-0-0-0-0-0-1 formation. I can't see them hanging on for another half an hour, although their spirit is such that you never really know. 64 min \"Oliver's right,\" says Scott Bassett of the email in the 42nd minute. \"Newcastle's midfield have shut down and there's no supply line for our fine strikers. There's a raging debate for some Newcastle fans about Cabaye's role and his creativity \u2013 or lack of it. Some think Pardew's forcing to play too deep and defensively and others argue Cabaye's just not that creative player that would make the offense tick.\" 66 min Tiote, still alive, lashes a volley wide from the edge of the area when Guitierrez's excellent cross is only half cleared. 67 min \"'I must have imagined Newcastle slaughtering United 3-0, with Demba Ba and Shola Ameobi riding roughshod over Phil Jones and Rio Ferdinand,'\" quotes our old friend Colin Laird. \"Much can be achieved against the odds with the Ref on your side.\" Much can be achieved with two eyes, too. 68 min This is a slightly better spell for Sunderland, in the sense that they are crossing the halfway line every now and then. When Cattermole does so, he is shoved over by Tiote, who is booked for repeat offending. That's the eighth yellow card of the match, to go with Sessegnon's red. 69 min Michael Turner gets away with a handball in his own box. He jumped for a long, angled cross from the left with Demba Ba; in doing so he inadvertently draped his left hand around Demba Ba's bald pate, and the ball hit the top of his hand. The strange thing is that hardly anyone appealed, but replays showed it was definitely handball. \"That's a pelanty,\" says Chris Waddle, and it's hard to disagree. 70 min Here's Colin Laird again. \"Then you might want to grow 2 in order to realize that United will not be bullied.\" This has been fun, Colin, and I sincerely hope we can do it again sometime, but I've got to go and drink some bleach now. Bye! 72 min Sunderland replace the goalscorer Nicklas Bendtner with Fraizer Campbell. That's a good move, as Campbell is more likely to stretch the defence and buy Sunderland some time. Newcastle are also making a change, with Shola Ameobi on for the anonymous Papiss Cisse. 73 min Another Sunderland substitution. Jack Colback replaces Sebastian Larsson, who was ill all week and is retching on the way off. What a thoroughly impressive, resourceful player he is. 74 min Ben Arfa skins McClean and then nutmegs Richards, but his low pass across the face of goal is blocked by Turner. 75 min Non-surprise of the day (3): AVB has left Chelsea. 76 min Newcastle have another appeal for a penalty when the ball hits O'Shea in the box. Even if it did hit his arm \u2013 and I'm not sure it did \u2013 he was so close to the ball that it would have been really harsh. 77 min Another glorious piece of skill from the little-known Ben Arfa. He receives a crossfield pass, beats Richardson with a lovely dragback and smashes a shot towards the near post that is beaten away for a corner by Mignolet. It was a fairly standard save at the near post, but it was delicious skill. 78 min Yet another Newcastle appeal for a penalty, this time when Ben Arfa falls over after a challenge from McClean. It would have been very soft, McClean just leaned into him. But it was another brilliant piece of play from Ben Arfa, who nutmegged Richardson with contemptuous ease. In the last 10 minutes he has given Richardson the mother of all chasings. Richardson will know what the phrase \"twisted blood\" means after this. 79 min \"If only Tiote could get a two-match ban when the FA review the video of his play-acting,\" says Luke Regan. \"If they are serious about stamping out 'this kind of thing' TM, then they should apply a similar process to that which they follow for violent conduct missed by the ref. It's so difficult to judge in real-time but that doesn't mean it should go unpunished.\" Completely agree. And if there's the odd bit of collateral damage \u2013 one player in 100 banned on a borderline case \u2013 then so be it. If Tiote gets a two- or three-match ban he won't do that again. It's simple. 81 min As with all Martin O'Neill's teams, Sunderland are a triumph of the human spirit. They have been battered since half time, yet Mignolet has not had a really hard save to make. 82 min: PENALTY TO NEWCASTLE Mignolet will have a difficult save to make now. It was hopeless defending from Campbell, who slid in and took Ameobi out on the left side of the box. There was no need to go to ground at all, and it was a clear penalty. 82 min: WHAT A SAVE! A fantastic stop from Mignolet! Ba swept a crisp penalty towards the bottom-right corner, and Mignolet got down to his left to palm it away. It was a wonderful stop; the kick wasn't right in the corner, but it was all along the floor so Mignolet had to get all the way down. Moments later, Ameobi's 15-yard volley was deflected just wide. Sunderland are being blitzed now. 83 min Mignolet was miles off his line when Ba took that penalty, so it really should have been retaken. 84 min There was a bit of a rumpus between Pardew and O'Neill when the penalty was given. Pardew celebrated in the direction of the Sunderland dugout; O'Neill got straight to his feet and the two had a brief slanging match. 85 min Kieran Richardson has been put out of his misery, with former footballer Wayne Bridge replacing him. 86 min \"I didn't realise that Kneejerkery's Colin Laird played for Manchester United,\" says Mac Millings. \"He seems to have been terribly affected emotionally by that bullying they got off of Newcastle that time.\" 87 min Newcastle have had 110 per cent of the possession since half time. Sunderland are now playing 8-0-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0. Their defending has verged on the heroic. 88 min \"So, let me get this straight,\" says Paul Taylor. \"We have a contested situation with one opponent, a referee, and a second opponent, and some bullying going on to get favorable decisions. Sad, sad, sad. Compare that with the institution of marriage--it's a contested situation with one player who makes all the calls and gets them right 100% of the time. No?\" 89 min Peter Lovenkrands replaces Ryan Taylor. 90 min Tiote puts his stud on the top of the ball, from where it rolls onto the ankle of McClean. He is aggrieved \u2013 and you can understand why because that would really hurt \u2013 although I don't think there was any intent from Tiote. Still, Sunderland get the free kick and that allows them to waste another 30 seconds. There will be five minutes of added mayhem. GOAL! Newcastle 1-1 Sunderland (Ameobi 90+1) Big Shola does it to Sunderland yet again! It's so cruel on Sunderland, but Newcastle fully deserve it for their second-half dominance. A long, angled cross from the left was flicked on by the head of Williamson, and Ameobi got behind former footballer Wayne Bridge to stud the ball through Mignolet from a few yards. That was a decent finish actually, because the ball kicked up off the wet surface. Sunderland appealed for offside, but I'm pretty sure Ameobi was fine. 90+3 min Newcastle are pushing for a fairytale winner, and it's as much as Sunderland can do just to boot the ball into touch. They are out on their feet. 90+4 min What a chance for Williamson! Cabaye's mishit shot came to him 10 yards from goal; he moved inside Cattermole but his touch was a bit heavy and Turner slid in to clear for a corner. That led to a desperate scramble on the six-yard line, with Cattermole eventually clearing. He has had a wonderful second half. Full time: Newcastle 1-1 Sunderland That's it. If the first half was a stinker, then the second half was primal and utterly exhilarating. Both managers look extremely proud of their players, and rightly so... Hang on, Lee Cattermole has been sent off after the final whistle! He was moaning at Mike Dean, a good two or three minutes after the game had ended, and Dean showed him a straight red card. What a strange man Cattermole is. He showed outstanding discipline for almost all of the game, but lost it at the start and at the finish. Anyway, thanks for your emails, I'm off for a lie-down.",

This match is <strong>HUGE</strong> \u2013 huge enough to have capital letters and be bolded up, even on a Sunday \u2013 yet it's rarely mentioned in the same breath as the Manchester, Merseyside, Glasgow and north London derbies. There's certainly an element of geographical snobbery in that, though it might also be because this hasn't been a regular fixture. Today is only the 38th match between the sides since 1970.</p> <p>It's hard to remember the last time Newcastle and Sunderland met with both sides in such rude health. Newcastle are still in the race for a Champions League place \u2013 which, on a pound-for-pound basis, would perhaps be their greatest achievement of the last few decades \u2013 while Sunderland have been reborn under the magnificent Martin O'Neill. Sunderland were thrashed 5-1 at Mike Ashley Field last season, and haven't won there for 12 years. If they do so today, the collective man-love for O'Neill in the SR postal district will be off the scale.</p> <p>Kick off is at <strong>midday</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news</strong> Sunderland are playing two up front, which is a bit of a surprise \u2013 especially as the additional striker is Nicklas Bendtner rather than England's Fraizer Campbell. Jack Colback drops out. That's Sunderland's only change from last weekend's defeat by West Brom; the excellent Stephane Sessegnon starts despite a delay on his journey back from Benin's midweek match in Ethopia. Newcastle are unchanged.</p> <p><strong>Newcastle (4-4-2)</strong> Krul; Simpson, Williamson, Coloccini, Santon; Ryan Taylor, Cabaye, Tiote, Gutierrez; Ba, Cisse.<br>Subs: Elliot, Guthrie, Ben Arfa, Lovenkrands, Shola Ameobi, Obertan, Perch.</p> <p><strong>Sunderland (4-4-2)</strong> Mignolet; Bardsley, O'Shea, Turner, Richardson;<br>Larsson, Cattermole, Gardner, McClean; Sessegnon, Bendtner.<br>Subs: Gordon, Bridge, Campbell, Kilgallon, Colback, Vaughan, Meyler.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> Mike Dean (Wirral)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Previously on Newcastle v Sunderland ... </strong> This fixture has produced some memorable moments down the years: Howard Gayle and particularly Gary Bennett <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-LREecZstk#t=2m30s\">losing it after incessant racist abuse</a> in 1985; Paul Hardyman <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=938t45iqVok#t=0m15s\">almost booting John Burridge's head off</a>; the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vkTXwO98sc\">Gates/Gabbiadini show in the play-off semi-final of 1990</a>; the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_NOH2X05w\">sky falling in on Ruud Gullit in 1999</a>; Niall Quinn's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgvunhc-My4&amp;feature=related\">majestic winner the following year</a>; and Kevin Nolan's hat-trick in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BddTrOgkM-U\">last season's thrashing</a>.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>11.43am</strong> \"For intensity, this makes El Clasico look like a reserve game,\" says Chas Marshall. \"Newcastle have surprised me this year, I fancied them to struggle. But even the most one-eyed Mackem has to concede that Pardew has done unexpectedly well. I think we'll beat them today, though, noisily and with relish.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>11.58am</strong> \"I love the summariser's calm description description of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-LREecZstk#t=2m30s\">Bennett's 'reckless challenge' in that clip</a>,\" says David Thompson. \"How would the media react to such a challenge today?\" It really doesn't bear thinking about.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Non-surprise of the day</strong> The atmosphere at Mike Ashley Field is mag<em>nif</em>icent.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Sunderland kick off from left to right. Eventually: they didn't hear Mike Dean's whistle the first time, such is the wall of noise. Sunderland are in red-and-white stripes; Newcastle are in black-and-white stripes.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>33 seconds</strong> Non-surprise of the day (2): Lee Cattermole is booked for a ridiculous reducer on Cheick Tiote. That was straight out of 1987. He could easily have been sent off you know, because both feet were off the ground and he almost scissored Tiote from the side. It was diabolical, reckless, predictable and highly amusing.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Tiote is limping off to receive further treatment, though I reckon he'll be okay.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> Santon runs down the left, nips infield between Bardsley and Larsson and is brought down. The free-kick is swung over by Ryan Taylor and headed behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> The corner comes to nothing, with Tiote \u2013&#xa0;back on the field now \u2013 penalised for a foul on the keeper Mignolet.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6 min</strong> Cattermole isn't covering himself in glory here. He's just dived to win a free-kick down the left. All he needs to do now is ineptly concede a penalty and he'll have done the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2312825/Ball-sorry-for-Ronaldo-stamp.html\">Michael Ball hat-trick</a>.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9 min</strong> Neither side has really got going yet, mainly because the game hasn't really got going. Play has been constantly interrupted by niggly fouls.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10 min</strong> Larsson's free-kick from the right is blocked by Taylor, who had charged from the wall and was only eight yards or so from the ball. Mike Dean didn't spot it.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Is anyone reading? I'm all for loneliness, solitude, living in a bunker, but at least one email would be nice.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12 min</strong> The first chance of the match. Bendtner puts Larsson clear on the right-hand side of the box, but his cutback bisects Sessegnon and McClean. Earlier in the move Cabaye was late on Bardsley, and when play stops Mike Dean books him. If I were a betting man I'd be staking my last Rolo, and then some, on a red card today.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> \"As a token reference to Twin Peaks in a Smyth MBM, I'd like to know at which point, if at all, is it advisable to watch the prequel Fire Walk with Me,\" says Phil Podolsky. \"I'm now at episode five (and absolutely loving it. A delightfully witty show and the young Sean Young and Lara Flynn Boyle aren't too shabby either).\" Wait till you've seen the whole lot, Windom Earle and all. And then wait some more until you are in the perfect mood for Lynch to hit you as hard as he can.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Simpson is fortunate not to be booked for a sly block on McClean. The game is poor at the moment, bitty and witless. A derby, then.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> \"Cattermole is a douchebag, but Cabaye also has a mean streak and just showed it,\" says Scott Bassett. \"No comparison, really, but it's there.\" Yeah, the two midfields have one major thing in common, and it's not a feminine side.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>18 min</strong> Tiote has a bit of a clumsy hack at Cattermole, for which he could easily have been booked. Instead Mike Dean gives him a last warning; while he's doing so, there's a bit of shoving between players.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>19 min: IT'S ALL KICKED OFF</strong> This was always going to happen. McClean is late on Simpson, who springs to his feet and puts his head against McClean's. Then players from both sides charge over and start shoving each other; on the touchline, Alan Pardew and Martin O'Neill are having a pop. After a couple of minutes of bristle and bullshit, Mike Dean booked both McClean and Simpson.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Demba Ba is booked for a sliding foul on Gardner. That's the fifth yellow card of the match.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>23 min: PENALTY TO SUNDERLAND</strong> And a sixth yellow card. Williamson has been penalised for pulling Turner's shirt at a free kick. Fair play to Mike Dean; someone needs to take a stand on that kind of defending.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Newcastle 0-1 Sunderland (Bendtner 24 pen)</strong> Bendtner cracks an excellent penalty into the bottom-right corner. Krul dived the very way but it was well struck and well placed.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> The only problem with Mike Dean giving a penalty like that \u2013 and it was a penalty, no question \u2013 is that he has to do the same for the rest of the match.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>26 min</strong> \"Should the ref just dole out preemptive yellows for both teams in this derby?\" says Scott Bassett. \"Calm things down a bit from the get-go.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>27 min</strong> Apparently Fraizer Campbell, the Sunderland substitute, celebrated the goal in front of the Newcastle fans, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QubF5Afcuek\">Gary Neville-style</a>.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> Chris Waddle, the ESPN summariser, agrees that it was a definite pelanty. It was courageous refereeing from Mike Dean; I remember him giving a similar one against Nemanja Vidic at Portsmouth in 2009-10.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Cattermole is limping, karma having caught up with him maybe*. Sunderland are dominating the game at the moment, although it's still an essentially poor match.</p> <p>* Actually, it was Tiote's studs that caught with him; he stood on Cattermole's ankle. Again, he could easily have been booked. Has he been booked yet? I've lost count.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>30 min</strong> Gutierrez goes down after a tackle from Bardsley, and Mike Dean tells him to get up. Now Gutierrez is having a slanging match with Larsson. Some petulant games have a certain charm, like Holland v Portugal in the 2006 World Cup. This isn't one of those games. It's just grown men behaving like bairns.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>32 min</strong> Krul makes a fine save from Bendtner. It was a brilliant effort. He chested a long free-kick down on the edge of the box before sweeping it towards goal on the half-volley. The excellent Krul plunged to his left to palm it away.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> \"I can't understand all this criticism of Mike Dean,\" says Chas Marshall, who may or may be a Sunderland fan. \"He's clearly an excellent ref...\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Gardner's long-range shot is deflected for a corner. Sunderland are completely on top. They have been able to play football in the little interludes between the free-kicks, whereas Newcastle have lost their focus because of all the acrimony.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> \"Agree with Scott Bassett that Cabaye has a worrying habit of wiping people out \u2013 that 'Dreamboat' tag is a bit misleading,\" says Phil Booth. \"'Steamboat' could be better?\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkI_1Q-vFAA\">That was taken in the 1980s</a>.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>37 min</strong> Turn over to BBC1 <strong>right now</strong> and look at David James's shirt.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> \"In respect of the batch of signings for the PL teams this season, has any team done better than Newcastle?\" says Michael Harker. \"Obertan is uneven, but all the others look to be turning out well. Compare to the new boys at Liverpool.\" No. Even though they are playing poorly today, Newcastle have done brilliantly in the transfer market. Isn't it all because of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Carr\">Alan Carr's dad</a>?</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>39 min</strong> I can't remember Ba or Cisse touching the ball. They might now, because Bardsley has headed Ryan Taylor's cross behind for a corner. Sunderland's defenders might want to keep their hands to themselves when it comes in. It's swung beyond the far post by Taylor, and Coloccini's on-the-run header from six yards is pushed away by Mignolet. It was a fairly straightforward save.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>40 min</strong> Apparently David James's shirt is a waistcoat. I'm no Gok Wan, clearly, but the point stands: look at it.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>42 min</strong> \"We (Newcastle) are basically Stoke now,\" says Oliver Lewis. \"For a while now we've been playing awful football, can't pass, won't pass, hoof a lot, very flat midfield no connection. At least Stoke get the ball in the box for their strikers.\" They've been really poor today. Did the successful bullying of Manchester United make Pardew go too far with that approach?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Ba hits the bar! He got between Cattermole and O'Shea at the near post to meet Taylor's inswinging corner with a firm, instinctive header from six yards that clattered off the bar.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> All those early fouls mean there will be three <strike> hours' </strike> minutes' stoppage time.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Half time: Newcastle 0-1 Sunderland</strong> Newcastle ended the half strongly, and had an appeal for a penalty when Ba fell over in the box after a challenge from from O'Shea. Chris Waddle said O'Shea got the ball, although I'd like to see another replay.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Half time emails</strong> </p> <p>\"Is there a more violent player than Lee Cattermole? He defines precisely 'that sort of player'. He's one of the few these days who regularly sets out to hurt opponents through premediated and intimidatory fouling. Doing so in the first minute when he knows the referee won't send him off is a coward's trick. He's a good enough player not to play this way \u2013 but he does. Football would be better off without him\" \u2013 Gary Naylor.</p> <p>\"Google maps puts me 1.4 miles from the stadium, and you can hear when anything of significance happens even with the windows closed. I'll know if Newcastle score, that's for damn sure\" \u2013&#xa0;Chris Humphrey.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJY7JSHA3SY\">Classic Martin O'Neill moment</a>. Weeave after weeeave after weeeave...\"&#xa0;\u2013 Phil Podolsky.</p> <p>\"This game is dog pucky\" \u2013 Alex Netherton.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>This is a good question,</strong> from George Wright.</p> <p>\"ESPN have just said that there's no local players for either side (Cattermole's from Middlesbrough), and that's probably not that unusual for modern derbies. So what do you think gets players so het up by the affairs? Are they less far removed from the fans than their lifestyles indicate, or (my preferred option) do they just like any excuse for a rumpus?\" </p> <p>I have no idea. I certainly don't think they are less removed from the fans than their lifestyles indicate, and a problem with many modern footballers is that they are wanderers who never really invest emotionally in their club (despite all that ostentatious badge-kissing). So what's the reason? Maybe players just see it as an easy way to win favour, I don't know.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Email of the day</strong> \"'Did the successful bullying of Manchester United make Pardew go too far with that approach?'\" quotes Colin Laird. \"What F*!* what? Man United bullied? What bull. Newcastle are in a false position and their Manager is a southern charlatan! 19!\" I must have imagined Newcastle slaughtering United 3-0, with Demba Ba and Shola Ameobi riding roughshod over Phil Jones and Rio Ferdinand.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>1.07pm</strong> Here's <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/8rwjeb\">David James's waistcoat</a>. And you thought Ryan Gosling's jacket in Drive was cool.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Newcastle have made a half-time substitution, with Hatim Ben Arfa replacing Davide Santon. Ben Arfa will play right wing, with Ryan Taylor moving to left back. Apparently there was a contretemps in the tunnel between some backroom staff.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> An excellent start from Newcastle. Gutierrez teases Bardsley and puts in a good, flat cross towards Ba, who heads wide from eight yards. It wasn't an easy chance, because he didn't have much momentum in his body when he met the ball, but he should have worked Mignolet.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> Ba curls not far wide from 20 yards after a neat one-touch move. This is really good stuff from Newcastle.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> \"It's not advisable to watch Fire Walk With Me until you've seen every episode of Twin Peaks,\" says Enna Cooper. \"Despite being a prequel it presumes that you already know everything that happens in both seasons so 1) it won't make any sense whatsoever (even when you have seen both seasons it may only make partial sense) and 2) it will carelessly give away the answer to who killed Laura Palmer. Watching it any sooner would be a bit like inviting your weird uncle round for tea and a spot of molestation, only for him to reveal the twist to every film you've not yet watched. A friend recently went to a Twin Peaks weekender and watched both seasons in a sleep-deprived fugue, then went home and immediately watched Fire Walk With Me. Apparently it has never made more sense than on that viewing.\" It's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xffrgR1o4xM\">bad to have a bad uncle</a>. That doesn't surprise me with Lynch, mind; Mulholland Drive goes to another level if you watch it in the mezzanine hours.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>51 min</strong> Gardner is booked for a bad tackle on Coloccini in the centre circle. His right studs were showing and, as Chris Waddle says on ESPN, had they been a fraction higher he would probably have gone off. As it was he caught him at the bottom of the ankle.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> \"Re George Wright's question, I have always wondered why certain traits, e.g. England being bad at penalties (and Germany being good), Man U scoring last minute goals etc, seem to endure despite teams being totally different over time,\" says Jonathan Siu. \"I think Jonathan Wilson reckons that the fans must play a part in being a team's \"memory\", and I tend to agree. If 60,000 people are screaming for a Newcastle player to kick a Sunderland player, you'd have to be a pretty emotionless person not to react.\" Yeah that makes a lot of sense. United's late goals have a lot to do with the manager, of course; also these things perpetuate themselves after a while.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>53 min</strong> Newcastle continue to press, with three corners in 90 seconds and Turner heading not far wide of his own goal.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> \"Wonder why, when Cattermole's challenge is no worse than some of those the Newcastle players have committed, he's one the one villified?\" says David Goodman. \"Bandwagon and jumping comes to mind.\" Nope. Cattermole had both feet off the ground and, as far as I'm aware, the others didn't. That was the difference.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>55 min</strong> Martin O'Neill might be tempted to switch to five in midfield if it continues like this. Newcastle have been totally dominant since half-time.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> Tiote shoots high and wide from 30 yards. Sunderland just can't get out.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Tim Krul makes a brilliant double save from Larsson and McClean! From nowhere Larsson found himself through on goal, and his shot was saved by the advancing Krul. The rebound came to McClean, who hit it first time towards the far corner, and Krul stuck out his left leg to save.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>58 min: SESSEGNON SENT OFF</strong> There's a surprise. Stephane Sessegon has been sent off. There was a tangle in the centre circle, and Sessegnon swung an arm into Tiote, just below the neck. Tiote waited for a couple of seconds and then went down clutching his face. Risible nonsense from Tiote, utterly pathetic. No arguments with the decision, though. He had to go.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>60 min</strong> Sunderland are camped in their own box now, playing a 4-4-0-0-0-0-0-0-1 formation. I can't see them hanging on for another half an hour, although their spirit is such that you never really know.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>64 min</strong> \"Oliver's right,\" says Scott Bassett of the email in the 42nd minute. \"Newcastle's midfield have shut down and there's no supply line for our fine strikers. There's a raging debate for some Newcastle fans about Cabaye's role and his creativity \u2013 or lack of it. Some think Pardew's forcing to play too deep and defensively and others argue Cabaye's just not that creative player that would make the offense tick.\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Tiote, still alive, lashes a volley wide from the edge of the area when Guitierrez's excellent cross is only half cleared.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>67 min</strong> \"'I must have imagined Newcastle slaughtering United 3-0, with Demba Ba and Shola Ameobi riding roughshod over Phil Jones and Rio Ferdinand,'\" quotes our old friend Colin Laird. \"Much can be achieved against the odds with the Ref on your side.\" Much can be achieved with two eyes, too.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> This is a slightly better spell for Sunderland, in the sense that they are crossing the halfway line every now and then. When Cattermole does so, he is shoved over by Tiote, who is booked for repeat offending. That's the eighth yellow card of the match, to go with Sessegnon's red.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>69 min</strong> Michael Turner gets away with a handball in his own box. He jumped for a long, angled cross from the left with Demba Ba; in doing so he inadvertently draped his left hand around Demba Ba's bald pate, and the ball hit the top of his hand. The strange thing is that hardly anyone appealed, but replays showed it was definitely handball. \"That's a pelanty,\" says Chris Waddle, and it's hard to disagree.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> Here's Colin Laird again. \"Then you might want to grow 2 in order to realize that United will not be bullied.\" This has been fun, Colin, and I sincerely hope we can do it again sometime, but I've got to go and drink some bleach now. Bye!</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>72 min</strong> Sunderland replace the goalscorer Nicklas Bendtner with Fraizer Campbell. That's a good move, as Campbell is more likely to stretch the defence and buy Sunderland some time. Newcastle are also making a change, with Shola Ameobi on for the anonymous Papiss Cisse.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> Another Sunderland substitution. Jack Colback replaces Sebastian Larsson, who was ill all week and is retching on the way off. What a thoroughly impressive, resourceful player he is.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> Ben Arfa skins McClean and then nutmegs Richards, but his low pass across the face of goal is blocked by Turner.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> Non-surprise of the day (3): AVB has left Chelsea.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>76 min</strong> Newcastle have another appeal for a penalty when the ball hits O'Shea in the box. Even if it did hit his arm \u2013 and I'm not sure it did \u2013 he was so close to the ball that it would have been really harsh.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> Another glorious piece of skill from the little-known Ben Arfa. He receives a crossfield pass, beats Richardson with a lovely dragback and smashes a shot towards the near post that is beaten away for a corner by Mignolet. It was a fairly standard save at the near post, but it was delicious skill.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Yet another Newcastle appeal for a penalty, this time when Ben Arfa falls over after a challenge from McClean. It would have been very soft, McClean just leaned into him. But it was another brilliant piece of play from Ben Arfa, who nutmegged Richardson with contemptuous ease. In the last 10 minutes he has given Richardson the mother of all chasings. Richardson will know what the phrase \"twisted blood\" means after this.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> \"If only Tiote could get a two-match ban when the FA review the video of his play-acting,\" says Luke Regan. \"If they are serious about stamping out 'this kind of thing' TM, then they should apply a similar process to that which they follow for violent conduct missed by the ref. It's so difficult to judge in real-time but that doesn't mean it should go unpunished.\" Completely agree. And if there's the odd bit of collateral damage \u2013 one player in 100 banned on a borderline case \u2013 then so be it. If Tiote gets a two- or three-match ban he won't do that again. It's simple.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>81 min</strong> As with all Martin O'Neill's teams, Sunderland are a triumph of the human spirit. They have been battered since half time, yet Mignolet has not had a really hard save to make.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>82 min: PENALTY TO NEWCASTLE</strong> Mignolet will have a difficult save to make now. It was hopeless defending from Campbell, who slid in and took Ameobi out on the left side of the box. There was no need to go to ground at all, and it was a clear penalty.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>82 min: WHAT A SAVE!</strong> A fantastic stop from Mignolet! Ba swept a crisp penalty towards the bottom-right corner, and Mignolet got down to his left to palm it away. It was a wonderful stop; the kick wasn't right in the corner, but it was all along the floor so Mignolet had to get all the way down. Moments later, Ameobi's 15-yard volley was deflected just wide. Sunderland are being blitzed now.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Mignolet was miles off his line when Ba took that penalty, so it really should have been retaken.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> There was a bit of a rumpus between Pardew and O'Neill when the penalty was given. Pardew celebrated in the direction of the Sunderland dugout; O'Neill got straight to his feet and the two had a brief slanging match.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>85 min</strong> Kieran Richardson has been put out of his misery, with former footballer Wayne Bridge replacing him.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> \"I didn't realise that Kneejerkery's Colin Laird played for Manchester United,\" says Mac Millings. \"He seems to have been terribly affected emotionally by that bullying they got off of Newcastle that time.\"</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Newcastle have had 110 per cent of the possession since half time. Sunderland are now playing 8-0-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0. Their defending has verged on the heroic.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> \"So, let me get this straight,\" says Paul Taylor. \"We have a contested situation with one opponent, a referee, and a second opponent, and some bullying going on to get favorable decisions. Sad, sad, sad. Compare that with the institution of marriage--it's a contested situation with one player who makes all the calls and gets them right 100% of the time. No?\"</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> Peter Lovenkrands replaces Ryan Taylor.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> Tiote puts his stud on the top of the ball, from where it rolls onto the ankle of McClean. He is aggrieved \u2013 and you can understand why because that would really hurt \u2013 although I don't think there was any intent from Tiote. Still, Sunderland get the free kick and that allows them to waste another 30 seconds. There will be <strong>five minutes</strong> of added mayhem.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Newcastle 1-1 Sunderland (Ameobi 90+1)</strong> Big Shola does it to Sunderland yet again! It's so cruel on Sunderland, but Newcastle fully deserve it for their second-half dominance. A long, angled cross from the left was flicked on by the head of Williamson, and Ameobi got behind former footballer Wayne Bridge to stud the ball through Mignolet from a few yards. That was a decent finish actually, because the ball kicked up off the wet surface. Sunderland appealed for offside, but I'm pretty sure Ameobi was fine.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>90+3 min</strong> Newcastle are pushing for a fairytale winner, and it's as much as Sunderland can do just to boot the ball into touch. They are out on their feet.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>90+4 min</strong> What a chance for Williamson! Cabaye's mishit shot came to him 10 yards from goal; he moved inside Cattermole but his touch was a bit heavy and Turner slid in to clear for a corner. That led to a desperate scramble on the six-yard line, with Cattermole eventually clearing. He has had a wonderful second half.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>Full time: Newcastle 1-1 Sunderland</strong> That's it. If the first half was a stinker, then the second half was primal and utterly exhilarating. Both managers look extremely proud of their players, and rightly so... Hang on, <strong>Lee Cattermole has been sent off after the final whistle</strong>! He was moaning at Mike Dean, a good two or three minutes after the game had ended, and Dean showed him a straight red card. What a strange man Cattermole is. He showed outstanding discipline for almost all of the game, but lost it at the start and at the finish. Anyway, thanks for your emails, I'm off for a lie-down.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chelsea have parted company with Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. The manager has left the club following a string of poor results that culminated in Saturday's 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion which left the club fifth in the table. Villas-Boas's assistant, Roberto Di Matteo, has been appointed the new first-team coach until the end of the season. Villas-Boas joined the club eight months ago after the Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich paid Porto \u00a313.3m to make him Carlo Ancelotti's successor. A club statement read: \"The board would like to record our gratitude for his work and express our disappointment that the relationship has ended so early. \"Unfortunately the results and performances of the team have not been good enough and were showing no signs of improving at a key time in the season. \"The club is still competing in the latter stages of the Uefa Champions League and the FA Cup, as well as challenging for a top-four spot in the Premier League, and we aim to remain as competitive as possible on all fronts. With that in mind we felt our only option was to make a change at this time.\" There was speculation that Rafael Ben\u00edtez might be parachuted into Stamford Bridge but Di Matteo's appointment has ended such a possibility. Villas-Boas had been under mounting pressure after overseeing what was threatening to be Chelsea's worst season since Abramovich bought the club almost nine years ago. A run of just five wins from the last 16 games saw the side slide out of the top four, while they remain in real danger of crashing out of both the Champions League and the FA Cup in the next week and a half. Brought in to revamp an ageing squad after winning an incredible quadruple at Porto last season, Villas-Boas's reign was dogged by reports of the kind of dressing-room unrest that previous Chelsea managers have said led to their own downfall. Abramovich, who reportedly hand-picked Villas-Boas last summer when Guus Hiddink had been the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Carlo Ancelotti, appeared prepared to be more patient with the 34-year-old than previous bosses. The Russian seemingly recognised the difficulties in overhauling the squad and the playing style at Stamford Bridge. But, as when Luiz Felipe Scolari was sacked three years ago, it was fear of not qualifying for the Champions League that prompted Abramovich to act. Having repeatedly insisted he had the owner's full backing during the recent run, Villas-Boas appeared to acknowledge the writing might be on the wall during the past week and a half. An interview with a Portuguese radio station saw him admit for the first time he could lose his job, a possibility he refused to shy away from after yesterday's defeat at the Hawthorns. He said: \"Will this result increase pressure on me? You have to agree with it. We are in the same position, fifth, but we are now three points behind Arsenal. It is a big, big disappointment. Every defeat Chelsea suffers piles more pressure on any manager.\" Villas-Boas insisted it would not help his position to be given public backing from Abramovich. He said: \"I don't think so. There is no need for the owner to back us after such a poor display.\" Villas-Boas, who on Friday insisted he would \"never\" quit Chelsea, added: \"Am I the right man for the job? Yes. I wouldn't have taken it if I didn't think that.\" Di Matteo's first game in charge will be Tuesday night's FA Cup fifth-round replay at Birmingham.",

      "bodyText": "The Libyan government has been extremely apologetic about the appalling desecration of British second world war graves in the eastern city of Benghazi, a Foreign Office minister said on Sunday. The statement of regret came after video footage emerged showing graves in a British military cemetery in the city being destroyed by what appears to be an Islamist militia. The video, shot by the militia themselves, shows more than 30 armed men kicking down the gravestones of British servicemen while others use sledgehammers to break the cenotaph. \"Break the cross of the dogs,\" one man can be heard shouting as another soldier perches on a ladder to smash the cenotaph cross with a mallet. The Foreign Office said more than 200 headstones and the Cross of Remembrance in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in Benghazi were deliberately damaged on 24 and 26 February. About a quarter of the headstones in Benghazi military cemetery were also damaged. The Foreign Office has raised the matter with the Libyan government and local police. More than 1,200 Commonwealth soldiers and airmen are buried in Benghazi. Of the 1,051 identified graves, 851 are British. Many were members of the 7th Armoured Division \u2013 the Desert Rats \u2013 which played a key role in fighting for control of Libya and Egypt between 1941 and 1943. Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne said people would be understandably upset by images of damaged graves. But he said the attacks appeared to be part of a wider desecration and were not confined to British or Christian graves. Nor did they represent a response to last year's military action when British aircraft took part in a campaign that helped topple Colonel Gaddafi, he added. \"There is an appalling story and people will be shocked by the photos,\" he told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News . \"My grandfather's generation were truly heroic in that part of Africa in the second world war and I think people will be shocked by what they see. \"It is worth saying the Libyan authorities themselves are shocked too. We have had direct dealings with them. They have been extremely apologetic and made a very strong commitment they will get to the bottom of this happening. They will try and do everything they can to resolve it.\" He added: \"I would not want people to think this is somehow an ingratitude by the government of Libya. That's not the case.\" In a statement on its website, the National Transitional Council expressed deep regret at the desecration which it \"strongly condemned\". A Commonwealth War Graves Commission spokesman said headstones had been broken and disfigured in both the Benghazi war cemetery and the Benghazi British military cemetery. \"Both cemeteries will be restored to a standard befitting the sacrifice of those commemorated at Benghazi, but this could take some time because we will need to source replacement stones,\" he said. \"We will also need to be sure that it's safe for the detailed work to be carried out, but in the meantime we will ensure that temporary markers are erected over the graves.\" No militia has claimed responsibility for the desecration, but Libyan sources say the dress and comments of those filmed suggest a jihadist brigade. \"We don't support this action,\" said Farouk Ben Ahmeda, a militiaman in Misrata. \"This is a sin. These guys are messing up the revolution.\" One of the most prominent of the handful of Islamist militias in Libya, the Omar Mukghtar Brigade, condemned the attack. \"Whoever did this attack was wrong,\" said spokesman Abdul Jawad Albaree. \"Whoever did it wants to destroy whatever relations Libya has with Britain.\"",

      "bodyText": "Israel is not rushing towards war with Iran, President Shimon Peres will say on Sunday as he emphasises the value of the Israeli-American relationship in an attempt to smooth tensions between the two allies over the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic. According to a report in the Israeli daily Haaretz, Peres will tell the Washington conference of the pro-Israel lobby group Aipac: Israel is not rushing into war. We are a country that always seeks out peace and peace is always our preferred option, but our enemies should make no mistakes. We have fought six wars that were forced upon us and we have won them all. If another war is forced upon us, we will fight it and we will win it. Peres will also say he is \"confident that the United States will always stand by Israel\". Israel owes a debt to the US, and \"sometimes it does no harm to say 'thank you' \". He is due to speak shortly before President Barack Obama addresses the conference in what as seen as a crucial speech. Obama will seek to reassure delegates that he will watch Israel's back amid continuing anxiety in the US administration that the Jewish state is planning military action against Iran. He will meet the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, on Monday for talks on the issue. Netanyahi is expected to indicate that Israel will back off only if the US explicitly threatens to take military action itself should the Iranian nuclear programme advance beyond specific \"red lines\". Speculation about Israel's intentions continued to swirl ahead of an intensive two days of speeches and meetings. The Israeli columnist Gideon Levy wrote in Haaretz on Sunday that Israel was dictating policy to the White House: A new chapter is being written in the history of nations. Never before has a small country dictated to a superpower; never before has the chirp of a cricket sounded like a roar; never has the elephant resembled an ant - and vice versa \u2026 When [Netanyahu] goes to the White House tomorrow he will make a new demand: Either you or we [attack Iran], putting the leader of the free world in a tight spot. Obama does not want to ensnare his country in another war or in an energy crisis, but when Netanyahu hath demanded, who will not fear? In a long article for Foreign Policy, the US-based Israeli analyst Daniel Levy explores the domestic dynamics in Netanyahu's considerations on whether to launch military action. The prime minister, he says, has no domestic political need to go to war, and would face a barrage of criticism within Israel if he did: A tendency characterising Netanyahu's long term in office, and a counterintuitive one at that, is the degree to which he has been risk-averse, not only in matters of peace, but also in matters of war. No Operation Cast Leads, Lebanon wars, or Syria Deir ez-Zor attack missions under his watch. In fact, he has no record of military adventurism. What's more, Netanyahu hardly appears to be in need of a Hail Mary pass, military or otherwise, to salvage his political fortunes. Polls consistently show that he is a shoo-in for re-election. The right-wing block in Israel currently has a hegemonic grip on Israeli politics, something that seems unlikely to change \u2026 Former security establishment figures at the highest levels have mounted an unprecedented campaign warning Israel's leader and its public of the follies of launching a solo and premature Israeli military action against Iran. Most outspoken has been recently retired Mossad chief Meir Dagan, who has described a strike on Iran as 'the stupidest thing I have ever heard'. But he has not been alone. Other former IDF chiefs of staff, as well as Shin Bet and intel leaders, have joined the cautioning chorus. Many are unlikely to shut up if Bibi [Netanyahu] defies their counsel. And in the public arena, these voices cannot be dismissed as just so many self-serving chickenhawk politicians. The fallout from an attack on Iran is possibly the biggest threat to Bibi serving a third term. The piece is headlined: Netanyahu won't attack Iran - although the caveat (Probably) is appended in small letters.",

      "body": "<p>Israel is not rushing towards war with Iran, President Shimon Peres will say on Sunday as he emphasises the value of the Israeli-American relationship in an attempt to smooth tensions between the two allies over the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic.</p> <p>According to a report in the Israeli daily Haaretz, Peres will tell the Washington conference of the pro-Israel lobby group Aipac:</p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/peres-to-tell-aipac-israel-not-rushing-into-war-1.416276\" title=\"\">Israel is not rushing into war</a>. We are a country that always seeks out peace and peace is always our preferred option, but our enemies should make no mistakes. We have fought six wars that were forced upon us and we have won them all. If another war is forced upon us, we will fight it and we will win it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Peres will also say he is \"confident that the United States will always stand by Israel\". Israel owes a debt to the US, and \"sometimes it does no harm to say 'thank you' \".</p> <p>He is due to speak shortly before President Barack Obama addresses the conference in what as seen as a crucial speech. Obama will seek to reassure delegates that he will watch Israel's back amid continuing anxiety in the US administration that the Jewish state is planning military action against Iran.</p> <p>He will meet the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, on Monday for talks on the issue. Netanyahi is expected to indicate that Israel will back off only if the US explicitly threatens to take military action itself should the Iranian nuclear programme advance beyond specific \"red lines\".</p> <p>Speculation about Israel's intentions continued to swirl ahead of an intensive two days of speeches and meetings. The Israeli columnist Gideon Levy wrote in Haaretz on Sunday that <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/it-s-just-a-matter-of-time-before-u-s-tires-of-israel-1.416297\" title=\"\">Israel was dictating policy to the White House:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>A new chapter is being written in the history of nations. Never before has a small country dictated to a superpower; never before has the chirp of a cricket sounded like a roar; never has the elephant resembled an ant - and vice versa \u2026 When [Netanyahu] goes to the White House tomorrow he will make a new demand: Either you or we [attack Iran], putting the leader of the free world in a tight spot. Obama does not want to ensnare his country in another war or in an energy crisis, but when Netanyahu hath demanded, who will not fear?</p> </blockquote> <p>In a long article for Foreign Policy, the US-based Israeli analyst Daniel Levy explores the domestic dynamics in Netanyahu's considerations on whether to launch military action. The prime minister, he says, <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/03/02/netanyahu_won_t_attack_iran\" title=\"\">has no domestic political need to go to war, and would face a barrage of criticism within Israel if he did</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>A tendency characterising Netanyahu's long term in office, and a counterintuitive one at that, is the degree to which he has been risk-averse, not only in matters of peace, but also in matters of war. No Operation Cast Leads, Lebanon wars, or Syria Deir ez-Zor attack missions under his watch. In fact, he has no record of military adventurism. What's more, Netanyahu hardly appears to be in need of a Hail Mary pass, military or otherwise, to salvage his political fortunes. Polls consistently show that he is a shoo-in for re-election. The right-wing block in Israel currently has a hegemonic grip on Israeli politics, something that seems unlikely to change \u2026</p> <p>Former security establishment figures at the highest levels have mounted an unprecedented campaign warning Israel's leader and its public of the follies of launching a solo and premature Israeli military action against Iran. Most outspoken has been recently retired Mossad chief Meir Dagan, who has described a strike on Iran as 'the stupidest thing I have ever heard'. But he has not been alone. Other former IDF chiefs of staff, as well as Shin Bet and intel leaders, have joined the cautioning chorus. Many are unlikely to shut up if Bibi [Netanyahu] defies their counsel. And in the public arena, these voices cannot be dismissed as just so many self-serving chickenhawk politicians. The fallout from an attack on Iran is possibly the biggest threat to Bibi serving a third term.</p> </blockquote> <p>The piece is headlined: Netanyahu won't attack Iran - although the caveat (Probably) is appended in small letters.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Russians went to the polls on Sunday in a tense election that is expected to confirm Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency. Independent election monitors and opposition activists said they had documented many cases of electoral violations and fraud. Some 370,000 Russians were deployed as election monitors around the country, an unprecedented show of civic activism born of a growing protest movement against Putin's rule. Tensions ran high as protesters prepared to gather on Monday. Many have already decried the election as illegitimate, accusing Putin of unfairly using administrative resources to advance his candidacy and refusing to register candidates such as the liberal Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky. The police presence was stepped up in the capital on Sunday. Putin voted alongside his rarely seen wife, Lyudmila Putina. When asked if he expected to win in the first round, Putin answered: \"Everything depends on the voters.\" Yet a stage due to host the Kremlin's victory party was already being erected on Sunday morning. Fifteen minutes after Putin left the central Moscow polling site, three women tore off their shirts and began shouting \"Putin is a thief!\" They were dragged away by police. The central elections commission said 30% of eligible Russians had voted by 1pm Moscow time (9am GMT). Reports of violations were widespread and uploaded by the hundreds to social networking sites. Particularly common appeared to be the so-called \"carousel\", when voters were bussed to several polling sites in order to cast numerous votes. The practice was widespread in December's parliamentary vote, the contested results of which launched the unprecedented wave of protests seen in Moscow over the past three months. Alexey Navalny, a protest movement leader, said on Sunday that the presidential election was even \"dirtier\" than the December vote. The Kremlin set up webcams in polling sites around the country, ostensibly as a means of combatting fraud. One camera caught Ramzan Kadyrov, the thuggish leader of Chechnya, arriving at a polling site to an outbreak of applause. The Caucasus republics regularly bring in nearly 100% of votes for Putin and his party. Putin is hoping to return to the Kremlin following a four-year stint as prime minister. His camp has framed his campaign as a vote for \"stability\", warning of the disaster and chaos that would come to the country were he to lose. In the same vein, Putin has repeatedly blamed the protests against him on western forces seeking to destabilise the situation in the country. Russia's protesting opposition is hoping to highlight electoral fraud as a means of shining a light on Putin's fading popularity and what they say is his illegitimate claim to power. The Kremlin is deploying its youth groups to counter the opposition protests, a potentially explosive calculation. Tens of thousands of activists from Nashi \u2013 the Kremlin's youth organisation \u2013 are due to gather at the Kremlin on Sunday night, and at a nearby square on Monday as the opposition gathers nearby. Results are expected after the polls close in Russia's westernmost region, Kaliningrad, at 8pm (5pm GMT).",

      "bodyText": "Paul Nicholls has reported through his Betfair column that there is \"nothing major or new\" to pass on this morning about Kauto Star, who continues to recover from injuries he received in a fall at his Somerset stable nine days ago. \"He had his physio and an hour on the walker, and then we gave him a strong canter over 10 furlongs,\" Nicholls says. \"All was fine. We will look to step up his work next week, and I will give a further update tomorrow.\" Kauto Star is back down to 5-1 on Betfair for the Cheltenham Gold Cup a week on Friday, having been double those odds in the immediate aftermath of the news of his setback. It appears the market believes he will show up for the race, though how much his injury will have affected his preparation is a matter for conjecture. I think it's worth passing on the full details of what Donald McCain said to the press pack about Peddlers Cross on Saturday at Kelso. His tone got progressively downbeat until, by the end, I was beginning to have serious doubts about whether we will actually see the beast at the Cheltenham Festival. When Peddlers Cross was first mentioned, McCain's brisk response was: \"He's working away, he's grand, he's worked this week and he's worked again today. We're happy with him.\" But the trainer's mood seemed to droop a bit as he addressed the question of which race the horse would run in, the Arkle or the Jewson. \"I just don't know. We've got to school him because he had a setback. We're rolling on the road and I've not schooled him as much as I've wanted to. We'll school him this week and then we'll make the decision. As soon as we know, we'll tell everyone. To be fair to the horse, we've got to get him right and ready and decide what we're doing.\" Um, setback? We asked for clarity but McCain meant the muscle problem discovered after Peddlers Cross was beaten by Sprinter Sacre at Kempton in December, rather than a new injury. \"He pulled muscles and he was very, very sore, so, obviously, because of that, I've not been able to school him as hard as I wanted to. So we've just got to play it by ear quietly and see where we are. Every day we're doing something, but we've got to make sure he's OK the next. \"It'll be in the next few days it'll be decided. We're getting stuck into him, he's working hard, we'll have a couple of schools and see where we are.\" So, is he in fact certain to run at the Festival? \"I would think he will but, as I say, if people can just bear with me, as soon as I know, I'll tell everyone.\" Frankly, I'd be a bit gloomy on hearing that, if I'd had a bet on the beast. If you're thinking of supporting him, I'd make sure you do it with a firm that's offering \"non-runner, no bet\". Anyway, we'll hope for the best, with him as with Kauto Star. These are talented, charismatic horses and it would be a real shame if they joined the likes of Grandouet and Spirit Son in missing Cheltenham. Never mind March, Deacon Blues has just been ruled out for the entire year, after his trainer, James Fanshawe, found a small tear in his tendon. He won his last five races in 2011, starting with the Wokingham and ending with the British Champions Series Sprint. He seemed a strong candidate for any Group One sprint this year and it is awful that this should have happened. He's a gelding, so there is nothing for it but to try bringing him back next year, though he'll be six by then and will have a much more dubious profile. You can get 10-1 about Hohlethelonely (3.10) in the staying handicap hurdle at Huntingdon, bigger than you'd expect for a horse of his ability and recent form. The reason is the market's fear that he may refuse to race, always such an annoying way to do your dough. He did that once at Uttoxeter three years ago and then attempted a reprise on his latest start, when Harry Challoner eventually got him to race. They'd already lost the race, however, so that appears in his form figures as a bad run. Perhaps he's becoming a rogue who will fail to budge when the tapes go up today but at the moment he looks more like an awkward customer whose antics can be avoided if they're anticipated and with the right handling. Aidan Coleman, who rides on Sunday, is more capable than Challoner and better forewarned. Hohlethelonely won his two races before that last-time disaster, one of them over Sunday's course and distance, and he's only 5lb higher than for the most recent of them. I'm betting that he will jump off and that the 10-1 is an over-reaction. Handicapped on his hurdles form, Dot Or Feather (3.40) is an ex-pointer who stepped up when allowed to race over fences last time, winning an amateur riders' race on New Year's Day at Fakenham. He's 5lb higher on Sunday, which should allow him to be seriously competitive, and is 4-1. Click here for all the day's racecards, form, stats and results.

We asked for clarity but McCain meant the muscle problem discovered after Peddlers Cross was beaten by Sprinter Sacre at Kempton in December, rather than a new injury.</p> <p>\"He pulled muscles and he was very, very sore, so, obviously, because of that, I've not been able to school him as hard as I wanted to. So we've just got to play it by ear quietly and see where we are. Every day we're doing something, but we've got to make sure he's OK the next.</p> <p>\"It'll be in the next few days it'll be decided. We're getting stuck into him, he's working hard, we'll have a couple of schools and see where we are.\"</p> <p>So, is he in fact certain to run at the Festival? \"I would think he will but, as I say, if people can just bear with me, as soon as I know, I'll tell everyone.\"</p> <p>Frankly, I'd be a bit gloomy on hearing that, if I'd had a bet on the beast. If you're thinking of supporting him, I'd make sure you do it with a firm that's offering \"non-runner, no bet\".</p> <p>Anyway, we'll hope for the best, with him as with Kauto Star. These are talented, charismatic horses and it would be a real shame if they joined the likes of Grandouet and Spirit Son in missing Cheltenham.</p> <p>Never mind March, Deacon Blues has just been ruled out for the entire year, after his trainer, James Fanshawe, found a small tear in his tendon. He won his last five races in 2011, starting with the Wokingham and ending with the British Champions Series Sprint.</p> <p>He seemed a strong candidate for any Group One sprint this year and it is awful that this should have happened. He's a gelding, so there is nothing for it but to try bringing him back next year, though he'll be six by then and will have a much more dubious profile.</p> <p>You can get 10-1 about <strong>Hohlethelonely (3.10)</strong> in the staying handicap hurdle at Huntingdon, bigger than you'd expect for a horse of his ability and recent form. The reason is the market's fear that he may refuse to race, always such an annoying way to do your dough.</p> <p>He did that once at Uttoxeter three years ago and then attempted a reprise on his latest start, when Harry Challoner eventually got him to race. They'd already lost the race, however, so that appears in his form figures as a bad run.</p> <p>Perhaps he's becoming a rogue who will fail to budge when the tapes go up today but at the moment he looks more like an awkward customer whose antics can be avoided if they're anticipated and with the right handling. Aidan Coleman, who rides on Sunday, is more capable than Challoner and better forewarned.</p> <p>Hohlethelonely won his two races before that last-time disaster, one of them over Sunday's course and distance, and he's only 5lb higher than for the most recent of them. I'm betting that he will jump off and that the 10-1 is an over-reaction.</p> <p>Handicapped on his hurdles form, <strong>Dot Or Feather (3.40)</strong> is an ex-pointer who stepped up when allowed to race over fences last time, winning an amateur riders' race on New Year's Day at Fakenham. He's 5lb higher on Sunday, which should allow him to be seriously competitive, and is 4-1.</p> <p><a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings\" title=\"\">Click here for all the day's racecards, form, stats and results</a>.</p> <p>And post your tips or racing-related comments below.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Manifesto for a Model Mayor is an opportunity for Guardian readers to take part in an exciting exercise in open journalism and have a major input into our coverage of the biggest political event of the year \u2013 the fourth election for the British capital's executive mayor. Campaigning is, of course, already under way: the two frontrunners, Conservative incumbent Boris Johnson and his Labour challenger and two-times former mayor Ken Livingstone, have been hurling verbal missiles at each other for months. Brian Paddick for the Liberal Democrats, Jenny Jones for the Greens, Lawrence Webb of Ukip and the independent Siobhan Benita are among the others in the race. In the next few weeks they will begin publishing their promises and plans for exercising mayoral power in the key areas of transport, policing, housing, the environment, culture, the capital's economy and more. My modest pledge is that the Manifesto for a Model Mayor will leave these prospectuses cowering meekly in the shade. But fulfilling that pledge depends on you. The project won't be a success unless it is richly informed by the input of Comment is Free readers and followers of my London blog. The great thing about open, online journalism is that it teaches journalists a thing or two. Since the activities of the city's mayor became my professional territory four years ago, I've learned a huge amount about London, its pleasures and its pain, from contributions \"below the line\". I've often wished I could spend more time with these. Manifesto for a Model Mayor is an opportunity for me in that sense, too. This is where the knowledge and wisdom of constructive commenters is absolutely essential to making the manifesto \u2013 our manifesto \u2013 hit the mark. The first part of the Model Mayor project will be a crowdsourcing exercise conducted over the next fortnight. Starting on Monday, I'll be supplying a short article on each of 10 policy areas over which the mayor has power or influence. These will include three on separate aspects of London's transport system, where the office's responsibilities and ability to affect change are greatest. Each article will seek to frame the debate, stimulate readers and, of course, enlighten me. The 10 policy pieces will be launched at 11am each weekday for the next two weeks, starting with public transport. I will be at my desk responding to commenters until at least noon each day. Fresh thinking will be particularly welcome. Abuse, cheap point-scoring and general trolling will be even less welcome than usual. Later in the day, a colleague in the office will give the best contributions extra prominence by adding them to the end of the main article. Now here's an important point: if you're not a Londoner, please, please, please don't feel excluded. I'm aware, of course, that the Guardian has a national and indeed global readership, and that there is human life outside the capital, despite the impression the media sometimes give. However, the London mayoral contest has implications far beyond London. For one thing, its outcome of the will strongly affect morale in national politics: a Labour win would put fresh wind in Ed Miliband's sails and a Tory loss would be a blow to David Cameron. Furthermore, London since 2000 has been a testing ground for big city mayors. On same day \u2013 3 May \u2013 that Londoners go to the polls, the citizens of 11 English cities, including Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle, will vote in referendums to agree or disagree with the government's belief directly elected, executive mayors provide, \"the strong, visible leadership that will help them prosper nationally and internationally.\" Liverpool has decided to go ahead without such a vote. Leicester has adopted the system already. There's also the issue of London's status as, to quote the current mayor, \"the engine of the UK economy\". Is it right or wise that the capital is such crucible of growth and wealth-generation compared with other great British cities? For all our sakes, how much bigger can or should London become? We'd love to hear your views on any of those big questions about urban life and policy. Once the crowdsourcing phase is complete, I'll disappear from view, absorb your fabulous ideas and write the manifesto. Don't worry: I won't be declaring myself a candidate, not even as a stunt. My sole aim is to produce a set of proposals that combine originality, idealism and practicality into a philosophically coherent vision for the future of one of the world's most prominent mega cities. (That may not sound like much, but I hate to over-promise.) I anticipate a finished document of between 20,000 and 25,000 words, structured around a small group of key themes to be published by the Guardian as a handsome online document. It will draw on ideas found across the political spectrum, but it won't be a scorecard of the real candidates. In fact, I doubt it will even mention them. My hope is that, unlike most political manifestos, it will be fun to read. I'd love you to agree. After all, the Manifesto for a Model Mayor is going to be your manifesto, too. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

However, the London mayoral contest has implications far beyond London.</p> <p>For one thing, its outcome of the will strongly affect morale in national politics: a Labour win would put fresh wind in Ed Miliband's sails and a Tory loss would be a blow to David Cameron.</p> <p>Furthermore, London since 2000 has been a testing ground for big city mayors. On same day \u2013 3 May \u2013 that Londoners go to the polls, the citizens of 11 English cities, including Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle, will vote in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/27/elected-mayor-referendums-local-politics\" title=\"\">referendums</a> to agree or disagree with the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/2085395\" title=\"\">government's belief</a> directly elected, executive mayors provide, \"the strong, visible leadership that will help them prosper nationally and internationally.\" Liverpool has decided to go ahead without such a vote. Leicester has adopted the system already.</p> <p>There's also the issue of London's status as, to quote the current mayor, \"the engine of the UK economy\". Is it right or wise that the capital is such crucible of growth and wealth-generation compared with other great British cities? For all our sakes, how much bigger can or should London become? We'd love to hear your views on any of those big questions about urban life and policy.</p> <p>Once the crowdsourcing phase is complete, I'll disappear from view, absorb your fabulous ideas and write the manifesto. Don't worry: I won't be declaring myself a candidate, not even as a stunt. My sole aim is to produce a set of proposals that combine originality, idealism and practicality into a philosophically coherent vision for the future of one of the world's most prominent mega cities. (That may not sound like much, but I hate to over-promise.)</p> <p>I anticipate a finished document of between 20,000 and 25,000 words, structured around a small group of key themes to be published by the Guardian as a handsome online document. It will draw on ideas found across the political spectrum, but it won't be a scorecard of the real candidates. In fact, I doubt it will even mention them. My hope is that, unlike most political manifestos, it will be fun to read. I'd love you to agree. After all, the Manifesto for a Model Mayor is going to be your manifesto, too.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A Catholic church leader has called the government's plans for gay marriage \"madness\" and a \"grotesque subversion of a universally accepted human right\". Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the leader of the Catholic church in Scotland, also accused the coalition of trying to \"redefine reality\". In an article for the Sunday Telegraph, he says the prime minister is a \"passionate\" advocate of the change and told his party two years ago he supported gay marriage \"because I am a Conservative\". O'Brien wrote: \"Since all the legal rights of marriage are already available to homosexual couples, it is clear that this proposal is not about rights, but rather is an attempt to redefine marriage for the whole of society at the behest of a small minority of activists. \"Same-sex marriage would eliminate entirely in law the basic idea of a mother and a father for every child. It would create a society which deliberately chooses to deprive a child of either a mother or a father. \"Other dangers exist. If marriage can be redefined so that it no longer means a man and a woman but two men or two women, why stop there? Why not allow three men or a woman and two men to constitute a marriage, if they pledge their fidelity to one another?\" The cardinal has added his voice to those of leading figures in the Coalition for Marriage, a group of bishops, politicians and lawyers opposed to the changes. The group's supporters include Lord Carey, the former archbishop of Canterbury. He urges people to respond to the government's consultation on the proposals by signing a petition in support of traditional marriage. Earlier this week the Home Office defended the plans after the Tory MP Peter Bone called them \"completely nuts\". A Home Office spokeswoman said the government believed that \"if a couple love each other\" and want to commit to a life together they should \"have the option of a civil marriage irrespective of their sexual orientation\". The equalities minister Lynne Featherstone is due to launch a consultation on the plans later this month. Margot James, the first openly lesbian Conservative MP, criticised the \"apocalyptic language\" used by the cardinal and accused him of \"scaremongering\". She told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: \"I think it is a completely unacceptable way for a prelate to talk. \"I think that the government is not trying to force Catholic churches to perform gay marriages at all. It is a purely civil matter.\" She added: \"I think this sort of scaremongering is what it is, it is just scaremongering.\" Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman, said she hoped the comments would not end up \"fuelling or legitimising prejudice\". She told the Andrew Marr Show: \"We have had prejudice, discrimination and homophobia for hundreds of years. That doesn't make it right.\" \"I don't want anybody to feel that this is a licence for whipping up prejudice.\"",

I read this book before I knew about the Adventures of Tom Sawyer which you should really read first. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the book, but it is worth reading it first as it is easier. Some parts of the book were exciting and I couldn't wait to find out what happened next but other parts did get a big tedious and dragged on and on.

      "bodyText": "Not for the first time, David Haye \u2013 still without a licence, still to report to Munich police for questioning over his part in the brawl with Dereck Chisora \u2013 says Vitali Klitschko has \"finally agreed to fight me\". Klitschko outpointed Chisora to keep his WBC heavyweight title two weeks ago and was ringside in D\u00fcsseldorf on Saturday to watch his brother, Wladimir, defend his three versions of the title with a fourth-round stoppage of the over-matched Frenchman Jean-Marc Mormeck, whom Haye knocked out to win the cruiserweight title five years ago. The semi-retired former WBA champion tweeted before the fight: \"Vitali has just finally agreed to fight me in a live RTL interview!!! He told me I will be his next fight!! Let's Get Ready To Rumble!!!\" The only rumbling Haye has done in the immediate vicinity of the Klitschkos recently was on the floor with Chisora, but Vitali told Sky: \"Yes I would be happy to fight David Haye. I understand David Haye had to defend himself. It's not just street fighting. It's very important to have respect.\" The Klitschko brothers' manager, Bernd B\u00f6nte, had said after the Chisora fight that Haye was not in the picture to challenge Vitali. It was his exchange with Haye \u2013 who attended the post-fight press conference with a media pass provided by RTL \u2013 that led to the fracas. Haye has yet to get his British licence back after announcing his retirement on his 31st birthday last year, claiming he was fulfilling a personal pledge he had made 10 years earlier and that he would not change his mind. He did soon enough. He had not done himself justice in losing tamely on points to Wladimir last July, attracting widespread scorn for using a bruised little toe as an excuse. When Vitali then said he wanted to fight Haye, his interest in fighting again was roused. However, this fight remains as tough to put together as it ever was, perhaps more so. B\u00f6nte told Sky on Saturday: \"No, nothing has been agreed.\" The British Boxing Board of Control are due to talk to Chisora on 14 March about his behaviour before and after the Klitschko fight, but cannot interview Haye until he is licensed. If they do grant him a licence, it is unlikely to be without a suspension and heavy fine. Haye could apply for a licence in another country, which he has indicated he is prepared to do, but that would also be a contentious issue in Germany with the police investigation ongoing. The German police do not look kindly on professional boxers getting involved in public order offences and two German champions, Graciano Rocchigiani and J\u00fcrgen Br\u00e4hmer, served time there for assault. So Twitter will be buzzing again with rumours and theories. The real talking will be done behind closed doors between B\u00f6nte and Haye's trainer Adam Booth, and there is bad blood between them. Booth, whose head was cut open when Haye wildly wielded a camera tripod in Munich, yelled abuse at B\u00f6nte before leaving the scene, not a good basis for negotiations, even in boxing. Dave Charnley, the \"Dartford Destroyer\", who was twice denied the world lightweight title by Joe \"Old Bones\" Brown in London in 1961, has died after a short illness, aged 76. Charnley was British, European and Commonwealth champion. Ring Magazine called the first Brown bout the fight of the year and said Charnley should have won the second.",

It was his exchange with Haye \u2013 who attended the post-fight press conference with a media pass provided by RTL \u2013 that led to the fracas.</p> <p>Haye has yet to get his British licence back after announcing his retirement on his 31st birthday last year, claiming he was fulfilling a personal pledge he had made 10 years earlier and that he would not change his mind. He did soon enough.</p> <p>He had not done himself justice in losing tamely on points to Wladimir last July, attracting widespread scorn for using a bruised little toe as an excuse. When Vitali then said he wanted to fight Haye, his interest in fighting again was roused.</p> <p>However, this fight remains as tough to put together as it ever was, perhaps more so. B\u00f6nte told Sky on Saturday: \"No, nothing has been agreed.\"</p> <p>The British Boxing Board of Control are due to talk to Chisora on 14 March about his behaviour before and after the Klitschko fight, but cannot interview Haye until he is licensed. If they do grant him a licence, it is unlikely to be without a suspension and heavy fine.</p> <p>Haye could apply for a licence in another country, which he has indicated he is prepared to do, but that would also be a contentious issue in Germany with the police investigation ongoing.</p> <p>The German police do not look kindly on professional boxers getting involved in public order offences and two German champions, Graciano Rocchigiani and J\u00fcrgen Br\u00e4hmer, served time there for assault.</p> <p>So Twitter will be buzzing again with rumours and theories. The real talking will be done behind closed doors between B\u00f6nte and Haye's trainer Adam Booth, and there is bad blood between them. Booth, whose head was cut open when Haye wildly wielded a camera tripod in Munich, yelled abuse at B\u00f6nte before leaving the scene, not a good basis for negotiations, even in boxing.</p> <p>Dave Charnley, the \"Dartford Destroyer\", who was twice denied the world lightweight title by Joe \"Old Bones\" Brown in London in 1961, has died after a short illness, aged 76. Charnley was British, European and Commonwealth champion. <em>Ring Magazine</em> called the first Brown bout the fight of the year and said Charnley should have won the second.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",

The kiss that marks an even more profound change is that which over the past few years has been shared in moments of sporting glory by heterosexual males on the football pitch. Such behaviour from a sport noted for its vicious anti-gay sentiments is having a far wider impact as Eric Anderson, a university lecturer in sociology, discovered when he interviewed 145 university students. The vast majority said they were happy to kiss another man on the lips in friendship \u2013 an attitude reflected in research in the US and in other cities in the UK. That finding has now been taken further by Anderson's former PhD student, Mark McCormack, a sociologist at Brunel University in London. He spent a year in three diverse secondary schools, including a faith school, for his book The Declining Significance of Homophobia, published next month. In the book, he charts how prejudice and discrimination have markedly declined among young people, replaced by genuine affection and respect between pupils whether gay or straight. \"Many young people see 'gay' as normal,\" Dr McCormack says. \"It's the politicians and institutions who are slower to change.\" The speed of acceptance is remarkable.

Social networking sites have also played a part in reducing isolation and, as the closet has become more sparsely populated, everyone knows someone who is gay or bisexual.

Beneath their fancy garb and refined interval chitchat, their criticism turns out to be no more civil than the noisy opprobrium that fills football stadiums. I'm referring to the ruckus at the Royal Opera House, where fans greeted a modern-dress (if dress is indeed the right word) staging of Dvor\u00e1k's Rusalka with walkouts, jeering and, yes, booing. The opera retells a rather cloying little folk tale, so it probably didn't help that the directors set it in a brothel replete with warbling hookers. Yet opera-goers have a loud and proud history of vocalising their displeasure. Back in 1875, they even booed Monsieur Bizet out of the theatre when he premiered that hum-along hit of his, Carmen. It's not that other genres of music are immune. The premiere of Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring always leaps first to mind \u2013 boos yielding to fistfights and finally a full-blown riot. Then there's Britney, Rihanna, Lou Reed \u2013 all have been booed in the past 12 months. Still, it hasn't become a part of the culture in quite the same way. Is it just that opera's fatal loves and losses and leaps make us behave \u2013 well, operatically? Does it have something to do with the giddying price of tickets? It's tempting to suggest that the higher the art form, the lower the manner in which an audience will express its discontent, but that would be failing to take stand-up comedy into account. Aside from panto, which doesn't count, the only time I've ever booed is at a comedy club. It's not that I haven't wanted to boo, but like most, I tend to consume my culture as books or on a screen or through earphones. Marginalia, a snarky anonymous review on some movie site \u2013 they just don't cut it. Nor would vandalism in an art gallery. In the theatre, curtain calls offer more scope for a full-lunged expression of displeasure, though the rarity of appearances by directors and writers mean you risk misdirecting your scorn. Let's be clear \u2013 booing is not pleasant, and having once shared a stage with a booed poet, I know as much as I want to about that. And yet booing is also a sign of caring, honest: it's a sign of direct and passionate engagement that returns us to art's roots. The practice of booing performers stretches back to ancient Greece, where tragedians competed annually at the Dionysia festival. Eventually, audience participation became a civic duty. Booing was also part of life \u2013 and death \u2013 in ancient Rome's gladiatorial games, whose audiences helped determine a competitor's fate. As that poet acquaintance of mine will tell you, art is, in its way, a blood sport. Likewise, it's our responsibility as an audience to appraise, not merely soak up. Applause must be earned. An appropriately placed boo can be a rebellion against some of the more waffly ideas circulating in the cultural scene \u2013 the notion that any book which gets people reading is a good thing, for instance, or Brit Art's shoulder-shrugging claim that the artist's sole responsibility is to get a response, no matter what. Though this is a newspaper column and makes zero claims to be anything approaching art, I encourage you to treat it as practice. Rather than anonymously hitting the comment section, take a deep breath and bellow your boo out loud.",

Mannequins in size 12 and above (which have seen a 16% increase in sales to the UK's clothing chains) are being reported as \"Adele-sized\". Some background: there's a singer called Adele, who everyone says they love because, as well as having a nice voice, she's a size 16. She's a \"plus-sized\", \"shapely\", \"real woman\" who, by \"embracing her curves\", is responsible for a \"return to the fuller figure\". All phrases painted sloppily in shades of tact, like badly Ronsealed fences. All phrases that underline the reality that Adele looks different from the celebrities usually thrust our way. Phrases that attempt to deal with our shock that, despite the fact she can't get her hands around her waist, she seems\u2026 happy. There are rules to these conversations, rules that become clear only when they're broken. There was uproar when Karl Lagerfeld said Adele was \"a little too fat\". Uproar that ignored the fact the comment came from a man who (while a fabulous performance artist, with his 70 iPods and love of escorts) long ago proved he was a far from sane voice in fashion. A man who lost 6\u00bdst in a year and today says he only eats chocolate \"with my nose\". So yes, a man whose opinion on weight we should perhaps just nod along to kindly. But while commentary on her \"fat\" is offensive, the discussion of Adele's body with words like \"curvy\" (there's a whole language in which women's magazines talk about size 16s) is seen as \"liberating\", \"positive\", a concept to be returned to again and again like a hand to a Pringles tube. The thing is, it's the same conversation. Whether it's Karl spitting expensively about fatness, or a well-meaning editor hooraying Adele's \"womanliness\", it's a conversation that uses one young woman's body to teach us how to change our own. It's the same journey, but in different vehicles. Whether you call her \"fat\" or \"shapely\" you end up in the same place, equally exhausted. At times it feels like these discussions are simply women making sense of the fact that, despite everything we've been taught (about fat representing laziness, poverty, stupidity), we think Adele is wonderful. We stand, baffled, blinking into the sun, stuttering: \"But\u2026 but\u2026\" And inevitably, as is the way when a \"larger lady\" does well, her weight gets fashionised. Mannequin manufacturer Jim Moody tells us: \"Curves are back and set to stay this spring-summer.\" Thanks for the heads-up, Jim! I'll just dust off my spare tits! Grazia recently told us the same thing (referring to Cheryl Cole's imperceptible weight gain) and the Sun offered Christina Hendricks's bosom as proof again that \"curves are back\", noting that standing next to her, Sarah Jessica Parker looked \"somewhat\u2026 masculine\". Is this how we've learned to justify the success of people who aren't thin? By treating their weight as an accessory? As if Adele's body is a Prada dress she's slipped into for awards season, rather than \"her\". The place she lives. What makes me particularly angry about the appropriation of Adele by fashion magazines and mannequin makers is that (aside from the fact that few retailers are actually making plus-sized clothes, or even the simple oversight that the shop dummies aren't actually \"Adele-sized\", whoops) these potentially positive observations about body image and celebrity are simplified to the point where they become muddy and damaging. Whether the trend is thinness or fatness, we should not be encouraging each other to change our body shapes for fashion. For one thing, it's impossible.

I'll just dust off my spare tits! <em>Grazia</em> recently told us the same thing (referring to Cheryl Cole's imperceptible weight gain) and the <em>Sun</em> offered Christina Hendricks's bosom as proof again that \"curves are back\", noting that standing next to her, Sarah Jessica Parker looked \"somewhat\u2026 masculine\". Is this how we've learned to justify the success of people who aren't thin? By treating their weight as an accessory? As if Adele's body is a Prada dress she's slipped into for awards season, rather than \"her\". The place she lives.</p> <p>What makes me particularly angry about the appropriation of Adele by fashion magazines and mannequin makers is that (aside from the fact that few retailers are actually making plus-sized clothes, or even the simple oversight that the shop dummies aren't <em>actually</em> \"Adele-sized\", whoops) these potentially positive observations about body image and celebrity are simplified to the point where they become muddy and damaging.</p> <p>Whether the trend is thinness or fatness, we should not be encouraging each other to change our body shapes for fashion. For one thing, it's impossible. However many pounds we lose or put on, these are our bodies, our bones \u2013 we know that we'll usually end up exactly where we began. Mannequins can change, but our bodies really can't.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Letizia Battaglia returned to Palermo in 1974 from a three-year sojourn in Milan, the city was enjoying a period of relative calm. There was the endemic corruption, obviously, and the usual posse of self-serving politicians. But no one was expecting a bloodbath, least of all Battaglia. She was already a 40-year-old mother of three, enjoying her first steady job as picture editor of a city newspaper. She wasn't looking to cover a war. But war, it seemed, had decided to come looking for her. Sitting at a low table in her eighth-floor apartment in Palermo, Battaglia, now 76, flicks through some of the iconic images she captured during what Italians call the anni di piombo, the years of (flying) lead. Eighteen years in which the ferocious Corleonesi mafia clan would claim the lives of governors, senior policemen, entire mafia families and, ultimately, two of Battaglia's dearest friends: the anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. This May marks the 20th anniversary of Falcone's assassination by a massive motorway bomb, which also killed the husband of Rosaria Schifani, one of Falcone's bodyguards. In the intervening years the big drug-trafficking wars have shifted, on a blood meridian, from Sicily to the Mexican border. But Battaglia's photographs testify that nothing has changed, that none of this is new. The techniques pioneered by the Corleonesi have proved their efficacy. Maximum violence. Total extermination of your rivals. Intimidation of the state. If horror still lurches reliably out of Battaglia's pictures, so do the more complicated emotions of pity and despair. To many, these are the qualities that elevate them to the status of art. Battaglia's reputation has steadily risen over the years, attracting awards and exhibition space as far afield as New York and Amsterdam. But long before the foreign prizes and plaudits arrived, she'd already received domestic recognition of a more heartfelt kind: death threats. That Battaglia ignored the threats, despite being advised to lie low by Falcone himself, comes as no surprise once you've met her. At first she puts you at ease with her husky laugh and friendly little dog, Pippo. Her apartment is dark and cool, the walls adorned with two of her more soothing photographic portraits: a girl, and a dove. Further along is a framed Red Flag (it's from India, sent by a daughter), which seems in keeping with Battaglia's bohemian dress and 60s fringe. Beyond the bookshelves is a balcony, its tiles and pot plants shining in the summer sun. Framed by the door the view could almost be a photo, a sanitised vision of the sunny present. But once her eyes have fixed on you, her intensity is revealed. Let your gaze drift down to your notebook when she is declaiming something and you are abruptly reprimanded. \"Look me in the eyes!\" She is deadly serious. She insists on being heard. She smokes a lot. During the height of the violence Battaglia would get called out at all hours of the day and night, and be on the scene of a murder, pushing through ghoulish crowds of onlookers, before the blood of the dead had begun to dry. It was unrelenting: they would find as many as seven bodies at a time. No sooner had she and her colleagues raced across town on mopeds to cover one killing, than they would receive news of another hit. \"Before you'd even dealt with the desperation and suffering of one murder, you were already on the way to another. More blood, more violence.\" But she didn't stop. This was never just a job. It was her duty as a citizen, she believed. And it showed. These urgent, often grainy shots were politics of the most incendiary kind. They were asking a question that no one at the time wanted, or dared, to hear: why? \"The worst thing was that we didn't understand at first where this inferno came from, she says. \"No one knew about the Corleonesi. No one was getting caught for these crimes. And they always killed the best people. The best judges, the best policemen, the best politicians. It took years to understand what was going on, thanks to the work of Falcone and the testimony of the pentito Tommaso Buscetta.\" Battaglia's inability to shield herself from the horrors she witnessed is still evident. At one point she shudders and asks me to put away a photo taken by her then-boyfriend and fellow photographer, Franco Zecchin. The photo in question has an almost surreal quality to it \u2013 three bored-looking young men slouch in the back of a bus, looking for all the world as if they haven't realised they're dead yet. However, Battaglia didn't only photograph corpses. She ranged across Sicily, taking in religious festivals, psychiatric hospitals, crumbling slums and aristocratic salons. The stars of her photos are often young women, quietly enduring their various predicaments. The compassion that shines out of these portraits dispels any doubts one might entertain while wading through the bloodier end of her catalogue. Her art is not exploitative \u2013 it is about exploitation. Though Battaglia describes her own childhood as serene, it was also suffocatingly cloistered. Palermo after the war was not a place for independent-minded girls and her father was possessive. He kept her locked up in the family home. \"I couldn't go out because men would bother me on the street, even at 11 years of age,\" she says. Life with her jealous father soon became intolerable and at the first opportunity she bolted, which in those days meant marriage \u2013 at the age of 16, to a prosperous older man who worked in the coffee business. Three children followed, but little happiness. Twenty-one years would pass before Battaglia finally mustered the courage to walk out. In a country where divorce was still illegal and feminism just a distant rumour, she installed herself and her daughters in the single room of an \"alternative\" household in Milan. She was penniless but free. Her family considered her ruined. In Milan she learned her craft as a photo-reporter and soon, despite her family's forebodings, she was enjoying success and all the other things she'd previously lacked in life: creativity, independence, intellectual friends. Among these was the Sicilian author Leonardo Sciascia. It was he who later wrote a catty article that labelled Borsellino as a \"professional of the anti-mafia\". The article was seized upon by the judge's enemies and used to isolate him. Five years later both he and Falcone were blown up by two separate bombs, one after the other. The judges knew it was coming. As Falcone said: \"It is my destiny to take a bullet from the mafia one day. The only thing I don't know is when.\" \"Sciascia was an adorable person, but he had an outdated idea of the mafia,\" Battaglia says. \"He made a mistake with that article, but I forgave him.\" As for Falcone and Borsellino, she has only praise. \"I have two photographs of each of us together, taken by my daughter. They are the most important photographs of my life. I was proud to know them. These two brave Sicilians died to defend us.\" But perhaps the most important friendship she made was with the maverick anti-mafia mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, with whom she served both on the city council and as a deputy in the regional parliament. \"Those were the most beautiful years of my life. Better than being in love, or having children.\" A price must be paid for this kind of political commitment. It was difficult for her daughters; it was difficult for her, too. When she bought an apartment in one of the roughest parts of town, intending to share the people's problems, she was repeatedly burgled under the eyes of her neighbours who, true to form, never saw a thing. A cynic might suggest this was a classic case of a communist intellectual showing solidarity with the masses, and the masses failing to reciprocate. But at least the thieves didn't steal her negatives. Battaglia's immense archive would provide sensational evidence when the former Italian prime minister Giulio Andreotti found himself in court answering charges of links to the mafia. Battaglia, years before, had taken a photo of him during a visit to Sicily which unwittingly showed him in the company of a mafioso. Despite this, the prosecution never succeeded in securing a conviction. It was a defeat for the anti-mafia movement, one of many. But despite the difficulties of winning cases such as these, Battaglia believes that the answer to defeating Cosa Nostra is deceptively simple. \"The mafia can be beaten, but only if people stop voting for dishonest politicians. It's no longer just a Sicilian problem. It's all over Italy.\" Battaglia no longer does reportage \u2013 \"I'm too old to keep walking the streets\" \u2013 but she regularly visits schools and attends anti-mafia events, however lost the cause may seem sometimes. Is this what people mean when they describe her as impegnata, involved? \"It means setting an example,\" she says. \"It means opposing the mafia in everything that I say and buy and eat. Every person that I meet, every gesture that I make, it's all connected to the need to liberate my country from the mafia.\" In a city like Palermo, where the vast majority of shops and businesses pay extortion money, that's not as easy as it sounds. In fact, Battaglia doesn't go out much any more, except in the morning to walk the dog. She avoids contact with the city's middle classes, deemed guilty of what she calls moral absenteeism. She admits: \"Palermo is a bit of a prison for me \u2013 it holds me down. Every now and then I need to get away. I even moved to Paris for a year and a half, but I couldn't help thinking about Palermo \u2013 despite all of its problems, its shit, its corruption, which is even worse now than it was before.\" These symptoms of embittered love will be familiar to anyone who has lived in Sicily for an extended period of time. The place is infuriating, self-destructive and very nearly hopeless, but you can't shake it off. As Battaglia's friend Sciascia once said: \"I hate and detest Sicily insofar as I love it, and insofar as it does not respond to the kind of love I would like to have for it.\"",

      "bodyText": "Walking through the forest, you become aware of another presence. For a while there's nothing there but birdsong and the odd drone of a distant plane. But in the occasional silences it becomes evident that something \u2013 several things \u2013 have been here before you. Every few yards, the earth has been gouged up and pushed aside, the leaves freshly dishevelled. At the base of the beech trees are long, raking scratches where some creature has ripped over the topsoil, looking for something beneath. Bluebell roots lie scribbled against the earth where they've been pulled up and cut through, and around the base of the larger trees are deep, pale craters, as if the forest had recently been surprised by a shower of small meteorites. The animals responsible for all this re-arrangement have long gone. They're nocturnal and nomadic, and their recent notoriety has made them shyer than usual. By day they retreat into the secret parts of the Forest of Dean and by night they move from place to place, rooting their way to subterranean treasure and \u2013 just as likely \u2013 an early grave. It isn't easy being a wild boar in Britain these days. Having been deliberately reintroduced a couple of decades ago, they've found themselves staring down the wrong end of our conflicting attitudes towards wildness. We wanted them because they once belonged here. We didn't want them because they're disruptive and piggish. We like them because they're charming and tasty. We don't like them because they're untidy. We're keen to take their picture, but we'd prefer them dead. Now, having settled in nicely, the wild boars find themselves accused of everything short of satanism. Walkers say they live in fear of boars attacking them or their dogs. Farmers complain of thousands of pounds' worth of damage done to crops, fences flattened, maize laid waste. Homeowners have their lawns dug up and their gardens destroyed. And many people fear what inevitably follows the boar: the poachers and the men with guns. Is it realistic to bring back an animal that hasn't lived in Britain since Henry VIII was out hunting? Are boars better managed by Defra and the Forestry Commission, or by private landowners with high ideals and land to spare? Should they be hunted, should they be farmed, and can they ever just be left to get on with being themselves? And what exactly do we want boar for? The beaver and the boar were both hunted to extinction in Britain more than 400 years ago, though elsewhere they continue to thrive \u2013 750,000 boar are killed each year in mainland Europe. In many areas, they have become a public menace: the city of Berlin culls 2,000 \"feral\" boars annually. Like foxes, boars have realised that there are excellent pickings to be had from the bins of urban Germans. Unlike foxes, they also have a habit of smashing through shop windows, rooting up football pitches or trashing cemetery grounds. Since a full-grown sow can weigh more than 150kg, they can be an intimidating presence, even if no wild boar will attack humans unless provoked. Most domestic pigs, bred and interbred over centuries, end up looking like office furniture, but a wild boar looks more or less like a pig ought to. They've retained their original shape \u2013 rounded back; sticky-up ears; long, delicate legs \u2013 as well as much of their individuality and intelligence. A mature sow is front-loaded: all power in the head and chest, a miniature Picasso bull. Back in the mid-1970s, a few farmers in southern England began importing wild boar from eastern Europe to farm for meat. After a while, some of those boars escaped. They were joined by boars dumped by illegal importers, set free by animal-rights activists or released by hunters for sport. By the millennium they were flourishing, particularly in areas such as the Forest of Dean that offered ideal conditions: rich, deciduous woodland, agricultural land nearby and the occasional bin to raid. Separate breeding populations established themselves in Kent, Sussex, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Scotland. Their fans cited their charm and their regenerative effect on the soil. Their detractors pointed to the havoc they could cause. Defra spent three years producing an \"action plan\" which established that the boars were in fact wild boar rather than pigs in fur coats, and laid the responsibility for dealing with them on local communities and landowners. They also maintained their classification as dangerous wild animals, a category that also includes Tasmanian devils, death adders and Brazilian wolf spiders. That classification means that owners must hold a licence for wild boar, and that owners or farmers can be prosecuted if their boars escape. In the Forest of Dean a cull was introduced \u2013 30 boars the first year, 60 the second, 122 in 2011. The only trouble is that no one, not the Forestry Commission, not Defra, not the scientists or the experts, has any idea how many animals are actually out there; despite the use of increasingly sophisticated military thermal- imaging equipment, no one has yet managed a definitive count. Talk to the landowners and hunters and there's a boar bristling behind every shrub. Talk to the foresters and there's only an oppressed handful remaining. Josh Theobald, head keeper on the nearby Lydney estate, has seen the boar at work. \"If they find something they like, they hammer hell out of it, snuffling and rooting, knocking up turf. Their nose looks soft, but they're hellish strong. They'll eat anything, pretty much. While I was trying to shoot one three years ago, it ate some corn out of a feed-hopper, a squirrel out of a trap and when I actually shot it, it was pulling up a tree root. I mean, they're impressive.\" Foresters describe watching families of boar push through ground that has been snowed over and frozen for several days, overturning the hard earth with their snouts as if it were soft as sand. \"They're always wallowing in mud \u2013 typical pig,\" says Theobald. \"When you shoot them, you get a puff of dust coming off them, because their coats are just full of soil. When they're rotavating, they're looking for earthworms, beetles, roots, but they'll eat meat, vegetables, maize \u2013 anything. That's obviously why they do so well. The ones we've shot have been in hellish good condition.\" There is no closed season for boar \u2013 no period during the year when shooting them is illegal \u2013 so they have the same legal and moral status as rabbits, pigeons and grey squirrels. \"The one I shot, it was huge,\" says Theobald. \"Eight and a half foot long hung up. It took four of us to lift it into a truck. There's a layer of fat about two inches thick all over, and when you shoot them it's a bit like shooting a concrete block \u2013 they are solid.\" And it's good meat? \"Oh, very good meat. I mean, everything we shoot, people are crying out for it.\" Anything shot on the Lydney estate gets tested for TB and trichinella worm and certified by Defra before being sold through an official game dealer. But others are not so scrupulous. With the increase in interest in boar comes a corresponding increase in poaching. Pepi Barrington, who breeds Irish water spaniels in the forest, is constantly aware of their presence. \"The number of boar has definitely gone down. That's not because of the FC [Forestry Commission], it's because of poachers. There's been so much publicity with Autumnwatch and Springwatch, and all these TV programmes that poachers come from far and wide.\" Barrington is as alarmed by the poachers as she is by the boars themselves. \"There will be poachers out tonight, I can guarantee it. I see the lights and the tyre tracks. The police know who they are, and they won't do anything. Unless it involves someone being injured, poaching is not high on their list of priorities.\" This isn't old-style stealing for the pot; it's large-scale killing to order, and the poachers aren't picky. They take all sizes and ages, including lactating females with young piglets. They'll also take roadkill. By the time FC rangers set out to a boar injured or killed in traffic accidents, the victims will already be in the back of a van on their way to a roasting pan. \"You used to see boar in broad daylight, but you don't much any more,\" says Barrington. \"Because they've been shot at a lot, harassed by people \u2013 all these bloody wildlife photographers, the place is crawling with people trying to photograph them \u2013 because of that they've gone into the thicker areas and they're becoming more and more nocturnal.\" Two of her dogs were attacked by a lone male boar a couple of years ago as she was walking through the woods. \"I'd just gone over a stile and all of a sudden this boar appeared from nowhere and shot past me. That's all I saw \u2013 this huge thing hurtling past with tusks. He went after two of the dogs \u2013 one of the Irish water spaniel bitches and the labrador. The spaniel turned round to look at me and the boar took a huge chunk out of her rear end. It got the labrador as well.\" Both have subsequently recovered, but Barrington now puts bells on all her dogs' collars, so a walk in the woods sounds like a stroll with a herd of Alpine goats. The problem, she thinks, \"is that the local community is so divided \u2013 some people think they're wonderful and that it's a great privilege to see this animal that was hunted to extinction. But people who actually use the forest find them quite dangerous.\" In other parts of Britain, anyone who has the inclination, space and the licence can bring in boar on their own land to farm or to run free. Paul and Louise Ramsay, who own the 13,000-acre Bamff estate in Perthshire, have spent the past decade on a wildlife regeneration scheme involving wild boar and Norwegian beaver. Back in 2002, two beavers were released on the estate, followed a few months later by six wild boars. They liked what they saw. And since both also had very specific exterior design requirements, they immediately embarked on an ambitious relandscaping plan for Bamff. Boars generally favour a Somme-style ambience, while beavers prefer a really large stage on which to work. In the decade since they arrived, both species have done their best to convert large areas of Bamff back from 18th-century parkland into late-Pleistocene swamp. The boar and the beaver coexist contentedly, the boar in fenced enclosures and the beaver busy with large-scale forestry operations and novelty woodwork. The boars like the beavers' new terraced ponds. \"They love to wallow, so they love wet muddy places,\" says Paul. It is the authorities who are less easily pleased. According to Louise, SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) now wants to remove all Scottish beavers. \"So I started a campaign called Save the Free Beavers of the Tay on Facebook.\" Paul laughs: \"We did get quite a lot of people. Not all of them interested in animals.\" Both Paul and Louise had always been interested in conservation and ecology, so when Paul was offered a few wild boar on a visit to the Scottish Borders a decade ago, he took the bait. \"I understood that I was getting three gilts \u2013 virgin females, I suppose you'd say. And then it turned out that far from being three gilts, there were six of them: three females, two males and an intersex.\" Intersex? Does he mean a hermaphrodite? \"Well, yes. It was slightly awkward, because this boar, which definitely thought of itself as the alpha male, would knock the other chaps off the job, but then he couldn't serve the females himself.\" Why not? \"He didn't have the equipment. He was also rather aggressive, so he got shot.\" Ten years later they now have around 80 boars in three separate large enclosures, fed once a day but otherwise left to themselves. Their meat is sold locally and online as joints, sausages and \"boargers\". The main issue is keeping them in. Boar will root under conventional fencing and electric wires can short out \u2013 so to begin with they did have problems with escapees. As Louise says: \"What we say to our neighbours is that if a boar does break out and they find them on their land, then they're more than welcome to shoot it and make it into sausages, because that seems a reasonable deal to us. But I think if people understand how to manage wild animals and they don't feed them or dysfunctionally hunt them, then humans not only can but must coexist, because the alternative is that we live in a monocultural desert.\" At the time wild boar were originally hunted to extinction, the British population was 6 million. Now it's 60 million. Since they've returned, they've behaved exactly as wild boar are supposed to behave; the clue, after all, was in the \"wild\" part. It's us \u2013 the dog walkers, the hunters, the poachers, the landowners, the government and the experts \u2013 whose behaviour has been divided and erratic. If we couldn't coexist with the boar 400 years ago, what makes us think we can now? And where, in this insatiable island, is there ever going to be space for something other than us? A little further down the road, Andrew Johnston has been farming wild boar as a full-time business for 17 years, and has 40 breeding sows on a hillside just outside Perth providing a steady supply of meat for the local market. A decade ago, he says, eating wild boar was a novelty; now it's part of our rising appetite for game. The meat is unexpected \u2013 not rich and porky but lean and very flavoursome, almost like venison. In Johnston's view, the British are getting a taste for it. \"There is a demand,\" he says, \"but it's specific. Mostly I get repeat customers who come to the farmers' market week in, week out. They want something better than normal pork, something more interesting.\" It was one of his boars, McQueen, which in 2002 escaped from a pen at the abattoir, swam the river, scampered across Dunblane golf course and, despite a full-scale hunt involving the emergency services, an armed-response team and a televised plea for McQueen's life by the actors Martin Shaw and Jenny Seagrove (\"This pig wants to live\"), evaded his captors and fled into the Highlands. \"I'm not sure where he ended up,\" says Johnston. \"But I suspect probably in someone's freezer.\" The boar facts Wild boar became extinct in the UK in the 17th century. There are thought to be between 500 and 1,000 animals in the UK currently. The biggest populations are in Kent, East Sussex and the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, with others in Devon, Bedfordshire, Dorset and Scotland. Adult boars can stand up to 1m tall at the shoulder, with adult males weighing up to 150kg. Both sexes have tusks. Female and young boars live in groups; fully grown males tend to be solitary. Sows give birth to litters of between five and seven piglets once a year. Boars should not be approached, as they can be dangerous, especially if guarding piglets. Following the extinction of wolves and lynxes in the UK, boars have no natural predators except humans.",

      "body": "<p>Walking through the forest, you become aware of another presence. For a while there's nothing there but birdsong and the odd drone of a distant plane. But in the occasional silences it becomes evident that something \u2013 several things \u2013 have been here before you. Every few yards, the earth has been gouged up and pushed aside, the leaves freshly dishevelled. At the base of the beech trees are long, raking scratches where some creature has ripped over the topsoil, looking for something beneath. Bluebell roots lie scribbled against the earth where they've been pulled up and cut through, and around the base of the larger trees are deep, pale craters, as if the forest had recently been surprised by a shower of small meteorites.</p> <p>The animals responsible for all this re-arrangement have long gone. They're nocturnal and nomadic, and their recent notoriety has made them shyer than usual. By day they retreat into the secret parts of the Forest of Dean and by night they move from place to place, rooting their way to subterranean treasure and \u2013 just as likely \u2013 an early grave.</p> <p>It isn't easy being a wild boar in Britain these days. Having been deliberately reintroduced a couple of decades ago, they've found themselves staring down the wrong end of our conflicting attitudes towards wildness. We wanted them because they once belonged here. We didn't want them because they're disruptive and piggish. We like them because they're charming and tasty. We don't like them because they're untidy. We're keen to take their picture, but we'd prefer them dead.</p> <p>Now, having settled in nicely, the wild boars find themselves accused of everything short of satanism. Walkers say they live in fear of boars attacking them or their dogs. Farmers complain of thousands of pounds' worth of damage done to crops, fences flattened, maize laid waste. Homeowners have their lawns dug up and their gardens destroyed. And many people fear what inevitably follows the boar: the poachers and the men with guns.</p> <p>Is it realistic to bring back an animal that hasn't lived in Britain since Henry VIII was out hunting? Are boars better managed by Defra and the Forestry Commission, or by private landowners with high ideals and land to spare? Should they be hunted, should they be farmed, and can they ever just be left to get on with being themselves? And what exactly do we want boar for?</p> <p>The beaver and the boar were both hunted to extinction in Britain more than 400 years ago, though elsewhere they continue to thrive \u2013 750,000 boar are killed each year in mainland Europe. In many areas, they have become a public menace: the city of Berlin culls 2,000 \"feral\" boars annually. Like foxes, boars have realised that there are excellent pickings to be had from the bins of urban Germans. Unlike foxes, they also have a habit of smashing through shop windows, rooting up football pitches or trashing cemetery grounds.</p> <p>Since a full-grown sow can weigh more than 150kg, they can be an intimidating presence, even if no wild boar will attack humans unless provoked. Most domestic pigs, bred and interbred over centuries, end up looking like office furniture, but a wild boar looks more or less like a pig ought to. They've retained their original shape \u2013 rounded back; sticky-up ears; long, delicate legs \u2013 as well as much of their individuality and intelligence. A mature sow is front-loaded: all power in the head and chest, a miniature Picasso bull.</p> <p><br>Back in the mid-1970s, a few farmers in southern England began importing wild boar from eastern Europe to farm for meat. After a&#xa0;while, some of those boars escaped. They were joined by boars dumped by illegal importers, set free by animal-rights activists or released by hunters for sport. By the millennium they were flourishing, particularly in areas such as the Forest of Dean that offered ideal conditions: rich, deciduous woodland, agricultural land nearby and the occasional bin to raid. Separate breeding populations established themselves in Kent, Sussex, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Scotland. Their fans cited their charm and their regenerative effect on the soil. Their detractors pointed to the havoc they could cause.</p> <p>Defra spent three years producing an \"action plan\" which established that the boars were in fact wild boar rather than pigs in fur coats, and laid the responsibility for dealing with them on local communities and landowners. They also maintained their classification as dangerous wild animals, a category that also includes Tasmanian devils, death adders and Brazilian wolf spiders. That classification means that owners must hold a licence for wild boar, and that owners or farmers can be prosecuted if their boars escape.</p> <p>In the Forest of Dean a cull was introduced \u2013 30 boars the first year, 60 the second, 122 in 2011. The only trouble is that no one, not the Forestry Commission, not Defra, not the scientists or the experts, has any idea how many animals are actually out there; despite the use of increasingly sophisticated military thermal- imaging equipment, no one has yet managed a&#xa0;definitive count. Talk to the landowners and hunters and there's a boar bristling behind every shrub. Talk to the foresters and there's only an oppressed handful remaining.</p> <p>Josh Theobald, head keeper on the nearby Lydney estate, has seen the boar at work. \"If they find something they like, they hammer hell out of it, snuffling and rooting, knocking up turf. Their nose looks soft, but they're hellish strong. They'll eat anything, pretty much. While I was trying to shoot one three years ago, it ate some corn out of a feed-hopper, a squirrel out of a&#xa0;trap and when I actually shot it, it was pulling up a&#xa0;tree root.

So when Southampton Solent University gave her an honorary doctorate, she was thrilled. For a start she got a set of robes \u2013 \"I fully intend to have the doctoral cap welded to my cranium\" \u2013 and threw a huge party; and there was also the satisfaction of knowing that her convict ancestor had set sail from nearby Portsmouth. Her robes are not the only evidence of posh honours in the study of the Hampstead home she shares with her husband, human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson, and their two children. There's also the Savoy clock, a memento of her time as writer-in-residence at the exclusive hotel. With a suite at her disposal and the liberty to create her own cocktail (\"Kathy Cassis\"), Lette describes it as the best four months of her life, despite the fact that \"the only thing I wrote was cheques, for champagne\". Luxurious though the Savoy is, it can't rival Bondi Beach, which explains the portrait over Lette's desk, painted by a friend to remind her of home. Abashed by the number of images of herself \u2013 photographs and caricatures decorate the walls \u2013 she explains that she doesn't have \"elephantiasis of the ego\" and keeps them here to avoid a more ostentatious display elsewhere. Mind you, she operates an open-door policy in her office, with visitors often popping in. Despite the fact that she's published 12 books, is plotting out a musical on her whiteboard and recently wrote the dialogue for Julian Assange for the 500th episode of The Simpsons, she points out that women must frequently battle against the chaos of domesticity to produce their work. Any mother, she suggests, who writes a novel should be awarded the Booker prize just for finishing it. And on that note, Susan Faludi's Backlash in hand, she takes a call on her stiletto phone.

Abashed by the number of images of herself \u2013 photographs and caricatures decorate the walls \u2013 she explains that she doesn't have \"elephantiasis of the ego\" and keeps them here to avoid a&#xa0;more ostentatious display elsewhere.

It illustrates the cotton-headed caprice that drives so much of our culture without saying a single word. In its honour, this week I would like to take a stand against another ludicrous invention, even more common in celebrity circles: the It bag. Obviously anybody remotely unstupid can see that handbags costing thousands of pounds are the powdered wigs and lead face paint of our age \u2013 they look ridiculous, but we don't acknowledge it. Of course, I understand the appeal of the classics: a Chanel 2.55 is basically jewellery and it's worth paying a bit more for better quality\u2026 but a three-grand satchel made of dead pythons that will date faster than Russell Brand now that his divorce has come through? No. Just no. It's time to sing the praises of the humblebag: beautiful toteables costing less than a human kidney. With that in mind, here are a few of my favourites from this season's accessory collections (pictured). Cost-per-wear and compliment-per-pound they're the best buys around. The Cambridge Satchel Company is an inspiring brand \u2013 a mother-daughter team who started their business from a kitchen table four years ago and now sell 1,500 of their schoolbags-with-a-twist every week. Handmade in Britain, they come in every colour of the rainbow. I love this lovely oxblood number. If you want to pay peanuts but don't want your bag to look cheap, go for something modestly proportioned, with a bit of structure (nothing gives the game away like baggy pleather). Try the laser-cut clutch from Asos. Whether you're an ethical shopper or not, it's impossible not to be charmed by Elvis &amp; Kresse's rather splendid box bag, made from recycled fire hose (especially when you learn that 50% of the profits from its sale go to charity). Zara is a great place to find stylish pieces that don't immediately announce their price tag (a no-no however much you're spending). This snake-trim satchel is a great example. At the designer-but-doable end of the spectrum is my absolute favourite British accessory brand, Lulu Guinness. It's not cheap by any means, but the quality of Lulu's work is second to none and her designs are inventive and delightful. So if you're looking for an investment purchase, this is it (I've been collecting her bags for 15 years and have yet to pass one on. Sorry, Oxfam). This season I'm coveting the Emily camera bag.

      "bodyText": "46 Brewer Street, London W1 (020 7096 2096). Meal for two, including wine and service, \u00a3120 Mele e Pere means \"apples and pears\" and, unwittingly, the name is apt, for there is a certain neither-one-thing-nor-the-other mood about the place. It is a prime central London restaurant, with a bill to match, which manages to deliver a neighbourhood vibe. It is a loose-limbed neighbourhood joint upon which the baggage of its West End location weighs heavily. You can eat some nice things here. But you can also eat things that make you wonder what they were thinking. I expected something a little more consistent. The chef, Andrea Mantovani, was previously head chef at Arbutus, a few streets over in Soho. There are a growing number of places like Arbutus turning up now, but when it arrived in 2006 (later to be joined by sister restaurants Wild Honey and Les Deux Salon) it was a low-key revelation: really good, classy food, with no stupid service flummery, lots of wines by the glass and half carafe and a bill that doesn't make you feel like you're paying off the national debt of a bankrupt Balkan nation. I am regularly asked to recommend a reasonably priced quality place, and invariably Arbutus and its siblings are on the list. Mele e Pere isn't quite ready to join them. Partly it's the space. The ground-floor, over-lit reception with its huge displays of glass apples and pears lends a little too much formality to the whole experience. It feels like arriving at an over-blinged private bank. Downstairs is a large basement room which is slightly hard and chilly, less in temperature than mood. The menu is, as the name suggests, Italian, but very much in a think-you-you-cope-with-us? sort of way. There is very little in the way of comfort food. Octopus, fennel and blood-orange salad or hand-chopped (raw) veal or grilled razor clams or tripe \u2013 which amounts to half the starters \u2013 are hardly crowd pleasers. From a list of what I imagine are supposed to be canap\u00e9s, deep-fried olives stuffed with a little chilli are a dense, ripe pleasure. Snails served in their shells in the bourguignon style, with pecorino and parsley, feel like a non sequitur. The crumbled Italian cheese does not give an Italian spin to this most French of dishes. A starter of sweet, soft, red Sicilian prawns with a fresh dice of carrots, tomatoes and onions gets a big thumbs-up. A tripe stew with grated parmesan is simply not all there. It has all the musky, deep stickiness that you get from long-braised cow's stomach, but the sauce is just too sugary. Tripe cooked like this needs a big, bold peppery kick and this didn't have it. (Simon Hopkinson makes a brilliantly fiery tripe stew; he once gave me a Tupperware box of it as a thank you for taking him on a review. Witness my wonderful life!) The one self-conscious lurch towards comfort was the appearance among the pasta dishes of that discredited old stager spaghetti alla carbonara, which these days you are more likely to find as a pasta option on a Pizza Hut menu, where it will slip effortlessly from mouth to the already furred linings of your arteries. I wanted to be reminded exactly why it could be a classic, and I wasn't, not quite. When you start picking around for the bits of crisped bacon as though they are a reward, something is up. It should be luscious, intense and, courtesy of the raw egg used to make the sauce, very rich. This was dry; Italian chefs have been shot for less. Another dish of rabbit with carrots and black olives had a great big depth of flavour, but was also, as bunny can be, dry in places. We finished with a warm, frothy zabaglione which lacked a boozy kick. Apple tart with cinnamon ice cream was better. Best of all was a single scoop of Amalfi lemon sorbet, a little dish of sunshine. With a couple of pear bellinis and a \u00a328 bottle of bog-standard Chianti we were staring at a \u00a3135 bill, which is a lot of money for a meal that does not leave you patting your tummy contentedly and giving thanks to the gods of Italian cooking. It's easy to see that the kitchen can do better than this, can be more reliable and pleasing. Frankly, it had better be all of those things, and soon, because it's trading in a very crowded, unforgiving market.

      "bodyText": "George Clooney has given an interview to the American gay magazine Advocate, stating that he doesn't care if people think he's gay. Actually, Clooney's language was saltier: he said he didn't \"give a shit\". He also said that he'd never wanted to make a point of denying the rumours, or make being gay seem like a bad thing. All nicely handled, but the \"George is gay\" rumours have been swirling for at least 15 years, and suddenly Clooney is ready to address them. What's he been waiting for? His appearance perhaps in the one-night-only reading of Dustin Lance's play, 8, about the legalisation of same-sex marriage (the hook for the Advocate article)? Then again, if people aren't gay, then why should they have to address such rumours at all? In fact, even if they are gay, why should they? What gives anyone, even other gay people, the inalienable \"right\" to know? Thus do we stumble and blunder into the thorny thicket of \"outing\" etiquette. It's long seemed to me that, for obvious reasons, there is a much stronger sense of \"ownership\" among gay people. It just wouldn't occur to most straights to stake a claim on someone else's heterosexuality. No one hisses: \"He/she's straight, you know\", with a knowing wink. Maybe we should start outing each other; maybe this would make being straight a lot more fun. (Though of course I'm just being facetious.) If heterosexuals had to fight for basic rights, or were beaten up just for their sexual orientation, then things would be different. Clearly, for many gay people, outing is a deep-rooted impulse, born of a social history of enforced invisibility, shame, abuse, prejudice, and all shades of disenfranchisement. Similarly, the ability to spot other gay people, the infamous gaydar, was once a crucial tool \u2013 get it wrong, and you'd risk everything from social disgrace and imprisonment, to injury, even death. However, what has any of this got to do with 2012 and George Clooney? Or indeed Whitney Houston, whose corpse was barely cold before it was being pronounced \"lesbian\"? There is also the small matter that the universal gaydar can't get it right every time. For his sins, Clooney dealt gracefully with a nigh on impossible situation: what is a non-homophobic straight person supposed to do? Everyone knows that a person never looks gayer than when they're denying being gay. However, I cannot remember a single incident when a wrongly \"accused\" heterosexual was apologised to. Even if a celebrity is gay, there seems no real reason for these public bloodings. Indeed, while once these incidents might have served a purpose in making homosexuality visible and credible, one has to wonder what this constant stream of celebrity outings is achieving today. And wonder if, in fact, it's now just a shallow indulgence. It seems to me that, while \"out and proud\" homosexuality looks infinitely preferable to the closeted variety, it might be time to shift focus away from ruthlessly emptying said closet of every last public figure \u2013 from quaking boyband member to sequined diva. It also seems rather dubious for committed outers to continue to claim the moral high ground, when for the most part they seem merely obsessed with flushing out famous faces. Far away from all this glamour, hardly a week seems to go by without a lonely gay teenager committing suicide after being bullied for his sexuality. Then there are cases like the three men in Cameroon who, last year, were sentenced to five years' imprisonment, for engaging in gay sex. Indeed, 38 African nations are veering towards ever more severe penalties on homosexuality. But never mind that: is Clooney gay or not? Well, Clooney said he didn't \"give a shit\", and frankly neither should the rest of us. Even for a straight girl, there seem rather more pressing gay issues than whom a Hollywood actor or actress might be schtupping? It's douze points for whoever chose The Hump It's wonderful to hear that the UK entry for the Eurovision Song Contest is 75-year-old Engelbert Humperdinck \u2013 not only the show's oldest ever singer, but also the man with the greatest borrowed name in showbiz history. Someone must have thought: \"What we've been missing with our Eurovision bids are velvet suits, pomade and a man who looks like he knows his way around a beech-look Hostess trolley, with in-built martini shaker (circa 1974).\" Enter The Hump. This could be a shrewd move, in terms of the notoriously cliquey voting system (\"What, Norway, you're giving Sweden douze points yet again?\"). The Hump is \"well in\" with mainland Europe, having performed there during the years when Britain rudely decided to ignore him and his crooning bow-tied ilk, in favour of disco, punk, new wave, rap, R&amp;B, and the like. As Humperdinck famously kept the Beatles from the top spot with \"Release Me\", winning Eurovision should be a doddle even if he doesn't play the accordion, or wear national costume and knee-cymbals (big crowd pleasers on Eurovision). Let's hear it for The Hump \u2013 the man to restore national dignity after all that \"nul point\" unpleasantness. All this maths angst doesn't add up The charity National Numeracy says that almost half of the working-age population has the maths skills of a nine-year-old. Moreover, two million more adults have joined this category in the last decade. Before we start panicking about not being able to do our sums, it should be acknowledged that maths in primary schools in 2012 isn't along the simple lines of yesteryear. It can get quite complicated, with plenty of parents resorting to maths dictionaries (yeah, it was the first I'd heard of them, too) to deal with all the new terms and strategies. When there are parents' maths meetings at my daughter's school, all parents attend because they know that if they don't they'll be clueless for the entire term. So, if people haven't got a child doing maths in primary education, then it's probably not all that surprising that they struggle to answer new-style problems. My general take on maths is that, bizarrely for something so fretted over, it's not taken seriously enough. When maths goes beyond a certain learning-point, it stops being just another subject and becomes a genuine calling, the same as having a flair for a musical instrument. The good news is that navigating a course through adult life is more than possible with just the basics of maths. Most of us don't need much more maths than this to live rich and full lives. The lives of empty-headed simpletons, admittedly, but you can't have everything. So maybe some people have the maths skills of nine-year-olds because that's all they need. The real problem is that there will come a time when some of us find that we are too thick to help our real nine-year-olds with their maths homework.",

      "body": "<p>George Clooney has given an interview to the American gay magazine <em>Advocate</em>, stating that he doesn't care if people think he's gay. Actually, Clooney's language was saltier: he said he didn't \"give a shit\". He also said that he'd never wanted to make a point of denying the rumours, or make being gay seem like a bad thing.</p> <p>All nicely handled, but the \"George is gay\" rumours have been swirling for at least 15 years, and suddenly Clooney is ready to address them. What's he been waiting for? His appearance perhaps in the one-night-only reading of Dustin Lance's play, <em>8</em>, about the legalisation of same-sex marriage (the hook for the <em>Advocate</em> article)?</p> <p>Then again, if people aren't gay, then why should they have to address such rumours at all? In fact, even if they <em>are</em> gay, why should they? What gives anyone, even other gay people, the inalienable \"right\" to know? Thus do we stumble and blunder into the thorny thicket of \"outing\" etiquette.</p> <p>It's long seemed to me that, for obvious reasons, there is a much stronger sense of \"ownership\" among gay people. It just wouldn't occur to most straights to stake a claim on someone else's heterosexuality. No one hisses: \"He/she's straight, you know\", with a knowing wink. Maybe we should start outing each other; maybe this would make being straight a lot more fun. (Though of course I'm just being facetious.)</p> <p>If heterosexuals had to fight for basic rights, or were beaten up just for their sexual orientation, then things would be different.</p> <p>Clearly, for many gay people, outing is a deep-rooted impulse, born of a social history of enforced invisibility, shame, abuse, prejudice, and all shades of disenfranchisement. Similarly, the ability to spot other gay people, the infamous gaydar, was once a crucial tool \u2013 get it wrong, and you'd risk everything from social disgrace and imprisonment, to injury, even death.</p> <p>However, what has any of this got to do with 2012 and George Clooney? Or indeed Whitney Houston, whose corpse was barely cold before it was being pronounced \"lesbian\"? There is also the small matter that the universal gaydar can't get it right every time. For his sins, Clooney dealt gracefully with a nigh on impossible situation: what is a non-homophobic straight person supposed to do?</p> <p>Everyone knows that a person never looks gayer than when they're denying being gay. However, I cannot remember a single incident when a wrongly \"accused\" heterosexual was apologised to. Even if a celebrity is gay, there seems no real reason for these public bloodings.</p> <p>Indeed, while once these incidents might have served a purpose in making homosexuality visible and credible, one has to wonder what this constant stream of celebrity outings is achieving today. And wonder if, in fact, it's now just a shallow indulgence.</p> <p>It seems to me that, while \"out and proud\" homosexuality looks infinitely preferable to the closeted variety, it might be time to shift focus away from ruthlessly emptying said closet of every last public figure \u2013 from quaking boyband member to sequined diva. It also seems rather dubious for committed outers to continue to claim the moral high ground, when for the most part they seem merely obsessed with flushing out famous faces.</p> <p>Far away from all this glamour, hardly a week seems to go by without a lonely gay teenager committing suicide after being bullied for his sexuality. Then there are cases like the three men in Cameroon who, last year, were sentenced to five years' imprisonment, for engaging in gay sex.</p> <p>Indeed, 38 African nations are veering towards ever more severe penalties on homosexuality. But never mind that: is Clooney gay or not?</p> <p>Well, Clooney said he didn't \"give a shit\", and frankly neither should the rest of us. Even for a straight girl, there seem rather more pressing gay issues than whom a Hollywood actor or actress might be schtupping?</p> <h2>It's douze points for whoever chose The Hump</h2> <p>It's wonderful to hear that the UK entry for the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17222934\" title=\"\">Eurovision Song Contest is 75-year-old Engelbert Humperdinck</a> \u2013 not only the show's oldest ever singer, but also the man with the greatest borrowed name in showbiz history. Someone must have thought: \"What we've been missing with our Eurovision bids are velvet suits, pomade and a man who looks like he knows his way around a beech-look Hostess trolley, with in-built martini shaker (circa 1974).\" Enter The Hump.</p> <p>This could be a shrewd move, in terms of the notoriously cliquey voting system (\"What, Norway, you're giving Sweden douze points yet again?\"). The Hump is \"well in\" with mainland Europe, having performed there during the years when Britain rudely decided to ignore him and his crooning bow-tied ilk, in favour of disco, punk, new wave, rap, R&amp;B, and the like.</p> <p>As Humperdinck famously kept the Beatles from the top spot with \"Release Me\", winning Eurovision should be a doddle even if he doesn't play the accordion, or wear national costume and knee-cymbals (big crowd pleasers on Eurovision). Let's hear it for The Hump \u2013 the man to restore national dignity after all that \"nul point\" unpleasantness.</p> <h2>All this maths angst doesn't add up</h2> <p>The charity <a href=\"http://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/home/index.html\" title=\"\">National Numeracy</a> says that almost half of the working-age population has the maths skills of a nine-year-old. Moreover, two million more adults have joined this category in the last decade.</p> <p>Before we start panicking about not being able to do our sums, it should be acknowledged that maths in primary schools in 2012 isn't along the simple lines of yesteryear.</p> <p>It can get quite complicated, with plenty of parents resorting to maths dictionaries (yeah, it was the first I'd heard of them, too) to deal with all the new terms and strategies.</p> <p>When there are parents' maths meetings at my daughter's school, all parents attend because they know that if they don't they'll be clueless for the entire term. So, if people haven't got a child doing maths in primary education, then it's probably not all that surprising that they struggle to answer new-style problems.</p> <p>My general take on maths is that, bizarrely for something so fretted over, it's not taken seriously enough. When maths goes beyond a certain learning-point, it stops being just another subject and becomes a genuine calling, the same as having a flair for a musical instrument.</p> <p>The good news is that navigating a course through adult life is more than possible with just the basics of maths. Most of us don't need much more maths than this to live rich and full lives.</p> <p>The lives of empty-headed simpletons, admittedly, but you can't have everything.</p> <p>So maybe some people have the maths skills of nine-year-olds because that's all they need.</p> <p>The real problem is that there will come a time when some of us find that we are too thick to help our real nine-year-olds with their maths homework.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi, 59 years old, currently of Bani Gala village on the outskirts of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, is certain of many things. He is certain that \"a huge change\" is coming to his country. He is certain, too, that a \"revolution\" is on its way. And even if he does not state it explicitly, he is certain that he will, within eight months to a year, win a landslide victory in elections to become Pakistan's prime minister. \"When we are in power\", he says these days, not \"if we were in power\". When I arrive, Khan is sitting alone at a table in the garden of the house where he has lived since 2005. It is mid-afternoon, but the sun is low and the light is already fading. The house, built as a family home when he was still married to Jemima Goldsmith, sits on the crest of a ridge and commands a view of the foothills of the Himalayas, a large shimmering lake and the city of Islamabad. He is dressed entirely in black, working his BlackBerry. The house has become part of Khan's political persona. There is the short journey through the increasingly scruffy villages and then up to the beautiful hacienda-style house with the dogs, the lawns, the swimming pool and the view. There is the image of the politician who currently leads all polls in the country, looking down from his hilltop on the city and the power that he seems set to seize. The vision of the uncorrupt outsider eyeing the distant den of iniquity that he is set to purge is simply too neat to ignore. Consciously or otherwise, Khan does nothing to undermine the impression. He leads me briskly down to the edge of his land, steps up on to a large boulder overhanging the steep slope and points out the park which he saved from illegal development, and the new houses scattered across the shores of the lakes that are getting closer and closer to where we are standing. \"Look at it,\" he says angrily. \"There is no planning, no planning at all.\" He flings an arm out towards the serrated ridge of hills along the horizon. For, along with the certainty, there is righteous anger. This is directed at a number of different targets: a \"corrupt political elite\" who \"plunder\" Pakistan; strikes by American missile-armed unmanned drones against suspected Islamic militants near the Afghan frontier; the local \"liberals\" who condone the strikes; the lack of electricity crippling the country's economy; imperialists of old and neo-imperialists of today; the war on terror and its attendant human-rights abuses; multinational lending organisations; Washington; rich Pakistanis who avoid tax while their countrymen live in \"multi-dimensional deprivation\". In Pakistan today, certainty and anger make a potent mix. The country, chronically unstable if astonishingly resilient, is not only suffering ongoing extremist violence but also terrible economic problems which are steadily wiping out any gains in prosperity made in previous decades. Over recent months Khan has held a series of huge political rallies, with crowds numbering more than 100,000. In terms of popularity at least, Khan and the party he founded 15 years ago, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Pakistan Union for Justice), have made a major breakthrough. In the brutal world of south Asian politics \u2013 where dynasties, patronage and frequently sheer muscle count more than policies or public support \u2013 this is a genuine achievement. In 1999 I spent several days with Khan and his partyworkers on the campaign trail in eastern Pakistan. The headline on my pessimistic piece was: \"No Khan Do\". These days few would risk such glib assessments of Khan's electoral chances. The late 1990s, when Khan was making his political debut, were a raw time. The political scene in Pakistan was dominated by Benazir Bhutto, one of the most celebrated female politicians in the world, and her local rival, Nawaz Sharif. In 1999 the army stepped in through a bloodless and broadly popular coup. I saw Khan on and off occasionally over the subsequent years, but there was little to indicate that my earlier analysis was wrong. He was a legend in sporting terms \u2013 one of the best all-rounders in cricketing history \u2013 and increasingly well-thought of as a philanthropist, without doubt, but not a serious politician. A column in a local English-language political magazine relentlessly satirised the ambitions of \"Im the Dim\", and few disagreed. Now Bhutto is dead, assassinated on 27 December 2007 by Islamic militants, and the old guard of politicians who have survived her, including her husband Asif Ali Zardari, president since 2008, are detested. Khan says he could take over \u2013 democratically, of course \u2013 at any moment, but he is biding his time. \"We have the power to go out and block the government on any issue. But we will only have one chance and we have to be completely prepared.\" Back in the late 1990s, he tells me, politics was \"like facing a fast bowler without pads, gloves or a helmet\". Not any longer, he says. Khan was born on 25 November 1952 into a wealthy and well-connected family in Lahore, Pakistan's eastern city. Ethnically he is a Pashtun, or Pathan, as British imperialists called the peoples concentrated along what once was known as the North-West Frontier. Educated at Lahore's Aitchison College, one of the most exclusive schools in Pakistan, the Royal Grammar School in Worcester and Oxford University, his early years were typical of Pakistan's anglicised upper classes. Khan reminisces about how his family home, Zaman Park, was surrounded by fields and woodland where he used to hunt partridge. \"Now everything is built up; it's like living next to a motorway,\" he says. \"The air pollution, noise pollution\u2026 It is terrible.\" The shy teenager's precocious sporting talent took him rapidly into the national side: he made his Test debut against England in 1971, aged just 18. Eleven years later, after performances combining tenacity and flair, he was made captain of Pakistan. Khan's two autobiographies, All Round View (1992) and Pakistan: A Personal History (2010), both tell the story of his years as an international cricketer: the victories against the odds in front of the home crowd, the career-threatening injury overcome, the return from retirement at the age of 37, winning the World Cup \u2013 for the first and only time in Pakistan's sporting history \u2013 despite a ruined cartilage in his shoulder. It is only when in Pakistan, where the sport is a national passion, that the enormity of his sporting achievement is clear. Neither book is forthcoming about his activities off the pitch, however. A string of rich, well-connected, beautiful women earned him a reputation as a playboy. Then in 1995 he married Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of the late billionaire Sir James Goldsmith. Aged only 21, she converted to Islam and moved to Pakistan. The couple soon had two sons. \"I had always wanted to marry a Pakistani, but I realised while I was playing cricket that sport at that level and marriage were not compatible,\" he says. \"So I decided I'd only get married when I gave up sport.\" Khan twice announced his retirement: the first time, General Zia ul-Haq, then military dictator of Pakistan, persuaded him to reconsider, and the second time he returned to the team to help raise funds for Pakistan's first cancer hospital. His mother, to whom he wad been very close, had died of cancer in 1984 and in her memory he had decided to build a hospital which would offer free treatment to the poor. \"The whole board [of the hospital] said I needed to keep playing so they could raise money. So I carried on until I was 39, and by then I was too old for an arranged marriage. I just could no longer trust someone else to find someone for me. \"So I found it very difficult,\" Khan continues. \"The irony was I thought all the 25-year-olds were too young, and I was still looking when I met Jemima \u2013 and she was 21.\" The couple married in 1995 and divorced nine years later. \"It would have had a greater chance of working if I hadn't been involved in politics or she had been Pakistani. Or if she could have got involved in the politics with me.\" As one of his wife's grandfathers was Jewish, a noxious storm of abuse and conspiracy theories was unleashed. Pakistan is a country where antisemitism is so deep-rooted as to be remarkable only when absent. Local politicians targeted this \"weak spot\": spurious court cases, rabble-rousing editorials, underhand smears all contributed to make Pakistan a hostile environment for the young socialite heiress. The construction of the cancer hospital and the leadership of his party consumed most of Khan's funds and time. \"Because they attacked me and her, calling me part of the Jewish lobby, she couldn't get involved in politics and that was the beginning of it becoming more and more difficult. And she really gave it her best shot. I look back and think: could my marriage have worked? I think of the words of the prophet [Mohammed]: 'Don't fight destiny because destiny is God.' I believe the past is to learn from, not live in.\" He still gets on well with her family \u2013 when in London he stays with his former mother-in-law Lady Annabel Goldsmith \u2013 and has a \"fabulous relationship\" with his sons. A day or so after we meet, he is flying to London for three days for half term. \"It's very important to spend time together. Children really need a mother and a father. They have different roles, but both are very important. This idea of having two men as parents. It's a nonsense.\" Religion became important to Khan relatively late. He grew up, he says, surrounded by faith. His mother read him stories from the life of the Prophet Mohammed and at seven he was taught to read the Koran in Arabic by a visiting scholar. But as a young man, he was not devout. The return to faith came following his mother's illness and a profound personal interrogation, he says, prompted by the furore after the publication of Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses. Wanting to defend Islam from what he saw as ignorant attacks, Khan began to read more widely about the religion. These days his identity as a conservative, but not fundamentalist, Muslim has become part of his political programme and, in a way not often understood in the west, his political persona in Pakistan. Liberals in the country dismiss him as a mullah, literally a low-level cleric but figuratively an ignorant extremist, just, they say, without the beard that is the mark of the pious Muslim man. This, predictably, irritates Khan. His faith, he says, has been influenced primarily by the Sufi strand of Islamic practice, which emphasises a believer's direct engagement with God without the intercession of a cleric or scholar. Another major influence is Allama Iqbal, a poet, political activist and philosopher who died in 1938 and is considered one of the spiritual fathers of Pakistan. \"Iqbal, who is my great inspiration, clashes with the mullahs,\" says Khan. \"The message of all religions is to be just and humane but it is often distorted by the clergy.\" For all the talk of tolerance, Khan's party has been keeping some strange company recently, sharing a platform, for example, with the Difa-e-Pakistan or Pakistan Defence Council. This is a coalition of extremist groups which wants to end any Pakistani alliance with the USA and includes people who not only explicitly support the Afghan Taliban but who are associated with terrorist and sectarian violence. At one recent rally of the council in Islamabad, I met members of Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, a Sunni group which has murdered thousands of Shias, while around me hundreds chanted: \"Death to America.\" Lashkar-e-Toiba, the organisation responsible for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai in India in which 166 died, is also part of the coalition. Mian Mohammed Aslam, the head of the Jamaat-e-Islami, a mass Islamist party similar to the Muslim Brotherhood in the Islamic world and dedicated to a similarly hardline, conservative programme, spoke warmly of \"close relations\" with Khan, even going as far as raising the prospect of an electoral pact with Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf in the coming elections, when I interviewed him. Khan says that as a politician he and his party need to reach out to everybody, but that does not mean that he endorses the views of the Islamists. Undoubtedly a social conservative who is religious in outlook and rhetoric, he does not lapse into simplistic binary analyses of the west (secular or \"Crusader Christian\" against Islam) like many of his countrymen. He denies being anti-western at all. \"How can I be anti-western? How can you be anti-western when [the west] is so varied, so different? It doesn't make sense.\" It is not religion driving Khan's anger but something else. Take, for example, his analysis of the violent insurgency in the western borders of his country. For most scholars, this is the result of a complex mix of factors: the breakdown of traditional society, war in Afghanistan in the 1980s and the 2000s, the generalised radicalisation of the Islamic world since 2001, al-Qaeda's presence, the Pakistani army's operations in the area and the civilian casualties caused by drone strikes. The militants themselves, who behead supposed spies and drive out development workers or teachers, are increasingly unpopular. Yet Khan calls the violence a \"fight for Pashtun solidarity against a foreign invader\". He insists \"there is not a threat to Pakistan from Taliban ideology\". For Khan this foreign invasion takes various forms. There is dress (he speaks admiringly of how the Pashtuns still shun western clothes) and there is TV (he mentions how his former mother-in-law thought one channel beamed in from India was in fact American, because of all its adverts for consumer goods). His charge against the \"liberal elite\" is implicitly a charge against the most westernised elements in the country. It is a defence of a vision of the local, the authentic, the familiar, against globalisation. However, with his cultured public-school vowels, his half-British children, his British ex-wife, his success at a game the English invented, it becomes a very personal argument, too. Khan says he first became aware of the effects of colonialism as a teenager. \"My first shock was going from Aitchison to play for Lahore. The boys from the Urdu [local language] schools laughed at me\u2026 Then in England we had been trained to be English public schoolboys, which we were not. Hence the inferiority complex. Because we were not and could never be the thing we were trying to be.\" Even the memory agitates him. \"I saw the elite [in Pakistan] who were superior because they were more westernised. I used to hear that colonialism was about building roads, railways etc\u2026 but that's all bullshit. It kills your self-esteem. The elite become a cheap imitation of the coloniser.\" He says that he recently read that after 200 years of Arab rule in Sicily, the court continued to speak Arabic and wear Arab clothes for 50 years after their former overlords had left. His recent book is full of such references. P34: \"Colonialism, for my mother and father, was the ultimate humiliation.\" P43: \"The more a Pakistani aped the British the higher up the social ladder he was considered to be.\" P64: \"In today's Lahore and Karachi rich women go to glitzy parties in western clothes chauffeured by men with entirely different customs and values\" \u2013 and so on through the 350 pages. This lays him open to charges of hypocrisy, inconsistency, of being a self-hating \"brown sahib\" himself, accusations frequently made by the \"liberal elite\" Khan so detests. Yet Khan's patriotism, faith and honesty are attractive to many in a chronically unstable country seen as an exporter of extremism and violence, as irremediably corrupt, as \"the most dangerous place in the world\". So, what would Khan do in power? At the moment he is thick on aspiration and thin on practical policy. He would, he says, cut government expenditure and raise tax collection. He would turn the mansions and villas of senior officials \u2013 \"these colonial symbols\" \u2013 into libraries or even museums \"like after the Iranian revolution\" to show the people how the elite lived. He would solve the \"energy and education emergencies\" and he would \"totally pull out of the war on terror\", withdrawing the army from the western border zone and letting \"our people in [these areas] deal with the militants themselves\". Whether he could make the country's powerful military obey such directives \u2013 his critics allege he is unhealthily close to the army \u2013 is unsure. As for relations with Washington, his position is clear: \"We need to be a friend of American, but not a hired gun,\" he says. \"We will take no aid from them. We will stand on our own feet, with a fully sovereign foreign policy and no terrorism from our soil.\" Which political leaders does he admire? Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the moderate Islamist Turkish prime minister, he says; Brazil's Lula da Silva, who forced a better redistribution of his country's newly generated wealth; Mahathir Mohamad and Lee Kuan Yew of Malaysia and Singapore, two authoritarians. But it doesn't really matter. If Khan does end up prime minister he will do things his way. Khan is not \"dim\", as the elite who he detests contemptuously say, but is not an intellectual either. He is a politician riding a wave of public disaffection, and that wave might just carry him to power. What he does afterwards is not something he worries about. He will be 60 this autumn. This would only bother him, he says, if he \"had nothing to look forward to\". But he is convinced that he does. From his hilltop Khan looks down and says: \"This country will go through its biggest change ever. A revolution is coming.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2013. The original sub-heading wrongly referred to Imran Khan as a Pashtun aristocrat. This has been corrected.",

In 1999 the army stepped in through a bloodless and broadly popular coup. I saw Khan on and off occasionally over the subsequent years, but there was little to indicate that my earlier analysis was wrong. He was a legend in sporting terms \u2013 one of the best all-rounders in cricketing history \u2013 and increasingly well-thought of as a philanthropist, without doubt, but not a serious politician. A column in a local English-language political magazine relentlessly satirised the ambitions of \"Im the Dim\", and few disagreed.</p> <p>Now Bhutto is dead, assassinated on 27 December 2007 by Islamic militants, and the old guard of politicians who have survived her, including her husband Asif Ali Zardari, president since 2008, are detested. Khan says he could take over \u2013 democratically, of course \u2013 at any moment, but he is biding his time. \"We have the power to go out and block the government on any issue. But we will only have one chance and we have to be completely prepared.\" Back in the late 1990s, he tells me, politics was \"like facing a fast bowler without pads, gloves or a helmet\". Not any longer, he says.</p> <p>Khan was born on 25 November 1952 into a wealthy and well-connected family in Lahore, Pakistan's eastern city. Ethnically he is a Pashtun, or Pathan, as British imperialists called the peoples concentrated along what once was known as the North-West Frontier. Educated at Lahore's Aitchison College, one of the most exclusive schools in Pakistan, the Royal Grammar School in Worcester and Oxford University, his early years were typical of Pakistan's anglicised upper classes. Khan reminisces about how his family home, Zaman Park, was surrounded by fields and woodland where he used to hunt partridge. \"Now everything is built up; it's like living next to a motorway,\" he says. \"The air pollution, noise pollution\u2026 It is terrible.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-408143372\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/3/1/1330605229278/Imran-Khan-001.jpg\" alt=\"Imran Khan\" width=\"220\" height=\"352\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Special delivery: playing at Lord\u2019s in 1987. Khan made his Test debut against England in 1971 aged 18. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shy teenager's precocious sporting talent took him rapidly into the national side: he made his Test debut against England in 1971, aged just 18. Eleven years later, after performances combining tenacity and flair, he was made captain of Pakistan. Khan's two autobiographies, <em>All Round View</em> (1992) and <em>Pakistan: A Personal History</em> (2010), both tell the story of his years as an international cricketer: the victories against the odds in front of the home crowd, the career-threatening injury overcome, the return from retirement at the age of 37, winning the World Cup \u2013 for the first and only time in Pakistan's sporting history \u2013 despite a ruined cartilage in his shoulder. It is only when in Pakistan, where the sport is a national passion, that the enormity of his sporting achievement is clear.</p> <p>Neither book is forthcoming about his activities off the pitch, however. A string of rich, well-connected, beautiful women earned him a reputation as a playboy. Then in 1995 he married Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of the late billionaire Sir James Goldsmith. Aged only 21, she converted to Islam and moved to Pakistan. The couple soon had two sons.</p> <p>\"I had always wanted to marry a Pakistani, but I realised while I was playing cricket that sport at that level and marriage were not compatible,\" he says. \"So I decided I'd only get married when I gave up sport.\" Khan twice announced his retirement: the first time, General Zia ul-Haq, then military dictator of Pakistan, persuaded him to reconsider, and the second time he returned to the team to help raise funds for Pakistan's first cancer hospital. His mother, to whom he wad been very close, had died of cancer in 1984 and in her memory he had decided to build a hospital which would offer free treatment to the poor. \"The whole board [of the hospital] said I needed to keep playing so they could raise money. So I carried on until I was 39, and by then I was too old for an arranged marriage. I just could no longer trust someone else to find someone for me.</p> <p>\"So I found it very difficult,\" Khan continues. \"The irony was I thought all the 25-year-olds were too young, and I was still looking when I met Jemima \u2013 and she was 21.\" The couple married in 1995 and divorced nine years later. \"It would have had a greater chance of working if I hadn't been involved in politics or she had been Pakistani. Or if she could have got involved in the politics with me.\"</p> <p>As one of his wife's grandfathers was Jewish, a noxious storm of abuse and conspiracy theories was unleashed. Pakistan is a country where antisemitism is so deep-rooted as to be remarkable only when absent. Local politicians targeted this \"weak spot\": spurious court cases, rabble-rousing editorials, underhand smears all contributed to make Pakistan a hostile environment for the young socialite heiress.</p> <p>The construction of the cancer hospital and the leadership of his party consumed most of Khan's funds and time. \"Because they attacked me and her, calling me part of the Jewish lobby, she couldn't get involved in politics and that was the beginning of it becoming more and more difficult. And she really gave it her best shot. I look back and think: could my marriage have worked? I think of the words of the prophet [Mohammed]: 'Don't fight destiny because destiny is God.' I believe the past is to learn from, not live in.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-408143373\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/3/1/1330605397408/Imran-Khan-001.jpg\" alt=\"Imran Khan\" width=\"220\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'She really gave it her best shot': with his ex-wife Jemima on their wedding day in 1995. Photograph: Nils Jorgenson/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He still gets on well with her family \u2013 when in London he stays with his former mother-in-law Lady Annabel Goldsmith \u2013 and has a&#xa0;\"fabulous relationship\" with his sons. A day or so after we meet, he is flying to London for three days for half term. \"It's very important to spend time together. Children really need a&#xa0;mother and a father. They have different roles, but both are very important. This idea of having two men as parents. It's a nonsense.\"</p> <p>Religion became important to Khan relatively late. He grew up, he says, surrounded by faith. His mother read him stories from the life of the Prophet Mohammed and at seven he was taught to read the Koran in Arabic by a visiting scholar. But as a young man, he was not devout. The return to faith came following his mother's illness and a profound personal interrogation, he says, prompted by the furore after the publication of Salman Rushdie's <em>Satanic Verses</em>. Wanting to defend Islam from what he saw as ignorant attacks, Khan began to read more widely about the religion.</p> <p>These days his identity as a conservative, but not fundamentalist, Muslim has become part of his political programme and, in a way not often understood in the west, his political persona in Pakistan. Liberals in the country dismiss him as a <em>mullah</em>, literally a low-level cleric but figuratively an ignorant extremist, just, they say, without the beard that is the mark of the pious Muslim man. This, predictably, irritates Khan. His faith, he says, has been influenced primarily by the Sufi strand of Islamic practice, which emphasises a believer's direct engagement with God without the intercession of a&#xa0;cleric or scholar. Another major influence is Allama Iqbal, a poet, political activist and philosopher who died in 1938 and is considered one of the spiritual fathers of Pakistan. \"Iqbal, who is my great inspiration, clashes with the mullahs,\" says Khan. \"The message of all religions is to be just and humane but it is often distorted by the clergy.\"</p> <p>For all the talk of tolerance, Khan's party has been keeping some strange company recently, sharing a platform, for example, with the Difa-e-Pakistan or Pakistan Defence Council. This is a coalition of extremist groups which wants to end any Pakistani alliance with the USA and includes people who not only explicitly support the Afghan Taliban but who are associated with terrorist and sectarian violence. At one recent rally of the council in Islamabad, I met members of Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, a&#xa0;Sunni group which has murdered thousands of Shias, while around me hundreds chanted: \"Death to America.\" Lashkar-e-Toiba, the organisation responsible for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai in India in which 166 died, is also part of the coalition. Mian Mohammed Aslam, the head of the Jamaat-e-Islami, a mass Islamist party similar to the Muslim Brotherhood in the Islamic world and dedicated to a similarly hardline, conservative programme, spoke warmly of \"close relations\" with Khan, even going as far as raising the prospect of an electoral pact with Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf in the coming elections, when I interviewed him.</p> <p>Khan says that as a politician he and his party need to reach out to everybody, but that does not mean that he endorses the views of the Islamists. Undoubtedly a social conservative who is religious in outlook and rhetoric, he does not lapse into simplistic binary analyses of the west (secular or \"Crusader Christian\" against Islam) like many of his countrymen. He denies being anti-western at all. \"How can I be anti-western? How can you be anti-western when [the west] is so varied, so different? It doesn't make sense.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-408143374\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/3/1/1330605547400/Imran-Khan-001.jpg\" alt=\"Imran Khan\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finger on the pulse: speaking at a rally in Lahore last month. 'We only have one chance and we have to be completely prepared,' he says. Photograph: Warrick Page/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not religion driving Khan's anger but something else. Take, for example, his analysis of the violent insurgency in the western borders of his country. For most scholars, this is the result of a complex mix of factors: the breakdown of traditional society, war in Afghanistan in the 1980s and the 2000s, the generalised radicalisation of the Islamic world since 2001, al-Qaeda's presence, the Pakistani army's operations in the area and the civilian casualties caused by drone strikes. The militants themselves, who behead supposed spies and drive out development workers or teachers, are increasingly unpopular. Yet Khan calls the violence a \"fight for Pashtun solidarity against a foreign invader\". He insists \"there is not a threat to Pakistan from Taliban ideology\".</p> <p>For Khan this foreign invasion takes various forms. There is dress (he speaks admiringly of how the Pashtuns still shun western clothes) and there is TV (he mentions how his former mother-in-law thought one channel beamed in from India was in fact American, because of all its adverts for consumer goods). His charge against the \"liberal elite\" is implicitly a charge against the most westernised elements in the country. It is a defence of a vision of the local, the authentic, the familiar, against globalisation.</p> <p>However, with his cultured public-school vowels, his half-British children, his British ex-wife, his success at a game the English invented, it becomes a very personal argument, too. Khan says he first became aware of the effects of colonialism as a teenager. \"My first shock was going from Aitchison to play for Lahore. The boys from the Urdu [local language] schools laughed at me\u2026 Then in England we had been trained to be English public schoolboys, which we were not. Hence the inferiority complex. Because we were not and could never be the thing we were trying to be.\"</p> <p>Even the memory agitates him. \"I saw the elite [in Pakistan] who were superior because they were more westernised. I used to hear that colonialism was about building roads, railways etc\u2026 but that's all bullshit. It kills your self-esteem. The elite become a cheap imitation of the coloniser.\" He says that he recently read that after 200 years of Arab rule in Sicily, the court continued to speak Arabic and wear Arab clothes for 50 years after their former overlords had left.</p> <p>His recent book is full of such references. P34: \"Colonialism, for my mother and father, was the ultimate humiliation.\" P43: \"The more a Pakistani aped the British the higher up the social ladder he was considered to be.\" P64: \"In today's Lahore and Karachi rich women go to glitzy parties in western clothes chauffeured by men with entirely different customs and values\" \u2013 and so on through the 350 pages.</p> <p>This lays him open to charges of hypocrisy, inconsistency, of being a self-hating \"brown sahib\" himself, accusations frequently made by the \"liberal elite\" Khan so detests. Yet Khan's patriotism, faith and honesty are attractive to many in a chronically unstable country seen as an exporter of extremism and violence, as irremediably corrupt, as \"the most dangerous place in the world\".</p> <p>So, what would Khan do in power? At the moment he is thick on aspiration and thin on practical policy. He would, he says, cut government expenditure and raise tax collection. He would turn the mansions and villas of senior officials \u2013 \"these colonial symbols\" \u2013 into libraries or even museums \"like after the Iranian revolution\" to show the people how the elite lived. He would solve the \"energy and education emergencies\" and he would \"totally pull out of the war on terror\", withdrawing the army from the western border zone and letting \"our people in [these areas] deal with the militants themselves\". Whether he could make the country's powerful military obey such directives \u2013 his critics allege he is unhealthily close to the army \u2013 is unsure.</p> <p>As for relations with Washington, his position is clear: \"We need to be a friend of American, but not a hired gun,\" he says. \"We will take no aid from them. We will stand on our own feet, with a fully sovereign foreign policy and no terrorism from our soil.\"</p> <p>Which political leaders does he admire? Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the moderate Islamist Turkish prime minister, he says; Brazil's Lula da Silva, who forced a better redistribution of his country's newly generated wealth; Mahathir Mohamad and Lee Kuan Yew of Malaysia and Singapore, two authoritarians. But it doesn't really matter. If Khan does end up prime minister he will do things his way.</p> <p>Khan is not \"dim\", as the elite who he detests contemptuously say, but is not an intellectual either. He is a politician riding a wave of public disaffection, and that wave might just carry him to power. What he does afterwards is not something he worries about. He will be 60 this autumn. This would only bother him, he says, if he \"had nothing to look forward to\". But he is convinced that he does. From his hilltop Khan looks down and says: \"This country will go through its biggest change ever. A revolution is coming.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2013.

      "bodyText": "For a prime minister who is generally well-liked by colleagues and is thought by most of them to be making a decent fist of the job, David Cameron has, of late, developed an intriguing habit of losing key members of staff. Cameron is just over a year and a half into his time in No 10. Most advisers would give their right arm to spend a full five-year parliamentary term working at the beating heart of a new government and rubbing shoulders with a young and popular PM. Yet on Friday, Cameron's closest adviser and friend of 20 years, Steve Hilton, announced he was off. He became the fourth senior figure in less than a year to leave Downing Street. The intellectually restless, unconventional Hilton found the drudgery of dealing with civil servants stifling and tedious. He started his professional life in advertising and then ran John Major's successful 1992 election campaign at the age of 22. Hilton likes excitement and action, floating big ideas, developing big themes, being radical and achieving results. He developed the Tory \"detoxification\" strategy in opposition, telling Cameron to \"go green\" and to stand up for the NHS because \"nasty\" old-style Tories had a reputation for failing to do so. The \"big society\" was in large part his idea. But while developing these themes outside government was a dynamic and stimulating process, trying to implement them once in power proved to be anything but. With the big society very much on the backburner after failing to take off, and the Tories in danger of being retoxified over health, Hilton is taking a year of unpaid leave, moving to California to be with his wife and children. He says he will return to Cameron's side before the next election. But friends are less sure. If he comes back they think he will run for public office himself, perhaps as mayor of Brighton. Others who have left Cameron's side \u2013 in addition to former director of communications Andy Coulson, who quit amid the furore over phone hacking, are former head of policy James O'Shaughnessy, who departed last October and eventually joined the lobbying firm Portland, and Tim Chatwin, the former head of strategic communications, who joined Google. Another young high flyer, Rohan Silva, has been rumoured to be on his way too, though he denied that on Saturday. While Coulson was clearly an exception, well-placed Tories say there is a pattern here. They detect a level of frustration inside No 10 that helps explain the turnover of staff. \"If this government was the happiest and most exciting in history, this would not be happening,\" said Tim Montgomerie, editor of the ConservativeHome website. Montgomerie believes the departures result from disappointment at the \"compromises of coalition\" \u2013 the way Tories have had to choke back on their instincts for radicalism in order to keep Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats happy and on board. \"People in No 10 have found they are not able to do what they spent years of their life in opposition preparing for,\" he said. Many Tories now worry that with the loss of Hilton and Coulson, Cameron, who admits to having no strong ideology, lacks Thatcherite firepower around him. There is a worry that there will be no radical voice in his ear (as Hilton was), and no Coulson figure who can deliver a robust message in straight \"tabloid-speak\" to the kind of voters the party needs if it is to avoid having to govern with the Lib Dems for a second term. The former Tory MP Paul Goodman says Downing Street, even with Hilton there, lacked a certain dynamism. \"No 10,\" he said, \"reminds me rather of a large country house in which everybody gets on fine and life goes along very nicely but nobody really knows who is in charge of what.\" On Saturday, in a speech to the Conservative party spring conference in London, Cameron went out of his way to reassure the faithful that, post-Hilton, he would not lack radicalism, nor cave in too much to the Lib Dems. The Tories were making themselves unpopular not because they were unpleasant and did not care, he said, but because they were bold reformers who were prepared to take unpopularity on the chin for the sake of a better, fairer Britain. \"When any party comes to government, there is always a temptation to take a cautious path. When decisions are tough, the temptation gets greater. And when you're in coalition the temptation is greater still,\" Cameron told delegates. In education, on health reform and on cutting the deficit, he insisted he would not take the easy route. \"We won't get there by playing safe,\" he said. \"To be strong and fair we've got to be tough and bold.\" Despite such reassurance Tory MPs, particularly those with small majorities, are concerned. Many believe their prime minister lacks definition after 18 months governing with Nick Clegg, and dread the prospect of a second term of coalition. \"When you have counted out health reform which is a disaster, and education where things are going well, what else is there?\" asked one backbench MP. \"I have no idea, for instance, what we are going to put in the Queen's speech [in May].\" There is irritation in some circles that Cameron installed several civil servants in a new Downing Street policy unit, rather than using Conservatives with a thirst to drive forward distinctive Tory policies. With Hilton out of the way, the likes of Cameron's chief of staff, Edward Llewellyn, a centre-ground Tory who is a close friend of Paddy Ashdown and has a preoccupation for keeping the Lib Dems happy, is sure to have greater influence. Cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood, head of the home civil service, is another who may find himself called upon for more advice by Cameron. As will the chancellor, George Osborne, a shrewd political strategist but hardly a blue-sky thinker. Andrew Cooper, the director of political strategy who is a polling expert, and who some see as too governed by fear of public opinion, is another who may find himself trying to fill the Hilton void. Frustration at life within the coalition explains the sprouting up in recent months of numerous new groups of Tory MPs keen to make their mark and shape the future. There is the Free Enterprise Group, whose members include the hyperactive Elizabeth Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, which is pushing for lower taxes, less regulation and more liberal economic policy. The Fresh Start Group, whose leading lights include George Eustice and Chris Heaton-Harris, is urging the government to claw back more powers from Brussels, and the 301 Group \u2013 301 would be enough seats for an overall Tory majority \u2013 wants to reach out to the public and show that the Tories still care about issues such as the NHS. As one backbencher involved with the 301 Group put it: \"There is plenty of energy among the backbenchers. You could also call it frustration. The question is how do we transfer that energy and urgency to No 10.\"",

      "bodyText": "If there is a queue around the block leading into the local cinema this month, it might not be for the next in a chain of blockbuster action sequels. Should the cinema be a smaller, independent venture, people may be lining up to watch an opera or a ballet. The growth of live and recorded opera and ballet performance for cinema audiences is providing a bankable boost for many cinemas. This spring, there is an added attraction: more productions will be screened in 3D, bringing audiences even closer to the theatrical experiences at a fraction of the cost of tickets. Tomorrow, the Royal Opera House will release its new feature film, Madam Butterfly 3D, and the team behind the production argue it is not just a cheaper option for opera fans, but also a good way to be introduced to the form. \"This development in cinemas can only be a good thing,\" said cellist Julian Lloyd Webber this weekend. Although an evangelist for live music, he believes that the opportunity to see top-quality classical music, opera and ballet locally is opening up the art forms, with younger audiences drawn in by the lower prices. \"It's very hard for people to see these things in person, and they sell out very quickly, too,\" he said. \"I think it is a particularly good thing for the regions, which can be even more cut off.\" Madam Butterfly will be the second collaboration between Covent Garden and RealD, following last year's Carmen in 3D, while Matthew Bourne will be bringing his hugely successful reworking of Swan Lake into cinemas in a new 3D format this month. The ballet, famous for replacing the orthodox female corps de ballet with a menacing male ensemble at the north London dance venue in 1995, was filmed in 3D at Sadlers Wells, with Richard Winsor as the lead swan and Nina Goldman as the Queen. The multi-camera technique is billed as creating an illusion of space around the dancers, bringing a dramatic realism. The move follows the decision Sir Simon Rattle took last year when he brought the Berlin Philharmonic, where he has been principal conductor since 2002, to 140 British cinemas, also in 3D. The technology aimed to give cinemagoers the sensation of not only sitting in the front rows but in among the orchestra, with close-ups of virtuoso players. Rattle was following in the footsteps of New York's Metropolitan Opera, which has reached 1,500 screens in 46 countries, tripling its audience, selling record numbers of tickets and finding a useful extra stream of income for orchestral musicians. The British conductor's initiative was picked up last year by Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, who brought a high-definition performance with the Vienna Philharmonic to cinemas across the UK and Europe in a screening last September of the closing gala concert from the Lucerne Festival. Audiences in the Odeon in Covent Garden, the Swan Cinema in Ireland and nine Showcase cinemas in England and Scotland watched the concert from the KKL Luzern concert hall at the same time as viewers in Germany, Austria and Norway. Madam Butterfly was captured with 3D cameras during live performances at the Royal Opera House and tells the tragic story of a Japanese geisha's love for an American naval officer that moved Giacomo Puccini to compose one of the most popular scores of all time. Liping Zhang will appear as Butterfly, Cio-Cio San, a role for which she is acclaimed worldwide, and James Valenti is the dashing Pinkerton. The production is a revival of Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier's production, and will also star a retired opera singer from Suffolk called Robin Leggate who plays Goro, one of the lead roles. A Royal Opera House stalwart, Leggate has performed with the company for 25 years and Madam Butterfly was his last show there before he retired. His final performance at Covent Garden will now be seen in 1,500 cinemas worldwide. New York's Met, the pioneering opera house which has been running a cinema season since 2006, will also continue broadcasting live shows in British cinemas this spring, including Verdi's Ernani and Massenet's Manon.",

      "bodyText": "I stood in a field this week, listening to the first sounds of spring. The birds sang ardently, mocking the winter. Lambs were bleating in the sunshine. The earth was stirring with a tissue of inaudible sounds, the whispers of leaves uncurling and vegetation growing. To observe the seasonal rhythm so closely is deeply comforting. It's also one of the pleasures of living in rural Britain. This winter has been mild, but the earliest hint of spring, and the resurrection of the land it promises, is a key moment in the year. It is a time when our hearts fill with hope, a time when our faith in the British countryside is renewed once again. I was surprised then to read about the launch, last Wednesday, of Over the Hill?, a national campaign to warn retirees against moving from the city to the country. Mavis Cheek, prolific author and countryside dweller, is the mouthpiece of this campaign against chasing Arcadia. She described rural life as \"tough, a little bit dangerous and not for wimps\". Apparently she'll be returning to live in the city before she becomes too \"feeble\". Too feeble for what? Riding a bull or pressing flowers? The campaign attempts to dispel myths about the countryside that few people who live there would recognise. The idyll containing the village green, hollyhocks and roses spilling out of a cottage garden, dancing around the maypole and a time-ripened landlord pulling pints of foaming ale ceased being a common reality long ago. It probably was all pastoral bliss once. In her seminal book about the British landscape, A Land, published in 1951, Jacquetta Hawkes wrote: \"Recalling in tranquillity the slow possession of Britain by its people, I cannot resist the conclusion that the relationship reached its greatest intimacy, its most sensitive pitch, about two hundred years ago.\" Since then the Industrial Revolution, the modern agricultural revolution and the automobile have eaten up much of Eden. Today, large tracts of the \"countryside\" are covered in factories, motorways, retail parks and light industrial sites. Still, I wouldn't live anywhere else. I moved to a small farmhouse in the Black Mountains, south Wales, eight years ago. It wasn't a seamless integration. The fact that I ride a bicycle every day aroused suspicion. In the countryside you only use a bike if, well, something is wrong. The local hill farmers watched me pedal in and out of Abergavenny every day, and wondered. Five months after moving in, I was in the pub high up on a hillside, not far from home, on a Friday night. An old boy I knew only by the name of his farm cupped my elbow and led me gently to a corner of the bar. He fixed me with a stern gaze and tapped the end of his nose with a crooked finger: \"I see you on the bike, boy,\" he said. \"How long you lost your licence for then?\" Before the move, I lived in London for a decade. There are many things I still miss about metropolitan life. If I ever had to follow Mavis Cheek back to the city, though, I'd miss the countryside more: significantly, there are things I couldn't now live without \u2013 carrying logs into the house; the sound of wind in the woods; the continuous, incremental change in the landscape; buying meat from a local smallholder; the ampleness of time; the antique peace; the sweet-drugging scent of high summer; walking the dogs down the track at night, listening to tawny owls; the moonlight's silver illuminating the stream beneath the house; the community. In the city, you choose your community. It may be through work, your football team, a book club, the allotment group, your kids' school or your peers. It's unlikely, however, to include your neighbours. You may weave in and out of three or four different communities in the course of a weekend, and still not know the name of a single person who lives on your street. In the countryside, your neighbours are your only community. I'm lucky. I live in a place with a strong sense of community. My local pub is an active part of that. There are celebrations on key days in the calendar; children and dogs are welcome; the landlord accepts home deliveries on our behalf when we're out, and the beer is well kept and cheap. We have two village halls. Between them, there are activities or meetings every night of the week \u2013 singing workshops, the garden club, line dancing, keep-fit classes and the WI \u2013 as well as monthly films (\"flicks in the sticks\"), occasional quiz nights and the odd touring play. Every two years, Cwmyoy Hall stages a pantomime. It's always a sellout. You can be a cultural snob and cock a snook at all this \u2013 and urban people often do \u2013 but the point is that no one need feel excluded. To misquote Adlai Stevenson, \"people get the type of community they deserve\" \u2013 it's why I'm on the community council. The Over the Hill? campaign warns against old people becoming isolated in the countryside: you'd have to consciously choose to be, round here. My friend Jim Keates runs Cwmyoy Hall as a volunteer. He moved to the country 12 years ago, aged 61, \"knowing virtually no one,\" he said. \"Now I know everyone. It's a much more social place. People are far more prepared to share their lives, with honesty.\" This winter, I've spent a lot of time on my own in a wood near home, filming the video diary for a BBC4 series about British woodlands. When my father died recently, these sessions working alone in the wood were an anchor of my stability. The emotional buoyancy of a few solitary hours is something most people in the countryside would see as the norm. In the city, it's a luxury. The wood is on a steep bank of old red sandstone above the River Honddu at the entrance to the Vale of Ewyas. It is likely that trees \u2013 mainly ash, oak, alder, hazel, birch and hawthorn \u2013 have stood continuously here for some 8,000 years, managed throughout by man. It struck me recently that my experience working this wood, albeit with different tools, is similar to that of the Neolithic man who first sharpened a heavy flint axe and tentatively set about felling a tree 5,000 years or 200 generations ago. I find this connection to the human matrix profoundly moving: it's something city life cannot provide. Standing beneath the dome of St Paul's Cathedral or in front of Turner's The Fighting Temeraire in the National Gallery might be great experiences, but they don't match standing still in an ancient wood. Of course, retirees are unlikely to be managing woods, but the point is that you have to put your hands to work to get an inkling of the \"intimacy\" with the countryside that Hawkes wrote of. It is still there. To extract meaning and significance from the countryside, you have to dig the earth, grow vegetables and flowers, plant trees, pick sloes and blackberries, fashion a walking stick, cut the grass and make jam. There's a task for every age. \"First the tool, then the book,\" the writer and ecologist John Stewart Collis wrote. Perhaps Mavis Cheek is heading back to the city because she got this the wrong way round.

It is still there.</p> <p>To extract meaning and significance from the countryside, you have to dig the earth, grow vegetables and flowers, plant trees, pick sloes and blackberries, fashion a walking stick, cut the grass and make jam. There's a task for every age. \"First the tool, then the book,\" the writer and ecologist John Stewart Collis wrote. Perhaps Mavis Cheek is heading back to the city because she got this the wrong way round.</p> <p><em>Rob Penn is the author of </em>It's All About the Bike: the Pursuit of Happiness on Two Wheels<em>, published by Penguin</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Lansley has had to stall a major policy announcement on the future of social care for the elderly because Downing Street fears that it could turn into a political disaster on the scale of the health and social care bill. The Observer has been told that No 10 has \"seized the reins\" on social care from Lansley, the health secretary, and called in experts to ask their views on what should be in a much-delayed white paper. \"No 10 know they have to ensure this is not another disaster like the health bill,\" said one. One of the concerns is that plans to give more elderly people their own \"personal budgets\" \u2013 sums of money with which they can buy in social care from private providers \u2013 might open up the government to more damaging accusations of the \"marketisation\" of health services. The news comes as more than 1,000 older and disabled people from across the country prepare to travel to London on Tuesday to call on their MPs to end the crisis in social care. The lobby of parliament has been organised by the 60 organisations that make up the Care &amp; Support Alliance, including Age UK, Mencap, Scope, the MS Society, Macmillan Cancer Support, Sense, Rethink and Carers UK. The alliance argues that chronic underfunding of social care, combined with rapidly growing demand for care and cuts to local government budgets, has left the system in crisis. The white paper on the future of social care was originally expected early this year. MPs were then advised that it would be published in March. Now sources at the Department of Health say it will not be produced until \"late spring\". The delay caps a miserable two months for Lansley, during which time much of the medical profession has lined up to demand that his health and social care bill \u2013 which would devolve power to commission services to GPs and open the way for a greater role for the private sector \u2013 be scrapped. Downing Street is dismayed at the political damage inflicted on the coalition by the row and, in large part, blames Lansley for failing to explain the bill's purpose to the public and medical profession. Officials close to David Cameron also accept that No 10 paid insufficient attention to the plans before they were launched in a white paper in 2010. Now, sources say, they are determined to avoid a repeat of the fiasco when a white paper is published, and legislation then framed, on social care. Last month, the all-party select committee on health, chaired by Stephen Dorrell, the former Tory health secretary, dealt Lansley serious blows when it produced two reports that suggested his NHS reform programme failed to address adequately the most pressing health problem \u2013 that of how to deliver affordable and effective social care for the growing elderly population. The committee suggested that there needed to be far closer integration of the health and social care systems than was currently envisaged, so that more elderly people are treated and cared for at home and are not left until they require expensive and long stays in hospital. Such views have been registered in Downing Street. Lansley's plan to give every eligible person a \"personal budget\" through a direct payment by April 2013 has also raised concerns. Under the plan, first introduced by Labour, people's needs are assessed by local social services. They are then allocated a budget, paid as a direct cash payment, with which they can buy care. Currently, personal budgets cover 340,000 people. Opponents of the system argue that personal budgets will be inappropriate for huge numbers of elderly people who will not be able, or want, to manage their own funds, particularly at times when they are in greatest need of care. Critics also say people's needs will change and the system may not allow them to switch providers quickly enough if contracts have been signed. With the government also having to address the issue of how to fund social care, MPs believe the social care white paper could even be delayed until after the summer, when Lansley is expected to be replaced as health secretary. Problems over the health and social care bill now passing through parliament will mount next weekend when Liberal Democrats debate an emergency motion calling for it to be scrapped.",

      "bodyText": "LIQUID METAL BATTERIES MAY SAVE THE WORLD DONALD SADOWAY Bill Gates is putting massive investment into a technology that Donald Sadoway, professor of materials chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is developing. If we could store large amounts of electricity in times of abundance, we'd have it in times of scarcity. But at the moment, demand and supply on the power grid must balance. As Sadoway pointed out to the audience at TED 2012 in Long Beach, California, last week: \"The electricity powering the lights in this theatre was generated just moments ago.\" So how might we approach the idea of \"grid-level storage\" \u2013 batteries so large as to be able to supply hundreds of homes \u2013 without incurring astronomic expense? Sadoway's big idea \u2013 a hugely ambitious one, pursued, he says, \"not because it is easy but because it is hard\" \u2013 is to use the aluminium smelting process to create massive batteries made from liquid metal. \"If you want to make something dirt-cheap, make it out of dirt. Preferably dirt that's locally sourced,\" he says. Small prototypes are already working: a model to power 200 homes is on the drawing board. BE HUMBLE\u2026 AND CARRY A LIST ATUL GAWANDE In medicine, it's not possible for an individual to know everything, says Atul Gawande, a surgeon in Boston and New Yorker writer. It's become too specialised. The result? Mistakes. But Gawande looked to other industries, such as aviation, and came up with his \"checklist\" \u2013 a 19-point plan that included introducing surgical teams by name to each other at the start of the day. Introduced in eight hospitals, results were astonishing: post-surgical complications dropped 30%, the death rate by 47%. \"These tools force us to admit humility,\" he says. \"To value teamwork. To acknowledge that we can't know everything.\" PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY SHERRY TURKLE We need to converse, not just connect. Sherry Turkle is one of the most influential theorists about the online world, whose 1996 book, Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet, put her on the cover of Wired magazine. But the devices in our pockets have the effect of removing us from our own lives, she believes, and are changing who we are. \"Technology gives us the illusion of companionship without the means of friendship,\" she says. The solution? Now we need to relearn how to be alone. TEACH ROBOTS HOW TO THINK VIJAY KUMAR More precisely, rather than teaching them how to think, Vijay Kumar, professor of engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, showed how to get \"nano quadrotors\" \u2013 palm-sized, four-rotor helicopters \u2013 to navigate by themselves. The devices are \"autonomous agile aerial robots\" that can navigate around objects without any human intervention, autonomously co-ordinate their positions across the group and gather into what looks like a swarm of alien invaders. The applications are mind-boggling and ever so slightly scary. BE VULNERABLE, NOT WEAK BRENE BROWN When Bren\u00e9 Brown gave a lecture on vulnerability at a small TEDx event in Houston in 2010, the video of her personal and poignant talk went viral. Initially, at least, that made the research professor at the University of Houston's college of social work feel more vulnerable. But more than three million people have now watched it. And Brown, who is also the author of The Gifts of Imperfection, wants to spread the message that vulnerability is a sign of courage, not weakness \u2013 and that empathy is the antidote to shame. TEACH NEUROSCIENCE TO KIDS GREG GAGE As a frustrated neuroscientist in a postgraduate programme at the University of Michigan, Greg Gage decided to get out of academia and find a more grassroots approach to his subject. The result is his organisation Backyard Brains, dedicated to making neuroscience experiments possible at greatly reduced cost, both at home and in schools. His simple \"spiker boxes\" allow the user to hear and see neurons firing in insects. Send an electrical signal from music on an iPhone into a cockroach's leg \u2013 and watch it dance. BEAR WITNESS BRYAN STEVENSON The greatest inequality in society arises because of lack of \"proximity\", says Bryan Stevenson. And until we pay attention to other people's suffering, we cannot be fully human. Stevenson, law professor at New York University and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative in Alabama. He gave a gripping talk at TED 2012 last week on the US justice system \u2013 the only one in the world where 13-year-olds are sent to die in jail. . And one in nine inmates on death row turn out to be innocent. The opposite of poverty in the US is not wealth, he told the audience, who had paid $7,500 each for a ticket \u2013 \"it's justice\". A day later, attendees had raised $1.3m for his campaign to prevent children being sent to adult jails. \"You judge a society's character not by how it treats its rich,\" he said. \"But how it treats its poor.\" BE NICE TO NERDS REGINA DUGAN Nerds are the scientists and engineers who build things that make life better, believes Regina Dugan, the head of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) \u2013 the US department of defence's agency for \"creating and preventing strategic surprise\". And she demonstrated a hummingbird aircraft that weighs less than an AA battery and can fly in all directions. To learn how to succeed, though, she said, you have to be ready for failure \u2013 because \"there's no way to learn to fly at Mach 20\" if you're not prepared to leave the ground in the first place. CITIES MAKE US SMARTER ED GLAESER Cities are what happens when there's \"an absence of physical space between people\", says Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard University and the author of The Triumph of the City. Gandhi said that the future lay in villages, but \"with great respect\", Glaeser says, Gandhi was wrong. Cities are where humans create and collaborate with other other humans to remarkable effect \u2013 as he points out, the three largest metropolitan areas in the US account for 80% of gross domestic product but only contain 13% of the population. DABBLE IN NUCLEAR FUSION TAYLOR WILSON At 10, Wilson built his first bomb out of a pill bottle and some cleaning products that he found lying around the house. At 11, he started mining for uranium, taking his dad on long road trips to the fertile soil of Arizona. And at 14, having been enrolled in a gifted students' programme and offered safe facilities at the University of Nevada in Reno, he became the youngest person in the world \u2013 and one of only a few dozen of any age \u2013 to create a working nuclear fusion reactor. Now 17, he says nuclear fusion is the fuel of the future. And children may just change the world.",

      "bodyText": "Video footage has been released showing graves in a British military cemetery in Libya being destroyed by what appears to be an Islamist militia. The video, shot by the militia themselves, shows more than 30 armed men kicking down the gravestones of British servicemen while comrades use sledgehammers to break the cenotaph. \"Break the cross of the dogs!\" one man can be heard shouting as another soldier perches on a ladder to smash the cenotaph cross with a mallet. The cemetery, near the eastern city of Benghazi, hold the remains of more than 100 British and Commonwealth servicemen who fought for Montgomery's Eighth Army in the second world war. Its desecration has caused shockwaves in both Libya and in Britain, with MP Daniel Kawczynski, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group for Libya, labelling the militia \"desecrators\". In Libya, the ruling National Transitional Council last week issued an apology on its website, with one official blaming the destruction on \"three young men\". But the video, which was recorded by the militia itself, shows the attack to be more organised; the unit arrives equipped with sledgehammers and a ladder. None of the perpetrators has been arrested and the cemetery, one of dozens across Libya built by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission after the second world war, is today in ruins. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission said no staff had been hurt, but had reports that a second cemetery, also near Benghazi, had been vandalised. \"We are awaiting a detailed report, but in both cemeteries headstones were broken and disfigured,\" it said in a statement. The Foreign Office said 200 tombs were damaged at one cemetery, the Cross of Remembrance, and a quarter of graves at the Benghazi military cemetery. Libya's government described the damage as \"irresponsible and criminal\" and said it would punish those responsible. In the video few of the militia make any attempt to disguise their identities, apparently unconcerned about being held to account, including the cameraman, a young man in a black-and-white scarf who films himself attacking a white marble gravestone [see footnote]. The reasons for the attack remain unclear, but are possibly connected to anti-American protests following the burning of the Qur'an in Afghanistan last month. One militiaman can be heard saying he wants to make war on the \"crusaders\". Another militiaman complains that he cannot kick down one grave because \"this soldier must have been good to his parents\" and the cameraman replies: \"Come on, they are all dogs, who cares.\" A gravestone bearing the Star of David of a Jewish serviceman is singled out. No militia has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but Libyan sources say the dress and comments of those filmed indicate that they are a jihadist brigade. \"We don't support this action,\" said Farouk Ben Ahmeda, a militiaman in Misrata. \"This is a sin. These guys are messing up the revolution.\" One of the most prominent of the clutch of Islamist militias in Libya, the Omar Mukghtar Brigade, condemned the attack. \"Whoever did this attack was wrong,\" said brigade spokesman Abdul Jawad Albaree. \"Whoever did it wants to destroy whatever relations Libya has with Britain.\" Kawczynski called on the UK authorities to make sure that the perpetrators were prosecuted. \"The British government must take an active interest in the case,\" he said. \"We need to highlight to the NTC that, if they do not undertake effective procedures against those who committed this action, confidence in the rule of law will suffer.\" The brazenness of the attack highlights the impunity with which some militias operate in post-Gaddafi Libya. In Tripoli, a rogue militia continues to hold two British journalists, reporter Nicholas Davies-Jones, 36, and cameraman Gareth Montgomery-Johnson, 37. The pair were snatched by the militia 10 days ago while filming late at night in the capital, and their captors say they are being investigated because they were in Libya without visas working for the Iranian-operated Press TV. Montgomery-Johnson's sister, Melanie Gribble, told the Observer she was desperate to get in touch with the pair. \"I'm worried. I get different advice. Some say hold off, others say push it.\" Amnesty International's Donatella Rovera says the two cases highlight the lack of control Libya's central government exercises over armed groups. \"The NTC's lack of action is an indication of their own inability or unwillingness to confront the militias,\" she said. The cemetery attack underlines the different outlook that separates Libya's Islamist militias from secular groups. While mainstream units regard Britain as an ally, thanks to the role that Nato played in last year's revolution, Islamist groups view Britain and the west as a threat. Libya's Muslim Brotherhood, which last week launched its own political party to contest June's elections, has distanced itself from the attacks. Zarroug Koukle, from the Brotherhood, said those responsible should be educated rather than punished. \u2022 The following correction was published on 18 March 2012: Our piece on the desecration of British war graves in Libya said the gravestones were made of white marble, but Commonwealth war graves are all made from white Portland stone (\"British war graves in Libya desecrated by Islamist militants, News).",

New EU rules banning the housing of hens in conventional cages are being blamed for what some in the industry are already labelling a \"crisis\", as competition among food manufacturers to source eggs sends prices rocketing. The price of eggs on the EU wholesale market has nearly quadrupled over the past week to more than four euros a kilo. \"It's now no longer a question of price, it's a question of supply,\" said one industry source who asked to be anonymous. \"I estimate that within three to four weeks some companies will be at breaking point.\" Eggs \u2013 both in liquid and powdered form \u2013 are used in a variety of food products from biscuits and cakes to pasta and mayonnaise. A shortage of their main ingredient would threaten the viability of some food manufacturers, several of which are already closing down their production lines because they cannot afford the soaring price of eggs and cannot raise their prices because supermarkets refuse to pass on any increase to consumers. \"We can see businesses going bust very quickly unless something is done about this soon,\" one food distributor said. \"We've never seen anything like this. Commodity prices for things such as wheat and sugar go up and down, but this is different.\" One food manufacturer recently approached 10 egg suppliers and was told by eight that they could not supply. The Farmers Guardian reports that a traditional ice cream manufacturer in Kent was informed last Monday that the price he pays for egg yolk will rise by 70% from the start of this month. In January new rules came into force stipulating that egg producers in EU member states must keep their hens in specially enriched pens. The move has been broadly welcomed by animal rights campaigners, but many egg producers have felt unable to absorb the costs of buying the pens.

As a result, the country has gone from being a net exporter to a net importer of eggs, an event that has helped push prices up. Under the new rules, manufacturers are not now permitted to source their eggs from non-compliant EU countries, 13 of which have yet to introduce the new pens. British food manufacturers are struggling to source eggs legitimately from abroad.

      "bodyText": "If Rupert Murdoch didn't know his power was in ineluctable decline, he had only to watch Harriet Harman on TV last week. When Harriet scents the wind and concludes she has nothing to lose from attacking him, the game is well and truly up. Murdoch appeared in London last month wearing a Cosa Nostra-style trilby and, with some of his old moxy, launched a sell-out Sunday title. Yet within 24 hours, Sue Akers, a deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police told the Leveson inquiry that the Sun had spawned a culture of corrupt payments to a network of public officials. These were, she said, \"regular, frequent and sometimes involved significant sums of money\", adding that the payments were authorised at a very senior level and that the journalists were well aware that they were breaking the law. This could not be more serious for News Corp, which stands to lose so much if the bribing of foreign officials outside the United States is held to place the American parent company in breach of the US's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. But Akers's statement was merely the start of the rolling disaster of Murdoch's supposed bounce-back week. News International could be forgiven for thinking that what followed was entirely choreographed by his enemies. This is probably no more than the multiple reactions that occur once a cover-up is exposed. This scandal has now got an unpredictable, violent energy all of its own and that is going to be very hard to manage for a man who is 81 next week. Just as Sue Akers completed her evidence, the singer Charlotte Church began to read out a statement that told how her parents were harassed, put under surveillance and her mother bullied into revealing her medical condition. \"Someone in a newspaper thought that was OK,\" she said. \"How can that be, in any right-thinking society?\" That question hovers in many forms over the proceedings of Leveson. How did we allow so much intimidation to occur? How come the police denied to Lord Prescott that he and his colleagues' phone messages were intercepted when he was deputy prime minister? What about the implications for national security? How were News International's executives and journalists allowed to cosy up to the senior police officers in charge of the phone-hacking investigation? And what were journalists from the News of the World up to when they started monitoring the movements and calls of a police officer investigating the murder of private detective Daniel Morgan? There are allegations of lies, deceit, cash payments, bribes, eavesdropping, multiple breaches of trust and the perversion of justice and due process, corruption and downright malfeasance on such a scale that we should be asking how our society tolerated all that flows from Rupert Murdoch's power. The Daniel Morgan case is the most obscure part of the whole affair, not easily summarised in a few paragraphs. The murder of the private detective who was trying to sell details of police corruption 25 years ago has been investigated five times. It is now believed that News of the World reporters intimidated the investigating officer, Detective Superintendent Dave Cook and his then wife, TV presenter Jacqui Hames. Appearing at Leveson, she said: \"I believe that the real reason for the News of the World placing us under surveillance was that suspects in the Daniel Morgan murder inquiry were using their association with a powerful and well-resourced newspaper to try to intimidate us and so attempt to subvert the investigation.\" That is a very serious allegation indeed. The next day, the Labour MP Tom Watson used parliamentary privilege to name police officers in the Morgan case and then offer a free-flowing analysis of the corruption between News International and the police. While he was speaking, Twitter hummed with the revelation that Rebekah Brooks, editor when Cook and Hames were targetted, had been loaned a former police horse by her friends at the Met. As the media absorbed the news about the horse (which the prime minister says he probably rode), Watson's speech and an announcement by the police minister, Nick Herbert, that the Met was carrying out a forensic review of the case, the big news broke. James Murdoch had resigned the executive chairmanship of News International. Given that James was probably pushed because of his failure to manage the crisis and tell the truth convincingly, it's possible that he may soon lose the chairmanship of BSkyB as well. About a fifth of shareholders no longer want him there and many more must now wonder if he and News International can be regarded as fit and proper persons to run a broadcaster in the UK. Crispin Odey, once married to James's half sister, Prudence, predicted that he would be ousted as chairman. Rupert Murdoch's court is in disarray. Just as the old dynast thought he had set things up prettily for his children James and Elisabeth, the whole project fell apart. The scandal seems unlikely to be contained in Britain. The FBI is nosing around News Corp executives who worked for Sky Italia and American shareholders must be beginning to wonder if the failings and actions of a minority shareholding could jeopardize the health of the entire company. To his stockholders, Murdoch may appear undaunted but there is now no obvious heir among his children and his obsession with newspapers and the power they once gave him could come to be seen as an eccentric and damaging obsession. Thirty News International employees have now been arrested on suspicion of phone-hacking, computer-hacking or bribery, and last Thursday news broke that they had been joined by the Sun's defence editor, Virginia Wheeler. More arrests among public officials are promised and each one will be a danger to Murdoch in America. The most fascinating experience of last week was watching Robert Jay QC for the Leveson inquiry questioning two former assistant commissioners at the Met, John Yates and Andy Hayman. It was a masterclass in forensic examination and although the inquiry doesn't seek to pronounce guilt, the conclusion that these two powerful men buried the evidence of widespread wrongdoing that lay in Glenn Mulcaire's notebooks, because of their relations with Murdoch's people, was unmistakable. The process is polite but remorseless, and sitting in court it occurred to me that there could not be a more civilised antidote to Murdoch's influence in the UK. He will never recover from this exposure.",

When Harriet scents the wind and concludes she has nothing to lose from attacking him, the game is well and truly up.</p> <p>Murdoch appeared in London last month wearing a Cosa Nostra-style trilby and, with some of his old moxy, launched a sell-out Sunday title. Yet within 24 hours, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/27/sun-culture-illegal-payments-leveson?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Sue Akers</a>, a deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police told the Leveson inquiry that the <em>Sun</em> had spawned a culture of corrupt payments to a network of public officials. These were, she said, \"regular, frequent and sometimes involved significant sums of money\", adding that the payments were authorised at a very senior level and that the journalists were well aware that they were breaking the law.</p> <p>This could not be more serious for News Corp, which stands to lose so much if the bribing of foreign officials outside the United States is held to place the American parent company in breach of the US's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. But Akers's statement was merely the start of the rolling disaster of Murdoch's supposed bounce-back week. News International could be forgiven for thinking that what followed was entirely choreographed by his enemies.</p> <p>This is probably no more than the multiple reactions that occur once a cover-up is exposed. This scandal has now got an unpredictable, violent energy all of its own and that is going to be very hard to manage for a man who is 81 next week.</p> <p>Just as Sue Akers completed her evidence, the singer<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/27/charlotte-church-phone-hacking-settled?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"> Charlotte Church</a> began to read out a statement that told how her parents were harassed, put under surveillance and her mother bullied into revealing her medical condition. \"Someone in a newspaper thought that was OK,\" she said. \"How can that be, in any right-thinking society?\"</p> <p>That question hovers in many forms over the proceedings of Leveson. How did we allow so much intimidation to occur? How come the police denied to Lord Prescott that he and his colleagues' phone messages were intercepted when he was deputy prime minister? What about the implications for national security? How were News International's executives and journalists allowed to cosy up to the senior police officers in charge of the phone-hacking investigation? And what were journalists from the <em>News of the World</em> up to when they started monitoring the movements and calls of a police officer investigating the murder of private detective <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/11/daniel-morgan-axe-murder-case-timeline\" title=\"\">Daniel Morgan?</a> There are allegations of lies, deceit, cash payments, bribes, eavesdropping, multiple breaches of trust and the perversion of justice and due process, corruption and downright malfeasance on such a scale that we should be asking how our society tolerated all that flows from Rupert Murdoch's power.</p> <p>The Daniel Morgan case is the most obscure part of the whole affair, not easily summarised in a few paragraphs. The murder of the private detective who was trying to sell details of police corruption 25 years ago has been investigated five times. It is now believed that <em>News of the World</em> reporters intimidated the investigating officer, Detective Superintendent Dave Cook and his then wife, TV presenter Jacqui Hames. Appearing at Leveson, she said: \"I believe that the real reason for the <em>News of the World</em> placing us under surveillance was that suspects in the Daniel Morgan murder inquiry were using their association with a powerful and well-resourced newspaper to try to intimidate us and so attempt to subvert the investigation.\" That is a very serious allegation indeed.</p> <p>The next day, the Labour MP Tom Watson used parliamentary privilege to name police officers in the Morgan case and then offer a free-flowing analysis of the corruption between News International and the police.

      "bodyText": "A single question has plagued me all week. I am on a book tour in the US, talking about Russia and the Putin regime, and at some point I am invariably asked: \"But should we really take the middle-class revolution seriously? After all, Vladimir Putin has a broad base of support, on which he can rely after he wins [today's] presidential election.\" Having answered this question no fewer than 20 times, I am still stumped momentarily whenever I am asked it because it's hard to formulate the right answer when the question is so profoundly wrong. Sometimes, we journalists come up with an image so seductive, so complete and easy to use that we keep running with it regardless of how well or poorly it reflects reality. Russia's \"middle-class revolution\", also known as the \"Jean-Jacques revolution\", named after a Moscow chain of bistros, is one such image. These phrases paint a picture of an entire generation of successful urban young people who, having started their careers and their families in the last decade, have now turned their attention to their country and are planning to put it in order. It is a perfect media image, because it seems to contain the answers to the big questions. Why have the protests only started now? Because before, today's 30-year-old revolutionaries were too busy setting up their lives. Why are many of the posters and the protests themselves so fun and whimsical? Because they are organised by the Russian creative class. And it goes without saying that Putin's \"broad base of support\" \u2013 the civil servants, the not so rich and the not so young, or, conversely, those who are too young to be part of the \"middle-class revolution\" \u2013 remains unchanged. The only problem with the \"middle-class revolution\" image is that it is dead wrong. During the second large-scale protest in Moscow last December, the organisers decided they wanted to spend some of the money they had been able to raise on commissioning a professional poll of the rally. They wanted to know who made up the movement, or at least its Moscow part. Here is some of what they found out. The protesters belonged to all age groups; 25% were between 18 and 24; 22% were over 55, with the age groups in between distributed pretty evenly. They came from all walks of life: a majority were white-collar workers, but only a small minority were managers; 8% were blue-collar workers, 2% were housewives and 12% were full-time students. Nor did they appear particularly affluent: only 5% said they could afford to buy anything they needed or wanted; 28% said they could afford a car but still had to restrict their spending; 40% agreed with the statement: \"We can buy some expensive things, such as a television set or a refrigerator, but we cannot afford a car\"; 21% said they had enough money to feed and clothe themselves but nothing beyond that; 7% said they did not even make enough to afford the bare necessities. They also told the pollsters why they had joined the protest. Three-quarters said they were fed up with the way things worked in the country, and fewer than 15% said they actually liked the organisers of the protest or the political parties they represented. When the poll's results were released, both the Russian and the western media went with headlines heralding the coming of the \"middle-class revolution\". Which proves that facts have trouble getting in the way of a good story. The problem with a catchphrase that becomes bigger than the story itself, however, is that it ultimately kills the real story. If the Russian protest movement is supposed to consist of young urban professionals, then how do you tell the story of the scores of older people who came out in the bitter cold on 29January, when Moscow held its first car protest? The young professionals (and the non-professionals and the not so young) drove their cars, adorned with white ribbons that are the symbols of the protest movement, around Moscow's Garden Ring Road. From the sidewalks, they were greeted by clumps of pedestrians, many of them quite elderly, who were waving their own white ribbons. How do you tell the story of the city of Kovrov, backwater of backwaters, population 145,000, where 120 people came out to protest? There are no bistros in Kovrov and no young urban professionals. Or how do you tell one of my favourite stories of the protest movement, the story of the high-school students? They showed up for the first organising meeting I called in December; I simply suggested anyone who wanted to participate in direct-action organising should come to a Moscow cafe to look for allies. A pudgy girl named Anya came up on stage and said she wanted to organise flash mobs. A few days later, Moscow underground riders witnessed a flawlessly organised action: people wearing tape over their mouths, with the words \"MY VOICE WAS STOLEN\", were getting on different trains at different stations, all to converge at a predetermined moment at one of the central metro stations. Several more actions followed, culminating in a series of one-person pickets (one of the few protest activities for which no permit is necessary) a couple of weeks ago. In spite of what the law says, the score or so of picketers were picked up by police. At least three of them turned out to be under age. And once Anya got out of jail later that day, she was grounded by her parents. Anya was released from house arrest after a few days, but I fear her parents will not allow her to do much protesting in the near future. I am glad at least to be telling a bit of her story. And I hope someone gives a proper account of the old people protesting in the streets of Moscow and of whoever is protesting in the streets of Kovrov. Because as long as these and other stories are not told and as long as the Russian and western media insist on writing on the \"middle-class revolution\", they are missing the biggest story of all. It may not sound quite as colourful, but it is a lot more important. It's called a mass movement. And that, irrespective of the inevitable result of the election, is exactly what is about to change the course of Russian history.

      "bodyText": "Soaring household bills, childcare costs, long working hours \u2026 modern families are under such extraordinary pressure that many are turning to a new superhero for help: the flying granny. Research by the Daycare Trust points to a trend in working parents who, struggling to afford childcare, are finding it cheaper and easier to fly in their mothers from abroad or from the other end of the country to look after grandchildren. The phenomenon came to light during the Daycare Trust's research into the UK's growing reliance on informal childcare. The charity's research manager, Jill Rutter, said the extent of the long-distance grandparenting had surprised her. \"It happens both ways \u2013 children being sent to grandparents abroad during school holidays, grandparents going abroad to help, or grandparents flying in to help with grandchildren in the UK.\" With some 5.4 million UK nationals living abroad, many of them retired, and 11% of the British population born abroad, the modern family is a far-flung affair, so the flying grannies are in demand. The research suggested that almost half of families relied on informal childcare \u2013 non-regulated arrangements with friends or family \u2013 and that half of that is provided by grandparents. \"Based on a survey of 1,413 parents across Britain, we found that in a typical week 7% used relatives who normally live outside the UK to provide childcare, and 5% used it as their main form of childcare,\" said Rutter . \"There was no statistically significant difference in the use of overseas-domiciled relatives to provide informal childcare between parents of white British ethnicity and those from minority ethnic groups. This suggests that white retirement migrants in places like Spain fly in to provide childcare, as well as grandparents who are visiting from places like Poland and Jamaica. \"I think this trend reflects two things. First, we are moving around much more and, second, parents still struggle to find affordable formal childcare.\" Jolanta Zdral is a case in point. The 41-year-old lives in Hull with her electrician husband and children, aged 13 and 10. Her mother and mother-in-law take it in turns to come from Poland to help. \"I'm an interpreter, so my hours are not set. I would try to book my child for after-school club only to find it was fully booked that day, so it's a struggle. We moved from London, where I had friends I could rely on, but I don't up here. \"I pay for the air tickets and they are happy to be my flying grannies. Usually it's Easter and the half-term; in the summer my children go over there. I don't know how I would manage without my mother. A lot of my Polish friends do the same thing. \"Childcare is so expensive and just so difficult to get it to work around you.\" The Daycare Trust says its findings serve as a warning to policymakers about the way people are being forced to juggle parenting. Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute, said: \"Families resorting to international travel to solve childcare problems shows just how much needs to change in terms of UK childcare provision. \"Grandparents have long propped up the UK economy with their informal childcare service. It is startling that even those grandparents living abroad can find themselves called on to help their struggling adult children maintain a precarious work-life balance.\"",

      "body": "<p>Soaring household bills, childcare costs, long working hours \u2026 modern families are under such extraordinary pressure that many are turning to a new superhero for help: the flying granny.</p> <p>Research by the <a href=\"http://www.daycaretrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Daycare Trust</a> points to a trend in working parents who, struggling to afford childcare, are finding it cheaper and easier to fly in their mothers from abroad or from the other end of the country to look after grandchildren.</p> <p>The phenomenon came to light during the Daycare Trust's research into the UK's growing reliance on informal childcare. The charity's research manager, Jill Rutter, said the extent of the long-distance grandparenting had surprised her. \"It happens both ways \u2013 children being sent to grandparents abroad during school holidays, grandparents going abroad to help, or grandparents flying in to help with grandchildren in the UK.\"</p> <p>With some 5.4 million UK nationals living abroad, many of them retired, and 11% of the British population born abroad, the modern family is a far-flung affair, so the flying grannies are in demand. The research suggested that almost half of families relied on informal childcare \u2013 non-regulated arrangements with friends or family \u2013 and that half of that is provided by grandparents.</p> <p>\"Based on a survey of 1,413 parents across Britain, we found that in a typical week 7% used relatives who normally live outside the UK to provide childcare, and 5% used it as their main form of childcare,\" said Rutter .</p> <p>\"There was no statistically significant difference in the use of overseas-domiciled relatives to provide informal childcare between parents of white British ethnicity and those from minority ethnic groups. This suggests that white retirement migrants in places like Spain fly in to provide childcare, as well as grandparents who are visiting from places like Poland and Jamaica.</p> <p>\"I think this trend reflects two things. First, we are moving around much more and, second, parents still struggle to find affordable formal childcare.\"</p> <p>Jolanta Zdral is a case in point. The 41-year-old lives in Hull with her electrician husband and children, aged 13 and 10. Her mother and mother-in-law take it in turns to come from Poland to help.</p> <p>\"I'm an interpreter, so my hours are not set. I would try to book my child for after-school club only to find it was fully booked that day, so it's a struggle. We moved from London, where I had friends I could rely on, but I don't up here.</p> <p>\"I pay for the air tickets and they are happy to be my flying grannies. Usually it's Easter and the half-term; in the summer my children go over there. I don't know how I would manage without my mother. A lot of my Polish friends do the same thing.</p> <p>\"Childcare is so expensive and just so difficult to get it to work around you.\"</p> <p>The Daycare Trust says its findings serve as a warning to policymakers about the way people are being forced to juggle parenting. Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute, said: \"Families resorting to international travel to solve childcare problems shows just how much needs to change in terms of UK childcare provision.</p> <p>\"Grandparents have long propped up the UK economy with their informal childcare service. It is startling that even those grandparents living abroad can find themselves called on to help their struggling adult children maintain a precarious work-life balance.\"</p>",

They're a pair of baby Amur leopards I picked up late last year for about 15 quid a month, courtesy of the World Wrestling Federation (no, me neither). The small chaps, like many in their declining species, have been having a hard time of it in recent years owing to poaching, forest degradation and climate change in the Russian far east. I would not normally be susceptible to a hard-luck story about furry beasties, but when you witness their plight in a velvety advert on Discovery, the go-to television channel for when you return from an evening sparkled with Jamaica's national embrocation, all sense of proportion flies out of the window. So does your recollection of key events any time after midnight. Presumably, that is why WWF chooses to purchase advertising space after the witching hour. Yet when it informed me a month later that I had sponsored the twins by phoning its 0800 number my surprise turned to joy when I discovered that they were called Henrik and Lubo. Since then, the federation has provided me with regular updates about the boys and they seem to be keeping fine. I also quite like the feeling of sanctimoniousness that comes with the knowledge that you've done your bit to help one of God's other works of creation. Animals and me go back a long way and I bow to no chiel when it comes to concern for the welfare of wild beasties everywhere. Yet I would normally much prefer to donate money to charities that alleviate human suffering. Indeed, I have gently mocked those among us who think that the road to salvation lies in the welfare of animals when children all over the world are being tortured and killed by gangsters such as Assad and his apologists in Beijing and the Kremlin. Britain's national obsession with animals has always left me cold. Indeed, the Scottish media are pursuing a scorched-earth policy in ensuring that every cough, spit and snort of as many species as possible is presented nightly for our edification. Every week, we are presented with a medical bulletin on the health and welfare of Sunshine and Sweetie, the two pandas we've spent \u00a37m renting from the same Chinese government that is assisting in the slaughter of the innocents in Syria. The pandas have only been here for a couple of months but already it looks like the Chinese have sold us, well, a couple of pups. Even by the indolent standards of these largely inert creatures it's clear that this pair are the cast-offs of a breeding programme in the Sichuan province. For Sunshine and Sweetie have thrown so many sickies since they got here that they'll soon be eligible for jobs with North Lanarkshire Council. Edinburgh Zoo is hoping that when the two bears eventually get round to pursuing a carnal relationship, it will all have proved to be worthwhile when a baby panda is produced that will, presumably, be called \"wee man\". Such, though, has been their lamentable performance so far that Rangers' tax liabilities will be paid in full before we hear the patter of tiny paws in Edinburgh. The penguins, though, are not happy. Apparently, Edinburgh Zoo is called the penguin zoo because it's got stacks of these creatures that, oddly, are named after the kenspeckle chocolate biscuit. Furthermore, in a fit of pique at the attention being lavished on their new neighbours, these revolting creatures have recently begun to defecate on the idiots who are queuing to see the pandas, having shelled out many hard-earned pounds for the privilege. BBC Scotland also told us last week that the penguins were being shipped off to Wales because their swimming pool has sprung a leak. Haud me back. We were even treated last week to the nocturnal exploits of a male rabbit that the Sun insisted was called \"Roger\". It seems that some cheeky prankster lobbed Roger into a compound full of lady rabbits one evening last week. The tabloid's wildlife team then published a picture of Roger; eyes shut, flat on his back and completely zonked after a conjugal night with the ladies. Perhaps a zookeeper could surreptitiously throw Roger in with Sunshine and Sweetie to remind them of their reproductive responsibilities. Am I missing something here? Has the SNP government, in a bid to meet its 2020 carbon-reduction targets, turned the entire country of Scotland into Yellowstone National Park? I even got a withering stare from a woman in Glasgow city centre last week who wanted me to donate to the RSPCA. I told her I'd already done my animal welfare bit by adopting Henrik and Lubo, but you could tell she thought I was lying. There is a new animal militancy abroad and soon I shall have to start carrying my adoption certificate for Henrik and Lubo in the same way you carry your driving licence to ward off the traffic cops. On two occasions in the last few weeks, I have visited restaurants and noticed that some diners had brought their dogs with them. \"It's the dog or me,\" I wanted to inform the ma\u00eetre d' of each establishment. But I knew in my heart that such an ultimatum would most probably result in my summary ejection. I like dogs and once knew a lovely lady who had two splendid ones hailing from an eastern European background. They were so sleek, good-looking and healthy that they would have got a lumber before closing time in some of Glasgow's more vivid establishments. Even so, the only place for animals in a restaurant is on a plate. Unless, in some evolutionary thrust, they have somehow acquired the knowledge of wiping their bums and brushing their teeth.",

      "bodyText": "Since he escaped from a brainwashing cult 34 years ago, Ian Haworth has survived character assassination, lawsuits, bankruptcy and death threats. But now the founder of the Cult Information Centre, which educates the public about the threats posed by pseudo-religious groups, finds himself under attack from an unexpected quarter. The Charity Commission is seeking to withdraw the centre's charitable status, a move that would in effect end its activities. \"If that happened, donations from trusts \u2013 which are our lifeline \u2013 would evaporate. We wouldn't be able to afford our office and we would no longer be able to operate,\" said Haworth, who established the centre as a response to his experiences in a Toronto-based cult and to the Jonestown massacre of 1978 that saw 918 people die in a mass suicide in Guyana, South America. Set up as an educational charity, the centre \u2013 whose three trustees are anonymous owing to fear of reprisals \u2013 had an income of just over \u00a340,000 last year. \"Most people don't understand cults, so money is hard to come by,\" Haworth said. \"We don't make any money. That's why there are not many people trying to get into this field. Now, if we don't know whether we are going to retain our charitable status, it makes life doubly hard.\" The problems started when a complaint was made to the commission about the centre's educational remit. Concerns were raised that the centre was failing to observe neutrality. A suggestion, made by the commission, for the centre to become a mental health charity was accepted, only for a further complaint to be made that has left its future in the balance. Haworth believes several cults have taken exception to the centre's website, which once carried links to other websites warning of the dangers of certain groups and which attracted visitors from around the world. The centre's closure would mark the end of 25 years' work, which has seen Haworth lecture in hundreds of schools, act as an expert witness in high-profile criminal trials, advise the police and raise awareness of cult-related issues in the media. The centre estimates that it receives some 4,000 inquiries a year. Haworth said the centre's work had attracted further interest after the 9/11 attacks, which prompted a focus on how religious leaders can radicalise followers into becoming terrorists. High-profile incidents involving cults \u2013 notably the sarin gas attack in Japan and the Waco siege in Texas \u2013 have also heightened awareness. Haworth was summoned to a meeting at the Charity Commission in the autumn of 2010, when he was informed that his organisation might lose its charitable status. \"I thought, 'How can that be?' They'd got one complaint. I was gobsmacked. Our lawyer was stunned. I felt like jumping in the Thames to cool off.\" The centre has found itself under attack before. When it applied for charitable status, a number of cult-like organisations, some of which enjoyed charitable status, complained to the commission. It is understood that this time the complaint has been made by an individual with close links to the Church of Scientology, the celebrity sect whose members include Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and John Travolta and which strenuously denies it is a cult. A Scientology spokesman denied that the complaint had been made by the church. Haworth was made bankrupt after he was pursued by a Canadian organisation in the mid-1990s. He has also been threatened verbally and via putative lawsuits from several cults. His organisation's address is kept secret for fear of being targeted by cult supporters. Haworth expressed concern that the UK was lagging behind other European countries in raising awareness. France has introduced a law to protect its citizens from cults and has a government-funded unit monitoring them. German children are educated about cults from an early age, while Spain has several organisations that track their development. A spokeswoman for the commission said its policy was not to discuss the identity of complainants and that it was in talks with the centre about its future. \"The charity informed us in June 2011 that it would appoint an independent adviser to the trustees to review the charity's activities and suggested a framework for future activities to ensure these are exclusively educational and charitable,\" the spokeswoman said. \"We await the results of this review.\" Haworth said he feared the closure of the centre could be just the beginning. \"What happens to my colleagues in the field? To the counsellors working with cult victims? Are they next? People in Britain have died because they have been involved in cults.\"",

The IV Olympiad was to have been staged in Rome, but the eruption of Vesuvius in 1906 destroyed large parts of Naples and funds were diverted to rebuild the city. Luckily a young British sportsman and aristocrat, visiting Italy for a fencing competition, stepped forward and offered the services of his own country. That man was William Grenfell, Lord Desborough, and next month an exhibition at his former home, Taplow Court, near Maidenhead, will reveal how he and his freshly minted British Olympic Association managed to find a site, build a stadium and organise the finance to host teams from 22 visiting nations without much government help. Desborough, who had become an MP at 25, was a former \"double blue\" in rowing and running at Oxford. What is more, he had swum the rapids at Niagara twice and climbed the Matterhorn three times, to say nothing of representing his country at fencing, or of chairing the Lawn Tennis Association and the MCC. He was the original all-rounder. Although there was no Olympic torch at the 1908 Games, as the tradition did not start until 1928, on 10 July this summer the 2012 torch will pass by Taplow Court en route to the London Games in tribute to his sporting legacy. Desborough's pioneering games, staged at the White City in west London, is often remembered for such abortive events as \"motor boating\" (which saw stately competition speeds of up to 19mph \u2013 or would have done, if anything had been visible from the shore in Southampton), or the tug-of-war competition (also a doubtful success, with the winning team of Liverpool policemen criticised by opponents for wearing regulation steel-tipped boots). And yet many of the established rules of international sport were laid down at the 1908 Games, including the eccentric length of the standard marathon course (specially lengthened to finish by the royal box). It was also the first Olympics to see national teams compete against each other for points and medals. Great Britain and Ireland led the awards tables to the end, winning a total of 56 golds, but this sadly did not go on to establish an Olympic convention. The Games were held over six months, from April to October, with the main stadium events taking place between 13 and 25 July in a structure put up by the master builder George Wimpey for \u00a360,000 of government money, complete with running and cycling tracks, a wrestling and gymnastics platform and a 100ft by 15ft \"great bath\". The stadium could hold 68,000 seated spectators, with standing room for 23,000 more. Concerns over the weather and the price of tickets were shared with the 2012 Games. The 1908 Olympics eventually went down as the wettest in history, prompting the Observer to run a poem with these closing lines: But you, old sky, shall never falter, Nor lose your boasted fame; the beef of England's sons may alter, Her climate is the same. Whoever else is out of training, One backs you as a cert, For coming through the ruck and raining With one tremendous spurt! The Taplow exhibition will show the impact of Desborough's family on the 1908 Games. His wife, Ettie, was a renowned socialite, but also a fan of sport and cycling. Her two eldest sons, Julian and Billy, were keen sportsmen at Eton and at Oxford and attended the Games throughout. Later, Julian came to be celebrated for his stirring war poem, Into Battle, published in 1915. In 1910 Desborough said, with misplaced optimism: \"In the Games in London were assembled some 2,000 young men\u2026 representative of the generation into whose hands the destinies of most of the nations of the world are passing at this moment\u2026 and we hope that their meeting\u2026 may have a beneficial effect hereafter on the cause of international peace.\" Five years later the Grenfell brothers died on active duty within eight weeks of each other. A memorial sculpture was commissioned from the artist Sir Bertram Mackennal and still stands in Taplow's grounds. For the curator of the show, Angela Bolger, there is a nice connection between Desborough's thwarted hopes for the Games and the current owners of his home, the SGI-UK, the Buddhist group which runs Taplow Court as a research centre for peace studies. \"He was so concerned with the harnessing of hope and of goodwill between nations,\" said Bolger this weekend. Today international conferences are staged at Taplow Court, but during the Desboroughs' heyday it was a bolthole for an artistic aristocratic set known as The Souls. The house was visited by royalty, too, by writers such as HG Wells, and the dancer Isadora Duncan, who gave a performance on the lawn in Olympic year. While there were just under 2,000 male entrants in the games, 37 women also took part, competing in archery, tennis, ice skating and yachting. Three weeks before the Games opened, a \"monster meeting\" demanding votes for women took place in Hyde Park and the pressure applied by the suffragettes may have resulted in Lord Desborough becoming a vocal advocate for more \"ladies' events\" in future Olympics. But the most controversial element of the 1908 games was the aggrieved attitude of the American team. At the opening ceremony the American and Swedish flags were not flown and the Swedes stormed out of the stadium, while the Americans launched an official protest and deliberately failed to dip their flag to the royal box. American athletes also lodged complaints about the length of shorts and the presence of coaches on the track. They also understandably questioned the decision to give a gold medal to test cricketer Johnny Douglas in the middleweight boxing division. A final verdict on a split decision was called by the referee, Douglas's own father. Olympic history was made in the 400m when the Americans refused to take part in a re-run and Wyndham Halswelle had to take to the track alone. He remains the only British athlete to have the full collection of gold, silver and bronze medals [see footnote]. He was killed in 1915 by a sniper at Neuve Chapelle. The grand finale of the games was the marathon and this, too, made Olympic history. The favourite, Canadian Tom Longboat, collapsed at 19 miles after sipping champagne along the course, which started near Taplow at Windsor Castle. An Italian confectioner called Dorando Pietri then led the race all the way into the stadium, where he also succumbed to heat exhaustion, hastened perhaps by the brandy he used to refresh himself. He collapsed five times on the track and was helped across the line by supporters. After another official complaint, Pietri was disqualified and an American runner, Johnny Hayes, was given the gold. The Observer had looked forward to the marathon with the robust patriotism of the times. \"If the weather is fine, the finish of this Homeric struggle ought to be a magnificent scene. Whether the United Kingdom wins it or not, enough has been done to show that the complaints about the physical decadence of the Mother Country are for the most part clotted nonsense.\" \u2022 The following correction was published on 11 March 2012: A factbox headed \"Fraizer's Rise\" (Sport) wrongly maintained that Fraizer Campbell could not save Hull from relegation in 2007. Hull won promotion to the Premier League in 2008 when he set up Dean Windass to score against Bristol City. And \"Champagne marathons and tug-o'-wars\" (News) said Wyndham Halswelle \"remains the only British [Olympic] athlete to have the full collection of gold, silver and bronze medals\", but David Hemery and Mary Rand share the distinction as do fellow British Olympians Bradley Wiggins, Kathleen McKane Godfree and Josiah Ritchie.",

      "bodyText": "A small British publisher has acquired the UK rights to a Swedish novel that has become a European publishing phenomenon in the two years since major British and American firms rejected it. Hesperus Press, a London-based company with a staff of five, has bought the UK rights to 50-year-old Jonas Jonasson's \"laugh-out-loud funny, page-turning\" novel and is likely to show its bigger rivals how wrong they were to turn it down. The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared has already been sold to 30 countries. Thanks to word-of-mouth endorsements, sales in Sweden have exceeded a million. The German translation has sold more than 500,000 copies in four months and total translation sales are approaching two million. It is a picaresque story of a centenarian who escapes from his old people's home. While waiting for a bus, he steals a suitcase full of money belonging to a criminal gang, who chase him across Sweden. Along the way, the reader hears the story of his eventful life and the part that he played in some of the most significant events of the 20th century. A critic from a leading Dutch newspaper, Het Laatste Nieuws [see footnote], wrote of its \"hilarious highlights\" and a Danish newspaper reviewer likened it to Forrest Gump at the wheel. Film adaptations are also in the pipeline. A leading Nordic film company, Nice Entertainment, is developing a production and several Hollywood studios are negotiating the remake rights. Karl Sabbagh, managing director of Hesperus, described it as \"a real feelgood book \u2026 showing that Swedes can write light, amusing novels as well as dark thrillers about serial killers\". He acquired the rights after his Swedish stepmother raved about her holiday read. Fascinated by her enthusiasm, he tracked down the agent, Anna Solar-Pontas, and was astonished to discover that the rights were still available. While global English-language rights have been sold to Hyperion Books in the US, the British and Irish rights have gone to Hesperus. UK publication is set for 12 July to coincide with Hesperus's 10th anniversary. Until now, the publisher has focused on translations and minor classics, including lesser-known Charles Dickens's and early works by Jane Austen, generally selling no more than a few thousand copies. Sabbagh said: \"I managed to acquire it by convincing the agent that we were passionate about publishing it well, rather than by paying the sort of huge advance that Hesperus has never paid in its 10-year history.\" He was generous enough to defend his rivals' rejection of Jonasson's novel. Noting the general assumption that foreign literature in translation does not sell well, he said the original translation was particularly poor. A new one has been commissioned. There are, however, enough translations of foreign literature \u2013 notably Hans Fallada's Alone in Berlin, which became a worldwide bestseller \u2013 to show publishers that readers are not as parochial as they once were. Jonasson worked as a journalist and television producer before starting a new life as a writer, living on an island with his four-year-old son and his hens. He told the Observer he had waited 47 years before he felt \"mature enough to dare\" to write his first novel. Asked about the extraordinary interest across Europe, he said: \"It is unreal \u2026 it can go to your head.\" In his own life, the experience of a \"tragic divorce\" and custody battle \"kept me on the ground\". \u2022 The following correction was published on 18 March 2012: Identity crises: the actor Bruno Ganz is Swiss, not German (\"They can be funny, sweet and flippant\", In Focus); the sculptor Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966) was Swiss, not Italian (\"The man who stood witness for the world\", New Review); Het Laatste Nieuws is a Belgian newspaper, not a Dutch one (\"Bestseller joins the Nordic invasion of Britain\", News) and we described RTBF as a French TV channel, when it is a French-speaking Belgian TV station (\"Hazard lights up on the Spurs radar\", Sport).",

      "bodyText": "For Alex James, the bassist from Blur who turned cheesemaker, it was the dream that became a nightmare. For a weekend last September, he gave over his luscious farm in the Cotswolds to a festival celebrating his two great loves: food and music. KT Tunstall and the Feeling played, while chefs such as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Yotam Ottolenghi gave cookery demonstrations. More than 7,000 people attended each day, including the cream of the so-called Chipping Norton set. Jeremy Clarkson rolled up in his Range Rover, disgraced News International supremo Rebekah Brooks was there and even David Cameron, the prime minister, attended, baby Florence strapped to his chest in a harness as he browsed the street-food stalls. Alex James Presents Harvest was deemed a success \u2013 until a couple of days later, when the company behind the festival, Big Wheel Promotions, announced that it was in difficulties, with creditors later reported to be owed close to \u00a31m. Since then, save for a terse statement, James has remained silent while abuse has been heaped upon him, both in the press and social media. Finally, this weekend he spoke about the financial collapse, which not only cost him money but left friends in both the music and food businesses, neighbours in the Cotswolds and even a local primary school out of pocket. \"The fact that people didn't get paid really, really upset me,\" he said. \"But I had to follow legal procedures and unfortunately that meant not talking about it.\" The festival on James's farm was a sister event to Harvest at Jimmy's, a similar food and music festival that had been run for two years by Big Wheel on the Suffolk farm of broadcaster and farmer Jimmy Doherty. Many of those involved in that festival also remain unpaid. \"I had looked at the event at Jimmy's and they seemed to have a good business,\" said James. \"Although I was simply giving my land for the festival, my major concern was making sure that, as I was seen as the host, everybody involved was paid on time.\" Ticket sales were strong and the response positive. \"It was the best party I'd ever been to.\" Within a week, however, the company announced that it was in trouble. \"They told me sponsors hadn't paid up and that the losses were substantial. I was shocked.\" While some staff and performers were paid in advance, many others were left with huge unpaid bills. Among them was Kingham primary school, which received only half of the \u00a314,000 it had been promised for arranging a festival of local bands. The money was to go towards the salary of a music teacher at the school. After the collapse, Ed Read, the headteacher, said the school might not be able to fill that staff post. However, in December, a concert was staged in Chipping Norton to settle the debt. \"I pledged to match the funds raised from my own pocket,\" James says, '\"and we managed to return most of the money. I was very happy to do that.\" Others have not been so fortunate. Ottolenghi received just a few hundred pounds of the \u00a32,000 he was owed. \"I was surprised because it was a well-run event,\" he said. \"The money was not such a big deal for me, but I was concerned about the many other people who worked on it and were relying on full payment.\" The catering company Blanch &amp; Shock was \u00a38,000 out of pocket. \"In business terms it's the worst thing that's ever happened to us,\" said the firm's Mike Knowlden. \"Although I did think Alex could have been more supportive in his statements, I understood there were legal constraints. My anger is mostly directed at Big Wheel.\" James acknowledges how furious many of those involved have been. Although he did receive part-payment upfront, it did not, he says, compensate for the work he put into the festival. '\"It wasn't about the money I lost. It's just a mess. It was easily the worst business deal I've ever done. I'm gutted that some people didn't get paid.\" A spokesman for Big Wheel said that, by going into a company voluntary arrangement, it was attempting to make sure creditors received at least 20% of the money they were owed. \"Big Wheel Promotions has been responsible in trying to ensure all the people involved are compensated as much as we can for all their hard work. We are trying to honour our commitments to both them and the local community. We have not just walked away.\"",

      "body": "<p>For Alex James, the bassist from Blur who turned cheesemaker, it was the dream that became a nightmare. For a weekend last September, he gave over his luscious farm in the Cotswolds to a festival celebrating his two great loves: food and music. KT Tunstall and the Feeling played, while chefs such as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Yotam Ottolenghi gave cookery demonstrations.</p> <p>More than 7,000 people attended each day, including the cream of the so-called Chipping Norton set. Jeremy Clarkson rolled up in his Range Rover, disgraced News International supremo Rebekah Brooks was there and even David Cameron, the prime minister, attended, baby Florence strapped to his chest in a harness as he browsed the street-food&#xa0;stalls.</p> <p>Alex James Presents Harvest was deemed a success \u2013 until a couple of days later, when the company behind the festival, Big Wheel Promotions, announced that it was in difficulties, with creditors later reported to be owed close to \u00a31m.</p> <p>Since then, save for a terse statement, James has remained silent while abuse has been heaped upon him, both in the press and social media. Finally, this weekend he spoke about the financial collapse, which not only cost him money but left friends in both the music and food businesses, neighbours in the Cotswolds and even a local primary school out of pocket. \"The fact that people didn't get paid really, really upset me,\" he said. \"But I had to follow legal procedures and unfortunately that meant not talking about it.\"</p> <p>The festival on James's farm was a sister event to Harvest at Jimmy's, a similar food and music festival that had been run for two years by Big Wheel on the Suffolk farm of broadcaster and farmer Jimmy Doherty. Many of those involved in that festival also remain unpaid.</p> <p>\"I had looked at the event at Jimmy's and they seemed to have a good business,\" said James. \"Although I was simply giving my land for the festival, my major concern was making sure that, as I was seen as the host, everybody involved was paid on time.\"</p> <p>Ticket sales were strong and the response positive. \"It was the best party I'd ever been to.\" Within a week, however, the company announced that it was in trouble. \"They told me sponsors hadn't paid up and that the losses were substantial. I was shocked.\"</p> <p>While some staff and performers were paid in advance, many others were left with huge unpaid bills. Among them was Kingham primary school, which received only half of the \u00a314,000 it had been promised for arranging a festival of local bands. The money was to go towards the salary of a music teacher at the school. After the collapse, Ed Read, the headteacher, said the school might not be able to fill that staff post.</p> <p>However, in December, a concert was staged in Chipping Norton to settle the debt. \"I pledged to match the funds raised from my own pocket,\" James says, '\"and we managed to return most of the money.

      "bodyText": "Has the behemoth had its day? After years of relentless expansion, the UK's biggest retailer, Tesco, last week saw its market share fall to the lowest level since 2005. The supermarket gained the upper hand over its rivals by ambitiously opening ever-larger stores across the country. That strategy may now be coming back to bite it. As internet shopping becomes ever more popular, hypermarkets and enormous warehouse-style stores are beginning to look as futuristic as the woolly mammoth. When you can order online for delivery to your home, why spend money on expensive petrol to drive to a cavernous store and drag the kids along aisles as long as a football pitch in search of items that may not be in stock? In January, when Tesco delivered a shock profits warning, chief executive Phil Clarke indicated that the days of massive new stores were over. He told reporters: \"Do you need to build large hypermarkets in the UK when the internet is taking so much growth in electricals, in clothing, in general merchandise?\" Industry insiders say that it was probably a mistake for any supermarket to open stores over 60,000-70,000 sq ft, as it is becoming a challenge to fill them with enticing products when many things sell better online. Most supermarkets do not offer a particularly inspiring shopping experience or well-informed staff. Their main selling points are convenience, reliability and price. The internet has ratcheted up competition on all those measures, particularly in music, electrical goods, books and even clothing. Of course supermarkets are not alone. Retailers across the UK are realising that they have too much physical space. The economic downturn, which has dampened retail sales growth, has only exaggerated a strategic shift towards the internet. Consultancy Verdict Research says online sales have more than doubled to \u00a326.3bn in the last five years and will rise to \u00a340bn by 2015. The pace of change has varied dramatically for retailers in different sectors. The most dramatic shift is in music and film retail where more than half of physical products, not including downloads, are now sold online, according to Verdict. HMV has announced the closure of 40 stores while rivals Music Zone, Virgin and Borders have all disappeared from the high street. Electricals stores are also under pressure with just over a quarter of their goods, from washing machines to hi-fis, now sold online. US retailer Best Buy pulled out of the UK last year closing all 11 stores while rival Comet was sold for just \u00a32 and Dixons Retail, which owns Currys and PC World, saw underlying sales in the UK and Ireland fall by 7% for the 12 weeks to 7 January. In fashion, just 9% of sales are online, according to Verdict, yet several retailers including Philip Green's Arcadia group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Bhs, are looking at store closures. Big department stores like Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis, House of Fraser and Debenhams are fighting back against online competition with clever multi-channel strategies. New services are merging the physical and virtual shopping experience such as \"click and collect\", where shoppers can order online and pick up in a store of their choice and \"quick response\" (QR) labels which, if scanned with a smartphone, can take shoppers straight to a mobile online store to get information or make a purchase. Some stores, such as Apple and House of Fraser, are experimenting with giving staff mobile internet devices such as iPads so that they are better able to answer queries from shoppers who now have access to a wealth of information via their mobile phone. House of Fraser and rival John Lewis are also trying out much smaller stores supported by internet kiosks which give the opportunity to buy and get delivered a bigger range of products beyond those on display. Even in DIY, where less than 6% of sales go online, retailers are preparing themselves for the future. DIY giant B&amp;Q revealed last week that it is to refurbish its entire 358-store estate to improve the experience for shoppers. It is also investing heavily in internet and multi-channel services. Ian Cheshire, chief executive, says: \"Everyone has got to worry about the internet. Our biggest single investment in the UK is going to be multi-channel systems and infrastructure this year. If you are not investing in that you are going to be in trouble.\" Supermarkets have not ignored online retailing. Tesco and rivals Asda, Sainsbury's and Waitrose all offer groceries and non-food online with \"click and collect\" services. They have been able to attract new shoppers to buy a massive range of fashion, homewares and electricals online, some of which does not appear in their stores. All the major supermarkets are also rapidly expanding into small local stores to take advantage of the trend towards more frequent small shopping trips rather than a weekly blow-out at a hypermarket. Judith McKenna, chief operating officer, at Asda says: \"People are shopping at large hypermarkets less frequently. That's partly because of the internet but also because they don't want to spend money on driving out there. We've recognised that change and that is why we are opening more small local stores that offer convenience.\" But those grocers have also been unwilling to give up on their addiction to new physical space. Supermarkets were working on the development of 40% more new space in the first half of 2011 than they were in 2008 according to property company CBRE, all offering more room for general merchandise. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy Conlumino, says the supermarkets, and particularly Tesco, need to switch their focus into investing in their existing portfolio rather than opening new stores. \"Although you may think people go for the lowest price, most people are questioning whether to buy things at all at the moment and they need cajoling or inspiring into spending. If the setting is not interesting or inspirational it's easy to leave an item on the shelf,\" he says. All supermarkets have been slow to realise that shoppers now want more from a store, but Saunders says: \"Tesco was more aggressive than anyone else in opening new space and so they have found themselves with more of an issue than a lot of other retailers.\" Tesco has clearly recognised it has a problem. Last week it announced plans to spend \u00a3300m on improving its stores and customer service. Ideas include beauty counters, electrical sales areas similar to the popular Apple stores and healthy eating centres similar to Holland &amp; Barrett. It will take some effort to improve the stores but there is every chance for Tesco to succeed. For all the hype about the internet, physical stores remain important, claiming 90% of all retail sales. Physical retailers offer more flexibility, excitement and convenience than pure-play online stores. Even Amazon, the world's most successful online retailer, has its own struggles. The retailer has warned that it expects to make a full-year loss this year. While music and books can be delivered digitally or popped through the letterbox, there is a whole range of products that are much trickier to deliver to a home. It's much easier to pick up clothing, DIY equipment or big electrical goods from a store. McKenna at Asda says: \"People browse in store but might choose to shop online. You have to think of a joined up offer.\" Enormous stores may need rethinking, but they are unlikely to become extinct in the near future.",

      "bodyText": "Lucien Engelen is director of the Radboud REshape &amp; Innovation Centre at Radboud University Nijmegen medical centre in the Netherlands. His work looks at how new technologies can change patient care models in the context of rising demand for healthcare, shortages of skilled staff and restrictive budgets. He is organising TEDxMaastricht \"The Future of Health\" on 2 April. How could social networks be used to improve healthcare provision? We tend not to use the biggest resource in healthcare \u2013 the patients themselves. So I'm trying to figure out possible uses for digital technologies like Facebook but also real-life social networks to improve healthcare provision. How have we got to this position, where patients aren't listened to? Over the past decades we have tended to take healthcare away from the people themselves. This started with bringing people into hospitals rather than caring for them in their homes. Healthcare has become centralised in institutions, rather than in networks as it was in the old days. But new technology is enabling us to reverse that, while keeping the same high standards. For example? I wanted patients to be able to talk to their physician via video much like they would via Skype \u2013 however Skype is not secure enough for healthcare legislative standards. There are video conferencing systems but they require dedicated hardware. So we designed a hardware-free system. This means that patients who would normally have to visit their physician four times a month, for example, can know do three of these consultations via video. What do doctors think about this? Doctors are aware of the challenges of double health care demand \u2013 the idea that, mainly because of demographic changes, the demand on healthcare professionals over the next 20 years will double. Moreover their budgets are frozen and there are shortages of skilled personnel, so we have to come up with smart solutions. This is one of the examples that could help to make healthcare provision affordable and easier. Older people are big users of healthcare. Are you concerned that some might not want to use computers? It's a misconception that people over 65 do not use computers. They love them, they are always consulting Dr Google. You recently conducted a project for young cancer patients\u2026 At the hospital we have a hang-out spot for young cancer patients, with internet and coffee and someone to talk to about problems \u2013 for example problems at work, or how to get finance. They asked us to set up an online version, so they could interact with each other when they weren't undergoing chemotherapy. So we built a secure online community called AYA4 (\"all information you have ever asked for\") for young Dutch cancer patients. The nice thing is that in this online community there are no physicians or nurses, we just have a community manager to answer technical queries. There is a button for medical questions, which are sent directly to an oncologist who answers back to the community. The users love it. They can talk about their health problems, which they can't on Twitter. We can point them to the right information about their cancer, so they get peace of mind. The community includes information about diet, finance, law etc, and they give us feedback on how we could do a better job. We are now rolling it out to six other hospitals in the Netherlands. You have also built an app so users can report the location of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) throughout Holland\u2026 Yes, at present we have 17,000 locations and we are in contact with 10 other institutions to set up maps in their countries. No one is registering their AEDs \u2013 I can buy one and no one knows I have it. The Dutch Red Cross is helping us validate the locations, so over time the database will become more accurate. Then if a someone you are with has a cardiac problem you can use the app to find the nearest AED, saving valuable time. You also tried uploading your weight to Google health and tweeting it every morning\u2026 Yes I was flabbergasted by the reaction. People would say \"Lucien you should have a light lunch today\" \u2013 it was peer pressure. Setting this up in closed communities for obese people or people who want to stop smoking could help them stay more healthy. Privacy is a controversial topic and health data is particularly sensitive\u2026 I think we overestimate this \u2013 youngsters are far less engaged with privacy than people of a mature age. They share a lot of things that you and I would get grey hair about. But we need more legislation to guide it. What do we do with this incredible amount of health data? That is a real challenge. We need new ways of finding our way through it. On the intersection between big data and narration is where we can really change healthcare for the better. You want people to take control of their own health? Only if they want to. If they want to but they can't, we will teach them. If they want to but they can't because there is no system or technology, we will build it for them. But if they don't want to we will deliver healthcare in the regular way. Some people think it is one way or the other, but it's not.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://lucienengelen.posterous.com/\" title=\"\">Lucien Engelen</a> is director of the <a href=\"http://www.radboudreshapecenter.com/\" title=\"\">Radboud REshape &amp; Innovation Centre</a> at Radboud University Nijmegen medical centre in the Netherlands. His work looks at how new technologies can change patient care models in the context of rising demand for healthcare, shortages of skilled staff and restrictive budgets. He is organising <a href=\"http://www.tedxmaastricht.com/\" title=\"\">TEDxMaastricht \"The Future of Health\" on 2 April</a>.</p> <p><strong>How could social networks be used to improve healthcare provision?</strong></p> <p>We tend not to use the biggest resource in healthcare \u2013 the patients themselves. So I'm trying to figure out possible uses for digital technologies like Facebook but also real-life social networks to improve healthcare provision.</p> <p><strong>How have we got to this position, where patients aren't listened to?</strong></p> <p>Over the past decades we have tended to take healthcare away from the people themselves. This started with bringing people into hospitals rather than caring for them in their homes. Healthcare has become centralised in institutions, rather than in networks as it was in the old days. But new technology is enabling us to reverse that, while keeping the same high standards.</p> <p><strong>For example?</strong></p> <p>I wanted patients to be able to talk to their physician via video much like they would via Skype \u2013 however Skype is not secure enough for healthcare legislative standards. There are video conferencing systems but they require dedicated hardware. So we designed a hardware-free system. This means that patients who would normally have to visit their physician four times a month, for example, can know do three of these consultations via video.</p> <p><strong>What do doctors think about this?</strong></p> <p>Doctors are aware of the challenges of double health care demand \u2013 the idea that, mainly because of demographic changes, the demand on healthcare professionals over the next 20 years will double. Moreover their budgets are frozen and there are shortages of skilled personnel, so we have to come up with smart solutions. This is one of the examples that could help to make healthcare provision affordable and easier.</p> <p><strong>Older people are big users of healthcare. Are you concerned that some might not want to use computers?</strong></p> <p>It's a misconception that people over 65 do not use computers. They love them, they are always consulting Dr&#xa0;Google.</p> <p><strong>You recently conducted a </strong><a href=\"http://lucienengelen.posterous.com/young-cancer-patients-develop-online-communit\" title=\"\"><strong>project for young cancer patients</strong></a><strong>\u2026</strong></p> <p>At the hospital we have a hang-out spot for young cancer patients, with internet and coffee and someone to talk to about problems \u2013 for example problems at work, or how to get finance. They asked us to set up an online version, so they could interact with each other when they weren't undergoing chemotherapy. So we built a secure online community called AYA4 (\"all information you have ever asked for\") for young Dutch cancer patients. The nice thing is that in this online community there are no physicians or nurses, we just have a community manager to answer technical queries. There is a button for medical questions, which are sent directly to an oncologist who answers back to the community.</p> <p>The users love it. They can talk about their health problems, which they can't on Twitter. We can point them to the right information about their cancer, so they get peace of mind. The community includes information about diet, finance, law etc, and they give us feedback on how we could do a better job. We are now rolling it out to six other hospitals in the Netherlands.</p> <p><strong>You have also built an app so users can report the </strong><a href=\"http://www.aed4.eu/\" title=\"\"><strong>location of automated external defibrillators (AEDs)</strong></a><strong> throughout Holland\u2026</strong></p> <p>Yes, at present we have 17,000 locations and we are in contact with 10 other institutions to set up maps in their countries. No one is registering their AEDs \u2013 I can buy one and no one knows I have it. The Dutch Red Cross is helping us validate the locations, so over time the database will become more accurate. Then if a someone you are with has a cardiac problem you can use the app to find the nearest AED, saving valuable time.</p> <p><strong>You also tried uploading your weight to Google health and tweeting it every morning\u2026</strong></p> <p>Yes I was flabbergasted by the reaction. People would say \"Lucien you should have a light lunch today\" \u2013 it was peer pressure. Setting this up in closed communities for obese people or people who want to stop smoking could help them stay more healthy.</p> <p><strong>Privacy is a controversial topic and health data is particularly sensitive\u2026</strong></p> <p>I think we overestimate this \u2013 youngsters are far less engaged with privacy than people of a mature age. They share a lot of things that you and I would get grey hair about. But we need more legislation to guide it.</p> <p><strong>What do we do with this incredible amount of health data?</strong></p> <p>That is a real challenge. We need new ways of finding our way through it. On the intersection between big data and narration is where we can really change healthcare for the better.</p> <p><strong>You want people to take control of their own health?</strong></p> <p>Only if they want to. If they want to but they can't, we will teach them. If they want to but they can't because there is no system or technology, we will build it for them. But if they don't want to we will deliver healthcare in the regular way. Some people think it is one way or the other, but it's not.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A neon sign spells out Azealia Banks's name atop a bowl of noodles, in the style of a New York Chinese takeaway. When the latest US hip-hop sensation walks onstage, detonating a confetti cannon, her slight frame is wrapped in a blue Chinese dress and strafed by hair extensions worthy of Rapunzel. As yet, she is probably bigger over here than she is over there. Banks has just finished opening NME's new bands tour; this sold-out show is Banks's second headline slot in the capital since last autumn, when her track \"212\" went viral. Much is expected of this remarkable Harlem rapper. Recently signed to Universal, she has played a gig for Karl Lagerfeld and announced a debut album for the autumn. Entitled Broke With Expensive Tastes, Banks has been working on it with the help of Paul Epworth (Adele, Florence Welch) and, Twitter has it, MIA. Tonight, though, that album seems both promising and still in development. The sound quality is patchy, and her half-hour set seems more \"hip niche\" than it does a bid for mainstream stardom. But there is no denying Azealia Banks's appeal. Like Nicki Minaj, Banks has swiftly become infamous for having a mouth so filthy that she probably needs an industrial pressure hose to brush her teeth. You suspect many people are here to shout out one gloriously provocative line in \"212\", \"I guess that cunt gettin' eaten!\" This brand of fierce-girl filth, all penile put-downs and catty call-outs, is nothing new. It has been the template for most female rappers passim bar Missy Elliott, who managed to squirrel a little surreality into the game. Somehow, though, the smiley, mischievous, stage-schooled Banks has brought a freshness to these motions, like a bratty little sister who is smarter, smuttier and more versatile than you'd feared. Banks's flow is fast and thick with complex riffs on assonance; she can also whip out a cover of \"Valerie\", the Zutons song made famous by Amy Winehouse. Where Minaj has pioneered a cartoon hyper-sexuality, tonight Banks is channelling a kitsch chic that's every bit as metropolitan and internationalist as it is urban. Banks's DJ, Cosmo, is from the electronic music hub of Montreal and the beats bubbling around her verbiage hail from all corners of the digital map. After a furious opening a cappella called \"Grandslam\" in which Banks mocks men with language-bending vowel flurries, \"Fuck Up the Fun\" finds her machine-gunning to hollow slapping rhythms that summon up both Brazil and Baltimore. Later, \"Bambi\" proffers a less successful ravey European nightclub fusion. \"Licorice\" \u2013 an inter-racial come-hither with a sordidly sweet tooth \u2013 is stark house music with a nagging sung hook. It signposts one possible path forward into commerce. New Jersey's Sharon Van Etten hasn't had anywhere near as much attention as Banks. Despite her relative lack of dick metaphors, however, this singer-songwriter has made an equally assured start to 2012. Sex does figure \u2013 \"It might be I always give out,\" Van Etten sighs at the end of \"Give Out\" \u2013 but finely wrought dissections of emotional states dominate. Van Etten's star has risen more surreptitiously than Banks's, with the help of Bon Iver (who covered one of her old songs) and the National's Aaron Dessner, a Brooklyn indie-rock enabler of some note who produced her most recent album. Emotionally saturated and dense with circular patterns of guitar, Tramp has accrued rave reviews. On the first night of her UK tour, its heady thrum is recreated with the help of an omnichord and a full band who swap instruments and self-deprecating anecdotes. Backing vocalist Heather Woods Broderick is pivotal, adding more velvet to Van Etten's gliding vocals. Confessional indie rock can be dull, po-faced and samey, but tonight Van Etten and her band display a hypnotic, off-kilter shimmer like that which Throwing Muses once brought to the alternative rock of the late 80s. And \"Serpents\", their most seething three minutes, finds Van Etten at her most aggressive and forthright: \"You enjoy sucking on dreams,\" she sneers, \"so I will fall asleep with someone other than you.\"",

      "bodyText": "When MPs call on shareholders to rein in runaway executive pay, and the public wonders in exasperation why investors in RBS didn't tame Fred Goodwin's overweening ambition, or block the American takeover of Cadbury, they probably imagine a group of enlightened owners carefully shepherding the firms they control. The reality of today's equity markets is very different. Deep-seated structural forces favour hands-off ownership, short-term myopic decision-making and quick sell-outs. The interim report by the Kay review of Equity Markets, chaired by economist John Kay and published last week, set out the problem perfectly. According to Kay, there was a striking consensus among the hundreds of experts who responded to his review about the kind of role shareholders ought to play in UK plc \u2013 and similarly strong agreement that we are a very long way away from it. In fact, as Kay explains, this idea of \"stewardship\" is far from the reality of today's economy. Share ownership in UK plc is widely dispersed; a growing proportion of trades are executed automatically by computer; and fund managers often have to account for their performance each quarter, despite the fact many of their clients, not least pension fund members, are only interested in returns over a much longer period. All this tends to militate against investors spending time building up an intimate knowledge of the firms they own, and thinking about their long-term strategy. As Kay says, some shareholders take a long-term perspective and are closely engaged with the companies they hold stakes in; many others are not. Tellingly, former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy told the review he had \"missed the opportunity\" for more constructive engagement with his shareholders. David Swensen, who manages Yale University's $16bn endowment fund, says he likes to \"kick the tyres\" of the businesses in which he takes a stake; but many fund managers go nowhere near the companies they invest in. The ultimate owners, often pension fund beneficiaries, are even more removed. There are many reasons for the lack of a culture of stewardship by the owners of today's companies; but Vince Cable, who commissioned the report, has rightly identified it as one of the bugbears of the British economy. Kay takes aim at two of the treasured fixed beliefs of financial markets. The first is the idea that investors must be treated equally. Firms with two classes of shareholders used to be common, and still exist in the US: for instance News International, where the Murdoch family holds a minority stake, but a majority of the so-called B shares that carry voting rights. But in the UK, the notion of treating one group of shareholders differently has become anathema. Kay signals that it may be time for that to change. Perhaps, for example, the short-term \"arbitrageurs\" who pile into shares after a corporate bid is announced and can then help push through a takeover could be denied voting rights. But as Kay suggests, \"the principle of a qualifying period before voting rights are acquired might be applied generally, and not just in the context of a takeover.\" Placing short-term traders at a disadvantage to longer-term investors would be controversial; but it could start to sow the seeds of a cultural change in the City. The second, perhaps even more cherished, principle that Kay appears willing to ditch is quarterly reporting: the idea that companies, and the asset managers who buy and sell many of their shares, must produce a deluge of information every three months about their financial performance. In theory, quarterly reporting enhances transparency and focuses bosses' minds on the sacred idea of \"shareholder value\". But as became clear during the credit crisis, what's good for the share price in the short term isn't necessarily to the benefit of the company, let alone the wider economy, in the long run. The tyranny of chasing the quarterly numbers can cloud more considered strategic thinking, and has helped to spawn the byzantine executive pay schemes that claim to align bosses' interests with those of the shareholders but can end up rewarding them handsomely for meaningless financial engineering, for instance tarting a firm up for sale to a ruthless foreign predator, or for driving their company to the edge of a cliff and baling out just in time. Even Jack Welch, the legendary GE boss regarded as the father of the idea of \"shareholder value\", has since disowned his offspring, telling the FT three years ago that he now regarded chasing quarterly returns as \"the dumbest idea in the world\". \"Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy,\" he said. \"Your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products.\" Abandoning quarterly reporting would seem like a backward step if you assume that more information must always be a good thing; but short-term targets will inevitably distort decision-making. In the worst cases, as Enron's sorry tale showed, the frenzied pursuit of \"the number\" can lead to outright fraud. But even in the best, it can lead to the corporate equivalent of the kind of initiative-itis that afflicts chancellors when there's a budget in the offing. Judging by these musings, Kay is ready to think the unthinkable about the inner workings of capitalism, UK style. The cult of boardroom excess that's built up over 20 years, the desperate bailout of the financial sector that once accounted for a major chunk of FTSE100, and the sell-off of many of our proudest firms is ample evidence that such a fundamental rethink is long overdue.",

But even in the best, it can lead to the corporate equivalent of the kind of initiative-itis that afflicts chancellors when there's a budget in the offing.</p> <p>Judging by these musings, Kay is ready to think the unthinkable about the inner workings of capitalism, UK style. The cult of boardroom excess that's built up over 20 years, the desperate bailout of the financial sector that once accounted for a major chunk of FTSE100, and the sell-off of many of our proudest firms is ample evidence that such a fundamental rethink is long overdue.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is a frenzy out there,\" says Tracy Kellett, a buying agent who searches London and the south-east for properties for her well-off clients. \"I said prime London would go up 5% this year, but I think it is already up that much.\" Almost five years after the first stirrings of the credit crisis, Britain's housing market is deeply divided. The price crash that many analysts had predicted failed to materialise; but while Kellett struggles to find enough properties to sate the appetites of wealthy buyers in the capital, much of the rest of the country remains deep in the doldrums. \"There is definitely a London story versus the rest of the country. It is London which has done better over the last year or so while many parts of the country have seen prices fall,\" says Martin Ellis of the Halifax. Kellett recently viewed a two-bed property at \u00a31.25m. After 80 viewings in two days, it has attracted bids of more than \u00a31.6m, and the agent has advised that the seller will only consider cash offers. In the price bracket where many of her clients are searching \u2013 \u00a31m to \u00a32m \u2013 she says the market is booming. Most of these properties are in Kensington and Chelsea, Mayfair or Knightsbridge \u2013 neighbourhoods in London that are central, boast some of the capital's swankiest shops and restaurants and, say agents, have developed some cachet abroad thanks to their association with Princess Diana. According to the Land Registry, prices in these areas are up by 9% year-on-year. The average is still below \u00a31m, but there are many for sale for much, much more. Wealthy British buyers are vying with overseas investors who see sterling as a safe haven during the euro crisis. \"London offers a unique mix of attributes that few other places in the world have,\" says Mohamed Nurmohamed, director of the Mayfair branch of estate agents Chesterton Humberts. \"There's a reasonably responsible government, the fiscal plan does seem to be working, we have a very transparent legal system when it comes to property, we fare well on transaction costs \u2013 and, of course, you can set up a tax-free vehicle to hold the property.\" These are not the kind of investors you see elsewhere in the UK: they do not need income, just a safe place for their capital. They will typically stay in the property for a few weeks each year, and leave it empty the rest of the time. The hassle of dealing with tenants is not for them. As well as money coming in from new buyers, Nurmohamed says he is seeing existing clients snapping up properties for their extended family \u2013 in one block in Mayfair, the same family owns four multimillion-pound apartments. \"We do have buyers on our books who are looking specifically to add to that prime holiday home.\" David Adams of estate agents John Taylor says he has seen clients \"buying second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth properties \u2013 they buy one for them and then one for the kids.\" Recently he had a call on behalf of a buyer asking if he had any houses for sale for \u00a330m. \"I had one at \u00a350m, so I said is there room for movement, and they said no \u2013 the other children had \u00a330m spent on their properties, so it wouldn't be fair.\" Typically, there are several boxes these homes need to tick, says Nurmohamed: \"A lot of the overseas investors buy the same kind of properties: they like lateral apartments [estate-agent-speak for flats on one floor], above ground floor, lock-up-and-leave \u2026 ideally with a porter and a lift.\" Depending on the buyer, security can also be important: agents talk of garages with bulletproof doors and properties with retina-scanning security at the front door. Often these types of fittings appeal to Russian buyers. The properties Adams is currently selling cost an average of \u00a312m, but he has one on the market for \u00a3120m. At the bottom end of his book, at around \u00a31.5m, your money could get you a two-bedroom pied-a-terre in a location such as Kensington or Chelsea with no garden. Higher up the market, things are much more luxurious, with bespoke bathrooms, kitchens and spa rooms. If you have \u00a330m or so to spare, you may even get great views alongside your state-of-the-art security and valet parking. But money doesn't always secure your heart's desire. Nurmohamed says: \"In Mayfair we've had people with \u00a330m who can't get what they want.\" This is a market where the seller is king \u2013 or often minor royalty \u2013 and to even get in to the most expensive properties to take a look, you may need to show your credentials. \"In some, very rare, cases people will prevent viewings unless they have evidence that the person can perform,\" says Nurmohamed. Sometimes, the swishest properties are off-market \u2013 that is, for sale, but not openly advertised. Adams says discretion is an important part of his work, as there are people who do not wish those around them to know they are selling. This may be because they don't want others to know about their finances, because they are famous and do not want their house splashed over the property pages, or because they are getting divorced. \"Sometimes a couple is divorcing and they will put the property on the market but don't want the kids to know. If they get the right price, they will sell up and the money will be split in the settlement, but if they don't, she will keep it as part of the settlement.\" Two hundred and fifty miles away, the story is very different in Hartlepool, whose fortunes seem to sum up commentators' talk of a two-track British housing market. The north-eastern town is struggling with rising unemployment as a result of public sector cuts and the loss of manufacturing jobs. On York Road, one of the main streets running through the town, the blinds are down at the huge branch of Whitegates estate agents, which closed two years ago. Further up the road, the window of Robinsons estate agents makes grim reading for sellers: at least one in three properties advertised has been reduced and on one, buyers are told: \"All serious offers considered.\" Across the road, Eden Estates is marketing homes at a guide price, and properties are being advertised for as little as \u00a310,000 in the Great North Property Auction. Hartlepool saw house prices fall by 17% in 2011, and despite a 0.5% rise in January they remain at an average of just \u00a378,623, compared with a peak of \u00a3113,352 in 2008. During the boom years, between 150 and 200 homes a month were selling, but since the end of 2008 that figure has only once hit 100, according to the Land Registry \u2013 and some properties have been on the market for all of that time. Ellis at the Halifax says the city is by no means alone. \"Although Hartlepool may be at the extreme, there are other places that have also seen steep drops, in the north-east and across northern England.\" Ed Stansfield, property economist at consultancy Capital Economics, says that while the downturn in the London market was short-lived, the correction is by no means over in much of the rest of the country. \"When you talk to people outside London, they say it's still going on,\" he says. The Hartlepool branch of Manners &amp; Harrison is buzzing with phone calls and activity, but manager Sharon Richardson admits things have been difficult. She says: \"I've been in the business 20 years and it's one of the hardest years I've done.\" One of the challenges has been educating sellers about what to expect. \"They come in and say, 'I saw on television, house prices are on the up', and we say, 'they're not on the up in Hartlepool, our prices are still falling'.\" As with the UK as a whole there are pockets that seem to be driving down the average. One terraced house in the centre sold for just \u00a320,000 last year, and there are many others on the market for less than \u00a330,000. \"First-time buyers are not interested in the town-centre terraces for the simple reason that investors buy them and they tenant them,\" says Kay Rhodes, branch manager for estate agent Reeds Rains. A price war between landlords has driven rents down, she says, leading to tenants who don't value the properties as much. \"Those who remain as owner-occupiers will cut their losses and go \u2013 and they will probably sell to an investor.\" One of these streets is Rydal Street, a road of 54 small terraced houses where three are to let, two are for sale by an agent and one boarded-up property is for sale by auction. According to the website Property Bee, one has been on the market since 2008, while another, on since 2011, has had its price cut from \u00a359,950 to \u00a347,950. They are the kind of homes that, in other towns, might be lived in by students, but there is no university here to supply that kind of tenant. Meanwhile, builders are still constructing new homes \u2013 some of which you can see from the end of the street. Just across the road, the Blakelock Gardens development has three-bedroom homes with en-suites, gardens and off-street parking starting at \u00a3104,950. It's easy to see why would-be buyers might decide to sit tight until they can afford one of those \u2013 and when the government's new scheme to back 95% mortgages on new-build properties is introduced later this month, they are likely to look even more attractive. In Hartlepool, buyers hold the cards: Richardson says some sellers accept cheeky offers \"because they are worried another buyer won't come along\". Lee Brown has just accepted an offer after 11 months of trying to sell his house in Seaton Carew on the outskirts of town. He put the property on the market last Easter because his family wanted a home with a bigger garden. By September he'd had \"minimal interest\" and just three viewings, so he switched estate agent and reduced his asking price from \u00a3209,950 to \u00a3205,950. But it took another price cut, to \u00a3185,950, before he got an offer \u2013 and that was \u00a310,000 below asking price. But the slow market has worked in his favour on the purchase: the sellers of the home his family fell in love with accepted a lower offer than originally agreed. And he is pragmatic about selling for \u00a330,000 less than he hoped. \"The final differential between the two is actually the same as it was a year ago. However, the agreed prices are significantly lower than both parties were probably happy with,\" he says. \"As we are not doing this to make money, I feel happy with the prices involved, as we are buying a family home that we will spend the next stage of our lives in.\"",

The hassle of dealing with tenants is not for them.</p> <p>As well as money coming in from new buyers, Nurmohamed says he is seeing existing clients snapping up properties for their extended family \u2013 in one block in Mayfair, the same family owns four multimillion-pound apartments. \"We do have buyers on our books who are looking specifically to add to that prime holiday home.\"</p> <p>David Adams of estate agents John Taylor says he has seen clients \"buying second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth properties \u2013 they buy one for them and then one for the kids.\" Recently he had a call on behalf of a buyer asking if he had any houses for sale for \u00a330m. \"I had one at \u00a350m, so I said is there room for movement, and they said no \u2013 the other children had \u00a330m spent on their properties, so it wouldn't be fair.\"</p> <p>Typically, there are several boxes these homes need to tick, says Nurmohamed: \"A lot of the overseas investors buy the same kind of properties: they like lateral apartments [estate-agent-speak for flats on one floor], above ground floor, lock-up-and-leave \u2026 ideally with a porter and a lift.\"</p> <p>Depending on the buyer, security can also be important: agents talk of garages with bulletproof doors and properties with retina-scanning security at the front door. Often these types of fittings appeal to Russian buyers.</p> <p>The properties Adams is currently selling cost an average of \u00a312m, but he has one on the market for \u00a3120m. At the bottom end of his book, at around \u00a31.5m, your money could get you a two-bedroom pied-a-terre in a location such as Kensington or Chelsea with no garden. Higher up the market, things are much more luxurious, with bespoke bathrooms, kitchens and spa rooms. If you have \u00a330m or so to spare, you may even get great views alongside your state-of-the-art security and valet parking.</p> <p>But money doesn't always secure your heart's desire. Nurmohamed says: \"In Mayfair we've had people with \u00a330m who can't get what they want.\"</p> <p>This is a market where the seller is king \u2013 or often minor royalty \u2013 and to even get in to the most expensive properties to take a look, you may need to show your credentials. \"In some, very rare, cases people will prevent viewings unless they have evidence that the person can perform,\" says Nurmohamed.</p> <p>Sometimes, the swishest properties are off-market \u2013 that is, for sale, but not openly advertised. Adams says discretion is an important part of his work, as there are people who do not wish those around them to know they are selling. This may be because they don't want others to know about their finances, because they are famous and do not want their house splashed over the property pages, or because they are getting divorced.</p> <p>\"Sometimes a couple is divorcing and they will put the property on the market but don't want the kids to know. If they get the right price, they will sell up and the money will be split in the settlement, but if they don't, she will keep it as part of the settlement.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386784528\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/2/1330693014192/Boarded-up-house-in-Hartl-001.jpg\" alt=\"Boarded-up house in Hartlepool\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some city-centre houses in Hartlepool have been on the market since 2008. Photograph: Hilary Osborne for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two hundred and fifty miles away, the story is very different in Hartlepool, whose fortunes seem to sum up commentators' talk of a two-track British housing market.</p> <p>The north-eastern town is struggling with rising unemployment as a result of public sector cuts and the loss of manufacturing jobs. On York Road, one of the main streets running through the town, the blinds are down at the huge branch of Whitegates estate agents, which closed two years ago. Further up the road, the window of Robinsons estate agents makes grim reading for sellers: at least one in three properties advertised has been reduced and on one, buyers are told: \"All serious offers considered.\"</p> <p>Across the road, Eden Estates is marketing homes at a guide price, and properties are being advertised for as little as \u00a310,000 in the Great North Property Auction.</p> <p>Hartlepool saw house prices fall by 17% in 2011, and despite a 0.5% rise in January they remain at an average of just \u00a378,623, compared with a peak of \u00a3113,352 in 2008. During the boom years, between 150 and 200 homes a month were selling, but since the end of 2008 that figure has only once hit 100, according to the Land Registry \u2013 and some properties have been on the market for all of that time.</p> <p>Ellis at the Halifax says the city is by no means alone. \"Although Hartlepool may be at the extreme, there are other places that have also seen steep drops, in the north-east and across northern England.\"</p> <p>Ed Stansfield, property economist at consultancy Capital Economics, says that while the downturn in the London market was short-lived, the correction is by no means over in much of the rest of the country. \"When you talk to people outside London, they say it's still going on,\" he says.</p> <p>The Hartlepool branch of Manners &amp; Harrison is buzzing with phone calls and activity, but manager Sharon Richardson admits things have been difficult. She says: \"I've been in the business 20 years and it's one of the hardest years I've done.\" One of the challenges has been educating sellers about what to expect. \"They come in and say, 'I saw on television, house prices are on the up', and we say, 'they're not on the up in Hartlepool, our prices are still falling'.\"</p> <p>As with the UK as a whole there are pockets that seem to be driving down the average. One terraced house in the centre sold for just \u00a320,000 last year, and there are many others on the market for less than \u00a330,000.</p> <p>\"First-time buyers are not interested in the town-centre terraces for the simple reason that investors buy them and they tenant them,\" says Kay Rhodes, branch manager for estate agent Reeds Rains. A price war between landlords has driven rents down, she says, leading to tenants who don't value the properties as much. \"Those who remain as owner-occupiers will cut their losses and go \u2013 and they will probably sell to an investor.\"</p> <p>One of these streets is Rydal Street, a road of 54 small terraced houses where three are to let, two are for sale by an agent and one boarded-up property is for sale by auction. According to the website Property Bee, one has been on the market since 2008, while another, on since 2011, has had its price cut from \u00a359,950 to \u00a347,950. They are the kind of homes that, in other towns, might be lived in by students, but there is no university here to supply that kind of tenant.</p> <p>Meanwhile, builders are still constructing new homes \u2013 some of which you can see from the end of the street. Just across the road, the Blakelock Gardens development has three-bedroom homes with en-suites, gardens and off-street parking starting at \u00a3104,950. It's easy to see why would-be buyers might decide to sit tight until they can afford one of those \u2013 and when the government's new scheme to back 95% mortgages on new-build properties is introduced later this month, they are likely to look even more attractive.</p> <p>In Hartlepool, buyers hold the cards: Richardson says some sellers accept cheeky offers \"because they are worried another buyer won't come along\".</p> <p>Lee Brown has just accepted an offer after 11 months of trying to sell his house in Seaton Carew on the outskirts of town. He put the property on the market last Easter because his family wanted a home with a bigger garden. By September he'd had \"minimal interest\" and just three viewings, so he switched estate agent and reduced his asking price from \u00a3209,950 to \u00a3205,950.</p> <p>But it took another price cut, to \u00a3185,950, before he got an offer \u2013 and that was \u00a310,000 below asking price. But the slow market has worked in his favour on the purchase: the sellers of the home his family fell in love with accepted a lower offer than originally agreed. And he is pragmatic about selling for \u00a330,000 less than he hoped.</p> <p>\"The final differential between the two is actually the same as it was a year ago. However, the agreed prices are significantly lower than both parties were probably happy with,\" he says. \"As we are not doing this to make money, I feel happy with the prices involved, as we are buying a family home that we will spend the next stage of our lives in.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Having clung on through the worst housing slump in decades, Britain's housebuilders are back in the black and their shares are again sought-after in the City. Taylor Wimpey, which nearly collapsed under its debts three years ago, swung to an annual profit last week and cheered investors by announcing its first dividend since 2007 \u2013 albeit just 0.38p a share. Persimmon, which owns the Westbury and Charles Church brands, went further and pledged to return \u00a31.9bn, or \u00a36.20 a share, to shareholders in the coming nine and a half years, sending its stock soaring. The housing boom saw housebuilders ramp up construction just as the financial crisis struck in 2008. Much chastened, they now seem happy building far fewer homes, with a shift away from apartments towards larger family houses. David Ritchie, chief executive of Bovis Homes, echoed the general feeling in the sector when he talked of static sales levels, flat prices and stagnant mortgage approvals being the \"new norm\" last week. \"The housing market is remarkably stable but at low levels of activity,\" he said. The extent of the general downturn in construction is illustrated by official figures showing new orders slumped to their lowest level since 1980 last year. The only sector in which orders rose was private housing, up 6%. The heady boom days of 2007 are clearly over, but all the listed housebuilders are profitable again. Analysts at Investec give the thumbs-up to the sector, which they say is \"huffing and puffing\" on the road to recovery. The firm's Mike Bessell says: \"What has really changed from 2008/2009 and even early 2010 is that housebuilders are in control of their destiny.\" Housebuilders have good reasons to be fairly optimistic. The UK housing shortage is apparently getting worse rather than better. By 2015 demand for housing will outstrip supply by more than 500,000 homes, according to the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), partly due to delays in the planning system. First-time buyers are still struggling to get on the housing ladder and the impact of this has been fewer homes being built, despite the pent-up demand, it argues. Just 115,000 permissions to build homes were granted in 2011, half the 2006 level and half the number required, according to building data firm Glenigan. Changes to the planning system will be crucial to how quickly homes can be built in future. The industry is anxiously awaiting the government's new national planning policy framework, due in weeks. The Home Builders Federation is calling on the government to resist the \"vocal anti-development lobby's scaremongering\". Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the civil service and permanent secretary to the communities department, last week confirmed that the framework would include a presumption in favour of sustainable development. Meanwhile, the FMB is urging the chancellor to use his budget to extend the stamp-duty holiday for first-time buyers on properties under \u00a3250,000, due to expire later this month. Even so, this year could be good for first-timers, if the government-underwritten NewBuy scheme is successful. From this month, it will allow people to get a mortgage with only a \u00a310,000 deposit for a newly built property priced up to \u00a3500,000. The prime minister has suggested this could help 100,000 would-be buyers who are struggling to raise the average deposit demanded by lenders of \u00a340,000, though critics argue that it is better news for builders than borrowers. Housebuilders are certainly rubbing their hands. Pete Redfern, chief executive of Taylor Wimpey, believes it could have a \"material impact\". \"Most of the major lenders will be involved,\" he says. \"The biggest constraint in the short term is mortgage availability.\" Mortgage approvals hit a 25-month high in January, but the worry is that first-time buyers are just trying to beat the end of the stamp duty holiday. Shared-equity schemes such as FirstBuy \u2013 where the government and the developer invest equal amounts and the buyer only has to contribute a cash deposit of 5% \u2013 have also underpinned demand. Housebuilders have also improved returns by snapping up land without planning permission cheaply and paying for it only after getting the green light for development. In some cases, they even buy farmland at agricultural prices and let it back out. So is everything tickety-boo again? Brokerage Collins Stewart thinks not. Housing analyst Alastair Stewart, one of the City's most bearish voices, has warned that UK housing could be stuck in a \"lost decade\", with mortgage lending, transactions and prices all likely to fall this year. \"Housing could remain caught between weak consumer appetite for borrowing and banks' aversion to mortgage lending largely due to eurozone risks.\" He claims Britain's housing shortage is not as bad as it is purported to be, arguing that the housing stock has gone up by almost twice the rate of population growth since 1991. Steve Morgan, the outspoken chairman and founder of Redrow who also owns Premier League football club Wolverhampton Wanderers, dismisses this as a \"load of bollocks\" and others in the City cast doubt on Stewart's calculations, saying they do not appear to account for immigration, the trend towards one- and two-bedroom households, and removal of old houses. And Investec's Bessell does not expect any material shocks to house prices over the next couple of years. He says the housing market has already reached \"something of a nadir, with a very low level of activity which represents little, if anything, more than the transactions of the 'must movers' in the market\".",

      "bodyText": "Creating repertoire for a chamber ballet company is tricky. How do you ring the changes, given sparse resources and a mere handful of dancers? Ballet Black, now in their 11th year, have had successes and failures in this respect, but one choreographer who has consistently produced powerfully charged work for them is Martin Lawrance. Lawrance's background is in contemporary dance \u2013 he's probably the most distinguished of Richard Alston's choreographic disciples \u2013 and his work for the seven-strong company fiercely interrogates the classicism in which Ballet Black are grounded. Captured, a four-hander set to a taut string quartet by Shostakovich, deftly avoids structural cliche and leaves us wondering about the precise nature of the interactions between the two couples. What you take away, first and foremost, is the rangy, staccato attack of Cira Robinson. Not for her the silken path. Instead, as she prepares to launch into a searching jet\u00e9 or a string of pos\u00e9 turns to the scherzo's shuddering cellos, you see the eyes widen and the nostrils flare. Like Nureyev, she sees no reason to make ballet look easy. Captured's best sequence starts as an adagio duet for Damien Johnson and Joseph Poulton. Lawrance runs the sequence just long enough to establish its intimate, meditative mood, and then in swings Robinson with quite another agenda and turns the thing on its head. Ballet Black's dancers work against the grain. The more you ask of them, the more you get. And neither Jonathan Watkins nor Jonathan Goddard asks enough. Together Alone sees Sarah Kundi and Jazmon Voss stalking each other to a pallid composition by Alex Baranowski. Watkins knows his onions, choreographically speaking, but all those slow-motion walks and meaningful stares don't add up to much, and I found the soul-brother hip rolls a bit wince-making, in among the off-classicism. I know Alvin Ailey did this, back in the day, but that was then. Goddard's Running Silent is equally undemanding. A solo for apprentice dancer Kanika Carr, it seems to fall backwards in its determination to spare her serious technical challenge. Christopher Hampson's Storyville, however, hits the spot with charm and exactitude. The piece, set to music by Kurt Weill, and borrowing elements of The Threepenny Opera, tells the story of country girl Nola (Robinson), and her rise and fall in a New Orleans dance hall. Robinson is fetchingly naive as the corn-pone, cotton-frocked Nola, and Kundi is balefully sexy as her nemesis, Lulu White. Weill's music is something of a siren song to choreographers, and several have come to grief trying to turn his song cycles into dance. Hampson's light touch enables him to avoid the ponderous fatalism of his predecessors, and there's a nicely imagined sequence where Voss, as Mack the Knife, gives Robinson a diamond bracelet (shades of Kenneth MacMillan's Manon), and then promenades her with a hand ruthlessly clamped to her throat. As in Manon, Nola dies as she's lifted aloft by her lover (Johnson). Best, though, is the bittersweet enchantment of the opening and closing scenes, set to the haunting title song of Weill's musical Lost in the Stars, based on Alan Paton's novel of racial conflict and reconciliation, Cry the Beloved Country. Reminiscent in its simplicity of the choreography of Paul Taylor \u2013 the cast linked in a circle, hands aflutter \u2013 it's both affecting and appropriate.",

Instead, as she prepares to launch into a searching jet\u00e9 or a string of pos\u00e9 turns to the scherzo's shuddering cellos, you see the eyes widen and the nostrils flare. Like Nureyev, she sees no reason to make ballet look easy. <em>Captured</em>'s best sequence starts as an adagio duet for Damien Johnson and Joseph Poulton. Lawrance runs the sequence just long enough to establish its intimate, meditative mood, and then in swings Robinson with quite another agenda and turns the thing on its head.</p> <p>Ballet Black's dancers work against the grain. The more you ask of them, the more you get. And neither Jonathan Watkins nor Jonathan Goddard asks enough. <em>Together Alone</em> sees Sarah Kundi and Jazmon Voss stalking each other to a pallid composition by Alex Baranowski. Watkins knows his onions, choreographically speaking, but all those slow-motion walks and meaningful stares don't add up to much, and I found the soul-brother hip&#xa0;rolls a bit wince-making, in among&#xa0;the off-classicism. I know Alvin Ailey did this, back in the day, but&#xa0;that was then.</p> <p>Goddard's <em>Running Silent </em>is equally undemanding. A solo for apprentice dancer Kanika Carr, it seems to fall backwards in its determination to spare her serious technical challenge. Christopher Hampson's <em>Storyville</em>, however, hits the spot with charm and exactitude. The piece, set to music by Kurt Weill, and borrowing elements of <em>The Threepenny Opera</em>, tells the story of&#xa0;country girl Nola (Robinson), and her rise and fall in a New Orleans dance hall. Robinson is fetchingly naive as the corn-pone, cotton-frocked Nola, and Kundi is balefully sexy as her nemesis, Lulu White.</p> <p>Weill's music is something of a siren song to choreographers, and several have come to grief trying to turn his song cycles into dance. Hampson's light touch enables him to avoid the ponderous fatalism of his predecessors, and there's a nicely imagined sequence where Voss, as Mack the Knife, gives Robinson a diamond bracelet (shades of Kenneth MacMillan's <em>Manon</em>), and then promenades her with a hand ruthlessly clamped to her throat. As in <em>Manon</em>, Nola dies as she's lifted aloft by her lover (Johnson). Best, though, is the bittersweet enchantment of the opening and closing scenes, set to the haunting title song of Weill's musical <em>Lost in the Stars</em>, based on Alan Paton's novel of racial conflict and reconciliation, <em>Cry the Beloved Country</em>. Reminiscent in its simplicity of the choreography of Paul Taylor \u2013 the cast linked in a circle, hands aflutter \u2013 it's both affecting and appropriate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has been serving up an authentic taste of Britain's industrial past for almost a century, but the world's last traditional oatcake shop in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, a family-run business that operated out of the front room of a terraced house, is to close. Oatcakes \u2013 pancake-like wraps made from oatmeal \u2013 have been served through the front window of the end-of-terrace house since the 1920s, but owner Glenn Fowler, who has run the Hole In The Wall business for 30 years, has sold the shop to Stoke-on-Trent council. The council plans to demolish the site under a regeneration scheme that will erase much of the area's Victorian character. \"It's very sad. It's the last oatcake shop that serves out on to the pavement. The people who come here are not just customers, they're friends,\" Fowler, 61, said. More than 5,000 people signed a petition to save the shop after news of its potential demolition first materialised four years ago. \"The council should hang their sorry heads in shame,\" one person posted on the shop's online guestbook. \"Your oatcakes are head and shoulders above any others in Staffordshire.\" Another said: \"Progress is a good thing, it's such a pity that it is at the sake of our heritage and tradition.\" Fowler said: \"They've just knocked places down and there's no sign of anything being put up. A customer passed the comment: 'If Hitler had bombed this area, he couldn't have made a bigger mess.'\" The shop's closure at the end of this month has triggered questions about how to best redevelop Britain's industrial inner-city areas. Tristram Hunt, the local Labour MP and historian, said he was concerned that the regeneration of the area failed to recognise its historic importance. \"There's no doubt we've knocked down too much of the city's fabric,\" Hunt said. \"The threat is that we just end up with car parks and Tesco. This is still one of the great cities of the industrial revolution.\" Doug Wardle, of the City Centre Partnership, a body that focuses on the regeneration of Stoke-on-Trent, said he was concerned that too many of its old terraces were being knocked down. \"We feel that buildings of that nature \u2013 like the Hole In The Wall \u2013 should be retained to give the area some character,\" Wardle said. \"People travel miles to shop at it \u2013 it's a thriving business. We want more businesses like that, not less. The regeneration of the city is going ahead and I'm not opposed to it. But why do away with all the historical links?\" Prince Charles has even raised concerns about the demolition of terraced houses opposite the Middleport Pottery \u2013 which is now being transformed by his Prince's Regeneration Trust \u2013 to make way for gardens and parking spaces. The council has said the properties have been too neglected to save and there are concerns that many are built on old mine shafts and are blighted by subsidence. Councils like Stoke are struggling to find the cash to regenerate inner cities after the Pathfinder schemes established under the previous government to develop blighted areas were scrapped. But others are hopeful that the transformation of some of the most neglected parts of Stoke-on-Trent will become a boon for the Staffordshire conurbation, which comprises six towns, including Hanley. The development of the Emma Bridgewater factory is cited as a major success story, while several ceramics firms specialising in supplying the hotel trade are now taking on staff.",

      "bodyText": "Empire (BBC1) | iPlayer Melvyn Bragg on Class and Culture (BBC2) | iPlayer Proud and Prejudiced (C4) | 4OD Make Bradford British C4 | 4OD Upstairs Downstairs (BBC1) | iPlayer What has the British empire ever done for you? For the large majority of Britons, the answer is probably: not a great deal. When the empire was at its mightiest and Britain was an industrial and manufacturing powerhouse, most inhabitants of these islands lived in undernourished poverty, sharing in precious little of the spoils of imperial exploitation. For the average Briton, places like India were as remote as the moon, and only the tiniest fraction ever got to experience the splendour and luxury afforded to the colonial overlords. In this sense the imperialists were rather like investment bankers \u2013 when the going was good, they monopolised the profits, and when it all turned to custard, they turned suddenly egalitarian to spread the loss. If easy credit was the illusory benefit of the banking boom, then patriotic pride was the collective fantasy of the imperial boom. And just as the banking crisis nationalised banking debts, so did decolonisation nationalise imperial guilt. The result has been the widely propagated post-colonial narrative of shared British blame and shame. It has proved one of the great sleights of hand of 20th-century politics, in which an elite class of imperialists was artfully subsumed within a single penitent nation. Jeremy Paxman's much promoted TV series (with accompanying book) Empire did little to challenge this version of events. From the presenter's casual use of \"we\"s and \"our\"s, to the focus on majestic settings, the programme suggested an all-inclusive complicity in an epic adventure of enrichment, as though \"we\" were all in some sense participants or beneficiaries. In the advance publicity, Paxman said that his main reason for tackling the subject was to shed light on an \"unexamined part of our life\". But the idea that Britain's imperial history has been overlooked is not easy to sustain. What literate person, for example, doesn't know about the magnificence and brutality of the Raj, the subject of countless novels, films, TV dramas, and innumerable works of history, or of Britain's role as midwife in Israel's birth \u2013 as rehearsed once more last year in the major Channel 4 drama The Promise? Sure enough, the Raj and the Palestine Mandate dominated the first part of Empire. While the line of argument was surprisingly vague, the points of reference were deadeningly familiar. The spectacular view over Jodhpur, TE Lawrence in Bedouin robes, the blowing up of the King David hotel: if there are any aspects of these commonplaces that remain unexamined then Paxman never got round to examining them. Despite the definitive-sounding title, it was rather like a Blue Peter-style potted history glossed over with Paxo's sardonically engaging personality. \"The builders of empire were bold, they were adventurous,\" he proclaimed, almost parodying Chris Morris's The Day Today parody. \"Some were ruthless and some were just a bit unhinged.\" He rocked up in Kolkata and Cairo with his trademark inquisitive expression and that peculiar patrician air \u2013 at once diffident and superior \u2013 and conducted awkward conversations with the locals, like some well-meaning but only half-curious tourist. At a croquet club built by British occupiers in Cairo, he asked an Egyptian spectator: \"Were you glad to see the English go?\" \"For sure,\" replied the man, between puffs on his cigar. \"We weren't all bad, were we?\" Paxman probed, a little desperately. \"All kinds of imperialism are bad,\" the man explained. \"Was there nothing good that the British did here?\" Paxman persisted. \"Nothing was good,\" came the stony reply. \"All the time they were here, 70 years\u2026 did they do nothing good?\" Oh for God's sake man, give it up, he's not Michael Howard. \"I think not,\" said the Egyptian. In fact this little scene was unintentionally illuminating, and not just because the Egyptian was conspicuously enjoying one particular legacy of British rule \u2013 the rarefied sporting club. It was also noticeable how Paxman slipped about from \"we\" to \"they\" and \"English\" to \"British\", as though, when confronted with a native, his sense of national identity and personal culpability was put to the test. At such moments, was Paxman speaking as a member of Britain's privileged classes, a guilty liberal, or a representative of us, the viewers? These were questions that were actually worthy of further examination. \"Culture obliterated the need for class distinctions,\" enthused Melvyn Bragg on Class and Culture, talking about the 1960s. He meant culture in terms of the arts. But more recently culture, in terms of ethnicity, has obscured class commonalities. In the fallout from empire, social solidarity has been trumped by cultural difference. It's a trend that, as could be seen in Proud and Prejudiced, has reached a dangerous stage in Luton. The Channel 4 documentary followed two of the town's inhabitants, Tommy Robinson, leader of the English Defence League, and Sayful Islam, an activist with a series of banned extremist groups, who have taken up fanatical opposition in what might politely be termed the post-colonial discourse. The symbolic power of empire seemed here inversely proportional to first-hand experience of the thing. Both men were born long after the pink bits disappeared from the map of the world and yet each carried on as though their identities were forged in the blood of history rather than the security and relative comfort of Bedfordshire. Tommy Robinson came across as a chirpy, thuggish but not inarticulate voice of white working-class resentment (he insists the EDL is multiracial), and Sayful Islam as a pious, thuggish but not inarticulate voice of second-generation immigrant grievance (wearing the latest fashion of Islamic fundamentalism). The jingo and the jihadi, each was a projection of the other's worst fear of otherness, and it was hard to decide who was the most obnoxious. Hard but not impossible. In the end, with his celebration of 9/11, implacable homophobia, parasitical nihilism and totalitarian fantasies, and despite Robinson's nastiest drunken efforts, Sayful edged it. Bradford is another divided city that has struggled to resolve its post-imperial \u2013 and post-industrial \u2013 identity crisis. \"I don't think there is such a thing as multicultural Britain,\" said a \"diversity and community expert\" in Make Bradford British. \"It's as simple as that.\" Eight of the town's residents from a variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds were selected for an experiment in integration. There were some likable characters, like Rashid, a devout Muslim and former rugby league player, and a boorish ex-policeman whose idea of reaching out was to make jokes about \"Paki-bashing\" and \"black bastards\". Inevitably there were also tears. Whether real tears or reality TV tears, it was difficult to say. But there was something touching, if hopelessly contrived, about the proceedings. No one had a clue what being British meant to them but they all, in their different ways, craved membership of whatever entity it is that goes by that name. Perhaps a good entry point would be to recognise that the empire that brought them together has kept them apart.",

      "bodyText": "If all the media uproar about opera last week was to be believed, you could hardly venture forth into the auditorium without wearing a bullet-proof vest or declaring a taste for red-knicker satin, sluttish nymphettes and king-sized perverted cats, though not all at the same time or in the same place. Who would have predicted that two polar-opposite operas could have provoked such paradoxical responses? The controversy over John Adams's The Death of Klinghoffer, about the killing of an American Jewish passenger on the hijacked Achille Lauro cruise liner in 1985, was expected. Genuine anxiety hovered over the first night. Would those who condemn the work as pro-Palestinian and antisemitic, whose resistance had scuppered other performances over the years since its 1991 premiere in Brussels, allow ENO's new staging \u2013 a co-production with the Metropolitan Opera, New York \u2013 to go ahead peacefully? Protests seemed inevitable. Instead there was one man, one placard outside. The performance passed without incident and the mood was, if anything, curiously subdued. Two days later more extreme outrage \u2013 at least within the confines of a theatre performance \u2013 was provoked by Dvor\u00e1k's seemingly nice, watery fairytale opera Rusalka, concerning a doomed mermaid who falls in love with a man. The Royal Opera's new staging, first seen in Salzburg in 2008, was greeted by boos on account of its schlocky Euro-suburban bordello setting, all tacky laminate and frosted glass and pussies, and barely a water reed or a puddle in sight. Several people left. It's certainly hard to see how the ROH ever thought it might appeal to a UK audience, but trampling on good taste does not in itself render a production futile. A better link-up for the company might have been with the recent Bayerische Staatsoper, Munich staging \u2013 available on a 2010 DVD \u2013 which pushed the opera's horrors to its limits by portraying Vodnik the water goblin as Josef Fritzl, Rusalka as his cellar-incarcerated daughter. It manages to be both terrifying and visually stunning. At least the dazzling musical standards, under Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin making his house debut, were recognised. Camilla Nylund, after a cool start, warmed to the agony and sexual passion of the title role, heading a fine cast. Rusalka remains a troubling piece and Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito's production, though certainly not likable and never charming, embraced its bizarre, kitschy nature. The opera has its devotees, but each time I encounter it I feel more repelled by its cruelty, despite the rhapsodic glories of Dvor\u00e1k's score. Klinghoffer, meanwhile, was the event of the season and deserves all the space we can give it. The London premiere staging was a significant triumph for English National Opera, even if Tom Morris's production fell short of conveying the chilling clarity of the piece, captured in Penny Woolcock's 90-minute film version for Channel 4. At ENO the singing and playing, conducted by Baldur Br\u00f6nnimann, was formidable: Adams's score, often slow, elegiac, drawing on a tradition of Bach Passions rather than grand opera, is one of his best. Additions and subtractions have occurred since the work was new: the opening two choruses, of Palestinians and Jews, in the proximate but discrete keys of G minor and F minor, were originally separated by a scene of a Jewish family at home in New Jersey. Now, wedged together, the long, emotive outpouring of Palestinian exiles has yet greater prominence than the short, Jewish chorus, in which figures in orthodox garb plant trees. If you see the work as docudrama, you may object to the bias and anachronism, to the repetition of the line \"Israel laid all to waste\" by those waving a green Palestinian flag. If instead you regard it as historical fable \u2013 a means of trying to comprehend a criminal action \u2013 you are more likely to accept its rationale. All definitions of history circle around the blindingly obvious question of how to tell the truth. Alice Goodman's libretto, though clearly based on true events, makes no pretence at reportage. You may think it's the terrorists who get all the good tunes, yet the work's humanity is voiced chiefly through the compassionate words of Leon Klinghoffer himself: an ordinary family man trying to do good, care for those he loves and avoid trouble. The key scene on the bridge, in which the captain (Christopher Magiera) and his captor Mamoud (Richard Burkhard) share memories and laments, brings the action to a pause but no more than many other such moments in opera. Wagner is full of them. Morris (of War Horse fame), his designer Tom Pye and lighting designer Jean Kalman seem to struggle with this, rushing to amplify the story with film projection and a hinged, concrete wall suggestive of the West Bank barrier. You have little sense of the isolation of a ship on the high seas. The staging is often dark and indistinct despite brilliant moments: one was the choreographed depiction of the dead Klinghoffer and his wheelchair falling to the ocean bed as his ghostly double (movingly performed by Alan Opie) sings his \"Aria of the Falling Body\". A top ensemble cast deserves high praise, among them Michaela Martens as the dignified, distraught Mrs Klinghoffer, Kate Miller-Heidke's sharp, ditsy British dancing girl, Lucy Schaufer, Clare Presland and more. The orchestra was faithful to the dissonant riches of the score. After the shouting and politicking, the accusations that this opera should never have been written, that it might work better as an oratorio, I am glad to have seen it and to have witnessed John Adams cheered so generously. The writing of Klinghoffer was a mad imperative for its creators, as all works of art are, and the questions it raises grow no easier. Americans, especially post-9/11, will doubtless react more vociferously when this staging gets to New York, theoretically in 2014-15. Britain may consider itself less involved, yet its own role, forgotten or never known by most of us, goes back to the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which triggered a sequence of unimaginable and unintended sorrows. No composer or librettist or director or musician, no single audience member or critic can say anything new about an issue which has split two entire peoples for so long. If history, according to Voltaire, is filled with the sound of silken slippers going downstairs and wooden shoes coming up, John Adams's important yet elusive score gives us a coruscating sampling of each.",

      "bodyText": "Two interesting things happened last week and neither had anything to do with social networking or privacy. First, a web server fell over. Nothing new in that, you say; happens all the time. Yes, but this wasn't any old web server: it was the machine that hosts the Raspberry Pi site. It was overwhelmed because, on Wednesday at 6am, the project released its first product \u2013 a credit card-sized computer board that costs \u00a322 and which, when plugged into a TV and a keyboard, turns into a fully programmable computer running the Linux operating system. \"Guys \u2013 can you please stop hitting F5 on our website quite so often?\" pleaded the webmaster at one stage. \"You're bringing the server to its knees.\" The swamping of the site by people desperate for news indicated that something was up. The second thing that happened confirmed this hunch. The first batch of 10,000 units to be made available through major device resellers such as RS sold out within minutes of going on sale on Wednesday morning. This was the geeky equivalent of the Glastonbury ticket scrum. So something is indeed up. The Raspberry Pi project \u2013 a philanthropic effort to create the contemporary equivalent of the BBC Micro of yesteryear \u2013 has graduated from idealistic vapourware dreamed up in Cambridge to a finished, deliverable product manufactured in China. (In a nice touch, the Pi device comes in two flavours, Model A and Model B, just like the BBC machine, which was also designed in Cambridge.) Over the next few months, we'll see container-loads of the little computer boards delivered to these shores. The time has come, therefore, to start thinking about how this astonishing breakthrough can be exploited in our schools. Here are a few suggestions. First, we need to jettison some baggage from the past. In particular, we have to accept that ICT has become a toxic brand in the context of British secondary schools. However well-intentioned the thinking behind the ICT component of the national curriculum was, the sad fact is that it has become discredited and obsolete. As a result, educational thinking about the importance of computing and information technology in this country has been stunted for well over a decade. We've taken a technology that can provide \"power steering for the mind\" (as a noted metaphor puts it) and turned it into lesson for driving Microsoft Word. Second, we need to persuade Michael Gove and his colleagues that the subject that should be taught to all children is not ICT but something called computer science. The idea that there's a major body of knowledge in this field \u2013 complete with a stable and intellectually rigorous conceptual framework that is independent of today's or yesterday's gadgetry \u2013 is probably unfamiliar to residents of Whitehall, who think ICT is trivial because it's always becoming obsolete. Learning about computer science involves learning to program \u2013 to write computer code , because this is the means by which computational thinking is expressed. We wouldn't dream of teaching pupils about German culture without expecting them to speak German. The same holds for computer science. Third, those of us who are evangelists for this stuff need to recognise that the arguments in favour of it are not just the pragmatic or economic ones that have been advanced so far \u2013 for example the line that we need schools to teach computer science to halt the decline in undergraduates studying the subject, or that parts of the UK economy \u2013 eg the games industry \u2013 need skilled programmers (though it does). There are actually far more important reasons why our children should emerge from school with a deeper understanding of information technology and computational thinking than is the case at present. They are to do with citizenship and democracy. The world our children will inherit is one that will be shaped and controlled not just by physical realities, such as climate change, but by computer software. And the choice they will face is the one expressed in a recent, sobering book by Douglas Rushkoff, entitled Program or Be Programmed. \"Like the participants of media revolutions before our own,\" he writes, \"we have embraced the new technologies and literacies of our age without actually learning how they work and work on us. And so we, too, remain one step behind the capability actually being offered to us. Only an elite \u2013 sometimes a new elite, but an elite none the less \u2013 gains the ability to fully exploit the new medium on offer. The rest learn to be satisfied with gaining the ability offered by the last new medium.\" Is that what we want for our children? The answer has to be no, which is why we need to teach them computer science. Raspberry Pi offers us the chance to do just that. Will we have the courage \u2013 and the vision \u2013 to take it?",

It's a film shot over three years in the early 1970s by a film-maker (credited as co-writer, director and director of photography) fascinated by Hockney's portraits, made with the artist's partial and reluctant participation, and without any specific scenario or agenda. From the semi-improvised, unscripted material, Hazan carved a story tracing the disintegration of the affair between Hockney and his lover and model, the Californian Peter Schlesinger. Incorporated into this episode narrative are members of the flamboyant, charismatic, hard-working artist's circle, most notably Henry Geldzahler, Patrick Proctor, Celia Birtwell and Ossie Clark, the subjects of several key portraits. Hockney was initially horrified by the movie's intimacy, but was soon persuaded by his friends of its brilliance, and indeed it is an insightful portrait of the artist and his world, artfully organised and beautifully lit. Now nearly 40 years later, in this dual-format DVD and Blu-ray version, we can observe Hockney handling emotional and painterly problems at a key junction in his career and admire the way Hazan has captured the hedonistic gay culture of 1970s.",

      "bodyText": "\"What drove and kept me going over the decades? What was the motive force? If I had to use a single word, it would be curiosity.\" This quote from the pioneering photojournalist Eve Arnold, who died in January, aged 99, is among the various first-person wall texts that punctuate All About Eve, a retrospective of her work. Just how curious she was is evident in the timeline of the projects she undertook in her long career. It takes up one whole wall and makes for an illuminating read, not just because of the longevity of her career \u2013 from the late 1940s to the 90s \u2013 but for the range of subjects she tackled. In 1978 alone, for instance, she shot several portraits, including Dirk Bogarde, Francis Bacon and Irene Papas, alongside advertisements for Optrex, the English Tourist Board, Pentax and Rolex as well as assignments on the White Jews of Cochin, Indian troubadours and the London Symphony Orchestra for the Sunday Times magazine. Her work rate was relentless \u2013 she was still travelling on assignments well into her 70s \u2013 but as this potted history of her career shows the quality seldom wavered. All About Eve is essentially a celebration of Arnold's life and work, the photographs chosen by her close friends the curator Zelda Cheatle and the academic Brigitte Lardinois, who worked closely with Arnold at the Magnum Photos agency in the 1990s. It's a big, wide-ranging show selected from the vast archive of one anonymous private collector that includes many of Arnold's best-known photographs \u2013 a series each on Marilyn Monroe and Malcolm X \u2013 and several that are not so instantly recognisable. There are one or two surprises. The first is a beautiful self-portrait from 1948 which greets you at the entrance to the show. Here she looks young, chic and totally at ease before her own camera. As with many Eve Arnold photographs it comes with a story attached. Apparently she was accidentally locked into a friend's studio in Pennsylvania and, bored, began photographing herself to pass the time. The result is characteristically self-assured. The earliest pictures in the main gallery are her studies from 1951 of a group of black migrant labourers who journeyed north every year at harvest time to work on white-owned farms in Long Island. There are perhaps unconscious traces of the 30s work of Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange here, but Arnold's sombre and slightly surreal-looking group portrait of the farm owners, the Davis family, enjoying a picnic among the graves of their ancestors, is all her own. Throughout, you marvel once again at Arnold's ability to gain access to her subjects at work and at play. Her many portraits of celebrities, which she called \"personalities\", are the product of a more open and innocent era, when stars were not so paranoid about controlling their image. There's a beautifully intimate shot of the film director John Huston and his then teenage daughter Anjelica, sketching. Arnold caught a young Michael Caine cavorting playfully with Candice Bergen in a break from shooting The Magus in Majorca, and Marilyn Monroe lunching in the woods with her husband, Arthur Miller, on the set of The Misfits. There's a great shot of a young Andy Warhol deeply engrossed in a painting in the Factory in New York, and another of a luminous Mia Farrow in rehearsal. I've always been drawn more to Eve Arnold's in-depth reportage, the great commissions she did when she was very much a pioneering woman in a man's world. Again, her ability to be in the right place at the right time, and to catch it up close and personal, is almost uncanny. Her photograph of leaders of the American Nazi party attending a Black Muslim rally in 1961 \u2013 they were united in the belief that America should be racially segregated \u2013 has a chilling power 50 years later. A snatched black-and-white portrait, starkly titled Divorce in Moscow, USSR, 1966, is powerful in an altogether different way. In a drably functional room, a distraught man looks away from the camera to the right, while his wife stares stoically off in the opposite direction. The body language speaks volumes: his head rests on his hand; her hands are clasped tight, her wedding ring just visible. The physical space between the couple is minimal, but the emotional space is vast. In the background, oblivious, a man reads a newspaper, while another is engrossed in a book. Arnold catches the full weight of this fraught moment, and the universal truth that great personal suffering, as Auden put it, often \"takes place when someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along\". It's an extraordinarily poignant photograph: the decisive moment rendered just as powerfully, if not more so, as in a great piece of observational writing or film-making. Eve Arnold was a single-minded and determined documentary photographer, and a portraitist who won the trust of her famous subjects. Her travels took her to Afghanistan, Cuba, China and Mongolia, where she made a wonderfully evocative colour series of young women training to be horse riders in the national militia. Somehow it all came together in a visual style that amounts to a signature: nothing more or less than the world according to Eve Arnold.",

      "bodyText": "You wouldn't mistake an Etgar Keret short story for the work of anyone else. A typical piece will run to just a few pages, will be colloquial in style, and will juxtapose everyday life with some bizarre turn of events. In \"Unzipping\", from his new collection Suddenly, a Knock on the Door (his first for 10 years), a woman discovers, while her boyfriend is sleeping, a \"teensy zip\" under his tongue: \"When she pulled at it, her whole Tsiki opened up like an oyster and inside was Jurgen.\" In \"Pudding\", a man is dragged from his home by thugs, stripped, dressed in school uniform and then deposited at his parents' house, whereupon he finds he has regressed to his childhood. Keret's stories often read like bar-room anecdotes or surreal jokes that break off before their punchlines. They are at once sophisticated and anti-literary, extremely funny and slyly serious. While invariably set in contemporary Israel, and full of sex and violence, they also hark back to older storytelling traditions, such as the parable, the folk tale and the absurdist fictions of Gogol and Kafka. Keret, who was born in 1967 and grew up in Tel Aviv, is sometimes described as being at the forefront of a \"new\" kind of Israeli writing, one that eschews head-on engagement with politics. While the region's turmoil saturates his work, his stories convey no clear message or ideological position. Keret explains this by telling me that, as a writer, he feels more Jewish than Israeli. \"Most of the Jewish writer friends I have are American and I feel closer to them because they're always obsessed with one issue \u2013 identity: what does it mean to be an American Jew?\" Israelis, he says, rarely deal with the question of what it means to be Israeli. \"Maybe it's too difficult, but they tend to suppress it. There is something about Jewish writing that's very reflective, while Israeli writing is more active and epic in nature.\" Keret attributes his adherence to a Jewish outlook to the fact that he grew up with a \"dual identity\": a sense of being European as well as Israeli. \"I'm the son of Holocaust survivors. It was important for my parents to pass as Israeli-born Jews. But when I would go to sleep, my mum would recite Polish poems and they would listen to Wagner.\" In person, Keret is relaxed, charming and very funny. Spending time with him is like entering the world of his stories: suddenly, everything seems slightly off-kilter, full of comic potential. We meet at a private members' club, and before we sit down there's some kerfuffle over tables. \"People are so territorial here,\" he says. \"It's worse than the Middle East.\" Keret says that stories often begin for him with an observation: a scene on a street, a snatch of conversation. \"I don't think in terms of ideas. I have some sort of starting point. And I never know where the story is heading.\" He likens the process to driving: \"The first thing I have to do is press the gas pedal and take my hands off the wheel. If I crash, maybe I'll get to somewhere interesting. It can't be premeditated.\" One of the funniest stories in Keret's new collection is \"Actually, I've Had Some Phenomenal Hard-Ons Lately\", about a businessman who's having an affair with a colleague. The thing that satisfies the man most about this arrangement is that, when he takes his mistress for a \"candlelit dinner\", the cost is tax-deductible. Keret says the story was triggered by overhearing someone use the title phrase in a cafe. \"It struck me as such an amazing sentence. What's interesting is the word 'actually' and the word 'hard-on' used together. Because there's something about 'hard-on' that's so primal, so instinctive, while 'actually' is such a meta, linguistic kind of word.\" The resulting story was a kind of imaginative working out of this clash. \"The cheating is the 'hard-on' bit, while the tax is the 'actually',\" he explains. Suddenly, a Knock on the Door took a decade to write, partly because of Keret's increasing involvement with the world of film and partly due to writer's block. \"What happened was that my life changed a lot: I got married, I had a kid, a mortgage. I kept having ideas for stories, but they were about bachelors living in a dirty apartments, trying to get laid.\" It took time, he says, to find a way to write that was relevant to his new circumstances. Although Keret now makes light of this period of non-productivity (\"The funny thing was that no one gave a fuck\"), the title story of his new collection is eloquent testament to how difficult it must have been. It describes a writer being held hostage in his living room by a gunman, a pollster and a pizza delivery man, all clamouring for him to tell them a story. The writer can't think of any opening, other than: \"It began with a knock on the door.\" The story is vintage Keret, a parable about creativity that blends his travails with larger questions about the status of writers in Israel. Happily, it ends well: the writer finds a new way to begin.",

      "bodyText": "On the way to meet Gillian Wearing in her studio in Hackney, east London, I'm sitting on the top deck of the 55 bus, listening to the troubles of the young woman behind me, who is talking into the phone, unaware or uncaring who hears. It's a version of the drama you can tune in to most days on public transport, the intimacies of life and love turned casually outward. In this episode, the woman's man has left her and taken up with her friend, and she's been trying to sell a bag he gave her for Christmas on eBay. \"I'm not going to use it no more,\" she's telling another mate, and her fellow travellers, \"but I'm not just gonna give it away neither.\" The problem is, I've heard several times already, because it's Prada and she doesn't have the receipt her buying public thinks it's knock-off. The current bids are taking the piss, because at \u00a3400 it's still a bargain. She had a woman contact her asking for more details of the purchase but she can't get that off her bloke, since no way she's calling now he's with that slag. She said she would take the woman down to Selfridges and get them to verify it. By the time I reach my stop I would happily vouch for the bag's authenticity myself. There has been a lot written about the death of privacy in our hyper-connected world, but one certain casualty of our mediated lives is the sanctity of public space, the generational erosion of the idea that what you might want to tell your best mate you wouldn't necessarily expect strangers to want to hear. Twenty years ago, the bus journey would have been made without that voiceover. Twenty years ago, after Gillian Wearing graduated from Goldsmiths College, the year behind Damien Hirst, she was already quietly obsessed with that shift in propriety and candour and was among the first to anticipate and dramatise its implications. Wearing's studio is in a side street beside the Regent's Canal in east London. Her partner and fellow ageing Young British Artist Michael Landy, who famously destroyed all of his possessions in an Oxford Street shop in 2001, has a suitably minimalist space downstairs. She works above, in a white room strewn with artificial flowers she is arranging in a homage to Brueghel still lifes. Wearing is friendly, slightly awkward, looking inquisitively at me from beneath her trademark black fringe. When we sit down, on a pair of retro 70s chairs, I mention to her the bus conversation and wonder whether she thinks it is a good or bad thing that those public and private boundaries have been irretrievably blurred. On the whole, she likes the fact. \"I think media has changed us all,\" she says, referring to the shift from red telephone boxes to uninhibited mobile conversations, from passive TV to active camcorder and self-broadcast, from green-ink letters to webchat. \"It has all created a bigger democracy, I would say. More people have a voice.\" Wearing's first landmark work was quite a quaint exercise in exposing interior lives to the world. She approached people at random on London streets and asked them to write down on a piece of card what was on their minds. She then photographed them holding the signs. The images were surprisingly revealing, intentionally and not \u2013 the City worker with thinning hair who scrawled \"I'm desperate\", the black policeman who wrote \"Help\". They not only gave her subjects a voice, they gave viewers an instant snapshot of worlds of interiors. Some of Signs that say what you want them to say and not signs that say what someone else wants you to say will be included in Wearing's compelling retrospective, which opens at the Whitechapel Gallery at the end of the month. I wonder how she sees them herself, now? \"Well,\" she says, \"when I did them it was a million miles away from where we are now. In 1992, we were still being fed this line that British people are reserved and don't like to express what they are feeling. The idea of Signs is that if you approached anyone they would have something interesting to say. I never picked people. If they grasped the idea I was making art rather than a survey, then they tended to be intrigued.\" Subsequently, Wearing dreamed up many other situations in which people could reveal more or less of their private selves. On the Monday before we met, I'd been sitting in a screening room at the Whitechapel watching some of these films on a loop. For her Confess all on video. Don't worry you will be in disguise. Intrigued? Call Gillian\u2026 series, Wearing placed an ad in Time Out and invited people to come into a studio, put on a disguise and spill their guiltiest secrets. A 36-year-old virgin tells how watching his sister kiss his brother destroyed his life; a woman describes how she drugged and robbed the man who cheated on her; others in Neil Kinnock or George Bush masks own up to using prostitutes, or ghastly revenge on bosses. Her subsequent films play with different ideas of self-revelation; for 10-16, she taped adolescent boys and girls talking about their fantasies and fears and then had adult actors lip-synch them, as if the authentic voice of a child within. In 2 into 1, she put the breathtaking cruelty of twin boys talking about their mother into the mother's mouth and vice versa. In all the films, you have the voyeur's sense of too much knowledge, of uncomfortable privacies invaded. Over the years, Wearing seems to have been able to get all sorts of people to open up to her. Why does she think that might be? \"I don't think I have any particular thing,\" she says, quickly. \"I just found ideas that people relate to and they enjoy doing it. Facebook and Twitter are there for similar reasons, because people want to have their voices heard beyond friends and family.\" She doesn't keep in contact with any of her subjects, and though they have been invited to the shows in which they anonymously star, she is not sure how many have come. One or two have later expressed their gratitude, though, she says, \"for the opportunity to say things that they hadn't been able to express to other people before\". Wearing does not see her art as therapeutic, as such, or even particularly voyeuristic. It arises, she suggests, out of the \"sense that it is better to speak than to hold things back\". She has been strongly influenced by the sociology of Erving Goffman, author of The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, in which he details the ways that we have \"front-stage and backstage personalities, that we perform all the time, when we walk down the street, when we go into a shop. And when we are behind closed doors we go into a bit of a slump\". Not surprisingly, Wearing has been a devotee of reality television since pioneering 60s documentaries such as Michael Apted's Seven Up!, right through to the latest incarnation of Celebrity Big Brother, which, she believes, \"though it has become more about entertainment, still holds a mirror up, to a degree\". It would be fair to say, then, that Wearing likes the idea of what she calls people \"speaking freely in a lit room\". But the more I speak to her, it is hard to escape from the sense that, though quite practised, she finds that particular process quite unnatural herself. When she has been interviewed in the past, she has dwelt on her own inarticulacy. Now 48, she talks 10 to the dozen, but rarely in fully formed thoughts. Ideas come and go likably, but she is always quick to qualify and disown definitive statements about her own life. \"I suppose I was always a bit of a listener,\" she suggests, \"because I didn't speak a lot when I was younger. I couldn't string a sentence together, wasn't able to for some reason. I guess I was maybe drawn to people and language, how people express themselves.\" There is a journalistic impulse to all Wearing's work. She uses the apparatus of interview and documentary and, like all journalists, she seems drawn back to subjects that not only help her explain the world to her audience, but also offer a way for her to explain herself to herself. In one way, her career looks a lot like a series of brilliant strategies to communicate an inner life by proxy. She has always been the antithesis of her contemporary Tracey Emin, who is all about shocking revelation. Wearing seems rather at pains to disappear from her art, to let others do her talking. Partly, I wonder if this reticence has something to do with the place she fell to earth. I grew up at the same time as her in a different part of Birmingham, her home city. My mum taught very briefly at the school she attended, Dartmouth High, which experimented with large class sizes and which Wearing hated. In the 70s and 80s, Birmingham often felt a curiously alienated place, one that had lost its sense of identity, its industrial purpose. \"It was a sort of introverted city,\" she agrees, \"at least then, but I didn't leave it because of that; I left because I couldn't get a job there.\" Wearing had two hairdresser friends who wanted to come to London and, at 17, she came with them, living in bed and breakfasts in King's Cross. Having failed with hundreds of unsuccessful dear sir or madam job applications at home, in London she found secretarial and temping work easily. She was 21 before she even had a thought in her head about art. Until then, her only memorable creative act, she says, was the time when, aged 11 or 12, a teacher held up a mask she had made in front of the class and said it was good. But she dropped art in the third year of school and never thought about it until she got a clerical job at an animation studio in Soho's Golden Square. She was intrigued by the animators painting film cells, and when she wondered how they got to do it, they suggested art school. To her surprise, she was accepted to do a foundation course at Chelsea, on the basis of a few sketches she had done of her hairdresser friend, Kimberley (they drew at nights in the hostel they lived in, because there was no TV). From there, she went to Goldsmiths. On the first day, her tutor sat her class down and said that the reality was that none of them would ever be a practising working artist and to manage expectations accordingly. She was lucky enough to be in the Saatchi and Sensation generation that overturned that idea. Having been reluctant to adopt any particular public persona, Wearing suddenly found herself in the role of Young British Artist and then Turner prize winner in 1997. Most of her work foregrounded other lives; when she stepped into the frame, it was as an entirely elusive presence. Her great video, Dancing in Peckham, saw her bopping wildly in a shopping centre, to music only she could hear; her Homage to the woman with the bandaged face who I saw yesterday down Walworth Road, saw her mummifying her features, walking down the high street and filming people's reactions. The sense of Wearing being there and not there, of riddling objectivity, became a theme. In 2003, she began making the self-portraits that are the most haunting manifestation of her interest in masks and personae. She took her family photo album and painstakingly recreated some of its images using highly realistic wax mannequins, from within which her own eyes look out. She began with her grandmother, who had passed away, and went on to recreate portraits of her mother and father, her brother as a teenager, brushing his waist-length hair, her sister in a photo booth, and herself both at three years old and as a spirited-looking 17-year-old. The pictures have an obsessive-compulsive quality; each one took around four months to make. When I wonder what her family made of the strangeness of the project, she seems slightly surprised by the question, as if it hadn't occurred to her. \"They had to be measured [for the mannequins],\" she explains. \"So they knew all about it and I think they liked it. I had done my grandmother who was no longer around. So my mother was the first who was alive. She thought it was fine.\" But how unnerving was it to look at the world from within the facsimile bodies of her family? She can't or won't say: \"Well, you have technical things to concern yourself with,\" she suggests. \"It was such a long process. You are getting blouses made, bits and pieces sorted out. You are trying the mask on without the paint. You are spending a lot of time with it, doing lighting tests and so on, with the mask on a pedestal.\" The impulse itself, the motivation for making these things, she is reluctant to discuss. I wonder if she felt a loss of identity when she looked at the finished photographs. Was it herself or her mother she was looking at, for example? \"You always feel that you are the mask to some degree,\" she suggests. \"The photo of my mum I used was from before I was born, when she was 23. She was this quite innocent, optimistic young woman, I think. You are trying to get that across, somehow. I mean, my eyes are the only thing I have to use, but I try to make them as hopeful and young as possible,\" she says, with a laugh. Last year, Wearing made her first full-length film, a discomforting documentary focused on method acting, called Self Made. Once again, she placed an advert for non-actors, asking for people who \"wanted to play themselves or somebody else in a film\". After auditions, she filmed her half-dozen candidates exploring their deepest anxieties with the method coach Sam Rumbelow. They then role-played in turn their innermost trauma \u2013 the hatred they felt for an unloving parent; the scars of childhood bullying; the legacies of domestic violence. The resultant acted scenes, both real and not real, are almost too painful to watch. The film is edited with an emphasis on the loneliness of each of the actors, the way they are shut inside their heads, and the way the method allows some catharsis. Was Wearing tempted to put herself through the method process? She was, she says, \"but I knew Sam first so it got difficult\". I'm struck, I suggest, by the contradiction between her fascination with other people's interior lives and her apparent lack of interest in analysing her own. Does any part of her see Self Made, as well as her earlier work, as a strategy for self-understanding? \"Understanding me?\" she says. \"As opposed to understanding the people I am working with? I don't think so. I don't think it is about me. With the adverts I put out, it is clear I am not looking for anyone specifically. So I don't think necessarily I am looking for me, out there.\" But she seems so keen to remove herself from the story that you are curious about her own anxieties. When she looks back at herself as a girl, did she imagine she would one day have a family herself? \"When I played with dolls, I was always an auntie rather than a mum,\" she says. \"I remember my friend's brother when he was 13 saying, 'I am going to be a chemistry teacher.' I didn't have that kind of plan.\" Given that her work dwells so closely on the love-hate of family relationships, has it been a regret not having children, or a kind of Larkinesque relief? \"It was more if it was going to happen then it was going to happen,\" she says. \"It's not a regret because that is the way life is.\" Were any of those feelings present when, approaching 40, she reinhabited a mask of her own mother, at 23? \"No,\" she says, \"I didn't think that at all. It's more, when I first looked at the photograph of my mother I thought, 'That's my mother', straight away. But of course she wasn't my mother then. It's like you have certain expectations of what your family should do for you. But in that piece, I was trying to look at them as individuals. To see them in isolation.\" Wearing suggests her mother has always been \"loving and supportive\" of her and her work. She is more circumspect about her father, who she chose to recreate in a formal portrait in a dinner suit, as a young and handsome man. Brian Wearing died in 2005, not long after that photograph was taken. Was she as close to him as she was to her mother? \"Not as much, no.\" What did he do? \"He had a little shop where he sold televisions and radios.\" He was more distant? \"There was a little bit of separation between my parents, though they didn't divorce until many years later. But I didn't have the upbringing where I got to know him that well. No.\" Somewhere in that \"no\" I find myself rehashing some of the more painful unburdening of Wearing's subjects in Self Made. It's certainly where her method coach might begin his session. But perhaps, as she might suggest, I'm projecting. Before I leave, I ask why she has become interested in recreating Brueghel's flower paintings. \"I liked the fact that when he painted flowers,\" she says, \"he painted them all individually and then put them together. I called the first one People; it's like every one is unique, you know, they are not kind of a bunch.\" Some flowers reveal all of themselves at once and some hardly open up at all. But then, as Wearing seems instinctively to know, there are a hundred different ways to display your self to the world.",

Not surprisingly, Wearing&#xa0;has been&#xa0;a devotee of reality television since pioneering 60s documentaries such as Michael Apted's <em>Seven Up!</em>,&#xa0;right through to the latest incarnation of <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em>, which, she believes, \"though it has become more&#xa0;about entertainment, still holds a mirror up, to a degree\".</p> <p>It would be fair to say, then, that Wearing likes the idea of what she calls people \"speaking freely in a lit room\". But the more I speak to her, it is hard to escape from the sense that, though quite practised, she finds that particular process quite unnatural herself. When she has been interviewed in the past, she has dwelt on her own inarticulacy. Now 48, she talks 10 to the dozen, but rarely in fully formed thoughts. Ideas come and go likably, but she is always quick to qualify and disown definitive statements about her own life. \"I suppose I was always a bit of a listener,\" she suggests, \"because I didn't speak a lot when I was younger. I couldn't string a sentence together, wasn't able to for some reason. I guess I was maybe drawn to people and language, how people express themselves.\"</p> <p>There is a journalistic impulse to all Wearing's work. She uses the apparatus of interview and documentary and, like all journalists, she seems drawn back to subjects that not only help her explain the world to her audience, but also offer a way for her to explain herself to herself. In one way, her career looks a lot like a series of brilliant strategies to communicate an inner life by proxy. She has always been the antithesis of her contemporary Tracey Emin, who is all about shocking revelation. Wearing seems rather at pains to disappear from her art, to let others do her talking. Partly, I wonder if this reticence has something to do with the place she fell to earth.</p> <p>I grew up at the same time as her in a different part of Birmingham, her home city. My mum taught very briefly at the school she attended, Dartmouth High, which experimented with large class sizes and which Wearing hated. In the 70s and 80s, Birmingham often felt a curiously alienated place, one that had lost its sense of identity, its industrial purpose.</p> <p>\"It was a sort of introverted city,\" she agrees, \"at&#xa0;least then, but I didn't leave it because of that;&#xa0;I&#xa0;left because I couldn't get a job there.\" Wearing had two hairdresser friends who wanted&#xa0;to come&#xa0;to London and, at 17, she came with them, living in&#xa0;bed and breakfasts in King's Cross. Having failed with hundreds of unsuccessful dear&#xa0;sir or madam job applications at home, in London she found secretarial and temping work easily.</p> <p>She was 21 before she even had a thought in her&#xa0;head about art. Until then, her only memorable creative act, she says, was the time when, aged 11 or 12, a teacher held up a mask she had made in front of the class and said it was good. But&#xa0;she dropped art in the third year of school and never thought about it until she got a clerical job at an animation studio in Soho's Golden Square. She was intrigued by the animators painting film cells, and when she wondered how they got to do it, they suggested art school. To her surprise, she was accepted to do a foundation course at Chelsea, on the basis of a few sketches she had done of her hairdresser friend, Kimberley (they drew at nights in the hostel they lived in, because there was no TV).</p> <p>From there, she went to Goldsmiths. On the first day, her tutor sat her class down and said that the reality was that none of them would ever be a practising working artist and to manage expectations accordingly. She was lucky enough to be in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/10/charles-saatchi-british-art-yba\" title=\"\">Saatchi </a>and Sensation generation that overturned that idea. Having been reluctant to adopt any particular public persona, Wearing suddenly found herself in the role of Young British Artist and then <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1997/turner_prize/36273.stm\" title=\"\">Turner prize winner in 1997</a>. Most of her work foregrounded other lives; when she stepped into the frame, it was as an entirely elusive presence. Her great video, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jun/03/art\" title=\"\"><em>Dancing in Peckham</em></a>, saw her bopping wildly in a shopping centre, to music only she could hear; her <a href=\"http://bombmagazine.tumblr.com/post/5451679003/gillian-wearing-homage-to-the-woman-with-the\" title=\"\"><em>Homage to the woman with the bandaged face who I saw yesterday down Walworth Road</em></a>, saw her mummifying her features, walking down the high street and filming people's reactions.</p> <p>The sense of Wearing being there and not there, of riddling objectivity, became a theme. In 2003, she began making the self-portraits that are the most haunting manifestation of her interest in masks and personae. She took her family photo album and painstakingly recreated some of its images using highly realistic wax mannequins, from within which her own eyes look out. She began with her grandmother, who had passed away, and went on to recreate portraits of her mother and father, her brother as a teenager, brushing his waist-length hair, her sister in a photo booth, and herself both at three years old and as a spirited-looking 17-year-old. The pictures have an obsessive-compulsive quality; each one took around four months to make.</p> <p>When I wonder what her family made of the strangeness of the project, she seems slightly surprised by the question, as if it hadn't occurred to her. \"They had to be measured [for the mannequins],\" she explains. \"So they knew all about it and I think they liked it. I had done my grandmother who was no longer around. So my mother was the first who was alive. She thought it was fine.\"</p> <p>But how unnerving was it to look at the world from within the facsimile bodies of her family?</p> <p>She can't or won't say: \"Well, you have technical things to concern yourself with,\" she suggests. \"It was such a long process. You are getting blouses made, bits and pieces sorted out. You are trying the mask on without the paint. You are spending a lot of time with it, doing lighting tests and so on, with the mask on a pedestal.\"</p> <p>The impulse itself, the motivation for making these things, she is reluctant to discuss. I wonder if she felt a loss of identity when she looked at the finished photographs. Was it herself or her mother she was looking at, for example?</p> <p>\"You always feel that you are the mask to some degree,\" she suggests. \"The photo of my mum I used was from before I was born, when she was 23. She was this quite innocent, optimistic young woman, I think. You are trying to get that across, somehow. I mean, my eyes are the only thing I have to use, but I try to make them as hopeful and young as possible,\" she says, with a laugh.</p> <p>Last year, Wearing made her first full-length film, a discomforting documentary focused on method acting, called <a href=\"http://selfmade.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Self Made</em></a>. Once again, she placed an advert for non-actors, asking for people who \"wanted to play themselves or somebody else in a film\". After auditions, she filmed her half-dozen candidates exploring their deepest anxieties with the method coach Sam Rumbelow. They then role-played in turn their innermost trauma \u2013 the hatred they felt for an unloving parent; the scars of childhood bullying; the legacies of domestic violence. The resultant acted scenes, both real and not real, are almost too painful to watch. The film is edited with an emphasis on the loneliness of each of the actors, the way they are shut inside their heads, and the way the method allows some catharsis.</p> <p>Was Wearing tempted to put herself through the method process?</p> <p>She was, she says, \"but I knew Sam first so it got difficult\".</p> <p>I'm struck, I suggest, by the contradiction between her fascination with other people's interior lives and her apparent lack of interest in analysing her own. Does any part of her see <em>Self Made</em>, as well as her earlier work, as a strategy for self-understanding?</p> <p>\"Understanding me?\" she says. \"As opposed to understanding the people I am working with? I don't think so. I don't think it is about me. With the adverts I put out, it is clear I am not looking for anyone specifically. So I don't think necessarily I am looking for me, out there.\"</p> <p>But she seems so keen to remove herself from the story that you are curious about her own anxieties. When she looks back at herself as a girl, did she imagine she would one day have a family herself?</p> <p>\"When I played with dolls, I was always an auntie rather than a mum,\" she says. \"I remember my friend's brother when he was 13 saying, 'I am going to be a chemistry teacher.' I didn't have that kind of plan.\"</p> <p>Given that her work dwells so closely on the&#xa0;love-hate of family relationships, has it been&#xa0;a&#xa0;regret not having children, or a kind of Larkinesque relief?</p> <p>\"It was more if it was going to happen then it was going to happen,\" she says. \"It's not a regret because that is the way life is.\"</p> <p>Were any of those feelings present when, approaching 40, she reinhabited a mask of her own mother, at 23?</p> <p>\"No,\" she says, \"I didn't think that at all. It's more, when I first looked at the photograph of my mother I thought, 'That's my mother', straight away. But of course she wasn't my mother then. It's like you have certain expectations of what your family should do for you. But in that piece, I was trying to look at them as individuals. To see them in isolation.\"</p> <p>Wearing suggests her mother has always been \"loving and supportive\" of her and her work. She is more circumspect about her father, who she chose to recreate in a formal portrait in a dinner suit, as a young and handsome man. Brian Wearing died in 2005, not long after that photograph was taken. Was she as close to him as she was to her mother?</p> <p>\"Not as much, no.\"</p> <p>What did he do?</p> <p>\"He had a little shop where he sold televisions and radios.\"</p> <p>He was more distant?</p> <p>\"There was a little bit of separation between my parents, though they didn't divorce until many years later. But I didn't have the upbringing where I got to know him that well. No.\"</p> <p>Somewhere in that \"no\" I find myself rehashing some of the more painful unburdening of Wearing's subjects in <em>Self Made</em>. It's certainly where her method coach might begin his session. But perhaps, as she might suggest, I'm projecting. Before I leave, I ask why she has become interested in recreating Brueghel's flower paintings.</p> <p>\"I liked the fact that when he painted flowers,\" she says, \"he painted them all individually and then put them together. I called the first one <em>People</em>; it's like every one is unique, you know, they are not kind of a bunch.\" Some flowers reveal all of themselves at once and some hardly open up at all. But then, as Wearing seems instinctively to know, there are a hundred different ways to display your self to the world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Next Sunday the BBC's Burmese service will deliver the first broadcast from the new, greatly enlarged Broadcasting House. Soon after, the likes of Newsnight and Today will follow, as will all the corporation's global and national news, on TV, radio and online, together with such things as the commissioning and scheduling teams of BBCs 1, 2, 3 and 4. It's a very grand project, at 80,000 square metres the size of one and two-thirds Gherkins, and more than four times the original Broadcasting House. It will house 6,000 staff and its budget of more than \u00a31bn puts it above the Millennium Dome, and would buy two Olympic stadia, although the BBC says it will bring large offsetting savings. It is safe to say that, when the project was conceived over a decade ago, the corporation was more confident than it is now. The Hutton inquiry into the death of David Kelly had not yet forced the chairman and director general to leave, and it was not facing the 20% cuts which are following George Osborne's freezing of the licence fee. The finished building, ambitious in concept and compromised in execution, almost exactly reflects the shifting spirit of the corporation. Intended to last 30 years, it is being completed at a time when no one is very sure whether the BBC, or indeed television, will still exist that far into the future. The original Broadcasting House, completed in 1934, is a London landmark, a work of modernity tempered by classicism, and practicality by dignity, an expression of the civilised values of the corporation in its prime. Eric Gill carved its sculptures, and bright young designers created its interiors. The ghost of Lord Reith is ingrained in its walls, and no doubt flies about its pioneering ventilation systems, ready to be offended by real or imagined transgressions of his principles. When the decision was made to enlarge it, it was with acute awareness of this heritage. Luminaries like Alan Yentob got involved, an architectural competition was held and an architect was chosen, Richard MacCormac, whose design responded imaginatively both to its historic location and to the BBC's ideas of openness to the public. It teamed up with some experienced developers, Land Securities Trillium, to bring some professionalism to the business of getting it built, which seemed like a good idea at the time. These were decisions made a decade ago, and it seemed that the worst of which the BBC could then be accused was premature self-congratulation. It published a book called Building the BBC: A Return to Form, which with hindsight looks a little foolish. Costs rose from \u00a3991m to a stonking \u00a31.046bn, and a hoped-for completion date of 2008 became 2012. Some blame could be attached to something called Regent Street disease, a condition affecting stone-clad steel-framed buildings, which was discovered when refurbishing the old Broadcasting House, but not all. The National Audit Office would eventually criticise \"weak governance and poor change control processes\" and a failure to define sufficiently the scope of the project. Meanwhile something went wrong in the relationship between the developers and contractors and the architect, with the result that MacCormac's practice, MJP, left the project, complaining of \"insufferable contempt\". Another firm, Sheppard Robson, took over. Exactly what happened is shrouded in confidentiality agreements which mean that MJP does not answer any questions from the press, but the BBC now attributes the break-up to \"creative differences\". It is customary, when time and money go awry, to blame the architect, but the BBC makes it clear that his departure \"was not in any way a reflection on Sir Richard's professional capabilities\". It adds that, under the terms of the construction contract, the architect was employed by building contractor Bovis Lend Lease, and so his leaving was not exactly its responsibility. Having started off as a Medici-like patron, in other words, the BBC was now passing the buck to the builders. On the outside, the building deals gracefully with the liner-like bulge of old Broadcasting House and the colonnaded drum of Nash's church of All Souls, Langham Place. It recedes into a U-shaped court before advancing with a curve that answers those of its two illustrious neighbours. At the same time it forms a backdrop to the vista of the church from Regent Street and creates an interaction between public and corporation. The court that leads to the new front door is a genuinely open and welcoming space, and new pedestrian routes cross the site. MacCormac's detail can tend towards the fussy and the overworked, but in general it's a successful piece of urban place-making. So far it is mostly as MacCormac intended, but his ideas have been realised more sketchily inside. At the centre is a huge newsroom for 300 people which will be a three-dimensional location for BBC TV's news and weather. Four fat columns hold up the floors above, and two atria rise at either side. There is also a route, available to the public, which leads to the Radio Theatre and to a cafe, from where you can view the workings of the newsroom through glass walls. All this roughly follows the original plan. What is lacking is the connective tissue that would have joined it happily together. MacCormac's designs have been smoothed down and thinned out, such that a place envisaged as an arcade now feels like a corridor, and the relationships between newsroom, columns and atria are now more rudimentary. An over-reliance on plasterboard and bright colours makes it feel in places like a multiplex. The greatest loss is the arrangement of stairs and galleries that was planned above the entrance, made deliberately generous to encourage chance encounters among the people working in the building. Meanwhile the arts consultancy Modus Operandi, which was asked to assemble a set of artworks in the spirit of Reith, says that the external lighting scheme is not being looked after properly \u2013 in particular that a memorial to journalists killed in conflicts, by the artist Jaume Plensa and called Breathing, is not being switched on as often as it should be. It may be asked how much these changes matter. There will still be a big impressive newsroom for the cameras to swoop around, and glass walls for the public to peer through, and a way of getting to the Radio Theatre. The basic purpose, of centralising and achieving efficiencies, will be met. The BBC's surplus property, such as Bush House [see footnote] and Television Centre, can be disposed of, and savings made, with a benefit of \u00a3736m. The location in central London will help in getting important interviewees to visit. The Sheppard Robson office spaces will be perfectly decent and well-detailed, and the building as a whole is still much better than a typical commercial block. But there was a chance to make it more than this, and for a series of spaces to be made where the workings of the BBC and its relationships to the public would be made positively enjoyable, as opposed to being allowed to happen. There could have been a connected series of experiences, from the street through the court into the interior, but instead there is a disjointed journey through the creations of two different architects. It is one thing at the front, another thing inside, and it is only because of \"creative differences\" that it is like this. There is a further practice involved, HOK, who designed the interior fit-out. I may be wrong but I suspect that its work is as irritating to Sheppard Robson as Sheppard Robson's must be to MacCormac. It has an awful lot of red and orange, in order to match the brand colours of BBC news, including many lights the colour and shape of Halloween pumpkins, which I imagine will get a bit wearing after a while. HOK says it wants to achieve \"a celebration of people working together\", to achieve, in other words, something like the original intention of MacCormac's design, but its main devices are scaled-up coffee stations that intrude clunkily on the architecture. It doesn't seem to be quite up to the job. HOK also quotes Reith's statement that the BBC is an \"organism not an organisation\", which inspired them to provide some lights that pulse. These, apparently, \"give a heartbeat to the building\". The trouble is that, thanks to decisions made long ago, an organism is just what this building is not, and there is nothing that slowed-down disco effects can do to change that. \u2022 The following correction was published on 11 March 2012: A piece on the \u00a31bn extension to Broad-casting House said the BBC could make savings because \"surplus property, such as Bush House\u2026 can be disposed of\". It is not BBC-owned. The World Service rents it from property company Kato Kagaku. (\"Have I got a newsroom for you\", New Review).",

Some blame could be attached to something called Regent Street disease, a condition affecting stone-clad steel-framed buildings, which was discovered when refurbishing the old Broadcasting House, but not all. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/feb/25/bbc-spent-100m-more-broadcasting-house\" title=\"\">The National Audit Office would eventually criticise</a> \"weak governance and poor change control processes\" and a failure to define sufficiently the scope of the project.</p> <p>Meanwhile something went wrong in the relationship between the developers and contractors and the architect, with the result that <a href=\"http://www.mjparchitects.co.uk/\" title=\"\">MacCormac's practice, MJP,</a> left the project, complaining of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/23/bbc.television?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">\"insufferable contempt\"</a>. Another firm, <a href=\"http://www.sheppardrobson.com/\" title=\"\">Sheppard Robson</a>, took over. Exactly what happened is shrouded in confidentiality agreements which mean that MJP does not answer any questions from the press, but the BBC now attributes the break-up to \"creative differences\". It is customary, when time and money go awry, to blame the architect, but the BBC makes it clear that his departure \"was not in any way a reflection on Sir Richard's professional capabilities\". It adds that, under the terms of the construction contract, the architect was employed by building contractor Bovis Lend Lease, and so his leaving was not exactly its responsibility. Having started off as a Medici-like patron, in other words, the BBC was now passing the buck to the builders.</p> <p>On the outside, the building deals gracefully with the liner-like bulge of old Broadcasting House and the colonnaded drum of Nash's church of All Souls, Langham Place. It recedes into a U-shaped court before advancing&#xa0;with a curve that answers those of its two illustrious neighbours. At the same time it forms a backdrop to the vista of the church from Regent Street and creates an interaction between public and corporation. The court that leads to the new front door is a genuinely open and welcoming space, and new pedestrian routes cross the site. MacCormac's detail can tend towards the fussy and the overworked, but in general it's a successful piece of urban place-making.</p> <p>So far it is mostly as MacCormac intended, but his ideas have been realised more sketchily inside. At the centre is a huge newsroom for 300 people which will be a three-dimensional location for BBC TV's news and weather. Four fat columns hold up the floors above, and two atria rise at either side. There is also a route, available to the public, which leads to the Radio Theatre and to a cafe, from where you can view the workings of the newsroom through glass walls.</p> <p>All this roughly follows the original plan. What is lacking is the connective tissue that would have joined it happily together. MacCormac's designs have been smoothed down and thinned out, such that a place envisaged as an arcade now feels like a corridor, and the relationships between newsroom, columns and atria are now more rudimentary. An over-reliance on plasterboard and bright colours makes it feel in places like a multiplex. The greatest loss is the arrangement of stairs and galleries that was planned above the entrance, made deliberately generous to encourage chance encounters among the people working in the building. Meanwhile the arts consultancy Modus Operandi, which was asked to assemble a set of artworks in the spirit of Reith, says that the external lighting scheme is not being looked after properly \u2013 in particular that a memorial to journalists killed in conflicts, by the artist Jaume Plensa and called <em>Breathing</em>, is not being switched on as often as it should be.</p> <p>It may be asked how much these changes matter. There will still be a big impressive newsroom for the cameras to swoop around, and glass walls for the public to peer through, and a way of getting to the Radio Theatre. The basic purpose, of centralising and achieving efficiencies, will be met. The BBC's surplus property, such as Bush House [see footnote] and Television Centre, can be disposed of, and savings made, with a benefit of \u00a3736m. The location in central London will help in getting important interviewees to visit. The Sheppard Robson office spaces will be perfectly decent and well-detailed, and the building as a whole is still much better than a typical commercial block.</p> <p>But there was a chance to make it more than this, and for a series of spaces to be made where the workings of the BBC and its relationships to the public would be made positively enjoyable, as opposed to being allowed to happen. There could have been a connected series of experiences, from the street through the court into the interior, but instead there is a disjointed journey through the creations of two different architects. It is one thing at the front, another thing inside, and it is only because of \"creative differences\" that it is like this.</p> <p>There is a further practice involved, <a href=\"http://www.hok.com/\" title=\"\">HOK</a>, who designed the interior fit-out. I may be wrong but I suspect that its work is as irritating to Sheppard Robson as Sheppard Robson's must be to MacCormac. It has an awful lot of red and orange, in order to match the brand colours of BBC news, including many lights the colour and shape of Halloween pumpkins, which I imagine will get a bit wearing after a while. HOK says it wants to achieve \"a celebration of people working together\", to achieve, in other words, something like the original intention of MacCormac's design, but its main devices are scaled-up coffee stations that intrude clunkily on the architecture. It doesn't seem to be quite up to the job.</p> <p>HOK also quotes Reith's statement that the BBC is an \"organism not an organisation\", which inspired them to provide some lights that pulse. These, apparently, \"give a heartbeat to the building\". The trouble is that, thanks to decisions made long ago, an organism is just what this building is not, and there is nothing that slowed-down disco effects can do to change that.</p> <p>\u2022 The following correction was published on 11 March 2012:<br>A piece on the \u00a31bn extension to Broad-casting House said the BBC could make savings because \"surplus property, such as Bush House\u2026 can be disposed of\". It is not BBC-owned. The World Service rents it from property company Kato Kagaku. (\"Have I got a newsroom for you\", New Review).</p>",

      "bodyText": "A legend in his own lifetime: that was the charismatic Italian maverick Alighiero e Boetti (1940-94). The story of his life sounds quite improbable. A roving autodidact, steeped in alchemy and esoteric philosophy, he emerges out of nowhere as a youthful star of the 60s arte povera movement before rejecting its success and disappearing, just as suddenly, into the wilds of Afghanistan. It was said that he had gone to classify the world's longest rivers, to study maths or start a hotel in Kabul: all of which proved true in their way. But Boetti could not be pinned down. In his comparatively short life he sent back such a variety of work from so many different places \u2013 Ethiopia, Japan, Pakistan, Guatemala \u2013 that he was rumoured to be not one man but two: Alighiero and Boetti, just as his (self-adapted) name implies. Tate Modern conspires with the mystery in a sense. The catalogue biography gives nothing but the details of his birth and death. The curators do not try to corroborate the existence of his supposed 18th-century ancestor Sheikh Mansur, aka Boetti, leader of a Chechen uprising. They do not get into his drug habits or the tall stories of the One Hotel, except as an early instance of relational aesthetics. Their approach to Boetti is fastidious, reverent, scholarly. But what it doesn't fully entertain is the sheer joy of his art, its wayward and gorgeous appeal. The opening rooms, for instance, have a buoyancy that plucks them straight out of art history. Here is Boetti's absurdist Manifesto, matching the names of his arte povera comrades with tantalising combinations of coded symbols. All would be revealed by a notary for a price if only you could trace him (and art-worlders tried, to Boetti's delight). Here are his sweet Ping Pong signs spelling out the game on either side of an open door and his lightbulb that only shines for 11 seconds each year. Should optimists hang around in hope; have pessimists just missed it? To this day, people stop and stare as if waiting for enlightenment. These foolish things were all part of Boetti's first solo show in 1967, crammed with cardboard creations that now look practically classical in their elegance. Two years later, with Me Sunbathing in Turin 19 January 1969, he lays himself across the floor in handfuls of concrete reminiscent of vertebrae, as if frozen to the bone. There is no discernible face but a bright butterfly alights roughly where the buttonhole might be. The artist was famously dapper. Boetti's self-portraits are eccentric, witty, prolifically inventive. They sling mud at the whole idea of summing oneself up in a single work. He is both shaman and showman in a tarot-card print (teasing Joseph Beuys). A postcard shows two of him holding hands with himself so convincingly one might be looking at twins in identical suits. The id and the ego are lovingly united: but which is Alighiero and which Boetti? The elusive self-portraitist begins to slip away. In the late 60s there are still some exquisite works that show his hand: a chessboard woven out of tracing paper and steel (but how?); the exquisite pencil drawings in which the faintest fluctuations of line release all kinds of ghostly suggestions across humble sheets of graph paper. But he loved to collaborate, and gradually employed schoolchildren, students, pensioners and cafe locals across the globe. He relished the liberties they took with his projects, particularly the Afghans who embroidered his maps of the world with unexpected adjustments. Boetti is still best known for these maps, each country worked in the colours and symbols of its flag, each embroidery a year and more in the making, the passage of time apparent in the subtle mismatches of colour as the silks run out. The Afghans worked messages in Farsi along the borders and sometimes did the oceans in dazzling pink or black. Their own values were woven into the geopolitical picture, along with his: Sinai remains Arab even after Israeli annexation. A passion for the visual image is what distinguishes Boetti from the next conceptualist. While his contemporaries were shooting themselves in the arm or filling tin cans with their own excrement, he was producing objects of idiosyncratic beauty. You see that in the multicoloured embroideries based on mathematical progressions, in the Manifesto symbols that resemble some graceful cuneiform alphabet, and most especially in the stunning blue ballpoint pen works. These vast panels, each tiny grid minutely coloured in by different hands, shimmer like oceans or glow like blue skies, punctuated (literally) by white commas. Once again, these commas are coded and no doubt their secret meaning might enhance the experience. But to see them rising so vibrantly at Tate Modern \u2013 like birds or balloons \u2013 is to be reminded of what they signify: forward motion, not a full stop. Continuity is not what one might expect from this Zelig of an artist, always turning up somewhere else, a foreigner in every photograph. But it's one of this show's revelations. Tate Modern stresses his consistency of principle \u2013 order and disorder, logic and randomness, quasi-mystical number systems \u2013 and this is undeniable. But it is also as laborious as the display itself, where the floor weavings are laid out like a carpet department and there are far too many maps in one gallery for each to retain its special character. But the connections are there: in that glorious plane-crowded sky that looks stitched in silk and not scripted in Biro, in those little grids on paper and across the mesh of embroidery canvas, in the chessboards and friezes of hexagonal faces. Everything multiplies and everything is interwoven, the warp and weft of life come together no matter where you are. It may sound a spacey creed, blossoming out of Afghan poppies, but it produced sharp ideas and remarkable visions. Look closely at what might be Boetti's signature embroidery, a mass of radiant silks scintillating like static, and a celebratory pun gradually materialises before your eyes: \"I vedenti\" \u2013 the sighted.",

      "bodyText": "There are 8,000 deaths and 120,000 people injured on Argentinian roads every year. The statistics are worse, I'm told, in some other countries and insurance companies are being shaken down all round the world. But apparently in deeply corrupt and unjust Argentina a sizable industry has grown up to exploit these accidents, involving the victims, relatives of the dead and maimed, lawyers, the medical profession and the police. This is the background to the latest movie by Pablo Trapero, one of the leaders in the recent resurgence of Latin American cinema. The 40-year-old Trapero's movies have ranged socially and geographically across Argentina these past 10 years, finding pain and resilience in every corner of the nation. In the heart-warming road movie Familia rodante, an 84-year-old widow persuades a dozen members of her extended family to join her on a sentimental journey north from Buenos Aires to the Brazilian border to attend a wedding in a town she hasn't visited for 70 years. In Born and Bred, a successful interior designer goes south to austere, frozen Patagonia in search of self-mortification after being at the wheel in Buenos Aires when his wife and daughter were killed in a motor accident. In his most celebrated picture, Lion's Den, Trapero's wife, Martina Gusm\u00e1n, plays an innocent middle-class woman, pregnant by the lover she's alleged to have murdered, being incarcerated in a horrendous jail. Pain, corruption and ingrained inequity permeate his new movie, Carancho, in which Gusm\u00e1n again stars as well as being executive producer. She plays Luj\u00e1n, a youngish unmarried doctor from the provinces, working long hours at a rundown Buenos Aires hospital. She supplements her income by doing night shifts on an ambulance that specialises in picking up victims of the accidents that contribute to the horrendous statistics mentioned earlier. Before we encounter her, we're introduced to Sosa, a man in his early 40s who is beaten and kicked in the gutter by a group of thugs. They appear to be giving him some punishment or warning for having got on the wrong side of their employers. Sosa is played by Ricardo Dar\u00edn, who gave a riveting performance two years ago as a working-class cop turned investigative novelist in Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella's masterly The Secret in their Eyes, winner of the 2010 Oscar for best foreign language film. In a beautifully staged sequence, Sosa and Luj\u00e1n meet in the sodium-vapour lighting that illuminates the lurid night streets of Buenos Aires. As she gets him to help with her latest patient, she has trouble identifying his role. Is he, as his battered, bleeding face suggests, another victim? Or is he, as his professional confidence implies, some kind of official? Actually, Sosa is a shady lawyer who has lost his licence to practise and is working, quite literally, as an ambulance chaser for the \"Foundation\", a crooked organisation posing as a charitable concern with links to the cops and officialdom. It supposedly mediates between insurance companies and accident victims, but in fact takes most of the money. Sosa is a \"carancho\", the slang term for a \"vulture\", someone cynically exploiting the sad innocents and conspiring with the greedy not-so-innocents involved in accidents. This area is not unfamiliar to Hollywood. In Sidney Lumet's The Verdict (an excellent legal drama scripted by David Mamet), Paul Newman gave one of his finest performances as a sleazy, ambulance-chasing shyster in Boston. In knockabout comedy Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed, Bill Cosby, Harvey Keitel and Raquel Welch were competing private ambulance drivers, while in more sombre mood Nicolas Cage played a New York ambulance driver at the end of his tether in Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead. It gradually becomes apparent, however, that Trapero's film is a noir thriller of a gritty, downbeat kind centring on a doomed love affair and using the system of exploiting insurance compensation as a metaphor for a corrupt, uncaring society. Two groups of montages establish the leading characters' situations. Sosa uses his legal wiles to lure a succession of vulnerable people into his web, persuading them that a painful \"accident\" should be converted into a profitable \"incident\". Luj\u00e1n, on the other hand, is drawn into the world of the badly injured patients she's trying to help and heal. Both are damaged in the process and attracted to each other in delicately handled off-duty scenes. Like Paul Newman's lawyer in The Verdict, Sosa seeks redemption by helping his clients, though things go wrong in a succession of unanticipated ways as he attempts to escape the slimy tentacles of the ruthless Foundation. Always there is that one last big job that will release him into freedom. Luj\u00e1n, on the other hand, needs moral and emotional support to sustain her through the trials of an impossibly demanding occupation and to save her from despair. Punishment of a physical and mental kind is never far away in a Trapero movie. As it's unavoidable, the test is whether you can find the stoicism and grace to confront and overcome it. His film is claustrophobic, largely set at night and in life's darker corners, and the atmosphere is as thick and rancid as something ejected by a garbage impactor. The film's plotting is at times ragged and muffled, though this might be intentional, a way of suggesting the endless ramifications of the endemic corruption. The performances, however, have depth and resonance.",

But apparently in deeply corrupt and unjust Argentina a sizable industry has grown up to exploit these accidents, involving the victims, relatives of the dead and maimed, lawyers, the medical profession and the police. This is the background to the latest movie by Pablo Trapero, one of the leaders in the recent resurgence of Latin American cinema.</p> <p>The 40-year-old Trapero's movies have ranged socially and geographically across Argentina these past 10 years, finding&#xa0;pain and resilience in every corner of the nation. In the heart-warming road movie <em>Familia rodante</em>, an 84-year-old widow persuades a dozen members of her extended family to join her on a sentimental journey north from Buenos Aires to the Brazilian border to attend a wedding in a town she hasn't visited for 70 years. In <em>Born and Bred</em>, a successful interior designer goes south to austere, frozen Patagonia in search of self-mortification after being at the wheel in Buenos Aires when his wife and daughter were killed in a motor accident. In his most celebrated picture, <em>Lion's Den</em>, Trapero's wife, Martina Gusm\u00e1n, plays an innocent middle-class woman, pregnant by the lover she's alleged to have murdered, being incarcerated in a horrendous jail.</p> <p>Pain, corruption and ingrained inequity permeate his new movie, <em>Carancho</em>, in which Gusm\u00e1n again stars as well as being executive producer. She plays Luj\u00e1n, a youngish unmarried&#xa0;doctor from the provinces, working long hours at a rundown Buenos Aires hospital. She supplements her income by doing night shifts on an ambulance that specialises in picking up victims of the accidents that contribute to the horrendous statistics mentioned earlier. Before we encounter her, we're introduced to Sosa, a man in his early 40s who is beaten and kicked in the gutter by a group of thugs. They appear to be giving him some punishment or warning for having got on the wrong side of their employers. Sosa is played by Ricardo Dar\u00edn, who gave a riveting performance two years ago as a working-class cop turned investigative novelist in Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella's masterly <em>The Secret in their Eyes</em>, winner of the 2010 Oscar for best foreign language film.</p> <p>In a beautifully staged sequence, Sosa and Luj\u00e1n meet in the sodium-vapour lighting that illuminates the lurid night streets of Buenos Aires. As she gets him to help with her latest patient, she has trouble identifying his role. Is he, as his battered, bleeding face suggests, another victim? Or is he, as his professional confidence implies, some kind of official?</p> <p>Actually, Sosa is a shady lawyer who has lost his licence to practise and is working, quite literally, as an ambulance chaser for the \"Foundation\", a crooked organisation posing as a charitable concern with links to the cops and officialdom. It supposedly mediates between insurance companies and accident victims, but in fact takes most of the money. Sosa is a \"carancho\", the slang term for a \"vulture\", someone cynically exploiting the sad innocents and conspiring with the greedy not-so-innocents involved in accidents. This area is not unfamiliar to Hollywood. In Sidney Lumet's <em>The Verdict</em> (an excellent legal drama scripted by David Mamet), Paul Newman gave one of his finest performances as a sleazy, ambulance-chasing shyster in Boston. In knockabout comedy <em>Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed</em>, Bill Cosby, Harvey Keitel and Raquel Welch were competing private ambulance drivers, while in more sombre mood Nicolas Cage played a New York ambulance driver at the end of his tether in Scorsese's <em>Bringing Out the Dead</em>. It gradually becomes apparent, however, that Trapero's film is a noir thriller of a gritty, downbeat kind centring on a doomed love affair and using the system of exploiting insurance compensation as a metaphor for a corrupt, uncaring society.</p> <p>Two groups of montages establish the leading characters' situations. Sosa uses his legal wiles to lure a succession of vulnerable people into his web, persuading them that a painful \"accident\" should be converted into a profitable \"incident\". Luj\u00e1n, on the other hand, is drawn into the world of the badly injured patients she's trying to help and heal. Both are damaged in the process and attracted to each other in delicately handled off-duty scenes. Like Paul Newman's lawyer in <em>The Verdict</em>, Sosa seeks redemption by helping his clients, though things go wrong in a succession of unanticipated ways as he attempts to escape the slimy tentacles of the ruthless Foundation. Always there is that one last big job that will release him into freedom. Luj\u00e1n, on the other hand, needs moral and emotional support to sustain her through the trials of an impossibly demanding occupation and to save her from despair.</p> <p>Punishment of a physical and mental kind is never far away in a Trapero movie. As it's unavoidable, the test is whether you can find the stoicism and grace to confront and overcome it. His film is claustrophobic, largely set at night and in life's darker corners, and the atmosphere is as thick and rancid as something ejected by a garbage impactor. The film's plotting is at times&#xa0;ragged and muffled, though this might be intentional, a way of suggesting the endless ramifications of the endemic corruption. The performances, however, have depth and resonance.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the most likable things about the prolific Steven Soderbergh is just how eager he is to embrace (and subvert) the traditions of genre cinema. While other Cannes-favourite \"auteur\" directors may claim flatulently that their work is too personal for conventional labels (ha!), Soderbergh flits nimbly from big-budget crime caper to hand-held docudrama (the Oceans franchise, Full Frontal), from head-cracking action to arty angst (sex, lies, and videotape), from conspiracy thriller to political biopic (Michael Clayton, Che) and from sci-fi to sexpos\u00e9 (Solaris, The Girlfriend Experience) with ease. His current cinema release, Haywire, casts mixed martial arts star Gina Carano as a high-kicking secret agent, lending a big-screen sheen to the straight-to-video genre of which Cynthia Rothrock was once queen bee. Meanwhile his viral outbreak movie Contagion (2011, Warner, 12) hits the DVD shelves, taking its lead from such time-honoured disaster epics as Earthquake, The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno, in which a galaxy of stars would struggle to outlive one another as the world around them crumbled, sank or exploded. Starting with a cough on \"Day 2\" of a nascent pandemic in the making, Contagion follows a path of sickly kisses, germy handshakes and amorphous airborne spittle that will help turn Gwyneth Paltrow's snivelly domestic cold into an unfolding global nightmare. Tinged with a sickly green-yellow hue that seems to infect every frame (even the Warners logo looks decidedly off-colour), the camera darts from door handles to footsteps to light switches to discarded tissues as the virus skips from patient to patient, merrily wiping out its quarry with rewarding disregard for their box-office clout. While everyone from Cecil B DeMille to Irwin Allen made sure that the biggest box-office hitters always lived longest, Soderbergh revels in treating his A-list stars (Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Elliott Gould, Marion Cotillard et al) as flies to wanton gods, dispatching them at random, lending an excitingly unpredictable air to the fast-moving proceedings. On a narrative level this comes on like an appropriately accelerated cross between Roger Spottiswoode's super-serious TV movie And the Band Played On and Wolfgang Petersen's ridiculous rogue monkey thriller Outbreak, with a healthy dose of pot-boiling double-crossing thrown in for good measure. Jude Law gets a particularly fine crack of the whip as a snaggle-toothed blogger peddling ill-informed mischief whose self-righteous, self-serving character spurs screenwriter Scott Z Burns to observe hilariously: \"Blogging isn't writing \u2013 it's just graffiti with punctuation!\" (When I first saw Contagion at a press screening, that line almost got a standing ovation.) Behind it all lurks the unmistakable ghost of George Romero's The Crazies, which brilliantly combined the undead horrors of the supernatural zombie flick with the creeping paranoia of a political thriller, to deeply unsettling effect. Only an ever-so-slightly trite closing/opening stanza undercuts the sense of growing malaise, providing an unnecessary punchline to an otherwise extremely effective shaggy-dog story that will have you flinching every time you hear someone sniff. It's not hard to trace the infectious roots of the pustulent cinematic boil that is Immortals (2011, Universal, 15), a ghastly cross-pollinated catastrophe spawned in the cultural Petri dish of Zack Snyder's 300 and Louis Leterrier's Clash of the Titans. Centring around Hyperion's attempts to reclaim the lost bow of Epirus and free the Titans entombed within Mount Tartarus (blah blah blah), this boring, quasi-classical balderdash has a target audience of no one at all; too infantile to be taken seriously by grown-ups, and too stupidly violent to be classified for kids (at least here in the UK). After making a name for himself with the comparatively sprightly mid-priced hit The Cell, director Tarsem Singh Dhandwar comes a cropper with this lumbering $75m turkey, slathering the screen with drearily spectacular scenery upon which the entire cast would be chewing were it not for the fact that it's all so demonstrably digital. Mickey Rourke is particularly rubbish, overturning the comeback triumphs of The Wrestler to remind us all of the kind of lame-brained, cynical, production-line crap that made everyone give up on him in the first place. Hell, next to this, Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man looks like fun! The combination of Withnail &amp; I creator Bruce Robinson and gonzo author Hunter S Thompson sounds like a marriage made in heaven. Like Thompson, Robinson has always been an outsider who refused to sell his soul to the devil; after a bruising experience directing the 90s psycho-thriller Jennifer 8 he turned his back on the compromises of Hollywood, spurning direction entirely until called out of retirement by Johnny Depp to work on The Rum Diary. Working from a long-unpublished manuscript inspired by Thompson's early years as a jobbing journo, this celebratory adaptation of a lesser text is decidedly uneven fare. To his credit, Robinson gets the tone of Thompson's misanthropic world-view down pat, despite using very little of the author's dialogue. Depp is good, too, having previously perfected his Hunter impersonation in Terry Gilliam's underrated Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Yet what's lacking is the anarchic spark that this cocktail of incendiary elements should rightly ignite, leaving the viewer with the sense that all this debauchery is merely a preamble to more exciting adventures elsewhere. Where's Uncle Monty when you really need him to stir things up?",

Travel clinic: accessible holidays The dilemma We celebrate our golden wedding in September and would like to spend a few days in an interesting European city. My husband is in a wheelchair. Any ideas? Judy If you were to choose a destination based on accessibility, Berlin would come out tops. It was rebuilt after the Second World War; its modern city centre, U-Bahn system and attractions such as the Reichstag and Checkpoint Charlie are wheelchair-friendly, and there are plenty of resources to help with trip planning (see tinyurl.com/6vpmqum). However, for a celebratory weekend, Barcelona's mix of sunshine, food and culture might have the edge. Most of the city centre, including Las Ramblas and the marina, is flat and you can get to most sites on the wheelchair-adapted Barcelona Bus Tur\u00edstic. Mike Davis of Disabled Access Holidays (disabledaccessholidays.com) recommends the harbour-front Duquesa de Cardona hotel, which has wheelchair-adapted rooms. A three-night package costs about \u00a3900 for two, including hotel, flights and taxi transfers. They can also arrange local mobility-scooter hire. For details go to barcelona-access.com.

Later on we trudge through the snow to one of the local restaurants; our choices are limited since my ex brother-in-law's children are very picky about their food: one is vegetarian but hates vegetables; the other only likes pizza. Mine, who will happily eat anything, find this menu myopia as painful as I do. Eventually, food ordered, the children giggle together at one end of the table, while the three male adults sit at the other. It's a slightly odd dynamic: a close-knit father and son and then me, the outsider; the man who married into their family and then, six years later, changed his mind \u2013 not just about who he wanted to sleep with, but which sex he wanted to sleep with.

So you might as well join me for a whisky.\" He pours me a drink from the honesty bar. \"So what's happening in your world?\" he asks.</p> <p>\"Well, I'm seeing this really fit guy called Simon,\" I tell him. Except, of course, I don't say that. Instead, we talk football and finance.</p> <p>Later on we trudge through the snow to one of the local restaurants; our choices are limited since my ex brother-in-law's children are very picky about their food: one is vegetarian but hates vegetables; the other only likes pizza. Mine, who will happily eat anything, find this menu myopia as painful as I&#xa0;do.</p> <p>Eventually, food ordered, the children giggle together at one end of the table, while the three male adults sit at the other. It's a&#xa0;slightly odd dynamic: a close-knit father and son and then me, the outsider; the man who married into their family and then, six years&#xa0;later, changed his mind \u2013 not&#xa0;just about who he wanted to sleep with,&#xa0;but which sex he wanted to sleep with.&#xa0;A&#xa0;subject we all, despite&#xa0;three&#xa0;of these annual ski trips, have always been too polite, or ill at ease, to mention.

It can be a month of contrasts, too, with wind and frost set to challenge the first of spring growth. Knuckle down and complete winter work to make way for the tasks that are targeted at the growing season. Crops and robbers Order your seed potatoes as they will need time to chit before planting out. Leave them in a cool, bright room to promote the eyes. Earlies can be planted later in the month and kept covered with fleece to prevent early shoots from frost damage. Choose your sunniest position for onions and shallots as they like the heat and free drainage, and wait until the second half of the month to plant. Do not plant in freshly manured ground as they prefer soil that was improved for a previous crop. Line out in rows that are easy to weed and use a dibber to insert the sets so that their necks are just below the soil. Birds love to pull them free at this stage so net until the roots have a hold. Pruning Complete the pruning of wisteria, summer-flowering clematis and late-flowering shrubs such as buddleia and Russian sage. The sap is rising and you will be cutting away important energy if this is left too late. Hold off from pruning evergreens until April as they need their foliage to kickstart growth in warmer weather. Remove up to a third of spent flowering stems back to old wood on winter-flowering shrubs, such as forsythia and jasmine, as soon as the flowers fade. This will promote fresh new wood for next year. Slug it out Beware the slugs when new growth is susceptible, and use pellets judiciously and only where necessary. Always use an organic pellet, such as ferric phosphate (harrodhorticultural.com), as they pose no risk to animals and insects. Better still, think about alternative slug-control regimes, such as growing hostas in pots or choosing the blue-leaved forms that are less susceptible. Clean sweep Cut back the remains of last year's perennials and institute a thorough spring clean in the beds. There is no better time than now to winkle out weeds. Follow up with a protective mulch to keep seedlings at bay, but remember that perennial weeds will only do better for it: never turn a blind eye to couch, ground elder, nettle and creeping buttercup. Make my dahlia If you have overwintered dahlias inside, check that the tubers are hydrated and manure the ground that will take them next month. If the tubers are tired, pot up and start off in a glasshouse or frame with the aim of propagating from the first new growth. Cuttings are incredibly easy if taken when the shoots are just a few inches long, and with warmth they will be rooted and ready to plant out when the ground is frost-free. Re-pot pelargoniums and fuchsias that were overwintered and gently up the watering to promote new shoots. Pot up begonias and lilies, and summer-flowering bulbs such as gladiolus. Lawn order The grass has barely stopped growing this winter so set the mower high and cut on a dry day. The smell of the first cut grass is like nothing else. Paths mown into meadows or a neat frame to a rough area will go a long way to provide the contrast that keeps a wilder garden feeling tended. Although now is a good time to start laying turf, prepare ground for sowing lawn seed and hold off until early April to get best results. Sowing seeds As soon as the soil reaches 6C you can start to sow directly outside. Sweet peas and broad beans can be sown first, and though the first of the salad can go in now you get better results if you warm the ground first with plastic or cloches. Early sowings of mustard, rocket and cut-and-come-again salad are some of the most delicious mouthfuls of the year, so seize the moment if it looks like the weather is with us and the month is kind.",

Each year millions of tonnes of steel, reinforced concrete, copper, brass, plastic and thousands of tonnes of embalming fluid containing formaldehyde are used to cope with 60 million-plus deaths. We use arable land to bury the dead and cut down trees (50m per year in India) for pyres. In the UK 70% of bodies are cremated \u2013 each requires around 20 litres of fuel. About 16% of total UK mercury emissions come from crematoria \u2013 this must be reduced to zero by the end of the decade.

Good on you for seeking out an alternative means of dispatch.

However, there is plenty of innovation about which promises to revolutionise burial. Resomation (resomation.com), a winner of our Big Idea Ethical Award in 2010, is a technique patented by Scottish entrepreneur Sandy Sullivan in which the body is reduced to its basic elements in a water and alkali method.

      "bodyText": "New Yorker Jonathan Lethem, 48, found success with the novels Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude. His latest book is a collection of essays, The Ecstasy of Influence. In the preface to your new collection, you write of how, before starting an essay, you first need to \"invent a character\" to do the writing. Where does this unease with non-fiction come from? I came to writing from a really particular angle. I grew up in a visual arts household \u2013 my dad was a painter \u2013 and I thought that was what I was going to do. At the same time, I loved stories and reading. By the time I was making the switch to stories, all of my way of thinking about art-making was from the plastic arts. I thought of stories and novels as these invented, conjured objects. None of it was about the personal, confessional, diary-keeping impulse, nor about the scholarly idea of writing about things to be accurate. It was about making up stuff. I'd written three novels and several dozen short stories before anyone talked me into a book review. The title piece of the book, an essay defending artistic borrowing, or plagiarism, which was itself entirely plagiarised, struck a massive chord when it was published five years ago. Did the reaction surprise you? I was gratified; I guess it helped me know that I was right to think it needed doing. One of the things about that piece is that it's so unoriginal. All these thoughts were broadly available before I wrote it. But I was looking at a landscape in which all the advocates for the idea of appropriation were either lawyers such as Lawrence Lessig, or they were outlaws, web artists, radical provocateurs. I wanted to talk about it from the perspective of someone making their living by copyright, creating more or less traditional narrative artworks that subsume influence rather than wearing it on their sleeve. One of the pieces in the book is about the unhappy experience of being reviewed by James Wood. What was your beef with him? That piece is not a comprehensive critique of Wood. It's really a memoir about what it's like to be reviewed by someone who everyone told me had awesome and comprehensive powers. Certainly the manner of his presentation \u2013 even putting out a book called How Fiction Works \u2013 has this implication. I had a glancing encounter with his notion of authority and it irked me. But I was really writing about my own confusion. Much of your writing suggests an ambivalence about the internet. You see it as a democratising force but also something darker? There's a real push and pull. The web exposes tensions that already exist: between egalitarian impulses and elitist yearnings for authority and control. It makes them very naked. Which can be useful, but also quite raw and uncomfortable \u2013 to have normally smoothed-over anxieties brought into such violent visibility as they are, for example, by internet comments sections. A lot of your writing about culture concerns physical artefacts - record sleeves, books, comics. Isn't this aspect of cultural appreciation lost online? Maybe. But you see the most amazing acts of curation and resurrection on the internet. It is a spectacular Borgesian library, and at the same time it represents a flattening of a tangible or a hierarchical life. I had to decide what record to own. Now I just own them all. It's very complicated. What's most excited you recently? My own sensors are in a disadvantaged state because I'm the parent of two very young boys and at the same time I've taken this big teaching job [as Disney professor of creative writing at Pomona College, California]. My ability to attend to stuff is very retarded in two ways: I'm constantly trying to figure out what to talk to my students about; and at the same time I'm reading a lot of Dr Seuss and getting up at three in the morning. The first thing to go is my own optional appetites. The only previous occupant of the Disney chair was David Foster Wallace. Ironic that two such anti-corporate writers should be given the post. Yes, they'll probably have to go for Slavoj Zi\u017eek next!",

The web exposes tensions that already exist: between egalitarian impulses and elitist yearnings for authority and control. It makes them very naked. Which can be useful, but also quite raw and uncomfortable \u2013 to have normally smoothed-over anxieties brought into such violent visibility as they are, for example, by internet comments sections.</p> <p><strong>A lot of your writing about culture concerns physical artefacts - record sleeves, books, comics. Isn't this aspect of cultural appreciation lost online? </strong></p> <p>Maybe. But you see the most amazing acts of curation and resurrection on the internet. It is a spectacular Borgesian library, and at the same time it represents a flattening of a tangible or a hierarchical life. I had to decide what record to own. Now I just own them all. It's very complicated.</p> <p><strong>What's most excited you recently?</strong></p> <p>My own sensors are in a disadvantaged state because I'm the parent of two very young boys and at the same time I've taken this big teaching job [as Disney professor of creative writing at Pomona College, California]. My ability to attend to stuff is very retarded in two ways: I'm constantly trying to figure out what to talk to my students about; and at the same time I'm reading a lot of Dr Seuss and getting up at three in the morning.</p> <p>The first thing to go is my own optional appetites.</p> <p><strong>The only previous occupant of the Disney chair was David Foster Wallace. Ironic that two such anti-corporate writers should be given the post.</strong></p> <p>Yes, they'll probably have to go for Slavoj Zi\u017eek next!</p>",

      "bodyText": "The truth is, anyone coming to a place this beautiful to ski should happily eat a spag bol and thank their lucky stars. Yet Alta Badia, in the heart of the Dolomites, attracts the kind of clientele that likes its lilies gilded. This is one of the ritziest Italian winter resorts, so while it has some of the most expansive ski areas in the world, in the middle of a Unesco natural world heritage site, the locals are eager for visitors to know they do pretty good food, too. Arriving here via the flight to Verona is a red herring. After an hour at continental speeds on the autostrada towards the northernmost province of South Tyrol, Roman amphitheatres and Capulet balconies feel impossibly distant from the apple orchards that pave the way to the Alpine slopes. Another hour or so later and you are in Alta Badia, as Italian as sauerkraut and strudel. The legacy of the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire and the troubled decades that followed is a region that still feels more Germanic than part of the Italian state, with a wealth to match that might explain the preponderance of Michelin-starred chefs, three even in the Alta Badia ski resort: a trio billed as the Dolomitici \u2013 or Dolomighty ones. The German spoken officially with Italian throughout the province gives way in the Alta Badia ski region to Ladin, an ancient Romance language preserved and spoken by a majority in the valleys around Corvara. Food here reflects the memory of a more difficult mountain existence as well as its prosperity today: the two menus it promotes for skiers are, first, the more delicate, nuanced dishes invented by its guest chefs; second, the local, traditional food best appreciated for surviving hiking up a snowy mountain. For the latter, the best-known Ladin restaurant is Maso Runch-Hof. Runch (pronounced to rhyme with bunk, rather than massive lunch) is the home and institution of one family. Frau Nagler and sons cook while Herr Nagler is front of house, with the face of a benevolent Sid James and an alarmingly large bottle of home-made schnapps, brought to help digest the seven courses on the fixed menu. My fellow diner \u2013 a local, Ladin connoisseur \u2013 testifies to the quality of Runch's specialities of tutres and canci. These are varying shapes and sizes of doughnut- and pancake-like concoctions as well as ravioli: spinach, cheese or sweet poppy-seed fillings wrapped in various types of batter, coming plate after plate. Runch could give Aviemore hoteliers hope for a tasting menu built around the deep-fried Mars bar. The host and waitresses look bemused as we decline extra helpings, but the volume of the average human stomach could surely manage little more than the excellent, hearty panicia barley soup and p\u00fccia crispbreads and a nibble at the main course, a ham hock that would keep an entire von Trapp family busy. It feels slightly surreal, even before a middle-aged man in shorts and a green-feathered cap comes in with his accordion to sing. But the high camp of the Alps is not restricted to Ladin agriturismo: the hotel La Perla, located metres from the Cap Alt cable car, puts on a bizarrely enjoyable show for its guests. Not in its L'Murin barn-turned-club complete with go-go dancers; nor even in its underground spa, where ageing, naked Germans wade solemnly anticlockwise between icy and warm paddling pools to boost their circulation. La Perla's real coup de theatre is its wine cellars: and while there are some proud collections in its 30,000 bottles, what truly astonishes is the effort and imagination that has gone into creating something entirely unexpected. Without overly spoiling the surprise for future guests, it's as if the hotel had Adam Curtis and Willy Wonka on stage design. Calling it the Mahatma cellar may be something of a dubious tribute to the ascetic Gandhi, but this is a tour to delight non-drinkers as much as wine gluggers, from the moment the sommelier starts dancing in the first vault. Up the cellar's fireman's pole is the St\u00fca de Michil \u2013 La Perla's own Michelin-starred restaurant, where concoctions such as veal tongue and octopus are served up for the gourmand (with one refined main dish costing more than a night at the Runch). This room is one of numerous stubes, or traditional parlour rooms, where guests can dine: each is different, but with the essential decor of wooden panels on floor, wall and ceiling, a throwback to the past when only one warm room in the house would serve, thus insulated, as a place for the family to congregate, cook, eat and sleep \u2013 on top of the oven. As if to lure the holidaying gastronome out of the resort and on to the ski slope, Alta Badia's plusher mountain huts have also launched skiing taste trails \u2013 one traditionally Ladin, one the creation of a consortium of South Tyrol's Michelin-starred sons. The Ladin menus can be found in the slopes leading up to the magnificent peak of Santa Croce: close up, the Dolomite rock is a more colourful, coffee stone than the sombre grey it appears when viewed across the Alps. In this former place of pilgrimage, where a simple Catholic chapel still stands, skiers can now walk up the last stretch from the highest lift to try Ladin delicacies at the Crusc hut \u2013 although the p\u00f6ssl I tried would be recognised through the Alps as what Austrians call Kaiserschmarrn, a thick mishmash of shredded pancakes and red-fruit compote. Elsewhere, for the chef chasers, are 11 huts in each of which one dish has been specially created by a Michelin-starred son of Tyrol. At the Pralongia, for example, there is pork belly with Indian spices on kraut with a grappa-soaked plum sauce \u2013 and, given ski-slope mark-ups, they are not unreasonably priced at \u20ac12-25. Then you've just got to ski back down. The slopes here aren't as vertiginous as some. There are some great long red runs, including the majority of the 26km Sella Ronda circuit that can be skied in one energetic day. A combined Dolomiti Superski pass links 1,200km of pistes in a dozen resorts around Alta Badia, joined by long stretches of almost horizontal lifts. That means many chair lifts give the disconcerting sight of rows of skiers heading towards each other rather than all going up a mountain \u2013 grateful, perhaps, for a chance to digest all that rich food. Essentials British Airways (ba.com) flies daily from Gatwick to Verona, with fares from \u00a380.60. Hotel La Perla (hotel-laperla.it) has rooms from \u00a4320 per night, including breakfast.

      "bodyText": "Watching the way the Civil Wars' John Paul White and Joy Williams talk together is almost as pleasing as listening to them play. We're in Williams's enormous sun-drenched kitchen in Nashville, she pouring tea while he grips an enormous coffee. She beams, he broods. He's soft-spoken, still and implacable. She's prone to big bursts of hearty laughter, usually in response to his deadpanned retorts. And yet these two almost comically different souls seem to have some kind of quiet, deeply felt understanding; I'm not surprised they get mistaken for a married couple. Their stripped-back duets are simple \u2013 hushed and intense Americana full of tales of heartache and hard times \u2013 but it's the interplay and rise and fall of their two voices that makes them extraordinary. The two met three years ago at a camp for songwriters, both disillusioned with the business and despondent about ever making careers of their own. They were paired up, put in a room together to write and what happened next made the hairs on both of their necks stand on end. \"As soon as we started to sing together it was like we'd been doing it for generations,\" says White with his long southern vowels. \"Like our parents had been doing it and their parents had, like a brother-sister thing, from the womb to where there was this subconscious thing that meant we didn't have to say anything.\" Williams picks up the story: \"I remember going back to my husband that day and saying, 'I just met this guy!' Which is not,\" she laughs, \"the normal way of speaking to your husband!\" While Williams grew up on the west coast, raised on pop and jazz, White, \"down on the Alabama-Tennessee line\", is steeped in blues and country. They come from pretty divergent places musically, then, I prompt. \"Well, we come from very divergent places, period,\" says White. A big laugh from Williams: \"In every way!\" \"I feel like we pull from each other's world so it becomes something actually larger than the two of us,\" says White. \"Every time we sit down it starts flowing, immediately. And that's pretty uncommon.\" Williams enthuses that \"it creates this very\u2026 very atmospheric place to create within that feels safe and feels totally free and... I just can't... \" She gives up, grinning and bashful. \"You've caught us in a very good mood today.\" That might have something to do with just having won two Grammys. Two weeks after the US release of their debut album, Barton Hollow, the pair were awarded best country duo/group performance (for the album's title track) and best folk album. \"It's just like a strange little acid flashback I'm having,\" says White, recalling the ceremony. \"You spend your entire life dreaming of those sorts of things, watching those shows as you grow up and it happens and it's pretty overwhelming. I went back home and it's just, you know: take out the trash, clean out the toilet... honestly, I have to look back at pictures to make sure it actually happened.\" For her part, Williams remembers climbing the steps to the stage and thinking: \"I'm going to die. I'm going to faint, right here. I'm going to fall in these four-inch heels that I never wear and I'm going to die. And then the second stair was I remembered a conversation I'd had backstage with Adele\u2026 \" White, poker-faced, adds: \"She's a singer.\" Civil Wars supported Adele on tour after she said that \"they are the best live band I have ever seen\". They also have an effusive fan and friend in Taylor Swift. When Williams talks about being backstage at the Grammys and seeing Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt \"and Chris Martin, just chasing after his children...\", White interjects: \"I didn't meet any of those people; I think it's for the best. I just assume the gods stay up on the pedestal and don't speak to the peasants.\" But Williams relayed back to him \"the sweet things they had to say\". What kind of things? \"They... they... said they were fans.\" He stresses the word, incredulous. \"And that kind of freaks me out.\" While White's hands remain locked around his cup, Williams touches the curve of her belly; she and her husband, Nate, who is also the band's manager, are expecting their first child in June. The baby kicked throughout the Grammys: \"That will always remain a really sweet memory to me: sharing the stage with John Paul and my husband and my baby. It's been,\" she adds, \"a sweet, sweet season.\" And it's been a long time coming for both of them. \"It's very cliched to say follow your heart,\" says White. \"We'd heard it all our lives, but you have to get to a place where you just don't care any more about anything but wellbeing. You have to have a little bit of heartache and hit some walls.\" Williams gives the slow nod of an old timer: \"We hit plenty of walls before meeting each other.\" Her recording career began when she was just 17 with the first of three albums on the Christian music label Reunion Records. I tell her how I find it hard to square the girl-next-door blonde of those album covers with the woman in front of me. She nods and laughs, sheepishly. \"Literally and figuratively, I went back to my roots \u2013 I am a natural brunette, let the record show! It seems like an entirely different era of my life. It's as if my high school year book is up for everybody to see at any point in time. I started so young, I had no idea who I really was or who I wanted to become.\" But after she and White paired up, things moved fast. In 2009, their second ever show was released as a free album, Live at Eddie's Attic, and they received a huge boost after their \"Poison &amp; Wine\" was played on the TV show Grey's Anatomy. Last October's Jools Holland appearance was another key moment: minutes after they performed their stirring, bluesy duet \"Barton Hollow\", the phrase \"TheCivilWars\" was trending on Twitter. I ask them what they think it is about them that's struck such a chord. White doesn't miss a beat. \"Me,\" he says. Williams laughs. \"And his humility.\" \"I would like to think,\" adds White, \"that people believe that we truly, truly love what we do and what we sing every single day. If I see somebody just mailing it in, it's obvious. We all know there's a lot of people out there doing that and I think people are sick of it, honestly. My dad says \u2013 and he's not a music guy at all, but he's an old-school country fan \u2013 he says people always gravitate back toward that kind of music when times are tough... people gravitate away from sights and move more towards the sounds.\" And Williams, who's been watching him intently, adds: \"There's an ebb and flow to the active listening of each other... it's a perpetual conversation.\" I leave them talking.",

      "body": "<p>Watching the way the Civil Wars' John Paul White and Joy Williams talk together is almost as pleasing as listening to them play. We're in Williams's enormous sun-drenched kitchen in Nashville, she pouring tea while he grips an enormous coffee. She&#xa0;beams, he broods. He's soft-spoken,&#xa0;still and implacable. She's prone&#xa0;to big bursts of hearty laughter, usually in response to his deadpanned&#xa0;retorts. And yet these two almost comically different souls seem to have some kind of quiet, deeply felt understanding; I'm not surprised they get mistaken for a married couple.</p> <p>Their stripped-back duets are simple \u2013 hushed and intense Americana full of tales of heartache and hard times \u2013 but it's the interplay and rise and fall of their two voices that makes them extraordinary.</p> <p>The two met three years ago at a camp for songwriters, both disillusioned with the business and despondent about ever making careers of their own. They were paired up, put in a room together to write and what happened next made the hairs on both of their necks stand on end.</p> <p>\"As soon as we started to sing together it was like we'd been doing it for generations,\" says White with his long southern vowels. \"Like our parents had been doing it and their parents had, like a brother-sister thing, from the womb to where there was this subconscious thing that meant we didn't have to say anything.\"</p> <p>Williams picks up the story: \"I remember going back to my husband that day and saying, 'I just met this <em>guy</em>!' Which is not,\" she laughs, \"the normal way of speaking to your husband!\"</p> <p>While Williams grew up on the west coast, raised on pop and jazz, White, \"down on the Alabama-Tennessee line\", is steeped in blues and country. They come from pretty divergent places musically, then, I prompt.</p> <p>\"Well, we come from very divergent places, period,\" says White. A big laugh from Williams: \"In every way!\"</p> <p>\"I feel like we pull from each other's world so it becomes something actually larger than the two of us,\" says White. \"Every time we sit down it starts flowing, immediately. And that's pretty uncommon.\"</p> <p>Williams enthuses that \"it creates this very\u2026 very atmospheric place to create within that feels safe and feels totally free and... I just can't... \" She gives up, grinning and bashful. \"You've caught us in a very good mood today.\"</p> <p>That might have something to do with just having won two Grammys. Two weeks after the US release of their debut album, <em>Barton Hollow</em>, the pair were awarded best country duo/group performance (for the album's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sxsw/artist?mbid=91dad7e7-0bf6-47e8-bd42-ef1fac32c729\" title=\"\">title track</a>) and best folk album.</p> <p>\"It's just like a strange little acid flashback I'm having,\" says White, recalling the ceremony. \"You spend your entire life dreaming of those sorts of things, watching those shows as you grow up and it happens and it's pretty overwhelming. I went back home and it's just, you know: take out the trash, clean out the toilet... honestly, I have to look back at pictures to make sure it actually happened.\"</p> <p>For her part, Williams remembers climbing the steps to the stage and thinking: \"I'm going to die. I'm going&#xa0;to&#xa0;faint, right here. I'm going to fall in these four-inch heels that I never&#xa0;wear and I'm going to die. And then the second stair was I remembered a conversation I'd had backstage with Adele\u2026 \"</p> <p>White, poker-faced, adds: \"She's a singer.\"</p> <p>Civil Wars supported Adele on tour after she said that \"they are the <em>best</em> live band I have <em>ever</em> seen\". They also have an effusive fan and friend in Taylor Swift.</p> <p>When Williams talks about being backstage at the Grammys and seeing Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt \"and Chris Martin, just chasing after his children...\", White interjects: \"<em>I</em> didn't meet any of those people; I think it's for the best. I just assume the gods stay up on the pedestal and don't speak to the peasants.\"</p> <p>But Williams relayed back to him \"the sweet things they had to say\".</p> <p>What kind of things?</p> <p>\"They... they... said they were <em>fans</em>.\" He stresses the word, incredulous. \"And that kind of freaks me out.\"</p> <p>While White's hands remain locked around his cup, Williams touches the curve of her belly; she and her husband, Nate, who is also the band's manager, are expecting their first child in June. The baby kicked throughout the Grammys: \"That will always remain a really sweet memory to me: sharing the stage with John Paul and my husband and my baby. It's been,\" she adds, \"a sweet, sweet season.\"</p> <p>And it's been a long time coming for both of them. \"It's very cliched to say follow your heart,\" says White. \"We'd heard it all our lives, but you have to get to a place where you just don't care any more about anything but wellbeing. You have to have a little bit of heartache and hit some walls.\"</p> <p>Williams gives the slow nod of an old timer: \"We hit plenty of walls before meeting each other.\"</p> <p>Her recording career began when she was just 17 with the first of three albums on the Christian music label Reunion Records. I tell her how I find it hard to square the girl-next-door blonde of those album covers with the woman in front of me.</p> <p>She nods and laughs, sheepishly. \"Literally and figuratively, I went back to my roots \u2013 I am a natural brunette, let the record show! It seems like an entirely different era of my life. It's as if my high school year book is up for everybody to see at any point in time. I started so young, I had no idea who I really was or who I wanted to become.\"</p> <p>But after she and White paired up, things moved fast. In 2009, their second ever show was released as a free album, <em>Live at Eddie's Attic</em>, and they received a huge boost after their \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-6EwdDiopQ\" title=\"\">Poison &amp; Wine</a>\" was played on the TV show <em>Grey's Anatomy</em>. Last October's Jools Holland appearance was another key moment: minutes after they performed their stirring, bluesy duet \"Barton Hollow\", the phrase \"TheCivilWars\" was trending on Twitter.</p> <p>I ask them what they think it is about them that's struck such a chord. White doesn't miss a beat.</p> <p>\"Me,\" he says.</p> <p>Williams laughs. \"And his humility.\"</p> <p>\"I would like to think,\" adds White, \"that people believe that we truly, truly love what we do and what we sing every single day. If I see somebody just mailing it in, it's obvious. We all know there's a lot of people out there doing that and I think people are sick of it, honestly. My dad says \u2013 and he's not a music guy at all, but he's an old-school country fan \u2013 he says people always gravitate back toward that kind of music when times are tough... people gravitate away from sights and move more towards the sounds.\"</p> <p>And Williams, who's been watching him intently, adds: \"There's an ebb and flow to the active listening of each other... it's a perpetual conversation.\"</p> <p>I leave them talking.</p>",

It was found growing on vertical rocky faces and outcrops along the Welmel River in southern Ethiopia. Sap from its leaves is used to relieve pain associated with ear infections and warmed leaves are said to treat headaches and rheumatism. Regrettably, the new species is also considered to be critically endangered. The team describing the new plants, led by Sebsebe Demissew of the Ethiopian National Herbarium in Addis Ababa, discussed the ethical requirements incumbent upon botanists and collectors to comply with Cites and other regulations designed to protect threatened species. They also discussed the recent case of an endangered plant species illegally transported to the US and described as new. In the ensuing legal chaos, material was confiscated by the government and there ended up being no type specimen in any herbarium as a permanent record of the identity or geographic origin of the species. While compliance with laws and ethical behaviour are minimum expectations of everyone involved in species exploration, this reminds us of the many challenges associated with working across national borders. Taxonomists become experts by learning all the species in a higher taxon and the evolutionary history that explains their diversity. This kind of knowledge is only possible by studying species regardless of where they occur or how many geopolitical borders they cross. Just as studying earthquakes or plate tectonics requires a global perspective, so does reconstructing the origin of biodiversity. With this worldwide reach, however, comes the responsibility to share all the data, information, and knowledge gained with all nations, especially countries of origin. Knowledge of the biosphere is ultimately the intellectual property and heritage of humanity. No country has, or can afford to have, experts on every kind of living thing, so comprehensive knowledge of species, whether those of a single ecosystem or the whole biosphere, is dependent on international collaboration. As specimens and data are digitised, it is becoming much easier to repatriate data, share discoveries, and work cooperatively. Where specimens are deposited is becoming far less important than that they are conserved for posterity and made openly accessible. The authors have reminded us that the pressures of the biodiversity crisis and maturation of taxonomy mean that it is time to reassess international agreements so that we simultaneously protect species, honour national sovereignty, and advance the growth of scientific knowledge.

      "bodyText": "No one really comes to a Bruce Springsteen album looking for subtlety. But there have been few Springsteen albums that so resemble a sledgehammer holding a megaphone as Wrecking Ball, his 17th. More rousing than The Rising, more polemical than his album of Pete Seeger sessions, Wrecking Ball deploys biblical imagery, train metaphors, Irish rebel reels, mariachi horns and even the sax solos of the late Clarence Clemons on an album in which the bankers get it in the neck so hard, some wags have already subtitled it Occupy NJ. It's an election year, and the Boss is mobilising, employing mainstream producer Ron Aniello to make these big, unambiguous tunes punch hard on modern rock radio. It is very hard to disagree with Springsteen on substance. Released last month, \"We Take Care of Our Own\" set the record's inflammatory tone. Has there been a song since \"Born in the USA\" in which Springsteen has hitched such air-punching music to such vituperative words? \"We take care of our own,\" sneers Springsteen, contrasting the fluttering flag with the betrayed victims of Hurricane Katrina. Wrecking Ball is not a dyspeptic protest record, however. Springsteen has chosen to smuggle his most explicit critiques of power into songs that rollick and whoop. The title track takes as its starting point the demolition of the New York Giants football stadium. Swiftly, though, it becomes a cheery, brassy last stand against the bulldozers of big money, wherever they may roll. This is, then, good-time music for bad times. The Pogues-like \"Death to My Hometown\" uses fiddles, big choruses (\"Death to our hometown, boys!\"), and even a small explosion to point out that capitalism wreaks more destruction than war. Springsteen has been hanging out with Celtic punk band the Dropkick Murphys, and you can hear it. More contemplatively, \"Jack of All Trades\" finds one of Springsteen's stoic blue-collar guys forced into less than dignified labour, keeping hopeful but ending up murderous. \"If I had me a gun/ I'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight,\" he concludes. And that's all before the righteous dead start talking on \"We Are Alive\". Recalling the chatty wormfood of \"In Flanders Fields\", John McCrae's first world war poem, slain civil rights activists and union protesters end the album by reminding us to hold the torch high. No pressure, then. For all this tuneful righteousness, you do yearn for some of the oblique strategies of last year's key protest album, PJ Harvey's Let England Shake. \"Death to My Hometown\" carries African influences as well as the lurch of the Irish, but they are almost lost. Even as you understand Wrecking Ball's aims, the album's calculations are a little too plain to see: its desire to rally too naked, its tropes too worn, its bluntness too blunt. \"You've Got It\" \u2013 a brawny love song \u2013 comes as welcome respite from all the tub-thumping. You want this record to sell by the barrowload, but you might not actually want to play it that often.",

The Pogues-like \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UASyS-jUKKI\" title=\"\">Death to My Hometown</a>\" uses fiddles, big choruses (\"Death to our hometown, boys!\"), and even a small explosion to point out that capitalism wreaks more destruction than war. Springsteen has been hanging out with Celtic punk band <a href=\"http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/\" title=\"\">the Dropkick Murphys</a>, and you can hear it.</p> <p>More contemplatively, \"Jack of All Trades\" finds one of Springsteen's stoic blue-collar guys forced into less than dignified labour, keeping hopeful but ending up murderous. \"If I had me a gun/ I'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight,\" he concludes. And that's all before the righteous dead start talking on \"We Are Alive\". Recalling the chatty wormfood of \"<a href=\"http://www.greatwar.co.uk/poems/john-mccrae-in-flanders-fields.htm\" title=\"\">In Flanders Fields</a>\", John McCrae's first world war poem, slain civil rights activists and union protesters end the album by reminding us to hold the torch high. No pressure, then.</p> <p>For all this tuneful righteousness, you do yearn for some of the oblique strategies of last year's key protest album, PJ Harvey's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urGMpYqX2c&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\"><em>Let England Shake</em></a>. \"Death to My Hometown\" carries African influences as well as the lurch of the Irish, but they are almost lost. Even as you understand <em>Wrecking Ball</em>'s aims, the album's calculations are a little too plain to see: its desire to rally too naked, its tropes too worn, its bluntness too blunt. \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RtJHZwDpXc\" title=\"\">You've Got It</a>\" \u2013 a brawny love song \u2013 comes as welcome respite from all the tub-thumping. You want this record to sell by the barrowload, but you might not actually want to play it that often.</p>",

All of a sudden the devastated looks on their haggard faces is explained. Who says this? It is \"Scotty Bowers\"\u2013 a name that had me thinking of the Bowers who perished with the great, gloomy Scott 100 years ago in the Antarctic; if only our author had been in that tent. And you almost feel he might have been, to judge by Gore Vidal's endorsement of this book: \"I have known Scotty Bowers the better part of a century \u2026 Scotty doesn't lie.\" Neither does he supply his book with an index, so if you're interested in the secret sex lives of the stars, you are going to have to search through these pages for Spence and Kate, Eddie and Wally, Randy and Cary, Rock, Ty and Noel, and Vivien Leigh, who seems to have been the most enthusiastic and voluble bedmate of them all. Scotty had so noisy a fling with her (it's pp 158-61) that he was certain they must have woken George Cukor in a nearby room. Where's the harm in that? Don't we all know now \u2013 those of us who care \u2013 that George gave Viv secret coaching after he'd been fired from Gone With the Wind? In which case, his being privy to her orgasmic outcries must have enrouged her Scarlett. The secret lives of the stars exist only to make their screened moments shine with glamour and mystery. Bowers is still alive (in his late 80s) and I suspect he's a more interesting man than his memoir discloses. He was a marine who saw active service in the Pacific, and then he settled in Los Angeles, first as a gas pump attendant and then as a barman and unofficial trickster at Hollywood parties. He was very good-looking, and flexible, so the \"tricking\" he speaks of began as servicing men who wanted blow jobs or more \u2013 Walter Pidgeon (Mr Miniver!) started him off, which says a good deal about the wartime suspension of marital relations in the film Mrs Miniver. Quite quickly, Scotty became not just a trick but a bringer of tricks \u2013 an intermediary, a connection \u2013 as well as a participant. A good deal of this was done for closeted homosexuals at a time when the gay element in Hollywood lived with the threat and the thrill of exposure, while working in a medium that encouraged all of us to fall in love with male and female role models. Not many of the names outed in this book have not been outed before, and now that they are all dead it is hard for the ordinary stargazer to know what to believe or trust. The true secret lives of the stars were the imagined existences we gave to them. And so in a business dedicated to storytelling, the possibility of fiction easily eclipses the vulnerability of fact. We'll never know, but that is the threshold of exquisite wondering. There's only one test case that still stirs up controversy, and it concerns the legend of Kate and Spence. In 2006, William Mann published Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn, which is the best book written on Hepburn and her dream of herself. Mann had certainly talked to Bowers and his book claimed that \"Kate and Spence\" was a publicist's fabrication for the most part, albeit one that involved great affection and an on-screen partnership (nine films) that rescued their careers and which was to the glory and benefit of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a studio skilled at public relations. Whereas, in fact, said Mann, Tracy and Hepburn both had gay sides to their lives. Many fans of the legend were upset by this. Just last year, James Curtis published an immense and eminently researched life of Spencer Tracy that included an author's note on \"the biographies of Katharine Hepburn\" which said: \"Bowers is full of glib stories and revelations, all cheerfully unverifiable.\" Curtis went on to say: \"There is no hint of homosexual activity in the Tracy papers nor in anything I have seen or learned elsewhere during the course of researching this book.\" That is the fruit of six years' serious work, and not to be taken lightly. At the same time, I believe Hepburn did have an active gay life, such as Bowers alleges. For the moment, this is a topic, but soon it will fade away. In that future age it will be easier to see that movie stars and celebrities were and are in the business of mystifying fact and generating stories about themselves. That is a trick we are all learning that is gradually undermining the pursuit of \u2013 or the hope for \u2013 history. David Thomson is the author of Have You Seen?

In 2006, William Mann published <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/stage/9780571229772/kate-the-woman-who-was-hepburn\" title=\"\"><em>Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn</em></a>, which is the best book written on Hepburn and her dream of herself. Mann had certainly talked to Bowers and his book claimed that \"Kate and Spence\" was a publicist's fabrication for the most part, albeit one that involved great affection and an on-screen partnership (nine films) that rescued their careers and which was to the glory and benefit of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a studio skilled at public relations. Whereas, in fact, said Mann, Tracy and Hepburn both had gay sides to their lives.</p> <p>Many fans of the legend were upset by this. Just last year, James Curtis published an immense and eminently researched life of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/film/9780099547297/spencer-tracy\" title=\"\">Spencer Tracy</a> that included an author's note on \"the biographies of Katharine Hepburn\" which said: \"Bowers is full of glib stories and revelations, all cheerfully unverifiable.\" Curtis went on to say: \"There is no hint of homosexual activity in the Tracy papers nor in anything I have seen or learned elsewhere during the course of researching this book.\"</p> <p>That is the fruit of six years' serious work, and not to be taken lightly. At the same time, I believe Hepburn did have an active gay life, such as Bowers alleges. For the moment, this is a topic,&#xa0;but soon it will fade away. In&#xa0;that&#xa0;future age it will be easier to see&#xa0;that movie stars and celebrities were and are in the business of mystifying fact and generating stories about themselves. That is a trick we are all learning that is gradually undermining the pursuit of \u2013 or the hope for \u2013 history.</p> <p><em>David Thomson is the author of </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/film/9780141020754/have-you-seen-a-personal-introduction-to-films-including-masterpieces-oddities-and-guilty-pleasures-with-just-a-few-disasters\" title=\"\"><em>Have You Seen?</em></a><em> (Penguin) and </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/film/9780465003396/the-moment-of-psycho-how-alfred-hitchcock-taught-america-to-love-murder\" title=\"\"><em>The Moment of Psycho</em></a><em> (Faber).</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The German novelist Hans Fallada is one of the more unlikely success stories of recent years. Born Rudolf Ditzen in 1893, Fallada (a pen-name based on a composite of characters from the Brothers Grimm) was lucky even to make it beyond adolescence, surviving a traffic accident, serious illness and repeated suicide attempts before he was out of his teens. During the 1920s, he spent several periods in prison on account of his morphine addiction; even when the success of his novel Little Man, What Now? finally brought him financial stability in 1932, the rise of Nazism heralded new anxieties. Over the course of the 30s, Fallada was in turns alienated and appropriated by the Nazis, and the embittered novelist, increasingly driven by alcohol, spent the years leading up to his death in 1947 in a variety of institutions (after allegedly attempting to kill his wife in 1944). Despite his considerable success, Fallada's life ended in sorry failure. Yet in the last months of his life Fallada had completed the manuscript that would ensure his eventual renaissance. Published for the first time in English in 2009, Alone in Berlin tells the true story of an ordinary Berlin couple and their acts of resistance to the Nazi authorities. The astonishing international success of Michael Hofmann's English translation has been well documented. Can it be repeated with one of Fallada's earlier books? Originally published in 1931 as Farmers, Functionaries and Fireworks, A Small Circus (the author's preferred title) was Fallada's first novel of note, earning praise from figures as disparate as Hermann Hesse, Robert Musil and Joseph Goebbels. It is, in many ways, more representative of Fallada's oeuvre than Alone in Berlin, since it vividly depicts the provincial politics and internecine squabbling of the Weimar republic (the subject of much of his best work). Fallada describes the tensions in the small north German town of Altholm between farmers, journalists, businessmen and politicians, with the action turning around a farmers' demonstration and its consequences for the local community. If it lacks the intensity and focus of Fallada's last book, this very lack of focus is an accurate representation of the fissiparous energy of the Weimar years: a novel without a hero for an age without a hero. The gallery of small-town characters is essentially comic, from the provincial journalists dreaming of life in the big city to the self-important local functionaries and civil servants. The Weimar republic certainly offers rich material for comedy, and Fallada vividly captures the ineptitude of its political system: the contested flag borne proudly by the farmers at the head of their demonstration, and incompetently confiscated by the local police, provides an appropriate emblem of both the pettiness and the incipient nationalism of these republican years. Indeed, the novel is full of metonyms for the chaos of the period, from the \"small circus\" of the title to the peasants' revolt of the farmers' movement. As Fallada notes in the original foreword: \"My small town stands for a thousand others.\" The comedy of the 20s, however, would become the tragedy of the 30s, and it is impossible to read the novel now without feeling the weight of subsequent events. The appendix to the English edition, contrasting election results from 1928 and 1930, demonstrates the startling gains made by Hitler in this period, and bears out the farmers' claim that the \"Reds and the Nazis are given their head, we farmers are placed under emergency law\". The mayor's closing assurances that it will all be better if they move to a new town ring necessarily hollow: it is precisely such provincial bickering that allowed the Nazis to engineer their dramatic rise to power. Stylistically, the novel is typical of the so-called \"new sobriety\" of the period. The story is driven by dialogue, and Fallada's language is accordingly colloquial and direct; Hofmann responds to the demotic ebullience of the German with his usual flair (despite occasional anachronisms such as \"nuts\" and \"no probs\"). Given the overwhelming concentration on the city in modernist writing of the 20s and 30s, it is refreshing to encounter a small-town perspective, and indeed this may be the novel's most enduring contribution. Fallada's own experiences as a regional journalist in north Germany underlie the action, and it is this sense of realism, combined with an ear for dialogue and an acute understanding of human frailty, that make the novel such an authentic portrayal of an imploding era. Kurt Tucholsky's judgment of 1931 remains the most accurate: \"It is no great work of art, but it is so terribly genuine that it's frightening.\"",

      "bodyText": "According to Walter Bagehot, Dickens described London \"like a special correspondent for posterity\". Dickens was a reporter before he became a novelist, and his reporter's instincts remained strong, especially in his \"condition of England\" novels, from Bleak House to Our Mutual Friend. John Lanchester also has a reputation as a reporter and as a novelist, and with this \"big, fat London novel\" he is writing a report on London in 2008, peopling it with fictional but precisely observed Londoners \u2013 a touch of Mayhew as well as Dickens. His documentation is sharp and vivid as he follows their adventures: now we know what it feels like not to get your expected bonus at the bank, and what it's like to be arrested before dawn, manhandled, handcuffed and carried off to a police cell without explanation or any mention of your rights as a citizen. The book follows a small cross-section of the inhabitants of one south London street, and the people who come to work for them, over a year, in which the settled citizens interact with the newcomers who are trying to negotiate a place for themselves in British society. Among them are a Polish man working as a builder, a well-educated Hungarian woman who takes a job as a nanny, a Senegalese footballer being groomed for stardom at great expense, and also Quentina, a hated local traffic warden, who is a political refugee from Zimbabwe with a university degree, and can support herself only by paying for a forged work permit. All of them have to be tough, drawing on their wits, prepared to adapt themselves to what is required, ready to accept and brush aside humiliation. Their experience of London counterpoints with that of the luckier inhabitants. The street Lanchester has imagined, Pepys Road, is one built for lower middle-class families in the late 19th century, and the story begins in December 2007, when the value of each house has risen so spectacularly that the people who currently own them are all rich, and have done much knocking through and enlargement of attics and basements, congratulating themselves on their good luck as they do so. \"Having a house in Pepys Road was like being in a casino in which you were guaranteed to be a winner. If you already lived there, you were rich. If you wanted to move there, you had to be rich. It was the first time in history this had ever been true\" \u2013 a truth universally acknowledged by house-owning Londoners. There is one exception to the guaranteed wealth of the Pepys Road residents: the small modern shop at the end of the road, run by Ahmed Kamal, born in Lahore, with his wife and brothers. The Kamals are given the most dramatic turn of events to deal with when Ahmed's clever, computer-wise, free-spirited brother Shahid is arrested on suspicion of being a terrorist. His incarceration in a cell in Paddington Green police station is grim \u2013 he is unable to communicate with anyone in the outside world, and is persistently questioned and accused \u2013 although the police are shown to behave correctly, if mistakenly. A turning point comes for Shahid when, disoriented and reduced almost to despair in his smelly cell, he is brought his Qur'an by the lawyer his family finally gets to him. He begins to pray, and to feel that, although he is alone, he is alone before Allah; and \"the exhilarating bleakness of the desert faith\" comforts him. Earlier, Shahid has expressed contempt for the pagan nature of Christmas celebrations in London, all drunkenness and shopping. We see his point. One other reference to religion comes at the funeral of an elderly widow, Petunia Howe, the last inhabitant of Pepys Road to have been born there, who has asked for the service to be read from the Book of Common Prayer, in defiance of her late husband's atheism. A kind-faced, decent Church of England woman priest reads the service, and the great words are heard respectfully by her grieving daughter and by the Polish builder Zbigniew, who has seen Petunia on her deathbed while working on the house, and attends the funeral, as do the Kamals, respecting the dignity of death, which is the same for all. Petunia's final experience of life in London has not been good: unaware of the colossal value of the house she inhabits, she has struggled with worrying symptoms to a surgery where she never sees the same doctor twice, and then to a vast hospital where the consultant's appointments are all fixed for the same time slot, ensuring that patients, however old, nervous and frail, have to wait for hours to be told whether they should expect to live or die. Petunia rejects the offered chemotherapy and you can see why. In one of the biggest and smartest houses in Pepys Road live Roger and Arabella Yount with their two small sons. He is a tall, good-natured Harrovian working in a City bank, his values closer to the old City, where everything depended on who you knew and how well you blended in, rather than the new City of risk and drug-taking. He married Arabella because she seemed to have a gift for making life seem easy, but the births of their sons have left her cross and resentful, and she has become addicted to shopping, spending, fashion, brochures and alcoholic lunches with a woman friend. Arabella is the nastiest character in the book, a bit too close to Ab Fab to be quite believable \u2013 selfish, vindictive and vacuous. In fine contrast is Matya, the hard-working and honourable Hungarian who comes to look after the Yount children. She falls in love at first sight with toddler Josh, and he with her. Lanchester notices that adults fall in love with small children and describes it truthfully: he has an eye for aspects of human behaviour that are not often acknowledged. In his book, all the Londoners of foreign origin appear as more industrious than the native born; not surprisingly, perhaps, given that they are struggling to make their way from nothing and against the odds. But they are also shown as having better instincts: they have not yet been corrupted by the consumer society. Zbigniew appreciates the beauty of the lush overgrown garden at the back of Petunia's house, and regrets its destruction. Whereas for Roger a terrible moment of truth comes when, after the bank crash, he finds for the first time in his adult life that he has to worry about a taxi fare of \u00a330. A few strands of the narrative don't quite work, but the best ones make you turn the pages faster to find out where they are going. There is a moral fable about money, so neatly done that its resolution comes as a shock. A near-sentimental tale of the conversion of Zbigniew from careless sexual predator into tremulous romantic suitor is also nicely handled. And if Lanchester chooses to reveal character largely through action and daily experiences, it makes the moments when he does open up an inner life at a turning point all the more striking. He tells a good story. He gives you a lot to think about. This is an intelligent and entertaining account of our grubby, uncertain, fragmented London society that has almost replaced religion with shopping. Read it.

A turning point comes for Shahid when, disoriented and reduced almost to despair in his smelly cell, he is brought his Qur'an by the lawyer his family finally gets to him. He begins to pray, and to feel that, although he is alone, he is alone before Allah; and \"the exhilarating bleakness of the desert faith\" comforts him. Earlier, Shahid has expressed contempt for the pagan nature of Christmas celebrations in London, all drunkenness and shopping. We see his point.</p> <p>One other reference to religion comes at the funeral of an elderly widow, Petunia Howe, the last inhabitant of Pepys Road to have been born there, who has asked for the service to be read from the Book of Common Prayer, in defiance of her late husband's atheism. A kind-faced, decent Church of England woman priest reads the service, and the great words are heard respectfully by her grieving daughter and by the Polish builder Zbigniew, who has seen Petunia on her deathbed while working on the house, and attends the funeral, as do the Kamals, respecting the dignity of death, which is the same for all. Petunia's final experience of life in London has not been good: unaware of the colossal value of the house she inhabits, she has struggled with worrying symptoms to a surgery where she never sees the same doctor twice, and then to a vast hospital where the consultant's appointments are all fixed for the same time slot, ensuring that patients, however old, nervous and frail, have to wait for hours to be told whether they should expect to live or die. Petunia rejects the offered chemotherapy and you can see why.</p> <p>In one of the biggest and smartest houses in Pepys Road live Roger and Arabella Yount with their two small sons. He is a tall, good-natured Harrovian working in a City bank, his values closer to the old City, where everything depended on who you knew and how well you blended in, rather than the new City of risk and drug-taking. He married Arabella because she seemed to have a gift for making life seem easy, but the births of their sons have left her cross and resentful, and she has become addicted to shopping, spending, fashion, brochures and alcoholic lunches with a woman friend. Arabella is the nastiest character in the book, a bit too close to <em>Ab Fab</em> to be quite believable \u2013 selfish, vindictive and vacuous. In fine contrast is Matya, the hard-working and honourable Hungarian who comes to look after the Yount children. She falls in love at first sight with toddler Josh, and he with her. Lanchester notices that adults fall in love with small children and describes it truthfully: he has an eye for aspects of human behaviour that are not often acknowledged.</p> <p>In his book, all the Londoners of foreign origin appear as more industrious than the native born; not surprisingly, perhaps, given that they are struggling to make their way from nothing and against the odds. But they are also shown as having better instincts: they have not yet been corrupted by the consumer society. Zbigniew appreciates the beauty of the lush overgrown garden at the back of Petunia's house, and regrets its destruction. Whereas for Roger a terrible moment of truth comes when, after the bank crash, he finds for the first time in his adult life that he has to worry about a taxi fare of \u00a330.</p> <p>A few strands of the narrative don't quite work, but the best ones make you turn the pages faster to find out where they are going. There is a moral fable about money, so neatly done that its resolution comes as a shock. A near-sentimental tale of the conversion of Zbigniew from careless sexual predator into tremulous romantic suitor is also nicely handled. And if Lanchester chooses to reveal character largely through action and daily experiences, it makes the moments when he does open up an inner life at a turning point all the more striking.</p> <p>He tells a good story. He gives you a lot to think about. This is an intelligent and entertaining account of our grubby, uncertain, fragmented London society that has almost replaced religion with shopping. Read it.</p> <p><em>Claire Tomalin's most recent book is </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780670917679/charles-dickens-a-life\" title=\"\"><em>Charles Dickens: A Life</em></a><em> (Viking)</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Later this week, Vince Cable, the business secretary, addresses the national manufacturing conference, a body asking questions pertinent not just to its own sector \u2013 worth 12% of GDP \u2013 but to the health of the nation as a whole. On growth, is the government strategy of deficit reduction the right one? And, on global competitiveness, how well placed is the UK to do business? One possible answer to both questions blows dust off an idea pushed to the back of the policy cupboard by a succession of governments. It has been boldly reclaimed recently by Mr Cable. Namely, the need for a coherent industrial strategy. In truth, as the Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang argues, the UK has had an industrial strategy for years but focused only on the financial sector, at a staggering cost. The need to rebalance the economy, and address what is the sharpest decline in manufacturing of any advanced economy over the past 30 years, grows in urgency by the day. As Mr Cable says, this will not happen with \"an uncritical belief in self-correcting markets\". Last week, David Cameron grilled his cabinet colleagues on how they will deliver growth. Ministers are scrambling to piece together fragments of a vision of how UK plc is going to foster innovation and generate jobs, products, and services. A vision that, as the TUC argues cogently, creates a \"new manufacturing ecosystem\" that also responds to the challenge of what the world will need in 2025. In the here and now, the news for ordinary men and women grows grimmer. On Friday, Mr Cable returned from a flying visit to New York to ask GM bosses to spare its Ellesmere Port plant. More than 2,000 jobs could be affected by closure, as well as a spider's web of suppliers. Last week, too, BAE Systems confirmed that 100 years of manufacturing at its factory in Yorkshire will end, meaning unemployment for hundreds. Bombardier in Derby cut 1,200 jobs last year after it failed to win the \u00a31.4bn Thameslink train contract. Now it waits to hear if it has successfully bid for the \u00a31bn Crossrail contract. Its loss could mean the death of train manufacturing in Britain. Last week, Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB, published a study that suggested a plan to strengthen the role of manufacturing while cutting the country's spiralling trade deficit on factory-made goods. The strategy includes tax breaks for research and development, a cut in corporation tax and the appointment, inevitably, of a \"manufacturing tsar\". \"My ideas are not radical,\" Sir Anthony explained. \"My feeling is that [in the economy as a whole] Britain is in a crisis and we're not doing enough about it.\" Mr Cable appears to concur. Last week, he committed what is apostasy to his \"small government\", deregulating Tory colleagues. He called for \"a proper industrial policy\". The Observer agrees. So what shape should it take? The government has launched a number of initiatives including a regional growth fund; the green investment bank (borrowing powers delayed until 2015) and targeted support, for instance, to advanced manufacturing (aerospace, life sciences, pharmaceuticals). However, given the colossal scale of the challenge, such measures are Lilliputian. A political aversion to a \"proper industrial policy\" has allowed other nations, among them Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Germany, to sprint ahead. The aversion is cross-party, rooted in the 1970s, when it became associated with \"picking winners\". In practice, that meant companies already terminal such as British Leyland. The free market ideology of Mrs Thatcher added further hammer blows. In the late 1990s, a prescient Peter Mandelson, as Labour's business secretary, endorsed \"industrial activism\" and, in a range of measures, moved policy on from \"mills and smokestacks\" to embrace the knowledge, science, innovation and technology sectors. In spite of this, as Will Hutton, the Observer's columnist, has written often, British companies continue to \"under-invest, under-innovate and under-compete\". In a stringent pamphlet, Chris Benjamin, formerly of the Department of Trade and Industry, says the UK \"lacks the sinews, networks and public perception of a genuine industrial society\". Some in the current government believe companies should be \"freed\" to find their own route to prosperity. Others make the trip to Germany. In the 1990s, that country was running on flat tyres with low growth and high unemployment, a mirror of the UK today. In 2009, it had a serious minus growth rate; a year later, it had turned this round. How had it been achieved? Cuts in benefits and a measure of deregulation helped but so too did its respect for deep institutional foundations such as Mittelstand, small to medium family firms that plan for the long term rather than the quick buck. Technical and vocational education is rated; a network of 428 German savings banks supports local businesses. In addition, KfW, a state investment bank, finances public infrastructure projects and cushions downturns. Labour is exploring a British version. Germany also has workers and union representation in company decision-making. The US, too, offers lessons. In the 1980s, for example, the semi-conductor industry was strengthened when 14 manufacturers collaborated with strong government support. Sematech now has 50% of the global market. A \"proper\" UK industrial strategy begins with an audit of the economy outside the Square Mile. We need to \"pick winners\" from infant industries, not those already in their death throes. Tax breaks? The Treasury awaits an inquiry into the ramifications of cutting the 50p tax. In Canada, the video games industry has games tax relief and in 2008 it workforce grew by 30%, while in the UK the sector declined by 10%. Caution is required on deregulation if it means reducing employee protection. A strategy requires a procurement policy (Crossrail?); banks that lend; investment in infrastructure, including the north (receiving, for instance, only 7.6% of the transport budget); and attention paid to the fact that 82,000 engineers, scientists and technicians are required over the next four years. Government activity on exports is vital. An overhaul of the finance sector is signalled by Professor John Kay's interim report suggesting, for instance, an end to quarterly reporting that puts the shareholder's dividend before long-term growth. Even before the recession, we were in trouble. The UK's share of world exports fell from 4.4% in 2000 to 2.8% in 2009. Politicians repeating the word \"growth\" will not summon up the genie. Nick Pierce of the thinktank IPPR says that recent weeks have seen \"a lot of throat clearing\" on the question of an industrial policy. Now it's time for government to find its voice.",

      "bodyText": "The FBI could only jail Al Capone for tax evasion. It would have preferred to have put him in the dock for racketeering and organising the St Valentine's Day massacre. But the cops had to settle for charging him with not paying taxes on the proceeds of crime rather than the crimes themselves. The punishment of Capone serves as a metaphor for the end of the good press Ken Livingstone has had from the \"liberal\" media. If there were a wider sense of honour on the British liberal-left, it would have turned on Livingstone for his alliances with the religious right long ago. It would have affirmed its belief in the emancipation of women and homosexual and racial equality and said it could not tolerate a politician who in 2004 embraced a cleric who endorsed the genital mutilation of girls, wife-beating and the murder of homosexuals, Israeli civilians and any Muslim who decided to change his or her religion. In 2010, Labour supporters would have demanded that the party expel Livingstone for backing a candidate whose supporters had links to the Islamic Forum of Europe in the contest to be mayor of Tower Hamlets rather than the official Labour contender. Although a few London Labour MPs and activists have proved that they mean what they say, most have preferred to cheer \"Ken\" on. (I don't call \"Ken\" and \"Boris\" by their first names, incidentally. I know them only slightly and we are not friends.) Only when the Telegraph revealed Livingstone's tax avoidance did the stagnant pond of \"progressive\" opinion stir. To be fair, those of us who did not need to be told that Livingstone was a hypocrite worthy of the pen of a Swift or Dickens were shocked, too, although, given his record, we had no right to be. When he was London's mayor, Livingstone never offended the City. In 2008, Alistair Darling, the then Labour chancellor, proposed a modest tax on foreign financiers, as did the Conservatives. Although the left regarded Darling as a rightwing square and Livingstone as a radical reb, the record shows that Livingstone worried that Darling was going too far and announced his opposition to George Osborne's piffling levy on non-doms. Since the crash, Livingstone has changed tack. He is now the champion of the suffering 99% and enemy of the despised 1%. \"Cameron's problem is too many of his team have become super-rich by exploiting every tax fiddle,\" he cried. \"No one should be allowed to vote in a British election, let alone sit in our parliament, unless they are paying their full share of tax.\" He was talking about himself. Livingstone and his wife are not a couple but a company \u2013 Silveta Ltd. He channels his money from media appearances and speeches into the firm rather than declaring it as personal income. The accounts for 2009/10 show he had almost \u00a3320,000 stored in Silveta in cash, after clearing \u00a3284,000 after tax and expenses \u2013 figures that put Livingstone comfortably in the 1%. With this deft manoeuvre, Livingstone could avoid the higher rate of income tax at 40% then (50% now) and instead pay corporation tax at 21% then (20% now). Unlike American candidates for public office, British politicians do not release their tax returns \u2013 it is well past time that they did. But every tax planner knows that a client who employs Livingstone's tactics can use his wife's tax allowances to boost income, divert funds into a pension and claim tax relief and set expenses against profits. The opportunities for creative accounting are many and lucrative. Unlike Capone's, Livingstone's tax arrangements are legal. But therein lies the scandal. The veteran tax justice campaigner Richard Murphy told me that the practice of individuals pretending that they were companies caused \"a massive leakage of tax revenue\" \u2013 made up by the poor saps who pay at the full rate. \"They have all the tax advantages of a company without the obligation to tell the world what they are doing, with the privilege society has granted them.\" The comparison with Capone holds in one respect, however. With the demagogue as with the gangster, the best question is not: \"What tax did you pay?\" but: \"How did you make your money?\" In Livingstone's case, part of his earnings came from Press TV, the state propaganda station for the Iranian dictatorship. You can almost justify appearing on the mouthpiece of a theocracy if you made a point of condemning its suppression of women and pro-democracy campaigners, or its imprisonment of trade union leaders, which would concern Livingstone if he were a true man of the left. Livingstone concentrated on attacking the west and Israel instead. There is much to attack. But you do not do it in the service of a regime that uses anti-western rhetoric and anti-semitic conspiracy theories to justify the denial of democracy to the subject peoples of Iran. What's more, you do not do it for money. Labour loyalists may say that they will vote for Livingstone because anyone is better than Johnson. They will stick by their party, come what may. Theirs is a simple rule, but notice how much they give away. In a democracy, the voters are meant to hold the politicians to account, not the other way round. Voters who say that they will support their party however shabbily its candidates behave renounce what slight power they possess. The party holds them to account. \"If you don't vote for us,\" it can say, \"you are a traitor by your own admission.\" A more principled stance would be to vote for Livingstone but do everything you can to mitigate the worst effects of a Labour victory: join the National Secular Society, which opposes divinely inspired bigotry in whatever form it comes; support the Muslims and ex-Muslims running the One Law for All campaign against sharia; and insist that there can be no negotiation or compromise on full equality for gays and women, whatever creed claims dominion over their minds and bodies. As for me, and for what it's worth, I've done all of the above and need to do more. I will vote for Labour assembly members, then Green, Lib Dem or something equally silly for mayor, and offer no second preference. If Johnson wins by one vote, I'll say that was Labour's fault for putting forward Livingstone, not mine. We own the politicians. They don't own us.",

But the cops had to settle for charging him with not paying taxes on the proceeds of crime rather than the crimes themselves.</p> <p>The punishment of Capone serves as a metaphor for the end of the good press Ken Livingstone has had from the \"liberal\" media. If there were a wider sense of honour on the British liberal-left, it would have turned on Livingstone for his alliances with the religious right long ago. <a href=\"http://www.galha.org/briefing/qaradawi.html\" title=\"\">It would have affirmed its belief in the emancipation of women and homosexual and racial equality and said it could not tolerate a politician who in 2004 embraced a cleric who endorsed the genital mutilation of girls, wife-beating and the murder of homosexuals, Israeli civilians and any Muslim who decided to change his or her religion</a>. I<a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-24035919-kens-friends-in-the-east.do\" title=\"\">n 2010, Labour supporters would have demanded that the party expel Livingstone for backing a candidate whose supporters had links to the Islamic Forum of Europe in the contest to be mayor of Tower Hamlets rather than the official Labour contender</a>.</p> <p>Although a few London Labour MPs and activists have proved that they mean what they say, most have preferred to cheer \"Ken\" on. (I don't call \"Ken\" and \"Boris\" by their first names, incidentally. I know them only slightly and we are not friends.) Only when the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/london-mayor-election/9105977/Ken-Livingstone-uses-loophole-to-save-50000-in-tax.html\" title=\"\"><em>Telegraph</em> revealed Livingstone's tax avoidance</a> did the stagnant pond of \"progressive\" opinion stir.</p> <p>To be fair, those of us who did not need to be told that Livingstone was a hypocrite worthy of the pen of a Swift or Dickens were shocked, too, although, given his record, we had no right to be. When he was London's mayor, Livingstone never offended the City. In 2008, Alistair Darling, the then Labour chancellor, proposed a modest tax on foreign financiers, as did the Conservatives. Although the left regarded Darling as a rightwing square and Livingstone as a radical reb, the record shows that Livingstone worried that Darling was going too far and announced his opposition to George Osborne's piffling levy on non-doms.</p> <p>Since the crash, Livingstone has changed tack.

      "bodyText": "Leading the crusade against global poverty in 2012 might seem a thankless task, as austerity-racked taxpayers in the west lose sympathy with needy foreigners and China bestrides Africa brandishing its chequebook. But Jeffrey Sachs, the US celebrity economist, has already put his hat in the ring for the soon-to-be-vacant post of president of the World Bank \u2013 and he's enthusiastic about the challenge. \"This is potentially a time of remarkable breakthroughs in development,\" he says. \"We're seeing so many demonstrations and so many success stories. There are clusters of knowhow and technology that are extremely powerful.\" As one example, he says new developments in healthcare mean that \"we are on the edge, if we manage and implement it properly, of a tremendous decline in infant, child and maternal mortality\". What's required, he says, is not expanding the World Bank's reach \u2013 its 9,000 employees already operate in more than 100 countries and it has lent more than $103bn since the financial crisis in 2008 \u2013 but narrowing its focus, rolling out new technologies and spreading development best practice. \"It's a nitty-gritty problem to go from the idea to the implementation, and that's where I really believe my 25 years of sleeves-rolled-up, directly engaged in on-the-ground problem-solving, will help.\" Long before the current incumbent, Robert Zoellick, announced last month that he would step down this summer, two names had been widely suggested as Washington's choice for his successor: the former treasury secretary Larry Summers and secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Development advocates are deeply sceptical about both: Summers will forever be tainted by his vocal support for financial deregulation when he was Bill Clinton's economic adviser, while Hillary Clinton is so closely associated with promoting US foreign policy \u2013 it is her day job, after all \u2013 that she might struggle to endear herself to China, India and the bank's other increasingly powerful middle-income shareholders. The job at the top of the Washington-based bank has long been handed to an American, under a stitch-up agreed at the postwar Bretton Woods conference which puts a European \u2013 currently Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde \u2013 at the top of the IMF. The \"Brics\" countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 have declared that they would like to see a more open process for the bank job this time, but they may struggle to unite around a non-American candidate. Sachs, clearly not someone who struggles with self-doubt, says he has been overwhelmed by calls from heads of state welcoming his candidacy. He feels that it is America he'll need to convince if he is to get the job. \"I'm not a Washington insider. I'm working closely with governments all over the world. That's what I have been doing for 25 years.\" He's never been a run-of-the-mill, ivory tower academic. Along with Nobel prizewinners Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, he is one of the few economists who have built careers in the US as public intellectuals as well as professors, wading into political debate, in Sachs's case often to remind the insular US about the importance of the world outside. Time magazine has called him \"the world's best-known economist\". He is based at Columbia University's Earth Institute and acts as an adviser to the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, on how to achieve the millennium development goals, which set the world targets on poverty, education and health. But Sachs's role in development hasn't always been uncontentious. As a consultant in the late 1980s and early 1990s while an academic at Harvard, he advised Poland, then Russia, on their economic reforms. The strategy adopted by the Kremlin, under the tutelage of the IMF and the US treasury, involved a headlong dash towards privatisation and liberalisation that became known as \"shock therapy\". The consequences were disastrous, enriching a tiny coterie of oligarchs who bought up public assets on the cheap, and driving Russia towards defaulting on its debts. However, Sachs now disowns the extreme policies for which many have since blamed him. \"People who really know me know that I have always believed from the first days of my work as an economist in a middle path, and a moderate course of how economies should work.\" Today, he says his recipe for beating severe poverty is not to go around world capitals with a begging bowl, asking for a bigger budget, but to make existing resources work harder. \"I don't think the bank is achieving its potential. It's spread over so many things right now, and it isn't mobilising the kinds of partnerships that I think would make a definitive difference to achieving the millennium development goals.\" He makes no bones about the fact that many of the \"partnerships\" he has in mind would be with multinational companies. \"I think the private sector is obviously essential for success on so many grounds,\" he says. \"These companies know what they're doing. They're the most global actors in the world; they're often operating in more than 100 countries and they hold the technologies that are the key to development \u2013 with information technology, with broadband, with healthcare, with agriculture, with infrastructure.\" Private sector involvement in development has become increasingly common, but remains highly controversial. Campaigners fear that the firms involved are more interested in marketing spin than saving the world, and fret that their involvement only increases the costs of development. But Sachs insists: \"You can work with these companies in a way that says, 'this isn't where our profit motive is right now', but where they make their technology available, and the public sector helps to diffuse it.\" Above all, he's realistic about the limits of compassion in the west. \"I'm not seeking this job with the idea of making an appeal for massive increases in foreign aid: it's not going to happen.\"",

      "bodyText": "Under the railway arches of Southwark Playhouse, bare brickwork gives off a damp pong and the dusky tunnels burrow far back. The place is full of shadows and secret crannies. Sound reverberates. Here you are only an echo away from the warren of caves in Kentucky down which a young spelunker went in 1925, hoping to open new caverns as tourist attractions. Trapped by a falling rock, he languished underground. Men went down to take him things to eat but couldn't go on and left bundles of food in niches. A reporter got to him, took down his story and ferried it to those above. As plans were laid to pull Collins out with a harness or to sink a shaft, newspaper men and radio journalists gathered, souvenir stalls were set up and his story spread across America. This is the tale \u2013 without a happy ending \u2013 on which Billy Wilder's 1951 movie Ace in the Hole was based, and which gave rise to a jauntily admonitory song in 1925 advising the young to \"get right with your Maker before it's too late\". It has given rise to one of the most haunting of late 20th-century musical works. I have waited for 13 years \u2013 ever since the Bridewell gave Adam Guettel's musical its British premiere \u2013 for a revival of Floyd Collins. I've written to theatres begging them to put it on, pleaded with Radio 3 to give it an airing, plugged its merits in this column. To no avail. But now the enterprising Southwark Playhouse has given Floyd Collins a magnificent production. Derek Bond's staging illuminates the glory of Guettel's score and lyrics and Tina Landau's book; it also suggests its flaws. The opening is a marvellous shock: a bluegrass number on a single guitar which speaks of hollows and creeks and a land where you can get lost. There is no big swell of sound, only a melancholy simplicity that is rare in musical land. Later come other unfamiliar notes: long yodellings and echoes, enhanced by the Southwark arches. The onstage band, which includes, alongside cello and fiddle and keyboard, 10 different kinds of harmonica, exults in one of the show's most lyrical moments \u2013 the sweet but ironical \"Lucky\". It rises to a wonderful though understaged reporters' chorus. It embraces the music that has influenced Guettel \u2013 who is the grandson of Richard Rodgers and whose style has been described as a mixture of Stravinsky, Sondheim and Stevie Wonder. The music is part of its ambition. The subject \u2013 challengingly bleak and static for a musical (poor Floyd only gets to move in his dreams) \u2013 is another, reaching with underground imagery and above-ground satire into more than one world. This is not flawless: the words are sometimes indistinct and hard to follow, and the piece is a quarter of an hour too long \u2013 Adam Guettel can yowl. Yet it is magnificent. Could it be even more so? Though Guettel called for a minimalist design, I am inclined to think that someone should ignore the advice and evoke the splendour of Collins's Sand Cave and the Crystal Cave with its gypsum flowers. Meanwhile terrible shadows and misleading bars of light are menacing; characters come out of them like creatures in a dream. And it's hard to think of a better cast than this one. Glenn Carter's Floyd is full-throated but not indulgent; Ryan Sampson as the whippet-thin reporter who squeezes through the tunnels to take down the story has the whippet-thin, grinning amazement of someone who has stumbled on a \"mother-lode scoop\". Robyn North proves herself a wonderful talent as Floyd's wounded, intuitive sister: she wheels around like a bat in a cave; she looks awkward and sexually abundant; she sings like a lark. Luke Norris's first professionally produced play gets this year's Young Writers festival at the Royal Court off to a strong, surprising start. Norris, who is 26 and an actor, has written about love in old age \u2013 and in doing so created a weird coincidence or highlighted a trick of the zeitgeist: his is the second play within a month at the Court to feature a man laid out in a hospital bed in Essex. In Goodbye to All That, a long-married, golf-playing granddad keeps bunking off from the bunker for a bunk-up. Or so it seems, but it turns out that this is not a dotty sexual escapade, but a love for which the 70-year-old is prepared to turn away from his old life. The play is intriguing for the premise alone, but Norris has made it into a nimble study of long-lasting disappointment and new hope in which blame and compassion are not stacked up in quite the familiar fashion. As the other woman, the finely ambiguous Linda Marlowe has such a sharp way with a scarf and the NHS that you suspect her of feline hard-heartedness: you'd be wrong. As the wife, marvellous Susan Brown is fierce and faultless: seized up with angry proprietorialness but not finally dismayed. Simon Godwin's production \u2013 in which those not in a scene are visible at the sides of the stage, putting pressure on the action \u2013 is tight and detailed, and Alexander Cobb and Roger Sloman play grandson and grandfather with the sullen ease of true relatives. There is one plot wobble in Goodbye to All That, but it doesn't destroy the certainty that here is a playwright to celebrate. Agyness Deyn makes a nonchalant stage debut in The Leisure Society. As a truthful, disengaged, sexually breezy and totally disruptive young woman, she saunters silkily around making a raised eyebrow do the work of a host of cartwheeling arms. She is in good company. John Schwab plays an insensitive stud with swagger. Ed Stoppard, a hubby so anxious about getting on that he worries when his wife has to take a morning off to have an abortion, is the essence of twitch. Melanie Gray \u2013 think Monica in Friends \u2013 is beautifully assured as the wife who wants to get drunk and laid and is held back by a notion of marital perfection. What a pity that they're performing in so calculating, so Yasmina Reza-inflected a comedy. Fran\u00e7ois Archambault's play is neatly but archly directed by Harry Burton, with plinkety-plonk music headlining irony. It has some cute opening jokes \u2013 here is a couple who want to adopt a Chinese infant to ensure they have a piano-playing kid \u2013 and some enjoyable sexual skirmishes. But this is a quartet who hardly need satirising.",

      "body": "<p>Under the railway arches of Southwark Playhouse, bare brickwork gives off a damp pong and the dusky tunnels burrow far back. The place is full of shadows and secret crannies. Sound reverberates. Here you are only an echo away from the warren of caves in Kentucky down which a young spelunker went in 1925, hoping to open&#xa0;new caverns as tourist&#xa0;attractions. Trapped by a falling rock, he languished underground. Men&#xa0;went down to take him things to eat but couldn't go on and left bundles of food in niches. A reporter got to him,&#xa0;took down his story and ferried it to those above.</p> <p>As plans were laid to pull Collins out with a harness or to sink a shaft, newspaper men and radio journalists gathered, souvenir stalls were set up and his story spread across America. This is the tale \u2013 without a happy ending \u2013 on which Billy Wilder's 1951 movie <em>Ace in the Hole</em> was based, and which gave rise to a jauntily admonitory song in 1925 advising the young to \"get right with your Maker before it's too late\". It has given rise to one of the most haunting of late 20th-century musical works.</p> <p>I have waited for 13 years \u2013 ever since the Bridewell gave Adam Guettel's musical its British premiere \u2013 for a revival of <a href=\"http://southwarkplayhouse.co.uk/the-vault/floyd-collins/\" title=\"\"><strong>Floyd Collins</strong></a>. I've written to theatres begging them to put it on, pleaded with Radio 3 to give it an airing, plugged its merits in this column. To no avail. But now the enterprising Southwark Playhouse has given <em>Floyd Collins </em>a magnificent production. Derek Bond's staging illuminates the glory of Guettel's score and lyrics and Tina Landau's book; it also suggests its flaws.</p> <p>The opening is a marvellous shock: a bluegrass number on a single guitar which speaks of hollows and creeks and a land where you can get lost. There is no big swell of sound, only a melancholy simplicity that is rare in musical land. Later come other unfamiliar notes: long yodellings and echoes, enhanced by the Southwark arches. The onstage band, which includes, alongside cello and fiddle and keyboard, 10 different kinds of harmonica, exults in one of the show's most lyrical moments \u2013 the sweet but ironical \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxU2FG_clew\" title=\"\">Lucky</a>\". It rises to a wonderful though understaged reporters' chorus. It embraces the music that has influenced Guettel \u2013 who is the grandson of Richard Rodgers and whose style has been described as a mixture of Stravinsky, Sondheim and Stevie Wonder.</p> <p>The music is part of its ambition. The subject \u2013 challengingly bleak and static for a musical (poor Floyd only gets to move in his dreams) \u2013 is another, reaching with underground imagery and above-ground satire into more than one world.</p> <p>This is not flawless: the words are sometimes indistinct and hard to follow, and the piece is a quarter of an hour too long \u2013 Adam Guettel can yowl. Yet it is magnificent. Could it be even more so? Though Guettel called for a minimalist design, I am inclined to think that someone should ignore the advice and evoke the splendour of Collins's Sand Cave and the Crystal Cave with its gypsum flowers. Meanwhile terrible shadows and misleading bars of light are menacing; characters come out of them like creatures in a dream. And it's hard to think of a better cast than this one. Glenn Carter's Floyd is full-throated but not indulgent; Ryan Sampson as the whippet-thin reporter who squeezes through the tunnels to take down the story has the whippet-thin, grinning amazement of someone who has stumbled on a \"mother-lode scoop\". Robyn North proves herself a wonderful talent as Floyd's wounded, intuitive sister: she wheels around like a bat in a cave; she looks awkward and sexually abundant; she sings like a lark.</p> <p>Luke Norris's first professionally produced play gets this year's <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/season/young-writers-festival-2012\" title=\"\">Young Writers festival </a>at the Royal Court off to a strong, surprising start.

      "bodyText": "Oil prices closed at $123 a barrel on Friday, and the cost of petrol on Britain's forecourts jumped to a record high. It was hardly the backdrop Europe's politicians had hoped for as they gathered in Brussels to rubber-stamp their new tax and spending rules (while stressing that growth, not austerity, is their priority). Just when policymakers and businesses were daring to believe that growth was returning, after the eurozone crisis hammered confidence at the end of 2011, they've got a different and more viscous enemy to worry about. As Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC put it, \"oil is the new Greece\". Even the most pessimistic commentators think the combination of the European Central Bank's long-term repo operation, and the \u20ac130bn bailout for Athens \u2013 albeit with half the money held back for the moment \u2013 has bought the eurozone some valuable time. The extra \u20ac1 trillion of three-year loans sloshing around from the ECB's two interventions, in December and last week, has helped to avert the possibility of a full-blown credit crunch or a domino run of bank collapses for the time being. And the new loan to Athens will enable it to pay its bills for a while \u2013 though few believe that Greeks will ultimately put up with the penury to which they are being subjected. But even as the flood of bad news from the eurozone abates for the time being, the crippling cost of commodities could choke off the recovery in Europe before it begins. HSBC's King points out that early in 2011, there was an optimistic mood abroad and forecasters were pencilling in a healthy year's growth. Yet this renewed confidence, plus the cheap money that was the legacy of quantitative easing (QE) on both sides of the Atlantic, helped push up the cost of commodities such as oil and metals. Even before the euro crisis reached its most dangerous phase last summer, these high commodity prices were depressing demand in the developed world \u2013 including from cash-strapped British families \u2013 and prompting the authorities in China, India and other emerging economies to tighten monetary policy to control inflation. There are reasons to fear that oil prices could continue to rise this year, too: political tension in the Middle East over Iran's purported nuclear ambitions has already led to increasingly tight sanctions on a key exporter of crude. Iran, for its part, has threatened to retaliate by shutting off the crucial supply route of the Strait of Hormuz. At the same time, some of the new wave of cheap money from the latest round of QE by the Bank, plus the ECB's repo operation, is likely to flow into commodities \u2013 after all, part of the way QE is meant to work is by pushing up the price of \"other assets\". And thirdly, as King points out, there is a longer-term trend towards higher prices, as the balance of global growth shifts over time towards more energy-hungry emerging markets. And high oil prices are exactly what the fragile economic recovery doesn't need. In the short term, they feed straight through to high inflation, giving central banks a headache; but the west's debt-burdened consumers are unlikely to be able to stomach those prices for long. So in the longer term, costlier energy will bear down on demand, knock confidence and hammer growth. Germany led the eurozone into a downturn in the final quarter of 2011, and GDP contracted in the UK too, but there had been hopes more recently that the worst was over. But if the upward pressures on the oil price continues, Europe's strategy for economic recovery, such as it is, and George Osborne's hopes that the UK will scrape clear of a double-dip, may soon be consumed by an oil slick. Questions for Barclays The heat over two of the Barclays tax avoidance wheezes \u2013 \"highly abusive\" schemes, according to the government \u2013 seems to have died down in no time. Indeed, a large slice of commentary has been preoccupied by the notion that changing the law retrospectively, which the government is doing in one case, sets a poor precedent. How are companies meant to plan for the future, it is asked, if tax laws can be changed on the hoof? What nonsense. The retrospective change in this case is terribly modest \u2013 three months. What's more, the government has a firm basis on which to act: it didn't think a bank that had signed the code of practice on tax avoidance would even dare to implement such a scheme. As David Gauke's ministerial statement put it: \"The government is clear that this not a transaction that a bank that has adopted the code should be undertaking.\" Indeed, imagine if the government had not acted. Barclays would have an unfair advantage over Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, the partially state-owned banks that know they must err on the side of caution in their tax planning. Remember, however, that Barclays itself has pledged to play straight on tax. Chief executive Bob Diamond makes speeches about the bank's supposed role as a good citizen. What went wrong? The bank's explanations \u2013 that the tax treatment was legal, it took professional advice and approached HM Revenue &amp; Customs in \"a spirit of full transparency\" \u2013 leave questions unanswered. For example: did Diamond and other members of the Barclays board approve the treatment that the government regards as a shocking breach of the code? If not, what steps have been taken to ensure that the same thing doesn't happen again? After all, Barclays's own statement on corporate conduct and ethics makes an explicit reference to internal controls \u2013 \"a reputation for integrity, both in our business behaviour and in our management systems, is crucial to the attainment of our commercial goals and to the fulfilment of our corporate responsibilities\". In the spirit of full transparency, Barclays should give a fuller account. Its shareholders should turn the heat back up. Can you feel the force? Dixons has been a dog in recent years \u2013 the shares collapsing from around 160p three years ago to about 15p today. It has been battered by online rivals, price competition and dire investments in Greece and Italy. It also has a tricky \u00a3160m bond repayment looming this autumn and has just lost its highly regarded chief executive, John Browett \u2013 under whose leadership the retailer has all but lost its reputation for dreadful customer service. He is off to Apple to run its global store chain. The fear was that Dixons might now lose its recent momentum. But retail analyst Philip Dorgan \u2013 who only a couple of months ago was reminding Dixons investors that 90% of companies that lose 90% of their value do not survive \u2013 now reckons Dixons will be able to repay the bond and can increase profits by \u00a3100m by 2015 (it is expected to turn in about \u00a365m this year). It's not a no-brainer \u2013 \"not for the faint\u2011hearted\", Dorgan says \u2013 but is not a bad bet.",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes, the tiniest newspaper story is a window on something vast. Like the chimney in Mary Poppins: if you creep into the little aperture, it leads to a huge secret world. A story I read last week, headlined \"Black women 'more confident in their bodies'\", was just a few paragraphs long. I only noticed it because it was illustrated with a photo of Michelle Obama in a rather fabulous little pencil skirt and cardigan \u2013 just my cup of sartorial tea. The brief attendant story reported that a survey (commissioned by the Washington Post) had found black women have more self-esteem than white women \u2013 \"even\", breathed the paper in amazement, \"if they weigh more\". What? No! Even if they weigh more? There are women whose confidence isn't tied directly to other people's opinions of their arses? Can this be possible? Next week: Lord Lucan found on unicorn farm, surrounded by people who think the postal service has improved over the last decade. In the survey, 67% of \"overweight\" black women said they had high self-esteem, compared with only 41% of \"average-sized or thin\" white women. This raised an interesting and complex idea. People have long complained that women of colour are under-represented in the \"beauty\" industries. In TV advertising, on billboards, at fashion shows, in women's magazines, you just don't see them. They rarely play romantic leads in films, either; Octavia Spencer's best shot at glory was playing a maid. Hattie McDaniel must have been rolling her eyes in the grave. I don't think it's possible for me to give less of a toss about fashion (as anyone who's seen my clothes will readily agree), but even I feel a bit sad, as I flick impatiently through 19 pages of advertising at the front of a glossy magazine in the hope of finding an actual article before the dentist tells me he's ready, that all the girls are white. You see the odd black model and I use the term advisedly: there's an occasional fuss about some new Eritrean signing with a \"bizarre and compelling look\", but these fashion mags and catwalks otherwise offer an overwhelming array of towering white replicates, each sullen white glare indistinguishable from the next. I think we've reached general agreement (and when I say \"we\", I don't include creepy fashion designers with their ponytails and spangly trousers) that this is weird and wrong, that black women should be more visible in all media and especially the women's market. But now it turns out that, hidden from glossy scrutiny, black women have managed to not get screwed up. They like themselves! They don't feel fat! They're getting on with life and worrying about other things entirely! The bigotry in fashion, cosmetics, advertising, TV and Hollywood hasn't damaged black women, it's saved them! They'd be mad to keep campaigning for greater visibility in Vogue or light entertainment, now it's clear that absence has made a lovely free space for them to form their own healthy self-image. Let's be honest: white women are kidding themselves if they think they're represented in these media either. I share about as much genetic material with Julia Roberts or Heidi Klum as I do with a tree frog. But somehow, white women have been tricked into thinking that's how they should look, if they weren't such miserable failures \u2013 while black women, by the simple mechanism of being a different colour, have spotted the obvious and stayed sane. Crawling further up the chimney of what was basically an extended picture caption to a Michelle Obama photo, I googled the full original survey. Of black women, 68% said it's \"very important\" to have a successful career, and 62% that it's \"very important\" to have free time to pursue other interests \u2013 compared with 45% and 55% respectively of white women. So the white women care less about working and about stretching their minds in other ways, presumably because they're so damn busy trying to stay thin. Meanwhile, 52% of white women think it's \"very important\" to be in a romantic relationship, compared with only 44% of black women. Basically, black women seem to be about 300 miles further down the road of liberation than their paler sisters. This chimney was, like Bert the sweep's, truly \"a doorway to a place of enchantment\". Despite being more laissez faire about the whole work thing, 51% of white women said they experience stress \"frequently\", compared with only 40% of black women. If you (black, white or any other racial mix) aren't starting to get the message about this magic world where work and hobbies matter more than dieting and dating, then splash yourself with cold water, close that matchmaking website and read the figures again. It's not that the black women in the survey are ruthless individualists, pursuing professional glory and solo fun to the exclusion of all else; the other telling statistic is that 74% of them consider \"living a religious life\" to be important, compared with 57% of white respondents. Some might say that this figure alone explains their greater confidence, lower stress and different priorities. But the happier body image, at least, must have a lot to do with being ignored by (and thus disconnected from) the media mainstream and its impossible beauty ideals. Discovering that these black women seem to hold all the secrets to a happy and ambitious life, one's first instinct is to be even more furious about their under-representation. Let's get these good examples out there for us all to see! But it's a Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat problem: the figures suggest that, once everyone starts looking, the priorities change and the peace of mind is killed off entirely. This survey says more about the dangers of the media than anything that's come out of the Leveson inquiry. www.victoriacoren.com",

      "body": "<p>Sometimes, the tiniest newspaper story is a window on something vast. Like the chimney in <em>Mary Poppins</em>: if you creep into the little aperture, it leads to a huge secret world.</p> <p>A story I read last week, headlined \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/black-women-in-america/\" title=\"\">Black women 'more confident in their bodies'</a>\", was just a few paragraphs long. I only noticed it because it was illustrated with a photo of Michelle Obama in a rather fabulous little pencil skirt and cardigan \u2013 just my cup of sartorial tea.</p> <p>The brief attendant story reported that a survey (commissioned by the <em>Washington Post</em>) had found black women have more self-esteem than white women \u2013 \"even\", breathed the paper in amazement, \"if they weigh more\".</p> <p>What? No! <em>Even if they weigh more?</em> There are women whose confidence isn't tied directly to other people's opinions of their arses? Can this be possible? Next week: Lord Lucan found on unicorn farm, surrounded by people who think the postal service has improved over the last decade.</p> <p>In the survey, 67% of \"overweight\" black women said they had high self-esteem, compared with only 41% of \"average-sized or thin\" white women.</p> <p>This raised an interesting and complex idea. People have long complained that women of colour are under-represented in the \"beauty\" industries. In TV advertising, on billboards, at fashion shows, in women's magazines, you just don't see them. They rarely play romantic leads in films, either; Octavia Spencer's best shot at glory was playing a maid. Hattie McDaniel must have been rolling her eyes in the grave.</p> <p>I don't think it's possible for me to give less of a toss about fashion (as anyone who's seen my clothes will readily agree), but even I feel a bit sad, as I flick impatiently through 19 pages of advertising at the front of a glossy magazine in the hope of finding an actual article before the dentist tells me he's ready, that all the girls are white.</p> <p>You see the <em>odd </em>black model and I use the term advisedly: there's an occasional fuss about some new Eritrean signing with a \"bizarre and compelling look\", but these fashion mags and catwalks otherwise offer an overwhelming array of towering white replicates, each sullen white glare indistinguishable from the next.</p> <p>I think we've reached general agreement (and when I say \"we\", I don't include creepy fashion designers with their ponytails and spangly trousers) that this is weird and wrong, that black women should be more visible in all media and especially the women's market.</p> <p>But now it turns out that, hidden from glossy scrutiny, black women have managed to <em>not get screwed up</em>.

Don't think pints and packets of crisps. Think tens of thousands allegedly sprayed around in search of salacious sensation. Even phone hacking prospectively fades in this harsh, cold light. We're all \"victims\" now. The difficulty, of course, is that the ends on show here totally trump any means. Would a revised Press Authority, with hot and cold whistleblowers on call, have in any way prevented such alleged criminality? Do Lord Justice Leveson's broodings on statutory frameworks begin to touch the seriousness of emerging allegations? No: simply put, all this hints at criminality of a kind to make your hair stand on end \u2013 one to make MPs' expenses disappear in some bottom drawer. More, at this stage, it seems wholly title- and people-specific. Even News of the World people scratch their heads. Hacking? Yes. But Bun bungs? No way. If there was, as Akers believes the evidence suggests, a \"culture of illegal payments\", then it was six days a week on a single paper. But how far back do the allegations stretch \u2013 and how wide do they go? The police have only been looking at specific operators in a specific time frame so far. The trouble is, as you ringfence such apparent crookery, the relevance of Leveson falls away. His module two doesn't begin to stretch from, say, the News of the World to what might have happened at Piers Morgan's Mirror a decade ago. These are not \"general\" ailments afflicting what the BBC sweepingly calls \"the press\". These are particular, hugely damaging matters that, frankly, need investigating and settling before we get into bromide prescriptions. Leveson has always been back to front in a way. Any normal inquiry finds out what's gone wrong then comes up with remedies. But none of the real stars of the phone-hacking saga have come anywhere near LJL's courtroom (only their lawyers, hoping to find something exculpatory to plead by way of contempt). Now, as corruption claims burst into a new dimension, the mis-match becomes all the more manifest. What have Akers's networks got to do with \"the press\", as opposed to one small, grimy part of it? How can any legal inquiry propose ways of stopping something happening again \u2013 when we don't know what the something was? In logic, you'd let the law do its job while the inquiry took a break. In common sense, you'd stop the long and short term getting hopelessly tangled. But once juggernauts like Leveson start rolling, can anyone call a time-out? \u25a0 Three in an atrium is like three in bed. Who knows what curious couplings may emerge? And so it is as Geordie Greig, Evening Standard editor for three revered years, is whisked away by Lord Rothermere to edit the Mail on Sunday. Surely, the inevitable cry goes up, Geordie is now in prime place to succeed Paul Dacre? But look at the calendar before you reach too many conclusions. Both Dacre and Rothermere admire Greig's free Standard stint. He's mild and charming and brilliantly connected, the spirit of Kensington made flesh. But is that quite what's required at the Daily Mail? We know that the separate Sunday, honed by Peter Wright over 14 toiling years, couldn't play redtop successfully when the News of the World packed up. We may reasonably reckon, therefore, that Geordie's more upmarket skills can help it find a new direction. But does any of that work on the relentless, hard-driving daily? Greig is in his early 50s, no absolute spring chicken. When Dacre (64) goes, put your money on his deputy Jon Steafel or online wizard Martin Clarke. Both have five or more years to spare.

      "bodyText": "Dear Dr Mander My party keeps pestering me about the 50p top tax rate. They say it hurts all the rich people and go on about how we need to be nicer to the rich because otherwise they'll all go and live in Monaco. I'm rich too, you know. I feel the pain. I feel it in my very own wallet. (Smythson, before you ask \u2013 I can get you one on staff discount via my mate Dave's wife.) I'd love to cut taxes, especially for the rich. I'm a Tory chancellor \u2013 that's what it's all about. I just can't right now. I've told everyone: \"We're all in it together.\" I know, I know. But it was late and I'd had a couple of drinks and I wanted the electorate to come home with me. Now I'm committed. If I start cutting taxes for people who are loaded, the voters might dump me. But if I don't help out all my rich chums, they'll stop being Tory donors and my party will hate me. I've only got a few weeks before the budget. What do I do? George Osborne Dear Mr Osborne Your dilemma expresses a wider strategic problem for you and your party. To be popular, you recognise that you have to tap into public anger over the manifest economic injustice that flowed from the financial crisis \u2013 the City taking the spoils, ordinary people footing the bill. But your heart actually isn't in it. You want to be seen to be changing the system, but nothing in your political or intellectual background equips you to do it. Luckily, you can go a long way with populist gestures that dominate headlines but don't really change anything. You will get away with cutting the top rate of income tax as long as you arrange for the SAS to kill Fred Goodwin on the same day. Dear Dr Mander I put in many years of good public service in the police. It was hard work and when I retired I felt entitled to some reward. It's not unusual for ex-Met employees to do a bit of freelance stuff. I was proud to lend my expertise to Rebekah Brooks. She needed a ride; I've got the hooves. Win-win. And yes, I got to meet some interesting people. Rebekah had a pretty A-list social life. The prime minister might even have ridden me. To be honest, I don't remember \u2013 it was a crazy time! But now all of a sudden I'm being talked about like some piece of meat that just got passed around for a casual romp across the estate. It's demeaning. How do I rescue my reputation from the knacker's yard? Raisa Dear Raisa The standard practice under these circumstances is to sell your story. That way, your point of view comes across and you make a bit of money. The danger is that by playing the media game you open yourself to a world of tabloid intrusion. You need to be careful if there is any horseplay in your past that you don't want made public. The longer game would be to stay loyal to Rebekah and the PM. Peerages have been awarded for less and there is, in Caligula, a precedent for delusional leaders appointing trusted steeds to the legislature. Dear Dr Mander I'm flattered to have been asked to represent Britain at the Eurovision Song Contest, but I'm worried that I can't reverse the losing streak. We just don't have enough friends on the continent. Engelbert Humperdinck Dear Hump You'll be fine. And once you've sewn up the Vision, could you maybe get yourself across to Brussels and deal with our losing streak in EU treaty negotiations?

      "bodyText": "On last week's 10 O'Clock Live (Channel 4's comedy and current affairs programme), we decided to have a debate about Ed Miliband. It was a last resort, to be honest. There wasn't much news around other than all the slaughter in Syria, which is difficult to find a funny angle on. So we talked about Ed because he's supposed to be important. Miliband's job had been made particularly difficult that day by the publication of an interview with Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, in which the union chief appeared to advocate industrial action, and even civil disobedience, during the Olympics. As McCluskey or any of his advisers with a C or better in GCSE media studies will have expected, this called down a veritable shitstrike on the Labour leader's weird head. Before Miliband could even get to Twitter to issue a statesmanlike rebuttal of the general secretary's remarks, the government had already forcefully exhorted him to do so. \"I hope Ed Miliband will rein [McCluskey] in,\" said Nick Clegg. The problem here, I said on the show, is that Unite is Labour's biggest donor, so it's like Rudolph trying to rein in Santa. Nevertheless he tried, condemning McCluskey's remarks just like the government had told him to. But Cameron scented blood and called for Labour to \"start turning back the money\" that Unite provides. Obviously that can't happen \u2013 Labour utterly relies on it. But the request reminds everyone of the party's financially compromised position in relation to trade unions (something the political right somehow manages to portray as more embarrassing than their own reliance on business interests and expat plutocrats). Why did McCluskey do this? I wondered. At a time when he knows Miliband is struggling to come across as a credible alternative to Cameron, why would he knowingly give Labour's controversial relationship with the unions a leg-up the political agenda? Why invoke fears that a keenly anticipated sporting event might be spoiled? Surely that'll only make floating voters bob away? I can understand how striking during the Olympics might be effective but I can't see how airily speculating on the subject advances his cause. What was he thinking? I reckon I've worked it out. \"The idea the world should arrive in London and have these wonderful Olympic Games as though everything is nice and rosy in the garden is unthinkable,\" McCluskey said. I think I know where he's coming from. It reminds me of the Occupy camp outside St Paul's. The Occupy camp didn't appeal to me. It was a nasty mess outside a lovely building. The people involved seemed so far from composing any coherent expression of their grievances that one suspected coherence itself was what they opposed. Also, I don't like protests. I don't like marches and banners. I'm not saying they shouldn't happen, I hasten to add \u2013 they're noble and important and a vital expression of freedom. In fact, the only thing that would get me to go on a protest march would be to protest against a ban on protest marches. That would be awful. Largely because it would mean I'd have to go on a bloody protest march, and chant and sing and wave a banner and generally engage in a counter-cultural vibe. I know it's important but it all feels a bit vegetarian to me. \"Get a haircut and go to prison!\" I shout at the telly, before turning over from Top Gear to annoying footage of the scruffy protesters. Aesthetically, I'm much keener on bankers. And yet I was glad the camp was there. It was an unmissable physical manifestation of what's wrong with our financial system, our form of capitalism and our society. Like a boil, it was an ugly symptom of illness. And getting rid of it has only treated the symptom and deepened our denial of the disease. There's a lot wrong with Britain so it's appropriate for there to be smelly camps in posh places. Breaking them up is part of a pretence that \"everything is nice and rosy in the garden\". I don't think those frequenting the stock exchange should get to pretend any such thing until they're safely tucked up at home behind their electric gates. So it chimed with me when McCluskey implied that there's something hypocritical about tidying everything up for the Olympics, not going on strike, providing extra litter collections, papering over the cracks and crack-whores, and luring the homeless into a big warehouse full of cider. He thinks it's dishonest and I can understand why. I don't agree, though. I think the Olympics is like Christmas. It's a festival. It's an arbitrary period of celebration. I think it's not only OK, but actually important, to have occasions when we forget about our problems for a bit and focus on the parts of the garden that are rosy. There are always some and we can tackle all the bindweed another time. There's something faintly insane about living in denial of society's problems \u2013 clearing Occupy out of the City smacks of that. If we never address what's wrong with the world or our country, we give into delusion and madness. But we can be driven equally insane if we worry unremittingly about all those problems. We need to take breaks from our concerns to celebrate things: sport, Christmas, birthdays, weddings, being alive. There's nothing hypocritical about that. The Olympics is a chance for that kind of celebration and it shouldn't be disrupted or deferred except in times of absolute emergency. The second world war was an example of a time like that. Maybe McCluskey thinks the Cameron government's policies represent a comparable crisis. \"The attacks that are being launched on public-sector workers at the moment are so deep and ideological,\" he says. Maybe he thinks that the coalition regime is so damaging that to enjoy this year's Olympics is tantamount to continuing with Christmas dinner even though the house is on fire. He thinks ruining an Olympiad or undermining Labour's credibility is justified because desperate times call for desperate measures. But he's wrong. Times are hard but not desperate. Amid the fear and hardship of today's Britain we also, like a heartbroken teenager being told their pain is nothing unusual, have to face up to the microscopic unnoticeability of this current blip on the millennia-long graph of human suffering. Most people at most times have had it far worse. It's not a good enough excuse to spoil the party.",

Designer Bunny Christie has excelled herself with an artist's studio that has the same distrait eccentricity as its inhabitants \u2013 decorated with antlers, ladders, a barometer. Outside its long windows, summer storms punctuate the partying. Lindsay Duncan is hostess \u2013 although as Judith Bliss, self-absorbed ex-actress, she can't always be bothered to greet her guests. When she's not struggling to learn the names of flowers in her garden, she's occupied with testing her middle-aged powers as seductress. In frisky knee-length breeches, sunhat and quaint, buckled shoes, she is a delicious example of someone unable to consign herself to the wings. Duncan's performance matches her character's surname. The young Blisses are adorably ghastly. Phoebe Waller-Bridge's breathtaking Sorel has perfected a gauche angularity, intermittent mannishness and a toddler's baleful pout. Freddie Fox is splendid as sweet and surly Simon. Jeremy Northam's Richard, a diplomat, is a scream: fastidious and ever more agonised (even the stiffest of lips is likely to tremble in the Bliss household).

Kevin R McNally convinces as Judith's vain author/husband and Jenny Galloway's housekeeper, Clara, is a comic treasure. What this production exquisitely demonstrates is the self-sufficiency of the Bliss family: their guests are no more than passing victims.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Josef Fritzl affair and similar cases of horrendous incarceration revealed in its wake have now produced a sizable body of documentaries, feature films and fiction too, of which Michael is a minor, rather puzzling addition. The 40-year-old Austrian film-maker Markus Schleinzer, whose first feature film this is, has worked as a casting director on over 60 films, among them Michael Haneke's The Piano Teacher, Time of the Wolf and, most significantly, The White Ribbon, on which he coached the child actors. The eponymous Michael (Michael Fuith) is a 35-year-old minor official with an Austrian insurance company, who keeps the 10-year-old Wolfgang (David Rauchenberger) a prisoner in the soundproofed basement of his suburban home. Michael is a bespectacled, nondescript loner with a brother and sister both married with children. He largely keeps to himself, rejecting the advances of a female colleague, whom he physically throws out of his house when she intrudes. He does, however, join two male acquaintances for a skiing weekend in the Tyrol where he has clumsy sex with a woman his own age. Wolfgang, of whose background we learn nothing, is much like any other mildly rebellious pre-teenager, and Michael behaves in the manner of a testy, impatient parent. Twice Michael makes weirdly ambiguous sexual advances, but more typically, he buys a small Christmas tree and sings carols in front of it with Wolfgang. There are inevitably elements of suspense, a couple of shocks, and a sustained sweaty-palmed climax that could justify the film being advertised as a thriller. Indeed Michael is dramatically reminiscent of Robert Shaw's novel The Hiding Place, in the TV version of which Shaw and Sean Connery played British airmen, shot down over Germany and hidden in a cellar for six years after the second world war by a weird Nazi who treats them as pets. But mostly the picture is blank, a credible series of scenes that invite us to make of it what we will. Hannah Arendt's conjunction of banality and evil comes to mind, but this is not, I think, what Schleinzer is talking about. Khodorkovsky (117 mins, 12A) Directed by Cyril Tuschi; featuring Mikhail Khodorkovsky The Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, one of the chief beneficiaries of the carve-up of various state monopolies following the collapse of the Soviet Union, was the nation's greatest oil tycoon in 2003. Then he made two mistakes, one admirable, one foolish. First, he suggested that president Vladimir Putin's declared aim of bringing democracy to Russia would benefit from an effective opposition and made certain mild efforts to bring this about. Second, he failed to heed warnings to get out of the country and join his billions abroad. As a result he was brutally arrested when his private jet put down, appeared before a rigged court charged with income tax evasion and was sent to a remote corner of the Gulag, where he's likely to remain while Putin stays in charge. The German director Cyril Tuschi's sober documentary gives a lucid account of the events preceding and following the arrest, features frank, informative interviews (including one with Khodorkovsky after his second trial) and raises some important questions. The most significant issue concerns Khodorkovsky's decision to stay in Russia. Did he believe he could win a battle with the thuggish Putin, a politician as ruthless and unprincipled as Stalin? Or was he a man left so guilty by his depredations in the 1990s that, like a character out of Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, he was seeking some form of punishment and redemption? If Not Us, Who? (124 mins, 15) Directed by Andres Veiel; starring August Diehl, Lena Lauzemis, Alexander Fehling, Thomas Thieme An established German documentarian, Andreas Veiel comes to the much filmed Baader-Meinhof story by way of Bernward Vesper, son of a German poet with Nazi sympathies, and Gudrun Ensslin, daughter of a Protestant pastor who served in the Wehrmacht during the second world war. Both were brilliant students when they met at T\u00fcbingen in 1962, reacting in different ways to their fathers' past. As Veiel tells it, their relationship turned into an intellectual folie \u00e0 deux that, given the troubled Germany of the time, led almost inexorably to their role in creating the Red Army Faction. It's an intelligent, complex, persuasive film, shorter, less agitated and comprehensive than Uli Edel's The Baader Meinhof Complex (2008), but not so deeply felt or affecting as The German Sisters (1981), Margarethe von Trotta's fictionalised portrait of Gudrun Ensslin. Wanderlust (98 mins, 15) Directed by David Wain; starring Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd, Justin Theroux, Alan Alda With the western in decline and the musical pretty much moribund, the only new genre that has arrived in Hollywood to fill the gap is the Recessional, ie dramas and comedies reflecting anxieties about the current economic crisis and those suffering from its consequences. The latest, rather sorry example is Wanderlust in which a tiresome New York couple are forced to give up their expensive West Village apartment after he (Paul Rudd) loses his job when his hedge fund firm is closed down and she (Jennifer Aniston) can't sell her TV documentaries to PBS. Driving down to Atlanta to throw themselves on the mercy of his grotesque brother, a manufacturer of portable lavatories, the pair take a detour and find themselves spending the night at a commune in rural Georgia, founded back in 1971 by a now elderly hippie (Alan Alda in characteristically unattractive form). Initially the two city slickers are shocked by the presence of nudists, proponents of free love and prophets of anti-consumerism, and some unfunny fun of a traditional (circa 1950s) kind is had at their expense. But soon enough they're won over by these colourful eccentrics, and in turn they convert their hosts to the pleasures of capitalism. The film is a humourless embarrassment, the cliche situations and flat dialogue decorated but not embellished by the envelope-pushing obscenity traditionally associated with its producer Judd Apatow. Hunky Dory (110 mins, 15) Directed by Marc Evans; starring Minnie Driver, Aneurin Barnard, Danielle Branch, Haydn Gwynne, Robert Pugh Looking like a sexy hamster, Minnie Driver plays Viv (short for Vivienne, but suggestive of vivacious), a failed actress recently returned to teach drama at a comprehensive in her native south Wales. Her dedication and enthusiasm are an affront to virtually everyone else in the staff room but most especially the overweight sports master and the sour woman (Haydn Gwynne), and they're determined to undermine the ambitious rock-opera version of Shakespeare's The Tempest she's directing as the big end-of-term event. The pupils, a surly foul-mouthed crowd, are only mildly interested at first, as is the old-fashioned headmaster (Robert Pugh), and a predictable crisis ensues as Viv tries to keep the show on the road. The year is 1976, which means that unemployment wasn't as bad as it was later to become, though no one appears to be associated with coal-mining, and there's no need to bother about the weather as Britain was enjoying a famous heat wave. The movie isn't bad. Driver is an attractive presence, and it isn't her fault that at times she appears unbearably smug and self-righteous. But the producers would have been wise to have invited James Corden, Ruth Jones and Rob Brydon in to spend a couple of days polishing Laurence Coriat's screenplay. This Means War (94 mins, 12A) Directed by McG; starring Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, Tom Hardy McG is the nom de guerre of the 43-year-old music video director Joseph McGinty Nichol, who followed his witless big-screen debut, Charlie's Angels, with the turgid Terminator Salvation. Can his films get worse? Take my word for it, or expose yourself to this comedy thriller. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy star as intrepid CIA field agents who simultaneously court lonely heart Reese Witherspoon. They're disguised as respectively a travel agent and a cruise ship captain (now that's a truly dangerous cover story nowadays).",

      "bodyText": "We know that when Goering heard the word \"culture\", he would reach for his revolver. Graham Greene never liked to use the word, either, if he could help it. Yet, there it is: culture offers a universe of books, music, art, theatre, dance and film, a sublime liberation from the prison of the self. Culture, famously opposed to anarchy, offers a unique, private door, an exit, an escape route into a world elsewhere. The arts journalist is the correspondent from that alternative front line. Where some writers are herbivores or carnivores, hedgehogs or foxes, the arts journalist is an omnivore. In the English tradition, the great omnivores, from Dickens and Shaw to Peter Ackroyd and Will Self, have the kind of appetite for culture, in all its uplifting variety, that seems to push the world of the imagination to the limit and then some. Over many decades, the Observer has published the work of several critics who were also great arts journalists, including George Orwell, Kenneth Tynan and Clive James, but few were as remarkable as John Burgess Wilson, known to literature as Anthony Burgess, who died in 1993.This literary phenomenon, whom I remember wrapped in cigar smoke and unspooling a tireless conversation, was neither a hedgehog nor a fox, though he often had an acquiline, predatory air. He was a chameleon, a man of parts and unquenchably a man of letters. His identities ranged from Anonymous to \"Joseph Kell\" (first author of Inside Mr Enderby) to Anthony Burgess, author of A Clockwork Orange, the classic postwar dystopia that celebrates its 50th birthday this year. More than just a novelist, Burgess was also a composer, a playwright, a literary critic and a journalist. He began as a student, contributing poetry and stories to the Manchester University magazine, the Serpent. Conscripted and stationed in Gibraltar during the war, he also wrote a Sonata for Cello and Piano in G minor, his earliest musical composition (later, there would be operas and symphonies). Once he became a full-time writer in 1959, his career as an arts journalist and cultural commentator took wing with signed pieces in Country Life and the Listener and anonymous contributions to the TLS. Brave and indefatigable as a novelist, Burgess could be incorrigible as a critic. In 1963, he was sacked as fiction reviewer for the Yorkshire Post having contrived to review his alter ego Joseph Kell's novel Inside Mr Enderby with characteristic brio: \"This is a dirty book. It is full of bowel-blasts and flatulent borborygms, emetic meals and halitosis. It may well make some people sick, and those with tender stomachs are advised to let it alone.\" Within weeks of his disgrace, however, Burgess was writing for the Guardian and for my predecessor, Terence Kilmartin, on the Observer, \"my paper\", with whom he sustained a lifelong relationship. Among his \"discoveries\" as a reviewer we find Joseph Heller, Sylvia Plath (writing as Victoria Lucas) and Umberto Eco. Burgess's reviews in the Observer are a mirror to the man: compulsively readable, infuriating, omniscient, slightly bogus, sometimes libellous, allusive and omnivorous, ranging from cigars to dictionaries to adultery, which he memorably described as \"the most creative of sins\". His 1981 review of John Sutherland's monograph on Bestsellers is classic Burgess. Having opened by announcing, ex cathedra, that popular fiction is poor art, and that life is too short \"to bother with anything that is not the best of its kind\", he proceeds to declare a sneaking affection for the airport fiction of Robert Ludlum, Mario Puzo, Jack Higgins, Arthur Hailey and Ken Follett. Once deep into bestsellerdom, he reminds the reader that his own, recently published Earthly Powers has somehow, inexplicably, found its way on to bestseller lists, before making a swift, and brilliant analysis of bestseller DNA, concluding with a backward glance at A Clockwork Orange, and a pat on the back for Sutherland who he says, wittily, displays \"no whiff of Leavisite frivolity\". All in all, a perfect Sunday newspaper book review: entertaining, informative, provocative and wise, a door into that other world of culture. Burgess would be the first to argue that arts journalism should concern itself with every kind of creative expression, not just books. So it's appropriate that the international foundation that bears his name, in association with the Observer, the newspaper he most loved, should sponsor a new prize, for original journalism related to books, music, theatre, art and film. This competition will be for writing on brand new work in the arts, which has not previously been published, either in print or on the internet. The winning essay (up to 1,500 words) might take the form of an interview with or a profile of a writer, artist or musician, or a review of a book, film, concert, ballet or stage play. The winning entry will be announced in November 2012 and will be published in the Observer. Omnivores to your marks!",

      "body": "<p>We know that when Goering heard the word \"culture\", he would reach&#xa0;for his revolver. Graham Greene never liked to use the word, either, if he could help it. Yet, there it is: culture offers a universe of books, music, art, theatre, dance and film, a sublime liberation from the prison of the self. Culture, famously opposed to anarchy, offers a unique, private door, an exit, an escape route into a world elsewhere.</p> <p>The arts journalist is the correspondent from that alternative front line. Where some writers are herbivores or carnivores, hedgehogs or foxes, the arts journalist is an omnivore. In the English tradition, the great omnivores, from Dickens and Shaw to Peter Ackroyd and Will Self, have the kind of appetite for culture, in all its uplifting variety, that seems to&#xa0;push the world of the imagination to the limit and then some.</p> <p>Over many decades, the <em>Observer</em> has published the work of several critics who were also great arts journalists, including George Orwell, Kenneth Tynan and Clive James, but few were as remarkable as John Burgess Wilson, known to literature as Anthony Burgess, who died in 1993.This literary phenomenon, whom I remember wrapped in cigar smoke and unspooling a tireless conversation, was neither a hedgehog nor a fox, though he often had an acquiline, predatory air. He was a chameleon, a man of parts and unquenchably a man of letters. His identities ranged from Anonymous to \"Joseph Kell\" (first author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099541431\" title=\"\"><em>Inside Mr Enderby</em></a>) to Anthony Burgess, author of <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, the classic postwar dystopia that celebrates its 50th birthday this year.</p> <p>More than just a novelist, Burgess was also a composer, a playwright, a literary critic and a journalist. He began as a student, contributing poetry and stories to the Manchester University magazine, the <em>Serpent</em>. Conscripted and stationed in Gibraltar during the war, he also wrote a Sonata for Cello and Piano in G minor, his earliest musical composition (later, there would be operas and symphonies).</p> <p>Once he became a full-time writer in 1959, his career as an arts journalist and cultural commentator took wing with signed pieces in <em>Country Life</em> and the<em> Listener</em> and anonymous contributions to the <em>TLS</em>. Brave and indefatigable as a novelist, Burgess could be incorrigible as a critic. In 1963, he was sacked as fiction reviewer for the <em>Yorkshire Post</em> having contrived to review his alter ego Joseph Kell's novel <em>Inside Mr Enderby</em> with characteristic brio: \"This is a dirty book. It is full of bowel-blasts and flatulent borborygms, emetic meals and halitosis. It may well make some people sick, and those with tender stomachs are advised to let it alone.\"</p> <p>Within weeks of his disgrace, however, Burgess was writing for the <em>Guardian</em> and for my predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.clivejames.com/pieces/dreaming/kilmartin\" title=\"\">Terence Kilmartin</a>, on the <em>Observer</em>, \"my paper\", with whom he sustained a lifelong relationship. Among his \"discoveries\" as a reviewer we find Joseph Heller, Sylvia Plath (writing as Victoria Lucas) and Umberto Eco.</p> <p>Burgess's reviews in the <em>Observer </em>are a mirror to the man: compulsively readable, infuriating, omniscient, slightly bogus, sometimes libellous, allusive and omnivorous, ranging from cigars to dictionaries to adultery, which he memorably described as \"the most creative of sins\".</p> <p>His 1981 review of John Sutherland's monograph on <em>Bestsellers</em> is classic Burgess. Having opened by announcing, ex cathedra, that popular fiction is poor art, and that life is too short \"to bother with anything that is not the best of its kind\", he proceeds to declare a sneaking affection for the airport fiction of Robert Ludlum, Mario Puzo, Jack Higgins, Arthur Hailey and Ken Follett. Once deep into bestsellerdom, he reminds the reader that his own, recently published<em> Earthly Powers</em> has somehow, inexplicably, found its way on to bestseller lists, before making a swift, and brilliant analysis of bestseller DNA, concluding with a backward glance at <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, and a pat on the back for Sutherland who he says, wittily, displays \"no whiff of Leavisite frivolity\". All in all, a perfect Sunday newspaper book review: entertaining, informative, provocative and wise, a door into that other world of culture.</p> <p>Burgess would be the first to argue that arts journalism should concern itself with every kind of creative expression, not just books. So it's appropriate that the international foundation that bears his name, in association with the <em>Observer</em>, the newspaper he most loved, should sponsor a new prize, for original journalism related to books, music, theatre, art and film. This competition will be for writing on brand new work&#xa0;in the arts, which has not previously been published, either in print or on the internet. The winning essay (up to 1,500 words) might take the form of an interview with or a profile of a writer, artist or musician, or&#xa0;a review of a book, film, concert, ballet or stage play.</p> <p>The winning entry will be announced in November 2012 and will be published in the <em>Observer</em>. Omnivores to your marks!</p>",

Messrs Marr, Paxman, Maconie and Bryson have all sought and failed to find the \"soul\" of Britain, albeit with high degrees of insight and humour: what was another trawl going to reveal? But it's terrific. Mark Easton, home editor of BBC News, has given us the very opposite of what could have been a lazy rehash. With wisdom and skill and, crucially, access to authentic stories behind the political machinations of the past 20 years of public life, he has delivered 26 alphabetically-headed chapters \u2013 J is for justice, T is for toilet, G is for grass (a grand chapter, this) \u2013 that are all well-written and full of surprises.

The wit, when it comes, is tinder-dry; the writing may not be quite as fluid or laugh-out-loud as Bryson's, but whose is? And he gives us, along with some eye-popping insights into the cynicism of politicians and their spinners, and all those diligently mined studies from around the world, some delightful expositions on everything from the Easterlin paradox to why rustic Britain's historical geometry has abhorred straight lines.

How Judith, the 10-year-old heroine of Grace McCleen's fascinating debut novel, must have loved that story. Growing up with her father as part of a fundamentalist sect, Judith is the fervent one of the family, a girl for whom loss of faith is the worst thing of all, who loves to read the Bible aloud, go doorstepping to preach with her father, and sit at home to \u2013 solemnly and calmly \u2013 await the approaching Armageddon, when all non-believers will meet their end. It's the aftermath of this that fascinates Judith most, and in her bedroom she has created a miniature Land of Decoration, in homage to the land promised to the Israelites in her adored Word of God. Yes, she's fervent. But Judith's world is under threat. There's the school bully, Neil Lewis, whose attacks drive her to wish she could intervene in the divine order by changing things in her own miniature world, and about whom she has long talks with a particularly vengeful and far from benevolent God. Then her father makes the decision to continue working when the union at his factory goes on strike, and all manner of pestilence is unleashed upon them, and their life really does become one of hellish persecution. McCleen's debut has rightly been much anticipated, not least because the author grew up in a similarly fundamentalist environment and the authenticity of the experience is part of what makes the book \u2013 and its astonishing young heroine \u2013 so memorable. The conceit, too, of a little girl believing that the miniature world she has created has the power to change the world around her is a cute, clever one. And the scripture-inspired writing on imagination is beautiful: \"There are palaces in clouds, mountains in rock pools, highways in the dust at my feet and cities on the underside of leaves\". But more than that, this young writer has done a brave, bold thing, writing what is effectively a religious allegory set in the mid-80s Welsh valleys. The community she depicts truly has an end-of-the-world feel \u2013 it is aggressive and hostile, full of chaotic, deprived households, a nightmarish vision of strikes and riots and bullying. Like her biblical namesake, Judith does conquer her oppressors, but there is no sense of triumph the novel's final message is of religion's failure to offer real solace. Happily, one senses that Judith has the steeliness, the intelligence and the imagination to survive and thrive. Surprising, affecting, thoughtful and complex, McCleen's novel grows in power the more time you spend with it, and marks her out as a writer to watch.",

And the scripture-inspired writing on imagination is beautiful: \"There are palaces in clouds, mountains in rock pools, highways in the dust at my feet and cities on the underside of leaves\". But more than that, this young writer has done a brave, bold thing, writing what is effectively a religious allegory set in the mid-80s Welsh valleys. The community she depicts truly has an end-of-the-world feel \u2013 it is aggressive and hostile, full of chaotic, deprived households, a nightmarish vision of strikes and riots and bullying.</p> <p>Like her biblical namesake, Judith does conquer her oppressors, but there is no sense of triumph the novel's final message is of religion's failure to offer real solace. Happily, one senses that Judith has the steeliness, the intelligence and the imagination to survive and thrive. Surprising, affecting, thoughtful and complex, McCleen's novel grows in power the more time you spend with it, and marks her out as a writer to watch.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One evening \u2013 we are not given a date, but it must be the early 1960s \u2013 the great French philosopher, essayist, novelist and pioneer of feminism Simone de Beauvoir was, as so often, at the theatre. But this was a stranger night than most. On De Beauvoir's left sat her lifelong companion and erstwhile lover, the greatest philosopher of his generation and founder of existentialism, Jean-Paul Sartre. To her right was her current lover, the writer, former resistance fighter and film director Claude Lanzmann. And on stage: Lanzmann's sister \u00c9velyne, a foremost actress of the day, playing the lead role in Sartre's play Huis Clos. The evening had been contrived as a response to Sartre's recently conceived passion for \u00c9velyne; he was determined to become her lover, asked Lanzmann to organise the outing and, as of this night, \u2013 \"my sister was radiant, beautiful\", recalls Lanzmann \u2013 duly won her heart. It was yet another association of ideas and romance in the intellectual, cultural and creative foment that was the Parisian Latin Quarter during its golden age, which were also halcyon days of European philosophy and revolutionary politics. But of the leading protagonists in that intellectual cauldron, only one titanic figure remains, Claude Lanzmann, whose memoir is published in the UK this month. Lanzmann is a witness of his time. He is one of the few people still living who can testify at close range to the epic events by which the second half of the 20th century is defined and measured. During the second world war, he was a teenage guerrilla in the French resistance. In its aftermath, he was among the first western writers to probe communist East Germany, the USSR, Chairman Mao's China and even North Korea, where he fell in love. He lived and worked among that Left Bank, leftwing existentialist avant-garde around his close friend Sartre, and was for many years the lover, travelling companion and confidant of De Beauvoir. He accompanied fighters of the Algerian revolution in desert redoubts under bombardment by the French air force, befriended both its leaders and General de Gaulle, only to be tear-gassed on the streets of the Latin Quarter during the \u00e9v\u00e9nements of May 1968. He \"embedded\" himself (as we would say today) with the Israeli armed forces as deeply as is possible without actually joining the IDF, or Tsahal, as he calls them, by their Hebrew name. But most famously of all, Lanzmann researched, directed and conducted the searing interviews for what is arguably the greatest film of all time, and certainly the most ambitious: the nine-and-a-half hour \u2013 \"it could have been much longer\", he says \u2013 Shoah, which, more than any archive project, history book or attempt on film, remains the definitive and inimitable record for all time of the most appalling catastrophe in history. One could put it this way: there are memoirs of survivors themselves, by writers such as Primo Levi, Charlotte Delbo, Tadeusz Borowski or Jean Am\u00e9ry \u2013 and there is Shoah. Nothing else can claim the same authority or cogency. Now, Lanzmann has created a different kind of epic \u2013 a book, a memoir of his own, to record this remarkable life. \"Autobiography\" would be the wrong word, as its enigmatic title, The Patagonian Hare, suggests. It has no chronology, and is a meditation upon, rather than a narrative of, this life among lives. Often, books by great men or women read humbly \u2013 or at least modestly \u2013 but when you encounter them in the flesh, there can be an element of pomp, sometimes even arrogance. With Lanzmann, it is the opposite. His book is often bombastic: \"I became an able, fearless skiier, undaunted by sheer, even vertical slopes,\" he explains; De Beauvoir later \"expressed her astonishment at how I had penetrated the dark soul of this apparently model priest\", and on another occasion, she \"and Sartre were waiting for me in Capri, eager to see me, hungry for stories about my trip\" to North Korea. And yet, in person, Lanzmann is the model of decorum, greeting me at his central London hotel with the impeccable manners of the really great person, who does not need airs and graces. He is physically small, but with the pugnacious build of a quarterback. Lanzmann's narrative begins during his wartime childhood in occupied France: he describes to me in detail his assignment for the Maquis to collect suitcases of ammunition from a stranger arriving by train and his part in the ambush of a Nazi convoy as it emerged from a road tunnel in the Auvergne. But it builds towards its core, what he calls \"those days\" on the left bank of the Seine, along the boulevards St Michel and St Germain: \"It was a liberation of France, it was the end of Nazism; it was a strong moment, and we were ready for adventure, ready for anything, to create the next world.\" Lanzmann calls Sartre \"the sultan of Rue Bonaparte\", and his beloved De Beauvoir by her famous nickname, Castor. He confides playfully how he fixed his first date with her, asking if she would accompany him to a film; \"What film?\", the philosopher replied, jealous of her time. \"Any film!\" replied Lanzmann. After the ensuing night together, Lanzmann left for Israel, and returned to her after a flurry of letters exchanged and a terrible storm at sea, to find \u2013 he writes \u2013 \"Castor's eyes, her arms, her mouth, her hands moving over my body as though to recognise it, the long, slightly tremulous embrace of our reunion.\" But, he adds: \"It was not love at first sight, it had to be learned, and take its time.\" He says that \"the rapport between us was both intellectual and carnal\", and describes the usual \u2013 but very unusual \u2013 working day in Paris: he and De Beauvoir would rise together and write in each other's company during the morning, after which \"she lunched with Sartre, or with me, or someone else\". De Beauvoir would then \"spend her afternoons in Sartre's office, where she had her own desk. One evening was reserved for Sartre, the next for me; the nights we spent together. But we also often had dinner together, sometimes the three of us, on occasion with the rare friends, such as [the Swiss sculptor] Giacometti, of whom Sartre was particularly fond.\" The founder of existentialism was, says Lanzmann, \"magnificent, a philosophical genius \u2013 a truly great thinker, and when he started to think he was generous with what he was doing \u2013 he would share his ideas, want to discuss them. And every time you left a meeting or a conversation with Sartre, you felt this sense of being capable of doing anything, such was his special charisma.\" His \"usual gaiety and hyper-active optimism\" could sometimes sink into \"a chasm of meaninglessness, the obvious, irrefutable fact that 'man is a useless passion'. Existential angst, whatever Sartre may have said while showing off \u2026 was not merely a philosophical concept but a reality.\" The recollections \u2013 both in the book and in conversation \u2013 are more about travelling together than philosophising: to Spain, to Cuba, to the ancient Egyptian Sphinx and Giza, and an especially affectionate account of a drive to Athens, \"Sartre chirruping like a bird, somewhere between six and eight stopovers scheduled, as well as a number of 'specials' planned by Castor, who always insisted on deviating from the shortest route in her determination not to miss some wonder of nature or art\". I ask whether there was really as little jealousy in these intense but apparently fluid friendships and relationships as the book \u2013 along with very many other accounts of them \u2013 imply. \"Why should we have had any jealousy between us?\" Lanzmann retorts. \"When I started my love affair with Simone de Beauvoir, she had no sexual relationship at all with Sartre. They did not make love. That would have been unbearable for me \u2013 I could never share a woman I loved.\" The Patagonian Hare contains much about philosophers, of course, including those who taught Lanzmann, and hilarious anecdotes about his shoplifting of philosophical texts during student days. But he does not write a great deal in the book about actual philosophy, or his own views on existentialism \u2013 \"philosophically,\" he says in conversation, \"I am very close to Sartre.\" Lanzmann still edits Les Temps Modernes, the Parisian cultural review founded by Sartre in 1945, and adds this: \"There is this fashion nowadays to say that no one reads Sartre any more, but this is absolutely not true, and my next issue of Les Temps Modernes is entitled Les Lecteurs de Sartre [the readers of Sartre, a meditation on his friend's legacy].\" Lanzmann's book is written in a deeply satisfying style, as though he were unfolding his life as thoughts occurred to him over dinner. At one point, he laments the fate of his favourite cafe, the Royal, in which he would sit with De Beauvoir \u2013 [I frequented it myself as a youth, because she went there] on the corner of Boulevard St Germain and the Rue de Rennes. It closed to make way for the \"drugstore St Germain\" and in turn, says Lanzmann contemptuously, \"a boutique\". He similarly regrets the passing of Le Diva bookshop on the corner of Rue Bonaparte. So far as family, sex and intense personal relationships are concerned, Lanzmann bares himself entirely, both on the page and in conversation. His mother left and forever hated his father, he clarifies, because he tried to sodomise her on their wedding night. \"Among my people, there are still many women of her view,\" he explains, who \"refuse this 'animal coupling'\". There is a raw account of his sister's life and suicide in 1966. \u00c9velyne was deeply in love with the philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who left her \u2013 which Lanzmann could never forgive, until Deleuze took his own life almost 30 years later. \"When I started the book, I had no idea I would do this,\" he says, \"that I would write about such personal things. But the more I wrote, the more it became necessary not to avoid these things. The things I write about my mother and my sister are not things I expected to write. It was extremely difficult, especially my sister's suicide, but I decided I had to tell her life, and her death.\" And so: \"The book is a mix of these private things, set against these huge events. You never escape them, they are always present.\" Indeed they are, and there is one point in Lanzmann's book at which his tone changes markedly, cueing a passage in which he describes with an uncharacteristic awe and humility his relationship with the extraordinary Frantz Fanon, who was dying of leukaemia when Lanzmann met him. Fanon was a psychiatrist, revolutionary and existentialist philosopher from the French colony of Martinique whose treatises on black consciousness and race are arguably the finest ever written. Fanon aligned himself with the Algerian revolution and became the ambassador to Ghana for the provisional Algerian government. As a leading advocate of revolutionary violence, he is often tarnished by those who know no better as some kind of godfather of modern terrorism. \"That notion, which I have heard, is entirely false,\" spits Lanzmann angrily. \"He was deeply, in himself, against what we nowadays call terrorism. He was a very soft man, very tender. Much of his vision was mistaken, but there was so much in what he said, one was obliged to listen to him, to approve.\" Lanzmann was so enamoured of Fanon after their first meeting that he arranged for Sartre and De Beauvoir to meet him too \u2013 which they did, in Rome, for a rolling discourse lasting three days. \"And it was the same with Sartre, this effect \u2013 it is absolutely true, the fact that Sartre did no work of his own over three whole days \u2013 something I never saw, before or after.\" Fanon was dead by the time of the six-day war of 1967 and Israel's counter-offensive \u2013 and the seeds sown for so much ferocity since. One wonders how those conversations might have gone had Lanzmann and Fanon had them in that post-1967 world. But Lanzmann did have a major argument over the Middle East with Sartre \u2013 probably the only one between him and the great philosopher. Sartre \"refused point blank\" during a study visit to Israel to meet anyone in military uniform, leading to what Lanzmann called \"a drastically reduced view of the country\", which Sartre, he says, saw as practising \"consubstantial imperialism\" (Sartre would later endorse the murder of Israeli athletes taken hostage at the 1972 Munich Olympics by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine). I ask Lanzmann \u2013 a strong supporter of Israel and director of two important films on the Jewish state \u2013 whether one could regard this fracture with Sartre as equivalent to that between Sartre and the other great genius of existentialism \u2013 Albert Camus \u2013 over Algeria, whose independence Camus was always uncomfortable with. \"Of course not,\" replies Lanzmann. \"Sartre and I edited an edition of Les Temps Modernes together which gave over half of its pages to the Arab side, and just under half to the Israeli side; it starts with Maxime Rodinson [author of a groundbreaking book entitled Israel and the Arabs] attacking Israel.\" In his book, Lanzmann says he regretted leading off the issue with Rodinson's attack on Israel. Given how central these deliberations on Israel are to his book, life, and work in film, I ask whether Lanzmann believes that the singularity of the violence of the Holocaust allows him to forgive \u2013 or perhaps tolerate \u2013 violence in defence of Israel that he would not tolerate in another context. This is the inference from his film Tsahal, made with the IDF \u2013 to which he was granted full and unfettered access \u2013 and of an intriguing, brilliant point Lanzmann makes about soldiers who wear their hair long, as the IDF do, in contrast to the bullet-headed norm of any American, French, British or Russian squaddie. \"It is complex,\" Lanzmann says, and there is a pause. \"I don't want to go into policy, but there are so many victims who become killers. It's a question of life. Every young Israeli soldier knows that if he is caught during an ambush, he will be tortured and lynched. There was the case of the soldiers who lost their way \u2013 and Israel delivered 1,027 Palestinian prisoners to get back just one Israeli soldier. One has to think about the lack of equality in this exchange\u2026 There is a real integrity in this army. It is not only about the survival of Israel, it is the uniqueness of the fate of this country. And the fact that one does not see an end to this.\" \"Are you against Israel?\" asks Lanzmann as I write his answer. I reply that I am very interested in the work of Daniel Barenboim, in getting young Israeli and Palestinian musicians together to play orchestral music. \"Barenboim is against the state of Israel,\" says Lanzmann. And he urges: \"We should talk about the book\" \u2013 which, in a way, we are. Lanzmann has an extraordinary relationship with Germany. He was the first French writer to tour with relative freedom around the communist German Democratic Republic \u2013 \"I must have been crazy,\" he confides now \u2013 and he adores Berlin. \"The Germans have faced their past,\" he says. \"They do not try to escape it \u2013 some, of course, but most, no. The first time that Shoah was shown in Germany was at the Berlin film festival of 1986. The cinema was completely packed. The people were so intensely involved, they sometimes could not stand it. They'd go out and smoke a cigarette, but they returned. Young Germans came to me, wanting to speak about this past, to stare at this past; the discussions would last almost a full night.\" Which brings us to the matter of the greatest film of all time. \"Holocaust,\" says Lanzmann, \"is an improper word, an inappropriate word. It is an invention of the Americans and British. The appropriate word is Shoah [the Hebrew for catastrophe or calamity].\" To find the right word to describe those who survived the Nazi exterminations is the perennial difficulty of anyone trying to write on the subject. \"Victims\" is clearly wrong, since it both belittles and confuses them with those who perished; \"survivors\" is a passable word, but Lanzmann finds a better one: \"revenants\" \u2013 the returned, which in French can also mean ghosts. It is a term that recalls those terrifying lines from a poem by Lanzmann's compatriot, resistance fighter and Auschwitz survivor, Charlotte Delbo: \"And so I came back/ You did not know, did you/ That one can come back from there.\" Delbo also sets the language for further matters crucial to any discourse with revenants who survived the Holocaust: the associated issues of memory, and self-destruction. Between what Delbo calls memoire ordinaire \u2013 ordinary memory, which permits one to function \u2013 and memoire profonde \u2013 deep memory, which contains the truth of experience \u2013 is a skin, which, when cracked, \"gives back the contents\", as Delbo puts it, of deep memory, and their full, catastrophic force. How could Lanzmann, in this great work, talk to the revenants without cracking the skin between the memory that allows them to function, and that which contains what they know? \"It was extremely difficult,\" he says, illustrating his point with reference to a man he calls the Barber of Treblinka, a Jewish prisoner called Abraham Bomba, forced to cut the hair of women before they were sent to their deaths in the gas ovens, in accordance with the Nazis' grotesque preoccupation with the value of their victims' tresses. His book tells us the stories of how he found each member of his cast, and finding Bomba was a chase \u2013 across the Bronx, Pelham Parkway, Upstate New York and Israel. Once arranged, the interview is conducted in a barber's shop. \"How difficult it is,\" Lanzmann explains by way of understatement, \"to tell these things in front of a camera and a cinematic team. To relate what he went through, cutting the hair off naked women before they went to the gas chambers, with no possibility to tell them that they were about to die in a few minutes. \"I wanted him entirely to myself, first, to talk. Bomba had a wife who wanted to talk for him. So I took him to a little hut in the mountains in New York state which belonged to him, with no one but him and I. We spent two days there \u2013 no camera, no tape recorder, hardly a pen; I did not take notes. He understood that I was not only interested, but completely sincere, in my understanding of the Jewish pity of Shoah.\" There was also of course, the raw instinct that makes for great \u2013 as opposed to good, let alone mediocre \u2013 film-making: \"I had to know as much as I could before shooting anything, in order to help them talk in front of camera. The act of shooting is to create something in itself, that cannot be foreseen \u2013 and I could not foresee the moment when Bomba suddenly broke.\" It is a fearsome, indescribable moment, when the \"skin\" begins to crack before our eyes, between the face and voice of the barber, and what he knows \u2013 yet apparently not so; Bomba survived not only Treblinka, but the telling of Treblinka. \"In the beginning, he talked in a cold manner, as if it did not happen to him, but to someone else. I had to stop that, and bring him back to talking about what he did, to talk about himself. But one has to be on permanent alarm in such talk, as the tension grows, and we cannot be sure what will happen \u2013 this is not theatre, this is real.\" All the while, the reel rolls, and there is this question of judgment: \"I had to work with short rolls of film, which had to be reloaded every 11 minutes. I had five minutes left on the reel at one point, which is a lot in a way. But I decided to reload the film nonetheless, and I was right \u2013 Bomba broke into tears \u2013 and if I had not changed the roll, I'd have missed it.\" Lanzmann's epic is divided between survivors, witnesses and perpetrators. His accounts of tracing, locating and filming the SS and Nazi killers \u2013 usually with hidden cameras \u2013 make for some of the most exciting passages of the book. But of the revenants, he explains: \"From the Jews, I wanted to know everything. All these are people who 'worked' for the Nazis, in the Sonderkommando [groups of Jewish prisoners forced to perform tasks in the extermination]. \"They are not the normal deportees,\" says Lanzmann. \"They were workers in the last station of the destruction process.\" I tell Lanzmann that I have just completed a book about survival of the camps in the Bosnian war which the Auschwitz survivor Thomas Buergenthal, former chairman of the committee on conscience at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC had called \"an echo\" of the Shoah, helping me to establish a respectful but cogent language. Then Lanzmann says: \"I must tell you that my main theme is not survival. It is film about death and the extremity of death in the gas chambers.\" Of course. As the great historian of Holocaust memory, Lawrence Langer says, all testimony of the Shoah is charged with the fact that the narrative's main protagonists, the dead, cannot speak. \"Not one of them should have remained in order to testify,\" says Lanzmann softly. \"They were to die too. They succeeded in escaping their fate with an extraordinary mixture of courage, audacity and luck. But [in the film] they were not interested in talking about how they succeeded in escaping, how they survived. They were entirely conscious of the fact that they were the spokesmen for the dead.\" Silence fills the room in Pall Mall, for there is everything, but nothing, further to say. Why The Patagonian Hare? Hares make three appearances in the book. The first is its opening, a passage reproduced from The Golden Hare by Silvina Ocampo, in which a hare is being chased by hounds: \"Where are we headed?\" cried the hare, in a voice that quavered like a lightning flash. \"To the end of your life', howled the dogs.\" \"I know the whole story by heart,\" says Lanzmann. The second describes a moment in Patagonia, which Lanzmann takes as a cue for the affirmation of life itself. He is driving when \"a long-legged hare leapt like an arrow and hopped across the road in front of me. I had just seen a Patagonian hare, a magical animal. Now, all of Patagonia suddenly pierced my heart with the sure knowledge of our mutual existence.\" He wears a tie with a repeated design of hares jumping around it. \"I love them,\" he says. \"I respect them, and their nobility. They are very, very beautiful animals. So fast, and their speed is their means of survival; every time I meet a hare, I know I am safe for a long time.\" The third mention in the book is by far its most spine-chilling moment \u2013 at once utterly surreal and spectrally redemptive in the strangest way: \"If there is any truth to metempsychosis and if I were given the choice,\" he writes, \"I would unhesitatingly come back as a hare. In Shoah, there are two shots that are fleeting but crucial to me, [one is of] a hare, its fur the colour of the earth, sitting by the barbed wire fence at Birkenau extermination camp while a rare escapee from Auschwitz called Rudolf Vrba speaks. As Vrba continues, we see the animal flatten its back, hunker down and crawl under the barbed wire. He too escapes. There is no killing in Auschwitz-Birkenau now, not even of animals; all forms of hunting are forbidden. No one keeps count of the hares, but there are a lot of them and I would like to think that many of my people chose, as I would, to come back as hares.\" \"I watched it, that animal,\" says Lanzmann, his final remark before we bid farewell, \"arriving at the fence at Auschwitz, and burrowing its way under the wire, cunning and determined, knowing it had to leave that place...\" \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2012. The original referred to Alberto Giacometti as Italian. This has been corrected.",

He is physically small, but with the pugnacious build of a quarterback.</p> <p>Lanzmann's narrative begins during his wartime childhood in occupied France: he describes to me in detail his assignment for the Maquis to collect suitcases of ammunition from a stranger arriving by train and his part in the ambush of a Nazi convoy as it emerged from a road tunnel in the Auvergne. But it builds towards its core, what he calls \"<em>those days</em>\" on the left bank of the Seine, along the boulevards St Michel and St Germain: \"It was a liberation of France, it was the end of Nazism; it was a strong moment, and we were ready for adventure, ready for anything, to create the next world.\"</p> <p>Lanzmann calls Sartre \"the sultan of Rue Bonaparte\", and his beloved De Beauvoir by her famous nickname, Castor. He confides playfully how he fixed his first date with her, asking if she would accompany him to a film; \"What film?\", the philosopher replied, jealous of her time. \"Any film!\" replied Lanzmann. After the ensuing night together, Lanzmann left for Israel, and returned to her after a flurry of letters exchanged and a terrible storm at sea, to find \u2013 he writes \u2013 \"Castor's eyes, her arms, her mouth, her hands moving over my body as though to recognise it, the long, slightly tremulous embrace of our reunion.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-422219695\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/3/2/1330712102044/Lanzmann-left-with-Jean-P-001.jpg\" alt=\"Lanzmann, left, with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lanzmann, left, with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at a Paris restaurant in 1964. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, he adds: \"It was not love at first sight, it had to be learned, and take its time.\" He says that \"the rapport between us was both intellectual and carnal\", and describes the usual \u2013 but very unusual \u2013 working day in Paris: he and De Beauvoir would rise together and write in each other's company during the morning, after which \"she lunched with Sartre, or with me, or someone else\". De Beauvoir would then \"spend her afternoons in Sartre's office, where she had her own desk. One evening was reserved for Sartre, the next for me; the nights we spent together. But we also often had dinner together, sometimes the three of us, on occasion with the rare friends, such as [the Swiss sculptor] Giacometti, of whom Sartre was particularly fond.\"</p> <p>The founder of existentialism was, says Lanzmann, \"magnificent, a philosophical genius \u2013 a truly great thinker, and when he started to think he was generous with what he was doing \u2013 he would share his ideas, want to discuss them. And every time you left a meeting or a conversation with Sartre, you felt this sense of being capable of doing anything, such was his special charisma.\" His \"usual gaiety and hyper-active optimism\" could sometimes sink into \"a chasm of meaninglessness, the obvious, irrefutable fact that 'man is a useless passion'. Existential angst, whatever Sartre may have said while showing off \u2026 was not merely a philosophical concept but a reality.\"</p> <p>The recollections \u2013 both in the book and in conversation \u2013 are more about travelling together than philosophising: to Spain, to Cuba, to the ancient Egyptian Sphinx and Giza, and an especially affectionate account of a drive to Athens, \"Sartre chirruping like a bird, somewhere between six and eight stopovers scheduled, as well as a number of 'specials' planned by Castor, who always insisted on deviating from the shortest route in her determination not to miss some wonder of nature or art\".</p> <p>I ask whether there was really as little jealousy in these intense but apparently fluid friendships and relationships as the book \u2013 along with very many other accounts of them \u2013 imply. \"Why should we have had any jealousy between us?\" Lanzmann retorts. \"When I started my love affair with Simone de Beauvoir, she had no sexual relationship at all with Sartre. They did not make love. That would have been unbearable for me \u2013 I could never share a woman I loved.\"</p> <p><em>The Patagonian Hare</em> contains much about philosophers, of course, including those who taught Lanzmann, and hilarious anecdotes about his shoplifting of philosophical texts during student days. But he does not write a great deal in the book about actual philosophy, or his own views on existentialism \u2013 \"philosophically,\" he says in conversation, \"I am very close to Sartre.\" Lanzmann still edits <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>, the Parisian cultural review founded by Sartre in 1945, and adds this: \"There is this fashion nowadays to say that no one reads Sartre any more, but this is absolutely not true, and my next issue of <em>Les Temps Modernes</em> is entitled <em>Les Lecteurs de Sartre</em> [the readers of Sartre, a meditation on his friend's legacy].\"</p> <p>Lanzmann's book is written in a deeply satisfying style, as though he were unfolding his life as thoughts occurred to him over dinner. At one point, he laments the fate of his favourite cafe, the Royal, in which he would sit with De Beauvoir \u2013 [I frequented it myself as a youth, because she went there] on the corner of Boulevard St Germain and the Rue de Rennes. It closed to make way for the \"drugstore St Germain\" and in turn, says Lanzmann contemptuously, \"a boutique\". He similarly regrets the passing of Le Diva bookshop on the corner of Rue Bonaparte.</p> <p>So far as family, sex and intense personal relationships are concerned, Lanzmann bares himself entirely, both on the page and in conversation. His mother left and forever hated his father, he clarifies, because he tried to sodomise her on their wedding night. \"Among my people, there are still many women of her view,\" he explains, who \"refuse this 'animal coupling'\".</p> <p>There is a raw account of his sister's life and suicide in 1966. \u00c9velyne was deeply in love with the philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who left her \u2013 which Lanzmann could never forgive, until Deleuze took his own life almost 30 years later. \"When I started the book, I had no idea I would do this,\" he says, \"that I would write about such personal things. But the more I wrote, the more it became necessary not to avoid these things. The things I write about my mother and my sister are not things I expected to write. It was extremely difficult, especially my sister's suicide, but I decided I had to tell her life, and her death.\" And so: \"The book is a mix of these private things, set against these huge events. You never escape them, they are always present.\"</p> <p>Indeed they are, and there is one point in Lanzmann's book at which his tone changes markedly, cueing a passage in which he describes with an uncharacteristic awe and humility his relationship with the extraordinary Frantz Fanon, who was dying of leukaemia when Lanzmann met him.</p> <p>Fanon was a psychiatrist, revolutionary and existentialist philosopher from the French colony of Martinique whose treatises on black consciousness and race are arguably the finest ever written. Fanon aligned himself with the Algerian revolution and became the ambassador to Ghana for the provisional Algerian government. As a leading advocate of revolutionary violence, he is often tarnished by those who know no better as some kind of godfather of modern terrorism.</p> <p>\"That notion, which I have heard, is entirely false,\" spits Lanzmann angrily. \"He was deeply, in himself, against what we nowadays call terrorism. He was a very soft man, very tender. Much of his vision was mistaken, but there was so much in what he said, one was obliged to listen to him, to approve.\"</p> <p>Lanzmann was so enamoured of Fanon after their first meeting that he arranged for Sartre and De Beauvoir to meet him too \u2013 which they did, in Rome, for a rolling discourse lasting three days. \"And it was the same with Sartre, this effect \u2013 it is absolutely true, the fact that Sartre did no work of his own over three whole days \u2013 something I never saw, before or after.\"</p> <p>Fanon was dead by the time of the six-day war of 1967 and Israel's counter-offensive \u2013 and the seeds sown for so much ferocity since. One wonders how those conversations might have gone had Lanzmann and Fanon had them in that post-1967 world.</p> <p>But Lanzmann did have a major argument over the Middle East with Sartre \u2013 probably the only one between him and the great philosopher. Sartre \"refused point blank\" during a study visit to Israel to meet anyone in military uniform, leading to what Lanzmann called \"a drastically reduced view of the country\", which Sartre, he says, saw as practising \"consubstantial imperialism\" (Sartre would later endorse the murder of Israeli athletes taken hostage at the 1972 Munich Olympics by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine).</p> <p>I ask Lanzmann \u2013 a strong supporter of Israel and director of two important films on the Jewish state \u2013 whether one could regard this fracture with Sartre as equivalent to that between Sartre and the other great genius of existentialism \u2013 Albert Camus \u2013 over Algeria, whose independence Camus was always uncomfortable with. \"Of course not,\" replies Lanzmann. \"Sartre and I edited an edition of <em>Les Temps Modernes</em> together which gave over half of its pages to the Arab side, and just under half to the Israeli side; it starts with Maxime Rodinson [author of a groundbreaking book entitled <em>Israel and the Arabs</em>] attacking Israel.\"</p> <p>In his book, Lanzmann says he regretted leading off the issue with Rodinson's attack on Israel. Given how central these deliberations on Israel are to his book, life, and work in film, I ask whether Lanzmann believes that the singularity of the violence of the Holocaust allows him to forgive \u2013 or perhaps tolerate \u2013 violence in defence of Israel that he would not tolerate in another context. This is the inference from his film <em>Tsahal</em>, made with the IDF \u2013 to which he was granted full and unfettered access \u2013 and of an intriguing, brilliant point Lanzmann makes about soldiers who wear their hair long, as the IDF do, in contrast to the bullet-headed norm of any American, French, British or Russian squaddie.</p> <p>\"It is complex,\" Lanzmann says, and there is a pause. \"I don't want to go into policy, but there are so many victims who become killers. It's a question of life. Every young Israeli soldier knows that if he is caught during an ambush, he will be tortured and lynched. There was the case of the soldiers who lost their way \u2013 and Israel delivered 1,027 Palestinian prisoners to get back just one Israeli soldier. One has to think about the lack of equality in this exchange\u2026 There is a real integrity in this army. It is not only about the survival of Israel, it is the uniqueness of the fate of this country. And the fact that one does not see an end to this.\"</p> <p>\"Are you against Israel?\" asks Lanzmann as I write his answer. I reply that I am very interested in the work of Daniel Barenboim, in getting young Israeli and Palestinian musicians together to play orchestral music. \"Barenboim is against the state of Israel,\" says Lanzmann. And he urges: \"We should talk about the book\" \u2013 which, in a way, we are.</p> <p>Lanzmann has an extraordinary relationship with Germany. He was the first French writer to tour with relative freedom around the communist German Democratic Republic \u2013 \"I must have been crazy,\" he confides now \u2013 and he adores Berlin. \"The Germans have faced their past,\" he says. \"They do not try to escape it \u2013 some, of course, but most, no. The first time that <em>Shoah</em> was shown in Germany was at the Berlin film festival of 1986. The cinema was completely packed. The people were so intensely involved, they sometimes could not stand it. They'd go out and smoke a cigarette, but they returned. Young Germans came to me, wanting to speak about this past, to stare at this past; the discussions would last almost a full night.\"</p> <p>Which brings us to the matter of the greatest film of all time. \"Holocaust,\" says Lanzmann, \"is an improper word, an inappropriate word. It is an invention of the Americans and British. The appropriate word is Shoah [the Hebrew for catastrophe or calamity].\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BbGO3x6JkxQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BbGO3x6JkxQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>To find the right word to describe those who survived the Nazi exterminations is the perennial difficulty of anyone trying to write on the subject. \"Victims\" is clearly wrong, since it both belittles and confuses them with those who perished; \"survivors\" is a passable word, but Lanzmann finds a better one: \"revenants\" \u2013 the returned, which in French can also mean ghosts. It is a term that recalls those terrifying lines from a poem by Lanzmann's compatriot, resistance fighter and Auschwitz survivor, Charlotte Delbo: \"And so I came back/ You did not know, did you/ That one can come back from there.\"</p> <p>Delbo also sets the language for further matters crucial to any discourse with revenants who survived the Holocaust: the associated issues of memory, and self-destruction. Between what Delbo calls <em>memoire ordinaire</em> \u2013 ordinary memory, which permits one to function \u2013 and <em>memoire profonde</em> \u2013 deep memory, which contains the truth of experience \u2013 is a skin, which, when cracked, \"gives back the contents\", as Delbo puts it, of deep memory, and their full, catastrophic force. How could Lanzmann, in this great work, talk to the revenants without cracking the skin between the memory that allows them to function, and that which contains what they know?</p> <p>\"It was extremely difficult,\" he says, illustrating his point with reference to a man he calls the Barber of Treblinka, a Jewish prisoner called Abraham Bomba, forced to cut the hair of women before they were sent to their deaths in the gas ovens, in accordance with the Nazis' grotesque preoccupation with the value of their victims' tresses. His book tells us the stories of how he found each member of his cast, and finding Bomba was a chase \u2013 across the Bronx, Pelham Parkway, Upstate New York and Israel. Once arranged, the interview is conducted in a barber's shop. \"How difficult it is,\" Lanzmann explains by way of understatement, \"to tell these things in front of a camera and a cinematic team. To relate what he went through, cutting the hair off naked women before they went to the gas chambers, with no possibility to tell them that they were about to die in a few minutes.</p> <p>\"I wanted him entirely to myself, first, to talk. Bomba had a wife who wanted to talk for him. So I took him to a little hut in the mountains in New York state which belonged to him, with no one but him and I. We spent two days there \u2013 no camera, no tape recorder, hardly a pen; I did not take notes. He understood that I was not only interested, but completely sincere, in my understanding of the Jewish pity of Shoah.\"</p> <p>There was also of course, the raw instinct that makes for great \u2013 as opposed to good, let alone mediocre \u2013 film-making: \"I had to know as much as I could before shooting anything, in order to help them talk in front of camera. The act of shooting is to create something in itself, that cannot be foreseen \u2013 and I could not foresee the moment when Bomba suddenly broke.\" It is a fearsome, indescribable moment, when the \"skin\" begins to crack before our eyes, between the face and voice of the barber, and what he knows \u2013 yet apparently not so; Bomba survived not only Treblinka, but the telling of Treblinka.</p> <p>\"In the beginning, he talked in a cold manner, as if it did not happen to him, but to someone else. I had to stop that, and bring him back to talking about what he did, to talk about himself. But one has to be on permanent alarm in such talk, as the tension grows, and we cannot be sure what will happen \u2013 this is not theatre, this is real.\"</p> <p>All the while, the reel rolls, and there is this question of judgment: \"I had to work with short rolls of film, which had to be reloaded every 11 minutes. I had five minutes left on the reel at one point, which is a lot in a way. But I decided to reload the film nonetheless, and I was right \u2013 Bomba broke into tears \u2013 and if I had not changed the roll, I'd have missed it.\"</p> <p>Lanzmann's epic is divided between survivors, witnesses and perpetrators. His accounts of tracing, locating and filming the SS and Nazi killers \u2013 usually with hidden cameras \u2013 make for some of the most exciting passages of the book. But of the revenants, he explains: \"From the Jews, I wanted to know everything. All these are people who 'worked' for the Nazis, in the <em>Sonderkommando</em> [groups of Jewish prisoners forced to perform tasks in the extermination]. \"They are not the normal deportees,\" says Lanzmann. \"They were workers in the last station of the destruction process.\" I tell Lanzmann that I have just completed a book about survival of the camps in the Bosnian war which the Auschwitz survivor Thomas Buergenthal, former chairman of the committee on conscience at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC had called \"an echo\" of the Shoah, helping me to establish a respectful but cogent language.</p> <p>Then Lanzmann says: \"I must tell you that my main theme is not survival. It is film about death and the extremity of death in the gas chambers.\" Of course. As the great historian of Holocaust memory, Lawrence Langer says, all testimony of the Shoah is charged with the fact that the narrative's main protagonists, the dead, cannot speak.</p> <p>\"Not one of them should have remained in order to testify,\" says Lanzmann softly. \"They were to die too. They succeeded in escaping their fate with an extraordinary mixture of courage, audacity and luck. But [in the film] they were not interested in talking about how they succeeded in escaping, how they survived. They were entirely conscious of the fact that they were the spokesmen for the dead.\"</p> <p>Silence fills the room in Pall Mall, for there is everything, but nothing, further to say.</p> <p>Why <em>The Patagonian Hare</em>? Hares make three appearances in the book. The first is its opening, a passage reproduced from <em>The Golden Hare </em>by Silvina Ocampo, in which a hare is being chased by hounds: \"Where are we headed?\" cried the hare, in a voice that quavered like a lightning flash. \"To the end of your life', howled the dogs.\" \"I know the whole story by heart,\" says Lanzmann.</p> <p>The second describes a moment in Patagonia, which Lanzmann takes as a cue for the affirmation of life itself. He is driving when \"a long-legged hare leapt like an arrow and hopped across the road in front of me. I had just seen a Patagonian hare, a magical animal. Now, all of Patagonia suddenly pierced my heart with the sure knowledge of our mutual existence.\"</p> <p>He wears a tie with a repeated design of hares jumping around it. \"I love them,\" he says. \"I respect them, and their nobility. They are very, very beautiful animals. So fast, and their speed is their means of survival; every time I meet a hare, I know I am safe for a long time.\"</p> <p>The third mention in the book is by far its most spine-chilling moment \u2013 at once utterly surreal and spectrally redemptive in the strangest way: \"If there is any truth to metempsychosis and if I were given the choice,\" he writes, \"I would unhesitatingly come back as a hare. In <em>Shoah</em>, there are two shots that are fleeting but crucial to me, [one is of] a hare, its fur the colour of the earth, sitting by the barbed wire fence at Birkenau extermination camp while a rare escapee from Auschwitz called Rudolf Vrba speaks. As Vrba continues, we see the animal flatten its back, hunker down and crawl under the barbed wire. He too escapes. There is no killing in Auschwitz-Birkenau now, not even of animals; all forms of hunting are forbidden. No one keeps count of the hares, but there are a lot of them and I would like to think that many of my people chose, as I would, to come back as hares.\"</p> <p>\"I watched it, that animal,\" says Lanzmann, his final remark before we bid farewell, \"arriving at the fence at Auschwitz, and burrowing its way under the wire, cunning and determined, knowing it had to leave that place...\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2012.

      "bodyText": "It would have been interesting to have been a fly on the wall when Shalom Auslander pitched the idea for his latest book to his agent. One imagines the conversation would have gone something like this: \"I want to write about the Holocaust.\" \"Great. That sells.\" \"About Anne Frank.\" \"Even better.\" \"A guy discovers her living in his attic. She's a bitter old woman who swears, eats dead birds and defecates down air vents.\" Silence. The brilliance of Hope: A Tragedy is that it pulls off this potentially offensive conceptual feat with devastating aplomb. More than that, Auslander has written one of the funniest books of the last decade: a raging, hilarious polemic on the inescapability of history and the ambiguous nature of hope. The protagonist is Solomon Kugel, a young Jewish professional who yearns for nothing more than to protect his only child, three-year-old Jonah, from all the awful things that could happen to him. To this end, Kugel moves his family \u2013 including his wife Bree and his ageing mother \u2013 out of New York to a picturesque farmhouse in the rural town of Stockton. There is a local arsonist on the loose but otherwise Stockton is \"famous for nothing\". The nothingness appeals because Kugel is a man suffocated by history. His childhood was overshadowed by the constant threat of tragedy, encouraged by his mother who, despite being born in Brooklyn in 1946, imagines she is a survivor of the concentration camps. When a young Kugel asks why his mother has placed a lampshade beside him on the bed, she replies: \"That's your grandfather.\" When he protests that it says \"Made in Taiwan,\" his mother snaps: \"Well, they're not going to write Made in Buchenwald, are they?\" Kugel's mother is the source of much of the novel's blackest humour. In the farmhouse, she wakes up screaming every morning: \"She had done so ever since reading that this was common behaviour among survivors of the Holocaust.\" When Kugel recalls a trip the two of them made to a concentration camp when he was a teenager, he remembers his mother's ire when he mistakenly smiled while posing for a photo by the gas ovens. \"You ruined the whole concentration camp for me, you know that?\" Much of this runs the risk of being tasteless but Auslander is adept at treading the line between humour and offensiveness. The target of his satire is not the Holocaust itself but the mawkish self-absorption of those who use it for their own ends, who relish the hierarchy of victimhood rather than cherishing the triumph of survival. The living, breathing Anne Frank stands in metaphorical opposition to Kugel's mother: here is a survivor who cannot admit that she is still alive in case it debunks the powerful myth that she unwittingly created. After 60 years in hiding, Anne Frank is trapped in Kugel's attic by her own reputation. She spends her nights typing an endless manuscript and repeatedly reminds Kugel of her impressive sales figures. \"Thirty-two million copies,\" she screams as he attempts to coax her out of the attic. \"That's nothing to sneeze at!\" The irony is that Kugel becomes so obsessed with protecting Anne Frank that he forgets to look after his own family. Jonah \u2013 despite being the reason for moving to the country \u2013 makes only brief appearances. Bree moves out after Kugel refuses to evict the old lady from the attic. So it is that Kugel becomes crushed by the weight of his own cultural baggage. He remains caught between the desire to make things better and the belief that disaster lurks behind every street corner (throughout the novel, Kugel jots down possible \"last words\" in a special notebook so that, when the time comes, he will be ready with the appropriate bon mots). His existential plight is represented in the form of two supporting characters. Kugel's therapist, Professor Jove, insists that hope is a delusion and causes only unhappiness. On the other side is Kugel's brother-in-law, Pinkus, an academic who believes the world is becoming \"more humane, more caring, less violent\". Kugel seems to have more sympathy with the former: his family might disintegrate around him, he might have an unwanted tenant in the attic, his house might burn down, but at least he can always rely on hopelessness to be his faithful companion. It is to Auslander's credit that he riffs expertly on the human condition while writing a book that is also uproariously funny.",

On the other side is Kugel's brother-in-law, Pinkus, an academic who believes the world is becoming \"more humane, more caring, less violent\".</p> <p>Kugel seems to have more sympathy with the former: his family might disintegrate around him, he might have an unwanted tenant in the attic, his house might burn down, but at least he can always rely on hopelessness to be his faithful companion. It is to Auslander's credit that he riffs expertly on the human condition while writing a book that is also uproariously funny.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you are thrown from a horse, they say you should get straight back in the saddle. Over days of non-denial denials by Number 10 finally followed by a confession from the prime minister that he did ride the former police steed called Raisa, Westminster has chattered about what must be the biggest horse story in this island's political history since the unseating of Richard III. So yesterday David Cameron tried to reconcentrate minds on the bigger picture by delivering what was billed as a big, definitional speech. Some prime ministerial speeches are interesting because of what they have to say to the country; some are informative because of what they have to say to their party. Then there are those speeches that are revealing because you catch a leader talking to himself. This was one of those. What Mr Cameron had to say to his activists \u2013 you're all great \u2013 was entirely unsurprising. What Mr Cameron had to say to the country \u2013 for all the cuts, I'm still a compassionate Conservative \u2013 was also predictable. Then there was the interesting bit when we caught the prime minister having a debate with himself about what sort of prime minister he wanted to be. There was, he said, \"a real temptation to take a cautious path\" and listen to those people who \"tell you that if you want that majority at the next election then go easy. Do the popular thing. Try the small things. Be a steady hand on the tiller and don't rub people up the wrong way. I hear it all the time.\" I am sure he does. He hears it from advisers within Number 10 who have become alarmed that the government is fighting on so many fronts. He hears it from the side of himself that is gnawed by his failure to win an outright Tory victory at the last election and fixated on securing one at the next. His claim yesterday was that \"I didn't come into politics to play it safe\" and the challenges demanded that \"we've got to be tough and bold\". Well, no leader is ever going to say it is his aim to be feeble and timid. And whether you like the policies of his government or not, you might not think it really needs to be asserted that it has embarked on big changes in education, health and welfare in the midst of austerity and at a time of an unprecedented squeeze on public spending. So when David Cameron feels he has nevertheless to claim boldness and toughness, who is he trying to convince? Himself, I think. And also those Tories who complain that they are not really being anything like radical enough. And particularly one old, close friend, so close that his Number 10 office is adjacent to that of the prime minister, and who has been privately complaining for months that the government plays it far too safe. Steve Hilton is often described as David Cameron's \"most influential adviser\". This was certainly true once, but Mr Hilton himself has clearly felt for some time that this was no longer the case if influence is measured by getting the prime minister to follow your advice. To an extent, I take at face value the official explanation for his departure to an unpaid academic job at Stanford University. This is a situation when a political figure says he is quitting to spend more time with his family and actually means it. Mr Hilton's wife works for Google in California as their communications chief. They have two small children. He did something similar when the Tories were in opposition, living on the west coast of America for some months before returning to be by his friend's side. Yet as another adviser puts it: \"You can do that in opposition, but not in government. Government is different. You can't take a sabbatical from government.\" Though it is the publicly stated intention that Mr Hilton will return to Number 10 next summer, a lot of insiders are sceptical. It is a telling departure because Steve Hilton invented David Cameron. At least, he did so in the sense that he was the most significant shaper of his friend's public persona when they were trying to get out of opposition and into power. Nearly all of the most important devices and themes used to project David Cameron as a different kind of Conservative were developed by Mr Hilton. It all seems a rather long time ago now, but you may just about remember that version of Cameron, the one who hugged huskies to show how much he cared about climate change, talked about GDP being less important than national well-being, described the big society as his great passion and cried: \"Let sunshine rule the day!\" For many Conservatives, these were just cynical presentational stunts, to be tolerated only because they might help to get them elected. But Mr Hilton actually believed in it all. In government, he tried to get the statistical office to draw up an index of national happiness. Since his departure was announced, a lot has been said and written about how thwarted he felt by the roadblocks to his ideas put up by the Lib Dems, the European Union and the civil service. But the more important story behind his leaving is that he felt disillusioned with his own side. As one senior Lib Dem puts it: \"His frustration wasn't really with us or the civil servants, but with his own party.\" Many of the ideas he pushed in opposition have withered on the vine of government. He was a sincere believer in a green agenda, but George Osborne, with whom he has always competed for influence over David Cameron, never was. The Treasury is now a publicly announced enemy of making a priority of the environment and the chancellor will always be a much more powerful figure than even the most senior Number 10 adviser. I can't recall the last time that David Cameron made a speech on the environment; it did not feature at all in yesterday's text. Nor did the big society, which Mr Hilton had once persuaded David Cameron to make the animating theme of his premiership. The Hilton concept of Cameroonism has been a victim of changed economic circumstances. It was effectively killed by the financial crash and the ensuing recession. The project he built for his friend in opposition was designed for a time of plenty rather than a period of austerity. It assumed that the most important issue in British politics would be how best to share the proceeds of growth. As things have turned out, the most important issue for this government is how you spread the pain of austerity. Sunshine has not ruled the day since David Cameron walked over the threshold of Number 10. Black skies have shed sleet and hail. All governments have a tension between their romantic idealists, who think they are there to transform the world tomorrow, and their cautious pragmatists, who think the world can only be changed carefully and slowly. Mr Hilton was on the extreme end of political romanticism. That put him at odds with other figures at Number 10 and led to repeated clashes with the chancellor who is generally the most influential advocate of pragmatism within the prime minister's inner circle. The pragmatists work on the basis that the priority is not to jeopardise Tory chances of winning a parliamentary majority at the next election. The romantics think that more gets done if you work on the assumption that you may only get one chance at power. Mr Hilton often urged Mr Cameron to govern as if he only expected one term as prime minister and use every day of the five years to ram through radical and lasting change. That counsel horrified the pragmatists with their focus on aiming to win a Tory majority in 2015. The question sharpened by this departure is to which side does the prime minister really belong? His speech yesterday scoffed that \"public service isn't a popularity contest\" as if the last thing ever on his mind is the next election. That simply can't be true. On some issues, David Cameron plays it very safe. It is emerging from the internal arguments about what should be in the budget that the prime minister is the biggest obstacle to funding income tax cuts by raising more from property taxes. He frets about the reaction from Tory activists and voters. Some time ago, most of the important players in the coalition concluded that they needed a much more radical policy for elected mayors. Only by giving them much more power would they make a real difference to their cities. With the Lib Dems on board, Mr Hilton pressed the prime minister to embrace the bold option. He wouldn't agree on the grounds that he didn't want to be \"accused of doing another U-turn\", a response that his friend found depressingly feeble. That can be contrasted with other occasions when David Cameron has demonstrated that he can be a risk-taking prime minister. Over the intervention in Libya, he took an admirable gamble. Over the NHS, he is taking a reckless one with a big, vital and much-loved national institution and his own electoral prospects. Boldness and toughness are important qualities in a leader, but what matters most is taking the right risks.",

By setting a traditional Russian folk story against the grim backdrop of 1920s Alaska, her tale charmingly combines the real and the fantastical. Jack and Mabel are a childless couple feeling the strain of winters on the frontier. In a rare moment of frivolity, they build a child out of snow. Overnight, the snow child disappears and in its place a blond-haired girl appears. It is unclear whether the infant is real or magical. Ivey's elegant writing contrasts with the rough places she describes; it is unsurprising that she lives in Alaska, because she depicts the cold, sparse and brutal landscape with real fondness. The Snow Child has a warmth in keeping with its folk tale origins, yet the narrative is far removed from the world of \"happily ever after\".",

      "bodyText": "On the one hand, there are those who think computer coders are the geekiest nerds around. The kind of people \u2013 no, let's not beat about the bush here \u2013 the kind of men whose lack of personal skills and inability to get a girlfriend simply means that they have too much time on their hands because they're not having sex. Then there are the people like me who think it would be quite cool to hack into the CIA's mainframe. Would I like to learn how to write code in a day? Well, of course I would. I'm from the pre-Google era and consider computer code to be some sort of magic faerie spell sent from the Gods above. Who wouldn't want to know how to write magic faerie spells in a day? Decoded, a new London-based company that has set up the course, puts it slightly differently: it claims I'll be able to build a multifunction geo-location app in a day. But it's still a pretty bold statement, particularly given, how shall we say, certain technical challenges. Still, it's a pretty slick set-up. I show up at 9.30am at the appointed location, just off Silicon Roundabout, the heart of Britain's small but plucky tech industry, in the kind of super-cool warehouse flat that a middle-aged man, post-divorce, might buy, and meet the Decoded team and a group of nine other budding web developers. Only they're not. In the opening session, we lounge around on tasteful, designer sofas and introduce ourselves. There's a brace of CEOs who want to get teched up, a smattering of ad men looking slightly concerned about what the future might bring, but by far the greatest proportion of participants are actually from the tech industry. People who commission web content or lead interactive teams but who are about as au fait with code as they are with Klingon. But then, they're exactly the people that Decoded is targeting. They're a team of four, mostly ex-advertising, who spotted the great flaw at the heart of the digital economy: namely, that the people with power don't have much of a clue what the people with the technical expertise are actually on about. In the beating heart of tech UK, it becomes abundantly clear that it's perfectly possibly to talk the talk, or to have a high-flying job with a leading multimedia company, without any technical knowledge at all. \"And that's a pity,\" says Alasdair Blackwell, Decoded's resident code guru. \"Because they're missing out on half the creative process.\" Like many of the best web developers, Blackwell is self-taught. As a student, he took a play to the Edinburgh fringe, was asked to update the production's website, bought himself a teach yourself book and never looked back. Blackwell believes that everyone should know about code. \"We deal with computers almost every single waking hour of our lives. They're everywhere in the western world. And yet only a tiny proportion of people know anything about the language that's at the heart of them.\" What seems extraordinary, given the growing importance to the economy, and the grand political statements made about the tech economy, is that it's simply not taught in schools. But as Decoded has discovered, the demand is there: its courses are fully booked, Downing Street has asked for its advice, and when it went into a local school recently, 160 pupils applied to take part. But can we really learn the basics in a day? It seems unlikely, particularly given that the major part of the morning is spent lounging around trying to look cool while listening to Blackwell and Richard Peters, a fellow director, summarise the history of the internet and the role that computer code has played in its development. It's all things that I vaguely know \u2013 Tim Berners-Lee and HTML and the open source movement. But there's also lots that I don't \u2013 the origins of Javascript right up to the API revolution of recent times, which has seen companies such as Facebook open up their code to all-comers. Nor have I heard it framed so succinctly as a contextual narrative before. It's so interesting, I could lounge and listen all day. Then it's lunch, a rather classy home-made flatbreads-and-interesting-salads affair, and I'm starting to think that really, if this is what coding involves, I don't know why I didn't do it sooner when, dammit, Alasdair makes us sit down at a computer. We're going to build a geo-location app, ie one that uses a phone's GPS to deliver a message when a user arrives at a location. And to do this, we have to code in three languages simultaneously: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML serves the browser content, CSS controls what it looks like and JavaScript tells it how to behave. Oh, yes, easy. Alasdair shows us how to write the code for our headline and how to paste a photo, how to spin it around, and have the title fade into view, and then, lo! I open up a browser and it really is quite unbelievably bad: the font is terrible, the background amateurish, the layout a joke. The only comfort is that the one created by my fellow student Paul Bainsfair, the director general of the IPA, advertising's professional body, who's sitting next to me, is possibly even more cruddy. \"Christ,\" he says. \"Look at that. It's like it's 1994 all over again.\" I like his welcome message, though: \"Hi. Welcome to the site. Its purpose is to befuddle the reader with mindless corporate psychobabble.\" Alasdair gives us some more code and I manage to align my photo somewhere near the centre of the page. Then he gives the game away. Every bit of code you'll ever need has already been written. \"You just have to work out where to nick it from?\" I say. \"Actually, we don't use the word 'nick',\" says Richard. \"We use the word 'match'.\" Yes, it's really very different. You just have to work out where to \"match\" it from and owing to the work of a super-nice man called John Resig, who spent seven years writing a code encyclopaedia called jQuery, this really isn't all that difficult. In fact, if you have a keenly logical mind, and a high level of attention to detail, none of it is that difficult. I have neither and I get brain ache. By the time Alasdair has got us \"matching\" a piece of cutting-edge code from the Boston Globe's website, I'm close to a nervous collapse. It's the most intensive learning experience I've had in a decade, and while I feel like I've just sat finals, I'm also strangely euphoric: I have built an app! What's more, Alasdair claims that the single line of code we've cut and pasted from the Boston Globe's site, which automatically resizes our website according to the size of the page, is so bleeding edge that my site is actually more technologically actually more advanced than the Observer's. Really? \"It's literally only existed for a couple of weeks,\" he says. What can I say? I have been inside the magic kingdom of code, if only for a day, and the magic faerie spells make just a tiny bit more sense. Though the CIA mainframe may take a short while longer.",

Unlike the Titian, Ms Dahl will note, the importance of the ancestral hut, which requires a \u00a3500,000 renovation, was hardly disputed. Admittedly, the comparison is inexact: Titian never had the good fortune to live in Great Missenden. He cannot at this distance be accounted much of a lovable eccentric, nor does the story of Diana and Callisto come near to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for humour, incident and cautionary effect. Moreover, while Sophie was chugging for Dahl-aid, the English and Scottish National Galleries did not make a public case for raising the Duke of Sutherland's \u00a345m, anticipating \u2013 correctly \u2013 that the times are not propitious. But to look at the overwhelmingly hostile online response to the National Gallery's use of its funds to secure, in Diana and Callisto, not a crumbling hut, but the acclaimed pair to an existing old master that will \u2014 unlike the Dahl museum (adult entry \u00a36) \u2013 be available for everyone to see, you would think the directors had snatched the picture money from orphans or from the beseeching hooves of piteous, starving donkeys, prior to blowing it all on a Banksy or, worse, a foreign Banksy. \"It's not as if it's Jock McTitian,\" the Glasgow MP, Ian Davidson, has pointed out. The Titians are evidently still well dodgy after being in Britain over 200 years and on public view since 1945. In these circumstances, the Ashmolean Museum, which has chosen this inopportune moment to solicit donations for a \u00a38m, privately owned Manet \u2013 not as if it's Jock McImpressionist \u2013 may soon find itself the museum equivalent of a Romanian Big Issue seller. Eclipsing quibbles about Titian's foreignness and technique and abundant contempt for the painting's seller, the predominant emotion in debates on the BBC, Independent and Guardian websites \u2013 places where spending on culture is hardly, de facto, an absurdity \u2013 has been fury that the National Gallery should consider fine art a priority at a time of cuts and hardship. That no monkey with a paintbrush could have painted Diana and Callisto cannot redeem Titian in a climate when any arts spending, new or old, may be interpreted as a preening, callous snub, eg: \"How can canvas with some oil on it really be worth 45 MILLION pounds! How many doctors and nurses is that?\" It probably depends on the nurse or doctor, but if the comparison has to be in public money, the sum could readily be converted into unwanted swine flu vaccine (\u00a3150m) or BBC 3 (\u00a3115m) or bonuses at the state-owned bank, RBS (\u00a3785m) or the Olympics (\u00a39bn). But as the National Gallery has attempted to stress, it avoided, by not appealing to the public, diverting funds from the poor. Money for the latest Titian was raised principally from living benefactors and historic donations that constitute the gallery's reserves, which the director now describes as \"depleted\". None the less, as opponents of this purchase have pointed out, a contribution of \u00a33m came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, courtesy of the very social classes who are still, notwithstanding free entry, least likely to visit the national art galleries. \"These sumptuous late great works of Titian bring joy and pleasure to all,\" says Antony Gormley. But in particular, it appears, they bring pleasure to the more affluent social groups whose repeat visits are thought to account for much of the huge increase in visitor numbers since Labour abolished entry fees. Moreover, if the response to the Titians is any guide, a decade of free entry has yet to eradicate a perception that these galleries serve an elite and spend money in ways that must look comically indulgent to anyone struggling to survive. You wonder, in fact, if the new acquisition might have looked more appealing, in this pinched climate, had it been subsidised, in place of lottery players, by those who can afford to pay, occasionally, for their repeat visits in the way they already do to see oversubscribed Hockney and Leonardo blockbusters. Alternatively, if some of the Titian money came from a tourist precept rather than a gamblers' one, the transaction might look less offensive to its critics. Walking freely into London's tourist-crammed galleries, you can feel as nettled by this difference from every other capital city (even those in Scandinavia that are populated exclusively by our highly taxed social-democratic mentors) as proud of the unique, British offer of free access, which has acquired, for some reason, a sanctity that combines, to the point of abolishing any discussion of fairness, the NHS's \"free at the point of use\" principle with the growing, internet-bred conviction that only idiots pay. Perhaps inevitably, the most prominent supporters of free entry and the brilliant way it allows one repeatedly to \"pop in\" often seem to be the people who, along with the opportunity for all this popping, evidently have the means to pay for it. The latest attack on entry fees (for the blockbuster exhibitions) came, risibly, from Charles Saatchi. Unlike child benefit, trust funds, other universal benefits from the fat years, this particular entitlement, subsidised by lottery and scratchcard players, remains, as Tristram Hunt discovered, when he proposed, in fairness to council-run museums, the resumption of entry fees, too precious a shibboleth to adjust by so much as the cost of a phone app, a swim or a National Gallery latte. Last year, Brian Sewell \u2013 a former enthusiast for free admission \u2013 estimated that just a \u00a31 entry fee, while money is short, could pay, in one year for a Titian \"and probably a major exhibition in every institution\". Assuming, anyway, the payment of a nominal sum, the guarantee of some free days and the exemption, as in Paris, of nationals under 26 and benefit claimants, how is this funding more outrageous than charging families to visit other cultural destinations, no less owned by \"us\", from the Tower of London, the royal palaces and Stonehenge, to Kew Gardens, English Heritage's mansions and ruins, the National theatre and that temple of open access, the Royal Opera House? Not forgetting, of course, the great collection of Olympic, soon to be completely worthless, stadia in which any patriot lucky enough to win the ticket lottery will pay up to \u00a3725 for \"premium events\" (no concessions). It is partly, no doubt, because of fears of what Cameron's terrifyingly philistine government might do to museums, once it has trashed the libraries and finished counselling the film industry, that free access to museums has become totemic, even when budgets have been slashed, hours are being cut and the cost of a masterpiece is counted, bitterly, in nurses. But even if Titian's flesh puts you in mind, as it did the great Tom Lubbock, of \"luminous pastry\", it's not going to be the last art worth buying.",

      "bodyText": "It is widely regarded as the body's least useful organ, a block of intestinal tissue that often becomes inflamed and occasionally threatens to kill us. But the appendix is getting a bad press, says US surgery expert Bill Parker. Far from being an organ of evil, it serves a very useful function \u2013 by acting as a safe house for beneficial bacteria in our bodies. In effect, the much-reviled organ is really a sanctuary for helpful microbes, explains Parker, an assistant professor of experimental surgery at Duke University medical centre, in Durham, North Carolina. \"My idea is that the appendix is a storehouse, a cultivation centre for the normal, beneficial bacteria that our gut needs,\" he says. \"That safe house would be necessary and useful in the event that the main compartment of bacteria, the large bowel, got contaminated with some kind of infectious organism and got flushed out.\" The appendix is not unique to Homo sapiens. The great apes, other primates, the opossum, the wombat and rabbits: all have appendices. And in each case, Parker argues that the appendix behaves in a similar manner: as a resupply centre for benign microbes. A crucial part of Parker's theory rests on the importance of the bacteria found in our intestines. Our bodies are made up of around 10 trillion cells. However, we carry about 10 times as many microorganisms inside our bodies, and most of these are found in our gut. Their relationship with humans is symbiotic. The bacteria take some of our sources of energy, our food in other words, and in return they help to prevent the growth of harmful, pathogenic bacteria, and also produce vitamins and hormones. They are crucial to our wellbeing, in short. \"Periodically, bacteria get shed out of the appendix,\" says Parker. Bacteria from the appendix can then reinoculate the system, he adds. \"They would reboot the system and help those good bacteria get growing again.\" Parker first outlined his ideas about the appendix in 2007 and researchers have since been searching for evidence to support them. In the current issue of Scientific American, one group has now revealed that it has found intriguing evidence that suggests Parker may be correct. A team led by James Grendell, at Winthrop-University hospital on Long Island, studied 254 patients who had histories of gut infections caused by Clostridium difficile. The bacterium \u2013 C diff, as it is usually known by doctors \u2013 is a deadly pathogen that is often encountered in hospitals among patients who have been put on prolonged courses of antibiotics. These powerful doses of antibiotics can badly deplete the benign bacteria in patients' guts. When this happens, C diff \u2013 which they pick up from infected items in a hospital or nursing home \u2013 can grow quickly and take over their gut. The patient will then suffer severe bouts of diarrhoea. But if Parker's idea is right, individuals without an appendix should be more likely to have recurrences of C diff infections than those with one. The latter group's appendices would provide sources for replenishing their guts with benign bacteria that would hold the C diff at bay. And that is precisely what Grendell's group found. They discovered that patients without an appendix were more than twice as likely to have a recurrence of C difficile infections. Recurrence in individuals with their appendix intact occurred in 18% of cases. Recurrence in those without their appendix occurred in 45% of cases. Darwin suggested that the organ was used by ancient humans for digesting leaves but as people's diets changed it shrank and degraded to how we find it today. But Parker's work is a striking piece of support for the idea that the appendix \u2013 far from being a redundant evolutionary vestige \u2013 has a role to play inside our bodies. The work is not proof that Parker is right, but it does suggest the scientist is on to something. As he says: \"From all the signals we're now getting from the scientific community, it looks like we may be right on target.\" However, Parker stresses he does not believe that people should hesitate in having an appendix removed should it become badly infected. Modern medicines can today provide the protection that appendices supplied in our evolutionary past. \"It's really important to say that even though the appendix has a function, if you have that pain in the lower-right quadrant, get it taken out,\" he says. \"It's life-threatening if you don't get it taken out, and you really don't need it in this culture.\"",

The patient will then suffer severe bouts of diarrhoea.</p> <p>But if Parker's idea is right, individuals without an appendix should be more likely to have recurrences of <em>C diff</em> infections than those with one. The latter group's appendices would provide sources for replenishing their guts with benign bacteria that would hold the <em>C diff</em> at bay.</p> <p>And that is precisely what Grendell's group found. They discovered that patients without an appendix were more than twice as likely to have a recurrence of <em>C difficile</em> infections. Recurrence in individuals with their appendix intact occurred in 18% of cases. Recurrence in those without their appendix occurred in 45% of cases.</p> <p>Darwin suggested that the organ was used by ancient humans for digesting leaves but as people's diets changed it shrank and degraded to how we find it today. But Parker's work is a striking piece of support for the idea that the appendix \u2013 far from being a redundant evolutionary vestige \u2013 has a role to play inside our bodies. The work is not proof that Parker is right, but it does suggest the scientist is on to something. As he says: \"From all the signals we're now getting from the scientific community, it looks like we may be right on target.\"</p> <p>However, Parker stresses he does not believe that people should hesitate in having an appendix removed should it become badly infected. Modern medicines can today provide the protection that appendices supplied in our evolutionary past. \"It's really important to say that even though the appendix has a function, if you have that pain in the lower-right quadrant, get it taken out,\" he says. \"It's life-threatening if you don't get it taken out, and you really don't need it in this culture.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "When my first-born was three, he was talking to his grandmother about his upcoming birthday \u2013 a Batman-themed costume party for a dozen lusty male toddlers that I still shudder to recall \u2013 and something clearly suddenly struck him. \"Grandma! Grandma! You,\" he said with urgency, eyes wide, \"you are so old\u2026 that not even grown-ups know how old you are.\" My mother was then 54, ie only a year older than Madonna is now. To a three-year-old, however, her age was so advanced it was impossible to compute, like counting grains of sand on a beach or stars in the sky. \"Not even grown-ups\" has naturally entered the lexicon as shorthand for \"knocking on\", a bracing reminder that while children grow up, adults just grow old and the young will never let us ever forget this. As I contemplate the meaning of middle age from my great height of 46, I know one thing for certain. You may feel young. You may look young and act young. But anyone who actually is young (let's say under 25) sees you with one foot firmly in the grave. I may regard myself as middle aged (the phrase middle youth has nothing to recommend it), but to anyone under 25, I am basically Methuselah. When my parents got divorced in their 30s, I was 13 and I assumed that that was it for them. When my father hit 40, it was obvious to his four children that the game was over, the commedia was finita. We returned from holiday early in order to comfort him on the crack of doom (ie his 40th) in mid-August. I remember him meeting us off the train in Taunton. He hadn't warned us that he'd had his two front teeth filed to stumps in preparation for capping. He smiled in happy greeting and we all reeled back in horror at the grisly sight. \"Oh my God, is this what 40 looks like,\" I remember thinking. I was wrong about the mezzo del cammin di nostra vita being the end of the road. Both my parents remarried, my father reproduced again twice, and he recently celebrated his 70th birthday by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, while my mother is completing a huge painting of the view from my brother's office in City Hall. I do not think that having children \u2013 I have three teenagers \u2013 keeps you young. The reverse. It thrusts you into a full-frontal confrontation with your own all-too-obvious maturity. So now I am middle aged, my children are having exactly the same pitying thoughts about me as I had about my parents. To a teenager, a woman over 40 is a potential walking embarrassment, especially if she tries to pretend she is 1) down with the kids; 2) lacks a mutton alert; or 3) her mum. I was hunting for something in a drawer and came across a Levi's mini-skirt of my daughter's and I'm afraid I put it on \u2013 with flip-flops. When she saw me, my daughter's eyes widened a fraction. A millimetre, imperceptible to all but her mother, but a lethal movement all the same. \"Mum,\" she said. \"Take it off.\" \"Why?\" I whined, somewhat babyishly. \"Don't tell me you want to wear it just because I'm wearing it.\" \"It's not that,\" she explained, as if to a very small child. \"You're, like, far too old for it.\" So it's all a matter of perception. The reason we all need a mutton alert, which needs constant testing, like smoke alarms, is because there is really no such thing as age-appropriate dressing any longer, as I know because my wardrobe is interchangeable with my daughter's. Fifty years ago, most women over 35 looked like the Queen and all women over 60 had blue rinses. Now, we can be \"1664s\" \u2013 a woman who looks 16 from the back and 64 from the front. And while we're frightfully good at clocking the other 45-year-old woman who wears low-rise jeans to church and thinks it's absolutely fine to treat the congregation to a clear view of her bumcrack and thong as she receives the host, we also still think we can get away with Converse, bikini and muffin-top because we are special, we are different, we possess what the magazines call ageless style. Except, of course, we don't. We look ridiculous, but who cares? With so many forty- and fiftysomething mums and dads in Converse stalking the streets, I can see why there's a slew of books about the menopause and middle age, the most recent addition being David Bainbridge's plucky, glass-half-full meditation or, as he calls it, \"natural history.\" As half the population (or whatever it is) will soon be over 50, there is presumably a healthy market for books like this. \"A strong thread running through my new story of middle age is that human midlife is a positive, not a negative thing,\" Bainbridge writes. \"I would go so far as to say that it is a liberation \u2013 evolutionarily, culturally and personally.\" I'm afraid phrases such as \"new story of middle age\" remind me of a book I skimmed about the menopause that argued that \"old was the new old\" and trumpeted the message: \"You don't have to grow old!\" relentlessly. They don't ring true; not in the way that Clarence Darrow's: \"The first half of our lives is ruined by our parents, the second half by our children\" rings true, at any rate, to me. What seems clear from these books is that the authors would ideally like ageing to be yet another choice. But it's not. It's a fact. As most of the population is middle aged now, it's understandable there is a move to reclaim and decontaminate middle age, just as Justin Timberlake wanted \"SexyBack\". What I am forced to conclude from my study of both the genre and my peer group is this: middle age is a construct of the middle aged. But to our children, there is no such thing as middle age. If you're not young, like them, you are old. There is nothing in between. Rachel Johnson, sister of Boris, is a writer and editor of the Lady magazine.

      "bodyText": "For me, middle age has been a creatively abundant time. David Bainbridge talks about middle age being an era of flux, not crisis, a time of stability as well as personal, creative and sexual liberation. Yes, I would agree with all of this. I'm aware of being in my prime. He says we're at the height of our cognitive powers in middle age; he talks of our \"cognitive excellence\" and that rather than slowing down midlife, we can actually speed up or expand. The \"clock of life\" still ticks inside us. Women, he says, tend to flourish mentally later than men, hence middle age is a peak time for women. Yup, that sounds about right. I became single at 41. While there was heartbreak, I found I'd been released into a rich and varied metropolitan landscape that had liberal ideas around being single and being fortysomething. I'd moved to London and the big city offered lots of choice. My world was (and still is) peopled with like-minded spirits: fellow writers, artists, sexual adventurers, outliers, baby-boomers and late developers who were carving out a life that didn't adhere to the mainstream heterosexual model of how to live well. Briefly, I lived in an infamous housing co-op, then moved to a flat with a couple. They had a baby. We became a small, functioning, if a little eccentric, family pod. I was writing a novel and travelled to Trinidad a lot. I currently share a large house with an artist. I have lived communally in these middle years, with a family and with friends. Lovers came and went and I've had my heart exercised again and again in this middle period of my life. All this wasn't what I'd expected of middle age. I thought it might be humdrum. I thought I'd die of boredom in middle age. I thought I'd grow fat, go bald, look soggy. Actually, I have grown fat. I'm a stone heavier than I once was. But while I looked great in my 20s and 30s, my internal self wasn't as rich as it is today. What's gone is emotional recklessness, lack of self-awareness, ridiculous egoism and self-obsession.My younger self was far too critical and unforgiving of myself and others. That person has disappeared. What's also gone is attachment to the archetypal narrative, the girlish dream of the princess and the prince, the notion of living within a stable monogamous relationship forever. My middle years of sexual self-inquiry have led me into seeing many other possibilities of how to live well. That traditional narrative now feels like one of several choices rather than a naively assumed destiny. The romantic idealism of my youth has been replaced with realism and hard work at what I love. I still daydream a lot, like I did when I was younger; I can still stare at walls for hours. But today, these daydreams, dreams and fantasies get taken to my psychoanalyst. Today, I'm a jobbing dreamer who turns creative ideas into books, who has a realistic sense of the work, mental energy and stamina needed to lead a creative life. Mostly, my 40s have been years of enormous creative activity and growth. I have written three books in the past six years \u2013 which feels like a lot. I am actually making myself take a year off. 2012 is a fallow year for me, the year I don't write a word. Instead, I've allowed myself some downtime. I will only do research. It seems to me there's so much to write about. Apart from writing books, my 40s have been about pursuing personal growth. Whatever were the mistakes of my earlier life, I've been committed to a pause, a regroup. I don't want to make the same mistakes in the future.There have been years of tantra workshops, months of Jungian analysis and recently I have joined a therapy group. I dance a lot and meditate too.Creatively, all this has had the effect of Bio-Gro on a crop of tomatoes. The work on myself has been one of the reasons for so much creative output; the two go hand in hand. Bainbridge's research shows that our libidos don't decline in middle age. Rather, sexually, we enjoy better sex, sex that lasts longer. In middle age we still fancy each other. In short, he says middle-aged people aren't to be dismissed as a sexual force. Yup, again all of this resonates. In my 40s, I haven't \"disappeared\". The much anticipated and talked-about sexual vanishing act didn't happen to me or any of my friends. Something has changed about all this. Middle-aged women don't melt, don't morph into a dead zone of domestic chores and cardigans. Men still look at me; younger men, older men and men my own age. Women also look at me in that way, something I enjoy and welcome. Generally, I'm a fancier, I have a broad sexual interest for all sorts of people; many people fascinate. Not just a few. At 43, I found myself in my first tantric sex workshop, at 46, I am arranging my first bespoke \"conscious BDSM\" (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sado-masochism) session. Much sexual inquiry happened in between. In the last two years two lovers showed up who taught me a lot. My 40s have beena time of lovers, teachers and guides, also a time of older women who have been influences, mentors and role models. These have been boom years. I have pursued the art of loving well, sexually and otherwise, and I have written three books. These years have taken me by surprise; I didn't expect them to be so action-packed.

At 43, I found myself in my first tantric sex workshop, at 46, I am arranging my first bespoke \"conscious BDSM\" (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sado-masochism) session. Much sexual inquiry happened in between. In the last two years two lovers showed up who taught me a lot.</p> <p>My 40s have beena time of lovers, teachers and guides, also a time of older women who have been influences, mentors and role models. These have been boom years. I have pursued the art of loving well, sexually and otherwise, and I have written three books. These years have taken me by surprise; I didn't expect them to be so action-packed.</p> <p><em>Monique Roffey is a novelist who teaches creative writing.

      "bodyText": "The other day, I was having a conversation with another middle-aged man about something that had happened, in a pub, quite recently. Last spring, we thought. That sounded about right. It had been sunny. We'd been sitting at the bar. Then the thing had happened. But something was out of kilter. Things didn't quite fit. For a while, we weren't quite sure what it was. Perhaps it was the pub. But no, it wasn't the pub. Maybe the people. But it wasn't the people. We were sure about the people. So what was it? We backtracked. We searched our memories. We'd been watching a football match. We'd been discussing the prospects of various players in the World Cup. Would Fabregas make the Spanish team? Might there be a final chance for Michael Owen? That's the conversation we'd been having, before the thing happened. \"So this was 2010.\" \"Last year, right?\" \"No \u2013 last year was 2011.\" He was right. It wasn't the pub, or the people. It was the year. Our minds were telling us that something had happened 10 months ago, when it had really happened 22 months ago. Somehow, we'd misplaced a year. We checked the facts. The year that the World Cup had been held in South Africa, the year England had performed so badly, the year Fabregas laid on the winning goal for Spain \u2013 that wasn't last year. Those things happened the year before last. I've always been aware that time appears to move at different speeds. Everybody knows that. As children, we know what it's like, during a dull lesson, to look at the clock on the wall, and then to look again, eons later, to find that the hands have hardly moved. The clock actually appears to have stopped. To use a sporting analogy, we know what it's like when our team are a goal ahead, with five minutes to go. Those five minutes can feel like a month. Equally, we know what it's like to be on the other side of the equation \u2013 when you're a goal behind, with five minutes to go. Those five minutes can feel like five seconds. In other words, when you need time to go fast, it has a habit of going slowly and when you need it to go slowly, it speeds up. Time, it seems, is your enemy. When you're really enjoying yourself, when you'd benefit if time slowed down a bit, it slips away. When you're having a bad time \u2013 say, in the dentist's chair \u2013 time hangs around, overstaying its welcome. And when you're middle aged, when you begin to see the first faint outline of death on the horizon, when you could do with putting the brakes on a bit, you find, to your horror, that your brakes don't work. You want to chug towards death in a leisurely fashion. But you're not chugging. You're hurtling. A year, I thought. A year! Just like that. Where had 2011 gone? And, for that matter, why does time speed up? And is there a cure for this? Is there any way of slowing it down? There is a character in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22, Dunbar, who tries to solve the problem of time speeding up by only doing boring things. But that's not the answer, is it? If you did that, you'd get the worst of both worlds \u2013 you'd be bored and your life would speed up. Hardly the recipe for happiness. So why does it happen, this middle-aged acceleration? David Bainbridge makes a few suggestions. When we're young, he says, we often find ourselves doing something for the first time. When you do something for the first time, it sticks in your memory. For instance, I have often given talks to groups of people. I can remember these talks, or at least some of them. But I remember the first talk I gave with a special clarity. I remember the room, and the audience, even what I was wearing. This one talk takes up as much space in my memory as 10 or 20 subsequent talks. Looking back, the first one seemed to take ages. The next 10 whizzed by. Time, then, is not accelerating. It's just appearing to accelerate, because I don't do so many new things. Another thing that adds to the problem comes from simple mathematics \u2013 when I was 30, 10 years was a third of my life; at 60, it will represent a sixth. Neither of these things is much help. I could start to do new things, such as scuba diving or mountaineering, which might slow down time for a while. But I can see this might cause a further problem. I'd get used to novelty itself and then nothing would work \u2013 by trying to slow time down, I would actually speed it up. Bainbridge suggests a Darwinian answer to the problem. Maybe human beings have evolved to feel the acceleration of time as they enter middle age. When we're children, we spend our time learning things; later, we spend it providing for our children. Then our children grow up and we have more time on our hands. But, if we're not careful, we might waste this precious time, so we've evolved a special sense that it's slipping away. This might have the effect of spurring us on, as opposed to sitting back and resting on our laurels. So things are not entirely bleak. On the downside, I'm moving towards death. I wish I could stroll, but someone has fitted me with a jet engine. Worse, this jet engine will propel me faster with every passing day. Month. Year. Decade. But at least it will scare me out of my complacency, if I had any. It's a call to action. It says: the clock is ticking. It says: don't lounge about in pubs, talking about the World Cup. Next time it won't be just a year you lose. William Leith is a writer and journalist best known for his books The Hungry Years: Confessions of a Food Addict and Bits of Me Are Falling Apart.",

      "bodyText": "The text of the following article was originally delivered as the Terence Kilmartin memorial lecture at the Dartington Ways With Words Festival. Reviewers are lazy; critics are not. Reviewers are viewed by genuine writers with a mixture of foreboding and contempt. The status and, indeed, physical condition of the reviewer is summed up in a trenchant article by George Orwell. The man looks older than he is. He sits at a table covered with rubbish which he dare not disturb, for there may be a small cheque lying under it. He began his sub-literary career as a genuinely literary one, with high hopes, noble aspirations. But he has sunk to the condition of a hack. He has learnt the trick of reviewing anything, including books he has no hope of understanding. He earns little money and is unlikely to earn the accolade of a state award for services to literature. Services to reviewing are not recognised either at Buckingham Palace or in the office of the Prime Minister. This despicable rat, gnawing away at the fringes of literature, is only ennobled by being one of a pack kept encaged by a literary editor. Or, to exalt the animal metaphor, an also-ran of his literary editor's stable. In this image the term \"hack\" finds its proper connotation. Literary editors, on the whole, are respectable members of society. They are literary men in a sense that reviewers are not. If we are prepared to speak of great literary editors, we must number the late Terence Kilmartin among them. I was never a member of the salaried reviewing team that came and went at the Observer, but, as a freelance writer, I did what reviewing work he requested from 1960 till the year he retired \u2013 and, of course, beyond. Thus I knew him for about 30 years and can speak of his qualities. Terry will be remembered as a literary editor only by a comparatively narrow circle of book-lovers; his achievement as a translator ensures him a much larger public for a very long time. There was a time when we considered that the Scott Moncrieff version of A La Recherche du Temps Perdu was the supreme English Proust. Then Terry showed Scott Moncrieff where he had gone wrong. Terry, in my view, does not await further redaction. What is the task of a literary editor? I am not sure, not having been one, though there was a time, about 20 years ago, when it seemed that I might take over the book pages of the Times or the Sunday Times or some such paper \u2013 certainly not the Daily Mirror or the News of the World. This would have been a full-time job, and I regard my full-time job as providing material for literary editors to hand over to reviewers. The task is a typical newspaper one of turning books into a kind of news. Of the millions of events that happen daily, some are more newsworthy than others \u2014 man bites dog, and so on. And so some books are more newsworthy than others. There was once a Victorian study of urban drainage in Eccles properly called Odour of Sanctity whose title suggested it might be news, but good literary editors are never tricked by titles. If there are millions of events, there are also millions of books, or so it seems. Choice of the newsworthy entails more skill than the average newspaper reader can easily imagine. For the average reader cannot imagine the immense number of books that are published until he has actually handled them. In the 1960s I was shocked to discover how many novels are published in a year. This was when I was given the job of fiction editor for the Yorkshire Post, a very reputable journal, much read in the dales and the clubs of wool and steel magnates. I had to furnish a fortnightly article in which five or six new books had to be given serious treatment and, in a kind of coda, 10 or so others granted a phrasal summation \u2014 like 'All too putdo wnable' or, rather ambiguous, 'For insomniacs', or 'India encapsulated in a poppadom' or 'Sex on Ilkley Moor \u2014 baht more than 'at'. When the stint began, in the January of 1960, I felt that it might be easy enough, for few novels arrived. I had forgotten that the New Year was always a slack time for publishing. As the year burgeoned, so did fiction. I was living in a small Sussex village, and extra staff had to be taken on at the local post office to cope with the flood. The pay for the fortnightly article was very small \u2014 \u00a36 in pre-decimal money \u2014 but the incidental rewards were considerable. Every other Monday morning I staggered to the local railway station, weighed down with two suitcases full of new fiction. The villagers, whose memories were short, assumed on each occasion that I was leaving my wife. These suitcases were emptied on to the floor of the back room of Louis Simmonds, a bookseller on the Strand. He paid 50% of the sale price of each book, in crisp new notes. This was non-taxable cash, and my walk back to Charing Cross Station was usually an irregular one. The sale of review copies remains a source of income for hacks: they would be lost without it. Some really indigent hacks \u2014 I could name names but I won't \u2014 have in their time sold their review copies without reading them, need being so great. The publisher's blurb grants enough information for processing into a cautious notice. When a review is totally laudatory, lacking in \"nevertheless\", you may assume that the book has not been read by the reviewer. My discovery of the vast number of novels published in Britain alone was, to me, disconcerting because I was trying to make a primary living out of adding to that number. The competition made my heart fail. And yet there were times when my heart lifted. For so many of the novels submitted for review were of a badness hardly credible. Yet they had got into print. Did aesthetic judgments truly operate in publishing houses? Nobody properly knows. Given, in the batch for reviewing, a new novel by Greene or Waugh or Powell or Amis, I knew what had to be done, but there was always the possibility of some new genius turning up. One did not dare neglect anything, though there had been glaring examples of neglect in the annals of literary editorship. VS Naipaul told me that his first novel, now considered a classic, had not received a single review. My fourth novel failed to be noticed in several of the upmarket Sundays, and I assumed this was a conspiracy, which it probably was. If you examine the archives of the now defunct magazine Punch for 1922, you will find reviews of Sheila Kaye-Smith and Ethel Mannin, but none of Ulysses or The Waste Land. In 1939 there were hardly any reviews of Finnegans Wake, though the late Malcolm Muggeridge contributed a manifesto of total bewilderment to I forget what paper. Total bewilderment was not in order. Finnegans Wake had been appearing in pamphlets under the general title of Work in Progress all through the 1930s, and there were learned articles of exegesis around. But statements like \"I find this a mass of total gibberish\" are often excused in a mere reviewer. The situation is different for a critic. Indeed, it is highly exceptional for a reviewer to behave like a critic, though, with the heavier periodicals that no longer exist, the two vocations could be regarded as identical. We have TS Eliot's volume of Selected Essays, which were nothing but reviews reprinted from his magazine the Criterion. When I was an undergraduate, this tome, along with William Empson's Seven Types of Ambiguity, was a vade mecum. Being by Eliot, it was assumed to be reliable. In it were definitive judgments on Marlowe, Shakespeare's Hamlet, the influence of Seneca on the Elizabethans, the Metaphysical poets. Some of the summations have, over the years, proved to be of very dubious validity. For instance, Eliot said that the Elizabethans took the five-act division from Seneca. But Seneca's plays had no act divison; they were more likely to take it from Plautus. The epigrammatic serves well in a review but not in a critical essay. Marlowe's genius was presented as comic in the sense that it went back to some ancient dark native tradition, but of this tradition we were never told, nor could we ever find it. Hamlet presented the problem of an emotion being in excess of any possible cause, and we still puzzle over what precisely Eliot meant. The trouble always was that Eliot could do no wrong. In his poem \"Gerontion\" he uses the phrase \"In the juvescence of the year/ Came Christ the tiger'. \"Juvescence\" is wrong; it should be \"juvenescence\", but Eliot would not be told. That solecism is in the Oxford English Dictionary and it has to be taken as an authentic form. I have been frequently whipped for whipping Eliot. In the early days of reviewing, the days of the Edinburgh Review, despite the immense length of articles which granted the space and time for genuine critical exposition, the tradition of insufficient thought and attention and, more than that, the transmissible disease of waspishness and sheer malice seems to have been fully established. As Byron put it: John Keats, who was killed off by one critique, Just as he really promised something great, If not intelligible, \u2013 without Greek Contrived to talk about the gods of late Much as they might have been supposed to speak. P oor fellow! His was an untoward fate: \u2013 'Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle, Should let itself be snuffed out by an article. It is doubtful if any writer was ever so snuffed out. A bad, meaning thoughtless, review can induce deep depression and sometimes a silence, which in a sense is death, in sensitive authors. This happened to the playwright Christopher Fry, who gave up producing verse plays when consistently attacked by malicious reviewers. One must, I suppose, ponder a little on that term \"malice\", since it is doubtful if it can arise from the mere close perusal of a text. A text is not a person, though it may exhibit some facets of a personality. Reviewers prefer the personality for their target, not a text, and this relates them to their colleagues in the gossip columns. I still smart from a review excreted by the late Geoffrey Grigson. In noticing a volume of essays I had published, he said: 'Who could possibly like so coarse and unattractive a character?' This, I think, was unjust and impertinent. Unfortunately, it is the sort of thing that the baser literary editors prefer to the impersonal weighing up of a text. Terry Kilmartin was not one of these base promoters of malice. When he made mistakes it was rarely in the region of confusing gossip with serious, or semi-serious, appraisal of literary artefacts. He was balanced, and he did not even commit errors of taste, except on one occasion, when he headlined a review of a book on the position of women in the Roman Empire with \"Lays of Ancient Rome\". With myself he made an error of judgment which still hurts a little. This sprang out of my own error of judgment when reviewing for the Yorkshire Post. I had become somewhat uneasy about throwing my reviews into what seemed like a great silence. Readers never responded to my reviews. I received only one letter from a Yorkshire Post reader, and that was a horticultural lady who responded to my incidental statement that British orchids had no smell. \"They do, you know,\" she wrote, and instanced many odorous varieties. This had nothing at all to do with literature. I got into the habit of throwing untenable judgments at my presumed readers, saying, for instance, that Barbara Cartland was much influenced by Molly Bloom's monologue at the end of Ulysses, or that one could descry the impact of DH Lawrence on Charles Dickens. Angry at the unangry silences, I determined to arouse some interest by reviewing a book of my own. There was a precedent for this: Walter Scott had reviewed Waverley at great length in the Edinburgh Review and had not been trounced for it. There is something to be said for allowing a novelist to notice his own novel: he knows its faults better than any casual reader, and he has at least read the book. I published a novel entitled Inside Mr Enderby, which I'd issued under a pseudonym, and I reviewed this at some length in the Yorkshire Post, pointing out how obscene, how fundamentally unclean the work was, and warning readers against reading it. A gossip columnist in the Daily Mail picked up my act of immoral import and gleefully reported it. I was attacked by the editor of the Yorkshire Post on Yorkshire Television and promptly, and perhaps justly, dismissed. But at that same time, I'd written for the Observer an article appraising new books by VS Naipaul, Iris Murdoch and Brigid Brophy. This could not be published, since I was now untrustworthy and might conceivably be all these authors, and more, masquerading under the name Anthony Burgess, a name that was itself a masquerade. This tremor of distrust was not typical of Terry Kilmartin. The distrust, anyway, did not last. Journalists are quickly forgiven, and this may be taken as one of the signs of the essential ephemerality of journalism. As a character in Ulysses says, \"Sufficient unto the day is the newspaper thereof.\" But to return to this theme of malice. In his essay on the reviewer, Orwell made a very astute remark, to the effect that most books make no impression at all on the reviewer, and hence an attitude to the book must be contrived. One must fabricate a feeling towards something that arouses no feeling. Hence the conjuring of an attitude towards the author her or himself which, since the book has wasted one's time, might as well be one of malice. I personally show malice very rarely; my general attitude towards any book, however bad, is one of vague sympathy. As one who writes books himself, I know how much hard work goes into authorship; hence the sympathy, which is probably not good journalism. But I can well understand why some reviewers develop an attitude, when given a book which they may not well understand or become bored with reading. I published a novel about contemporary Russia at the time of my disgrace, and this was reviewed at some length in the New Statesman \u2013 I will not say by whom \u2013 and considered as a literary demonstration of my homosexuality. In those days it was still a crime to be homosexual, but I do not think that malice motivated my reviewer \u2013 perhaps rather the opposite, indicating the reviewer's sexual tropism. Perhaps, perhaps not. This review came at a very opportune time. People rarely fall in love with me, or fell at the time when I was young enough to be fallable in love with. But at this time a lady dentist had interpreted, much in the manner of Katisha in The Mikado, my affability, a natural attitude to a dentist, as lovability, meaning a willingness to engage in an adulterous relationship. She proposed that we make love in her surgery, using the dentist's chair, and for all I knew various surgical instruments, as adjuncts to the act. It was very difficult to demur, since I was engaged in a fairly lengthy course of NHS treatment. But my lady dentist regularly read the New Statesman, and thus she discovered from the aforementioned review that I was homosexual. I was able to tell her that I had fought against this aspect of my personality but without success. She understood, or professed to, and the dental surgery retained its clinical purity. This was the only time when a review proved useful, indeed salvatory. I never had to prove homosexuality, which would have been difficult for one who is boringly normal. I offer this anecdote to prove nothing. Nobody really understands why reviews do so little for books, while theatrical notices can, at least in New York, make or break a play. There was a time when Arnold Bennett could promote high success with a review in the Evening Standard. This has not happened since his day. The quite incredible success of A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking owes nothing to its reviews, though much to the newsworthiness of his physical condition. Its unintelligibility \u2013 as well as the physical condition of its author \u2013 is certainly a factor in its high sales record. Because, and this is particularly true in America, if a book is not easy to read it becomes a part of the furniture: the money paid out for it has not been wasted on an ephemeral and enjoyable object. TS Eliot said that a genuine writer should give up reviewing at the age of 35, nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita. This entails, presumably, relegating the craft to the young and ill-read, the trendy, the alternative comedian. It is because of the pain that ignorance causes that some of us keep on with the work of reviewing even in old age. Of course, old age means forgetfulness, which looks very much like ignorance. But it is through being reviewed that one learns how much ignorance resides in the reviewer. And along with ignorance, carelessness. When in 1960 I produced a novel that dealt with London's underclass, I was rebuked by a young Oxonian reviewer for using the term \"kinky\" \u2014 terribly old-fashioned. In fact, during the time of erotic leather gear, the word was coming back and I was a little before the trend. These annoyances are mere gnat-bites, but a multiplicity of gnat-bites feels like the onset of malaria. Let us go back to the ringmaster of the reviewing animals and clowns. How does the literary editor decide what is to be reviewed and what not? One way of answering the question is to consider a definition of literature as the arrangement of language to an aesthetic end. It is, I think, true to say that the novels of Lord Archer, Dame Barbara Cartland and the late Dame Agatha Christie do not fall into the category of literature in this sense. Such writers are sometimes praised, though distractedly by people who should know better, because they get on with the action and do not let words get in the way of it. In a sense it is quite impossible to review a novel by Frederick Forsyth, because it achieves perfectly what it sets out to do. The Fourth Protocol is perfection, as our last Prime Minister affirmed by reading it at least twice. The perfection depends on limitation. It does not dare the properties which we find, say, in William Shakespeare \u2014 complexity of character, difficulty of language, the exploitation of ambiguity. Levels don't come into it, only categories. Lord Archer belongs to Category A, Mrs Woolf to Category B. Category A tries to soft-pedal language and bring the narrative as close to the cinematic as possible. Category B regards language as a narrative character. Here is the beginning of critical wisdom, and it has to drift down to the mere reviewer. The literary editor has to contrive a balance between the needs of the lover of literature and those of the mere reader of books. Increasingly the latter establish a priority. Book reviewers ought to be read, forgotten, and then used, along with reports of trade deficits and child abuse, to light the kitchen fire. But, to their shame, they survive in bibliographical archives. American scholars make sure of that. I cherish, as I cherish chronic dyspepsia, some of the reviews of my work that have been put together by my own American bibliographer. I will cite examples of malice that are engraved on my heart, such as it is. \"Why are Mr Burgess's books so loud?\" \u2013 obviously a woman reviewer. \"It seems a pity that Mr Burgess's book is so bad\" \u2013 another. \"There is too much sex in this novel, and we are all sick of Mr Burgess's scatology.\" \"I yawned on the first page and would have yawned on the last, if I had ever reached it.\" \"Mr Burgess would write better if he wrote less.\" So it goes. Should one fight back? Hugh Walpole used to do this, engaging in a kind of fisticuffs with Rebecca West, but he always got the worst of it. He also did what, in the persona of Alroy Kear, Somerset Maugham made him do in his novel Cakes and Ale. He would write to a reviewer to say that he was sorry he did not like his latest novel, but, if he might say so, the review was so well-written and contained so much good critical sense, that he could not forbear to drop him a line to say so. He does not want to be a bore, but if the reviewer is free any day next week, he, Alroy Kear, would be honoured if he'd accept a luncheon invitation at the Savoy. As Maugham puts it, \"No one can order a luncheon like Alroy Kear, and by the time the reviewer has eaten half a dozen oysters and a cut of some baby lamb, he has also eaten his words as well. So that it is not surprising that, in his review of Alroy Kear's next book, he has found a vast improvement in all departments of his novel-writing technique.\" A writer who, in his spare time, conducts the craft of reviewing, is in a position to strike back. But to do so, as to indulge in reciprocal backscratching, is inglorious, totally unworthy. The editor of the Yorkshire Post, a year after he'd sacked me from my lucrative post of fiction reviewer, produced a book on the Balfour Declaration and the birth of the state of Israel. I reviewed this book with unqualified praise in Country Life. The author was overjoyed and rather astonished. He was grateful for my magnanimity and invited me to lunch at the Reform Club. I was able to write back that he could keep his lunch: I liked his book and continued to dislike him. This is what is known as total objectivity of approach. Books are objects, not adjuncts of personality. Objectivity of approach is a reviewer's right, privilege and duty. What he thinks of a book is something that subsists between the book and himself. Nor can he be told what to think and write. British literary editors, with, again, Terry Kilmartin as the supreme exemplar, are admirably disinterested in this respect. The New York Times sent me a rather boring spy novel by John le Carr\u00e9, saying \"As a special privilege, we are prepared to allot you 2,000 words to assess what is clearly an important book.\" I sent 400 words, which was about what the novel was worth. I was regarded as insulting the literary editor's taste and acumen: the author himself, of course, did not matter. No, if one is to continue with the detestable craft of reviewing, detestable but necessary, one must maintain integrity. A book, however bad, has to be accorded sympathy, since it is so difficult a thing to produce; there is no agony like the agony of writing badly. The good literary editor appreciates this, and it is a good thing for him to be confronted daily with the worse agony of trying to write well, or at least translate well. Terry Kilmartin, giving us Marcel Proust for our time, was no Olympian residing above the sweat and headaches. Jorge Luis Borges liked to visualise heaven as a vast library, in which, his blindness cured, he was able to read for ever. I think that Terry, in whatever heaven has admitted him, will find less a library than a bureau, vast in extent, which daily, perhaps hourly, has new books dumped on its desks. The thrill of the new book, clean and shining, fresh from the binder, sustains both the reviewer and his master. Like the thrill of the sexual encounter, it does not last, but it can be renewed. And there is always the hope of a masterpiece. That's why we go on. Literary editors live in a world of dilemmas. Journalism lives on compromise. I give a hypothetical example of the pain of choice. Two books came to me, not in my capacity as reviewer, on the same day. One was a biography of the British film producer David Puttnam responsible, among other things, for Chariots of Fire, an Oscar-winning masterpiece. The other was the record of a symposium on the so-called bad quarto of Hamlet. I had no doubt which was the more important book. The Shakespeare scholars had come up with new facts. They had worked out what this traditionally disgraceful pirated version of Shakespeare's tragedy represented. It was a blaze of light on the dark world of scholarship. But who, among the readers of the upmarket Sunday papers, would really care? Most, having seen the film Chariots of Fire, with an easily scratchable itch of curiosity about the state of the British cinema industry, would see this biography of Puttnam, despite its being ill-written and pedestrian, as \u2013 I use quotation marks \u2013 \"relevant\". It's clearly not the responsibility of literary journalism of an unspecialist kind to deal with the arcana of Shakespeare scholarship. And yet one regrets this. In the same way, the reviewer himself must not pretend to too much learning, or use words not found in the Shorter Oxford. He may not even quote Latin. Reviewing, one is always holding back, trying not to displease too much, serving the ephemeral. I revert to this business of the plethora of books \u2014 in Aldous Huxley's novel Point Counter Point it's referred to as \"a bloody flux, like what the poor woman in the Bible had\". There are so many, and one wonders why. One reason, of course is the need to keep the book technicians occupied. I write fairly regularly for a highly prestigious Italian newspaper called Il Corriere della Sera, published by Mondadori. Visiting Mondadori's printing works, I saw a new edition of Suetonius and a new Mickey Mouse compendium \u2013 Topolino in Italy \u2013 being printed. They were on the same rolling sheet; presumably later they would be surgically split at the spine. The total indifference of the machine was what appalled. Let anything be printed so long as printing goes on. The true horror that's implicit in the plethora is the disposability of books, like so much garbage. Books have to appear, but they also have to be destroyed to make room for more books. Keeping a book in print is damnably difficult. We used to have the naive conviction that if a book had value it would keep itself alive, would defy the burners and shredders and recyclers and, being the precious life blood of a master spirit, continue to circulate and nourish the body of civilisation. But this is not so. Lord Archer's books are alive, while his superiors breathe briefly, then gasp, then perish. One of the tasks of the literate is less to conserve great books, or worthy books, than to resuscitate them. I remember some years ago, appearing on a highly elitist television programme in which passages from books were skilfully elocuted by actors and then named and allocated by a team of litterateurs. When a comic passage was read out and I did not know it, I said, for want of something better to say, \"Oh, that's from the novel Augustus Carp Esq.\" Immediately the proceedings were held up while Robert Robinson and Sir Kingsley Amis cried simultaneously: \"What, do you know that book?\" There had been a silent and secret underground of admirers. This had the effect of getting the book briefly back into print. Must we do this for AEW Ellis's The Rack \u2013 a novel, on its appearance, hailed as superior to Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain (it was about a tuberculosis sanatorium). It appeared in 1961, but not even its publishers remember it. How about the novels of Rex Warner, William Sansom, HG Wells, for that matter, which some of us urge on to a new public through laudatory prefaces? They breathe again briefly, then sink back into oblivion. Meanwhile the flux continues \u2014 biographies, accounts of life in Provence, books of herstory as opposed to history, thigh and hip books, manuals of Kurdish cookery, brief histories of time. The literary editor, faced with the daily avalanche, has to choose, and often he chooses wrong. And ultimately it doesn't matter. What we read today tomorrow we burn. At the beginning of the second world war, Louis MacNeice wrote: Die the thinkers, die the Jews All the hungry, homeless queues, Give us this day our daily news. Or, if you like, Sunday news. The procession of what, by definition, is forgettable goes on, duly forgotten. Books, being part of the news, join the polluted stream that flows into oblivion. Yet I ought to end on a less cynical note. Nothing in my life, except the love of a good woman, has been more important than books. The writer is impelled by his desire to achieve the honour of being numbered among the master spirits who have produced them. Pride and humility conjoin in the writer's life. The literary editor and his reviewers are ancillary agents of the conviction that nothing is as important as the box of organised knowledge which is acronymised into B.O.O.K. It may be a mad conviction, but it's the madness that sustained our civilisation in the past and, despite the new technologies and the homogenisation of values, is unlikely to be superseded by new modes of communication between souls, if souls may still be said to exist. We have our uses. I rest my case.",

      "body": "<p><strong> <em>The text of the following article was originally delivered as the Terence Kilmartin memorial lecture at the Dartington Ways With Words Festival.</em></strong></p> <p>Reviewers are lazy; critics are not. Reviewers are viewed by genuine writers with a mixture of foreboding and contempt. The status and, indeed, physical condition of the reviewer is summed up in a trenchant article by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeorwell\" title=\"\">George Orwell</a>. The man looks older than he is. He sits at a table covered with rubbish which he dare not disturb, for there may be a small cheque lying under it.</p> <p>He began his sub-literary career as a genuinely literary one, with high hopes, noble aspirations. But he has sunk to the condition of a hack. He has learnt the trick of reviewing anything, including books he has no hope of understanding. He earns little money and is unlikely to earn the accolade of a state award for services to literature. Services to reviewing are not recognised either at Buckingham Palace or in the office of the Prime Minister. This despicable rat, gnawing away at the fringes of literature, is only ennobled by being one of a pack kept encaged by a literary editor. Or, to exalt the animal metaphor, an also-ran of his literary editor's stable. In this image the term \"hack\" finds its proper connotation.</p> <p>Literary editors, on the whole, are respectable members of society. They are literary men in a sense that reviewers are not. If we are prepared to speak of great literary editors, we must number the late Terence Kilmartin among them. I was never a member of the salaried reviewing team that came and went at the <em>Observer</em>, but, as a freelance writer, I did what reviewing work he requested from 1960 till the year he retired \u2013 and, of course, beyond.</p> <p>Thus I knew him for about 30 years and can speak of his qualities. Terry will be remembered as a literary editor only by a comparatively narrow circle of book-lovers; his achievement as a translator ensures him a much larger public for a very long time. There was a time when we considered that the Scott Moncrieff version of <em>A La Recherche du Temps Perdu </em>was the supreme English Proust. Then Terry showed Scott Moncrieff where he had gone wrong. Terry, in my view, does not await further redaction.</p> <p>What is the task of a literary editor? I am not sure, not having been one, though there was a time, about 20 years ago, when it seemed that I might take over the book pages of the <em>Times</em> or the <em>Sunday Times </em>or some such paper \u2013 certainly not the <em>Daily Mirror </em>or the <em>News of the World</em>. This would have been a full-time job, and I regard my full-time job as providing material for literary editors to hand over to reviewers.</p> <p>The task is a typical newspaper one of turning books into a kind of news. Of the millions of events that happen daily, some are more newsworthy than others \u2014 man bites dog, and so on. And so some books are more newsworthy than others. There was once a Victorian study of urban drainage in Eccles properly called <em>Odour of Sanctity</em> whose title suggested it might be news, but good literary editors are never tricked by titles. If there are millions of events, there are also millions of books, or so it seems. Choice of the newsworthy entails more skill than the average newspaper reader can easily imagine.</p> <p>For the average reader cannot imagine the immense number of books that are published until he has actually handled them. In the 1960s I was shocked to discover how many novels are published in a year. This was when I was given the job of fiction editor for the <em>Yorkshire Post</em>, a very reputable journal, much read in the dales and the clubs of wool and steel magnates. I had to furnish a fortnightly article in which five or six new books had to be given serious treatment and, in a kind of coda, 10 or so others granted a phrasal summation \u2014 like 'All too putdo wnable' or, rather ambiguous, 'For insomniacs', or 'India encapsulated in a poppadom' or 'Sex on Ilkley Moor \u2014 baht more than 'at'. When the stint began, in the January of 1960, I felt that it might be easy enough, for few novels arrived. I had forgotten that the New Year was always a slack time for publishing. As the year burgeoned, so did fiction. I was living in a small Sussex village, and extra staff had to be taken on at the local post office to cope with the flood.</p> <p>The pay for the fortnightly article was very small \u2014 \u00a36 in pre-decimal money \u2014 but the incidental rewards were considerable. Every other Monday morning I staggered to the local railway station, weighed down with two suitcases full of new fiction. The villagers, whose memories were short, assumed on each occasion that I was leaving my wife. These suitcases were emptied on to the floor of the back room of Louis Simmonds, a bookseller on the Strand. He paid 50% of the sale price of each book, in crisp new notes. This was non-taxable cash, and my walk back to Charing Cross Station was usually an irregular one.</p> <p>The sale of review copies remains a source of income for hacks: they would be lost without it. Some really indigent hacks \u2014 I could name names but I won't \u2014 have in their time sold their review copies without reading them, need being so great. The publisher's blurb grants enough information for processing into a cautious notice. When a review is totally laudatory, lacking in \"nevertheless\", you may assume that the book has not been read by the reviewer. My discovery of the vast number of novels published in Britain alone was, to me, disconcerting because I was trying to make a primary living out of adding to that number. The competition made my heart fail. And yet there were times when my heart lifted. For so many of the novels submitted for review were of a badness hardly credible. Yet they had got into print. Did aesthetic judgments truly operate in publishing houses? Nobody properly knows.</p> <p>Given, in the batch for reviewing, a new novel by Greene or Waugh or Powell or Amis, I knew what had to be done, but there was always the possibility of some new genius turning up. One did not dare neglect anything, though there had been glaring examples of neglect in the annals of literary editorship. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/vsnaipaul\" title=\"\">VS Naipaul </a>told me that his first novel, now considered a classic, had not received a single review. My fourth novel failed to be noticed in several of the upmarket Sundays, and I assumed this was a conspiracy, which it probably was.</p> <p>If you examine the archives of the now defunct magazine<em> Punch</em> for 1922, you will find reviews of Sheila Kaye-Smith and Ethel Mannin, but none of <em>Ulysses </em>or <em>The Waste Land</em>.</p> <p>In 1939 there were hardly any reviews of <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, though the late Malcolm Muggeridge contributed a manifesto of total bewilderment to I forget what paper. Total bewilderment was not in order. <em>Finnegans Wake </em>had been appearing in pamphlets under the general title of <em>Work in Progress</em> all through the 1930s, and there were learned articles of exegesis around. But statements like \"I find this a mass of total gibberish\" are often excused in a mere reviewer. The situation is different for a critic.</p> <p>Indeed, it is highly exceptional for a reviewer to behave like a critic, though, with the heavier periodicals that no longer exist, the two vocations could be regarded as identical. We have TS Eliot's volume of <em>Selected Essays</em>, which were nothing but reviews reprinted from his magazine the <em>Criterion</em>. When I was an undergraduate, this tome, along with William Empson's <em>Seven Types of Ambiguity</em>, was a vade mecum. Being by Eliot, it was assumed to be reliable. In it were definitive judgments on Marlowe, Shakespeare's <em>Hamlet</em>, the influence of Seneca on the Elizabethans, the Metaphysical poets. Some of the summations have, over the years, proved to be of very dubious validity. For instance, Eliot said that the Elizabethans took the five-act division from Seneca. But Seneca's plays had no act divison; they were more likely to take it from Plautus. The epigrammatic serves well in a review but not in a critical essay. Marlowe's genius was presented as comic in the sense that it went back to some ancient dark native tradition, but of this tradition we were never told, nor could we ever find it. <em>Hamlet</em> presented the problem of an emotion being in excess of any possible cause, and we still puzzle over what precisely Eliot meant. The trouble always was that Eliot could do no wrong. In his poem \"Gerontion\" he uses the phrase \"In the juvescence of the year/ Came Christ the tiger'. \"Juvescence\" is wrong; it should be \"juvenescence\", but Eliot would not be told. That solecism is in the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> and it has to be taken as an authentic form. I have been frequently whipped for whipping Eliot.</p> <p>In the early days of reviewing, the days of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, despite the immense length of articles which granted the space and time for genuine critical exposition, the tradition of insufficient thought and attention and, more than that, the transmissible disease of waspishness and sheer malice seems to have been fully established. As Byron put it:</p> <p>John Keats, who was killed off by one critique,</p> <p>Just as he really promised something great,</p> <p>If not intelligible, \u2013 without Greek</p> <p>Contrived to talk about the gods of late</p> <p>Much as they might have been supposed to speak. P</p> <p>oor fellow! His was an untoward fate: \u2013</p> <p>'Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle,</p> <p>Should let itself be snuffed out by an article.</p> <p>It is doubtful if any writer was ever so snuffed out. A bad, meaning thoughtless, review can induce deep depression and sometimes a silence, which in a sense is death, in sensitive authors. This happened to the playwright <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/04/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Christopher Fry</a>, who gave up producing verse plays when consistently attacked by malicious reviewers. One must, I suppose, ponder a little on that term \"malice\", since it is doubtful if it can arise from the mere close perusal of a text. A text is not a person, though it may exhibit some facets of a personality. Reviewers prefer the personality for their target, not a text, and this relates them to their colleagues in the gossip columns.</p> <p>I still smart from a review excreted by the late Geoffrey Grigson. In noticing a volume of essays I had published, he said: 'Who could possibly like so coarse and unattractive a character?' This, I think, was unjust and impertinent. Unfortunately, it is the sort of thing that the baser literary editors prefer to the impersonal weighing up of a text.</p> <p>Terry Kilmartin was not one of these base promoters of malice. When he made mistakes it was rarely in the region of confusing gossip with serious, or semi-serious, appraisal of literary artefacts. He was balanced, and he did not even commit errors of taste, except on one occasion, when he headlined a review of a book on the position of women in the Roman Empire with \"Lays of Ancient Rome\".</p> <p>With myself he made an error of judgment which still hurts a little. This sprang out of my own error of judgment when reviewing for the <em>Yorkshire Post.</em> I had become somewhat uneasy about throwing my reviews into what seemed like a great silence. Readers never responded to my reviews. I received only one letter from a<em> Yorkshire Post</em> reader, and that was a horticultural lady who responded to my incidental statement that British orchids had no smell. \"They do, you know,\" she wrote, and instanced many odorous varieties.</p> <p>This had nothing at all to do with literature. I got into the habit of throwing untenable judgments at my presumed readers, saying, for instance, that Barbara Cartland was much influenced by Molly Bloom's monologue at the end of <em>Ulysses</em>, or that one could descry the impact of DH Lawrence on Charles Dickens. Angry at the unangry silences, I determined to arouse some interest by reviewing a book of my own.</p> <p>There was a precedent for this: Walter Scott had reviewed <em>Waverley</em> at great length in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> and had not been trounced for it. There is something to be said for allowing a novelist to notice his own novel: he knows its faults better than any casual reader, and he has at least read the book. I published a novel entitled <em>Inside Mr Enderby</em>, which I'd issued under a pseudonym, and I reviewed this at some length in the <em>Yorkshire Post</em>, pointing out how obscene, how fundamentally unclean the work was, and warning readers against reading it.</p> <p>A gossip columnist in the<em> Daily Mail </em>picked up my act of immoral import and gleefully reported it. I was attacked by the editor of the <em>Yorkshire Post</em> on Yorkshire Television and promptly, and perhaps justly, dismissed. But at that same time, I'd written for the<em> Observer</em> an article appraising new books by VS Naipaul, Iris Murdoch and Brigid Brophy. This could not be published, since I was now untrustworthy and might conceivably be all these authors, and more, masquerading under the name Anthony Burgess, a name that was itself a masquerade. This tremor of distrust was not typical of Terry Kilmartin. The distrust, anyway, did not last. Journalists are quickly forgiven, and this may be taken as one of the signs of the essential ephemerality of journalism. As a character in <em>Ulysses</em> says, \"Sufficient unto the day is the newspaper thereof.\"</p> <p>But to return to this theme of malice. In his essay on the reviewer, Orwell made a very astute remark, to the effect that most books make no impression at all on the reviewer, and hence an attitude to the book must be contrived. One must fabricate a feeling towards something that arouses no feeling. Hence the conjuring of an attitude towards the author her or himself which, since the book has wasted one's time, might as well be one of malice. I personally show malice very rarely; my general attitude towards any book, however bad, is one of vague sympathy. As one who writes books himself, I know how much hard work goes into authorship; hence the sympathy, which is probably not good journalism. But I can well understand why some reviewers develop an attitude, when given a book which they may not well understand or become bored with reading.</p> <p>I published a novel about contemporary Russia at the time of my disgrace, and this was reviewed at some length in the <em>New Statesman</em> \u2013 I will not say by whom \u2013 and considered as a literary demonstration of my homosexuality. In those days it was still a crime to be homosexual, but I do not think that malice motivated my reviewer \u2013 perhaps rather the opposite, indicating the reviewer's sexual tropism. Perhaps, perhaps not.</p> <p>This review came at a very opportune time. People rarely fall in love with me, or fell at the time when I was young enough to be fallable in love with. But at this time a lady dentist had interpreted, much in the manner of Katisha in <em>The Mikado</em>, my affability, a natural attitude to a dentist, as lovability, meaning a willingness to engage in an adulterous relationship. She proposed that we make love in her surgery, using the dentist's chair, and for all I knew various surgical instruments, as adjuncts to the act. It was very difficult to demur, since I was engaged in a fairly lengthy course of NHS treatment.</p> <p>But my lady dentist regularly read the <em>New Statesman</em>, and thus she discovered from the aforementioned review that I was homosexual. I was able to tell her that I had fought against this aspect of my personality but without success. She understood, or professed to, and the dental surgery retained its clinical purity. This was the only time when a review proved useful, indeed salvatory. I never had to prove homosexuality, which would have been difficult for one who is boringly normal. I offer this anecdote to prove nothing.</p> <p>Nobody really understands why reviews do so little for books, while theatrical notices can, at least in New York, make or break a play. There was a time when Arnold Bennett could promote high success with a review in the <em>Evening Standard</em>. This has not happened since his day. The quite incredible success of <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking owes nothing to its reviews, though much to the newsworthiness of his physical condition. Its unintelligibility \u2013 as well as the physical condition of its author \u2013 is certainly a factor in its high sales record. Because, and this is particularly true in America, if a book is not easy to read it becomes a part of the furniture: the money paid out for it has not been wasted on an ephemeral and enjoyable object. TS Eliot said that a genuine writer should give up reviewing at the age of 35, <em>nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</em>. This entails, presumably, relegating the craft to the young and ill-read, the trendy, the alternative comedian. It is because of the pain that ignorance causes that some of us keep on with the work of reviewing even in old age.</p> <p>Of course, old age means forgetfulness, which looks very much like ignorance. But it is through being reviewed that one learns how much ignorance resides in the reviewer. And along with ignorance, carelessness.</p> <p>When in 1960 I produced a novel that dealt with London's underclass, I was rebuked by a young Oxonian reviewer for using the term \"kinky\" \u2014 terribly old-fashioned. In fact, during the time of erotic leather gear, the word was coming back and I was a little before the trend. These annoyances are mere gnat-bites, but a multiplicity of gnat-bites feels like the onset of malaria.</p> <p>Let us go back to the ringmaster of the reviewing animals and clowns. How does the literary editor decide what is to be reviewed and what not? One way of answering the question is to consider a definition of literature as the arrangement of language to an aesthetic end. It is, I think, true to say that the novels of Lord Archer, Dame Barbara Cartland and the late Dame Agatha Christie do not fall into the category of literature in this sense. Such writers are sometimes praised, though distractedly by people who should know better, because they get on with the action and do not let words get in the way of it.</p> <p>In a sense it is quite impossible to review a novel by Frederick Forsyth, because it achieves perfectly what it sets out to do. <em>The Fourth Protocol</em> is perfection, as our last Prime Minister affirmed by reading it at least twice. The perfection depends on limitation. It does not dare the properties which we find, say, in William Shakespeare \u2014 complexity of character, difficulty of language, the exploitation of ambiguity.</p> <p>Levels don't come into it, only categories. Lord Archer belongs to Category A, Mrs Woolf to Category B. Category A tries to soft-pedal language and bring the narrative as close to the cinematic as possible. Category B regards language as a narrative character. Here is the beginning of critical wisdom, and it has to drift down to the mere reviewer. The literary editor has to contrive a balance between the needs of the lover of literature and those of the mere reader of books. Increasingly the latter establish a priority.</p> <p>Book reviewers ought to be read, forgotten, and then used, along with reports of trade deficits and child abuse, to light the kitchen fire. But, to their shame, they survive in bibliographical archives. American scholars make sure of that. I cherish, as I cherish chronic dyspepsia, some of the reviews of my work that have been put together by my own American bibliographer. I will cite examples of malice that are engraved on my heart, such as it is. \"Why are Mr Burgess's books so loud?\" \u2013 obviously a woman reviewer. \"It seems a pity that Mr Burgess's book is so bad\" \u2013 another. \"There is too much sex in this novel, and we are all sick of Mr Burgess's scatology.\" \"I yawned on the first page and would have yawned on the last, if I had ever reached it.\" \"Mr Burgess would write better if he wrote less.\" So it goes.</p> <p>Should one fight back? Hugh Walpole used to do this, engaging in a kind of fisticuffs with Rebecca West, but he always got the worst of it. He also did what, in the persona of Alroy Kear, Somerset Maugham made him do in his novel <em>Cakes and Ale</em>. He would write to a reviewer to say that he was sorry he did not like his latest novel, but, if he might say so, the review was so well-written and contained so much good critical sense, that he could not forbear to drop him a line to say so. He does not want to be a bore, but if the reviewer is free any day next week, he, Alroy Kear, would be honoured if he'd accept a luncheon invitation at the Savoy.</p> <p>As Maugham puts it, \"No one can order a luncheon like Alroy Kear, and by the time the reviewer has eaten half a dozen oysters and a cut of some baby lamb, he has also eaten his words as well. So that it is not surprising that, in his review of Alroy Kear's next book, he has found a vast improvement in all departments of his novel-writing technique.\"</p> <p>A writer who, in his spare time, conducts the craft of reviewing, is in a position to strike back. But to do so, as to indulge in reciprocal backscratching, is inglorious, totally unworthy. The editor of the <em>Yorkshire Post</em>, a year after he'd sacked me from my lucrative post of fiction reviewer, produced a book on the Balfour Declaration and the birth of the state of Israel. I reviewed this book with unqualified praise in <em>Country Life</em>. The author was overjoyed and rather astonished. He was grateful for my magnanimity and invited me to lunch at the Reform Club. I was able to write back that he could keep his lunch: I liked his book and continued to dislike him. This is what is known as total objectivity of approach. Books are objects, not adjuncts of personality.</p> <p>Objectivity of approach is a reviewer's right, privilege and duty. What he thinks of a book is something that subsists between the book and himself. Nor can he be told what to think and write. British literary editors, with, again, Terry Kilmartin as the supreme exemplar, are admirably disinterested in this respect. The <em>New York Times</em> sent me a rather boring spy novel by John le Carr\u00e9, saying \"As a special privilege, we are prepared to allot you 2,000 words to assess what is clearly an important book.\" I sent 400 words, which was about what the novel was worth. I was regarded as insulting the literary editor's taste and acumen: the author himself, of course, did not matter.</p> <p>No, if one is to continue with the detestable craft of reviewing, detestable but necessary, one must maintain integrity. A book, however bad, has to be accorded sympathy, since it is so difficult a thing to produce; there is no agony like the agony of writing badly. The good literary editor appreciates this, and it is a good thing for him to be confronted daily with the worse agony of trying to write well, or at least translate well.</p> <p>Terry Kilmartin, giving us Marcel Proust for our time, was no Olympian residing above the sweat and headaches. Jorge Luis Borges liked to visualise heaven as a vast library, in which, his blindness cured, he was able to read for ever. I think that Terry, in whatever heaven has admitted him, will find less a library than a bureau, vast in extent, which daily, perhaps hourly, has new books dumped on its desks. The thrill of the new book, clean and shining, fresh from the binder, sustains both the reviewer and his master. Like the thrill of the sexual encounter, it does not last, but it can be renewed. And there is always the hope of a masterpiece. That's why we go on.</p> <p>Literary editors live in a world of dilemmas. Journalism lives on compromise. I give a hypothetical example of the pain of choice. Two books came to me, not in my capacity as reviewer, on the same day. One was a biography of the British film producer David Puttnam responsible, among other things, for <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, an Oscar-winning masterpiece. The other was the record of a symposium on the so-called bad quarto of <em>Hamlet</em>. I had no doubt which was the more important book. The Shakespeare scholars had come up with new facts. They had worked out what this traditionally disgraceful pirated version of Shakespeare's tragedy represented. It was a blaze of light on the dark world of scholarship.</p> <p>But who, among the readers of the upmarket Sunday papers, would really care? Most, having seen the film <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, with an easily scratchable itch of curiosity about the state of the British cinema industry, would see this biography of Puttnam, despite its being ill-written and pedestrian, as \u2013 I use quotation marks \u2013 \"relevant\". It's clearly not the responsibility of literary journalism of an unspecialist kind to deal with the arcana of Shakespeare scholarship. And yet one regrets this.</p> <p>In the same way, the reviewer himself must not pretend to too much learning, or use words not found in the <em>Shorter Oxford</em>. He may not even quote Latin. Reviewing, one is always holding back, trying not to displease too much, serving the ephemeral.</p> <p>I revert to this business of the plethora of books \u2014 in Aldous Huxley's novel <em>Point Counter Point </em>it's referred to as \"a bloody flux, like what the poor woman in the Bible had\". There are so many, and one wonders why. One reason, of course is the need to keep the book technicians occupied. I write fairly regularly for a highly prestigious Italian newspaper called <em>Il Corriere della Sera</em>, published by Mondadori. Visiting Mondadori's printing works, I saw a new edition of Suetonius and a new Mickey Mouse compendium \u2013 Topolino in Italy \u2013 being printed. They were on the same rolling sheet; presumably later they would be surgically split at the spine. The total indifference of the machine was what appalled. Let anything be printed so long as printing goes on.</p> <p>The true horror that's implicit in the plethora is the disposability of books, like so much garbage. Books have to appear, but they also have to be destroyed to make room for more books. Keeping a book in print is damnably difficult. We used to have the naive conviction that if a book had value it would keep itself alive, would defy the burners and shredders and recyclers and, being the precious life blood of a master spirit, continue to circulate and nourish the body of civilisation. But this is not so. Lord Archer's books are alive, while his superiors breathe briefly, then gasp, then perish.</p> <p>One of the tasks of the literate is less to conserve great books, or worthy books, than to resuscitate them. I remember some years ago, appearing on a highly elitist television programme in which passages from books were skilfully elocuted by actors and then named and allocated by a team of litterateurs. When a comic passage was read out and I did not know it, I said, for want of something better to say, \"Oh, that's from the novel <em>Augustus Carp Esq</em>.\" Immediately the proceedings were held up while Robert Robinson and Sir Kingsley Amis cried simultaneously: \"What, do you know that book?\" There had been a silent and secret underground of admirers. This had the effect of getting the book briefly back into print. Must we do this for AEW Ellis's <em>The Rack</em> \u2013 a novel, on its appearance, hailed as superior to Thomas Mann's <em>The Magic Mountain</em> (it was about a tuberculosis sanatorium). It appeared in 1961, but not even its publishers remember it. How about the novels of Rex Warner, William Sansom, HG Wells, for that matter, which some of us urge on to a new public through laudatory prefaces? They breathe again briefly, then sink back into oblivion.</p> <p>Meanwhile the flux continues \u2014 biographies, accounts of life in Provence, books of herstory as opposed to history, thigh and hip books, manuals of Kurdish cookery, brief histories of time. The literary editor, faced with the daily avalanche, has to choose, and often he chooses wrong. And ultimately it doesn't matter. What we read today tomorrow we burn. At the beginning of the second world war, Louis MacNeice wrote:</p> <p>Die the thinkers, die the Jews</p> <p>All the hungry, homeless queues,</p> <p>Give us this day our daily news.</p> <p>Or, if you like, Sunday news. The procession of what, by definition, is forgettable goes on, duly forgotten. Books, being part of the news, join the polluted stream that flows into oblivion.</p> <p>Yet I ought to end on a less cynical note. Nothing in my life, except the love of a good woman, has been more important than books. The writer is impelled by his desire to achieve the honour of being numbered among the master spirits who have produced them. Pride and humility conjoin in the writer's life. The literary editor and his reviewers are ancillary agents of the conviction that nothing is as important as the box of organised knowledge which is acronymised into B.O.O.K. It may be a mad conviction, but it's the madness that sustained our civilisation in the past and, despite the new technologies and the homogenisation of values, is unlikely to be superseded by new modes of communication between souls, if souls may still be said to exist. We have our uses. I rest my case.</p>",

The website starts by presuming no prior knowledge at all, and lets you work through small exercises, slowly growing in complexity. In the spirit of the web, it's free, and some of the exercises were created by volunteers. What will I be learning? Codecademy teaches JavaScript \u2013 a language commonly used to create interactive elements in websites. Starting with addition, you work through the elements of the language, eventually allowing you to write a Blackjack game. Lessons are grouped into sections, each of which has a Q&amp;A forum where users discuss the exercises. They plan on adding lessons for Ruby, Python, HTML and CSS in the near future.

      "bodyText": "The fifth and sixth decades of human life have a bad reputation. From Terry and June to Homer Simpson, pop culture seems to tell us middle age is a time of decline: of bad outfits, flab and woozy-mindedness. After writing a book about teenagers, zoologist David Bainbridge observed that while both periods can be viewed negatively, middle age was the more interesting and subtle phase of life. \"I just couldn't believe a whole third of your life could be spent in the sort of drab deterioration everybody fears,\" he says. A learned and optimistic read, his book Middle Age: A Natural History seeks to upgrade our expectations and explain how \"middle-aged humans are the most highly evolved creatures on the planet\". Isn't there a contradiction \u2013 that we groan about middle age but in other ways we want to string it out as long as possible, before the decline of old age? Exactly. And my argument is that it is this extra phase of life that we've been given, for better or for worse. One reason we have to be positive about it is that it's fairly clear people's expectations of it do affect how they eventually experience it. People who feel they are self-motivated, that they're driving their career, feel in control of their personal life and are almost looking forward to the liberation middle age brings. They do then tend to go on and experience it much more positively. A very specific example of that is women's expectation of the menopause. Women who expect their experience of the menopause to be bad actually experience worse physical symptoms than women who don't. Expectation is everything. Do men or women deal better with middle age? Middle age is harder for women. It's not because of any particular thing, but the changes that occur in middle age affect what women think of as the things that make them feminine, much more than they affect the things that men think make them masculine and indeed do make them masculine or feminine to the opposite sex. This is due to the reproductive strategies we've evolved with. Men have always tended to seek out young women with many decades of reproductive potential ahead of them, whereas women partly select men on the basis of their track record. So unfortunately there is this asymmetry, this unfairness in how the sexes see themselves, but also in how they assess the other sex for attractiveness. You recently purchased a Lotus \u2013 a midlife crisis? I'd always wanted one really, but now I had a bit of spare cash and less shame. Also, now I can write it off as my male menopause. Another universal signifer of the midlife crisis is running off with a young girl\u2026 There's no real evidence of that. If men get divorced in middle age they do tend to hook up with someone who is younger than their original partner, but women are the same. That's not a particularly male thing. I am not convinced that there is this huge groundswell of men taking off after younger women. By definition, when you're 44, there's this pool of younger women. It's just boring arithmetic. I don't think their minds really change. Women are trying to get in on the act now, with their own midlife crises, going after younger men, buying sports cars and the like. That's partly because of the financial liberation of women, but also the other side of it is that the menopause puts women in a different position. There are all these arguments that a man will want to run off with a younger woman because she'll then produce lots more babies, but equally the argument for a woman is that time really is at a premium, so maybe it would suit them best to run off and have one last child with a genetically superior young man. Middle-aged men are thinking more for the long term, whereas women, certainly from the point of view of making babies, are thinking that time is running out.",

      "bodyText": "It was the book that changed the way many people thought about sport \u2013 and also what it meant to be a man in the late 20th century. Fever Pitch, ostensibly the story of one man's love affair with Arsenal football club, launched the career of its author, Nick Hornby, now one of the country's most popular writers, spawned a number of imitations and was turned into a film starring Colin Firth. But now, coming up to the 20th anniversary of its original publication, when it will be reissued as a Penguin Modern Classic, Hornby questions whether the youthful addiction he had for his club can still be found among today's supporters, largely because of the game's gentrification. In Fever Pitched: Twenty Years On, to be broadcast on Radio 4 tomorrow afternoon, Hornby recalls that in the 1970s he paid 15p to join the crowd in the north stand at Highbury, Arsenal's former ground in north London. Cheap tickets meant Hornby was able to feed his addiction, but now he questions whether this weekly football fix is still possible. \"You can't do that any more,\" Hornby tells the programme's presenter, John Wilson, the son of Arsenal goalkeeper Bob. \"My impression is that most kids go now [to football matches] as they would go to the theatre, a treat, something they would see three or four times a year.\" Hornby questions whether this is healthy for the long-term future of the game. \"Because of the way the Premiership is, you can sell out football grounds like that. Whether in 20 years' time these kids will still be keen to go, or whether they will want to go two or three times a year, or whether the habit will have gone, it feels as if it's going to be different.\" Some writers have suggested that, if football has moved upmarket, Hornby himself must accept responsibility for helping intellectualise the game and broaden its appeal to the middle classes. But the Cambridge-educated, home counties-born author, whose book was written partly as a result of his experiences in therapy, believes the separation of football from its working-class roots occurred long before Fever Pitch. \"My feeling is that football changed during the 1960s: England won the World Cup and George Best was a pop star,\" Hornby says. For the first time, large numbers of middle-class children were attracted to the game. \"When Fever Pitch came out, all these people were in their 30s and \u2026 they tended to be the sort of people who reviewed Fever Pitch or wrote features about it. What it looked like was that all these people were making up their allegiances to football, when in fact no one had asked them about it before.\" Arsenal itself has been gentrified. From the club's old stadium, now converted into luxury flats, Hornby spies the Arsenal Fish Bar, which used to boast pictures on its walls of the players eating fish suppers. Hornby notes that there were no more photographs once the current manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, took charge. And despite his addiction to Arsenal, Hornby appears uncomfortable that the old stadium, whose pitch has been transformed into gardens and whose famous art deco exterior still stands, is now a home to the sort of people who can afford to follow Premier League sides. At one stage in the programme he is bemused to note there is a swimming pool under where Dennis Bergkamp scored his second goal for the club and agrees that he would have been happy to see the stadium razed to the ground. It is a poignant admission by a man who remembers Highbury fondly for providing a white, middle-class boy from the suburbs with \"somewhere in particular\" to be on Saturday afternoons and the material for a new form of confessional writing lauded by everyone from academics to those the young Hornby idolised. Arsenal hero Liam Brady said: \"I think Nick in general has done the game a big favour, but potentially more than anything it's done the people who don't understand the game the biggest favour. I think understanding anybody's point of view or anybody's love or anybody's madness is always a good thing.\"",

Cheap tickets meant Hornby was able to feed his addiction, but now he questions whether this weekly football fix is still possible.</p> <p>\"You can't do that any more,\" Hornby tells the programme's presenter, John Wilson, the son of Arsenal goalkeeper Bob. \"My impression is that most kids go now [to football matches] as they would go to the theatre, a treat, something they would see three or four times a year.\"</p> <p>Hornby questions whether this is healthy for the long-term future of the game. \"Because of the way the Premiership is, you can sell out football grounds like that. Whether in 20 years' time these kids will still be keen to go, or whether they will want to go two or three times a year, or whether the habit will have gone, it feels as if it's going to be different.\"</p> <p>Some writers have suggested that, if football has moved upmarket, Hornby himself must accept responsibility for helping intellectualise the game and broaden its appeal to the middle classes. But the Cambridge-educated, home counties-born author, whose book was written partly as a result of his experiences in therapy, believes the separation of football from its working-class roots occurred long before <em>Fever Pitch</em>.</p> <p>\"My feeling is that football changed during the 1960s: England won the World Cup and George Best was a pop star,\" Hornby says.</p> <p>For the first time, large numbers of middle-class children were attracted to the game. \"When <em>Fever Pitch</em> came out, all these people were in their 30s and \u2026 they tended to be the sort of people who reviewed <em>Fever Pitch </em>or wrote features about it. What it looked like was that all these people were making up their allegiances to football, when in fact no one had asked them about it before.\"</p> <p>Arsenal itself has been gentrified. From the club's old stadium, now converted into luxury flats, Hornby spies the Arsenal Fish Bar, which used to boast pictures on its walls of the players eating fish suppers. Hornby notes that there were no more photographs once the current manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, took charge.</p> <p>And despite his addiction to Arsenal, Hornby appears uncomfortable that the old stadium, whose pitch has been transformed into gardens and whose famous art deco exterior still stands, is now a home to the sort of people who can afford to follow Premier League sides.</p> <p>At one stage in the programme he is bemused to note there is a swimming pool under where Dennis Bergkamp scored his second goal for the club and agrees that he would have been happy to see the stadium razed to the ground.</p> <p>It is a poignant admission by a man who remembers Highbury fondly for providing a white, middle-class boy from the suburbs with \"somewhere in particular\" to be on Saturday afternoons and the material for a new form of confessional writing lauded by everyone from academics to those the young Hornby idolised.</p> <p>Arsenal hero Liam Brady said: \"I think Nick in general has done the game a big favour, but potentially more than anything it's done the people who don't understand the game the biggest favour. I think understanding anybody's point of view or anybody's love or anybody's madness is always a good thing.\"</p>",

When it's announced that James Murdoch is moving back to New York to become deputy chief operating officer (and a suitably big international wig). That was the news last week, making TV news bulletins jump. But it was also the self-same news in March 2011, when young James began his long, mystic retreat from Wapping. The facts \u2013 including an empty chair at News International board meetings \u2013 were the same. Only the cover story seemed to have changed. The 2011 version was a thin tale of promotion, glory and upward mobility. James was heading back to the Avenue of the Americas as chosen son. 2012, though, is more Napoleon-in-Moscow. Is he finished as heir to anything, apart from a pile of cash and shares? The chair at BSkyB is the only real symbol worth counting there. But, meanwhile, let's not get too excited about the Murdoch hegemony any longer. Rupert, 81, can potter around reading copies of his papers for the cameras (and going to Edinburgh for talks with First Minister Salmond). But the blah about the wonder of a seven-day Sun has faded in a trice. Daughter Elisabeth can't sit on the board because the name \"Murdoch\" doesn't get shareholders jigging with glee. Lachlan is still a long, long way away in Oz. Simple bottom line, no matter how often you announce the same thing: the next CEO at News Corp won't be a Murdoch. And when Wall Street sees stocks soar at that realisation, then the next CEO but one or two (or three) won't be a Murdoch either.",

      "body": "<p>When is news about the Murdochs not really news at all? When it's announced that James Murdoch is moving back to New York to become deputy chief operating officer (and a suitably big international wig). That was the news last week, making TV news bulletins jump. But it was also the self-same news in March 2011, when young James began his long, mystic retreat from Wapping. The facts \u2013 including an empty chair at News International board meetings \u2013 were the same. Only the cover story seemed to have&#xa0;changed.</p> <p>The 2011 version was a thin tale of promotion, glory and upward mobility. James was heading back to the Avenue of the Americas as chosen son. 2012, though, is more Napoleon-in-Moscow. Is he finished as heir to anything, apart from a pile of cash and shares? The chair at BSkyB is the only real symbol worth counting there. But, meanwhile, let's not get too excited about the Murdoch hegemony any longer.</p> <p>Rupert, 81, can potter around reading copies of his papers for the cameras (and going to Edinburgh for talks with First Minister Salmond). But the blah about the wonder of a seven-day <em>Sun</em> has faded in a trice. Daughter Elisabeth can't sit on the board because the name \"Murdoch\" doesn't get shareholders jigging with glee. Lachlan is still a long, long way away in Oz.</p> <p>Simple bottom line, no matter how often you announce the same thing: the next CEO at News Corp won't be a Murdoch. And when Wall Street sees stocks soar at that realisation, then the next CEO but one or two (or three) won't be a Murdoch either.</p>",
