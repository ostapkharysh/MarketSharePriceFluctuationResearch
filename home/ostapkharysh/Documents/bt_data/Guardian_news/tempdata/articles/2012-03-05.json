The 27-year-old will be included in a 32-man elite training squad to be announced by the England coach, Steve McNamara, on Tuesday morning but will then head for Leeds to answer a charge of dangerous use of a forearm on the Bradford stand-off Ben Jeffries in the Wolves' 23-10 Super League winat Odsal on Saturday night \u2013 even though the incident was deemed worthy of no more than a caution by the match referee, Thierry Alibert. If found guilty, Bridge will be suspended for one or two matches, which would add to Warrington's problems ahead of the televised game at Leeds on Friday night, given injury concerns over Michael Monaghan and Ben Westwood, who both missed the Bradford game. McNamara is expected to call up a number of new faces who were in the England Knights development squad last season, including the Leeds centre Kallum Watkins, in addition to confirming England's fixtures through to the World Cup on home soil in the autumn of 2013. They will play two games in June and July against the Exiles team drawn from the overseas players employed in the Super League, after losing the first International Origin match at Headingley last summer. But with Australia and New Zealand refusing to play any internationals at the end of this season, England will instead face Wales and France.",

The second-row, a regular in Wales's World Cup campaign, made his comeback for Newport Gwent Dragons last weekend after more than three months out of action with a wrist injury and was immediately recalled by Wales. \"Luke is not here to make up the numbers,\" said the Wales attack coach, Rob Howley. \"He is here to be selected and it is good to have him back.

      "bodyText": "It is gamble time for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. The Arsenal manager has a choice. Does he back his rank outsider or does he quit while he can and call it a day without suffering any more damage? That is the question that ought to be at the forefront of his mind as he prepares to pick a team to take on a Milan team with a seemingly uncatchable 4-0 advantage. Yet, it seems Wenger's mind is already made up. He may value his team's chances at only 5% but that 5% is tantalising. All logic points to being protective of his best players, those who need a rest and have been feeling knocks. Only last week he was spitting feathers about Robin van Persie and Thomas Vermaelen being used by their national teams, Holland and Belgium, in the middle of a hectic schedule when they were carrying injuries. So it makes sense to be cautious, does it not? Surely the risk of losing his most influential performers for the Premier League run-in is too great with the scoreline so weighted against them? Not this time. Not when Wenger envisages the most overwhelming comeback in the history of the Champions League. It requires a turnaround that has no precedent in Europe's elite competition, yet the competitor in him cannot help but cling to the remote possibility that it can be done. \"I would not be very credible to tell you we want to score five goals and then leave Robin van Persie out,\" said Wenger. All is not lost according to the Arsenal manager but even selecting as strong a team as he can muster is a challenge. Aside from those in the danger zone in terms of their fitness, he is without a number of midfielders, starting the week with only Alex Song certainly available. Mikel Arteta is excluded after suffering concussion, Yossi Benayoun has a virus, Abou Diaby is back out for another couple of weeks at least and there is no Aaron Ramsey or Francis Coquelin to go with the long-term absence of Jack Wilshere. Tomas Rosicky is a doubt but Wenger is hopeful he can make it. \"He told me on Sunday that he will. But the medical staff are not sure. If Rosicky is not available I will be in a very difficult situation because I don't know what I can do then,\" said Wenger. The injury situation in that department, added to the need for goals, means Wenger is \"tempted\" to change formation. He may pick Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in a more central position, or top-load the team with strikers, which could be interesting one way or another. Wenger remains wary of what Milan's attack are capable of themselves. He credits Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored a hat-trick at the weekend, and Robinho for giving his team a \"torrid time\". Kevin-Prince Boateng, who did not get mentioned but was equally dangerous, is unlikely to play at the Emirates. Arsenal are keen to give a more positive impression than the shambles they portrayed at San Siro. At the time an ashen Wenger described the events as \"shocking\". Now, with some time and some positive results giving him a different perspective, Wenger admits his team were nervous in Milan. Kieran Gibbs summed up the mood when he spoke of how devastated they were by the experience. \"The whole team was quite hurt,\" said Arsenal's left-back. \"You just have to turn up. If you don't on the night with not the best performance, and also no luck, then you have no chance. This gives us a great opportunity to get a sense of pride back. You don't like to accept getting beaten 4-0 in the Champions League. We have to believe, otherwise there is no point in being here. If they can beat us 4-0, then why can't we do the same? We have to create a faultless performance.\" Although Wenger has not before overcome such odds, he did reflect on the famous game in 2004 when Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a defeated Milan 4-0 in a second leg having lost the first 4-1. \"I watched the whole game on the night,\" he said. \"Sometimes when you made a big score, the difficulty is always psychological problems. You think you just need to turn up and make sure you defend well. And the other team has nothing to lose so they just go for it. La Coru\u00f1a had some exceptional players.\" Milan's goalkeeper, Christian Abbiati, was on the bench that night. \"Milan have bad memories of that past experience against Deportivo \u2013 it's not over yet,\" he warned. Wenger maintains miracles are worth believing in. As he said: \"When you are a top-level competitor, even if statistically we have a 5% chance, what is important is that we believe that we can be in this 5%. That is what is at stake for us. Let's make sure that we do not miss out because we did not believe in it.\"",

      "bodyText": "A search of a car in which a man was shot dead by police at the weekend in Cheshire has not located any weapons, the police watchdog has said in a statement. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said that \"initial evidence\" suggested that Anthony Grainger, who died from a single gunshot wound, was hit in the chest as he sat in the driver's seat after a police officer fired through the windscreen. Two other rounds fired from a police shotgun hit the car's tyres and a CS canister was thrown into the vehicle. \"Due to the presence of CS residue in the car a full forensic examination has not yet been conducted to establish whether there are any weapons in the car,\" the IPCC said. \"This will take place in a controlled environment in the next few days. An initial visual search inside the Audi, and a search of the immediate vicinity of the car, has not located any weapons.\" IPCC investigators who were sent to the scene of the incident in a village car park in Culcheth, Cheshire on Saturday night have taken initial statements from the officer who fired the fatal shot using a Heckler and Koch MP5 carbine, the officer who was carrying the shotgun and the firearms team leader. House-to-house enquiries have been carried out in the area. Initial evidence collected suggests two police firearms were discharged during the incident, according to the watchdog, but it added that a full ballistic examination needs to be undertaken on the recovered police weapons to confirm this. An IPCC Commissioner, Naseem Malik, and the investigation team have met with Grainger's mother and partner to explain the role of the IPCC. Malik said: \"My thoughts are with Mr Grainger's family and friends at what must be an incredibly difficult time for them. Our investigation into the actions of the officers at the scene, the planning and implementation of the police operation and the reason for the deployment and discharge of firearms is progressing. There is a great deal of work still to be done including forensic examinations, ballistic tests and interviews with a number of police officers.\" \"Investigators have identified some witnesses to events but I would urge anyone who has information about the incident to come forward to assist our investigation. Any piece of information, no matter how insignificant you believe it to be, can assist us.\" An inquest into Grainger's death was opened and adjourned at Warrington Coroner's Court, pending the findings of the IPCC investigation. The inquest heard that he was born in Salford and lived in Deane Church Lane, Bolton. His occupation was given as \"odd job man\". Meanwhile, three men have appeared in court charged with conspiracy to commit robbery between 24 January and 3 March. David Totton, 33, and Robert Rimmer, 26, both from Manchester, and Joseph Travers, 27, of no fixed address, stood together in the dock for a short hearing at Manchester magistrates court. Two of the men were arrested in Culcheth on Saturday night and a third was arrested in Manchester on Sunday. They were all remanded to appear at Manchester crown court later this month. Greater Manchester police's pre-planned operation is thought to have been connected to a violent robbery two weeks ago in which a thief wearing a balaclava is alleged to have punched one shopkeeper in the face and threatened others with a machete. It emerged that Grainger had been a defendant in a multimillion-pound drugs trial that led to a juror being jailed for contempt of court. Joanne Fraill, 40, was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment last year after she admitted exchanging online messages with Grainger's co-defendant Jamie Sewart, 34, who had already been acquitted, in August 2010. Grainger was later cleared of conspiracy to supply drugs but had already admitted handling stolen cars in connection with the case and was jailed for 20 months.",

Two other rounds fired from a police shotgun hit the car's tyres and a CS canister was thrown into the vehicle.</p> <p>\"Due to the presence of CS residue in the car a full forensic examination has not yet been conducted to establish whether there are any weapons in the car,\" the IPCC said.</p> <p>\"This will take place in a controlled environment in the next few days. An initial visual search inside the Audi, and a search of the immediate vicinity of the car, has not located any weapons.\"</p> <p>IPCC investigators who were sent to the scene of the incident in a village car park in Culcheth, Cheshire on Saturday night have taken initial statements from the officer who fired the fatal shot using a Heckler and Koch MP5 carbine, the officer who was carrying the shotgun and the firearms team leader. House-to-house enquiries have been carried out in the area.</p> <p>Initial evidence collected suggests two police firearms were discharged during the incident, according to the watchdog, but it added that a full ballistic examination needs to be undertaken on the recovered police weapons to confirm this.</p> <p>An IPCC Commissioner, Naseem Malik, and the investigation team have met with Grainger's mother and partner to explain the role of the IPCC.</p> <p>Malik said: \"My thoughts are with Mr Grainger's family and friends at what must be an incredibly difficult time for them. Our investigation into the actions of the officers at the scene, the planning and implementation of the police operation and the reason for the deployment and discharge of firearms is progressing. There is a great deal of work still to be done including forensic examinations, ballistic tests and interviews with a number of police officers.\"</p> <p>\"Investigators have identified some witnesses to events but I would urge anyone who has information about the incident to come forward to assist our investigation. Any piece of information, no matter how insignificant you believe it to be, can assist us.\"</p> <p>An inquest into Grainger's death was opened and adjourned at Warrington Coroner's Court, pending the findings of the IPCC investigation.</p> <p>The inquest heard that he was born in Salford and lived in Deane Church Lane, Bolton. His occupation was given as \"odd job man\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, three men have appeared in court charged with conspiracy to commit robbery between 24 January and 3 March. David Totton, 33, and Robert Rimmer, 26, both from Manchester, and Joseph Travers, 27, of no fixed address, stood together in the dock for a short hearing at Manchester magistrates court.</p> <p>Two of the men were arrested in Culcheth on Saturday night and a third was arrested in Manchester on Sunday. They were all remanded to appear at Manchester crown court later this month.</p> <p>Greater Manchester police's pre-planned operation is thought to have been connected to a violent robbery two weeks ago in which a thief wearing a balaclava is alleged to have punched one shopkeeper in the face and threatened others with a machete.</p> <p>It emerged that Grainger had been a defendant in a multimillion-pound drugs trial that led to a juror being jailed for contempt of court. Joanne Fraill, 40, was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment last year after she admitted exchanging online messages with Grainger's co-defendant Jamie Sewart, 34, who had already been acquitted, in August 2010.</p> <p>Grainger was later cleared of conspiracy to supply drugs but had already admitted handling stolen cars in connection with the case and was jailed for 20 months.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has admitted to mistakes in delivering a legacy for grassroots sport from the London 2012 Olympics but will on Tuesday outline 10 areas it will claim show serious progress is now being made. The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, conceded successive governments were \"foolish\" to claim legacy benefits could be delivered before the Games and said Sport England's \"utterly duff measurement system\" needed to be overhauled. \"If I'm honest, the last government struggled with this and we've struggled with it,\" he said. But Robertson, who will on Tuesday open a new gymnastics centre in Bexley with the London Mayor Boris Johnson, said that taken as a whole the \"building blocks\" of the legacy story were in better shape than generally perceived. He will list 10 key components including changes to the lottery, the construction of world-class facilities, Sport England's \u00a3135m grassroots facilities investment programme, the \u00a31bn community and youth sport strategy launched late last year, the School Games project and the International Inspiration legacy programme that has reached 20m people overseas. After the Games were won in 2005 on the back of Lord Coe's promise to inspire young people to play more sport, the then Labour government promised to deliver an increase of 1m people playing more sport by 2013. The target was dropped last year after negligible progress and the government also came under fire after the ring-fenced budget for school sport was axed, with less than half later reinstated into a new School Games project. Local authority cuts added to the gloomy prognosis. But Robertson said recent plans to refocus the \u00a3250m in lottery and exchequer money invested each year through Sport England on facilities and encouraging a \"sport for life\" habit among 14- to 25-year-olds were part of a more encouraging picture. \"Governments came to this party late. We should have got on to this two or three years earlier. But if anything can turn around the supertanker, that is participation, I think we have got something here. If we can't do it with this, I'm at a loss to know what else we can try,\" Robertson told the Guardian. He said that part of the problem was that the previous government had not made it clear that 2012 should be the catalyst for the legacy and not the end point. \"2012 is not the end of the story, it's the start of one. For us to think we could start all of this and get it done by 2012 was foolish,\" Robertson said. Government is to blame for allowing people to believe this was the date by which all this should be judged. Legacy is what it says on the can. In 2012 we should start the legacy.\" Robertson said he regretted not dropping the target of getting 1m more people playing sport three or more times a week earlier and said Sport England's measurement criteria would be overhauled in the coming months. Once-a-week participation was a more sensible measurement than the three times a week measured by Sport England, he said.\"The survey will stay but it will measure against a more realistic target and in a different way. Those fixed-line telephone surveys have got to go.\"Robertson said that he was confident that, despite the upheaval in school sport provision that amounted a cut of more than 50% in the ring fenced budget, the government's new strategy would lead to an increase in the number of young people playing sport. \"You could say we're moving to a more continental attitude of trying to do it, moving out of schools and into clubs. We'll have to wait five years to see, but there is the bones of a system here that is going to work,\" he said. Robertson, shadow sports minister since 2004 then sports and Olympics minister from 2010, also urged perspective in evaluating the legacy of the Games and said it should be remembered how far British sport had come. \"We've all been very guilty of forgetting the starting point in 2000. The backdrop in those days was not a happy one. You had Wembley, you had this colossal national embarrassment of having to hand back the world athletics championships,\" he said. \"On the pitch, British sport was not in great shape. We were in a bit of a mess back then. Compare and contrast that with now and we're in a radically better place. This has been a gradual improvement since 2005. We're in danger of forgetting how bad it was.\"",

      "bodyText": "What is it that first attracts a manager to work for the multi-billionaire Roman Abramovich at Chelsea? It cannot be the owner's laid-back attitude to the terms of a contract once results turn bad. Nor, perhaps, is it the caring and sharing vibe among the players in the dressing-room. It is possible, if a little unfair, to paint Chelsea as a club overrun by ruthless egomaniacs. The clue, of course, is in the question. Abramovich's fortune is estimated at $13.4bn and, when managers sign up, they have come to expect a certain leverage, over and above their handsome wage packets. Put simply, they believe that serious transfer market clout will be theirs. Thanks to Abramovich's financial backing since his takeover in 2003, Chelsea have become serial contenders at home and in Europe. New managers imagine the dream job, cherry-picking the world's finest talent, a sort of Fantasy Football without restrictions. But, as Abramovich began the process to appoint his sixth permanent manager, after Andre Villas-Boas paid on on Sunday,in the traditional way for a failure to meet expectations, the feeling was that the sales pitch had to change. The expected big-name arrival will most likely want big money to reshape the squad in his own image. The realities of Financial Fair Play, however, ought to dictate otherwise. As of the 2013-14 season clubs throughout Europe must fulfil the requirement to break even on their balance sheets and the calculations will be based on financial information from the 2011-12 and 2012-13 reporting periods. There are caveats, chief among them the \"acceptable deviation\" of \u20ac45m over the first two years, and there are doubters within the game. Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, has voiced his fears about whether FFP will have real teeth. Yet Uefa's leading officials are adamant that sanctions will be taken against any club which oversteps the mark. Exclusion from the Champions League or Europa League, which would come into force in 2014-15, are their most swingeing measure. According to Chelsea's most recent accounts, released on 31 January, as the media was consumed by transfer deadline day action, the club made losses of \u00a367.7m. The numbers have not generally been helped by the recoil from Abramovich's trigger finger. When he paid \u00a313.3m last summer to secure Villas-Boas's release from Porto, it took his compensation outlay on managers hired or fired to \u00a364m in a little over four years. Villas-Boas might not enjoy a windfall settlement on the remaining term of his \u00a34.5m-a-year contract, which was scheduled to run to the summer of 2014; he is to continue to receive his weekly wage from Abramovich until he gets a new job. But if this represents an unwanted outlay, the Stamford Bridge books stand to be hit rather harder by a failure to qualify for next season's Champions League. With 11 Premier League games to play, Chelsea trail fourth-placed Arsenal by three points, with a visit to Emirates Stadium to come on 21 April. Whichever way you look at it, a summer spending splurge, of the kind that saw \u00a371m lavished on Fernando Torres and David Luiz in January of last year, is unlikely; unless, of course, Abramovich intends to raise two fingers at FFP which, again, is unlikely. Not only has the Uefa president Michel Platini promoted Abramovich as a standard bearer for FFP but the Russian has made efforts to cut costs in all areas at his club. The latest financial figures showed that losses were down while turnover reached a record \u00a3222.3m. The Torres/Luiz spend even felt like an anomaly at the time. The chairman, Bruce Buck, and the chief executive, Ron Gourlay, have spoken of their commitment to FFP and they are adamant that Chelsea will comply, although they do continue to live in the red. If one of the frustrations that Villas-Boas feels at present concerns the denial of being able to oversee the squad's renewal, the task still needs to be carried out. It might feel more urgent in the summer, when the thirty-somethings have another season in their legs. It would be difficult, though, to horse-trade with the existing players, in the hope of upgrading the squad. The veterans' values on the market have diminished. Chelsea allowed Nicolas Anelka, for example, to complete a cut-price move to Shanghai Shenhua in January while Didier Drogba could leave as a free agent in the summer. The younger players, meanwhile, represent the future and it would be counterintuitive to cash in on them. Torres remains the big imponderable but one of the many questions about him involves how sharply his price has dropped. It does not feel like a great time for a manager to come to Chelsea. Four years ago, they were a missed penalty from winning the Champions League; now, they might have to contest the Europa League. There are misgivings over recruitment policy; player power and thorny politics remain rife while highly regarded managers have fallen short. The new broom must inspire, rebuild and, above all, win. An open chequebook will not be among his weapons.",

      "bodyText": "Sven-Goran Eriksson came to mull over his past in England but it seemed as if he might also have a future here. The Chelsea job lies vacant following the dismissal of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, with the Swede in town and reminding everyone of his experience, particularly with substantial clubs. It appears that he may have considered leaving the England team and taking the Chelsea post in 2003, the year of the club's takeover by Roman Abramovich. \"I know him as a very nice man, very quiet,\" said Eriksson of the Russian. \"I met him 10 or 15 times for a cup of tea. Not spending one week with him. For me his passion is great.\" There was no suggestion that there has been any contact between the Swede and Abramovich over the current vacancy but Eriksson does have the CV of a genuine candidate. He is also familiar with the club scene in this country, even if he did not last very long at Manchester City or Leicester City. Eriksson took care to suggest that Chelsea need not be a place of torment. \"If you work for [Manchester] United, Manchester City or Chelsea today, it's about results,\" he said. \"They are huge clubs, big money, so I can understand it. Next season, for example, why can't Chelsea win the League, the Champions League, as much as United or Manchester City? If [Abramovich] needs to buy, I am sure he will.\" It is arguable that Eriksson should be considered a candidate ready to retake control of the national team for Euro 2012. The case of the obvious appointee is delicate since the FA can scarcely approach the Tottenham manager, Harry Redknapp, without being accused of disrupting a promising campaign for the club. \"If Harry takes it from the end of the season and goes into Euros, it's not a perfect situation for him because of the time,\" said Eriksson. \"If he takes the job, it would be better he does it after the Euros in the two years up to the World Cup.\" It is intriguing to witness Eriksson in this role of career adviser, particularly when the advice might indirectly advance his own case. Prior to the unsatisfactory period at Leicester that ended in dismissal, he spent 11 months with Manchester City under the then owner Thaksin Shinawatra. \"He wouldn't even speak to me,\" Eriksson said of the reaction to defeat by his otherwise convivial boss. Of late Eriksson has studied the furore around the England captaincy. \"My surprise was not Scott Parker,\" he said of the match with Holland, \"but that you had [Steven] Gerrard on the pitch,\" hinting that the latter should have had the armband. Time has moved on and the assumption that Gerrard should be the leader reminds one that the Swede's spell with England has begun to fade. Eriksson at least likes the relaxed setting of Krakow in which England will be based this summer. The contrast with the retreat favoured by Fabio Capello for the World Cup in 2010 is stark. \"Football players are professional today,\" he said, \"and I've never understood why it's a huge problem in England being in the city. If the ladies want to have a party let them party \u2013 I don't think it reflects on the players. The tournament I was at they come in the afternoon, they leave and that's it. \"It's a long time they are together and English players get bored very quickly. If you take Sweden, for years they've only stayed in the city centres and they change hotel now and then just to change the scene. They get a huge freedom. You never get questions about why the wives are there. You get less bored if you live in the city centre. You have two hours in the afternoon \u2013 go out.\" He also favours another kind of retreat. \"Fight for a winter break,\" Eriksson urged. \"You need it. That's the most important thing to reach the semi-finals. Everybody here agrees but it was a 'no' from the Premier League. 'You can't do it.' It doesn't need to be a big break. Give them seven days off. In Italy it's a law \u2013 you are not allowed to take the football players into the club for [those] seven days unless they are injured.\" Eriksson comes across now as a budding consultant on football issues. It is in some respects an easier profession than front-line management. At heart, though, he still yearns for tension, if only so he can again show how well he disguises it. There seems no pressing reason why the world should turn to him. He has the gravitas of a man above the fray. It could be a long time before an outsider like him re-enters our midst if the FA is determined to appoint native candidates as managers from now on. With his air of irony, though, Eriksson still seems an honorary Englishman.",

The Chelsea job lies vacant following the dismissal of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, with the Swede in town and reminding everyone of his experience, particularly with substantial clubs. It appears that he may have considered leaving the England team and taking the Chelsea post in 2003, the year of the club's takeover by Roman Abramovich.</p> <p>\"I know him as a very nice man, very quiet,\" said Eriksson of the Russian. \"I met him 10 or 15 times for a cup of tea.

      "bodyText": "Frank Williams was hanging around the offices of a London advertising agency one day in 1977, hoping to bump into someone who might bung him a few quid to sponsor his struggling grand prix team, when he was introduced to a chap from an airline. By the start of the following season, and after the transfer of \u00a3100,000 into his previously echoing bank account, a sticker advertising the state-owned Saudi Arabian airline was appearing on the rear wing of his Formula One car. If Frank Williams \u2013 now Sir Frank \u2013 had never done anything else, he might be credited with the initiative that unplugged the geyser of Middle Eastern oil money which has transformed the world of international sport. It came at the right time. In his wife's words, Williams had acquired a bad reputations with banks. \"He had spent 10 years bouncing cheques on people,\" she remembered many years later. \"He had even bounced them on me, which meant that mine in turn had bounced.\" Before that hundred grand came along, she had taken to stuffing threatening letters from bank managers into the backs of drawers, unopened. Luckily the new sponsorship was quite a success, with consequences none of them could have imagined. By the following year, when the Williams car won its first grand prix, they had become officially known as the Albilad-Saudi Racing Team, and a year later Alan Jones carried its colours to the world championship. Now there are grands prix in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, and considerable Arab investment in the Ferrari and McLaren teams, while outside motor racing we find oil money taking possession of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, with a World Cup to come in Qatar, plus the traditional MCC versus the county champions match being staged in Dubai, Pakistan holding their \"home\" Test matches in the Emirates, golfers taking part in the Race to Dubai, tennis players flocking to courts laid out in desert kingdoms, African runners being induced to switch nationalities in order to compete for Arab states, and so on, seemingly without end, or at least as long as the oil keeps flowing. The man whose fortuitous meeting with an airline executive could be said to have started the whole thing off will turn 70 next month, and last week he announced his decision to step down as a director of the team. He will retain his majority shareholding and the title of team principal, but other figures are taking control and his decision appears to signal the approaching end of an era. He was one of a post-war generation of men who fell in love with motor racing and saw the chance to make it their lives. He was not one of the founding fathers of Britain's renaissance, who would include Colin Chapman and Charles and John Cooper, but he was one of the next wave. They came from all sorts of backgrounds \u2013 Williams was a public schoolboy, Ron Dennis of McLaren started as a mechanic \u2013 but they were united in a mission to build on the pioneers' achievements and make them stick. A long partnership with Patrick Head, a brilliant engineer who also made a recent decision to step back from the front line, helped Williams to establish himself as a leading figure in Formula One: a master of the convoluted politics of the Ecclestone era and, as that initial Saudi coup suggested, a brilliant fund-raiser for his own team, despite enduring a hideous catastrophe along the way. This Thursday marks the 26th anniversary of the day on which, while driving a rental car away from a test session in the south of France, Williams had the accident that left him permanently paralysed from the neck down. Those unfamiliar with his personality would naturally have assumed that such a savage disability would mean the end of his career in so pressurised and competitive a sport. Those who knew him were of another opinion. Dennis famously remarked that the consequences of the accident would only serve to make him a more dangerous rival, because now all he could do with his time was to think. In her spellbinding book on their life together, published in 1991, Williams' wife Virginia recalled his words when he came around after the resulting operation and they spoke for the first time since her arrival at the hospital in Marseille. \"As I see it, Ginny,\" he said, \"I've had 40 fantastic years of life. Now I shall have another 40 years of a different kind of life.\" Amazingly, his greatest triumphs were still to come: there would be another 81 grand prix victories to add to the 22 already racked up, plus world championships for Nelson Piquet, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve to go with those previously won by Jones and Keke Rosberg, and seven further constructors' titles. Just as Lance Armstrong's seven Tour de France wins inspired cancer sufferers, so the sight of Frank Williams in the pits at a grand prix, seated in his wheelchair at the back of the garage, fierce green eyes glued to the timing screens, demonstrated that even so profound a disaster \u2013 befalling, in this instance, a man whose other love was long-distance running \u2013 does not necessarily mean the end of some kind of participation in whatever you happened to be good at before fate struck its devastating blow. richard.williams@theguardian.com twitter.com/@rwilliams1947",

      "bodyText": "There were a couple of significant lessons to be learned on a rather grey afternoon in Saint Denis. The first was that Six Nations rugby in Paris is a diminished occasion when it is staged on a Sunday. France's game against Ireland was meant to be among the tournament highlights, a f\u00eate of emotion and colour, a raucous riot of jolly green giants and swirling noise. For a number of reasons, not least a reduced number of fans from the South-west heartlands following the initial Saturday night postponement, the atmosphere was mostly akin to an accountancy seminar in La D\u00e9fense. And the second snippet of early reconnaissance as England prepare to head across the Channel to embrace their old friends? That France are eminently beatable and are not the strutting champions-elect some of us thought they might be a month ago. Maybe Sunday service is getting to them as well, neutering their joie de vivre. Maybe one or two senior players are already weary of mind following their remarkable World Cup exertions and have been ground down by their heavy club commitments. Or maybe \u2013 and this is where it gets interesting from Stuart Lancaster's perspective \u2013 they are missing their English sergeant major, Dave Ellis. The lack of snap to France's defensive line-speed, in comparison with Ireland's, was conspicuous. Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie and Julien Malzieu are big, strong runners but their work-rate off the ball at the weekend was not what it should have been. In attack they had little answer to Ireland's umbrella-shaped defence which constricted them for lengthy periods, a serious worry for Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 and his backs coach Patrice Lagisquet. Had it not been for Wesley Fofana's sense of timing and pace, a perspiring Ireland would have won rather than departed with a frustrating draw. This is not to say France are flat-track bullies. Their scrum was unshakeable all game and their lineout also went well, with Yann Maestri earning deserved morning-after headlines in L'Equipe. But all their ball and territory yielded disappointingly little, the only real sparks coming from Fofana and Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud. If Rougerie stays in the team to face the English, it will be only because of a lack of alternatives. If he goes, England will have a reconditioned midfield to probe. Either way Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc will find himself under as much pressure as Dan Parks, Tobias Botes and Rhys Priestland, victims of England's passion-killing charge-down hunters. Both France and Ireland are also developing reputations as 40-minute teams; that is to say they struggle to sustain a performance over an entire game as the Irish did so memorably against England in Dublin last year. That makes them potentially vulnerable to a team like England who, under Lancaster, are playing at a higher tempo for longer. England still have their faults but they are starting games better than Martin Johnson's side latterly did. There is also the little matter of motivation. Talk to the England players and their regard for Lancaster is genuine. He has given many a chance which had previously been denied them, something which breeds instant loyalty. The majority would love him to be installed as England's permanent head coach, with Andy Farrell and Graham Rowntree riding shotgun. They also know, regardless of what the Rugby Football Union says, that Lancaster's prospects of remaining in charge will be hugely bolstered by victory over France five months after the same opponents knocked England out of the World Cup. Admittedly Brian Ashton was jettisoned having reached a World Cup final and beaten France in the previous six months but the RFU will be on shaky ground were something similar to happen again. As things stand, it is unclear precisely when Lancaster will be interviewed for the permanent job \u2013 this Thursday is the most obvious date as his squad have a day off \u2013 but it might be wisest for him to try to delay it until next week, or even the week after. If the worst happens and England lose both their final two matches, his candidature will be undermined regardless. If they win both, Nick Mallett and anyone else lurking in the RFU shrubbery will have to interview extraordinarily well. Lancaster gave another of his off-the-record tactical briefings on Monday and, suffice to say, is still in the foothills of where he wants the side to be attack-wise. \"It's going to be a massive challenge in France but we're confident in the progress we're making,\" he said. They may just shake Parisians from their torpor this Sunday afternoon. Global Madness Andrew Hore, the New Zealander who is the chief operating officer of the Ospreys in Swansea, reckons the rugby world is missing a trick and should rip up its fixture schedules. Many of us have put forward our own proposals to improve the current situation but Hore's call for the Six Nations to be moved to August may just be the daftest call of recent times. I suspect Hore has not spent much time in Paris or Rome in August, when the summer heat drives the locals to the hills or distant beaches and everyone with a family is away on holiday. Has he ever heard of the Edinburgh Festival? Talk about roasting the golden goose which provides so much of the income for the European nations. If he really believes the tournament should be transferred to one of the busier periods of the world sporting schedule (what happens in Olympic years?), he misses its entire essence. There are ways of tweaking the calendar but shifting the Six Nations to the dog days of summer is not it. Worth watching this week Owen Farrell (England). His first start at fly-half against Wales could scarcely have gone better but it has set a precedent. How will he fare as ringmaster in a major Test in Paris behind a pack which is unlikely to be marching forwards? If he can somehow guide England to victory, the 20-year-old's fast-track apprenticeship will be complete.",

Had it not been for Wesley Fofana's sense of timing and pace, a perspiring Ireland would have won rather than departed with a frustrating draw.</p> <p>This is not to say France are flat-track bullies. Their scrum was unshakeable all game and their lineout also went well, with Yann Maestri earning deserved morning-after headlines in L'Equipe. But all their ball and territory yielded disappointingly little, the only real sparks coming from Fofana and Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud. If Rougerie stays in the team to face the English, it will be only because of a lack of alternatives. If he goes, England will have a reconditioned midfield to probe. Either way Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc will find himself under as much pressure as Dan Parks, Tobias Botes and Rhys Priestland, victims of England's passion-killing charge-down hunters.</p> <p>Both France and Ireland are also developing reputations as 40-minute teams; that is to say they struggle to sustain a performance over an entire game as the Irish did so memorably against England in Dublin last year. That makes them potentially vulnerable to a team like England who, under Lancaster, are playing at a higher tempo for longer. England still have their faults but they are starting games better than Martin Johnson's side latterly did.</p> <p>There is also the little matter of motivation. Talk to the England players and their regard for Lancaster is genuine. He has given many a chance which had previously been denied them, something which breeds instant loyalty. The majority would love him to be installed as England's permanent head coach, with Andy Farrell and Graham Rowntree riding shotgun. They also know, regardless of what the Rugby Football Union says, that Lancaster's prospects of remaining in charge will be hugely bolstered by victory over France five months after the same opponents knocked England out of the World Cup. Admittedly Brian Ashton was jettisoned having reached a World Cup final and beaten France in the previous six months but the RFU will be on shaky ground were something similar to happen again.</p> <p>As things stand, it is unclear precisely when Lancaster will be interviewed for the permanent job \u2013 this Thursday is the most obvious date as his squad have a day off \u2013 but it might be wisest for him to try to delay it until next week, or even the week after. If the worst happens and England lose both their final two matches, his candidature will be undermined regardless. If they win both, Nick Mallett and anyone else lurking in the RFU shrubbery will have to interview extraordinarily well.</p> <p>Lancaster gave another of his off-the-record tactical briefings on Monday and, suffice to say, is still in the foothills of where he wants the side to be attack-wise. \"It's going to be a massive challenge in France but we're confident in the progress we're making,\" he said. They may just shake Parisians from their torpor this Sunday afternoon.</p> <h2>Global Madness<br></h2> <p>Andrew Hore, the New Zealander who is the chief operating officer of the Ospreys in Swansea, reckons the rugby world is missing a trick and should rip up its fixture schedules. Many of us have put forward our own proposals to improve the current situation but Hore's call for the Six Nations to be moved to August may just be the daftest call of recent times. I suspect Hore has not spent much time in Paris or Rome in August, when the summer heat drives the locals to the hills or distant beaches and everyone with a family is away on holiday. Has he ever heard of the Edinburgh Festival? Talk about roasting the golden goose which provides so much of the income for the European nations. If he really believes the tournament should be transferred to one of the busier periods of the world sporting schedule (what happens in Olympic years?), he misses its entire essence. There are ways of tweaking the calendar but shifting the Six Nations to the dog days of summer is not it.</p> <h2>Worth watching this week<br></h2> <p>Owen Farrell (England). His first start at fly-half against Wales could scarcely have gone better but it has set a precedent. How will he fare as ringmaster in a major Test in Paris behind a pack which is unlikely to be marching forwards? If he can somehow guide England to victory, the 20-year-old's fast-track apprenticeship will be complete.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'Nature was our playground,\" writes Nelson Mandela in his memoir Long Walk to Freedom. \"The hills above Qunu were dotted with large smooth rocks which we transformed into our own rollercoaster. We sat on flat stones and slid down the face of the rocks. We did this until our backsides were so sore we could hardly sit down.\" Walking down the grassy slope into a breeze, I came upon it: Mandela's \"sliding stone\". The big granite boulder has an unmissable track worn smooth and shiny by his childhood sport. It is one of the rocky outcrops overlooking the bucolic valley of Qunu, where South Africa's first black president grew up and which, at 93, he still calls home. I had come here on the \"Mandela trail\" in the rolling hills of the area formerly known as the Transkei. I've previously stood in the pokey bed chamber where it is thought William Shakepeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, the grander birthplace of Winston Churchill at Blenheim Palace and the cramped abode where Stan Laurel breathed his first in Ulverston, Cumbria. Thus I could hardly neglect one of the most famous people on the planet, a man who, in South Africa, has been canonised in his own lifetime. Johannesburg alone boasts a Mandela statue in Mandela Square, a Mandela bridge, Mandela house, Mandela theatre and Mandela foundation. Indeed, if he wasn't so authentically loved, such idolatry could look North Korean. When it was recently announced that Mandela's face will replace the Big Five wild animals on the national currency, one columnist described it as \"a bit banana republic\". Have those rocky outcrops in Qunu already been carved out like Mount Rushmore? Not quite. In fact, it's all still rather low key. This is no Disney but rather a sleepy village \u2013 clinic, post office, school, matchbox houses and allotments \u2013 set in a glorious green valley that would make Wordsworth weep. Admittedly, there's a national motorway running past Mandela's peach-coloured, gated mansion, but drivers still often have to brake hard to avoid casual stray cattle (known locally as \"Transkei traffic lights\"). The \"sliding stone\" is to be found at the elegantly designed Nelson Mandela Museum \u2013 but not much else is. When I visited, there was a mildly absorbing exhibition on Mandela and one of his fellow struggle giants, chief Albert Luthuli. But there were no precious documents or objects, and a second exhibition space felt neglected and unfinished. The museum also has conference rooms, dormitories, a computer suite and a restaurant that could not muster a coffee or tea. I glimpsed one man who may or may not have been a tourist. Well, never mind. Mandela spent part of his childhood here as a herd boy practising stick fighting with other youths, but was actually born in the even smaller hamlet of Mvezo, nearly an hour's drive away on a bumpy gravel road in stupendous surroundings. The local chief in Mvezo is the former president's grandson and heir apparent, Mandla Mandela, a controversial figure accused by some of selling the future TV rights to his grandfather's funeral. On a day that a local newspaper claimed that a police warrant had been issued for his arrest on a charge of bigamy, Mandla was not to be seen. But here, in the middle of nowhere, was his \"Great Place\", a cluster of newly constructed buildings in traditional style with thatched roofs. Is there a sign, a shrine, a tour guide to show the way to Nelson Mandela's birthplace? No, but there was a security manager who says something in Xhosa. My interpreter translated for me: \"The community here loves Mandela. If you speak ill of him, they will kill you.\" And Mandela's birthplace? We were walked down a bank to a series of newly built thatched-roof rondavels. A group of workmen in overalls stopped and stared. Finally, standing opposite a kraal, or livestock enclosure, the security manager pointed to an empty rondavel that was indistinguishable from all the rest. \"That is the birthplace. No photographs.\" Alas, archaeological purists should look away now. After years in which the ruins of the original hut where Nelson Mandela was born were preserved, one day Mandla destroyed what was left of the walls and foundations and built a replica on top. Curators back at the Mandela museum were said to be heartbroken. As acts of sacrilege in South Africa go, it's hard to beat. It is rumoured that Mandla will seek to have Mandela buried here too, eventually, a move already causing anger in Qunu. \"He's a silly boy,\" one relative told me. A woman who has known the anti-apartheid hero all her life said: \"Nobody likes what Mandla is doing, but Nelson is very old and doesn't even know it. It's being done without his consent.\" Whether these remote places are ready for the onslaught of American TV crews, British newshounds and the rest of the world's media for that sad occasion, when it comes, is doubtful. Nor it is clear how Mandela-land can remain unspoiled while also attracting the tourists who currently pour money into Mandela's former home in Johannesburg or his old prison cell on Robben Island. On the first page of Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela notes that he was born in 1918, the year that marked the end of the Great War and an influenza epidemic that killed millions throughout the world. \"Mvezo, however, remains a place apart, a tiny precinct removed from the world of great events, where life was lived much as it had been for hundreds of years.\" Set among the hills, valleys and gently flowing river, much of this tranquillity remains. But one day the storm of great events will come here, too.",

With the 2011 winner, Tony Martin, missing the decisive 21-rider move, the big threat to the Briton looks set to come from the American Levi Leipheimer and his French team-mate Sylvain Chavanel. The American and the Frenchman had the bonus of seeing their Belgian team-mate Tom Boonen - the 2005 world road race champion - take the finish sprint for his fifth victory of the season. Their Omega-Pharma-Quickstep squad was numerically the strongest in the lead group which escaped when sidewinds buffeted the peloton after the feed station, some 50 miles from the finish. It was a classic stage racing moment: the route changed direction, the wind switched from being in the peloton's faces to being on their shoulders and the field split into four, with the overnight leader, Thomas Larsson of Switzerland \u2013 who had beaten Wiggins into second place by a single second in Sunday's opening time trial \u2013 in the second group, 2min 29sec behind at the finish. The Londoner thus became the first Briton to lead Paris-Nice since David Millar in 2007 and only the fifth in the race's near 80-year history. The others are all British greats: Robert Millar, Chris Boardman and Tom Simpson, who remains the only British cyclist to take the overall title, in the year of his death, 1967. The four Omega-Pharma riders in the front group \u2013 Leipheimer, Chavanel, Boonen and the Belgian Nikolas Maes \u2013 may briefly have thought about waiting for Martin, their team-mate, but Leipheimer and Chavanel had finished third and sixth behind Larsson on Sunday and were clearly better bets for a high overall placing, so the German was left behind. At the front Wiggins had only one team-mate to assist him, the Welshman Geraint Thomas, for whom the \"race to the sun\" is a brief interlude in track training for the team pursuit in the London Olympics. It was, however, the triple Olympic gold medallist who looked the strongest in the group as they sped ahead on the flat avenues into Orleans, occasionally moving a few metres clear of the rest as he made the pace, and having to slow down and wait for his companions. He sprinted ahead to win three bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint 50km from the finish and now leads Leipheimer by six seconds. Chavanel is handily placed going into the hillier stages, which culminate in Thursday's steep uphill finish at Mende in the Massif Central, while the other key challenger to make the front group is Alejandro Valverde of Spain, back from a doping ban but seemingly as strong as before.",

The Department for Culture gives the press notice the Beatles-themed headline: \"There are places I'll remember all my life\" \u2013 a line from Lennon's In My Life. Within hours, though, the not so good news as reports predict that a massive development proposed by Peel Holdings is likely to get agreement tomorrow night from Liverpool City Council. Bad because Unesco inspected the plans at the end of last year and declared itself unhappy with what is proposed. So much so, we understand, that it is contemplating stripping the city of its illustrious and hard-won title. Unthinkable. Well, Unesco giveth, Unesco taketh away. \u2022 What's happened to former Downing Street spin doctor Damian McBride since he joined the Catholic aid agency Cafod a year ago? He certainly seems to have been keeping a low profile. As Gordon Brown's spinmeister he enjoyed notable prominence until a dramatic fall from grace when he was caught sending dodgy emails. Even so, in his present incarnation he strikes one as a man who enjoys life. This is evident from a tweet on Saturday, referring to a particularly exciting evening. \"Great night, great lasagna, great celebrit telepathy with @will_blair &amp; @willtimmins \u2013 and thanks for the thoughtful offer of Rose Schloer.\" Clearly, McBride has not really got hold of the Cafod-Catholic thing, yet. Last Friday the faithful were fasting to raise funds for the aid agency. In the aftermath, did they want to know about his upmarket night on the nosh? Probably not. \u2022 Astonishment across the chancelleries of Europe, meanwhile, as Vladimir Putin pulls off his shock victory to regain the Russian presidency. His reclamation will be smooth.

      "bodyText": "Voters in ten states (Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia) cast their ballots tomorrow for the Republican nomination for president. Frontrunner Mitt Romney should win at least a plurality of states and majority of delegates up for grabs. Romney will emerge victorious in the Massachusetts, Vermont and Virginia primaries, as well as the Idaho caucus. I believe he will also take the close-fought Ohio primary and, potentially, the Alaska caucus. To understand why, let's look at the numbers. There are two methods we can use to project Tuesday's primary (not caucus) contests' popular votes. The first is to examine the polling data. In all the primary states, except for Massachusetts, polls have been conducted in the past five days. Polling accuracy this primary season has been above average, though not perfect. In Ohio, for instance, five primary polls taken over weekend show a Mitt Romney lead, two give Santorum a slight advantage, and one shows a tie. The second approach is to implement a simple linear model based on the projected share white evangelicals will make up of each state's electorate, as I did last week. So far, this primary season, the white evangelical percentage has done a fine job of explaining Mitt Romney's vote share, as compared to the conservative alternatives'. The model said Mitt Romney was favorite in Michigan, even when the polling disagreed. The problem with this procedure is that accounting for a past Romney performance is easier to do than forecasting the future Romney vote. In addition, we don't actually know what percentage white evangelicals will comprise in each state's voting population. In most previous contests this year, the evangelical percentage has been up, compared to four years ago; but Public Policy Poling is actually finding it down in Georgia, Ohio and Tennessee. The best technique may be to take a simple mean between the polling and evangelical model. In most states, the difference between the two is not great, but the evangelical prediction should provide a tiebreaker in the states that are close. Given the uncertainty about the percentage that white evangelicals will make up in each state's electorate, I've taken an average of the 2008 white evangelical proportion and the slightly higher percentage of participation seen in previous states' voting in this cycle. The evangelical model is more optimistic than the polling for Romney in Georgia (where Newt Gingrich has a home-state advantage) and in Ohio, but is more pessimistic in Oklahoma and Tennessee (the latter a potentially more moderate state than its evangelical percentage might indicate). Overall, Mitt Romney is expected to win three of the six competitive primaries and come in second in the other three. He should also win soundly in Virginia, where only Ron Paul and he are on the ballot. Translating the popular vote to delegates is a tough task. Each state has unique rules, and, as I discussed last week, thresholds make it especially difficult to predict. In Georgia, for instance, Rick Santorum is teetering on the cusp of 20% of the statewide popular vote. If he gets to 20%, he wins a proportional share of the 31 statewide delegates, but if he gets below 20%, he gets none. In caucus states, the ability to forecast is even tougher because we have no polls and no evangelical baseline. I do find comfort that my estimates line up fairly well with Larry Sabato and his team at the Crystal Ball and Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight. Most of our estimates (as indicated by the three Romney columns) are in the same ballpark. There are four differences that deserve some discussion. Georgia: My Romney delegate count is higher than both. My guess is that has little to do with Romney's projected percentage of the vote, but more to do with Santorum's. I don't think that Santorum will reach the 20% threshold mentioned above; so I award him no delegates. Without going into the statistical weeds, the non-attainment of the threshold changes the denominator math and boosts Romney's percentage of the at-large delegates. Idaho: I agree 100% with Silver that Romney will capture all of Idaho's 32 delegates. The rules on Idaho's delegate allocation are somewhat difficult to follow. Each county performs a form of instant runoff voting until one candidate takes all of a county's delegates. Then, if a candidate has won a majority of the counties in Idaho, he wins all 32 statewide delegates. About 27% of Idaho's population identifies as Mormon, and Mormons have come out in droves to vote for Romney. In states like Arizona, Nevada and Washington, Mormons have voted at between double and fives times the rate of their percentage in the statewide population in each contest. I wouldn't be shocked if they comprised 40-50% of Idaho's electorate, and they will vote nine-to-one for Romney. Ohio: My Romney delegate count is, again, higher than Sabato and Silver. I believe the difference resides in the fact that my projected Romney percentage of the vote is larger than both. I expect Romney to win Ohio by 5-7 percentage points. With a victory that large, he should take the majority of congressional districts (where three delegates are allocated winner-take-all in each of the 16 districts). In addition, he has a good shot of winning two districts that Santorum would have won, but Santorum is not on the ballot because he failed to meet the requirements. My Santorum count is driven even lower because in another five districts, he didn't file full delegate slates; so he may be out another nine delegates in these districts. Vermont: There's no good polling in Vermont, but I agree with Sabato's projection. If Romney gets over 50% (which my evangelical model says he will), he gets all 17 delegates. Even if he doesn't, he still could pick up all 17 delegates. To cause Vermont's 11 at-large delegates to be distributed proportionally among more than one candidate, Romney not only has to finish under 50%, but another candidate has to finish over 20%. Social conservative Mike Huckabee only got 14.3% of the vote in 2008, and Santorum captured less than 10% of the vote in the similarly secular New Hampshire. Ron Paul did get over 20% in New Hampshire, but he performed far worse in Vermont in 2008, at 6.6%. Despite these differences, all three delegate forecasts are in the same realm. Mine is the most giddy for Romney at 244 (out of a possible 422). Given that Romney already has a current majority of delegates at 194 (or 136, if you don't allocate technically unbound delegates based on straw-poll votes in caucuses) and looks destined to take a majority tomorrow, he is now in a very strong position on his path towards to the nomination. \u2022 This article was updated at 12pm ET (5pm UK time) on 6 March to take in a fresh poll finding in Ohio",

      "bodyText": "News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media empire that is under investigation by the FBI for possible violation of US anti-bribery laws, is no longer being advised by Mark Mendelsohn, one of the world's leading experts on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Mendelsohn was taken on by News Corp last July to head its legal team, advising the company on how to prepare for potential prosecution under the act as a result of the UK phone-hacking scandal. But the Guardian has learned that he was let go almost as soon as he was hired. Mendelsohn was brought on board by Murdoch amid the maelstrom that followed the Guardian's revelation that the News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of missing teenager Milly Dowler. His hiring by News Corp came first reported just two weeks after the Dowler story broke by one of Murdoch's own newspapers, the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper said he had been retained from Paul Weiss, the international legal firm where he has worked as a partner since leaving the justice department in 2010. Mendelsohn has consistently been reported over the past eight months to be acting as a leading legal adviser to News Corp on FCPA. However, his formal relationship with the company ended last summer, shortly after he was taken on by the firm. Under the FCPA, companies headquartered in the US, such as News Corp, are liable to prosecution if they can be shown to have engaged in bribery of officials in foreign countries for company gain. The company is facing allegations that its British newspapers, the Sun and the defunct News of the World, engaged in payments to police officers and other public officials that amounted, the Leveson inquiry heard recently, to a network of corrupted officials. Past penalties under FCPA include the record-breaking pursuit of Siemens AG that settled for $800m in 2008, and a case that was first exposed by the Guardian and led to a criminal fine of $400m in 2010 against the British arms company BAE Systems for sweeteners paid to a Saudi prince. Both those cases were prosecuted by Mendelsohn when he was heading the department of justice's fraud section between 2005 and 2010. Between those years he developed the FCPA from being a relatively minor and infrequently used law to being a powerful prosecutorial weapon. He is specifically credited as having devised the aggressive approach to enforcement of the FCPA that now threatens News Corp with massive fines and possible imprisonment of its executives. To have him on board at News Corp was considered a huge bonus for the company as it faces the rippling transatlantic consequences of the UK phone-hacking scandal. But the Guardian understands that Mendelsohn had barely begun to advise the company before he was let go. It is not clear why such a serious player in this part of the law should have been retained and then released by News Corp in such quick succession. Mendelsohn himself did not respond to questions from the Guardian, and News Corp declined comment. A source with understanding of the internal workings of News Corp said Mendelsohn's rapid departure was connected to the legal strategy put together by Joel Klein, the former head of New York City's public education system whom Murdoch has entrusted with managing the phone-hacking crisis from the company's Manhattan headquarters. When Mendelsohn was taken on, Klein simultaneously brought in the law firm Williams &amp; Connolly to act as legal firefighters, and it is possible that as roles were clarified Mendelsohn was edged out. Mike Koehler, an expert in FCPA law at Butler university, said it was plausible that there might have been an internal turf war over who took the lead in handling the company's response to the FCPA investigation. But he was surprised that Mendelsohn had come and gone so suddenly. \"The pace of the scandal was rapid-fire last July. But even so when you hire a person of the calibre of Mark Mendelsohn, who used to lead the justice department's FCPA project, and then shortly thereafter say you don't need his services \u2013 that's unusual.\" The US authorities began an investigation under the FCPA in the wake of the Milly Dowler story. The US attorney general, Eric Holder, announced he was initiating a preliminary inquiry into whether News Corp had breached the anti-bribery law last July \u2013 the same month as Mendelsohn was hired. In recent weeks the FBI is understood to have interviewed several top News Corp executives. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports that News Corp's FCPA woes have spread around the globe. The newspaper says the FBI is investigating a former Russian subsidiary called News Outdoor Russia and alleged bribes paid to local officials.",

The Ivory Coast international lost six months of his career last year, a period that included City's triumph in the FA Cup, after becoming the first player in the Premier League to give a positive drug test since Chelsea's Adrian Mutu. Tour\u00e9, who admitted taking an unspecified substance contained in water tablets he claimed were obtained from his wife, marked the one-year anniversary of his ban by appearing as a substitute in City's 2-0 defeat of Bolton on Saturday. The 30-year-old believes helping City to their first championship since 1968 would go some way to amending for the bleakest spell of his career. \"The situation is very different for me now, that's true,\" said Tour\u00e9. \"My ban started on the 3 March. I'm very happy now. I was really angry last time, but life is like that \u2013 there are hard times and good times and when the good times come you've just got to enjoy it.\" Asked if the title would ease the disappointment of his six-month ban, the defender replied: \"Yes, of course. The past is the past. We all struggle in life at a certain point. I think what happened made me a better person, a stronger person. I just realised how important that time is when you are able to play on the pitch, even for five or 10 minutes. I'm just giving 100% now every time I contribute to the team and showing as much quality as I have, to try to help the team to win the title.\" City are two points clear of Manchester United with 11 matches remaining and despite conceding the pressure will mount during the run-in, Tour\u00e9 believes Roberto Mancini has assembled a squad that compares to the Arsenal team he helped remain unbeaten en route to the 2003-04 title. Tour\u00e9 added: \"The quality is the same because we had 24 great players at Arsenal and here is the same, we also have 24 great players. Here you can change any player. David Silva didn't play [against Bolton], but we still won the game. [Sergio] Ag\u00fcero didn't play, but we still won the game. \"In our time at Arsenal it was like this. Dennis Bergkamp was on the bench, Kanu was on the bench, but we still managed to win the games. That's really important when you have a big squad like that, that you can change, give some players a rest and this can be really helpful come the end of the season.\"",

Like him, working as an author and a publisher, I talk about books, not \"content\"; and like him I believe that a publisher's job is to deliver \"story, character, style, originality, design, typography, literacy, good grammar, education, enlightenment\". I agree that most publishers aren't, by and large, venal Luddites. They are trying to publish the best books they can in a market that is undergoing its biggest change in 500 years. But change demands new ideas. And, as usual, these are coming from the periphery not the core. From start-ups such as Byliner, Box Fiction \u2013 and Unbound, the crowd-funding publishing company I founded with two other writers last June. But then the creator of Alex Rider had to go and spoil it. \"I could, of course, go it alone,\" he said. \"I could self-publish, as former Python Terry Jones did last year, through unbound.co.uk.\" Go it alone? Self-publish? Has Horowitz visited our site? Has he asked Jones or Kate Mosse, or the famously fastidious Jonathan Meades, what being published by Unbound actually involves? If he had, he would have learned that his litany of things publishers do \u2013 ie making exactingly edited, beautifully designed and imaginatively promoted books in printed and digital editions \u2013 is being performed here by people who have worked in \"proper\" publishing for decades. Then he made things even worse by quotingquoted a reviewer who had asked: \"What do they do if the writer delivers a damp squib? On the evidence, they'll publish it anyway.\" We wouldn't, of course. The irony is that a lot of people would like us to do just that. Unbound is frequently compared to the US crowd-funding site Kickstarter, which last year enabled its users to fund 27,000 projects (and recently raised a million dollars for a book project). But Kickstarter is a new way of raising money for all kinds of creative endeavours; Unbound is a new way of publishing books. And I mean publish, as in find a \"public\" for our writers. We are still performing the function of gatekeepers, but we open the gate wider by inviting readers to join us in deciding what gets published. Building a base of engaged and articulate readers as your patrons isn't a new idea. (Was Dr Johnson \"self-published\"? Or Dickens?) It enables us to give a first-time writer with a brilliant idea, like Kevin Parr, a great chance of seeing his book in print, or to sell a topical book like Peter Jukes's The Fall of the House of Murdoch when the story is actually happening, not a year later. It encourages participation, but still requires the old publishing virtues of experience, judgment and, above all, taste.",

      "bodyText": "The actor Philip Madoc, who has died aged 77 after a short illness, became one of Wales's best-known faces through playing villains and officers on television for half a century. His rich, sonorous voice was heard to marvellous effect when he took the role of King Lear in a 2007 BBC radio broadcast: it was as ideal for Shakespeare as it was for light comedy or reciting the prose of Dylan Thomas, at which he was masterly. His television work brought him four different roles in Doctor Who, but he really made his name as the vicious Huron warrior Magua in the 1971 BBC series The Last of the Mohicans. He swaggered dangerously, semi-naked, in dark body make-up, and a shaven hairstyle with mohican brush that pre-empted punk by several years. Accepting with good grace that his dark eyes and deep voice would rule him out for romantic leads, he set about playing, for instance, the SS officer in Manhunt (1970) \u2013 the LWT second world war series that set him up for stardom \u2013 with relish and great skill. He never descended into caricature. Well, almost never. He himself said his grave would carry an inscription referring to his captured German U-boat captain in a 1973 episode of Dad's Army. The scene features on every comedy highlights programme as, superciliously interrogated by Arthur Lowe's Captain Mainwaring, Madoc's tame Nazi, in peaked cap and white polo-necked sweater, whips out a notebook to make a list of his captors' names. Ian Lavender's callow Private Pike makes a witless but insolent remark from across the room. Madoc, enraged: \"Your name vil also go on zee list. Vot is eet?\" Lowe: \"Don't tell 'im, Pike.\" Madoc, immediately: \"Pike!\" (writes name on list). Although the joke comes from the old formula, \"Who wrote Beethoven's Seventh Symphony?\" it is doubly hilarious because in the previous few minutes Mainwaring has, as usual, been reasserting his complete control of the situation. Madoc was born in Merthyr Tydfil, where he attended Cyfarthfa Castle grammar school, and read classics and modern languages at Cardiff University. A natural linguist, he then went to the University of Vienna to train as an interpreter, becoming proficient in Russian \u2013 the most beautiful of languages, apart from Welsh, he always thought \u2013 German and even Albanian. But his passion for drama diverted him to Rada, where he was an older than usual student at the age of 24. This no doubt contributed to those natural assets \u2013 voice, imposing physical presence, a certain gravitas \u2013 that already marked him out for senior and authoritarian roles. Starting in rep in 1959 on a salary of \u00a38 a week, he quickly moved into television, making his screen debut in the 1961 BBC Sunday Night play Cross of Iron \u2013 as a German officer, nat\u00fcrlich. A string of early 1960s television roles called on his classical talents: Von Koren in Chekhov's The Duel; Lord Byron in Tennessee Williams's Camino Real (adapted by Hugh Leonard) with Pamela Brown and Diane Cilento; and man-about-town Charles Lomax, or \"Cholly\", in George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara, with Judi Dench and Brewster Mason. His run as a star turn in Doctor Who started with a physically unrecognisable warlord in 1969 and the Frankenstein-like Solon, creator of a monstrous \"thing\", in 1976. Madoc possessed a remarkable ability to transform his appearance; indeed this may account for the fact that, although well known, you might not always put his name to the face he had adopted, not even in Dad's Army. And of course he could play almost any nationality \u2013 notably his own, in the title role of Elaine Morgan's The Life and Times of Lloyd George (1981). He was also seen as Leon Trotsky in a film about Trotsky's daughter, Zina (1986); another German, Freddi von Flugel, in Fortunes of War (1987) with Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson; and Pierre D'Armacourt in a television series of The Bourne Identity (1988) before it became a Hollywood blockbuster. One of Madoc's most interesting characters was DCI Noel Bain in A Mind to Kill, a television detective series made simultaneously in Welsh and English between 1994 and 2002. His stage career came back into impressive focus, too, when he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company to play Professor Raat in The Blue Angel and the Duke in Measure for Measure. These productions, both directed by Trevor Nunn, opened the new Other Place in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1991, a comfortable brick building replacing the old tin shack without losing the old atmosphere. Both plays explored the tragic effects of awakening sexual obsession in a moral climate of distorted respectability; Madoc's humiliated professor was a beautifully modulated performance of a pathetic creature, while his \"duke of dark corners\" launched a long-range, cunning assault on Claire Skinner's sweet but innately priggish Isabella before coming clean with his immodest proposal. Always fit and physically adventurous, Madoc went walking in the Himalayas, camel-trekking in the Gobi desert and motor-cycling in south-east Asia. His first marriage, to the actor Ruth Madoc, ended in divorce in 1981. He is survived by his second wife, Diane, an interior designer; by the two children, Rhys and Lowri, from his first marriage; and by a younger sister. \u2022 Philip Madoc, actor, born 5 July 1934; died 5 March 2012 \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March. Manhunt was an LWT rather than a BBC series, broadcast in 1970 rather than 1969. Zina was a film rather than a mini-series. These points have been corrected.",

Britain will be represented in the sport for the first time at the London Games after an independent tribunal ruled that British Gymnastics had been wrong not to put the six-strong team forward for a home nation place. At an Olympic test event in January the rhythmic gymnastics team failed to hit the qualifying mark set by British Gymnastics to take up a place at the Games during the two-day qualifying competition, falling 0.273 marks short. But the next day during the finals they easily attained the challenging mark \u2013 set at 82% of the winning score in the world championships \u2013 and scored 47.2 with their routines. The arbitrator, Graeme Mew, ruled that, while accepting British Gymnastics had endeavoured to act in the best interests of the sport, it had been wrong to exclude the team on the basis that its qualifying criterion was unclear, a decision welcomed by the team's coach, Sarah Moon. \"We were very happy that it went to appeal, which gave us the fairest outcome. It's an amazing opportunity and it's right that we're going to be there.\" Largely self-funded, the team \u2014 Jade Faulkner, Francesca Fox, Lynne Hutchison, Louisa Pouli, Rachel Smith and Georgina Cassar \u2014 had trained for six months at the University of Bath in a bid to hit the qualifying mark. \"We did believe in our case very strongly. We thought we could get it over the three days and we got the score on the carpet within those three days,\" said Fox, who put the confusion down to \"crossed wires\". She added: \"It's such a big thing. It's a dream come true. We're so proud of where we have come from. No one thought GB would even get a group together. We've made that possible. What we've done in the last year is amazing.\" The team, whose case at the tribunal was put by Michael Beloff QC, will now focus on the European championships at the end of May before targeting the Olympic competition, which will take place at Wembley Arena. British Gymnastics's chief executive, Jane Allen, defended the selection criteria but accepted the ruling of the independent Sport Resolutions tribunal. \"We were confident that we had put in place a transparent, fair and equitable selection policy and associated qualifying score to allow a rhythmic group to self-determine their nomination to the BOA and subsequent participation in the London 2012 Olympic Games,\" she said. \"The selection policy and its associated procedures have been thoroughly examined by an independent arbitrator and we accept his ruling.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Football Association has been sounding out opinion within the game as part of its recruitment process for the next England manager, and is expected to draw up a wanted-list of \"a very small number of key people\" within a month. The four-man Club England board that is solely responsible for identifying a chosen candidate will also endeavour to ensure that all those on the final list will be willing to accept the job if asked as they look to avoid a repeat of the Luiz Felipe Scolari fiasco. The FA chairman David Bernstein, who is leading the hunt for Fabio Capello's replacement, said he did not believe the fluid job market for top quality managers would affect its ability to appoint the right man. While Harry Redknapp remains favourite for the post, others who may potentially be entering the job market include Barcelona's Pep Guardiola and Real Madrid's Jos\u00e9 Mourhino. Bernstein said the likely flurry of activity shouldn't affect the FA's bargaining position. \"This position is so unique that the right person would want to do it on a sensible basis and for the right reasons,\" said Bernstein. \"It is a very fluid situation, I am not sure if [other clubs searching for managers] helps or hinders. It depends how the cards fall.\" The FA is currently believed to have a list of less than 10 names \u2014 not all of them British \u2014 in mind for the job and has begun an intelligence-gathering process to ascertain whether they would accept the position if offered. The aim is to draw up a definitive list of a handful of candidates who have indicated that they would take the job before making an official approach. There was heavy criticism of the FA following the exit of Sven-Goran Eriksson in 2006 and their high-profile attempts to hire Scolari. The Brazilian turned down the English offer, but said he would have accepted the job had England's pursuit of him been handled better. \"We are treating this with the greatest urgency,\" said Bernstein.",

      "bodyText": "The former New Zealand and Nottinghamshire all-rounder Chris Cairns denied accusations that he had been involved in match-fixing in the rebel Indian Cricket League in 2008 on the first day of a landmark case in London's high court, where he is claiming substantial damages from the former Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi for an alleged libel on Twitter. Modi had accused Cairns of match-fixing in a tweet posted in January 2010, saying that was the explanation for his exclusion from the list for the IPL auction. The case has been described as a \"clearcut\" example of libel tourism, with Modi's lawyers claiming that the tweet was read by only 35 people in England and Wales, whereas evidence for Cairns claims a figure of up to 95. Cairns says that having lived in England when his father Lance, also a New Zealand international, played here, and then again when he was employed by Nottinghamshire, he values his reputation in this country highly. Cairns has already secured undisclosed damages from Cricinfo, the cricket website which picked up on the tweet. But Modi has declined to apologise and pleaded justification, maintaining the allegation is true. Cairns said in evidence it was \"wholly untrue\" and, if uncorrected, would destroy all he had achieved over a 20-year career with 62 Test appearances for New Zealand. \"The defendant's allegations have also had a profound effect on my personal and private life,\" he said. \"It put a strain on my marriage. It hurts that my wife may think that I am not the man she thought I was. \"It hurts me too that friends, many of whom are former cricketing foes, will question my integrity as a man and a sportsman, and that all I achieved in the great game of cricket is dust.\" Cairns was then pressed by Modi's counsel, Ronald Thwaites QC, in four hours of cross-examination, and said he was \"offended\" by suggestions that an ankle injury had been fabricated to cover up his abrupt departure as the captain of the ICL franchise Chandigarh Lions. Thwaites also questioned the 41-year-old over payments of 900,000 dirhams (about \u00a3155,000) he had received from Rough Diamond Traders, a company based in Dubai. Cairns said he had a verbal agreement to do PR work for it, having learned about the diamond trade in Antwerp. The case is being heard by Mr Justice Bean, without a jury, and is expected to last two weeks. Modi, who was suspended from his role as commissioner of the IPL in April 2010 over separate claims, has promised evidence from six Indian players who say Cairns was involved in match-fixing, and Andrew Hall, the former South Africa all-rounder and Northamptonshire captain who also played for Chandigarh Lions in the ICL, is due to be called as a witness.",

      "bodyText": "Season One 2003-04 Roman Abramovich's \u00a360m takeover of an institution with debts of around \u00a380m was accompanied by a blaze of eye-catching signings, from the likes of Damien Duff for \u00a317m to Hern\u00e1n Crespo at \u00a316.9m, as Claudio Ranieri constructed a squad aimed at challenging both domestically and in Europe. More than \u00a3110m was spent overhauling the playing staff and the second-place finish secured behind Arsenal's \"invincibles\" represented the club's best in 49 years. Indeed, their rivals were defeated at Highbury in the Champions League quarter-finals, only for Ranieri, long tagged a \"dead man walking\" as a remnant of a previous regime, to tinker too much in the semi-finals and succumb to Monaco. Abramovich duly wielded the axe and recruited Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and his entourage, as well as the Dutch scout Piet de Visser to bolster his scouting options. No honours; League position 2nd Net spend \u00a3111.6m Season Two 2004-05 A new manager instigated another overhaul of the playing squad, with Didier Drogba (\u00a324m) and Ricardo Carvalho (\u00a319.6m) among high-profile incoming transfers, with the squad given a flavour of that which had claimed the European Cup with Mourinho at Porto the previous season. The self-styled Special One's impact was immediate,, a remarkable league campaign culminating in a first title in half a century with 95 points amassed en route and only one defeat sustained. There was League Cup success as well and, while Uefa imposed a two-match ban on the manager for claims made against the referee Anders Frisk at Barcelona, the only sour note was provided by Liverpool in the semi-finals of the Champions League, where Luis Garcia's \"ghost goal\" denied Mourinho's side passage to Istanbul. Premier League and League Cup winners Net spend \u00a3103.4m Season Three 2005-06 Mourinho had secured more lucrative terms after protracted, and occasionally tortuous, negotiations and his squad was lavishly tweaked, rather than rebuilt, ahead of the new campaign with Michael Essien (\u00a324.4m) and Shaun Wright-Phillips (\u00a320.6m) the most notable arrivals. Nine consecutive league wins at the start of the season set the tone for another upbeat campaign. So dominant were Chelsea that they ended up claiming their second successive title by defeating Manchester United at Stamford Bridge in April, Mourinho hurling his medal and blazer into the crowd at the presentation ceremony. Frank Arnesen, who had been lured controversially from Tottenham for some \u00a38m in compensation, filled the role of sporting director to offer the club a semblance of structure away from Mourinho's entourage, while the club also started training at a 140-acre site in Cobham, purchased for \u00a320m, which would take two years to develop fully. Premier League winners Net spend \u00a337.6m Season Four 2006-07 The cracks that had appeared the previous season with Mourinho's mood swings steadily widened. Andriy Shevchenko's British record \u00a330m arrival from Milan was on Abramovich's whim, the Ukraine international scoring only four times in the league all season. His omission from the starting line-up was considered political, regardless of his form, and he was not even included on the bench as Chelsea again exited the Champions League at Anfield. That tested the relationship between owner and manager, and the latter was seemingly further undermined by Avram Grant's arrival as director of football. The Israeli was a friend of Abramovich's and appeared to be his stooge. Amid the back-drop of resignation threats and general discord, success in both domestic cup competitions went almost unnoticed. FA Cup and League Cup winners League position 2nd Net spend \u00a328.8m Season Five 2007-08 The summer appeared to mark a change, the manager declaring himself \"mellow Mourinho\" in pre-season and relations with the owner apparently restored. The club's transfer policy was more conservative, too, with Florent Malouda at \u00a313.5m the main arrival and free transfers adding to squad numbers. Yet it took only two months for normal service to resume, with Mourinho sacked after a relatively sloppy start to the campaign. Grant was promoted from director of football and, having been granted funds to sign Nicolas Anelka for \u00a315m, finished second, reached the League Cup final and was a penalty kick away from delivering the Champions League. Yet John Terry slipped, Anelka missed and Grant was subsequently sacked. The compensation eventually paid to Mourinho, Grant and five members of the coaching staff amounted to some \u00a323.1m. No honours; League position 2nd Net spend \u00a310.7m Season Six 2008-09 Luiz Felipe Scolari, a World Cup winner with his native Brazil in 2002 and the bane of also the bane of England's hopes while with Portugal, was appointed on a three-year deal worth around \u00a36m a season, his immediate task to persuade Frank Lampard to remain at the club amid interest from Internazionale. A new five-year contract worth around \u00a3150,000 a week was eventually agreed, with Jose Bosingwa and Deco the main arrivals and the squad actually trimmed. Yet Scolari's tenure, after a bright start, deteriorated dramatically and, by February, the board's concern at potentially missing out on Champions League qualification prompted the axe after barely seven months in the role. Compensation amounted to some \u00a312.6m. Guus Hiddink was hired until the end of the season and won the FA Cup, while Abramovich courted the Milan manager, Carlo Ancelotti. FA Cup winners; League position 3rd Profit \u00a38.8m Season Seven 2009-10 Ancelotti was unveiled on a three-year deal worth \u00a36m a season, with Yuri Zhirkov, purchased from CSKA Moscow apparently for \u00a316m, the only major arrival, John Terry secured on new terms worth over \u00a3150,000 a week and Peter Kenyon, the chief executive, a high-profile departure. A transfer ban imposed by Fifa following Ga\u00ebl Kakuta's controversial arrival from Lens served to limit the activity, with the club subsequently cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The campaign ended in a glut of goals to secure the title, and FA Cup success over Portsmouth, though Ancelotti had been hired to secure the European Cup. To that end, a loss to Mourinho's Internazionale in the knock-out phase was damaging. Premier League and FA Cup winners Net spend \u00a316m Season Eight 2010-11 Ancelotti's second season began with the release of senior players such as Joe Cole and Michael Ballack and demands from the ownership to make better use of the youth-team players recruitedat relatively substantial expense by Arnesen, though during a mid-season slump that policy was ditched in spectacular style with the signings of Fernando Torres and David Luiz for a combined \u00a373.3m. By then, faith in the Italian was on the wane. Ray Wilkins, the assistant manager, was sacked and Michael Emenalo, a former Nigeria international who had joined the club under Grant, was incorporated into the backroom staff. Defeat by Manchester United in the Champions League quarter-finals sealed the manager's fate, and he was sacked after finishing second to be placed on gardening leave until taking a position at Paris St Germain in December 2011. No honour; League position 2nd Net spend \u00a371.7m Season Nine 2011-12 It cost Abramovich \u00a313.3m to secure his primary target, the young Europa League winning coach Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas from Porto, in the summer with the new man's brief to overhaul and revitalise the playing staff. Money was spent in the market, principally on Juan Mata (\u00a323m), Raul Meireles (\u00a312m) and Gary Cahill (\u00a37m) with further funds invested in youth. Romelu Lukaku, Thibault Courtois, Kevin de Bruyne and even Oriol Romeu represented recruits for the future, though only the last bore the hallmarks of a Villas-Boas target. The others, as the Portuguese put it, were \"club signings\". Yet, predictably enough, there was resistance to attempts to move on some of the established senior players, and fall-outs with the influential Lampard and Ashley Cole undermined Villas-Boas' standing in the dressing room. Results suffered as the team failed to grasp the style of play the manager wished to impose and Chelsea have rather limped out of the top four as a result. They are now three points adrift and trailing Napoli after the first leg of their Champions League knock-out tie, a reality that prompted Abramovich, much to his own irritation, to dismiss the Portuguese 256 days into a three-year contract. The squad is still imbalanced, the entrenched senior pros still appearing to dictate policy, with the next permanent manager facing the onerous task of culling the dead wood and then creating a team of contenders. That will most likely have to be done without the lavish funding enjoyed by some of his predecessors given the imminent application of Financial Fair Play rules. Chelsea's clout in the market would suffer even more should they fail to reach the Champions League for the first time in the Abramovich era. Current league position 5th Net spend \u00a346.5m",

Guus Hiddink was hired until the end of the season and won the FA Cup, while Abramovich courted the Milan manager, Carlo Ancelotti.</p> <p>FA Cup winners; League position 3rd</p> <p>Profit \u00a38.8m</p> <h2><strong>Season Seven 2009-10</strong></h2> <p>Ancelotti was unveiled on a three-year deal worth \u00a36m a season, with Yuri Zhirkov, purchased from CSKA Moscow apparently for \u00a316m, the only major arrival, John Terry secured on new terms worth over \u00a3150,000 a week and Peter Kenyon, the chief executive, a high-profile departure. A transfer ban imposed by Fifa following Ga\u00ebl Kakuta's controversial arrival from Lens served to limit the activity, with the club subsequently cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The campaign ended in a glut of goals to secure the title, and FA Cup success over Portsmouth, though Ancelotti had been hired to secure the European Cup. To that end, a loss to Mourinho's Internazionale in the knock-out phase was damaging.</p> <p>Premier League and FA Cup winners Net spend \u00a316m</p> <h2><strong>Season Eight 2010-11</strong></h2> <p>Ancelotti's second season began with the release of senior players such as Joe Cole and Michael Ballack and demands from the ownership to make better use of the youth-team players recruitedat relatively substantial expense by Arnesen, though during a mid-season slump that policy was ditched in spectacular style with the signings of Fernando Torres and David Luiz for a combined \u00a373.3m. By then, faith in the Italian was on the wane. Ray Wilkins, the assistant manager, was sacked and Michael Emenalo, a former Nigeria international who had joined the club under Grant, was incorporated into the backroom staff. Defeat by Manchester United in the Champions League quarter-finals sealed the manager's fate, and he was sacked after finishing second to be placed on gardening leave until taking a position at Paris St Germain in December 2011.</p> <p>No honour; League position 2nd</p> <p>Net spend \u00a371.7m</p> <h2><strong>Season Nine 2011-12</strong></h2> <p>It cost Abramovich \u00a313.3m to secure his primary target, the young Europa League winning coach Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas from Porto, in the summer with the new man's brief to overhaul and revitalise the playing staff. Money was spent in the market, principally on Juan Mata (\u00a323m), Raul Meireles (\u00a312m) and Gary Cahill (\u00a37m) with further funds invested in youth. Romelu Lukaku, Thibault Courtois, Kevin de Bruyne and even Oriol Romeu represented recruits for the future, though only the last bore the hallmarks of a Villas-Boas target. The others, as the Portuguese put it, were \"club signings\". Yet, predictably enough, there was resistance to attempts to move on some of the established senior players, and fall-outs with the influential Lampard and Ashley Cole undermined Villas-Boas' standing in the dressing room. Results suffered as the team failed to grasp the style of play the manager wished to impose and Chelsea have rather limped out of the top four as a result. They are now three points adrift and trailing Napoli after the first leg of their Champions League knock-out tie, a reality that prompted Abramovich, much to his own irritation, to dismiss the Portuguese 256 days into a three-year contract. The squad is still imbalanced, the entrenched senior pros still appearing to dictate policy, with the next permanent manager facing the onerous task of culling the dead wood and then creating a team of contenders. That will most likely have to be done without the lavish funding enjoyed by some of his predecessors given the imminent application of Financial Fair Play rules. Chelsea's clout in the market would suffer even more should they fail to reach the Champions League for the first time in the Abramovich era.</p> <p>Current league position 5th</p> <p>Net spend \u00a346.5m</p>",

      "bodyText": "'I think my husband's having an affair,\" said Dirk Gently's first client of the day. \"Boring,\" the private detective replied. How refreshing, when everyone else is yielding to economic imperatives, that one man is taking a stand for the intrinsic interest of their work over its earning potential. Seconds later, Gently took the case. Principles don't pay the rent. In episode one, he was living on a diet of extra-strong mints he'd stolen from a corpse and driving an Austin Princess, the go-to motor to suggest your hero is broke, effete and zanier than Zooey Deschanel, if less utterly irritating. He hadn't paid secretary Janice for ages. \"Show him in,\" he said when the next client arrived. \"You show him in!\" Janice snarled from the front office. Why she shows up for work at all is one of the show's two mysteries. The other is why characters read the Express. That doesn't happen in reality. The next client was the cheated wife's husband. He was worried that his horoscope was coming true. That would explain why he cheated on his wife. If your horoscope read: \"You will get it on with a woman of Mediterranean appearance and good skin,\" would it be your fault if you did? Hold that thought. Never since The Avengers has there been anything so unremittingly silly on British television as Dirk Gently (BBC4). Apart from Phil and Kirstie, obviously. Dainty harpsichord music tells us we're back in an era of TV misrule, in whose glory days John Steed, Mrs Peel and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) played fast and loose with viewers' intelligences. On The Avengers once, Steed removed his bowler and told Diana Rigg he would sneak up on their foes undetected. \"I can move like a cat \u2013 in carpet slippers,\" he said proudly. I don't know if you've ever put a cat in carpet slippers (try later), but the result is no byword for stealth. Dirk Gently has a similar disregard for logic. But the twist is that, in Howard Overman's adaptation of Douglas Adams's novel, the disregard is intentional. Gently is a self-styled holistic detective. That means he uses randomness and chaos to solve cases. \"The beauty of holistic detection, Macduff,\" he disclosed, \"is that we're getting closer to solving a case when we look like we're getting further away.\" Like Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, Dirk Gently makes less sense the more you think about it. As Gently's assistant Macduff, Darren Boyd performs a virtuosic symphony of puzzlements over such a MacGuffin; he's every bit as winning as he was as an Olympic hero turned hopeless motivational speaker in the comedy 2012. As for Stephen Mangan as the eponymous hero, I'd love to see those hollow cheeks, sad eyes and floppy fringe in a straight role \u2013 Mr Darcy, Trevor Howard in a Brief Encounter remake, Sarko in The Carla Bruni Story. Viewers whose knowledge of chaos theory and quantum mechanics depends on Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park may find Gently's theorising baffling. He explained that once the husband started believing his horoscope was becoming true, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. So it wasn't the husband's fault that he had an affair. If his horoscope had told him his wife would have slapped him in the face when she found out about the Mediterranean woman with the good skin, he might have ducked. But it didn't. Why are British people stuck-up ponces? If you're going to take that tone, I shall have to ask you to leave. In Empire (BBC1), Jeremy Paxman seemed to have found an answer. Snootiness was the colonisers' defence mechanism against seduction by India's charms. In India, Britons shut themselves in bungalows and all-white clubs. How sad: the best Britons (Hindoo Stuart, Rudyard Kipling) did the opposite. I'm enjoying seeing Paxo cut loose, deploying an unexpectedly easy charm on the empire's former subjects. But he risks brushing imperial shame under the carpet. It's fine to hymn how British cities such as Leicester were revivified by Asian families ousted from Kenya in the 60s, for instance; dubious to describe Kenyan independence without reference to what Britons did to Mau Mau rebels. If Barack Obama's tortured grandfather were alive, he might have provided a corrective to the white farmer who told Paxman unchallenged that the British had nothing to be ashamed of. On Newsnight, Paxman wouldn't have allowed an interviewee to get away with such nonsense.",

      "bodyText": "Jenson Button is confident that the new McLaren, upgraded in Barcelona on Saturday, can challenge Red Bull for the Formula One world championship, which starts in Melbourne on Sunday week. Button, who worked on the team's simulator at Woking on Monday before flying to Germany \u2013 homeland of the double world champion Sebastian Vettel \u2013 for sponsorship work on Tuesday, said: \"I'm very happy with the direction we've taken with the car and with the package we have. \"We don't need more bits. We've got it all on the car already. I'm a lot happier with everything compared with last year. We're not running round scratching our heads wondering what we'd done wrong. \"Last year we had problems with the exhaust. We also had the problem that we just weren't very fast, even when the exhaust did work. Maybe that was kept secret. But we just weren't very fast.\" Last year McLaren hit the ground walking. A lack of mileage in testing meant that their uncompetitive car spent all season playing catch-up with Red Bull. By the end of the season they had almost got there, but by then it was too late. Button, hit by hydraulics problems and then rain, was frustrated by a lack of mileage again on Saturday, the penultimate day of the third and final testing session and his last run in the car before Melbourne. But he said: \"We've had a good winter in terms of reliability, most of the time, apart from Saturday. And I feel we are making good progress with the car. There's nothing I'm afraid of with the balance of the car. It listens to changes, which is really important with a motor car.\" The centre of attention in Barcelona at the weekend was a major new upgrade brought in by Red Bull. But Button still looked upbeat when he said: \"It's great that they've brought a big upgrade because it takes everyone's attention off our car. \"They seem to have a very different rear-end system than they had before. But just having different pieces of bodywork doesn't mean it's a massive chunk of laptime. They'll be quick but we don't know how quick.\" But Button, last year's runner-up and one of six world champions on this year's grid, is not writing off Ferrari despite a difficult pre-season for the Italian giants. He said: \"I'm sure Ferrari can find their way out of a sticky situation \u2013 if they're in a sticky situation. I don't really know where they are in terms of pace. \"We're all trying new things at the start of the year. One of us will get it right and I'm sure the others will follow suit in the end. They're obviously on the back foot but I'm sure they'll catch up. They have the resources, they have the expertise and they really want and need a good season in 2012. \"We had such a bad winter last year. Then again we got to the first race and Lewis finished second. So we had a good result. Winter testing is a strange one. We all like a challenge from Ferrari. It's a fantastic team. They've achieved so much.\" Last year, when Ferrari were again out of sorts and team-mate Lewis Hamilton suffered his worst season in F1 \u2013 on and away from the track \u2013 Button looked the best all-round driver and the one most likely to break Vettel's dominance. Britain's last world champion \u2013 he was a winner with Brawn in 2009 \u2013 added: \"Last year was a good year but I didn't need it to make me feel confident in my ability. The first year with a team is always difficult especially when you have spent so many years with another one. \"I was with my previous team for seven years. Initially it was pretty difficult. But I feel that I had a pretty good input into last year's car. It felt like my own and not somebody else's.\" Taking a final look at the coming season he said: \"Sebastian Vettel is the favourite because he is the double world champion. But I feel that the field will be bunched up a lot more now. Red Bull won't have the advantage they had out of the blocks last season.\"",

      "bodyText": "Colin Angus, synthesisers and guitars The Shamen started out as a guitar band, gorging on fungal fruits and tuning into psychedelia. As the personnel changed, we played around Scotland and picked up a few tricks with sequencers, samplers and drum machines. By the spring of 1988 we were living in north London squats, going to clubs like Spectrum, the Trip, Base and outdoor events like Sunrise. This was the heyday of so-called acid house. I remember beaming strangers proffering soft drinks and spliffs dipped in amyl nitrate, snarling pitbulls intimidating saucer-eyed ravers, visionary conversations buzzing in every alcove, hapless promoters being handcuffed and frogmarched off. We'd started using synthesizers and computerised rhythms, and felt we had a synergy of rock, rap and dance. I met Richard [West, DJ Mr C] while sitting cross-legged on the floor of a warehouse. One night, at the Forum, I heard this underworld dandy speaking a pirate-like patois. I found myself thinking, \"Who is he? His first name must begin with an E ... Ebeneezer Goode? Now there's a name to conjure with.\" We had a hoot in the studio. The Mockney-Dickensian flavour came quite naturally from the moniker, and we blended attributes from real-life scenesters we admired. I remember having a right laugh at the thought of this creature lumbering through the gates of pop world, causing amusement and consternation \u2013 and so it came to pass. Mixmag magazine screamed for the single to be banned, although the Beeb seemed quite up for it. Ebeneezer was intended to be celebratory and cautionary, like holding up a distorting mirror to rave culture. The song went ballistic: Uncle Ebeneezer is still looking after me to this day. Richard West, aka Mr C, raps and rhythms I started off as a street rapper; my handle was Mr C, because I supported Chelsea. I first heard about the Shamen in 1988, and in 1991 they asked me to join the band. Colin was a genius songwriter: he'd give me a theme and I'd write the rap lyrics, the drums and the rhythm. He'd do the chords and the synths and the songwriting, and that's how Ebeneezer came along. He told me I was doing the vocals because this character was a cheeky Cockney chappie, and suddenly we had this monster record. I played it to some mates and they were in bits. I thought: \"This is a No 1.\" It was so cleverly written that a lot of people still don't get it. One way, it's about this guy called Ebeneezer Goode; another way, it's about ecstasy: \"E goes by the name of Ebeneezer Goode. E's friends call him Eezer, and E is the main geezer and E vibes up the place like no other man could. E's refined, E's sublime, E makes you feel fine.\" I mean, come on. But even fans think the only E is in the chorus. There was something for everybody. Like Ebenezer Scrooge, it had that old-fashioned Charles Dickens thing that older people could relate to. With the video and the jokiness, kids could like it. If we hadn't become the first band in British pop history to delete a single while it was at No 1 [for four weeks, in September 1992], because it was messing up our release schedule, it may well have sat there for months. When we went on Top of the Pops, I changed the line \"Got any salmon?\" to \"Got any underlay?\" and people said, \"That's not in the song! Drug reference!\" I was asked about it on Radio 1 by [DJ] Mark Goodier, and said that \"salmon\" was rhyming slang for salmon and trout \u2013 snout, cigarettes \u2013 a legal drug that has killed thousands, so I'd changed it. He said: \"So what's 'underlay'?\" I said it was a gratuitous rug reference.",

I found myself thinking, \"Who is he? His first name must begin with an E ... Ebeneezer Goode? Now there's a name to conjure with.\"</p> <p>We had a hoot in the studio. The Mockney-Dickensian flavour came quite naturally from the moniker, and we blended attributes from real-life scenesters we admired.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Russians streamed through metal detectors for hours, past camouflaged trucks and under the whirring blades of a helicopter, to join a mass protest against Vladimir Putin's official return to the Kremlin. They were furious and frustrated. Gone were the lighthearted slogans and costumes that had thus far marked the protests that exploded in Moscow in December and carried through Russia's presidential vote on Sunday. A few held white flowers, a symbol of the peaceful movement. Their white ribbons, until now emblazoned with words like \"For a Putin-less Russia\", hung bare. Many protesters had hoped to force Putin into a second round, proving that Russia's longtime leader had indeed lost the support of the heartland. Instead they were met with an official result of nearly 64% for Putin, buoyed, election monitors say, by massive fraud. Russia's elections chief, Vladimir Churov, called the vote the \"most honest in the world\". \"It's not just about falsifications,\" said Ivan, 65, an office manager, explaining why he turned out on a workday to stand for two hours in wet, windy snow. \"I want our country to be democratic. I want to be led not by crooks and thieves, but by normal people. I want society to democratise, to allow different parties to take part in elections, to allow different people into the presidential election. I want them to stop robbing the country.\" To the 20,000 people who turned out for the protest, Putin wasn't a president, but a tsar. \"These weren't presidential elections \u2013 it was a succession to the throne,\" read one large sign held high above protesters' heads. Opposition leaders, taking to a stage constructed in the shadow of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's most revered poet, refused, one by one, to recognise a president they denounced as \"illegitimate\". \"I've heard that a lot of people are disappointed,\" opposition leader Alexey Navalny shouted from the stage. \"Did you expect something different from these crooks and thieves? They robbed us.\" \"We don't say we have a monopoly, but we are the people \u2013 we have a voice. We are the power here!\" he shouted, launching a refrain repeated dozens of times over by the thousands of angry people in the crowd. He promised that the protests would continue. But he also conceded, in the face of a crowd some five times smaller than those that had gathered before the presidential vote, that change would not come quickly. \"Everyone asks, will we be victorious? When will this happen and what should we do? I have two words that answer all these questions: truth and belief,\" he said. \"We overestimated our numbers a bit. We thought that the rest of the country knows everything that we do.\" That was a recognition of the split result \u2013 if Putin won 64% of votes around the country, he failed to break the 50% barrier in the capital. \"They fucked us again,\" read one massive placard, a succinct summation of what protesters said they felt. Alissa, 21, flew to Moscow early on Monday with her boyfriend in order to attend the protest. They bought their tickets for the two-hour flight from the Urals city of Orenburg after Putin's militant victory speech, which he made before less than 30% of votes were counted on Sunday evening. \"I do not agree with yesterday's election,\" Alissa said. \"We need a new government. We need changes.\" Olga, 17, was just five years old when Putin first came to power, anointed by former president Boris Yeltsin in 1999. She stood beside her father and pushed her fashionably-cut blonde fringe out of her eyes, as she said: \"There are injustices in our government and in our country. If the people who are against that unite, maybe we can change something.\" If Putin serves his full six-year term, she will be a college graduate by then. If he serves a second term, as allowed by the constitution, she will be nearly 30. Her father, Fyodor, said: \"I don't understand how the people of our country, with peace in their souls, can elect a person who didn't just renounce his KGB past, but on the contrary, promotes the system's continuation.\" Peering over the overwhelmingly young crowd, he said he didn't know what would come next. \"No one came here to fight with anyone, or to die for anyone,\" he said. \"Of course it's scary. But if the worst happens, it won't be because of us, but because of what the government does.\" The Kremlin has so far taken the approach of allowing protesters to gather, provided they obtained the appropriate permission from city authorities. Their bet, analysts believe, is that the protest movement will run out of steam. The protesters indicated that would not be the case. As the thousands of peaceful attendees began to flood out of the square, into adjacent streets and metro entrances guarded by thousands of riot police, around 1,000 protesters refused to go. Among them were Navalny and the leftist opposition leader Sergei Udaltsov, who moved towards a fountain in the middle of the square, surrounded by supporters locked arm in arm. Riot police, wearing camouflage and black helmets, moved in to encircle them, launching an hour-long standoff before they finally rushed in, roughly dragging the protesters away to waiting vans. Police said some 250 had been carted off in total. Hundreds more were briefly detained and immediately let go. Navalny was released around four hours later. The riot police rush blew the lid off the anger inside the square. Protesters shouting \"Russia without Putin!\" flooded on to Tverskaya Street, the Moscow thoroughfare that leads straight to the Kremlin. They were chased by columns of riot police, blocking traffic in a chaotic scene. Two hours later, riot police locked arm in arm continued to sweep down Tverskaya, chasing the remaining activists away. One woman in her 40s, wearing a white ribbon, burst into tears. \"Who are you protecting? This isn't Chechnya, it's Moscow\" Earlier, 50 people were detained during an unsanctioned rally of around 3,000 people in St Petersburg and 50 more at a separate, unsanctioned protest in Moscow. Some opposition leaders had threatened an escalation in protest methods, but did not put the move to the larger crowd that had gathered earlier. Many protesters said they were ready to march on the Kremlin if opposition leaders called for it. \"We are ready to be surrounded, thrown into an arrest van and beaten,\" Arnold, 20, who attended the protest with two teenage friends, told the Guardian. He was adorned with badges reading \"Putin go fuck yourself\" written backwards. Some observers believe a change in tactics by the opposition was inevitable given that the presidential election is over and activists may have difficulty sustaining regular peaceful demonstrations. Speaking on stage ahead of his arrest, Navalny denied that the demonstrators would grow weary. \"We will not get tired of coming out into the streets. We will not go away,\" he said. Ahead of the election and the planned protest, the government had poured thousands of extra police and interior ministry troops into the capital, backed by army trucks and at least one helicopter. Putin's decision to return to the presidency has led to an unprecedented movement against his rule. His militant victory speech, in which he described his election win as an \"open and honest battle\", only fuelled protester anger. Several demonstrators carried signs citing a Soviet-era film, \"Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears\", mocking his show of emotion at the Sunday night victory rally. \"We need to do this \u2013 of course something will change,\" said Alexey, 38. \"Pinochet also didn't listen to his people. But when enough got together and forced him into a referendum, he left.\" It was clear that other protesters sought to take a different turn. Upon his release around 1am local time, Navalny said the attempt to occupy the square was an \"experiment\" launched by Udaltsov. The events of Monday night, he said, \"showed that there are already hundreds of people ready to remain until the end.\"",

His militant victory speech, in which he described his election win as an \"open and honest battle\", only fuelled protester anger. Several demonstrators carried signs citing a Soviet-era film, \"Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears\", mocking his show of emotion at the Sunday night victory rally.</p> <p>\"We need to do this \u2013 of course something will change,\" said Alexey, 38. \"Pinochet also didn't listen to his people. But when enough got together and forced him into a referendum, he left.\"</p> <p>It was clear that other protesters sought to take a different turn. Upon his release around 1am local time, Navalny said the attempt to occupy the square was an \"experiment\" launched by Udaltsov. The events of Monday night, he said, \"showed that there are already hundreds of people ready to remain until the end.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have a big family. I have four children, from ages 8 to 19: three sons and my youngest is my daughter. I never meant to be a single mother, but sometimes, that is just how life works out. In any case, my children still have two parents who love them. There is never a minute that goes by when they are not in my thoughts. I am so proud of them and know that of anything I do: of any piece of writing or artwork I leave here on this earth, my greatest accomplishment are my children. I can see each of their smiles as I type this. I, too, come from a large family. So when people say, \"Oh wow, four kids!\" \u2013 like it's a bad thing \u2013 I have to giggle. My brother has seven children. My mom has seven of us; I am the eldest. Or I am, as my siblings say, \"Forty and still a shorty.\" Of my mom's seven, my brother Travis and I have a different father than the younger five. Bear with me; this may get confusing. So, my brother Travis and I also have three other siblings with our father. We have two sisters, who both have four or more children. I have a ton of nieces and nephews, and yes, I am the \"cool aunt\". And we also have a brother. His name is, or was, Wakiya. Wakiya means Thunder in our language. The reason I say this \"was\" his name is because his name may have been changed. We don't know this because none of us has ever met Wakiya. He was taken from his mother in 1991 by the state of South Dakota. I'm not writing this to say what should have been done, who should have done what, or point a finger. Everyone here on earth has a different journey, and I feel too many people out there are quick to judge others on the past when not one person here has ever walked the same trail as the other. In the past few years, I have learned to live my life with an open heart and open mind and listen to people with my soul. I have always been curious about Wakiya, never really knowing if he was for certain my brother. I never asked, just heard something about him in passing when I was younger. I think I may have been scared to ask, or find out what happened to him. Finally, one day, I read of the NPR investigation about how so many of the Native American children in South Dakota were being taken from their families, and never given back. So much so, that it was compared to when Native American children were forcibly removed from their homes back in the post-reservation days and sent to boarding schools where the motto was \"Kill the Indian, Save the Man.\" The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 states that, except in the rarest circumstances, Native American children must be placed with their relatives or tribes. It also says states must do everything they can to keep native families together. The six-part investigation also noted that although Native American children only make up 15% of the children in the state of South Dakota, they make up more than 50% of the children in foster care. Many of the Native American children in foster care are lost to their families forever, as they are placed outside their tribe and eventually lose their culture. After reading this, I thought more about Wakiya and wondered where he was. I looked for him on Facebook, but that was a dead end. I am sure his name was changed. I knew nothing of him except his first name. So I did a search on his mother and found her living in the same city as I am. When I first contacted her, I made small talk, trying to build up courage to ask if she was the mother to my brother. Then, she must have known. She told me about Wakiya. How he was taken by the state, when she was battling her demons of addiction. She was now clean, and sober for over two years. She, too, wanted to look for him, but her rights had been terminated, so she had no clue how to even start. Then, she asked if I wanted to see pictures of him. Of course, I did. She said she would text me the pictures in a while. I waited for what seemed like for ever, although it was only minutes \u2013 all the while, texting my brother in another state, as we were about to see what our brother Wakiya looked like for the first time. When the first picture came through, I cried and forwarded it to him. From the second that first one came through I knew and my brother knew: he was our brother. I could see myself, my brother, my sisters, my children, my nieces and nephews in his eyes. I could practically feel the same blood that beats in my heart beating in his. This was my little brother and I had to find him. I started off writing and calling the South Dakota department of social services, studying what I could of the Indian Child Welfare Act, since I knew basically nothing about it. What I did learn was that when Wakiya was taken, he was eight years old. I was 19 at the time: I had a job, my own apartment, and I didn't have children. I was never contacted by the department of social services or Indian child welfare. Had I known about Wakiya's situation, and had they approached me, there would have been no hesitation: I would have taken him in a heart beat. I have made contact with the proper authorities; I was apologized to \u2013 though that hardly matters now. I was told the Indian Child Welfare Act and department of social services can no longer do anything for me other than \"try\" to forward a letter to him, because he was adopted, but the adoption was a closed adoption. So, in this short life and what time we have left, as I am almost 40 years old and Wakiya is going to be 29, my future with my brother lies in the hope of an envelope and a 45-cent stamp. The place I have in my heart for my great extended family has room for more. I pray this works.",

      "bodyText": "A small but significant anniversary in modern Conservative politics is celebrated on Wednesday evening: Policy Exchange, the most influential thinktank in Britain and the policy seedbed of compassionate Conservatism, marks its 10th anniversary. No champagne will be consumed. Instead, Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister and one of the thinktank's founders, will make a speech recalling how, back in 2002, Policy Exchange, under the aegis of its first director, Nick Boles, was conceived to fill an intellectual void on the centre right. Probably more than any other organisation, the well-resourced brains trust has shaped Tory thinking \u2013 on elected police commissioners, Michael Gove's school reforms and the pupil premium. A small, influential pamphlet entitled Compassionate Conservatism, written by Jesse Norman and Janan Ganesh, tried to give the movement a philosophical base through the idea of a connected society. \"Everyone in politics discussed the state and the market, but had neglected what lies in between \u2013 civil society and community,\" Ganesh recently said. \"We thought the new battleground of politics would take place on that turf.\" The 10th anniversary comes at a pivotal time for Tory party modernisers. With the departure from Downing Street of policy strategist Steve Hilton, the future shape of Conservatism seems to be in flux. The impression is that Hilton raged against the machine, and the machine, in the form of the civil service and the EU, won. That said, the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, was at pains to deny on Monday that the civil service had been at loggerheads with Hilton, and said he was looking at letting more outsiders make policy so policy development in Whitehall could be outsourced. Even before Hilton's departure, the age of austerity was gnawing away at the platforms \u2013 big and small \u2013 on which Cameroonism Mark 1 was constructed. The \"big society\", green politics, sharing the proceeds of growth, a quiet public service reform, data transparency and localism are now all under challenge. Even legal gay marriage, once the symbol of a different Conservatism, is being questioned. Among Conservative MPs, it is the rightwing Free Enterprise group that appears to be making the running in advance of the budget. It is a sign of the challenge to welfare caused by austerity that senior ministers were on Monday openly at odds over how much wealthy taxpayers should suffer by losing the right to child benefit. Cameron himself felt the need in his weekend speech to rebut the charge that austerity had trumped compassion. \"It is only by taking tough and bold action that we will make our country stronger and fairer,\" he said. \"True compassion isn't wearing your heart on your sleeve \u2026 it's rolling up those sleeves and taking the long-term decisions that will really change our country for the better.\" And Maude, in his speech, will argue that it is possible to combine growth and compassion, and again contend that the party can only win if it has an appeal to non-traditional Tory voters. Policy Exchange, as much as any thinktank, has a responsibility for creating that appeal. Judging by a talk given last week by its director, Neil O'Brien, suggestions that the Tory stream of ideas is drying up are premature. The intellectual self-confidence is as strong as ever. One of O'Brien's themes is that most voters see values such as fairness though the prism of welfare. He argues: \"People's ideas about fairness are much more about 'something for something' than about equality. There is very strong support for the idea that if you have been on unemployment benefits for a reasonably long period, you should be asked to do something in return for those benefits, like workfare. Eighty per cent of people, for instance, support the idea that if you are out of work for more than a year, you should be asked to do community work in return for your benefit.\" He suggests claimants should be required to spend more time each day looking for work, and praised the Australian system where the only role of government is to make the initial assessment of a claimant, and then immediately hand that claimant over to specialist providers, rather than, as at present, after nine months or so. He adds: \"At present, jobcentre advisers are loathe to sanction people for not complying with the rules, for not going to job interviews, for not trying hard enough because they don't want to discourage people. Could we do something smart like they do in Australia where the sanction is not financial so if you don't play by the rules, you get given a card that has your benefits on it and that prevents you spending money on tobacco, gambling or drink ?\" More broadly, he argues, the right needed to think about how to restore the contributory principle \u2013 a form of unemployment insurance \u2013 which he said had been lost in the UK \"almost in an absence of mind\". O'Brien also seems to recognise that growth and planning needs to be rethought. The Conservatives' planning reforms, especially \"the new homes bonus\" which gives councils the right to keep cash from new developments, already need revisiting since they are not themselves going to break the deadlock between the planners and the Nimbys. O'Brien proposes giving \"actual cash direct to those who are most affected by developments near them, rather than giving some kind of incentive to the local council. It is not much consolation to you if you have a housing estate built right next to you to know that the local council will have the money to build a development at the other end of the town.\" He also suggests new garden cities, a sell-off of the most expensive social housing stock to build housing in cheaper areas, and allowing empty buildings in town centres to be converted to residential use without requiring local government consent. And he condemns perverse incentives in housing, arguing: \"Since the 1977 Housing Act, the way to get social housing \u2013 which is often worth more than cash benefits, particularly if you live in inner London \u2013 is to be very dependent om state benefits.\" Policy Exchange is also going to champion one of the most controversial issues in contemporary politics: the breakup of national pay bargaining in the public sector. O'Brien argues: \"There is a huge public-sector pay premium in the less prosperous parts of the country \u2013 Yorkshire, the north-west, the north-east and Northern Ireland. People can see that it is unfair. You are effectively overpaying some people in some areas more than they need because the cost of living is so low, and you are underpaying people in expensive areas, leading to shortages and possibly poorer quality of teaching.\" Suspicious that the Treasury will stall on this reform programme, Policy Exchange is looking at how to follow the example of Sweden, which moved from a centrally-set pay bargaining system to one in which public sector employees all have their own individual contracts. Public sector reform does not stop there. Social enterprise, or profit-making schools, could speed the reduction in inadequate schools. Police inefficiency should be targeted. \"In a lot of forces a third of the police do not make a single arrest in a year. The incentives in the police are set up in completely the wrong way. We have to break out of the paradigm that it is all about resources \u2013 it is not about how many police officers you have, it is how you use them and how efficient the police force is. Deployment trumps employment,\" O'Brien says. The ideas, many foreign-based, keep flowing. O'Brien asks whether, just as police commissioners are elected, someone could be elected and made responsible for the entire criminal justice system, \"so they could move money away from prison and put it into prevention\". Sure Start is also in O'Brien's firing line. \"I find the evidence from the Sure Start programme incredibly depressing because the evidence, so far as there is a proper evaluation, is that it is not doing much to raise children's cognitive ability, so if we want to have real equality of opportunity we need to do something that is more effective.\" He suggests the government might need to move from its existing child poverty measures to \"a causes of poverty target\" \u2013 tracking teen pregnancy and kids dropping out of schools or getting into trouble with the criminal justice system at an early stage. Even the green agenda needs readdressing because, O'Brien says, the departed energy secretary Chris Huhne had been running a dirigiste, expensive agenda. Cleaner, cheaper energy is possible, O'Brien claims, since hundreds of millions could be saved if the government backed a market-based approach, rather than \"backing particular expensive technologies\" \u2013 by which he means wind power. Guardian readers may not warm to all or most of this agenda, but few can say that, post-Hilton, the Conservatives are as yet intellectually exhausted.",

The Conservatives' planning reforms, especially \"the new homes bonus\" which gives councils the right to keep cash from new developments, already need revisiting since they are not themselves going to break the deadlock between the planners and the&#xa0;Nimbys.</p> <p>O'Brien proposes giving \"actual cash direct to those who are most affected by developments near them, rather than giving some kind of incentive to the local council. It is not much consolation to you if you have a housing estate built right next to you to know that the local council will have the money to build a development at the other end of the town.\"</p> <p>He also suggests new garden cities, a sell-off of the most expensive social housing stock to build housing in cheaper areas, and allowing empty buildings in town centres to be converted to residential use without requiring local government consent. And he condemns perverse incentives in housing, arguing: \"Since the 1977 Housing Act, the way to get social housing \u2013 which is often worth more than cash benefits, particularly if you live in inner London \u2013 is to be very dependent om state benefits.\"</p> <p>Policy Exchange is also going to champion one of the most controversial issues in contemporary politics: the breakup of national pay bargaining in the public sector. O'Brien argues: \"There is a huge public-sector pay premium in the less prosperous parts of the country \u2013 Yorkshire, the north-west, the north-east and Northern Ireland. People can see that it is unfair. You are effectively overpaying some people in some areas more than they need because the cost of living is so low, and you are underpaying people in expensive areas, leading to shortages and possibly poorer quality of&#xa0;teaching.\"</p> <p>Suspicious that the Treasury will stall on this reform programme, Policy Exchange is looking at how to follow the example of Sweden, which moved from a centrally-set pay bargaining system to one in which public sector employees all have their own individual contracts.</p> <p>Public sector reform does not stop there. Social enterprise, or profit-making schools, could speed the reduction in inadequate schools. Police inefficiency should be targeted. \"In a lot of forces a third of the police do not make a single arrest in a year. The incentives in the police are set up in completely the wrong way. We have to break out of the paradigm that it is all about resources \u2013 it is not about how many police officers you have, it is how you use them and how efficient the police force is. Deployment trumps employment,\" O'Brien says.</p> <p>The ideas, many foreign-based, keep flowing. O'Brien asks whether, just as police commissioners are elected, someone could be elected and made responsible for the entire criminal justice system, \"so they could move money away from prison and put it into prevention\".</p> <p>Sure Start is also in O'Brien's firing line. \"I find the evidence from the Sure Start programme incredibly depressing because the evidence, so far as there is a proper evaluation, is that it is not doing much to raise children's cognitive ability, so if we want to have real equality of opportunity we need to do something that is more effective.\"</p> <p>He suggests the government might need to move from its existing child poverty measures to \"a causes of poverty target\" \u2013 tracking teen pregnancy and kids dropping out of schools or getting into trouble with the criminal justice system at an early stage.</p> <p>Even the green agenda needs readdressing because, O'Brien says, the departed energy secretary Chris Huhne had been running a dirigiste, expensive agenda. Cleaner, cheaper energy is possible, O'Brien claims, since hundreds of millions could be saved if the government backed a market-based approach, rather than \"backing particular expensive technologies\" \u2013 by which he means wind power.</p> <p>Guardian readers may not warm to all or most of this agenda, but few can say that, post-Hilton, the Conservatives are as yet intellectually exhausted.</p>",

Until recently, by far the most persuasive way for Vladimir Putin to project that image was to steal elections without triggering massive public protests afterwards. Going by today's events, it looks like things have changed. I write this having just left a massive opposition protest taking place at Pushkin Square: ringed by police and metal barriers, the anti-corruption activist Alexey Navalny is whipping up a crowd with the chant \"Putin: thief! Putin: thief!\" The last time Moscow saw protests like these, they were aimed at the Duma \u2013 this time, the anger is viscerally directed at the leader himself. Managed democracy enhanced Putin's strongman image not because it simulated democracy, but because \u2013 by delivering sky-high official results in favour of Putin, his surrogate Dmitry Medvedev and his party United Russia \u2013 it simulated management. Without elections reliably rigged at all levels, Putin would have had a much harder time convincing the public that he exercised any serious control over Russia's anarchically self-serving officialdom. Putin's previous legitimacy formula was first tested in early December last year, when a falsified parliamentary vote triggered a wave of public protests. True, he had no trouble rigging the presidential election, if only by making sure that no plausible competitor could arise or get on the ballot; but he can no longer count on the inhabitants of Moscow reacting with fatalistic resignation. So how, given the inevitability of protest, is he going to manage the electoral aftermath so that Sunday's disputed vote displays his power and not his weakness? Russia is a country where a nascent political society is suffocated by a total lack of functioning political institutions. That the rubber-stamp Duma is not a serious legislature is obvious. More profoundly, the presidency itself was revealed to be an empty facade when Putin handed it over for a term, minus its powers, to Medvedev. And Putin's attempt to turn United Russia into a governing party foundered so badly in the December elections that he ran his presidential campaign without even mentioning the party of which he is the ostensible founder and leader. Not even the FSB (the successor to the KGB) seems to have enough institutional strength to control its own officers. Understanding the institutional wasteland is essential if we are to make sense of the violent reaction caused by Putin's announcement, on 24 September, that he was looking to return to the Kremlin for a third term. What this announcement conveyed was that Russia has no system of rules by which one president can be succeeded by another: the transfer of power remains a matter of personal choice by the ruling elite. The absence of any plausible succession formula is the central flaw in Putin's current pseudo-state. From the viewpoint of Russia's voters, it confirms the feeling that Russia is a country without a future, or at least is a country in which the future has no reliable institutional basis, but is constructed wholly upon the unpredictable survival and physical health of a single mortal man. When Putin said \"Glory to Russia!\" to the crowd gathered on Sunday night at Manezh Square, he meant glory to a Russia that can see no way to go forward without Putin himself. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "Nearly a year has passed since Israel's former intelligence chief Meir Dagan said that a strike on Iran's nuclear installations would be a stupid idea, unlikely to achieve its objectives, but certain to set off a regional war. In that time, virtually all of Israel's opinion formers have coalesced around the view that a war with Iran is inevitable. This was stoked not only by Iranian-sponsored actions such as the bombings against Israeli diplomatic targets in Bangkok, New Delhi and Tbilisi, but regular statements by the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, and prime minster, Binyamin Netanyahu. The very suspicion of an Iranian bomb programme is framed by the latter as a threat to the state's existence, as if Israel does not possess up to 400 nuclear bombs of its own. There is nothing to say that, as nuclear powers, Iran and Israel would not be bound by the same rules of mutually assured destruction as India and Pakistan are. The purpose of Israel's narrative was to move the timeframe for such an attack forward. Mr Dagan said he did not think Iran would be able to build a nuclear weapon before 2015. Washington further distinguishes between an Iranian ability to assemble a bomb and the decision by the ayatollah to actually do so. In response to both, Israeli leaders warned that Iran's uranium enrichment programme was about to enter its \"zone of immunity\" \u2013 the idea that there is only a limited amount of time to attack Iran's nuclear installations that are all buried in mountain tunnels. It was important for Barack Obama to stand firm both publicly and in private with Mr Netanyahu. This he did when he admonished Israel and its US supporters for too much loose talk of war and reminded them that the world had a responsibility to give sanctions a chance to work. With Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum all scheduled to address the same audience this week, it was important for Mr Obama to turn down the volume knob on Iran. A political timetable is at work here as well. If and when he is re-elected, Mr Obama will feel less bound by the need to listen to a hawkish congress. Mr Obama said much to soothe Israeli ears \u2013 that its fear of a nuclear-armed Iran was legitimate and that America had a commitment to maintain Israel's military edge. What he did not retreat from were the repeated statements by senior administration officials doubting Israel's military capability against Iran. For the US military to be as aggressive as that about the military capability of its closest ally testifies to a dialogue that is tougher in private than it is in public. The National Iranian American Council ran an ad signed by an array of military brass urging the president to say no to a war of choice with Iran. The US military feels it has not been through two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, only to be bounced into a third. Nor did Mr Obama move the goalposts. The aim of US policy, he made clear, was to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, not the capacity to build one. His strategy is clear \u2013 to get through this year without any further deterioration of the situation with Iran. He will have to go much further. As the history of every other successful piece of multi-lateral negotiation has shown \u2013 seven years elapsed between Libya ratifying the NPT and the security council vote lifting sanctions \u2013 Mr Obama will have to invest significant resources and time to defuse this crisis peacefully. For sanctions to work as an incentive, they have to be liftable. EU sanctions are enforced by an executive, the EU commission, but US sanctions are locked into place by a legislature, the US Congress. Left to the laws of gravity, naval flotillas around the strait of Hormuz, and the opportunity for unscripted events, US relations with Iran will deteriorate further unless energy is put into creating incentives for Iran to change course on enriching uranium. It is more important than ever to remember that while the IAEA have serious concerns about a possible bomb programme, there is no proof. To launch a full-scale war in the Middle East on the basis of a hunch, would be folly itself.",

This was stoked not only by Iranian-sponsored actions such as the bombings against Israeli diplomatic targets in Bangkok, New Delhi and Tbilisi, but regular statements by the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, and prime minster, Binyamin Netanyahu.</p> <p>The very suspicion of an Iranian bomb programme is framed by the latter as a threat to the state's existence, as if Israel does not possess up to 400 nuclear bombs of its own. There is nothing to say that, as nuclear powers, Iran and Israel would not be bound by the same rules of mutually assured destruction as India and Pakistan are. The purpose of Israel's narrative was to move the timeframe for such an attack forward. Mr Dagan said he did not think Iran would be able to build a nuclear weapon before 2015. Washington further distinguishes between an Iranian ability to assemble a bomb and the decision by the ayatollah to actually do so. In response to both, Israeli leaders warned that Iran's uranium enrichment programme was about to enter its \"zone of immunity\" \u2013 the idea that there is only a limited amount of time to attack Iran's nuclear installations that are all buried in mountain tunnels. It was important for Barack Obama to stand firm both publicly and in private with Mr Netanyahu.</p> <p>This he did when he admonished Israel and&#xa0;its US supporters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/04/obama-aipac-speech-read-text?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">for too much loose talk&#xa0;of war</a> and reminded them that the world&#xa0;had a&#xa0;responsibility to give sanctions a chance to&#xa0;work. With Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney&#xa0;and Rick Santorum all scheduled to address the same audience this week, it was&#xa0;important for&#xa0;Mr Obama to turn down the&#xa0;volume knob&#xa0;on Iran. A political timetable&#xa0;is at work here as well. If and when he is re-elected, Mr Obama will feel less bound by&#xa0;the need to listen to a hawkish congress.</p> <p>Mr Obama said much to soothe Israeli ears \u2013 that its fear of a nuclear-armed Iran was legitimate and that America had a commitment to maintain Israel's military edge. What he did not retreat from were the repeated statements by senior administration officials doubting Israel's military capability against Iran. For the US military to be as aggressive as that about the military capability of its closest ally testifies to a dialogue that is tougher in private than it is in public. The National Iranian American Council ran <a href=\"http://www.niacouncil.org/images/content/pagebuilder/NIAC-Washington-Post-Ad-ful.jpg\" title=\"\">an ad signed by an array of military brass </a>urging the president to say no to a war of choice with Iran. The US military feels it has not been through two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, only to be bounced into a third. Nor did Mr Obama move the goalposts. The aim of US policy, he made clear, was to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, not the capacity to build one. His strategy is clear \u2013 to get through this year without any further deterioration of the situation with Iran.</p> <p>He will have to go much further. As the history of every other successful piece of multi-lateral negotiation has shown \u2013<a href=\"http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/LibyaChronology\" title=\"\"> seven years</a> elapsed between Libya ratifying the NPT and the security council vote lifting sanctions \u2013 Mr Obama will have to invest significant resources and time to defuse this crisis peacefully. For sanctions to work as an incentive, they have to be liftable. EU sanctions are enforced by an executive, the EU commission, but US sanctions are locked into place by a legislature, the US Congress.</p> <p>Left to the laws of gravity, naval flotillas around the strait of Hormuz, and the opportunity for unscripted events, US relations with Iran will deteriorate further unless energy is put into creating incentives for Iran to change course on enriching uranium. It is more important than ever to remember that while the IAEA have serious concerns about a possible bomb programme, there is no proof. To launch a full-scale war in the Middle East on the basis of a hunch, would be folly itself.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first thing we do, let's kill all lawyers\", says a Jack Cade rebel in Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 2. It always gets a laugh and a whoop or two. Kenneth Clarke, secretary of state for justice, knows his audience too: few hearts bleed at cutting lawyers' fees. Naturally he blurs the difference between fat cat barristers earning fortunes from legal aid in high-profile criminal cases, whose fees he leaves untouched \u2013 and the work of social conscience lawyers, whose fees he is abolishing completely. Public interest lawyers earn very little in law centres and Citizens Advice bureaus, helping people lost in the legal wilderness of welfare, tenancies or working rights. As a result, law centres and CABs will close. Yesterday a visitor to Westminster could observe the double whammy. Down one end of the corridor the Commons debated some of the harshest parts of the welfare reform bill. A Labour debate highlighted the under-publicised savagery of tax credit cuts that next month take between \u00a33,000 and \u00a34,000 away from low-earning families who can't get their working time up to 24 hours a week. Hundreds of thousands of people and 470,000 children still have no idea of the devastating income cut about to hit them on 6 April. Meanwhile, down the other end of the corridor, the Lords debated the legal aid bill which removes all legal support that ensures people at least get the benefits they are entitled to. Legal aid is abolished for \"social\" cases, even if people risk losing their homes and livelihoods, even if the Department for Work and Pensions blunders kick away crutches or leave cancer patients in the lurch. Maladministration sees 40% of appeals against disability benefit removal overturned, but there will be no legal help for any claimants' redress. Employers need worry less about regulations, now that their employees can get no legal aid to challenge unfair dismissal or harassment. Though evictions by private landlords have risen by 17%, the bill abolishes legal aid for tenants. Public attention may not fix on legal aid, but when asked in a poll for the Legal Action Group, 80% said those with low incomes should get free legal support. The government admits 600,000 people now using legal advice every year will lose access to it. In the Lords yesterday the most magisterial of silks and wigs attacked the \u00a3350m cut that stops the humblest using the law: Clarke will find the august Lord Woolf, Lady Butler-Sloss, Lord Pannick, Lady Scotland and many other big legal brains fiercely robust opponents. Fewer victims of domestic violence will bring their abusers to court when a far tougher measure of \"objective evidence\" means half the cases will never be heard. Half the victims at present on legal aid will no longer qualify, when medical evidence from A&amp;E, GPs or a women's refuge will not be enough. There will be no legal aid even in child custody battles between couples. A father may have the funds to hire a good lawyer, but the mother will be left to represent herself in court over children and money. This comes at the same time that mothers will have to pay to use the child support agency, and be charged at least 12% on any money collected. The government says couples must \"sort things out for themselves\" or seek mediation. But with no threat of court, why should fathers pay? Maintenance becomes voluntary. Sometimes I find I have to pinch myself to believe these things are really happening. But what stirs a sense of injustice among restless Tory backbenchers is none of these \u2013 which they heartily support. They are exercised over cutting child benefit for higher earning families. Here is an unfairness they understand because it's happening to their people. George Osborne is scurrying to patch up an error that sees two earners on \u00a340,000 keep child benefit while a couple with one earner on \u00a344,000 and a stay-at-home mother loses the lot. Anyone whose pay rises \u00a31 above the \u00a343,875 higher tax rate also loses all \u00a31,700 a year for two children. The word is that the chancellor could ease the pain by not cutting child benefit until families earn \u00a350,000. That doesn't change the essential unfairness. Is this politically dangerous? Beyond angry backbenchers, probably not. Where else will those better-off voters go? Rarely towards Labour. Families on \u00a343,000 may not feel well off, but they aren't the squeezed middle, either: they are in the top 8.2% of earners, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The median income for a couple with two children is \u00a330,066. That shows how the Tory sense of injustice doesn't start to twitch until it reaches the upper echelons, even more so over their hatred of the 50p tax band. Listen to them protest how unfair a mansion tax would be on homes worth more than \u00a32m: older people with ordinary incomes living in extraordinarily valuable properties should not be made to pay up, move out or downsize. Yet in the same breath they pass the welfare reform bill that forces out poor social tenants from their family homes if they have just one spare bedroom. A curious and apparently quite fierce argument broke out in the cabinet's home affairs committee over the chancellor's plan to triple the minimum price of cheap booze to about 50p a unit: cheapest cider would rise to \u00a34 per 2-litre bottle to deter the bingeing that costs the NHS dear. Suddenly all those ministers who raised not a murmur against the tax credit cuts that shrink incomes of \u00a317,000 to \u00a313,000 overnight became deeply concerned at the injustice of \"penalising the poor\". Michael Gove, Andrew Lansley and Nick Clegg saw this as a nanny-state assault on individual liberty. Maybe they feel the drinks industry pressure; maybe they are wary of a drink tax due to come in just before the 2015 election? But how perverse to be more concerned with libertarian dogma than with crippling cuts to family incomes or abolition of poor people's right to the law if unjustly sacked, evicted or denied a benefit. The welfare reform bill has passed and the NHS bill will too, now Shirley Williams has folded. But the silks on the red benches may yet give the legal aid bill the bloodiest nose of the three. This is a crude and cruel way to save legal costs, since most legal aid goes on large fees to lawyers in a few cases, while least is spent defending the rights of the desperate. Radical reform would upend the extravagance of court practices and rewards. But Kenneth Clarke QC, as with other ministers and their bills, finds it more congenial to swing the axe not against the rich and powerful, but against those who will make least noise. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

As we wrote last week, the game will be set during the American Revolution, over 200 years after the events of Assassin's Creed Revelations. This time, the lead character is Ratohnak\u00e9:ton, a half-British, half-Mohawk warrior whose village is burned down amid the battle for independence and he must now fight for vengeance. From the press release: Players become an Assassin in the war for liberty against ruthless tyranny in the most stylised and fluid combat experiences in the franchise to date. Assassin's Creed III spans the Revolutionary War, taking gamers from the vibrant, untamed frontier to bustling colonial towns and the intense, chaotic battlefields where George Washington's Continental Army clashed with the imposing British Army. The game is apparently showcasing a new in-house engine technology, named Ubisoft-AnvilNext. It will allegedly provide unprecedented graphical detail as well as advanced artifical inteligence. In an interesting piece of cross-platform marketing, fresh artwork from Assassin's Creed III will be featured in Assassin's Creed Recollection, a board game app for the iPad. \"Assassin's Creed III features the franchise's most expansive setting so far, along with an exciting new hero and exponentially more gameplay,\" said Ubisoft CEO, Yves Guillemot. \"Whether you're a longtime fan of Assassin's Creed or if you're new to the franchise, you're going to be blown away by the scale and marvel of Assassin's Creed III.\" It's certainly an interesting set-up, and the lead character's position between the Brits, the native Americans and the 13 American colonies, puts him in a good position to catch all the key events of the era. As some fans have mentioned, though, high buildings will be in short supply in 18th Century America, surely limiting the series' usual acrobatic parkour gameplay. However, the country wasn't entirely flat. John Joseph Holland's water colour of New York shows plenty of height; and Paul Revere's famous engraving of the Boston Massacre reveals that city's highly developed architecture \u2013 just behind the massacre bit at the front. Also, the American revolution is a swirl of Assassin's-style conspiracies involving everyone from the Illuminati to the Freemasons. If you want a headstart, it might be worth researching a few of those before the game arrives this autumn. You can see the teaser trailer here.",

But make no mistake about it, huge swaths of the city's older neighbourhoods must be demolished and reconstructed during the next 10-20 years if a humanitarian catastrophe is to be averted. In the aftermath of the 1999 Marmara earthquake, the Japanese International Co-operation Agency predicted that the likely toll of the next major earthquake would be some 90,000 deaths, 135,000 serious injuries and the destruction or serious damage of 170,000 buildings. This impact will be heavily concentrated in 12 of the city's 32 municipalities, including the historic districts. JICA argued that effective mitigation will require more than a million dwellings to be demolished or structurally upgraded in 400 neighbourhoods, which are home to more than 5 million people. Thus far, neighbourhood regeneration has been dominated by the state-sponsored gentrification of centrally located, historic districts such as Sulukule and Tarlabasi. This coercive \"top-down\" process sparked widespread resistance to regeneration across the city, epitomised by the slogan '\"no Sulukule here\". But the vast majority of earthquake-vulnerable neighbourhoods, outside the historic core, consist of poor quality, concrete-frame construction, apartment blocks. Demand and land values are much lower, so improved compensation and cheap mortgages may well enable most resident owners to stay in their redeveloped neighbourhood. However, as things stand, scores of thousands of poor tenants would be displaced. This prospect fuels continuing resistance. The Turkish government must now create a social rented housing sector. This would support neighbourhood redevelopment by providing re-housing for tenants as locally as possible. In parallel, the government should also sponsor capacity development for local municipalities and community organisations, in order to create a \"bottom-up\" process of community-led neighbourhood regeneration. It is buildings, not earthquakes, that kill people.

      "bodyText": "It's four weeks early for April Fools' Day (Revealed: hidden government plans to privatise the police, 3 March). Not only is the list of functions to be privatised \"breathtaking\", the very principle is preposterous. The bottom line for profit-making enterprises is \u2013 the bottom line. The relationship between the Met police and private news corporations should alert us to how the interests of private profit can distort those of the public good when the relationship gets too close, perhaps above all in the area of policing. Tellingly, West Midlands police has said that the proposal \"is aimed at totally transforming the way the force currently does business\". The point is that the police are not there to \"do business\". The record of private firms such as G4S in private prisons, immigration detention centres and deportations is, frankly, not so shining as to inspire confidence. What next? Privatising military functions? MI6? We only need look to the US, from where the model comes (and from where it was profitably exported to Afghanistan and Iran), to see its future here. Scott Poynting Manchester \u2022\u2008To add to your disclosure that G4S and other private security companies are bidding for contracts worth \u00a31.5bn for police privatisation, could I point out that G4S and other security companies (Serco and Reliance) are this week finalising national contracts worth \u00a3135m for asylum-seeker housing. In South Yorkshire, where G4S is the preferred bidder, this will mean that 500 asylum seekers and their families will be dispersed from council property into poor-quality private rented housing. Over the past month local councillors, asylum rights groups, Unison, academics, churches and faith groups have campaigned to get the contract stopped. G4S is not only finalising a contract which will privatise humanitarian housing provided by councils for the past 50 years. More importantly, perhaps, G4S is also a company which has managed detention centres, and provided escorts for deportees \u2013 in fact three of its escort staff are at present on bail facing criminal charges relating to the death of Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan man. John Grayson South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group \u2022\u2008 Far from eroding the public policing function, private companies could bolster it. Private involvement in policing is already widespread, and greater use of civilians has improved services and reduced waste. In many areas, civilians have freed up resources otherwise spent on expensive officers to do jobs in business support and control rooms that do not require warranted powers. Our research supports the view of Ian Blair (Comment, 5 March) that there is scope to go much further. There are at least 7,000 officers currently in roles that could be filled by civilians, thereby costing an extra \u00a3150m every year. But cost savings are a by-product of outsourcing, not the objective. The real aim is to free up officers \u2013 the most valuable asset a force has \u2013 to fight crime. We can all work to prevent crime, but only warranted officers can arrest offenders and that special power should never be given away. But any reform that puts more officers in a position to fight crime should be seen as an opportunity, not a threat. Blair Gibbs Crime and justice unit, Policy Exchange \u2022 How is privatisation of parts of our public services presented as a means of making cuts and saving money (Police chiefs say privatisation 'only way' to tackle cuts, 5 March)? I can see how there might be cuts: in numbers of jobs; in status and wages of the staff in the newly created private companies; and probably in their employment and pension rights. But let's ask how these private companies make their profits. And why should they, when it is our taxes that are providing their business income? I imagine there will be no cuts to the aspired salaries and bonuses of the company directors. Less desirable cuts will be to the Inland Revenue and National Insurance coffers, once the privatised sections of the police have set up their businesses with offshore money, huge tax-avoidance schemes arranged for the directors and managers, and an employment pool of low-paid staff or consultants on short contracts paying far less tax than our current police's PAYE. And when it all goes belly-up, there will be a hugely expensive inquiry or two, no doubt paid for by us, the public, and the fat cats will walk away scot-free. Dr Susan H Treagus Manchester \u2022 Ian Blair declares his hand as chairman of Bluelight Global Solutions, a company formed by ex-senior police officers. They include Bob Quick, ex-assistant commissioner for the Met police, Paul Hancock, ex-chief constable for Bedfordshire constabulary, and Bill Hughes, ex-director of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. It is no surprise that they advocate private-sector delivery of police functions now that they make their money from the private sector. Paul Richards Eastbourne, East Sussex \u2022 Having spent much of the 90s working as a detective and witnessing first-hand the effect that the then newly created performance targets had, I can easily envisage the future of minor crime investigation.

Not only is the list of functions to be privatised \"breathtaking\", the very principle is preposterous. The bottom line for profit-making enterprises is \u2013 the bottom line. The relationship between the Met police and private news corporations should alert us to how the interests of private profit can distort those of the public good when the relationship gets too close, perhaps above all in the area of policing.</p> <p>Tellingly, West Midlands police has said that the proposal \"is aimed at totally transforming the way the force currently does business\". The point is that the police are not there to \"do business\". The record of private firms such as G4S in private prisons, immigration detention centres and deportations is, frankly, not so shining as to inspire confidence.</p> <p>What next? Privatising military functions? MI6? We only need look to the US, from where the model comes (and from where it was profitably exported to Afghanistan and Iran), to see its future here.<br><strong>Scott Poynting</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008To add to your disclosure that G4S and other private security companies are bidding for contracts worth \u00a31.5bn for police privatisation, could I point out that G4S and other security companies (Serco and Reliance) are this week finalising national contracts worth \u00a3135m for asylum-seeker housing.</p> <p>In South Yorkshire, where G4S is the preferred bidder, this will mean that 500 asylum seekers and their families will be dispersed from council property into poor-quality private rented housing. Over the past month local councillors, asylum rights groups, Unison, academics, churches and faith groups have campaigned to get the contract stopped.</p> <p>G4S is not only finalising a contract which will privatise humanitarian housing provided by councils for the past 50 years. More importantly, perhaps, G4S is also a company which has managed detention centres, and provided escorts for deportees \u2013 in fact three of its escort staff are at present on bail facing criminal charges relating to the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/jimmy-mubenga\" title=\"\">Jimmy Mubenga</a>, an Angolan man.<br><strong>John Grayson</strong><br><em>South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008 Far from eroding the public policing function, private companies could bolster it. Private involvement in policing is already widespread, and greater use of civilians has improved services and reduced waste. In many areas, civilians have freed up resources otherwise spent on expensive officers to do jobs in business support and control rooms that do not require warranted powers.</p> <p>Our research supports the view of Ian Blair (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/04/chance-to-modernise-police-force\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 5 March) that there is scope to go much further. There are at least 7,000 officers currently in roles that could be filled by civilians, thereby costing an extra \u00a3150m every year. But cost savings are a by-product of outsourcing, not the objective. The real aim is to free up officers \u2013 the most valuable asset a force has \u2013 to fight crime.</p> <p>We can all work to prevent crime, but only warranted officers can arrest offenders and that special power should never be given away. But any reform that puts more officers in a position to fight crime should be seen as an opportunity, not a threat.<br><strong>Blair Gibbs</strong><br><em>Crime and justice unit, Policy Exchange</em></p> <p>\u2022 How is privatisation of parts of our public services presented as a means of making cuts and saving money (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/04/police-privatisation-plans-defend-acpo\" title=\"\">Police chiefs say privatisation 'only way' to tackle cuts</a>, 5 March)? I can see how there might be cuts: in numbers of jobs; in status and wages of the staff in the newly created private companies; and probably in their employment and pension rights. But let's ask how these private companies make their profits. And why should they, when it is our taxes that are providing their business income? I imagine there will be no cuts to the aspired salaries and bonuses of the company directors.</p> <p>Less desirable cuts will be to the Inland Revenue and National Insurance coffers, once the privatised sections of the police have set up their businesses with offshore money, huge tax-avoidance schemes arranged for the directors and managers, and an employment pool of low-paid staff or consultants on short contracts paying far less tax than our current police's PAYE. And when it all goes belly-up, there will be a hugely expensive inquiry or two,&#xa0;no doubt paid for by us, the public, and the fat cats will walk away scot-free.<br><strong>Dr Susan H Treagus</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Ian Blair declares his hand as chairman of Bluelight Global Solutions, a company formed by ex-senior police officers. They include Bob Quick, ex-assistant commissioner for the Met police, Paul Hancock, ex-chief constable for Bedfordshire constabulary, and Bill Hughes, ex-director of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. It is no surprise that they advocate private-sector delivery of police functions now that they make their money from the private sector. <br><strong>Paul Richards</strong><br><em>Eastbourne, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Having spent much of the 90s working as a detective and witnessing first-hand the effect that the then newly created performance targets had, I can easily envisage the future of minor crime investigation.

      "bodyText": "The government is struggling to keep a united front on plans to save \u00a32.5bn by withdrawing child benefit from higher rate taxpayers, in one of the first major policy clashes in the coalition government between No 10 and the Treasury. George Osborne is making clear in Whitehall that his proposal is a popular way of showing that all income earners will share in the pain of deficit reduction. The chancellor is also saying that the public finances are so tight it would be difficult to fund a watering down of the change, which is due to be introduced in January 2013. David Cameron, nervous about unsettling Middle Britain, is keen to deal with the \"cliff edge\" problem of removing child benefit the moment at least one parent's income reaches the 40% tax threshold of \u00a342,745 a year. No 10 is alarmed that a family with one earner, whose income is just short of \u00a343,000, loses the benefit while a family in which both parents have a joint income of just over \u00a380,000 will be unaffected if neither is taxed at 40%. Kenneth Clarke, the former chancellor, waded into the row on Monday when he said Osborne had been right to tell the Conservative party conference in 2010 that higher rate taxpayers should not enjoy such a generous benefit in such a bleak economic climate. \"It is quite wrong that some people are paying the higher rate of income tax on the basis that they're above average earners and at the same time receiving a social benefit to help them pay for their children,\" Clarke, the justice secretary, told ITV News. \"It's an anomaly which, at a time of acute financial crisis, was bound to be addressed.\" Clarke indicated that some minor changes might be announced by the chancellor in his budget on 21 March or in his autumn statement in November, but said there would be no U-turn. \"I am sure the details can be looked at but the idea the government's going to do a U-turn on that is ridiculous,\" Clarke said. \"We are in the middle of an acute financial crisis. It's very hard on the families but they are higher rate taxpayers. We've all got, I'm afraid, to find that we're tightening our belt a bit to get ourselves out of the mess we're in to get the economy recovering again.\" Clarke spoke out after Nick Clegg indicated the government was looking to amend its plans. Speaking on Sky News, the deputy prime minister said: \"We have been very open as a government that it is right that people at the top who earn much more than people with average incomes should be asked to make an extra sacrifice and that it is justifiable to say that people at the top don't receive child benefit in the way people do on ordinary incomes. \"But we're also equally accepting that there's an issue about how you do that so you make sure you don't create unintended consequences where, say, a family with one earner gets child benefit removal when there's another family with income earners who actually collectively earn more but keep the benefit.\" The intervention by the Liberal Democrat leader prompted speculation that he was adding child benefit to a list of demands his party is tabling ahead of the budget. But it is understood Clegg simply thought he was helping out the prime minister, who has spoken publicly of the need for a rethink on child benefit. Clegg's main priority is still to take low income earners out of tax by raising the income tax allowance to \u00a310,000, to be funded by a tax on wealth. The nerves in Downing Street come as Tory MPs vowed to oppose the change. Stewart Jackson, who resigned as a ministerial aide last year over Europe, dismissed the policy as \"barmy, tokenistic and unfair\". He said: \"We understand that tough decisions have to be made and that there has to be burden-sharing across all groups. What's a problem for the government is seeming to clobber hard-working people, including single parents, while at the same time uprating benefits by over 5%. \"The Rolls Royce minds at the Treasury need to find a way out of the mire. If not, they need to drop the whole policy. It holds against basic tenets of fairness and equity.\" The prime minister voiced his concerns about the child benefit changes in January when he said he would examine the way in which the withdrawal of child benefit kicks in so quickly. He told the House Magazine: \"Some people say that's the unfairness of it, that you lose the child benefit if you have a higher rate taxpayer in the family. Two people below the level keep the benefit. So there's a threshold, a cliff-edge issue. \"We always said we would look at the steepness of the curve. We always said we would look at the way it's implemented and that remains the case, but again I don't want to impinge on the chancellor's budget.\" Osborne is making clear that he has little room for manoeuvre after the slower than expected economic recovery forced him to delay by a year his initial pledge to eliminate the structural deficit within the lifetime of this parliament. The chancellor had thought in 2010 there was a strong chance he would never have to introduce the change. But he is now saying that the proposal, which will only affect 15% of taxpayers, is popular even among those who pay tax at 40% or more. He is also saying that introducing major changes would be difficult. Changes to his original plan could include: raising the cap so that child benefit is only withdrawn from those earning more than \u00a350,000; allowing parents with children under the age of five to keep the benefit; or lessening the impact on families with one earner who pays tax at 40%. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: \"The government's policy on child benefit is now in total disarray. These unfair changes are due to hit hundreds of thousands of families on middle incomes in just 10 months time. The chancellor must now put implementation of these plans on hold and announce an urgent review. \"It cannot be right that a two-earner family each earning \u00a342,000, a total of \u00a384,000, would keep all their child benefit, but a single-earner family on \u00a343,000 would lose it all at a stroke. And if ministers can look again at cutting child benefit for families on \u00a343,000 they should also reconsider perverse and unfair cuts to tax credits for parents on the minimum wage which will leave thousands not only worse off, but better off if they quit work.\"",

      "bodyText": "It is a paradox of the history of British migration that, while the first generation of postwar black immigrants came to this country to work, unemployment among their children and grandchildren is stubbornly high. Figures I've just received from the Labour Force Survey reveal that unemployment among young black people (aged 16-24) is a shocking 44% \u2013 over twice the rate of their white counterparts, of whom 20% are jobless. Black and Asian migrants after the war helped rebuild the economy: working in factories; doing the night shifts; working on the railways and driving the buses. And a generation of West Indian women made a contribution to the health service that has never been properly celebrated. So whatever else the problem is, black Britons don't come from households that didn't value work. One of the causes of high black unemployment is shared by working class males whatever their colour. Structural changes in the economy mean that the type of blue-collar jobs that the first generation of migrants did no longer exists. When I was a child, areas like Willesden and Park Royal in north-west London were full of manufacturing and light-engineering factories. The large black community there owes its existence partly to just those employment opportunities. But these jobs have largely vanished from London. My father came to this country in the 1950s having left school in Jamaica at 14. But he was able to find factory work and rise to become a sheet metal worker with his own apprentices. Now there are no job opportunities for young people without formal qualifications. A generation ago it was still possible to leave school at 16 and become a bank clerk, a nurse, a local government officer. Now many employers recruiting for similar roles demand a degree. There is no question that a lack of qualifications holds some young black people back. But there is anecdotal evidence that black people emerging from university with the same qualifications as their white peers find it much more difficult to get employment. Lack of qualifications alone does not account for this level of unemployment. What is clear is that this recession is hitting ethnic minorities disproportionately hard. And the figures can only get worse. Black people, particularly women, are more likely to work in the public sector. This is partly because in diverse inner-city areas the public sector is the biggest employer. But it is also because large public-sector organisations tend to have better, more transparent policies around equal opportunity. Yet the public sector is bearing the brunt of George Osborne's cuts. In recent decades black people have made advances in all kinds of employment. But the Americans have a saying: \"Last to be hired, first to be fired\". This may be reflected in some of the racial disparities that are emerging. Some people will be antagonised by any discussion of the fact that spiralling unemployment is hitting black people hardest. They may think it a price worth paying for cutting back on public spending. Or they may argue that it doesn't matter what colour you are. But the more unequal a society, the more unstable it is. And inequality with a racial dimension risks creating a time bomb. The immediate response to last summer's riots was (quite correctly) a call to restore order. But these figures are not irrelevant. Policymakers cannot afford to ignore black unemployment. Hardworking immigrant grandparents would not want special treatment for this generation: after all, they themselves did not have any. But they would expect this society to care, and be prepared to examine carefully what the underlying reasons might be. That generation of migrants were God-fearing monarchists. So they would expect fairness and justice. And as their grandchildren might put it: \"No Justice, No Peace\". \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree \u2022 This article was critised by Channel 4's FactCheck.

      "bodyText": "Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has responded to Barack Obama's call for an end to \"loose talk of war\" and bluster over Iran by reiterating Israel's \"right to defend itself\". At the start of what appeared to be an uneasy meeting at the White House \u2013 at which Obama was expected to press the Israeli leader to stall any military action against Iran until sanctions have had an opportunity to persuade Tehran to open up its nuclear programme \u2013 Netanyahu did not waver from his insistence that he will decide whether to attack. \"When it comes to Israel's security, Israel has the sovereign right to make its own decisions. I believe that's why you appreciate, Mr President, that Israel must reserve the right to defend itself,\" he said. \"After all, that's the very purpose of the Jewish state, to restore to the Jewish people control over our destiny. And that's why my supreme responsibility as prime minister of Israel is to ensure that Israel remains the master of its fate.\" Netanyahu arrived in Washington planning to press Obama to commit to military action against Iran if it crosses specified \"red lines\" in development of its nuclear programme, or if it fails to meet demands to dismantle its underground nuclear facility in Qom and halt uranium enrichment. US officials say the president does not want to make any such commitment, even though he says the military option remains on the table, out of concern that it will be seen as implicitly endorsing an Israeli attack if the demands are not met. Instead, Obama spoke of the \"difficult months\" ahead as he appealed for more time for sanctions to persuade Tehran to co-operate with international inspectors and demonstrate that it is not planning to build a nuclear bomb. \"It is profoundly in the United States' interest as well to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,\" Obama said. \"That's why we have worked so diligently to set up the most crippling sanctions ever with respect to Iran. We do believe there is still a window that allows for a diplomatic resolution to this issue, but ultimately the Iranians' regime has to make a decision to move in that direction, a decision that they have not made thus far. \"My policy is prevention of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons \u2026 When I say all options are at the table, I mean it. Having said that, I know that both the prime minister and I prefer to resolve this diplomatically. We understand the costs of any military action.\" The meeting follows Obama's speech on Sunday to America's powerful pro-Israel lobby group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), in which he demanded an end to the \"loose talk of war\" and \"bluster\" against Iran \u2013 a clear reference to the noise coming out of Netanyahu's government. The Israeli prime minister is to address Aipac on Monday evening. Obama, who has repeatedly and defensively asserted his support for the Jewish state in recent days, also said he \"has Israel's back\" \u2013 a reassurance he repeated to Netanyahu at the White House. \"The bond between our two countries is unbreakable,\" he said. \"Our commitment to the security of Israel is rock solid. And as I've said to the prime minister in every single one of our meetings, the United States will always have Israel's back when it comes to Israel's security.\" Netanyahu, too, sought to emphasise the close ties, even while offering no reassurance to Obama \u2013 in public at least \u2013 that he is prepared to give sanctions the length of opportunity the US president would like. \"Americans know that Israel and the United States share common values, that we defend common interests, that we face common enemies. Iran's leaders know that, too. For them, you're the Great Satan, we're the Little Satan. For them, we are you and you're us. And you know something, Mr President \u2013 at least on this last point, I think they're right. We are you, and you are us,\" Netanyahu said. The encounter was infused with some of the chill that has characterised the relationship since the pair first met as leaders three years ago and Obama mistakenly thought he could press Netanyahu into halting the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank \u2013 a major obstacle to serious peace talks with the Palestinians. Last year, Netanyahu humiliated Obama by lecturing him in public at the White House on the Holocaust and Israel's history. The two sides were clearly determined to paper over the differences on Iran as best they could, although a White House proposal to issue a joint statement of intent after the talks looked uncertain. Tellingly, Obama made only a brief reference to the Palestinian issue and Netanyahu said nothing about it at all, demonstrating how much it has been sidelined by the Iran crisis, to the Israeli leadership's gratification. The US president's speech to Aipac received a mixed reaction in Israel and the US. Ayoub Kara, a deputy minister and member of Netanyahu's Likud party, criticised Obama over his warning against loose talk of war and bluster. \"There is a saying that it's easier to watch a fire from far away,\" he said. \"We, not the US, are facing an existential threat. If Israel doesn't bluster, the US will also be in danger, because Iran's missiles will reach them too. Israel is doing everything possible to keep the world safe, and it's unfortunate that the White House doesn't see things the way we see them here.\" But the Israeli opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, blamed Netanyahu for deteriorating relations with Obama. \"Relations between Israel and the US have become political during Netanyahu's term,\" she said. \"Netanyahu made Israel an issue in the American election and it's a mistake. Netanyahu must understand that relations with the US are an essential need. Our deterrence depends on it. He will be tested on whether he is able to draft the US into our interests or whether he will continue just manipulating internal American politics.\" At the Aipac conference on Monday, the veteran but soon-to-be-ex senator Joe Lieberman said the choice as to whether military action is used is Iran's \u2013 but Lieberman was not shy of proposing the use of force. \"So far, though economic sanctions applied have clearly affected the Iranian economy, the fact is they haven't led the fanatics who today run that country to slow up their nuclear weapons programme one iota,\" he said. \"The Iranian regime must hear a message from us and we must state it loud and clear: either you peacefully negotiate an end to your illicit nuclear activities or they will be ended for you by military attack.\" But opinion in Washington is divided. The Israeli leadership arrived in the city to be confronted by a full-page ad in the Washington Post signed by retired US generals and intelligence officers declaring: Mr President: Say No to War of Choice with Iran. \"Military action at this stage is not only unnecessary, it is dangerous \u2013 for the United States and for Israel,\" it says above the names of five former army and marine corps generals. Much of the American public appears to agree. A Pew Research poll released on Monday said 51% of Americans want the US to stay neutral if Israel attacks Iran.",

      "bodyText": "Liberal Democrats and Tories have set out details of how hospitals will be monitored to stop them chasing private patients at the expense of NHS provision. Foundation trusts will need to seek the support of their board directors before they expand private sector income , up to the legal maximum of 49% of total income. Labour denounced the proposals as \"a dirty deal\" designed to fool the Liberal Democrat spring conference this weekend, but the Conservatives said they represented reassurance ahead of key debates on the health bill later this week. The health minister Earl Howe gave assurances that the health regulator, Monitor, would have enduring powers over a foundation trust to take (or not to take) particular action to ensure continuity of NHS services. In exceptional cases, Monitor would be able to require a trust to suspend, remove or replace directors or governors to address a serious breach of licence conditions, Howe said. But after April 2016 Monitor would not have the direct power to remove a trust director. Regarding the private income cap, the current bill requires foundation trust directors to set out in their annual plans any projected activities to earn non-NHS income, including from private patients, and the income they expect to earn from those activities. Under the proposed amendments, a board of governors would have to be satisfied that any such plans would not to \"any significant extent\" interfere with the trust's principal legal purpose of providing NHS services. It also states that plans to significantly increase non-NHS income \u2013 that is, to increase by 5 percentage points or more the proportion of total income earned from non-NHS work \u2013 would have to be agreed by a majority of the governors in a vote. So a vote would be triggered, for example, if the proportion of a trust's non-NHS income were to increase from 2% to 7% or more of its total income. Governors would also be able to require directors to attend a special meeting where they could vote on motions about the performance of their trust and of its directors.",

In exceptional cases, Monitor would be able to require a trust to suspend, remove or replace directors or governors to address a serious breach of licence conditions, Howe said.</p> <p>But after April 2016 Monitor would not have the direct power to remove a trust director.</p> <p>Regarding the private income cap, the current bill requires foundation trust directors to set out in their annual plans any projected activities to earn non-NHS income, including from private patients, and the income they expect to earn from those activities.</p> <p>Under the proposed amendments, a board of governors would have to be satisfied that any such plans would not to \"any significant extent\" interfere with the trust's principal legal purpose of providing NHS services. It also states that plans to significantly increase non-NHS income \u2013 that is, to increase by 5 percentage points or more the proportion of total income earned from non-NHS work \u2013 would have to be agreed by a majority of the governors in a vote.

      "bodyText": "The publication of documents outlining the risks relating to the government's health changes could lead to a \"distorted and wildly speculative interpretation of risk\", according to the permanent secretary of the Department of Health. Una O'Brien also warned that publishing the documents would have a \"chilling effect\" on the way civil servants tasked with outlining the potential pitfalls of a policy commit their views to paper, as the government fights to keep secret the contents of its risk assessments of the government's shakeup of the NHS. O'Brien was giving evidence to the information rights tribunal as the government seeks to overturn a November ruling by the information commissioner, Christopher Graham, who ordered the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, to release his department's risk assessment of the potential dangers of his radical shakeup. It follows two separate freedom of information (FoI) requests lodged more than a year ago for the strategic risk register (February 2011) and the transition programme risk register (November 2010) to be made public. Graham said in his ruling that disclosure of the two documents would significantly aid public understanding of risks related to the proposed changes and it would also inform participation in the debate about the reorganisation. John Healey, the former shadow health secretary who submitted an FoI for the transition risk register, will say in his statement to the appeal tribunal that amid widening opposition to the legislative plan \"the need for reassurance about the possible consequences\" of the shakeup is \"greater now than when I made my disclosure request\". But O'Brien spelt out her \"deep concerns\" that if the contents of the registers were made public at this stage, it would remove the \"safe space\" in which civil servants could be frank to ministers about the worst case scenarios of a given policy. She said that while her instinct was to provide information, there needed to be a relationship of trust between civil servants and ministers where they were confident their assessments would not be disclosed. Her \"subsidiary\" concern was that the contents of the documents \"might be interpreted and mispresented\". She said risk registers were \"living documents\" that presented a snapshot in time that changed as the policy was developed, and warned that \"if taken out of context, my own judgment is that they would lead to a distorted and wildly speculative interpretation of risk\". Her comments were backed by Lord O'Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, who said that the risk registers were by nature asymmetric because they were designed to guide policymakers to think about the various aspects of improving the policy. O'Donnell, who retired in December, said: \"It will understate the probability of very good outcomes \u2026 and it will overstate in people's minds the probability of very bad outcomes because the whole point of a scenario and analysis that you do is to think about the unthinkable.\" He said the registers were put together at a very early stage and were littered with red, in reference to the traffic light system of risk levels applied. But he said this was as it should be. \"In fact, if you're going for a big reform programme, if it didn't have a whole series of reds, I would say there is almost certainly something with that risk register, by definition.\" Had the documents been published, he warned that it would have adversely affected the public debate. \"There are very very strong public interest reasons for a department like health being able to formulate its policy the best it can,\" he said. \"And when the permanent secretary tells you that actually with disclosing these risk registers we would end up with a worse policy that worries me.\" Last month a Labour motion calling on ministers to release the risk register associated with the health and social care bill was defeated in the Commons. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham told the Commons last month that the regional and local risk registers, which have been published, were \"appalling and shocking\". Some of the regional risk registers \"predict poorer treatment for cancer patients\", he said. Burnham told MPs: \"If this is what is published in local risk registers, it begs the question what on earth are they trying to hide in the national assessment? The simple truth is this: they can't publish because if people knew the full facts it would demolish any residual support that this reorganisation might have.\" But he was criticised during the debate after it emerged that he had opposed the publication of a risk register while he was health secretary.",

It was made more absurd because Number 10 spent days denying that he had actually mounted Raisa. In the end, he admitted that he had been up in the saddle, passing things off as \"a confusing picture\".

But they hate to be mocked. Oh, Labour tried to cash in. But not very hard and by the end Cameron was making his own horse jokes.

He had been ignored in the crucial discussions. \"The best his spokesman could say is 'the prime minister will not be in the room, but he will be in the building'.\" \"He's like Elvis!\" Ed added confusingly.

      "bodyText": "It has a fair claim to be the ugliest philosophy the postwar world has produced. Selfishness, it contends, is good, altruism evil, empathy and compassion are irrational and destructive. The poor deserve to die; the rich deserve unmediated power. It has already been tested, and has failed spectacularly and catastrophically. Yet the belief system constructed by Ayn Rand, who died 30 years ago today, has never been more popular or influential. Rand was a Russian from a prosperous family who emigrated to the United States. Through her novels (such as Atlas Shrugged) and her nonfiction (such as The Virtue of Selfishness) she explained a philosophy she called Objectivism. This holds that the only moral course is pure self-interest. We owe nothing, she insists, to anyone, even to members of our own families. She described the poor and weak as \"refuse\" and \"parasites\", and excoriated anyone seeking to assist them. Apart from the police, the courts and the armed forces, there should be no role for government: no social security, no public health or education, no public infrastructure or transport, no fire service, no regulations, no income tax. Atlas Shrugged, published in 1957, depicts a United States crippled by government intervention in which heroic millionaires struggle against a nation of spongers. The millionaires, whom she portrays as Atlas holding the world aloft, withdraw their labour, with the result that the nation collapses. It is rescued, through unregulated greed and selfishness, by one of the heroic plutocrats, John Galt. The poor die like flies as a result of government programmes and their own sloth and fecklessness. Those who try to help them are gassed. In a notorious passage, she argues that all the passengers in a train filled with poisoned fumes deserved their fate. One, for instance, was a teacher who taught children to be team players; one was a mother married to a civil servant, who cared for her children; one was a housewife \"who believed that she had the right to elect politicians, of whom she knew nothing\". Rand's is the philosophy of the psychopath, a misanthropic fantasy of cruelty, revenge and greed. Yet, as Gary Weiss shows in his new book, Ayn Rand Nation, she has become to the new right what Karl Marx once was to the left: a demigod at the head of a chiliastic cult. Almost one third of Americans, according to a recent poll, have read Atlas Shrugged, and it now sells hundreds of thousands of copies every year. Ignoring Rand's evangelical atheism, the Tea Party movement has taken her to its heart. No rally of theirs is complete without placards reading \"Who is John Galt?\" and \"Rand was right\". Rand, Weiss argues, provides the unifying ideology which has \"distilled vague anger and unhappiness into a sense of purpose\". She is energetically promoted by the broadcasters Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and Rick Santelli. She is the guiding spirit of the Republicans in Congress. Like all philosophies, Objectivism is absorbed, secondhand, by people who have never read it. I believe it is making itself felt on this side of the Atlantic: in the clamorous new demands to remove the 50p tax band for the very rich, for instance; or among the sneering, jeering bloggers who write for the Telegraph and the Spectator, mocking compassion and empathy, attacking efforts to make the word a kinder place. It is not hard to see why Rand appeals to billionaires. She offers them something that is crucial to every successful political movement: a sense of victimhood. She tells them that they are parasitised by the ungrateful poor and oppressed by intrusive, controlling governments. It is harder to see what it gives the ordinary teabaggers, who would suffer grievously from a withdrawal of government. But such is the degree of misinformation which saturates this movement and so prevalent in the US is Willy Loman syndrome (the gulf between reality and expectations) that millions blithely volunteer themselves as billionaires' doormats. I wonder how many would continue to worship at the shrine of Ayn Rand if they knew that towards the end of her life she signed on for both Medicare and social security. She had railed furiously against both programmes, as they represented everything she despised about the intrusive state. Her belief system was no match for the realities of age and ill health. But they have a still more powerful reason to reject her philosophy: as Adam Curtis's BBC documentary showed last year, the most devoted member of her inner circle was Alan Greenspan, former head of the US Federal Reserve. Among the essays he wrote for Rand were those published in a book he co-edited with her called Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal. Here, starkly explained, you'll find the philosophy he brought into government. There is no need for the regulation of business \u2013 even builders or Big Pharma \u2013 he argued, as \"the 'greed' of the businessman or, more appropriately, his profit-seeking \u2026 is the unexcelled protector of the consumer\". As for bankers, their need to win the trust of their clients guarantees that they will act with honour and integrity. Unregulated capitalism, he maintains, is a \"superlatively moral system\". Once in government, Greenspan applied his guru's philosophy to the letter, cutting taxes for the rich, repealing the laws constraining banks, refusing to regulate the predatory lending and the derivatives trading which eventually brought the system down. Much of this is already documented, but Weiss shows that in the US, Greenspan has successfully airbrushed history. Despite the many years he spent at her side, despite his previous admission that it was Rand who persuaded him that \"capitalism is not only efficient and practical but also moral\", he mentioned her in his memoirs only to suggest that it was a youthful indiscretion \u2013 and this, it seems, is now the official version. Weiss presents powerful evidence that even today Greenspan remains her loyal disciple, having renounced his partial admission of failure to Congress. Saturated in her philosophy, the new right on both sides of the Atlantic continues to demand the rollback of the state, even as the wreckage of that policy lies all around. The poor go down, the ultra-rich survive and prosper. Ayn Rand would have approved. Twitter: @georgemonbiot A fully referenced version of this article can be found at www.monbiot.com",

Apart from the police, the courts and the armed forces, there should be no role for government: no social security, no public health or education, no public infrastructure or transport, no fire service, no regulations, no income tax.</p> <p>Atlas Shrugged, published in 1957, depicts a United States crippled by government intervention in which heroic millionaires struggle against a nation of spongers. The millionaires, whom she portrays as Atlas holding the world aloft, withdraw their labour, with the result that the nation collapses. It is rescued, through unregulated greed and selfishness, by one of the heroic plutocrats, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galt\" title=\"\">John Galt</a>.</p> <p>The poor die like flies as a result of government programmes and their own sloth and fecklessness. Those who try to help them are gassed. In a notorious passage, she argues that all the passengers in a train filled with poisoned fumes deserved their fate. One, for instance, was a teacher who taught children to be team players; one was a mother married to a civil servant, who cared for her children; one was a housewife \"who believed that she had the right to elect politicians, of whom she knew nothing\".</p> <p>Rand's is the philosophy of the psychopath, a misanthropic fantasy of cruelty, revenge and greed. Yet, as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Weiss\" title=\"\">Gary Weiss</a> shows in his new book, Ayn Rand Nation, she has become to the new right what Karl Marx once was to the left: a demigod at the head of a <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chiliasm\" title=\"\">chiliastic</a> cult. Almost one third of Americans, according to a recent poll, have read Atlas Shrugged, and it now sells hundreds of thousands of copies every year.</p> <p>Ignoring Rand's evangelical atheism, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tea-party-movement\" title=\"\">the Tea Party movement</a> has taken her to its heart. No rally of theirs is complete&#xa0;without placards reading \"Who is John Galt?\" and \"Rand was right\". Rand, Weiss argues, provides the&#xa0;unifying ideology which has \"distilled vague anger and unhappiness into a sense of purpose\". She is energetically promoted by the broadcasters Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and Rick Santelli. She is the guiding spirit of the Republicans in Congress.</p> <p>Like all philosophies, Objectivism is absorbed, secondhand, by people who have never read it. I believe it is making itself felt on this side of the Atlantic: in the clamorous new demands to remove the 50p tax band for the very rich, for instance; or among the sneering, jeering bloggers who write for the Telegraph and the Spectator, mocking compassion and empathy, attacking efforts to make the word a kinder place.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why Rand appeals&#xa0;to billionaires. She offers them&#xa0;something that is crucial to every&#xa0;successful political movement: a sense of victimhood. She tells them that they are parasitised by the ungrateful poor and oppressed by intrusive, controlling governments.</p> <p>It is harder to see what it gives the ordinary teabaggers, who would suffer grievously from a withdrawal of&#xa0;government. But such is the degree of misinformation which saturates this movement and so prevalent in the US is Willy Loman syndrome (the gulf between reality and expectations) that millions blithely volunteer themselves as billionaires' doormats. I wonder how many would continue to worship at the shrine of Ayn Rand if they knew that towards the end of her life she signed on for both Medicare and social security. She had railed furiously against both programmes, as they represented everything she despised about the intrusive state. Her belief system was no match for the realities of age and ill health.</p> <p>But they have a still more powerful reason to reject her philosophy: as Adam Curtis's BBC documentary showed last year, the most devoted member of her inner circle was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan\" title=\"\">Alan Greenspan</a>, former head of the US Federal Reserve. Among the essays he wrote for Rand were those published in a book he co-edited with her called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism:_The_Unknown_Ideal\" title=\"\">Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal</a>. Here, starkly explained, you'll find the philosophy he brought into government. There is no need for the regulation of business \u2013 even builders or Big Pharma \u2013 he argued, as \"the 'greed' of the businessman or, more appropriately, his profit-seeking \u2026 is the unexcelled protector of the consumer\". As for bankers, their need to win the trust of their clients guarantees that they will act with honour and integrity. Unregulated capitalism, he maintains, is a \"superlatively moral system\".</p> <p>Once in government, Greenspan applied his guru's philosophy to the letter, cutting taxes for the rich, repealing the laws constraining banks, refusing to regulate the predatory lending and the derivatives trading which eventually brought the system down. Much of this is already documented, but Weiss shows that in the US, Greenspan has successfully airbrushed history.</p> <p>Despite the many years he spent at her side, despite his previous admission that it was Rand who persuaded him that \"capitalism is not only efficient and practical but also moral\", he mentioned her in his memoirs only to suggest that it was a youthful indiscretion \u2013 and this, it seems, is now the official version. Weiss presents powerful evidence that even today Greenspan remains her loyal disciple, having renounced his partial admission of failure to Congress.</p> <p>Saturated in her philosophy, the new right on both sides of the Atlantic continues to demand the rollback of the state, even as the wreckage of that policy lies all around. The poor go down, the ultra-rich survive and prosper. Ayn Rand would have approved.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/georgemonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a></p> <p><em>A fully referenced version of this article can be found at </em><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\"><em>www.monbiot.com</em></a></p>",

It has nothing whatever, of course, to do with sex \u2013 but Olli Rehn, the European commissioner in charge of handling the eurozone debt crisis, has found himself accused of sexism after holding towel-clad briefings for male journalists in a sauna beneath his office in Brussels. It's hard to exaggerate the importance of the sauna in Rehn's native Finnish culture. In a country of 5.3 million people, the national statistics office estimates there are currently some 3m saunas, rather more than there are cars. Every apartment block sports one for the use of its residents; many individual flats do, too. Factories, corporate HQs, town halls, schools and hospitals have saunas; the Finnish parliament has a whole separate wing with multiple saunas and showers. According to health ministry figures, 95% of Finns have had a sauna by their second birthday and the average Finn takes 1.5 saunas a week (and more on holiday; a sauna is an essential part of every Finnish sea or lakeside summer cottage). Popular TV series have been set in saunas; Finnish academics publish doctoral theses on the subject with titles such as The Ions and Electric Charge of Sauna Air and Adolescents' Images of Sauna and Finnishness. In times past, the sauna was a practical and versatile addition to any Finnish home: you could smoke fish and meat on its stove, wash in it during the long winter when there was no running water, launder clothes, dry linen, sleep in it (when it had cooled down). Life began in a sauna: it was the cleanest place to give birth. And it ended there: the bodies of the dead were laid out and washed in the sauna. Like many Finns, Olli Rehn's father was born in a sauna. Abroad, Finns take their saunas with them. A second-world-war military manual set at eight hours the time needed for a battalion of Finnish soldiers to build a brace of saunas, heat them up and bathe in them. According to the foreign secretary, Pertti Torstila, Finnish peacekeepers have done just that on missions to such unfrozen environs as Egypt, Eritrea, Lebanon, Cyprus, Namibia, Liberia and Chad, as well as in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo. A whole language has evolved. Sauna itself, to start with; about the only word of this notoriously impenetrable language to have been successfully exported. L\u00f6yly is the word for the steam given off when you throw water on the hot stones on top of the sauna stove; it's different from the regular word for steam and has its roots in the word for spirit, breath, even soul. Vihta or vasta is the bunch of birch leaves with which, in season, you can gently beat yourself. If you're lucky, the sauna elf (saunatonttu) may call. But \u2013 and here's the thing \u2013 unless they are part of the same family, or very old and very good friends, Finnish men and women rarely take saunas together. \"The rules,\" says Timo Martikainen of the Finnish Sauna Society, \"are instinctive. It's difficult to be definitive. But generally, if a sauna is mixed, people will keep their swimming costumes on, although that's not very comfortable. You don't misbehave in a sauna in Finland. Sauna is almost sacred.\" So mostly, the sauna experience is a same-sex experience. In some societies, that could be a problem. The sauna has, after all, long been Finland's favoured forum for informal \u2013 but often important \u2013 discussion and negotiation. I once interviewed a Finnish interior ministry official in a sauna, and sauna diplomacy is a longstanding Finnish tradition; all 98 Finnish diplomatic and consular missions around the world have their own saunas. In a memorable speech to the 15th annual International Sauna Congress a couple of years ago, Torstila gave some examples. Former president Martti Ahtisaari, the Finnish Nobel peace prize laureate of 2008, \"used sauna diplomacy from Tanzania to Indonesia\", Tostila said. And during the cold war, Urho Kekkonen, president for more than 25 years, famously negotiated Finland's delicate diplomatic escape from under the Soviet shadow in the sauna at his official residence. On one occasion, in 1960, he kept Nikita Kruschev sweating there until five in the morning \u2013 when Moscow issued an unexpected communique \"expressing preparedness to support Finland's desire to integrate with the west\". Years later, in 1978, Kekkonen enlisted the help of the sauna to talk Soviet defence minister Dmitri Ustinov out of the unpalatable idea of joint military manoeuvres. For, as Torstila explains, in the sauna \"all are equal. There are no superpowers or minipowers in a sauna, no superiors or servants. You don't keep your politics up your sleeve when you are not wearing sleeves. If you discuss and agree on something when you are all naked, it's difficult later not to keep your word.\" Former foreign minister Alexander Stubb is blunter: \"At work I try to use the sauna strategy as well,\" he admitted in his book The Naked Truth. \"I cordially invite my colleagues into the sauna. Then I don't let them out until everyone agrees with my legislation.\" But what, though, if some of his colleagues are women? In Brussels, the structural sexism of the sauna may indeed be a bit of an issue. But not, on the whole, in Finland, the first country in Europe to give women the vote. Here, more than 40% of MPs are women. Some 67% of women work (against 70% of men), and the world's first government made up of a majority of women ministers was installed in 2007. Tarja Halonen, the country's female president for the past 12 years (until last week, in fact), has two saunas in her summer residence in Naantali. In Finland, if anyone is likely to get upset about being locked out of the sauna, it's the men.",

The chancellor preens himself when loyal members of the Court of George remind him of his masterstroke in the autumn of 2007 when he pledged to raise the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m. This spooked Gordon Brown who then abandoned plans to hold an early general election. Osborne regarded his announcement at the 2010 Conservative conference to withdraw child benefit from higher rate taxpayers as another masterstroke. It would be a vivid demonstration of his \"we're all in it together\" approach to tackling Britain's record fiscal deficit. But there was a second, less publicised, element to his plan. One senior Tory sidled up to me after Osborne's announcement and said that the chancellor hoped that he would never have to introduce the change, due to come into effect in January 2013. A second masterstroke was meant to come towards the end of this year when Osborne would say that his economic strategy was working so well \u2013 and the private sector was picking up so strongly \u2013 that he was able to take the foot off the accelerator. There could be no uncosted tax cuts. But he could halt one planned piece of unpleasantness: child benefit would, after all, remain a universal benefit. This became impossible over the last 18 months when the slow economic recovery prompted the Office for Budget Responsibility to embark on a series of downgrades of its growth forecasts. The final nail was hammered into the coffin last November when Osborne was forced to concede in his autumn statement that he would not meet his informal target of eliminating the structural deficit over the course of this parliament.

Osborne is making clear that in the current economic climate it would be \"difficult\" to introduce major changes. He is also saying that withdrawing child benefit from higher rate taxpayers is actually a popular policy. There is much talk in Whitehall that the budget on 21 March is the last moment for the chancellor to flesh out a growth plan that can kick in before the 2015 election.

The family inhabit a windmill complex \u2013 in which, it turns out, there is at least as much grinding of teeth as flour. The family are trying to run a tea shop, gift shop, function room and rental cottages, and are having difficulty chewing the amount they have bitten off. Identifying a lack of focus is not the greatest of challenges for Polizzi. Andrew Mueller Prisoners' Wives 9pm, BBC1 An exhilarating conclusion to the superb, slow-burn series. As if she hadn't been magnificent enough, tonight Emma Rigby's visceral emoting may actually burst your television. Her character Gemma has quite the 24 hours as her narrative spirals out of control. Meanwhile, Harriet (the brilliant Pippa Haywood) starts to find her confidence and Franny (the regal Polly Walker) finds herself back on easy street, but at what price? The writing of this episode is supremely skilful and the direction is sublime. Addictive stuff. We'll be needing another series, thanks. Julia Raeside Horizon 9pm, BBC2 We know surprisingly little about our nearest star, the sun, but according to solar scientists it's time we caught up before we end up in a technological dark age. Every 11 years, the sun throws a kind of tantrum, spewing out electromagnetic radiation and plasma that can knock out power grids, destroy satellites and neutralise communication systems \u2013 all things our modern world relies on. Horizon meets the scientists who are trying to understand how it all works. Martin Skegg How To Build Britain's Secret Engineers 9pm, BBC4 This series has an especial resonance in an era in which many people make their livings by tapping computer keyboards to no tangible, three-dimensional effect \u2013 people who actually make actual stuff acquire a faintly heroic aspect. Tonight's episode meets the boffins at British defence contractor QinetiQ. Among the projects they're willing to expose to the cameras are stealth technologies that can render wind turbines less visible to radar and robots that can detect and defuse roadside bombs, and which may spare civilian humans from dangerous work back home. Andrew Mueller Storyville: Murderball 10pm, BBC4 If wheelchair rugby sounds somewhat unfeasible, be prepared to have your expectations challenged, your pulse quickened and your heartstrings tugged by this documentary following the rivalry between US and Canadian paraplegic teams in the run-up to the 2004 Paralympics in Athens. Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro's film comprehensively underlines the case that these men \u2013 who resemble the road warriors from Mad Max \u2013 are among the hardest people on the planet. Excellent. Ali Catterall Todd And The Book Of Pure Evil 10pm, Syfy This slacker-comedy-horror sounds promising on paper: an American high-school loser (Alex House) inherits a book (\"stitched together with the foreskin of Judas\") that grants him wishes, with hellish consequences for the whole school. In practice, though? Absolutely and appropriately diabolical. Cheap-looking, inexpertly directed and just completely unfunny, this stuff makes Troma look exceptional. Good to see Kevin Smith's muse Jason Mewes back on screen again, however, albeit in a wasted cameo. AJC",

Charlotte, Cambridge It means that fashion trends are now elected by an open and honest democratic election, Charlotte, during which the various competing trends take part in televised debates, chaired by Anna Wintour, in which each puts forward their reasons for being this season's Must Have. To wit: Neon: What the people of this country need is brightness. Britain is a grey country, and it has become even greyer under the aegis of the current trend, Victoriana. I say to you that a pop of neon into this nation's wardrobes is just what this nation needs. Wintour: Equestrian, would you like to respond to that? Equestrian: Yes I would. While it's fine to indulge in the pie-in-the-sky thinking of which Neon is so fond, let's stick to the facts here. British people don't wear neon. Never have, never will. It's just not practical. While brightness is a nice idea, one has to stay true to the heritage of this country, and that is what I bring to the table. British people will always enjoy paying homage to their past and I will encourage them to do that in a stylish, idealised manner, with tweeds and breeches and smart leather boots. That is what the British people want, that is what they need and that is what I can and will provide. Wintour: Naval, can you reply to that?

To wit:</p> <p><strong>Neon:</strong> What the people of this country need is brightness. Britain is a grey country, and it has become even greyer under the aegis of the current trend, Victoriana.

While it's fine to indulge in the pie-in-the-sky thinking of which Neon is so fond, let's stick to the facts here. British people don't wear neon. Never have, never will. It's just not practical. While brightness is a nice idea, one has to stay true to the heritage of this country, and that is what I bring to the table. British people will always enjoy paying homage to their past and I will encourage them to do that in a stylish, idealised manner, with tweeds and breeches and smart leather boots.

      "bodyText": "We are walking across the bright, airy atrium of a newly refurbished Victorian primary in south London. A little girl reading with a parent volunteer looks up and waves enthusiastically; the headteacher, my tour guide, grins and waves back. The school's positive atmosphere belies the difficulties that some of its pupils face. Half of students here are eligible for free school meals and 37 languages are spoken \u2013 \"which I think is incredibly enriching\", says the head. The headteacher \u2013 let's call him Mr Smith, as he has asked us not to identify his school \u2013 is about to introduce me to the manager of the school's child protection and family services unit. Smith started to fund in-school family support just over two years ago, he explains, because he felt there was not enough intervention by social services. He and his staff felt some of the children were showing signs of neglect that needed to be dealt with here and now, and that the level of need a child had to be experiencing before social services would take action was unacceptably high. In this school, judged \"outstanding\" by Ofsted, identifying and dealing with instances of neglect before they escalate is a high priority. The team \u2013 whose members have expertise in child protection, family support and early years development \u2013 focuses on issues many would think the responsibility of the local authority. This head believes the resource, deployed across his federation of four primaries, is probably still not enough to protect all his pupils from neglect and abuse. \"What frightens me is I think we're barely scratching the surface here, and that's with our heightened awareness and due diligence,\" he says. Neglect is hard to define. The school's deputy head recalls her dismay when a child arrived midway through the year \"really struggling with eating\". On investigation, it turned out his mother had never weaned him, instead crushing biscuits into milk and \"still bottle-feeding him at four years old\". Even with the exceptional on-site expertise now in place, she is \"always worried that you'll miss somebody\". \"It can be little things,\" says Clare, a reception teacher, \"that they're hungry every time they come into school, or eating crisps again. Very often it's non-verbal signs \u2013 appearance, the way they smell sometimes. We don't do homework, but if the family activities are never completed; if the reading diary is never filled in; if there's a stream of different people picking them up, even older siblings; all this stuff would pick up on my radar.\" It's not just physical signs and symptoms that teachers need to watch out for, however, says Joanne, who manages the special unit. \"I spent eight years doing early years before I did family work,\" she explains, \"and I think teachers need a very strong understanding of early years development because it's integral to recognising neglect. If a child is not meeting milestones, it's a sign that they may have experienced neglect in the past.\" The children's commissioner for England, Maggie Atkinson, is so concerned about how abuse and neglect are addressed in schools that she has commissioned research into how primaries are dealing with child protection concerns. New guidelines based on the findings will be published this autumn. Physical and sexual abuse may have a high profile, but \"neglect is not a softer issue\", emphasises Shaun Kelly, head of safeguarding at Action for Children (A4C). News coverage of the worst cases underlines his point \u2013 children who suffer from acute and sustained neglect can die. But even where it doesn't have such desperate outcomes, neglect can cause profound damage to children as they grow up. An NSPCC study published last year shows that 10% of 11- to 17-year-olds had suffered from severe neglect. Research carried out by the University of Stirling for A4C shows that although teachers and nursery staff are becoming more aware of neglect, they often feel unsure what to do when they suspect it is happening. The study, Child Neglect in 2011, found that four out of five professionals in universal services \u2013 including primary schoolteachers, pre-school and nursery staff \u2013 have suspected children of being neglected, and 55% of primary and 46% of pre-school and nursery staff said \"the most helpful improvement in tackling child neglect would be if they were able to report less serious suspicions before they became worse\". If a child comes into class bruised or with a cigarette burn, it's easy to see there's a potential problem. But neglect manifests over time, and often in subtle ways. Teachers may feel reluctant to report the small things that worry them if they don't feel confident their concerns will be taken seriously at senior level. They can also be anxious about getting it wrong. The emotional and practical demands on teachers, even with good support, can be considerable. Orla, a year 2 teacher at the school, says she spent much of last year in almost daily contact with the specialist team because of one child who had \"lots of issues\". She points out that eliciting information can be more complex when a child reaches an age where \"they become aware that if they tell you things, things can happen [to their family]\". In this school, having expert staff available takes the strain of making a difficult judgment call away from teachers and means the information is shared with experienced people who know what to do. Stopping neglect from escalating by being \"pre-emptive and active\" has become the priority, says Joanne. Every new member of staff gets a 90-minute session on safeguarding. \"We also do an inset dedicated to safeguarding every year, and we take people through a case scenario, explain how it was handled and then we'll talk about what might have been done differently.\" A robust reporting system is also vital for prevention and for building an evidence base for referrals. There are pink slips that teachers can fill in and hand to Joanne or her team. Staff feel that it is worth reporting the observations that niggle but don't necessarily shout \"neglect\", explains Clare. \"If they are getting five or six or 10 of those pink slips for a child, or for siblings, she can start to build up a picture,\" she says. With deep cuts affecting many services such as breakfast clubs and play schemes that might once have picked up on a family struggling to cope, this school-based resource is all the more crucial, says Joanne's colleague, Emma. The team offers intensive coaching to adults who may not have experienced good parenting themselves. They also put on sessions open to all, such as Parent Gym and the Family and Schools Together programme, to build trust between staff and parents. Early intervention, which can be done not just by social workers, but potentially in schools, should be a statutory requirement in cases of neglect, says Kelly. He points out that its cost-effectiveness has been proved, and \"with resources reducing rapidly, you're more likely to resource what your statutory duties are\". Because of the school's work, its local authority referral rates have dropped, but both Joanne and Emma are angry that social services are so stretched that the \"thresholds\" at which any action is taken are continually, they say, being raised. The A4C research shows that a large number of social workers are worried about how neglect is dealt with \u2013 more than 40% felt that the point at which they were able to intervene in cases was too late, and 80% thought that cuts to services would make the situation worse. More than half said that for children whose cases meet current thresholds, lack of resources was a barrier to them being able to act effectively. \"It's desperate ... I'm sure the local authority wouldn't like me to say that, but desperate, that's what it is,\" says Joanne. She points out that making the case to social services that a child is being neglected can be much harder than reporting other types of abuse, because neglect tends to be a slow-burn, corrosive narrative rather than a single, extreme incident. Having to convince an administrative officer staffing the phones, rather than a qualified social worker, does not, she says, help matters to progress quickly. At the University of Stirling, Professor Brigid Daniel, who supervised the A4C research, says she was struck by the extent of the safeguarding role teachers take on. \"People are quite clear that they do have responsibility,\" she says. \"There was a lot of anxiety around neglect ... but people also know that underlying it is a bigger concern \u2013 you're trying to stem a tide caused by much bigger issues, such as mental health, substance misuse and domestic abuse.\" \"I think you should take ultimate responsibility,\" says the south London head. \"Schools are the frontline, and not just when things go wrong, but all the time, proactively and not just responsively.\" \u2022 All names of those working in the primary school have been changed",

Last week, Limbaugh called Fluke, a Georgetown University law student, a \"prostitute\" and a \"slut\" after she testified before Congress about the need for insurance coverage for birth control. Having made the initial attack last Wednesday, Limbaugh followed up on Thursday by adding: \"So, Miss Fluke, if we are going to \u2026 pay for you to have sex, we want something for it. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.\" \"I should not have used the language I did, and it was wrong,\" Limbaugh told listeners on Monday. Advertisers began pulling their support immediately after the comments. Limbaugh apologised over the weekend for his comments, but immediately ran into more trouble as critics charged that his apology was insincere. \"I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress,\" he wrote on his website. \"My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologise to Ms Fluke for the insulting word choices.\" Fluke told ABC's The View that Limbaugh had been trying to silence her. She rejected the apology: \"I don't think that a statement like this, issued saying that his choice of words was not the best, changes anything. Especially when that statement is issued when he's under significant pressure from his sponsors, who have begun to pull support from his show.\" The remarks were condemned by president Barack Obama, who called Fluke to offer his support, and by John Boehner, Republican House speaker, who called them \"inappropriate\". AOL and Allstate were joined by two other advertisers that pulled their support after Limbaugh's apology, Carbonite and ProFlowers. \"No one with daughters the age of Sandra Fluke \u2013 and I have two \u2013 could possibly abide the insult and abuse heaped upon this courageous and well-intentioned young lady,\" the CEO of Carbonite, David Friend, said in a statement. \"Mr Limbaugh, with his highly personal attacks on Miss Fluke, overstepped any reasonable bounds of decency. Even though Mr Limbaugh has now issued an apology, we have nonetheless decided to withdraw our advertising from his show.\" ProFlowers also released a statement: \"We do not base our advertising decisions to align with any particular political view or opinion as our employees and customers are as diverse as the USA. Mr Limbaugh's recent comments went beyond political discourse to a personal attack and do not reflect our values as a company.\" Limbaugh is one of the biggest radio stars in the US and is estimated to make $50m a year from his programme. The show is owned by Premiere Radio Networks, part of media giant Clear Channel Communications. A Hawaii radio station on Monday announced it would no longer air Limbaugh's show. \"Regardless of one's political views on the issue being discussed, we feel the delivery was degrading and the continued comments over several days to be egregious. As a result, we are discontinuing the Rush Limbaugh program on KPUA effective immediately,\" president and general manager Chris Leonard said in a statement.",

      "bodyText": "I wonder if I can tell you about some rumours that are doing the rounds? First, we've all seen that you're going to perform that miracle much beloved by those who like measuring human beings: changing the pass level of exams. I come from an era when this was standard practice in the 11-plus exam. The pass level in any area wasn't a statement about how good or bad that cohort of children were. It was simply tied to how many grammar school places that particular local authority had created. The collective memory of this sort of thing makes people wonder, you know. I mean, there couldn't be a tiny possibility, could there, that the reason why you're fiddling around with exam pass levels is so that you can regulate the numbers of school students applying for university? After all, it has become quite embarrassing that thousands of young people we all thought were qualified to benefit from three years more education are now deemed not to be so, with the only visible reason for this shift in view being that you agree with the bankers that we can't \"afford\" that level of university provision. Handy for you, I suppose, if you can dampen a bit of the young people's ardour for more education by labelling more of them as failures. Talking of labelling people as failures, I see it's full steam ahead with June's phonics test. The results for your pilot tests are in and they make interesting reading. The pass level was put at 34 correct readings of the 40 single words. (I'm not sure why reading single words, not in sentences nor in passages of writing counts as \"reading\". Wouldn't it have been more honest to have called it a \"decode test\"?) Sad to say, only 32% of the children reached the pass score. Now, one rumour I heard was that even the \"outstanding schools\" that did the pilot scored at this sort of a level. If so, will your new head of Ofsted have to change the word \"outstanding\" to \"crap\"? He's rather good at that sort of thing, isn't he? Moving on, I gather that you say, parents of children who fail will, by law, have to be told they failed (which, in my experience, is the same as telling the children). Perhaps you could prepare the speech that a headteacher could give to the year 1 children: \"Hello children, all of you, sitting over there are failures. It's about two thirds of you.\" What a good way to encourage them to become eager learners! Now here's the next rumour bit \u2013 people are saying that this is all a cunning plan so that you can run a big press conference in the summer announcing that we have a nation of illiterates and the present one-hour a day synthetic phonics lessons should be upped to two hours. There are even some cynical people (tush \u2014 who would have thought there could be such people!), who are saying that you'll run the pass level at 34 out of 40 for the time being, and then after a year or so of SP, you'll lower it a bit, more children will pass, and, hey presto, you've improved reading! How can people think such things of you? Shocking. And then, as if all this wasn't enough, you'll never guess what I heard this week? Someone told me that when you ran a press conference to tell the group of lucky journalists assembled there that the free school experiment in Sweden was a success, one journalist asked you if you were aware of the evidence emerging from Sweden that things weren't going quite as swimmingly as you suggested. Whereupon, you asked him if he was aware of the counter-evidence: a master-stroke of repartee, sir, if I may say so. But I cannot find the counter-evidence you mention anywhere, and dare I say I am a bit worried about that. It slightly reminds me of your party conference speech that time when you compared the questions on science exam papers in the US and Britain, while failing to point out that the paper in the US was a chemistry exam for students aged 16 to 19 and the UK one was for GSCE biology. In a test on use of evidence, that would have had me telling your parents you were a failure, you know. But these are all rumours and we really need to dump them in the bin marked \"false\" as soon as possible, don't we? Michael Rosen's letters appear monthly",

      "bodyText": "Government attempts to save \u00a3350m by limiting the availability of legal aid have suffered a succession of defeats in the House of Lords. The justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, was watching as peers rejected, by a majority of 37, his proposals to restrict legal support for victims of domestic violence. Earlier peers voted, by a majority of 45, to ensure there should be \"access to legal services that effectively meet [people's] needs\", albeit within the context of the resources available. There has been fierce opposition within the Lords to the Ministry of Justice's proposals during weeks of debate in the committee stage of the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders bill. Ministers had hoped the unease would not translate into parliamentary defeats. The bill now seems destined to endure the same difficult passage through the upper chamber endured by the proposed changes to health and welfare. The defeats raise the prospect of the government having to reverse the Lords' decisions in the Commons, using the argument that it is primarily a financial measure. Such a move would add to the constitutional debate over the role and powers of the House of Lords. Lord Pannick, who put forward the access to legal services amendment at the start of the report stage of the bill, said his move would not cost the government anything since the duty would only apply \"within the resources made available\". The Labour QC Lady Mallalieu said the amendment was crucial because it would show the government was \"not abandoning what is an essential pillar of our constitution, which is that nobody should be denied the right to go to a court of law because they can't afford it\". Under the MoJ's restrictive criteria for providing legal support someone who has made use of a women's refuge would no longer have been able to use that experience as evidence of domestic abuse. Nor would police attendance at a domestic violence incident or medical records have been deemed sufficient proof of eligibility for legal aid. On a third amendment, requiring the director of legal aid casework to be independent, the government lost by 17 votes. Welcoming the decision, the Law Society, which represents solicitors, said: \"The debate had highlighted a serious contradiction at the heart of the [director's] role, between his duty to be independent in making decisions on individual cases, and his responsibilities to his minister.\" The defeat on the government's narrower criteria for assessing whether victims of domestic violence should receive legal help is a significant rejection of government plans. The former attorney general, Lady Scotland, warned that government changes \"risk turning the clock back by at least a decade and placing a number of victims at unacceptable risk\". She demanded that the \"evidential criteria\" required to prove that domestic violence had occurred protected all victims of domestic violence and hit out at \"arbitrary time limits\" being imposed on evidence supporting an application for legal services. \"In the UK two women every week die as a result of domestic violence. And every week 230 victims need help to leave their abusive relationship,\" said Scotland. She warned: \"The provisions in this bill, if accepted, will cause great damage. We know from a recent survey that 54.4% of victims today would not get through the evidential gateway created by this bill. A great injustice may be allowed thereby to enter into our system.\" The government was defeated by 238 votes to 201, a majority 37. The vote came after McNally insisted that the move was unnecessary and defended the government's record on domestic violence. He told peers: \"This government is absolutely committed to supporting action against domestic violence and supporting the victims of domestic violence whether through legal aid funding or other means.\" Sadiq Khan MP, Labour's shadow justice secretary, said: \"The House of Lords have acted today to ensure that victims of domestic abuse are given the legal protection, rights and access to justice they need to escape abusive relationships. \"The government has shown itself out of touch throughout the progress of the bill, refusing to listen to the Women's Institute, Rights of Women and the victims of abuse. The Tory-led government have proven themselves to be out of touch with the needs of women in the criminal justice system on a number of occasions and they need to accept this vote and get on with the important work of actually protecting victims from abusers.\" Des Hudson, chief executive of the Law Society, which represents solicitors, said: \"It seems to me that any sensible government would want to look long and hard about how it responds to these votes. There's a consistent pattern of drubbings. So many people have put forward alternatives for saving money without doing the damage this bill will inflict on justice.\" During the debate, Lord Beecham said of the justice secretary, Ken Clarke: \"[He] hails from Nottingham and displays the same robust attitude to justice of that City's legendary sheriff.\" Helen O'Brien, chief executive of the Catholic Church's Caritas Social Action Network said: \"We are pleased that the House of Lords recognised that vast numbers of women, men and children were at great risk if this bill was passed unamended. The acceptance of a wider range of evidence will allow a greater number of victims to escape abuse and provide safer and more stable environments for the three quarters of a million children affected by domestic abuse. We call for the government to accept these amendments when the bill returns to the Commons.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012 as it incorrectly stated that Lady Scotland was the shadow attorney general.",

So many people have put forward alternatives for saving money without doing the damage this bill will inflict on justice.\"</p> <p>During the debate, Lord Beecham said of the justice secretary, Ken Clarke: \"[He] hails from Nottingham and displays the same robust attitude to justice of that City's legendary sheriff.\"</p> <p>Helen O'Brien, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.caritas-socialaction.org.uk/\">Catholic Church's Caritas Social Action Network</a> said: \"We are pleased that the House of Lords recognised that vast numbers of women, men and children were at great risk if this bill was passed unamended. The acceptance of a wider range of evidence will allow a greater number of victims to escape abuse and provide safer and more stable environments for the three quarters of a million children affected by domestic abuse. We call for the government to accept these amendments when the bill returns to the Commons.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012 as it incorrectly stated that Lady Scotland was the shadow attorney general.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Residents caught up in Britain's most severe case of mass poisoning received the \"worst possible advice\" in the aftermath of the disaster, an inquest has heard. People living in Camelford, Cornwall, were given \"terrible\" advice about what to do after their water supply was contaminated with aluminium sulphate, including to boil water, which would have increased the concentration, it was claimed. The remarks came at the resumption of a long-running inquest into the death of a former Camelford resident, Carole Cross, from a rare brain disease 16 years after the poisoning. Scientist Chris Exley said Cross's brain contained a greater amount of aluminium than any he had examined during his career. \"The amount of aluminium in her brain is of an order rarely seen and only seen previously in cases of aluminium toxicity,\" he said. Exley said he had studied samples of more than 100 brains and Cross \"has the record\" in terms of amounts of the metal. Cross was living in north Cornwall in July 1988 when the water supply serving Camelford and the surrounding area was contaminated with 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate, which was accidentally dumped into the wrong tank. The inquest has heard that residents were advised to boil their water. Exley, a professor of bioinorganic chemistry at Keele University, told the inquest: \"The advice given at the time was the worst possible advice to give. Boiling the water would have tripled the concentration of aluminium. It was absolutely terrible advice. I don't think anyone was given any good advice, it is utterly beyond belief and it cannot be acceptable.\" Twenty thousand customers may have been affected. After the incident, some of those who drank or bathed in the contaminated water reported health problems including stomach cramps, skin rashes, diarrhoea, mouth ulcers and aching joints. Some campaigners say people have suffered long-term health effects because of the poisoning and allege there was a cover-up because the water authority was about to be privatised. Cross died at Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton in 2004, aged 59, after suffering from a rare form of neurological disease cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), usually associated with Alzheimer's. Exley described the amount of aluminium sulphate poured into the water as \"catastrophic\" but said there was not enough evidence to show the aluminium in Cross's brain came from the accident because \"inadequate\" testing had been done at the time. The inquest started in November 2010 and heard how the South West Water Authority did not tell the public for three weeks the cause of the poisoning. Customers flooded the authority's switchboard with calls but were told the water was safe to drink. A report into Cross's death by two experts in neuropathology has previously concluded there was \"very real possibility\" that her death was caused by high levels of aluminium. The report, presented to the inquest, stated: \"In the absence of any evidence of the genetic cause of Alzheimer's there was the very real possibility that her death was caused by aluminium. It was particularly unusual to occur at such an unusually young age.\" However, James Nicholl, a neuropathologist at the University of Southampton, urged caution, telling the inquest a definite link between the contamination and the brain disease could not be proved without analysing the brains of other people in Camelford. He added: \"If half a dozen cases of this were identified in the Camelford population it would very much strengthen the idea that it was due to the water contamination episode.\" The inquest in Taunton continues.",

It was a thrilling, nuanced experience with moments of euphoria and depression, extreme fatigue and incredible energy. Whoever won, I have come away from the elections better off. Polling station no 2418 is in a school building in Yasenevo, on the south-western outskirts of the Russian capital. It's exactly like hundreds of other schools scattered around Moscow: a three-storey tetragonal affair with a courtyard. I had classes in the one right next to it when I was a kid. The election officers there consisted, as usual, of a bunch of stressed-out teachers. For the first time, though, there were a number of determined and experienced independent monitors among them, people who were elected not just to be observers, but were members of the Local Elections Commission itself. This is something quite unprecedented in Russia's electoral history. Voting in my station turned out to be as clean as could be: we failed to record a single violation. Other commission members were polite, helpful and understanding. There were depressing moments \u2013 I went to accompany a polling team to bring the box to immobile voters and saw frail, elderly people living in squalor, misery and loneliness. But there were small victories. One particularly diligent monitor helped eject a suspected agent provocateur pretending to be an \"international observer\", and there were cries of relief among both commission members and monitors when all the numbers added up neatly. I am well aware that there are many instances of highly questionable voting that demand an investigation, but what I saw made me question the pessimistic comments about this election being the \"final nail into the coffin of Russian democracy\". It has taken just three months since the Duma elections for thousands of people, most of whom were completely apolitical, to become experts in electoral law, train other people and organise a co-ordinated effort to monitor the elections. There were iPhone apps to promptly register violations and upload the data into a centralised database, mobile teams to chase and photograph buses carrying \"carousel\" voters, hotlines to call and soup kitchens to provide sustenance. People who had never met before recognised each other as colleagues and in a few intense hours became friends. What is clear to me is that if so many people are prepared to invest so much time, effort and resources, to sacrifice a whole weekend (with weeks of preparation) to a common cause, then Russia has indeed changed, even if the election results were disappointing to so many. The contrast between the depressed apathy of 2008 and now couldn't be more striking. If it takes a Putin to trigger that kind of grassroots initiative, then he deserves at least some credit. \u2022 Having filed this story, I went to Pushkinskaya Square in central Moscow where I witnessed an unnecessary violent dispersion of a peaceful and legal protest against electoral fraud. This unfortunate reminder of modern Russia's darker side blew a large hole in my newly-found optimism, but it would be too naive to assume that leaders addicted to intimidation can reform overnight.

      "bodyText": "It's a Saturday morning on the sixth floor of the HSBC building in London's Canary Wharf, and a group of about 90 schoolchildren are milling expectantly around the reception area. Despite the location, this isn't an open day for a career in banking. These 15- and 16-year-olds are all candidates for the London Academy of Excellence (LAE) \u2013 the first sixth-form college to start up under Michael Gove's free school programme. \"Today is the last of our four assessment days,\" explains project co-ordinator Simon Smith. \"Every candidate will sit a verbal reasoning test and have a formal interview.\" The LAE is set to open in Newham \u2013 one of London's most deprived boroughs \u2013 this September. It is backed by a group of eight independent schools including Eton and Brighton college, which is leading the proposal. HSBC is providing initial funding. \"We're aiming to take at least half our students from Newham, and the rest from surrounding boroughs,\" says Smith. \"We are selective \u2013 we expect candidates to have at least five B-grades at GCSE \u2013 but we'll also be taking into account their tests today and how they do at interview.\" \"There aren't enough places in the borough to meet the demand for an academic sixth form,\" says Brighton college's headteacher, Richard Cairns, who came up with the idea. \"All we're doing is providing choice.\" Newham already has two sixth-form colleges and two schools that have a sixth form. They were all rated \"good\" or \"outstanding\" in their most recent Ofsted reports. The new college has no track record of its own and no facilities. Until a few weeks ago, it didn't even have a building to teach in. Yet it says it's had 500 applicants for a first year of 150 places. So what's the appeal? What is the new school offering that local authority schools aren't? \"The Eton connection does attract me,\" says Davina Rana, 16, one of today's candidates. \"Eton is known as a school with high achievers. In east London it's constantly drilled into us that we are the least successful and don't get anywhere. \"With this school, what you are financially is not a problem. It's a bit like a scholarship. I think I'll get more chance of a place at university here.\" The school's website certainly focuses on offering a route to a \"top\" university \u2013 specifically one of the Russell Group, which includes Oxford, Cambridge, and the London School of Economics. It aims to do this by offering only what it calls \"12 key subjects\". These include maths, English and history, but not courses such as communications studies or psychology. Some people might find that approach restrictive, but 15-year-old Chloe Bowden, another of today's candidates, disagrees. \"I really want to go to university, and I have focused on the Russell Group,\" she says. \"[The school's website] says hard work and aspiration equals a place at university. I think they've selected the 12 subjects most suited to helping you get a place.\" Chloe's mother does have some doubts about an untried school. \"It's a risk,\" she says. \"In two years I might be saying it's a risk we shouldn't have taken. But this is the first year, so they've really got to prove themselves. \"In the borough we live in, there's nothing really suitable for Chloe,\" she says. \"They've been building lots of flats recently, but no schools. I'm not against state schools, but free schools are stepping in to help bridge that gap. From what I've heard, they do provide more flexibility and opportunity for the parents and pupils.\" The London Academy of Excellence, which will be housed in former council offices for Newham children's services, is drawing on the staff of its partner schools. Highgate is looking after maths. Eton will supply an English teacher. Forest school in Snaresbrook will help to mentor students towards a university place. Valeria Leonteva, 15, is attracted by the promise of smaller classes. \"Other schools I've been looking at are generally very big \u2013 2,000 in the sixth form. This one has 150 people in every year. I'm expecting 15 in a class as opposed to 25, in a local authority school. They're also having a dress code. I think that's more likely to encourage good behaviour.\" \"Of course there's a behaviour policy,\" says school's headteacher, Robert Wilne, who was, until recently, head of maths at the independent Highgate school. \"But I want to create an atmosphere of respect and self-discipline rather than a framework of rules.\" One parent of one of today's candidates, who didn't want to be named, isn't too sure about the school's approach. \"I don't know whether the discipline model would suit some of the kids,\" he says. \"Some of them haven't been used to that kind of structure. I'm worried that the battle to maintain it might cause distractions, especially due to peer pressure. \"School uniforms can attract unwanted attention. [Newham] is a high crime, high gang area. I've got some fears that the model might sound great in theory but present problems in practice.\" \"I think that underestimates young people,\" says Wilne. \"It's terribly unfair to assume that young people can't be self-disciplined.\" Wariss Tamim, 15, has mixed feelings. \"I like their optimistic vibe,\" he says. \"I think it's an attractive gamble to take. The teacher-student percentage is low, and the teachers [here today] seem friendly. But it is the first year, you can't be sure that it will be a success. My heart is saying yes 100%, but my head is saying that it might fail.\"",

These 15- and 16-year-olds are all candidates for the London Academy of Excellence (LAE) \u2013 the first sixth-form college to start up under Michael Gove's free school programme.</p> <p>\"Today is the last of our four assessment days,\" explains project co-ordinator Simon Smith. \"Every candidate will sit a verbal reasoning test and have a formal interview.\"</p> <p>The LAE is set to open in Newham \u2013 one of London's most deprived boroughs \u2013 this September. It is backed by a group of eight independent schools including Eton and Brighton college, which is leading the proposal. HSBC is providing initial funding.</p> <p>\"We're aiming to take at least half our students from Newham, and the rest from surrounding boroughs,\" says Smith. \"We are selective \u2013 we expect candidates to have at least five B-grades at GCSE \u2013 but we'll also be taking into account their tests today and how they do at interview.\"</p> <p>\"There aren't enough places in the borough to meet the demand for an academic sixth form,\" says Brighton college's headteacher, Richard Cairns, who came up with the idea. \"All we're doing is providing choice.\"</p> <p>Newham already has two sixth-form colleges and two schools that have a sixth form. They were all rated \"good\" or \"outstanding\" in their most recent Ofsted reports. The new college has no track record of its own and no facilities. Until a few weeks ago, it didn't even have a building to teach in. Yet it says it's had 500 applicants for a first year of 150 places. So what's the appeal? What is the new school offering that local authority schools aren't?</p> <p>\"The Eton connection does attract me,\" says Davina Rana, 16, one of today's candidates. \"Eton is known as a school with high achievers. In east London it's constantly drilled into us that we are the least successful and don't get anywhere.</p> <p>\"With this school, what you are financially is not a problem. It's a bit like a scholarship. I think I'll get more chance of a place at university here.\"</p> <p>The school's website certainly focuses on offering a route to a \"top\" university \u2013 specifically one of the Russell Group, which includes Oxford, Cambridge, and the London School of Economics.</p> <p>It aims to do this by offering only what it calls \"12 key subjects\". These include maths, English and history, but not courses such as communications studies or psychology. Some people might find that approach restrictive, but 15-year-old Chloe Bowden, another of today's candidates, disagrees. \"I really want to go to university, and I have focused on the Russell Group,\" she says. \"[The school's website] says hard work and aspiration equals a place at university. I think they've selected the 12 subjects most suited to helping you get a place.\"</p> <p>Chloe's mother does have some doubts about an untried school. \"It's a risk,\" she says. \"In two years I might be saying it's a risk we shouldn't have taken. But this is the first year, so they've really got to prove themselves.</p> <p>\"In the borough we live in, there's nothing really suitable for Chloe,\" she says. \"They've been building lots of flats recently, but no schools. I'm not against state schools, but free schools are stepping in to help bridge that gap. From what I've heard, they do provide more flexibility and opportunity for the parents and pupils.\"</p> <p>The London Academy of Excellence, which will be housed in former council offices for Newham children's services, is drawing on the staff of its partner schools. Highgate is looking after maths. Eton will supply an English teacher. Forest school in Snaresbrook will help to mentor students towards a university place.</p> <p>Valeria Leonteva, 15, is attracted by the promise of smaller classes. \"Other schools I've been looking at are generally very big \u2013 2,000 in the sixth form. This one has 150 people in every year. I'm expecting 15 in a class as opposed to 25, in a local authority school. They're also having a dress code. I think that's more likely to encourage good behaviour.\"</p> <p>\"Of course there's a behaviour policy,\" says school's headteacher, Robert Wilne, who was, until recently, head of maths at the independent Highgate school. \"But I want to create an atmosphere of respect and self-discipline rather than a framework of rules.\"</p> <p>One parent of one of today's candidates, who didn't want to be named, isn't too sure about the school's approach. \"I don't know whether the discipline model would suit some of the kids,\" he says. \"Some of them haven't been used to that kind of structure. I'm worried that the battle to maintain it might cause distractions, especially due to peer pressure.</p> <p>\"School uniforms can attract unwanted attention. [Newham] is a high crime, high gang area. I've got some fears that the model might sound great in theory but present problems in practice.\"</p> <p>\"I think that underestimates young people,\" says Wilne. \"It's terribly unfair to assume that young people can't be self-disciplined.\"</p> <p>Wariss Tamim, 15, has mixed feelings. \"I like their optimistic vibe,\" he says. \"I&#xa0;think it's an attractive gamble to take. The teacher-student percentage is low, and the teachers [here today] seem friendly. But it is the first year, you can't be sure that it will be a success. My heart is saying yes 100%, but my head is saying that it might fail.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the first half of the 20th century, architecture featured as an Olympic event. Medals in the \"culture games\" were also awarded for sports-related endeavours in the fields of music, painting, literature and even town-planning. But the practice was abandoned after the 1948 games, when the last gold medals for architecture went to an Austrian ski-jump and an athletics centre in Finland. Architecture now has plenty of other awards to make up for the loss, including the Royal Institute of British Architects' own gold medal. But when it comes to London 2012 buildings, the podium places seem to have been decided already. Three major venues have dominated public and media attention, just as they dominate the site: the main Olympic Stadium, the Aquatics Centre, and the Velodrome. Rightly so, you could argue: these are the principal venues, and the latter two are impressive works by two top British practices, Zaha Hadid and Hopkins Architects respectively. But now that most of the building work is done, it's clear that the other Olympic buildings are more than just a field of also-rans. In terms of show-stopping design, London's Olympics have never threatened to compete with their expensive predecessor, Beijing 2008. There's the economic climate to consider \u2013 and the fact that London already has plenty of perfectly good sports venues. Instead, London 2012's organisers have taken their cue from Barcelona's 1992 games, using the Olympics to make lasting improvements to the city. (If there's one word you rapidly tire of hearing in London 2012 design circles, it's \"legacy\".) The result is a different type of Olympic landscape, one made up of permanent buildings designed with the future in mind (some of which have nothing to do with sport), alongside temporary structures that point to a more efficient way of hosting major sports events in the future. Some of this is plain and pragmatic (the Olympic Stadium), some of it is plain hideous (the ArcelorMittal Orbit), but much of it, in a quiet, practical, sleeves-rolled-up sort of way, is architecture Britain should be proud of. It's not about winning; it's about the taking part. Nor is this a sprint: it's a marathon. Here are some of the highlights so far. Shooting galleries and basketball arena Magma and Wilkinson Eyre Cost: \u00a332m and \u00a341m respectively Two temporary, reusable venues eyeing a sustainable future for large sports events. The chief of the Rio 2016 Olympics has already expressed an interest in taking the basketball arena to Brazil, while the shooting venues might well reappear at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Both are simple tent-like structures made from a kit of parts, but given a distinctive twist. The 12,000-seat basketball arena's membrane is stretched over a random arrangement of curved forms. Inside, in accordance with sporting regulations, it is essentially a black box \u2013 albeit one with 8ft-high doorways so tall players don't bump their heads. Over in Woolwich, the three shooting venues (different sizes for the variety of Olympic disciplines), are a safe distance from the famous facades of the Royal Artillery Barracks \u2013 which is just as well since they look more like rave tents at a festival, studded with coloured circular projections resembling the suckers of octopus tentacles. As well as creating a distinctive \"family\" identity, the suckers serve as ventilation openings, and become round doorways at ground-level. If they were Olympians they would be: Kenyan marathon runners. They look like a bunch of lightweights but should get results. Handball arena Make Cost: \u00a341m The quintessential London 2012 project: nothing fancy, does the job, but just enough character to earn it a nickname \u2013 the Copper Box. Apart from the copper, it looks like the generic sports centre it is destined to become post-Games, and its red trim does look slightly 1980s. But the unassuming design is energy-efficient, flexible and highly practical. There's a public level to the 6,500-seat arena halfway up, marked by a strip of glazing running around the building. That means you can walk straight into the action, or just peer in and see what's going on as you walk past. Unsung features include a rainwater harvesting system, retractable seating and 88 \"light pipes\" in the roof that reduce lighting bills by 40%. Construction dust from the site went into the concrete, and even the copper is mostly recycled. If it was an Olympian: heptathlete Jessica Ennis. Modern, versatile and expected to deliver in the future. Central Park bridges Heneghan Peng Architects Cost: \u00a356m There are over 30 bridges around the Olympic site, old and new, but this is the special one. It's really three bridges in a Z-shape, which cross the River Lea in two wide, parallel 30-metre spans linked to each other by a narrower diagonal bridge. During the games this will be the main pedestrian route, so the gaps between the bridges have been filled in with a temporary rubber surface that looks like a giant psychedelic playmat. When this is removed, the bridge will link not just the two sides of the river but the two levels of the Olympic Park: the upper concourse and the rivers, canals and wetlands below. The bridge looks even better from beneath: its undersides resemble the keels of a catamaran; clad in mirrored stainless steel, they create surprising reflections of the water. If it was an Olympian: Nadia Comaneci. Graceful, limber and dynamic, but doesn't look as if it's trying too hard. Old Ford water treatment centre and Pudding Mill pumping station John Lyall Architects Cost: \u00a37m and \u00a37.5m respectively The treatment centre performs the unenviable but alchemical feat of turning sewage into fresh water \u2013 a decent analogy for what the architects have done with this, the short straw of Olympic commissions. Typically, these buildings are dull corrugated metal sheds, but this one \u2013 providing non-drinking water for the whole site \u2013 camouflages its bulky sheds and tanks with timber cladding and gabion walls (a recurring theme across the site). And plenty of greenery \u2013 the Old Ford site will be a nature reserve when it's finished. Particularly appealing is a Luis Barragan-like cluster of cubes of rusted steel plates concealing the pumps for the aquifer below. At the other end of the site, Lyall has found unlikely romance in the unpromisingly named foul-water pumping station. Its concrete drum is enhanced by a chimney with a light box on top; imprinted into the walls are drawings of pumps and pistons from Joseph Bazalgette's celebrated Victorian sewer system, which runs nearby. It's a reminder of the last time such infrastructure was taken seriously. If it was an Olympian: the British sprint relay team. Good-looking individual parts that can get great results when they work together. But if one of them messes up, we're all in the, er \u2026 Olympic energy centres John McAslan &amp; Partners Cost: undisclosed Another building that looks as if it has work to do \u2013 and it has. This supplies all the electricity, heating and cooling for the site, and it wears its utilitarianism proudly. In form, the Energy Centre's industrial aesthetic alludes to Giles Gilbert Scott's Battersea and Millbank power station designs. But it's a smaller, lighter, cleaner interpretation, reflecting the 21st-century technology within. Rather than heavy brick, it is clad in perforated panels of rusted Cor-ten steel over a protective cloak of black rubber. The bright red external staircase and large bay window soften the severity. Inside, and in the adjacent, reconditioned warehouse building, are energy-efficient gas and woodchip-burning boilers, chillers and gas-fired turbines \u2013 all of which can be easily removed and upgraded in the future. If it was an Olympian: shot putter-turned-strongman Geoff Capes. Not pretty but lots of personality, and an endless capacity for heavy lifting. McDonald's AEW &amp; Philippe Avanzi Cost: undisclosed Not a brand you immediately associate with sporting physique, or world-class design, but they are sponsoring the Games, so tough. During its brief existence, this temporary burger joint will be the world's largest and busiest McDonald's, so it's good to see they've made an effort. The interior conforms to Philippe Avanzi's \"latest European design elements\" for the brand, which means more wood, bright graphics and decent furniture \u2013 most of which will be reused elsewhere after the games. The building's facades are screened by horizontal and vertical wooden slats, which create balconies and billboards and mask the basic two-storey cabin beneath. The design was influenced by treehouses and the transparency of Japanese architecture, say McDonald's \u2013 neither of which have much to do with London 2012. But it beats yellow and red plastic. If it was an Olympian: Ben Johnson. Like the disgraced sprinter, it doesn't really deserve to be in this company \u2013 but it very much looks the part. Electricity substation Nord Cost: undisclosed One of the most pleasing pieces of design on the site turns out to be one of the most mundane. You wouldn't mistake this for a sports building; there is nothing agile about it. Instead it is robust, earthbound and hard-wearing. Its ebony-black brick looks like it's ready for a lifetime of grime and graft, and it references the area's industrial past. But there's a considered subtlety here, too. The upper portions of the building are a permeable lattice of brickwork, letting in air to cool the transformers within; this gives a fine texture to the unapologetically massive forms. The flat roofs are also designed to aid colonisation by native plant species. What could have been a nondescript box is confident, dignified and sculptural. If it was an Olympian: Steve Redgrave. Strong, silent, enduring and monolithic \u2013 but still a team player. Eton Manor Stanton Williams Cost: around \u00a365m The original Eton Manor Boys Club was founded in 1907 by old Etonians to give underprivileged East End boys access to sports. That makes this one of the few places on site with a genuine sporting history \u2013 even if the club closed in 1967. This won't be a public venue during the Olympics, though it will host wheelchair tennis during the Paralympics; after the Games the building comes into its own as a home for the national hockey team and the Lawn Tennis Association. The main arena houses an indoor tennis court, and connects with a concrete outdoor seating stand for the main outdoor arena, with dozens more courts and pitches. Crisply detailed and well-ordered, using a small palette of materials (mainly timber, concrete and black metal), it makes a visual connection with the Velodrome next door; the two will form part of the same complex post-Games. If it was an Olympian: Sebastian Coe. Aristocratic, well-mannered and slightly aloof, but reserves of potential for when the Games are over.",

The upper portions of the building are a permeable lattice of brickwork, letting in air to cool the transformers within; this gives a fine texture to the unapologetically massive forms.

      "bodyText": "Spain is on a collision course with the European commission after Brussels fired a warning shot at the austerity wracked country for planning to overshoot its budget deficit targets. In an early test for the EU's new fiscal regime, the commission said Madrid was engaged \"in a serious deviation\" from previous pledges after Mariano Rajoy, Spain's new conservative prime minister, confirmed the government would fail to meet a budget deficit target this year of 4.4% of gross domestic product agreed earlier with Brussels. Rajoy has set a new target of 5.8% for this year after revealing that last year's deficit was 8.5%. The stand-off between the European authorities and Spain, a vulnerable party in the eurozone's debt crisis, came as Greece raced against the clock to sign up willing creditors for writing down half of its debt to private lenders. Athens has until Thursday evening to conclude a debt swap with its private creditors, reducing its obligations by \u20ac100bn as a central element in its new \u20ac130bn bailout accord with the eurozone. It remained unclear on Monday night whether some 90% of Greece's private creditors would volunteer for the deal by Thursday, casting uncertainty over the prospects for the bailout. But the International Institute of Finance, representing around half of the creditors, said its members would accept the terms, while Athens threatened to invoke legal clauses to force others to follow suit. \"Our target is near universal participation,\" Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek finance minister, said. \"Whoever thinks that they will hold out and be paid in full is mistaken,\" he told Reuters. With the fate of the Greek bailout hanging in the balance, but likely to go ahead, eurozone finance ministers are to hold talks on Friday once they have learned the participation rate in the \"haircuts\" being suffered by Greece's private creditors. While Greece's position should be clarified this week, other challenges to the EU's fiscal dilemmas are bubbling away, ready to erupt. In recession, wrestling with runaway unemployment rates that are the highest in Europe, and already embarked on huge spending cuts, the Spanish government appears to be up against a European commission keen to make full use of its new powers. The commission has already ordered Belgium to slash its spending and threatened to withhold hundreds of millions of euros in funds to Hungary unless Budapest sticks to its budgetary pledges, making it more difficult to show leniency towards Madrid. The Netherlands is also heading for a confrontation after its finance ministry warned that deficit reduction targets had gone awry. A report by the economic consultancy Lombard Street Research said the Dutch would be better off outside the euro after a decade of low growth. The report said the rising cost of supporting bankrupt European countries, which it put at between \u20ac1.3 trillion and \u20ac2.4tn by 2015, would force the Netherlands to accept much lower standards of living. Amadeu Altafaj, a spokesman for Ollie Rehn, the monetary affairs commissioner who under the new rules has the right to police national budgets, said: \"All member states should continue to respect their commitments according to the rules \u2026 They should meet agreed budgetary targets and stand ready to pursue further consolidation measures if needed. \"Let's shed all the light on what happened in Spain in 2011 because it's a serious deviation. We need to know the origin of this deviation, the nature of this deviation.\" But Rajoy is asserting national sovereignty over the new EU rules. At an EU summit on Friday when he signed up for the eurozone's binding new fiscal pact, Rajoy failed to let other EU leaders know of his budget revision. He bragged that it was none of their business. \"I'm not going to tell the other presidents or heads of state about the deficit figure that will be included in our budget,\" he said. \"I don't have to. It's a sovereign decision. I'll tell the (European) commission in April.\" The fiscal pact and new laws on \"economic governance\" enacted last year have been criticised as representing an assault on democratic choice in EU countries and as a restriction on sovereignty. The new rules have largely been written in Berlin, but even among Germany's allies in the euro crisis countries are bristling at the constraints on their freedom of manoeuvre. The Dutch, fiscal hawks strongly aligned with Germany throughout the crisis, are also at risk of breaking the rules. Faced with a deterioration in the public finances that could see the Netherlands also penalised for excessive deficits, the minority coalition government of Mark Rutte on Monday launched weeks of negotiations on spending cuts. The populist eurosceptic, Geert Wilders, who props up the government in parliament in return for policy concessions, called for a referendum on staying in the eurozone.",

On the floor are sheets of paper covered in bread arranged into sculptural shapes. This a rehearsal for A Tender Subject, a play/installation by artist and director Mark Storor created with gay male prisoners \u2013 a vulnerable, often invisible group who are rarely officially recognised. From 16 March, in a short run in a secret location, audiences will walk through an installation led by actors playing prison officers and, says Storor, experience moments of tenderness in the gay prisoners' harsh lives. Bread is important in jail, says Storor. \"Lots of men end up with loaves of Mothers Pride in their cells \u2013 the brand has the contract for prisons. It's currency, you can play games with it, it's comforting. We're making a giant bread prison cell which will be about trying to somehow protect yourself, to give yourself comfort, but of course it's futile.\" Three years in the making, A Tender Subject was commissioned by Artangel, famous for producing art outside galleries including Rachel Whiteread's House and Jeremy Deller's recreation of the Battle of Orgreave. Storor had worked with prisoners before on a project called Boychild. When Artangel asked him to make a work exploring utopia in places perceived as violent or difficult, that experience, with his own sexuality, inspired him to work with gay prisoners. However, says Rachel Anderson, head of interaction at Artangel: \"When we asked Wandsworth prison services 'Can we work with gay men?' in the first meeting they said 'There aren't any'.\" Most gay prisoners, she says, keep their sexuality quiet for fear of homophobic violence. \"An openly gay prisoner would be famous on the prison scene.\" Gradually, with the help of the support group Gays and Lesbians in the Prison Service (Galips), Anderson and Storor located gay prisoners who would participate. First the Galips rep in HMP Wandsworth issued a diversity questionnaire. Out of 460 replies (40% of the prison) 25 men identified as gay, which persuaded the governor the project was worthwhile. Workshops were also set up in two other prisons, Doncaster and Parc in Wales. Storor and Anderson worked for seven weeks in Doncaster for two days a week \u2013 one with prisoners and one with prison staff. \"It was a big statement from the prison service to show that they fully supported people being openly gay in prison,\" says Anderson. \"Working with prison officers was a way of letting people know about the project and getting to understand that it was non-threatening,\" says Storor. \"We did a radio interview which went out to the prisoners and put up posters. We didn't say 'Are you gay, do you want to come and do a workshop?', it said 'Are you against homophobia?'\u2009\" The sessions were emotional, reducing even hardened prison officers to tears. \"One member of the senior management team's family had broken up and he was looking at an image of one man lying down next to another,\" says Storor. \"He interpreted that as the moment you're trying to find answers from yourself \u2013 how it could have been different.\" Storor collated the stories into a work which will be performed by actors from the Only Connect theatre group, which works with former prisoners and young people regarded as at risk of offending. Most of the cast have been in prison, though none, to the knowledge of Storor and Anderson, are gay. Storor and Anderson are at pains to point out that A Tender Moment is about intimacy, not sex. \"When we said we wanted to work with gay men, people would tell us about rape,\" says Anderson. \"In prison, it can be accepted that men have sex with each other, but what can't be accepted is that men share the same moments of connection and tenderness in such an important way as a man and a woman do.\" Anderson believes that A Tender Subject is a \"pivotal work\" for Artangel which has wide-ranging implications for the arts in Britain. \"Its roots are in educational practice, it articulates itself through social value and through the value of those participating in the process but it stands in a mainstream arts framework.\" Though Storor's previous work includes For the Best, made with terminally ill children at the dialysis unit at the Evelina hospital school in Southwark, south London, he says that A Tender Subject was his most challenging project yet \u2013 not only in persuading the prison officers that it was worthwhile, but also in the work's nature, trying to find moments of intimacy in a world where violence and fear are far more common. Jacques Le Vene, national chair of Galips, said projects like this were important for both staff and inmates. \"Everyone was treated as having something to offer the project. You can take a prisoner who's quite withdrawn, and through work like this can prove they have skills, a story to tell and leave prison with a better view of life and not have to turn to offending again. The staff begin to see the person behind the prisoner, which doesn't happen enough.\"",

Most of the cast have been in prison, though none, to the knowledge of Storor and Anderson, are gay.</p> <p>Storor and Anderson are at pains to point out that A Tender Moment is about intimacy, not sex. \"When we said we wanted to work with gay men, people would tell us about rape,\" says Anderson.</p> <p>\"In prison, it can be accepted that men have sex with each other, but what can't be accepted is that men share the same moments of connection and tenderness in such an important way as a man and a woman do.\"</p> <p>Anderson believes that A Tender Subject is a \"pivotal work\" for Artangel which has wide-ranging implications for the arts in Britain.</p> <p>\"Its roots are in educational practice, it articulates itself through social value and through the value of those participating in the process but it stands in a mainstream arts framework.\"</p> <p>Though Storor's previous work includes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/nov/15/for-the-best-mark-storor-interview\" title=\"\">For the Best</a>, made with terminally ill children at the dialysis unit at the Evelina hospital school in Southwark, south London, he says that A Tender Subject was his most challenging project yet \u2013 not only in persuading the prison officers that it was worthwhile, but also in the work's nature, trying to find moments of intimacy in a world where violence and fear are far more common.</p> <p>Jacques Le Vene, national chair of Galips, said projects like this were important for both staff and inmates.</p> <p>\"Everyone was treated as having something to offer the project. You can take a prisoner who's quite withdrawn, and through work like this can prove they have skills, a story to tell and leave prison with a better view of life and not have to turn to offending again. The staff begin to see the person behind the prisoner, which doesn't happen enough.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is the week before \"demo day\" at StartX \u2013 a non-profit organisation in the heart of Silicon Valley that assists Stanford University students with their own startup businesses. Budding entrepreneurs are putting the finishing touches to their pitches. \"Do you want the 10-second, one-minute or 10-minute version?\" asks Pratik Verma, founder of AgeTak Inc, a company that solves healthcare database problems and which is among the 13 student businesses finishing the current programme. StartX \u2013 whose offices include a dedicated nap room and walls that can be used as whiteboards \u2013 is a business accelerator program run by Stanford Student Enterprises, the business arm of the student body, since 2010. Thanks to web giant AOL, which hosts StartX inside its US west-coast headquarters for a token rent, StartX provides a time-limited \"incubation space\". Those on its three-month boot camp also get advice and support \u2013 including mentoring by experienced business people \u2013 to help create fast-growing companies that can attract investors like those that got Google and Facebook started. It culminates in \"demo day\", where the startups pitch in front of more than 200 investors. And Stanford students love it. In the last academic year, about 340 student businesses applied \u2013 representing about 1,300 young entrepreneurs. Of the 32 that won a place, an impressive 27 went on to raise funding of typically between \u00a3300,000 and \u00a31m each, with individual investor contributions ranging from about \u00a330,000 to \u00a360,000. A growing number of British students also have \"Zuckerbergian\" ambitions and want to be chief executives of their own companies rather than starting on the bottom rung of someone else's. While data on the UK student startup scene is lacking, a 2010 National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship study showed on average 28 student and graduate startups created per university in 2009-10, up 27% on the previous year. The most recent Higher Education Funding Council for England figures report more than 2,350 businesses were started by recent or new graduates in the 2009-10 academic year, up 12% on the year before. The growth in student enterprise on both sides of the pond is driven by culture and hard economics. \"Entrepreneurship has become much cooler recently,\" says Cameron Teitelman, StartX's managing director, who oversees a team of 15 student volunteers administering the programme. \"There was The Social Network movie ...[and] banking has had such bad PR.\" In the UK, student enterprise \"is really starting to bloom now\", says William Goodwin, the University of Bristol's current \"graduate entrepreneur in residence\" who runs the Basecamp incubator programme for student businesses at the university. \"Obviously, the economic climate is helping,\" he adds. \"There are not a huge number of jobs out there so people are starting to make their own.\" A new wave of accelerators and incubators is springing up in the UK to help. Some UK universities are waking up to the fact that their customers \u2013 students \u2013 expect nothing less. Last week, Sir Tim Wilson in his review of business-university collaboration, said universities should facilitate opportunities for students to pursue entrepreneurial activities. Bristol's Basecamp, launched in 2009, is currently incubating 15 businesses. They range from a social media website called Konqr that runs competitions, to a company called Nimble Servers to assist online gaming, to businesses planning to sell lingerie and liquid-nitrogen-chilled ice-cream. Like StartX, it provides free office space on campus, along with mentors, strategic resources and support. But there is no competition process to get in, no time limit, and no pitching session at the end. Instead, loans are offered via a dedicated \u00a330,000 alumni fund and it connects student businesses seeking funding \u2013 four currently are \u2013 to investors. Goodwin, whose post is paid by the institution from knowledge-transfer funds, oversees a team of six student advisers. \"The university wants to provide what the students want,\" he says, \"[and by doing so] in 10-15 years they can hopefully recoup the money in alumni donations.\" London Metropolitan University, which introduced a student component \u2013 called the Hatchery \u2013 to its fully fledged incubator for London businesses in 2009, came to the same realisation. It has the bonus of being located near London's Shoreditch-based \"Silicon Roundabout\", an area home to many tech startups and investors. Another longer-running incubator for student businesses is the Hive at Nottingham Trent University, which has been going for more than a decade. Yet this ready supply of entrepreneurs may exceed the readiness of some UK institutions and investors to support them. Not all universities have figured out quite how they can help entrepreneurial students, says Bart Clarysse, who holds a chair in entrepreneurship at Imperial College's business school. Many universities are focused on spin-outs from academic research built on concrete intellectual property (IP), which generates revenue for the institution. Supporting student businesses requires a new and very different model. \"You have students, who have no IP ... so [the institutions] are struggling,\" he says. But, Clarysse adds, universities should support the movement because of the valuable educational experience it provides. It is \"even more valuable\" to some future employers than doing an MBA, he says. Some student enterprise societies \u2013 which have traditionally offered more theoretical than practical help \u2013 are also testing the water in providing their own incubator and accelerator programmes where universities don't have them. Oxford University's student enterprise society, Oxford Entrepreneurs, established the Oxford Entrepreneurs Incubation Centre in 2009 for Oxford student startups in space provided by the institution. Successes include Plink \u2013 a mobile app that recognises well-known artworks \u2013 which was Google's first ever UK acquisition. Warwick Entrepreneurs launched a virtual incubator for Warwick University student startups last year. LSE students also last year piloted a virtual LSE Student Business Incubator. It is great to see, says Hushpreet Dhaliwal, chief executive of the UK's National Association of College and University Entrepreneurs \u2013 a non-profit organisation that supports student enterprise societies which has just won government funding. But, she cautions, societies and universities need to work in partnership to achieve real success. Yet, to really grow, student startups need to raise funds from investors. And while that's easy in Silicon Valley, it's more challenging in the UK. For Husayn Kassai, president of Oxford Entrepreneurs, lack of investment is the \"number one difficulty\". UK investors have the money, he explains, but they are geared up to spend very large sums to produce very large returns on investment, meaning small student businesses are overlooked. What student businesses often need, he says, is a smaller amount, in the realm of \u00a320,000 rather than \u00a3100,000, which few deal in. Clarysse agrees. There is so-called venture capital and angel investment available in the UK, but it is not what most student startups really need. Rather, \"very particular\" to Silicon Valley, and one of the reasons startups can flourish so well there, is the much greater investment from \"super angels\" \u2013 which might fund many startups with very small pots of cash. It is more of these types of investor, along with perhaps a micro-financing system, that would really help to get student businesses going in the UK, he says. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2012.

      "bodyText": "The then commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir Paul Stephenson, dined with the former deputy editor of the News of the World hours after trying to persuade the Guardian to drop its investigation into phone hacking, it has emerged. The Leveson inquiry into press standards was told that Neil Wallis, who was by that time on the payroll of the Met as a public relations adviser, was an acquaintance of Stephenson. Wallis was later to be arrested for questioning in connection with the hacking scandal. The inquiry heard that Stephenson went on 10 December 2009 to see the Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger, after being briefed by Assistant Commissioner John Yates that there was no new hacking evidence to investigate. Many believed the hacking allegations were politically motivated, Stephenson said, though he acknowledged he would have behaved differently had he been properly briefed. After failing to dissuade Rusbridger, he went to dine with Wallis, Yates and the Met's public relations chief, Dick Fedorcio. The appointments diary recorded it as a private dinner, which Stephenson said was held \"at a pub/restaurant that I frequented socially\". The Guardian editor was unaware that Stephenson knew Wallis, that he was planning to dine with him or that the Met was employing him. Rusbridger wrote asking for an explanation as to why he had not been told when the commissioner had expressed his \"strong feeling\" at the meeting that the Guardian's reporting was \"over-egged and incorrect\". He never got a reply. Asked if he had been trying to persuade the Guardian to drop its coverage, Stephenson said: \"No, I don't think I was.\" But he agreed: \"There was very much a backcloth that this was about politics over substance.\" He said: \"I was being briefed that there was no good value in expending additional police resources\" on the matter. Stephenson, who conceded he had not read the original Guardian articles, told Leveson: \"I was only as good as the briefings I got.\" Diary entries disclosed a pattern of socialising with Wallis similar to the meals in expensive restaurants with two other senior officers, Yates and Andy Hayman. Between 2006 and 2010 Stephenson had eight meetings with Wallis, who was also at a Scotland Yard reception for Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor appointed as David Cameron's media adviser. Restaurants visited included Luciano in St James's Street, on 23 June 2009, a few days before the Guardian broke its story alleging a News of the World hacking cover-up at a senior level. Stephenson said he knew at the time that Wallis was a friend of Yates who went to football matches with him. Asked by Leveson whether he had not himself become a friend of Wallis, Stephenson said he regarded him more as a \"light acquaintance\". Stephenson said he had first been introduced to Wallis as a deputy commissioner fresh from Lancashire at a dinner with Fedorcio on 19 September 2006. This apparently cordial dinner took place despite a \"tense standoff\" between the News of the World and police, who had arrested Mulcaire and Goodman, and attempted to search the paper's premises on 8 August of that year. Police have told Leveson the paper's staff were completely unco-operative and officers had feared violence while inside the NoW offices. The inquiry has heard that four days before Stephenson's first Wallis encounter, on 15 September 2006, an as yet unnamed senior police officer briefed Rebekah Brooks, the then Sun editor, assuring her that police were not planning to pursue any other News of the World journalists.",

Asked by Leveson whether he had not himself become a friend of Wallis, Stephenson said he regarded him more as a \"light acquaintance\".</p> <p>Stephenson said he had first been introduced to Wallis as a deputy commissioner fresh from Lancashire at a dinner with Fedorcio on 19 September 2006.</p> <p>This apparently cordial dinner took place despite a \"tense standoff\" between the News of the World and police, who had arrested Mulcaire and Goodman, and attempted to search the paper's premises on 8 August of that year. Police have told Leveson the paper's staff were completely unco-operative and officers had feared violence while inside the NoW offices.</p> <p>The inquiry has heard that four days before Stephenson's first Wallis encounter, on 15 September 2006, an as yet unnamed senior police officer briefed Rebekah Brooks, the then Sun editor, assuring her that police were not planning to pursue any other News of the World journalists.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Paul McBride, who has died suddenly aged 48, was a QC of outstanding ability, acting in high-profile criminal cases. A ruthless courtroom performer, he successfully defended Gail Sheridan, the wife of the former MSP Tommy Sheridan, against charges of perjury in a case against the News of the World. He was a defence counsel in some of Scotland's more gruesome murder cases and specialised in regulatory crime, representing the families affected by the Stockline factory disaster and the Rosepark carehome fire. His celebrity within Scotland reached far beyond the courtroom; he was on as familiar terms with Glasgow's football, political and media fraternities as he was with its legal brethren. A highly sociable and engaging figure with a wide circle of friends, he had a great line in gossip and a taste for being at the centre of events. But his public profile, particularly as a sharp-witted champion of Celtic Football Club's off-field interests, also made him enemies. McBride was due to give evidence this week at the trial of two men alleged to have sent parcel bombs to him, the Celtic manger Neil Lennon and others last year. Improbably, McBride's quixotic career came close to taking him into a Conservative cabinet. In 2009, he renounced his lifelong support for Labour, denouncing Gordon Brown's administration as \"mendacious and incompetent\". He joined the Scottish Tories, who welcomed him for his \"brilliant legal and political mind\". This bright new arrival was immediately touted as a leading candidate for the role of advocate general for Scotland. The Tories' failure to gain an overall majority scuppered that option. The job went instead to Lord (Jim) Wallace, a Liberal Democrat. McBride then hoped to preside over a commission set up to investigate the unpopularity of the Scottish Tories and make recommendations for reform. However, this role went to the grandee Lord (Russell) Sanderson. In the absence of any obvious ideological attraction to the Conservatives, McBride's brief engagement with the party ended with his resignation in November 2011. The stalling of his political career coincided with a series of events in Scottish football that gave McBride the opportunity to espouse a cause with which he had a more obvious affinity, Celtic FC, which he had supported since childhood. During the 2010-11 season, he defended Lennon against charges of misconduct, and also became the chief tormentor of the Scottish Football Association, which he described as \"dishonest\", \"dysfunctional\" and \"biased\". Reciprocal threats of legal action never materialised. While there was nothing new in these opinions of Scottish football's ruling body, the frankness with which Scotland's most prominent QC enunciated them broke new ground and made him a hero with at least one half of Glasgow. McBride loved this role, which gave him a degree of public prominence that a career in Tory politics would scarcely have bestowed. His ubiquity as a media favourite, always ready with an opinion, expanded apace. The Scottish edition of the Sun on Sunday newspaper hired him as a columnist and, according to its editor, they were discussing the legal niceties of his second contribution on the eve of his death. McBride was an only child from a working-class background. He attended St Aloysius' college, the fee-paying Catholic school in Glasgow. From an early age, his eyes were fixed on a legal career and he left school at 16 to study for a law degree at Strathclyde University. He graduated when he was 19. Resisting all advice to proceed slowly, he was called to the Scottish bar at the age of 22 and when he took silk at 35, he was reputed to be the youngest ever QC in the UK. McBride said he had been told from all sides that he was \"too young, too inexperienced and had no contacts\". However, he had no doubts about his own abilities and made it his business to study in great detail the courtroom practitioners on whom he modelled himself. \"Luck and ability\" had carried him through, he said. Ever grateful to those who had taught him his courtroom arts, McBride also became a generous and devoted teacher to his young associates. His book, Criminal Appeals, written with Lord McCluskey, was published in 2000. In a comment that said much about his attitude to life, as well as to the law, McBride said: \"One of the most important things to remember is that people work with people and you are far more likely to keep getting instructions if you do the job well and are easy to be with. If you appear diffident, aloof or arrogant, you are unlikely to get a lot of repeat instructions.\" The absence of these characteristics served him well as both a public figure and a valued colleague and friend. McBride was found dead in his hotel room on a business trip to Pakistan. Police do not suspect foul play. He is survived by his parents and his partner, Gary Murphy. \u2022 Paul McBride, lawyer, born 13 November 1963; died 4 March 2012",

      "bodyText": "Ivan Glasenberg, the multi-billionaire chief executive of commodity trader Glencore, is to embark on a global investor road show with Xstrata boss Mick Davis in an effort to win over investors reluctant to back their $37bn (\u00a323bn) \"merger of equals\". News of the planned charm offensive came as Glencore announced its first set of full-year results as a public company, in which it gave no indication that it would sweeten its offer for the miner Xtrata. Glasenberg said: \"In April Mike [Davis] and myself will go on a road show to convince investors ... A lot of Xstrata shareholders are not shareholders of Glencore. A lot think Glencore has not got 'tier one' assets. We have got to educate them that Glencore has got tier one assets.\" The company, which released an estimate for 2011 profits last month, confirmed those results, with net income up 7% to $4.06bn and a 28% rise in revenues to $186bn. It will pay a total dividend for the year of 15 cents a share, which will mean that Glasenberg \u2013 who is the biggest shareholder with a 15% stake \u2013 will receive a dividend of $109m. The chief executive added that he had declined a potential bonus of \u00a31.8m, on the grounds that he receives the \"most benefit from the growth of the company\". Glencore is offering 2.8 new shares for every Xstrata share it does not already own \u2013 about two thirds of the company. Some analysts believe Glencore, the world's largest commodities trader, is likely to improve its offer in April, with Andrew Keen at HSBC saying 3.3 Glencore shares would be a fairer level. In April, documentation about the proposed tie-up will be sent to investors ahead of a vote in May. However, Glasenberg said the current offer was fair for all shareholders and insisted: \"It ain't a takeover, it's a merger of equals\". When asked why Glencore is offering a premium to Xstrata shareholders if the companies really are equal, he replied: \"Mike [Davis] is a hard negotiator\". He also pointed out that Xstrata executives will get most of the senior jobs. The latest efforts by Glasenberg to sell the Xstrata merger \u2013 a deal which was widely understood to be the reason the company floated last year \u2013 came as Zambia closed a copper treatment plant belonging to Glencore's Mopani Copper Mines for pollution violations. Glencore, which has previously been hit with a host of unwanted headlines involving Mopani over allegations that it has avoided paying \u00a3100m in local taxes, said in a statement it was surprised at the action by the environmental agency and implied it may be forced to lay off staff following the closure. \"The last visit by the Zambian Environmental Management Agency was in early February and the license was duly renewed on 21 February,\" a Glencore spokesman said. \"We are therefore surprised that we are currently required to suspend this project, which we believe may be due to recent unsubstantiated reports in the local press. We are working to resolve this situation as quickly as possible, not least because over 300 jobs depend on it. This project accounts for about 1.5% of Mopani's total production\". Glencore has always denied it owed any taxes to Zambia. Glasenberg, who did not rule out appearing in front of UK MPs conducting an enquiry on taxation in developing countries, insisted that Mopani taxes were no longer an issue in Zambia. Shares in Glencore edged down 0.1p yesterday to 403.45p. They floated at 530p just under a year ago.",

      "bodyText": "Women are subordinate to men, should not mix in work or education and must always have a male guardian when they travel, according to new guidelines from Afghanistan's top clerics which critics say are dangerously reminiscent of the Taliban era. The edicts appeared in a statement that also encouraged insurgents to join peace talks, fuelling fears that efforts to negotiate an end to a decade of war, now gathering pace after years of false starts and dead ends, will come at a high cost to women. \"There is a link with what is happening all over the country with peace talks and the restrictions they want to put on women's rights,\" said Afghan MP Fawzia Koofi, who warned that the new rules were a \"green light for Talibanisation\". The points agreed at a regular meeting of the Ulema Council of top clerics are not legally binding. But the statement detailing them was published by the president's office with no further comment, a move that has been taken as a tacit seal of approval. \"Ultimately, I don't see a way you can read it as not coming from (Hamid) Karzai,\" said Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch. \"It's probably not an extreme position for the Ulema Council, but it's an extreme position for Karzai, and not compatible with the constitution, or Afghanistan's obligations under international law.\" The clerics renounced the equality of men and women enshrined in the Afghan constitution, suggesting they consider the document that forms the basis of the Afghan state to be flawed from a religious perspective. \"Men are fundamental and women are secondary,\" the statement says, according to a translation by Afghan analyst Ahmad Shuja. \"Also, lineage is derived from the man. Therefore, the use of words and expressions that contradict the sacred verses must be strictly avoided.\" The statement drew criticism in parliament, where some politicians took it as a direct assault on the constitution and the wider government. If a ban on men and women working and studying together were implemented, it would in effect dissolve the legislature. \"The statement is against the constitution, against human rights and against women's rights,\" said Ahmad Shah Behzad, a member of parliament from western Herat province, who warned that Karzai risked being in dereliction of his duty to protect the constitution. The clerics also appeared to condone violence against women in some circumstances. \"Teasing, harassment and beating of women without a sharia-compliant reason, as set forth clearly in the Glorious Qur'an, is prohibited,\" the statement said, although it then called for punishment of those who assault women. There were some positive points in the list of women's rights given before the list of their obligations, Barr said. Most notably it denounces forced marriage and the practice of exchanging women to settle family disputes over money or honour. But overall, the statement marks a disturbing return to the language and ideology of the Taliban, said Nader Nadery, a former commissioner on Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission and an outspoken advocate for women's rights. \"It renews some of the restrictions that were imposed during their rule, and therefore it could be alarming should it influence government policies,\" Nadery said. In focusing on the status of women, the clerics are ignoring issues that worry ordinary Afghans more, Koofi added. \"The country has a lot of other priorities, and the religious scholars need to come forward and condemn those issues that people are concerned about, like suicide bombers or corruption.\"",

      "body": "<p>Women are subordinate to men, should not mix in work or education and must always have a male guardian when they travel, according to new guidelines from Afghanistan's top clerics which critics say are dangerously reminiscent of the Taliban era.</p> <p>The edicts appeared in a statement that also encouraged insurgents to join peace talks, fuelling fears that efforts to negotiate an end to a decade of war, now gathering pace after years of false starts and dead ends, will come at a high cost to women.</p> <p>\"There is a link with what is happening all over the country with peace talks and the restrictions they want to put on women's rights,\" said Afghan MP Fawzia Koofi, who warned that the new rules were a \"green light for Talibanisation\".</p> <p>The points agreed at a regular meeting of the Ulema Council of top clerics are not legally binding. But the statement detailing them was published by the president's office with no further comment, a move that has been taken as a tacit seal of approval.</p> <p>\"Ultimately, I don't see a way you can read it as not coming from (Hamid) Karzai,\" said Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch. \"It's probably not an extreme position for the Ulema Council, but it's an extreme position for Karzai, and not compatible with the constitution, or Afghanistan's obligations under international law.\"</p> <p>The clerics renounced the equality of men and women enshrined in the Afghan constitution, suggesting they consider the document that forms the basis of the Afghan state to be flawed from a religious perspective.</p> <p>\"Men are fundamental and women are secondary,\" the statement says, according to a translation by Afghan analyst Ahmad Shuja. \"Also, lineage is derived from the man. Therefore, the use of words and expressions that contradict the sacred verses must be strictly avoided.\"</p> <p>The statement drew criticism in parliament, where some politicians took it as a direct assault on the constitution and the wider government. If a ban on men and women working and studying together were implemented, it would in effect dissolve the legislature.</p> <p>\"The statement is against the constitution, against human rights and against women's rights,\" said Ahmad Shah Behzad, a member of parliament from western Herat province, who warned that Karzai risked being in dereliction of his duty to protect the constitution.</p> <p>The clerics also appeared to condone violence against women in some circumstances.</p> <p>\"Teasing, harassment and beating of women without a sharia-compliant reason, as set forth clearly in the Glorious Qur'an, is prohibited,\" the statement said, although it then called for punishment of those who assault women.</p> <p>There were some positive points in the list of women's rights given before the list of their obligations, Barr said. Most notably it denounces forced marriage and the practice of exchanging women to settle family disputes over money or honour.</p> <p>But overall, the statement marks a disturbing return to the language and ideology of the Taliban, said Nader Nadery, a former commissioner on Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission and an outspoken advocate for women's rights.</p> <p>\"It renews some of the restrictions that were imposed during their rule, and therefore it could be alarming should it influence government policies,\" Nadery said.</p> <p>In focusing on the status of women, the clerics are ignoring issues that worry ordinary Afghans more, Koofi added.</p> <p>\"The country has a lot of other priorities, and the religious scholars need to come forward and condemn those issues that people are concerned about, like suicide bombers or corruption.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mitt Romney is making inroads into Rick Santorum's stronghold in the south as the clock ticks down to Super Tuesday, according to a series of polls released on Sunday. The former Massachusetts governor trailed Santorum by double digits in Tennessee a week ago, but surveys released by three pollsters show Romney closing the gap to as little as four points. Romney, who separate polls show leading in the crucial state of Ohio, has mostly been campaigning in northern states, but paid a flying visit to a packed elementary school in Knoxville on Sunday evening. Public Policy Polling released data late on Sunday night that showed Romney with 29% of Republican voters in Tennessee, five points behind Santorum. Earlier in the day, a Rasmussen poll had Santorum at 34% with Romney on 30%, while an American Research Group survey showed Romney at 31% to Santorum's 35%. Newt Gingrich had 23% of the vote share in the PPP poll and 20% in ARG's study, with Ron Paul lagging behind. The figures represent a dramatic improvement in Romney's fortunes in Tennessee, a staunchly Republican state that will send 58 delegates to the party's convention in August. In a separate poll released last Wednesday by Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), Santorum commanded 40% of the vote in the Volunteer State, with Romney at just 19%. The poll was conducted before Romney won Arizona and Michigan on Tuesday, but shows how much ground Romney has made up since then. The MTSU poll director, Ken Blake, said although Santorum had secured the evangelical vote in Tennessee, that block only makes up around a third of Republican voters in the state. \"If you look among the rest of Tennessee Republicans, those who go to church less often or even not at all, they're about two-thirds of the Republican population in Tennessee,\" Blake said. \"Santorum and Romney run a lot closer in that population. Even though Santorum has the evangelical vote locked up in Tennessee, it's a much more fluid contest among the majority of Republicans. One way Romney could be closing this gap is by appealing to that two-thirds of Tennessee Republicans.\" Blake said that group was \"probably a pretty practical group of Republicans\". \"They may be most concerned with who can beat President Obama in the fall, and they may be picking up on the argument that Romney, being a bit more mainstream, is more electable at a national level than Santorum is.\" Blake added the upturn in fortunes in Tennessee reflected a wider trend towards Romney. \"If you look at the national polling, Santorum has been trending downward and Romney has been trending upward,\" he said. Romney narrowly won his home state of Michigan on Tuesday and triumphed convincingly in Arizona. A Rasmussen poll on Thursday showed Romney with a 16-point lead over Santorum nationwide. Romney made little mention of religion at a rally at West Hills Elementary School in Knoxville on Sunday, sticking to his core message of his track record in business and how that would translate to job creation and fiscal responsibility. The former Bain Capital chief attempted to connect with his Tennessee crowd by mentioning Davy Crockett, even reciting part of the Davy Crockett theme song, which drew a smattering of laughter from the crowd. Elizabeth Stephens, 72, echoed Blake's prediction that electability may be winning Romney voters in Tennessee. She said she had already voted for Romney, despite having been drawn to Santorum earlier in the campaign. \"I really liked him. But he can't beat Obama.\" Stephens, from Clinton, 10 miles north-west of Knoxville, said Romney's experience in business won her over. \"He's got the best ideas and he's going to turn this country around.\" Romney may not win Tennessee on Tuesday, but his improved polling figures in the south are encouraging with two southern states, Alabama and Mississippi, set to vote next week. \"If I were a betting man, I'd bet on Santorum to win [in Tennessee],\" Blake said. \"But I wouldn't bet my house. Romney has a good chance if he can appeal to the more secular majority among Tennessee's Republicans.\"",

      "bodyText": "It was a summit meeting between the world's most powerful media mogul and the man who is becoming arguably his favourite British politician. But one journalist on Monday suggested that Rupert Murdoch's meeting last week with Alex Salmond saw the News Corporation boss promise to move BSkyB's headquarters to Edinburgh if Scotland became independent and slashed corporation taxes. Andrew Neil, the former Sunday Times editor who now hosts the BBC's Sunday Politics, tweeted that the Scottish first minister gave him the impression that \"Rupert Murdoch dangled moving BSkyB to Edinburgh post-independence\". The journalist had interviewed Salmond for the programme which aired over the weekend, but said that the politician had made his comments after the cameras had stopped rolling. Neil later qualified his comment, saying that although there had been talks, there was no deal and he suspected Murdoch was winding up David Cameron. Murdoch met Salmond on Wednesday last week, at a Bute House meeting that was described by the Scottish government as \"focused on News Corporation's substantial economic footprint in Scotland\" in which the two men \"discussed the potential for further investment within the country\". The statement released at the time added: \"Mr Murdoch was keen to express his view that the current debate on Scotland's constitutional future continued to make Scotland an attractive place for inward investment.\" Over the weekend, another journalist and friend of Murdoch \u2013 former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie \u2013 also said that the official statement did not capture the full significance of the Scottish summit. Writing in the Daily Mail on Saturday, MacKenzie said: \"A little bird tells me Mr Murdoch suggested a referendum winner would be an announcement that corporation tax for firms coming to an independent Scotland would be cut from the UK norm of 26% to between 10% and 15%.\" MacKenzie added that if that occurred, Murdoch would act to relocate Sky in the Scottish capital. The media tycoon has been demonstrating a growing closeness to Salmond. A week ago, Murdoch's new title, the SNP-supporting Sun on Sunday, revealed what it claimed will be the date of the referendum on independence \u2013 18 October 2014. A few days prior to that Murdoch described \"Alex Salmond clearly most brilliant politician in UK\" on Twitter, in remarks that suggested that the media owner could be leaning towards independence for Scotland. Nevertheless, Murdoch's direct investment in Scotland is modest. News Corp's runs a printing plant in Motherwell \u2013 one of three UK print sites \u2013 and employs journalists on the Scottish Sun and the Scottish editions of the Times and Sunday Times, mostly based in Glasgow. The company also owns 39.1% of the highly profitable satellite broadcaster BSkyB, which employs 6,000 mainly call centre staff in Livingstone, Dunfermline and Uddingston. BSkyB did not comment on the speculation, but insiders said that the company had no plans to move its corporate headquarters to Edinburgh, not least because there was as yet no independent Scotland. Last year BSkyB \u2013 also the subject of a bid from News Corp that collapsed amid cross-party political hostility at Westminster at the height of the phone-hacking scandal in July \u2013 earned \u00a31.01bn in pre-tax profits and generated a tax charge of \u00a3256m. Its tax rate was 27%. Salmond's SNP has long wanted control of corporation tax, and his party has floated the idea of Irish-style cuts in the rate to attract investment from multinationals. But a spokesman for the first minister said that the speculation was exaggerated, forwarding a statement first released in response to MacKenzie's column in reply to Neil's remarks on Monday. The official statement said: \"The contents of the first minister's conversation with Rupert Murdoch was released to the media shortly after Wednesday's meeting, and it is clear that Mr MacKenzie's colourful account bears little resemblance to the discussions that actually took place.\" Murdoch's manoeuvres also suggest he has a greater control over the satellite broadcaster than he does. Although he was chairman, he stepped down from the board of BSkyB in December 2007, handing the position to his son James. Rupert Murdoch had been chairman of BSkyB since 1999. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "The morning had been spent dodging Muammar Gaddafi's security stooges and talking to activists planning the uprising that erupted days later. Driving from the centre of the city, we passed the sports centre where the dictator once ordered executions, before stopping beside the war cemetery. Under perfect blue skies, the tree-fringed cemetery was an oasis of sombre serenity after the bustle of Benghazi. I walked along perfectly kept lines of white headstones planted in the reddish soil, reading the details of men from all over the world who gave their lives in the fight against the Nazis. Alongside resolutely British names such as Bennett, Best and Bird there were airmen from Australia, sappers from South Africa and sepoys from India. Most graves featured Christian crosses, but mingled among the massed ranks of the dead was the Star of David for Jewish soldiers and crescents for Muslim troops. I stopped to look at the grave of Lieutenant-Colonel Geoffrey Keyes, whose headstone featured the unmistakable etching of a Victoria Cross, awarded for valour in leading a raid on General Rommel's headquarters at the age of 24. He may have been the son of an admiral of a fleet, but in death he was the equal of El Nur Gerad, a Sudanese private buried nearby. It was profoundly moving to see this stark reminder of so many young men killed in defence of freedom, especially coming on a trip to meet people so inspired by the same dreams of democracy and hopes of human rights that they were preparing to risk their own lives. So just over one year later, after thousands more people had died fighting to liberate Libya from despotism in a bloody struggle aided by our own armed forces, it was shocking to see that this commemorative spot had been devastated by religious bigots. Any decent person should despise the mob mentality that smashed scores of headstones in a two-day rampage in response to the idiotic burning of a Qur'an by US soldiers in Afghanistan. There can only be despair at the zealotry of extremists who tore down the elegiac Cross of Remembrance that stood over the cemetery. Many will fear that the desecration of such a special place \u2013 one that symbolised unity of different peoples and religions with such strength \u2013 is a sign that Libya is spiralling out of control and facing the threat of Islamist extremism. That is understandable after such an outrage. But it is also wrong. Without doubt, this is a depressing turn of events. It is a warning sign of the dangers ahead. But just as when neo-Nazi thugs desecrate Jewish cemeteries in Europe it does not mean the continent is on the brink of fascism, we should not read too much into the actions of a handful of misguided fools. Libya is a Muslim country, and most Libyans expect its new institutions will be founded on their faith just like ours were founded on Christian traditions. But they are predominantly moderate and tolerant; certainly, those I spoke to were disgusted by attacks that breach everything they believe in. There are other more serious causes for concern in Libya, such as the weakness of the transitional government, the killing and torture of Gaddafi loyalists, the mistreatment of sub-Saharan Africans and the heavily armed militias with regional loyalties that still pose a substantial threat to order. But while progress is slow and hesitant, the country is moving in the right direction. The rebel groups are mostly co-operating with the authorities. Oil revenues are starting to flow. A free press has sprung up, minutes of cabinet meetings are made public and elections are looming. We must remember this is a country recovering from 42 years of brutal, centralised and highly eccentric dictatorship, with everything from the security forces to state assets in the hands of one family. The road ahead is bound to be bumpy. The economy is struggling to recover from last year's conflict with mass unemployment, many state employees unpaid for a year and banks still restricting cash withdrawals. Amid this postwar chaos, Libyans unused to decision-making in the wake of despotism must find a way to rebuild their state and reimpose the rule of law. It was heartening to hear the transitional government denounce the destruction of the war graves, and its vow to find and prosecute the extremist perpetrators. It is vital it carries out its pledge, especially with the attack filmed and posted online. If it fails to do so, it dishonours all those who gave their lives for freedom \u2013 whether the young Libyans who overthrew Gaddafi last year or the young men from around the world who united to defeat the Nazis seven decades ago.",

      "bodyText": "In Trafalgar Square there is a big clock counting down the days, minutes and seconds until the opening of the Olympic Games. Three weeks of sporting highs (and lows), and it will all be over for another four years. There is another clock in every university counting down the days to the Research Excellence Framework (REF). There are still more than 600 left, although in the timescale of research it is already almost too late to affect the results. However, the consequences will still be felt when we enter the next Olympiad \u2013 and maybe the one after that. At the end of next year, universities will have to submit their entries for every subject in which they have any pretensions to undertake high-quality research. Between now and then, every academic will choose, or have chosen for them, their best research outputs. For every 10 members of staff an example of \"impact\" will have to be provided. The mayhem set off by the Browne report's recipe for privatisation in England 17 months ago, and aggravated by the botched white paper last summer, has tended to overshadow the UK-wide REF in the arena of high policy and public controversy \u2013 but not in many departments inside universities, where the REF is still the \"great game\". The stakes could hardly be higher. \"Top\" or \"world-class\" universities are defined first in terms of research, and only second in terms of their ability to attract the best students. The best students are attracted to the top research universities, not the other way round. For departments and research groups, not only their academic amour-propre is at stake. So, too, may be their academic sustainability, even survival. A poor REF score could start a haemorrhage of the best staff. For individual academics, at stake are their identities as scholars or scientists. REF grades are like bonuses at banks; not as cash payments, but as matters of existential life and death. The REF stakes are greater than ever because no one is yet sure how different the new system of measuring research performance will be from the five previous Research Assessment Exercises. A slightly retouched RAE, as most expect, or a Brave New World that rewards impact and engagement outside the academy? When the RAE began back in the 1980s, it had a galvanising effect. It weeded out those self-regarding academics whose great monograph always seemed to be just out of touch at the end of the rainbow. But each successive RAE tended to lose its intellectual bite, even though its financial consequences became more extreme. Results became more and more predictable. Game-playing took over. So the REF may re-galvanise research in universities. The outcomes are less predictable, which adds an element of excitement (and movement). The rules have changed just enough to make game-playing hazardous. The result could be a more open research system, with more dimensions of excellence. Of course, that was the whole point when Gordon Brown, as chancellor of the exchequer, announced that the RAE was going to be abolished and replaced by a new system that attempted to assess impact. Inevitably, his intention was watered down by a policy establishment that always prefers \"business as usual\", and a scientific establishment perfectly content with the existing \"winners\". But maybe (only maybe) enough remains to make the REF a game-changer. The emphasis on \"impact\" is a better fit with the real economy of research funding. Outside the humanities, researchers are increasingly dependent on project funding with built-in \"impact\". There is a flurry of new ideas \u2013 for example, of \"Mode 2\" knowledge that is shaped by applications, trans-disciplinary and \"socially distributed\". There is also renewed talk about the importance of \"translational\"' research that brings the users and producers of research together in creative alliances. The high priests of scholarship and science dismiss these ideas as newfangled heresies, and other forms of research as inferior and derivative \u2013 wrongly. Rightly they worry about the implications of all this for scientific freedom. In fact, these changes, weakly reflected in the REF, are an indication of the spreading success of research. It is reaching out not just to meet the R&amp;D needs of \"UK plc\" but also to support new social movements, cities and communities, and civil society at large. It is also knocking on the head the philistine idea that research and teaching are in chronic competition. So there is a lot more at stake in the REF than the fates of \"world-class\" universities, or the egos of \"top\" professors, or even the fortunes of hundreds of university departments, over the next decade. Also at stake, potentially, is an entirely new way of thinking about and doing research. Peter Scott is professor of higher education studies at the Institute of Education",

      "bodyText": "Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum made a final push on Monday in Ohio, the Super Tuesday state he must win to keep alive his challenge to favourite Mitt Romney. Ohio, where Santorum has been campaigning from morning to night, is effectively his last chance to stop Romney sweeping into a clear lead in the two-month long race. \"We are going to have a good day in Ohio tomorrow,\" Santorum told a crowd of a few hundred at a Christian school near Dayton. Super Tuesday is the biggest day of the Republican race so far, with 10 states at stake, but Ohio is the big prize. Romney, who is almost guaranteed to pick up four of Tuesday's contests \u2013 Virginia, Massachusetts, Vermont and Idaho \u2013 needs a victory in Ohio to show he can beat Santorum in the big, working-class swing states. In recent US history, Super Tuesday has often proved decisive, and Romney and the Republican establishment are hoping that it will be that way on Tuesday, ending a crazy race that over the last six months has seen candidates rise and fall with alarming regularity. Their fear is that the result ends up muddled, with Romney taking four states, Santorum pulling off an upset in Ohio and maybe adding Tennessee and Oklahoma, while Newt Gingrich takes Georgia. At the Dayton rally, Santorum portrayed Romney as a staid, establishment candidate. \"This race will be won by someone who can capture the imagination of the American people,\" he said. Romney, who Santorum claims is outspending him seven to one in advertising, could not win by money alone, he said. \"Where is the soul? Where is the fight,\" Santorum asked. Polls show Romney has the momentum going into the Ohio, having eliminated the lead Santorum enjoyed last week. Polls published on the eve of the primary have the two in a dead heat. A Suffolk poll shows Santorum at 37% to Romney's 33% but, and this could prove to be decisive, among early voters Santorum was leading 44% to 27%. A Quinnipiac University poll on Monday showed Romney on 34% in Ohio to Santorum's 31%. Last week, in the same poll Santorum was leading 36% to 29%. Professor Michael McDonald, who specialises in politics and polling at Virginia's George Mason University, said: \"There are big potholes for Romney. If he loses Ohio, it will reignite the speculation about another candidate coming in late, though I don't think that will happen.\" Santorum, as well as seeing his lead evaporate in Ohio, has also seen his double-digit lead over Romney narrow in Tennessee. A PPP poll showed him only 5% ahead. PPP showed Gingrich with 47% in Georgia to Romney's 24%. Romney's support is mainly in urban areas with Santorum doing better in rural areas, and among Christian evangelicals and other social conservatives. Ahead of last week's primary in Michigan, Santorum had been ahead in the polls but then lost, partly because of outspoken remarks about separation of church and state, abortion, contraception and university education. Having apparently learned that lesson, Santorum spoke for more than 30 minutes and avoided such issues. He spoke instead about his own life story, Romney and Obama, energy, bringing jobs back from abroad and limited government. He claimed taxing the rich would not work: it had been tried in Britain over the last year and not worked. Jo Ann Di Cuirci, 64, a teacher at the Christian school, said she was not disappointed that Santorum had largely avoided social issues. \"I pretty much know where he is coming from,\" she said. She added: \"I believe in his values - sanctity of life and trying to get the country back on track, at least morally and spiritually. He would have prayer support from people. I think he would support Israel.\" In Georgia, Gingrich criticised Romney for being ultra-rich and out of touch with ordinary Americans. Gingrich has been campaigning on the issue of rising petrol prices. \"Well, look, if you're Mitt Romney and you're rich enough, maybe you don't get it,\" Gingrich said on Fox News. Ron Paul, the fourth candidate, has not been campaigning aggressively in the large states, focusing instead on smaller states such as Idaho, where he hopes that proportional representation will help deliver him a big share of delegates to the party convention in Tampa in August, where the nomination will be formally decided.",

      "bodyText": "The largest shareholder in Misys has made a last minute bid to break up its merger with Swiss rival Temenos and take control of the British banking software group. ValueAct, the US activist investor which owns 21% of Misys, said on Monday it had teamed up with private equity firm CVC Capital Partners to consider a cash offer. There is now a high likelihood of Misys making its exit from the London Stock Exchange with a payday for investors, according to analysts. Misys announced an all-share merger with its Swiss rival Temenos in February but buyout firm Vista Equity Partners gatecrashed the deal and with ValueAct now joining the fray, the price could rise as high as \u00a34 a share, valuing Misys at \u00a31.4bn, according to Jefferies bank. \"A queue of private equity bidders is now forming,\" said Jefferies analyst Milan Radia, \"and the likelihood of an exit outturn close to \u00a34 is now seemingly high.\" The deadline for Temenos to formalise its bid for Misys is 5pm on Tuesday. It is likely both parties will seek an extension so that talks can continue alongside discussions with Vista, which are due to close on 19 March, and ValueAct has until 2 April. ValueAct followed its former partner Mike Lawrie into Misys after he took the chief executive role at the British group in 2006, and could now remain involved long after his departure. Lawrie is due to return to the US to join IT services company CSC at the end of March. ValueAct chief executive Jeffrey Ubben, who sits on the Misys board, said: \"We are pleased to have teamed up with CVC to work on a potential joint offer. The proposed Misys and Temenos all share merger has strategic logic but after further consideration we have decided to evaluate whether we can make an alternative proposal that provides the certainty of cash upon completion.\" Misys, whose shares ended the day 6% higher at 335p, confirmed that it was in discussions about a cash offer for its entire share capital with ValueAct, but that talks with Temenos and Vista were continuing, and that it had formed an independent board committee, excluding Ubben, to evaluate the offers. Radia suggested Temenos should change its offer from a deal giving it 46% of the votes and the chief executive and chairman roles to a \u00a3600 million bid for the Misys banking division, or a cash offer financed by a private equity partner. The Misys board will be hoping to match the \u00a34 a share thought to have been offered last summer by US group Fidelity National Information Services in talks which failed to result in a deal. Numis has a 360p target price on the deal, equivalent to \u00a375m of savings from a merger between Misys and Temenos plus a 10% premium on the shares, because both groups have tended to trade above peers. \"Having allegedly spurned a 400p cash bid last summer, it is hard to see Misys's board being overwhelmed by 360p now, but there may be enough shareholders looking for the door that it could work,\" said Numis analyst David Toms.",

      "bodyText": "The former prime minister of Iceland has become the first politician in the world to stand trial over the 2008 financial crisis. Geir Haarde, who was ousted after Iceland's three biggest banks collapsed and the country's economy went into meltdown, could be jailed for two years if found guilty of gross negligence in failing to prepare for the impending disaster. He denied the charges and claimed that \"only in hindsight is it evident that not everything was as it should have been\". Haarde was instrumental in transforming Iceland from a fishing and whaling backwater into an international financial powerhouse before the credit crunch caused the economy to crash almost overnight. The Icelandic parliament's \"truth report\" into the causes of the crisis that forced the country to borrow $10bn (\u00a36.3bn) to prop up its economy, accused him of \"gross negligence\". He is also accused of failing to rein in the country's fast-growing banks, whose paper value before the crash had ballooned to 10 times the gross domestic product of the island state of 320,000 people. And he is alleged to have withheld information that indicated the state was headed for financial disaster. The country's three biggest banks \u2013 Glitnir, Kaupthing and Landsbanki \u2013 went bust within weeks of each other after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US sparked the credit crunch in 2008. \"None of us realised at the time that there was something fishy within the banking system itself, as now appears to have been the case,\" Haarde told the court in the capital of Reykjavik on Monday. \"I think it's illogical to think that I or anyone else in the government could have reduced the size of the banks to a greater extent than was done at the time.\" He is accused of failing to prevent the contagion from spreading to the UK by not insisting that Icelandic banks ringfence their overseas operations. The crisis sparked a diplomatic row with the UK as the demise of Landsbanki brought down its British internet banking arm, Icesave, leaving British councils, universities and hospitals more than \u00a31bn out of pocket. Gordon Brown, who was British prime minister at the time of the collapse, accused Haarde of \"unacceptable\" and illegal\" behaviour over its failure to guarantee to reimburse UK customers of the bank. The British government stepped in to protect most savers, at a cost of \u00a33.2bn but it is continuing to demand compensation from Iceland to cover the cost. The crisis also led to the demise of Baugur, the British retail investor which owned stakes in House of Fraser, Debenhams and Woolworths. Haarde, who led the right-leaning Independence party and was prime minister from 2006 to 2009, rejected all the charges as \"political persecution\" from the country's left-leaning government, and said he would be vindicated by the trial. He said Icelanders' interests were his \"guiding light\" and insisted that his conscience was clear. The trial is expected to last until mid-March, with the court taking another four to six weeks to deliver its verdict. Haarde has become the first person to ever stand trial at the country's Landsd\u00f3mur criminal court, which was created in 1905 to hear charges brought against ministers. He was one of four former Icelandic ministers blamed by the \"truth report\" for causing the crisis, but parliament voted last year that he should be the only person to stand trial. The others named in the report were the former finance minister \u00c1rni Mathiesen and former minister of commerce Bj\u00f6rgvin Sigurdsson, and Dav\u00edd Oddsson, a former prime minister who was running the country's central bank at the time.",

[I will identify this bird in 48 hours] Image: courtesy of Dave Rintoul, 6 August 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. motion-sensitive camera Question: This North American mystery bird was captured by a motion-sensitive camera on the Konza Prairie last summer. These cameras are part of an experiment to compare herbivory by large critters (e.g. bison) to grasshoppers. The cameras detect motion in an area that is not enclosed, where bison or deer might be grazing. These cameras have captured pictures of coyotes, other birds like great horned owls, etc., but the identity of this particular bird seemed ambiguous on later analysis. What taxonomic family and species of bird do you think this is? The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don't spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird's identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints so others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints may read like \"inside jokes\" and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others' enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone's enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication. You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

In a poetic flourish, she pictures the victims of a mid-air terrorist atrocity being accompanied by an array of exotic birds. Down on the ground, meanwhile, a primary school pupil with a fatal allergy to stings deliberately grabs hold of a bee. It adds a metaphysical dimension to a story inspired by the case of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 and later released on compassionate grounds. In Marshall's play, a Lockerbie-style explosion leaves behind nothing but a plume of smoke and an imagined plume of feathers. This flight of fantasy stands as a reminder that the imagination is all we have to make sense of such carnage. Without our facility for creative thought we could not piece together the forensic information, picture the victims' last moments and come up with a solution to end the violence. That's why Ross Peters has reached such a moment of import. Played by Sylvester McCoy, he is a former teacher who has instilled in his pupils the joy of the imagination. Now, 20 years after the murder of his son, he finds imagination can help him no more. Having lived with his meaningless loss, he is unable to cope with the government's decision to release the terrorist. \"Mercy is an act of the imagination,\" he says and it is an act he is unwilling to undertake. As the debate around al-Megrahi still rages, Marshall has lit upon a necessary discussion about the long-term emotional consequences of such tragedies. The role is well played by McCoy, alternating between hang-dog gloom and chirpy stoicism, with excellent support from Gemma McElhinney and Finn Den Hertog.

      "bodyText": "The leading French soprano has finally made her Wigmore Hall debut. With a programme of French song focusing on Debussy, but also encompassing Chabrier, Chausson and Duparc, Natalie Dessay could hardly have chosen better vehicles, even if her approach differs from that of the regular recitalist. For a start, she's a more dramatic, even flamboyant performer than many. Dessay's m\u00e9tier is the florid soprano territory of the mad Lucia or the somnambular Amina, and some of their lyric intensity seeped into Debussy's delicate settings, though not to their detriment. Originally intending to be a dancer or an actress before moving into opera, Dessay's understanding of these disciplines informed her platform manner as it does her stage performances. A glamorous figure, she used her arms, hands and even fingers to define each song as a small dramatic portrayal in itself; there was even a touch of the cabaret artist in the way she committed so vividly to the texts. In less able hands, this might not have worked, but Dessay's warm rapport with the audience helped vindicate her interpretative choices again and again. Her voice took a while to settle down, and there were a few moments later on when its open, edgy quality threatened to flare out of control. There was also an occasional suggestion that neither the listener nor the performer knew quite where each phrase was going, or how it would end. But that, too, formed part of Dessay's spontaneity. She made each song seem not just Debussy's or Duparc's expression, but her own. She was well partnered at the piano by Debussy specialist Philippe Cassard, who demonstrated the scale and fineness of his playing in a couple of solos, notably Faur\u00e9's Fourth Nocturne.",

But radicalism can be just as transforming when discreet, and such was the case with Iv\u00e1n Fischer's performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade with the Budapest Festival Orchestra, the closing work of their latest London concert. Rimsky's great evocation of The Thousand and One Nights is usually treated as an extrovert orchestral showstopper. Fischer, in contrast, turns it in upon itself in order to emphasise its mystery and wonder. The famous depiction of Sinbad's ship heaving on the ocean is usually treated as menacing, though Fischer, carefully controlling its dynamic swell, presents it as the low-key start of a gradually unfolding journey through the human imagination. We're reminded that the framing narrative is a love story, first reflected in the burgeoning eroticism of The Young Prince and the Princess, before reaching its resolution in the work's reconciliatory postlude. The BFO is one of the great orchestras and the playing was exceptional, with the all-important violin and harp solos exquisitely done, and everything down to the Kalandar Prince's nostalgic woodwind beautifully shaped and shaded. There were wonders in the first half, too. The concert opened with a performance of Brahms's Tragic Overture, which attained often alarming levels of intensity towards its close. This was followed by Lalo's Symphonie Espagnole with Renaud Capu\u00e7on as soloist. The work is considered fluff in some quarters; here we had the full measure of the seriousness behind its grace and wit. Capu\u00e7on played with virile agility and tremendous nobility of tone.

MWR Infosecurity told the programme: \"We found that a lot of the free applications in the top 50 apps list are using advertising inside the applications, and that the permission that you grant to these applications is also granted to the advertiser. If users knew about this I think they would be concerned about it, but at the moment I don't think they are aware of the situation and how widely their information can be used.\" The EC commissioner for justice, Viviane Reding, condemned the practice: \"This really concerns me, and this is against the law because nobody has the right to get your personal data without you agreeing to this,\" she told Channel 4 News. \"Maybe you want somebody to get this data and agree and it's fine. You're an adult and you can do whatever you want. But normally you have no idea what others are doing with your data. They are spotting you, they are following you, they are getting information about your friends, about your whereabouts about your preferences. That is certainly not what you thought you bought into when you downloaded a free-of-charge app. That's exactly what we have to change.\" Reding spoke out last week against proposed changes in Google's privacy policy, warning the search giant that she was \"not playing games\" as the French data protection commissioner, the CNIL, announced that it would lead a Europe-wide investigation into whether the changes were legal. Google implemented the changes, which it said would pull together information from across all of its services, at the start of March after announcing them in January. The code that MWR Infosecurity found gave advertising networks access to contacts, calendar and location. It came from a large US ad network called MobClix. Channel 4 said that it had not responded to repeated requests for comment. Google told Channel 4 News that it has best practises for app makers to follow when it comes to user data, but it doesn't screen applications before they are offered for download. MobClix is owned by Velti, a US-based company which claims to be the largest mobile marketing company, based on revenue, customers, consumer reach and technology holdings. Apple has recently come under fire too after it was discovered that some apps can upload all or part of the user's address book, and more recently when it was found that for both Apple and Android phones that some apps could access photos on the devices. Apple has said that it will address the weakness in a forthcoming software update. Correction: the headline on an earlier version of this article said that user data was passed to advertisers. As the story makes clear, this should have said 'ad networks'.",

If The Turn of the Screw seems a perfectly achieved unity, without musical or dramatic loose ends (though with plenty of psychological ones), it is actually a rather prescriptive work to put on stage. So much of the director's work is done already in Myfanwy Piper's libretto and Britten's music that options are limited; it's as rare to encounter a really inadequate production as it is an outstandingly original one. For NIO, director Oliver Mears opts for a harmless updating, transplanting Henry James's story to the 1950s, the time of the opera's composition, mostly making just cosmetic adjustments. Sensibly, Mears keeps his options slightly open, but seems to suggest that what takes place is entirely a product of the Governess's imagination. Both Andrew Tortise's disconcertingly understated Peter Quint and Giselle Allen's predatory Miss Jessel are only ever seen on stage in the presence of Fiona Murphy's Governess, while Thomas Copeland's priggish Miles \u2013 in his bow tie and shorts looking alarmingly like photographs of the young Britten himself \u2013 addresses his last words, \"You devil\", very obviously to her rather than to Quint. Apart from one or two touches \u2013 why does the Governess's mouth fill with blood at the end of the first act, for instance? \u2013 it is a clear, thoroughly effective staging. Yvonne Howard's Mrs Grose, with cast-iron perm, surgical stockings and Dame Edna specs, is superbly done, while Lucia Vernon's Flora grows visibly in maturity and disdain as the opera goes on.

      "bodyText": "Even for the biggest news organizations in the world, Syria is one of the most challenging locations to report from. A number of reporters \u2013 from novice citizen journalists to the world's most venerated war correspondents \u2013 have died covering the conflict there. Yet without the backing of a media company and with little experience as journalists, two Americans, William Gagan, 30, and Geoffery Shivley, 29, decided to enter Syria in a risky attempt to film inside the divided country. They crossed the border from Turkey earlier this month with a defector from President Bashar al-Assad's military, the same forces they hoped to observe in the field. Some might regard their escapade as at best naive and at worst foolhardy; they insist they took sensible precautions and were motivated by a desire to help a suffering people. The pair managed to enter Syria on three occasions, totaling approximately 10 to 15 hours in the country near the Turkish border town of Guvecci. They have returned with footage of their surreptitious entry, as well as two interviews from inside a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey and video from a pro-Assad rally in the president's Turkish hometown. They also recorded a plea from FSA fighters for foreign intervention and arms. Prior to Syria, Shivley, from Newport Beach, California, spent most of his adult life working in computer security. In the last year he has provided online support for the Occupy movement. He is currently an agent with the \"hacktivist\" news agency Telecomix, which provided the pair with online security and support throughout their time in the region. Six months ago, Gagan, from San Francisco, was serving drinks in a bar and going to college. He too was drawn to Occupy and describes himself as \"an independent citizen journalist\" covering the movement. Gagan says reporting on Occupy helped prepare him to cover conditions in Syria. He refers back to an Occupy Oakland action on 28 January that he covered via live stream. Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets and number of clashes with police ensued. \"All hell broke loose and I was in the middle of it every time,\" Gagan said. \"I've almost felt invincible and thought, 'Screw it, go live stream from Syria,'\" he explained. Over the course of two weeks, he laid out preparations to do just that. According to Gagan, he \"organized it very quickly\". Gagan flew alone from Los Angeles on 17 February and arrived in Istanbul, Turkey the following day. He had \"only one contact\" in the country, whom he met on Twitter. He planned to sneak into Syria and report on his observations via live stream, as he had done with Occupy actions in the United States. Shivley joined him later after raising some money online. \"I was going to get some truths out of the trip. I was going to find out what was really going on, if the mainstream media was reporting the truth of the conflict or if there was a whole different story not being told,\" he said. Gagan said he had been following developments in Syria \"very closely\", reading news reports and watching videos. He did not, however, feel it was worth spending time researching Syrian history. \"I knew about the parties and the Sunnis and I looked up a little of Assad's background and whatnot but I didn't really think any of that was relevant,\" he added. \"The fact of the matter is people were dying and that's what I was going there to try to help.\" The two say they had contacts in at least four countries monitoring their progress in case anything went wrong and carried an extensive array of electronics and satellite tracking equipment. They also said they informed the US embassy in Turkey of their plans but said they received no contact from US officials prior to entering Syria. Gagan and Shivley focused their attention on issues particular to Syria's border regions; namely the ease with which they entered the country and the state of Syrian refugee camps in Turkey. Video recorded by the two shows them stepping over razor-wire as they entered Syria in the middle of the day on 25 February, near an apparently unmanned Turkish guard tower. Having observed high levels of security elsewhere along the border \u2013 and given that they were in view of another armed Turkish outpost when they entered and exited Syria \u2013 led Gagan to conclude that the Turkish government is turning a blind eye to border crossings at their point of access. \"They're secretly trying to help,\" he said. \"I felt like the Turkish military are not there for a reason. They're letting the FSA make that crossing to get supplies,\" Gagan added, saying that the FSA were happy for them to film and publish the footage. He said weapons are kept in a town on the Turkish side of the border. \"We know the town that these guys were going to, to be honest, the FSA were traveling to, has weapons in it.\" The pair paid the same Syrian defector who led them across the border to join their translator in secretly entering a Syrian refugee camp on the Turkish side of the border. At great personal risk, the men managed to record two interviews while inside the camp. Shivley described how difficult it is to acquire information from within the camps: \"You have to file papers with the local municipality where the refugee camp is hosted and if you get permission to go to the camp, you either get a pre-selected interview in a well-defined area for only 15 minutes or they'll take your camera in for you, get you some footage and come out.\" Already, the pair are facing criticism for their trip: many comments under their video on YouTube are negative. One says: \"Gagan \u2013 you shouldn't be running around putting people in danger because you're on a 'little' adventure. Seriously reprehinsible behaviour.\" Gagan rejects the argument that reporting in Syria and in similar conflicts should be left to experienced journalists. \"To be honest, yes, there's some experience that these people have under their belt. They've been in these war zones circumstances, but I really feel that it doesn't matter when you're on the ground. Bullets don't discriminate.\"",

      "bodyText": "The whip rules that will operate at the Cheltenham Festival next week will come into force on Tuesday following the publication by the British Horseracing Authority on Monday of detailed guidelines to allow stewards to exercise greater discretion when deciding if a rider has breached the regulations. From Tuesday afternoon a single stroke of the whip over the limit of seven on the Flat and eight in jumps races will no longer represent an automatic offence. Instead local officials will consider the manner in which a whip has been used, including the degree of force, the purpose of its use and whether a horse is continuing to respond. They can also choose to disregard strokes that help a horse to maintain a challenging position or correct a horse that is hanging or running down a fence, or if the whip makes \"only light\" contact. In addition stewards will now have a new power to impose a fine of up to \u00a310,000 for a whip offence that takes place in a valuable race, such as those at next week's Festival, where, according to the BHA, \"the incentive to breach the rules is greater\". The new power applies to all jump races worth more than \u00a320,000 and all Flat events with a purse above \u00a327,500. The latest rewriting of the whip rules comes nearly five months after the BHA introduced a tough new regime in mid-October, a few days before the inaugural Champions Day at Ascot. That showpiece event proved controversial, in particular when Christophe Soumillon was banned and fined for a single stroke over the limit in the feature race, the Champion Stakes. The BHA will now hope that allowing the stewards to use their common sense will prevent the whip from overshadowing Cheltenham too. Paul Bittar, chief executive of the authority, said the sport's focus over the coming weeks should now be \"on Cheltenham and Aintree, the climax to what has been a fantastic jumps season and then on to the start of what promises to be another vintage year for Flat racing\". Bittar admitted that \"the subject of the whip and how its use is regulated remains an emotive subject, not only for those who make their living from the sport but also for the public who come racing and those who watch our sport on television.\" However, he remains \"confident in our ability as a sport to manage welfare issues and I believe that taking account of the design, together with the lower thresholds for the use of the whip, we have effectively removed the potential for use of the whip to be a welfare problem.\" Jamie Stier, the BHA's Director of Raceday Operations and Regulation, has been closely identified with the strict new whip regime since its introduction last year. Stier said that he has \"confidence in both the jockeys and stewards to apply their judgment judiciously in this matter\" but stressed that \"it is important that riders do not misinterpret [the use of discretion] as a reason to use their whip more than they do at present.\" He added: \"The objective is to maintain the improved standards of riding which have resulted from the significant efforts made by riders to abide by the reduction in the threshold levels \u2026 while applying discretion where it is warranted.\" Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys' Association, said that the PJA will now \"do what we can in the short time we have before the rule comes into force to ensure jockeys are aware of what the revised approached to the rules means for them\". Jockeys will start Tuesday's racing with a \"clean slate\", as breaches committed under previous versions of the rules will not count towards a process that will see jockeys referred to London for further punishment after four bans of seven days, or five minor suspensions, in a six-month period. \"Hopefully this can now be the start of everyone's focus being on the sport itself,\" Struthers said, \"as opposed to the regulation of it.\"",

In 1925, Floyd Collins was exploring the network of caves beneath his father's farm when he became trapped. For two weeks his life and slow death became front-page news, particularly when a young reporter on the local paper, William Miller, managed to reach Collins and send back first-hand reports of the man's physical and mental condition. But as time went on and all rescue attempts faltered, Collin's fate was sealed. While below ground, Collins wasted away in the dark with only the crickets for company, above ground there was a carnival atmosphere as the press gathered, sightseers came to gawp, souvenir stalls sprung up and the young film industry descended to turn an unfolding tragedy into entertainment. American composer and lyricist Adam Guettel has done just that in a show that excavates the story's metaphorical meanings to astonishingly good effect, even if the set-up of an isolated man stuck for the entire show down a hole is inevitably a rather static one. The show soars in the second half when the hand-wringing, ineffectual and often cowardly above-ground world collides with fantasy in Collins's rising delirium. His face may be in the dirt but his mind is right up there with the stars. The score is always intricate, plaintive, and touched by the spirit of bluegrass and country music. Derek Bond's staging, with its ample use of ladders, is clever and sometimes inspired; the shadowy, cavernous space becomes an extra character in the drama. But Southwark's vaults, always something of an acoustic tomb, sell the show short, even without the serious technical hitches that affected the production on the night I saw it. The sound is often unbalanced and the lyrics indecipherable, and if you can't hear the words, it robs the show of the emotional engagement necessary to sustain it through some of the underwhelming characterisations of Tina Landau's book. Guettel's daring musical, which has been praised by Sondheim but not yet achieved popular success, could yet shine in the dark, but sadly this ill-chosen space crushes the life out of it, despite the best efforts of Glenn Carter's trapped caver and a game cast.",

      "bodyText": "The Times fell at the first hurdle over horsegate. It underplayed the story, running only a paragraph when news emerged of Rebekah Brooks having been loaned Raisa by the Metropolitan police and then carrying an even less prominent par when prime minister David Cameron admitted having ridden the beast. Other papers were keen to promote their role in the affair, most notably the Daily Telegraph, which detailed how it had forced Cameron into his confession. After conceding that the London Evening Standard had broken the story, it gave a blow-by-blow account of how its senior political correspondent, Christopher Hope, had raised the subject with Cameron's \"official spokesman\" and three consecutive lobby briefings. It is a fascinating account of the way in which a spokesman can obfuscate while attempting to imply that questions about such matters were too trivial to be worthy of comment. As Hope pursues his prey, you can also sense that Cameron really could not go on issuing non-denial denials. Yesterday, the Mail on Sunday's Simon Walters weighed in with a piece about how \"No 10\" had misled the paper about the controversy. He claimed that \"Downing Street spent more than a year\" trying to conceal Cameron's horse-riding links with Brooks, the former chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper division, and her husband, Charlie. Walters wrote: \"Acting on a tip-off in late 2010, in the early days of the News International phone-hacking scandal which led to Mrs Brooks's resignation, this newspaper asked No\u200910 to confirm that Mr Cameron had been riding with Mr Brooks. A well-placed source said the pair had been out together and that Mr Brooks had been helping Mr Cameron improve his hunting style. The Mail on Sunday put the story to Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor employed as Mr Cameron's head of communications at No\u200910. He denied the claims, stating that the prime minister had not had lessons from Mr Brooks and had not been riding with him. On Friday, Mr Cameron finally confessed, 'I did go riding with Mr Brooks and one of them was this police horse Raisa.'\" It seems that the prime minister, like News International, prefers not to answer direct factual questions in a straightforward manner. Perhaps he'd like to explain why to that judicial inquiry he set up, the one his education minister, Michael Gove, has just criticised as having a chilling effect on investigative journalism.

      "bodyText": "Two men have been convicted of involvement in the UK's largest Ponzi fraud, which saw hundreds of people \u2013 among them the former cricketer Darren Gough and the actor Frances de la Tour \u2013 lose \u00a3115m. John Anderson, 46, and Kenneth Peacock, 43 were found guilty of unauthorised regulated activity at Southwark crown court in London on Monday, but were cleared of one count each of fraud. The jury is still deliberating over allegations that they deceived investors. The scheme's mastermind, Kautilya Pruthi, 41, of Wandsworth, London, has pleaded guilty to the fraud and is due to be sentenced later this week. Ponzi frauds \u2013 which take their name from the Italian conman Charles Ponzi, who was particularly fond of employing the scheme \u2013 use cash from new investors to pay returns to existing investors and depend on a constant stream of new investors to fund the payouts. The court heard that Gough and the actor and singer Jerome Flynn are each thought to have lost up to \u00a31m in the fraud, which also duped De la Tour. Victims handed over their cash to Pruthi, who promised them safe investments with returns of up to 13%. Instead, he spent their money on entertaining women, paying his daughter's private school fees and chartering helicopters. He also bought a private jet and built a car collection that included three Bentleys, a Lamborghini, two Ferraris, two Mercedes, a Rolls Royce, a Jaguar and a Maserati. \"Mr Pruthi is believed to be the UKs most successful Ponzi fraudster,\" said David Aaronberg QC, prosecuting. \"He obtained some \u00a338m from investors and caused contractual losses of over \u00a3115m.\" Aaronberg added: \"He enjoyed the company of women and was generous in the payments he made to a number of female friends, for whom he bought cars as presents, in total giving them \u00a3373,149.\" Indian-born Pruthi came to the UK in 2004 having been deported to his homeland after serving a sentence for faking documents in the US. Jurors heard that on coming to the country, Pruthi was quickly able to pose as \"a wealthy individual\". After setting up his company, Business Consulting International, said Aaronberg, Pruthi accepted deposits and \"orchestrated a large-scale and sophisticated collective investment scheme\". He would send personally tailored emails claiming he could offer up to 13% returns on 12-month investments because the scheme was available to a limited clientele. But in reality, said the prosecutor, he was \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\". Pruthi, who was not registered with or authorised by the FSA, admitted four counts of obtaining money transfers by deception, one of participating in a fraudulent business, one of unauthorised regulated activity and one count of converting and removing criminal property. Peacock, of West Hampstead, north London, and Anderson, of Surrey, are alleged to have acted as \"aggregators\" who pooled funds from third parties and then passed them on to Pruthi, who had duped them into the fraud at the outset. Eventually the scheme collapsed as there were not enough new investors to bring in the money needed to keep the old investors happy. \"The scale of this scheme was vast and the losses were immense; several investors lost their homes, others have been declared bankrupt,\" said Aaronberg. \"The monies which Pruthi received were generally not invested anywhere, neither in the UK nor abroad.\" According to the prosecution, of the \u00a338,631,792 Pruthi obtained, \u00a328m was used to pay back other investors, while \u00a310m was siphoned off for Pruthi's \"lavish lifestyle\". The case continues.",

He also bought a private jet and built a car collection that included three Bentleys, a Lamborghini, two Ferraris, two Mercedes, a Rolls Royce, a Jaguar and a Maserati.</p> <p>\"Mr Pruthi is believed to be the UKs most successful Ponzi fraudster,\" said David Aaronberg QC, prosecuting. \"He obtained some \u00a338m from investors and caused contractual losses of over \u00a3115m.\"</p> <p>Aaronberg added: \"He enjoyed the company of women and was generous in the payments he made to a number of female friends, for whom he bought cars as presents, in total giving them \u00a3373,149.\"</p> <p>Indian-born Pruthi came to the UK in 2004 having been deported to his homeland after serving a sentence for faking documents in the US.</p> <p>Jurors heard that on coming to the country, Pruthi was quickly able to pose as \"a wealthy individual\".</p> <p>After setting up his company, Business Consulting International, said Aaronberg, Pruthi accepted deposits and \"orchestrated a large-scale and sophisticated collective investment scheme\".</p> <p>He would send personally tailored emails claiming he could offer up to 13% returns on 12-month investments because the scheme was available to a limited clientele. But in reality, said the prosecutor, he was \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\".</p> <p>Pruthi, who was not registered with or authorised by the FSA, admitted four counts of obtaining money transfers by deception, one of participating in a fraudulent business, one of unauthorised regulated activity and one count of converting and removing criminal property.</p> <p>Peacock, of West Hampstead, north London, and Anderson, of Surrey, are alleged to have acted as \"aggregators\" who pooled funds from third parties and then passed them on to Pruthi, who had duped them into the fraud at the outset.</p> <p>Eventually the scheme collapsed as there were not enough new investors to bring in the money needed to keep the old investors happy.</p> <p>\"The scale of this scheme was vast and the losses were immense; several investors lost their homes, others have been declared bankrupt,\" said Aaronberg.</p> <p>\"The monies which Pruthi received were generally not invested anywhere, neither in the UK nor abroad.\" According to the prosecution, of the \u00a338,631,792 Pruthi obtained, \u00a328m was used to pay back other investors, while \u00a310m was siphoned off for Pruthi's \"lavish lifestyle\".</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",

The former deputy prime minister, who intends to stand in the first elections for police and crime commissioners (PCC) this November, said he found the \u00a31.5bn contract drawn up by the West Midlands and Surrey police inviting bids to provide a wide range of services to be a grave threat to traditional policing. \"This is extremely alarming, fundamental change to our police system. It needs to be nipped in the bud now. This is about replacing bobbies on the beat with security people.\" He said his opposition would form part of his manifesto if he were adopted as the Labour PCC candidate for Humberside: \"The police are already having 20% of their monies cut,\" he said. \"They are losing 16,000 staff nationally and this is the plan to fill the gap \u2013 with security people? That is not acceptable.\" His warning came as the British Security Industry Association, which represents 14 leading private security companies already involved in policing, welcomed the opportunity to take over certain police functions. Robbie Calder, the chair of BSIA's policing and public services section, said: \"At present our police officers perform far too many tasks that don't necessarily require the presence of a warranted officer, for example, managing cordons, area searches and taking witness statements. The introduction of a new era of regulation, including company registration, will hopefully serve to increase police confidence in working alongside our industry.\" The industry's trade body said companies such as G4S and Reliance already carried out local authority and resident street patrols, ran town centre CCTV schemes, served court warrants, protected crime scenes and were responsible for court security and immigration services. The Home Office has insisted that the private sector can help make \"behind the scenes\" functions more efficient, freeing up police officers for frontline work. \"Only police officers have the power of arrest and they will continue to patrol the streets, respond to 999 calls and lead investigations,\" a spokesman said. \"The last government in which John Prescott was deputy prime minister introduced private sector involvement in police forces. Policing will remain a public service, accountable to people through elected police and crime commissioners.\" Calls to 999 in at least one police force, Cleveland, are already being handled by a private company, Steria, while call handling and a range of other services are about to be transferred to G4S in Lincolnshire, along with the detention of suspects in custody suites. It comes as 160 staff and a range of \"back office\" services are to be transferred back to the public sector in Avon and Somerset. They had been taken over by Southwest One in 2007 under a joint venture between IBM, Somerset council, the Avon and Somerset police and Taunton Deane borough council. The U-turn follows losses of \u00a331m and failures to hit savings targets.",

      "bodyText": "The French may be particularly fond of them, but this is not just another conspiracy theory; it's a statement from Germany's most influential investigative news magazine Der Spiegel. This week's edition spells it out rather eloquently: a European coalition of rightwing leaders has discreetly formed to boycott France's Socialist presidential candidate Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. The last few months have indeed felt unusual. There was Barack Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy's double act on primetime French television back in November, Angela Merkel's recent steadfast and unambiguous endorsement for the rightwing candidate and, finally, David Cameron's slightly more nuanced support at a joint press conference in Paris during the last Anglo-French summit. In short, world leaders have gone out of their way to show that, if they voted in the French presidential elections, they'd vote for Sarkozy. Problem is, they don't. And there's another issue \u2013 it's called meddling in another country's internal affairs. Do it at your own peril. The French first took this strange carousel as a sign of their president's desperate attempt at winning them back, like an insecure child inviting all his classmates for his birthday \u2013 even those he doesn't like \u2013 to appear more popular than he really is. In the last couple of weeks, Sarkozy has even asked Rachida Dati, his former justice minister with whom he fell out very publicly, to open a rally in Lille in front of bemused UMP sympathisers who never thought they'd see her again. He has also, of all people, managed to get his second wife C\u00e9cilia (who said at the time of their divorce that he had no dignity and didn't love his children) to back him on French television. Every little helps, it seems. Desperate as he is to be re-elected, there is no doubt that Sarkozy encouraged this anti-Hollande coalition. He may even have demanded it from his European partners, in exchange of past favours and future God-knows-what. It has, however, been a long tradition for the two main French presidential candidates to be received by France's closest allies during presidential campaigns; Germany, Spain, Italy, Britain, the US and Japan, among others. Socialist S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal was granted a meeting with Angela Merkel in 2007 \u2013 so were presidential hopefuls Jacques Chirac, Lionel Jospin and Edouard Balladur by Helmut Kohl in 1995. However, recent rebuffs from Spain's Mariano Rajoy, Italy's Mario Monti, Germany's Merkel, Britain's Cameron, and even from Obama, to Hollande's requests to meet sound unparalleled. Asked about it Hollande, decidedly l'homme tranquille, replied with a smile that he \"always liked to see world leaders being so nice to each other\". Nevertheless, the 56% of French people saying they want Hollande as their next president might soon start feeling a little irritated. And Sarkozy's continental blockade may well end up in tears for him. It is extremely short-sighted of European leaders to boycott the man who has been continually leading the polls for months. It would have been in their interest to meet him, as they may very soon be working together. Antagonising a potential future French president is simply not a clever thing to do. If we look back 200 years or so, France has often been surrounded by hostile and reactionary coalitions. It did wonders for the country's cohesion, unity and sense of identity. Sarkozy's five years in power have proved divisive for French society, and a coalition of his European acolytes might just provide the cement the French need. In fact, Hollande may be on to something with his plan to renegotiate the European treaty and tax the uber-rich by 75%. Could it be that a majority of Europeans would also favour such plans in their home country? Could it be that some of Hollande's proposals feel too fiery for austerity tsars Cameron, Merkel, Monti and Rajoy? We will have our answer on 6 May.",

      "bodyText": "1) The bilingual boss Sitting on the back row of the press box at the DW Stadium has many benefits. It's a cracking view, you can sometimes pick up some gossip from earwigging the Wigan directors sitting immediately behind and best of all is the chance to listen to an 80-minute commentary on the match \u2013 and often the refereeing performance \u2013 from the visiting coach, who is allocated a seat on the front row of the directors' box. That is invariably an education, providing an insight into how much more insight these guys at the sharp end have than us punters. Merely managing the 10 interchanges would be a tricky enough task \u2013 although not as all-consuming as when unlimited interchanges were unilaterally introduced by the Aussies before the 1999 Tri-Nations Series, and poor old Andy Goodway, then the Great Britain coach, spent most of a defeat by the Kangaroos in Brisbane trying to work out with his assistant, David Myles, which players were on the pitch and which on the bench. But as well as deciding who should come on when, the Super League coach has to assess how the game is going and respond accordingly. It's a seriously complicated business, showing why only the sharpest ex-players can enjoy success. However, the really striking discovery having listened to the Catalans' coach, Trent Robinson, during his team's defeat at Wigan on Sunday was that he has to react in two languages. One minute he'd be barking out instructions to one of his runners down on the sidelines in English \u2013 \"make the next change quick, tell the guys to work harder at the ruck, etc\"; the next he'd be talking to another of his assistants in French. There are many reasons why Robinson has proved an outstanding appointment for Super League's French club: the huge on-field improvement which has them down as genuine challengers this season notwithstanding the defeat they suffered at the DW; the intelligent signings of overseas players such as Scott Dureau and especially Jason Baitieri, who is also bilingual and has a similar affinity for the French game; and his determination to establish a genuinely French culture at the Dragons, whereas under his predecessor, Kevin Walters, they talked and played like a bunch of exiled Aussies. But his ability to coach in two languages is surely unique in the rugby league world. 2) Loss of Roby not rosy for Royce While Robinson's stock is currently so high that it will not be affected by a defeat at Wigan \u2013 the Dragons' first of the season \u2013 these are much tougher times for three of his Super League coaching rivals. There is no great surprise that two of the three clubs who are currently flirting with crisis are Widnes and London Broncos, neither of whom have managed a win from their first five fixtures. Widnes have returned to the elite after a six-season absence with a blatantly inadequate squad, for whatever reasons, and the Broncos were always going to struggle, given the toughest possible run of opening games \u2013 and, although that alibi expired in Friday night's heavy defeat at Salford, plenty of other teams will come unstuck against the City Reds this season if they keep playing like that. So Denis Betts and Rob Powell, the respective coaches at the Stobart Stadium and The Stoop, can't be totally shocked to find themselves on the receiving end of some stick and must remain reasonably confident of riding out the storm \u2013 although it would not be a huge surprise if the former Great Britain coaching veteran Brian Noble, who is due back from Australia this week, receives a call from the Broncos owner, David Hughes, to lend the benefit of his experience to Powell. However, few would have predicted the problems that Royce Simmons has encountered in his second season at St Helens. Simmons did an outstanding job last year, with his vast experience and engaging personality proving ideal to steer Saints through a tricky transitional year following the loss of the twin icons of Keiron Cunningham and Knowsley Road. He might have thought the job would be comparatively plain sailing this season, with the club in a smart new home of their own at Langtree Park and their talented collection of youngsters benefiting from the experience they gained during last year's various injury crises. Instead Simmons has been horribly undermined by speculation that Saints have already lined up the Huddersfield coach Nathan Brown to succeed him next season; the team are languishing in mid-table after taking only one point from their last three matches; and now James Roby, Cunningham's successor as hooker who is one of the most influential players in the whole Super League competition, is facing a lengthy absence after being injured in Sunday's defeat at Huddersfield. Saints are at home to Hull, Simmons' former employers, on Friday night before going to Bradford the following weekend and they desperately need to win those two games ahead of a daunting trio of fixtures against Leeds, Warrington and then at home to Wigan on Good Friday. But without Roby the task becomes so much harder. 3) Bridge collapse causes concern The biggest talking point of the whole Super League weekend came at Odsal on Saturday evening, when the Warrington centre Chris Bridge escaped scot free for dropping an elbow nastily into the chest of the prone and helpless Bulls stand-off Ben Jeffries. Bridge will have to explain himself to the disciplinary authorities and may well be suspended from Friday's trip to Leeds but that will be no good to Bradford, who were on the wrong end of several other marginal decisions that undermined a hugely improved home performance. This raises a couple of issues. First, the referees and touch judges really do need to be more aware of the image of the game, and the primary importance of protecting players from foul play \u2013 as a classy centre Bridge is more often the victim than the transgressor and Warrington have been on the wrong end of enough unpunished rough stuff in recent years to appreciate the need to stamp it out. Second, if a game is televised, why couldn't the video referee also have a role for incidents that have been missed by all the on-field officials? Bridge's foul was not the worst that has gone unpunished this season but surely there's an argument he could have been sent to the sin-bin for 10 minutes to give Bradford at least a temporary advantage, before the disciplinary authorities decide whether he should be suspended from subsequent fixtures. 4) A New England? To more cheerful matters. Wigan were as formidable on Sunday afternoon as Salford had been freewheeling on Friday night and it sounds as if the Huddersfield-Saints game was a classic. That's all good news for the England coach, Steve McNamara, who will announce a 32-man elite training squad on Tuesday. Who will be promoted from last year's Knights set-up? You'd have thought that Lee Mossop and Josh Charnley are strong contenders from Wigan \u2013 and possibly even Gareth Hock? Kallum Watkins leads a clutch of young thrusters from Leeds, and Castleford offer Richard Owen or even Daryl Clark. How about Gary Wheeler and Tommy Makinson from St Helens, Jermaine McGillvary and Larne Patrick from Huddersfield, or Mike Cooper and Stefan Ratchford from Warrington? And while we're on the subject, what would be your first-choice England team if the Exiles double header was on next weekend, as opposed to mid-June? 5) Griffiths resumes the Crusade Now that the group stages of the Northern Rail Cup are complete, it's time for the start of the Co-operative Championship competition, which kicks off with a game between Leigh and Batley on Thursday night, the first under a new broadcasting agreement with Premier Sports. Batley's win at Featherstone on Sunday, which maintained their 100% record in the Northern Rail, suggests they will continue to overachieve in relation to their modest attendances at Mount Pleasant following the appointment of John Kear as coach to succeed Karl Harrison, who has moved to the comparative moneybags of Halifax. Fax and Fev would seem to be the stand-out teams but I've already been rebuked for suggesting as much on Twitter, especially by Sheffield Eagles supporters who point out that they beat Fax to reach last season's Grand Final. But the most welcome story of next weekend will be the debut of the North Wales Crusaders in the Championship One competition and the return to league of Clive Griffiths, with a tough home game against Barrow at the Racecourse on Sunday afternoon. Despite the debacle that unfolded after the previous Crusaders regime withdrew their application for a Super League licence last summer, so much progress was made in the Wrexham area over the last couple of years, and hats off to the supporters for ensuring that it was not all wasted. There are plenty of other good stories in Championship One. Six Cumbrian derbies, with Barrow, Whitehaven and Workington all likely to be in the thick of the promotion battle. Paul Cooke and now Kieran Hyde at Doncaster. A Welsh State of Origin, as it has been somewhat optimistically dubbed, between Griffiths' northern Crusaders and the Neath-based Scorpions, with their strong links to Wigan, in the south. Even the London Skolars and Gateshead Thunder, who have both struggled in recent years, are showing signs of a revival. 6) Stay in touch Finally, the first any other business of the season. A plug for the Touchathon, a 24-hour touch rugby marathon, which will again be held in Salford, this year on 2-3 May, to raise funds for Manchester's Christie cancer hospital and other charities supported by the Steve Prescott Foundation. An example of rugby league folk rallying round: before Sunday's game between Wakefield and Huddersfield at Belle Vue a cheque will be presented to Don Purdy, whose son Leon was born suffering from congenital heart disease \u2013 a condition that resonates throughout rugby league following the recent tragic loss of Ian Millward's teenage son Robbie, and especially in Wakefield after Adam Watene and Leon Walker were cut off in their playing prime. Then there's the opening weekend of the NRL. A stunning kick-off in Newcastle last Thursday, a second match going into golden-point extra time at Leichardt Oval on Sunday, a cracker between Manly and the Warriors in Auckland in front of 37,000 at Eden Park, and by all accounts the most dramatic finish of all as the Roosters came back from the dead to beat the Rabbits in Monday Night Football.

David Fleming, Unite's national officer, said: \"These highly skilled workers in the finance function of the bank can earn as little as \u00a322,500 per year. Instead of sending financial services work from the UK to a low-wage economy, RBS should ensure employees are able to get on with the work they do so well. Why is RBS awarding the investment bankers massive bonuses yet sacking thousands of workers?\" He said the impact would be felt mainly in Edinburgh, where RBS has its head office, and in London. The job losses affect 215 full-time staff and 83 temporary positions, mostly in the finance departments that support key RBS divisions such as corporate banking. The bank said: \"As we work to rebuild RBS we continue to streamline our business to ensure that we remain competitive. We have embarked upon a three-year transformation programme across our finance division which will increase efficiency and allow us to serve our customers better. \"The movement of roles between countries reflects the global nature of our business and the need to locate our people close to the customers they serve. Having to cut jobs is the most difficult part of our work to rebuild RBS. We will do all we can to support our staff, offer redeployment opportunities where possible and keep compulsory redundancies to an absolute minimum.\" RBS's chief executive, Stephen Hester, who has said his job is equivalent to defusing the \"biggest time bomb in history\", has shrunk the bank's assets by more than \u00a3700bn and cut more than 35,000 jobs since he took over from Fred Goodwin in 2008. Last month, RBS pleaded to be treated as a fully commercial business as it confirmed it was paying out \u00a3785m in bonuses despite recording a deficit of \u00a32bn in 2011. As the bank announced a fourth consecutive year of losses since its bailout in October 2008, its chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, argued that RBS needed to be run on \"commercial grounds\" if taxpayers were to get their \u00a345bn investment repaid. The state is currently sitting on a \u00a320bn loss on its 82% stake.",

      "bodyText": "It was conceived as a project that would foster dialogue between Muslims and non-Muslims and act as a bridge between Islam and Christianity. But the completion of a controversial multimillion euro mosque and culture complex is under threat after a prolonged row between its German architect and its Turkish developers. The Cologne Central Mosque, which was due for completion this summer, has been dogged by controversy since its inception in 2006. But it is now at the centre of a row over everything from soaring building costs and the colour of its facade to allegations that Christian symbols have been secretly hidden in its construction. Architect Paul B\u00f6hm and Ditib, a branch of the Turkish government's religious affairs authority, have tentatively agreed to continue with the project but only after the intervention of a retired Cologne mayor. Fritz Schramma said the parties, whom he unambiguously referred to as \"combatants\", had agreed to complete the project to create a \"transparent, open mosque\", but only after much intense dialogue. He said he hoped the mosque would \"soon be filled with life\". B\u00f6hm's domed mosque, which borrows features from the Ottoman architectural style and has a 55m-high minaret and space for 1,200 worshippers, is destined to become Germany's biggest mosque and one of Europe's largest. Its adjoining culture centre will house everything from a library and prayer rooms to a bazaar, a travel agent and a hairdressers. The architect, whose father was Gottfried B\u00f6hm, a famous architect of Catholic churches, won the commission to design the mosque six years ago. But he has since accused Ditib of a smear campaign against him after it produced a list of extra demands and, he says, repeatedly changed the building plans, causing the initial cost to soar by \u20ac17m to \u20ac34m. He was later banned from the construction site and his contract terminated, demoting him to the role of adviser. Ditib, which is responsible for 1,000 mosques in Germany, has presented B\u00f6hm with a list of 2,000 construction faults, referring to him as \"a brilliant artist but a failed construction manager\". It is objecting to the sand-coloured facade and accuses B\u00f6hm of surreptitiously working Christian symbols into the building, including crucifixes, as well as an X and a P, which together symbolise Christ. B\u00f6hm has denied the allegations. Lale Akg\u00fcn, a local Social Democrat politician of Turkish origin, has accused Ditib of becoming \"increasingly more conservative and closed, in line with the wider political picture in Turkey\", saying that the accusations about the Christian symbols had originated in Ankara. Ditib has refused to comment, except to say the project would go ahead with B\u00f6hm acting in an advisory capacity only, \"in order to follow the completion of the construction process through to the end\". Since its conception, the mosque has caused considerable tension in the city. Among its opponents are those who are against it for aesthetic reasons \u2013 including its sprawling size and towering minarets \u2013 and others, particularly the anti-immigrant movement Pro K\u00f6ln and the writer Ralph Giordano, who argue that it is a political symbol that does not belong in the city and would allow Cologne's Muslims to live in an autonomous world rather than encouraging them to integrate. But Cologne's mayor J\u00fcrgen Roters argues the city's reputation would be irreparably damaged if the mosque, whose outer shell is more or less finished, was not completed. \"It's important that our fellow Muslim citizens get their own dignified place of prayer and meeting, and that the project is not hampered by further rows or misused for anti-foreigner propaganda,\" he said. But B\u00f6hm, who has complained of unpaid bills and a concerted attempt to push him off the project, said it amounted to a \"very delicate and fragile plant\" whose completion was far from safe. \"The differences of opinion have remained,\" he said.",

When the lender said last week it would raise the cap on its SVR to 4.25%, it shocked some customers, but for many it was more of the same scandalous rate manipulation of old. Last year the regulator forced the bank to pay \u00a3500m to 300,000 customers after it had failed to reduce its SVR mortgage rate in line with the slide in Bank of England base rates. It was entitled to limit reductions after it removed a cap that restricted the SVR to 2% above base and replaced it after a year hiatus to 3%. But all this was in the small print and fooled thousands. The latest crime takes the SVR to 3.99% (with the option of moving to the cap of 4.25%) and will amount to a 14% increase in the cost of an interest-only mortgage. Mortgage customers understandably ask how Halifax, which is largely owned by the taxpayer as a shareholder in Lloyds Banking Group, can jack up monthly bills when the Bank of England is making money cheaper than ever before. Base rates at 0.5% and quantitative easing at \u00a3325bn should form the word bonanza on the lips of every bank executive. The concern must be that British banks are forced to pay higher rates on the international wholesale markets where they are considered a serious risk. Then again, we could be witnessing the aftershocks from the Greek crisis and these rate rises are the last for now. Ray Boulger at broker John Charcol subscribes to the latter.

Stanley (population 2,500) is often a sleepy place at the weekend. It was half-term. The sun, for once, was shining. And most importantly, perhaps, there were unlikely to be many of the journalists around who have converged here as the 30th anniversary of the Falklands war has approached and Britain and Argentina have refought the conflict rhetorically. The weekly civilian flight leaves early on Saturday afternoons; by the time William walked into the Capstan gift shop on the waterfront, the media were supposed to be at the airport. But your reporter was still in town buying last-minute presents. As I rushed into the shop to grab Falklands fudge and fluffy penguins, there he was. Tall and slightly gawky, in a bright blue Lyle &amp; Scott jumper, jeans and stained trainers, and holding a half-full Capstan carrier bag, he stood in one of the aisles like some protected species of giraffe, discreetly ringed by half a dozen other browsers with a watchful air and military haircuts. For several long minutes, he pensively thumbed through books on the 1982 war. Occasionally his eyes flicked round the room. Then, with his entourage, he loped out of the shop and headed on foot along the quayside. He passed the famous wood and corrugated-iron cottages, currently bristling with British and Falklands flags, where Argentinian armoured personnel carriers once rumbled past. But no one came out to greet him. The pavement was deserted. The occasional vehicle passed without stopping. The sun beat down. William, jumper glowing, still holding his carrier bag, loped on. A request for a word with the prince was brushed aside by a security man: \"He's not doing interviews here, especially given the current situation.\" Who were the other men with William? \"He's just out with friends.\" After a few hundred yards, he reached the memorial to the British 1982 war effort. He lingered, looking at the long list of task-force vessels. Then he turned uphill, passing the short, highly charged street called Thatcher Drive, and strode towards the hospital built after the war. A few minutes later he reappeared, still on foot, heading back the way he had come. There was still no crowd: a royal walkabout without one felt both odd and faintly endearing. He passed me without catching my eye, then turned abruptly towards the public bar of Stanley's one hotel. It is called Malvina House. Its website insists it is not named after Argentina's term for the Falklands, but after \"an old Scottish name, once popular in the Falkland Islands\".

It is called Malvina House. Its website insists it is not named after Argentina's term for the Falklands, but after \"an old Scottish name, once popular in the Falkland Islands\". But the symbolism for our warrior prince was, perhaps, unfortunate. A request for a posed photograph nearby was politely turned down.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If critics feel that the voluntary sector has meekly taken more than its fair share of punishment from two years of spending cuts, it certainly came out fighting at the annual conference of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO). Keynote speaker Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, was given a roasting by the NCVO's deceptively urbane chair, former television newscaster Martyn Lewis, and was lucky then to have another appointment to go to so he did not have to endure a public dressing-down from the umbrella organisation's chief executive, Sir Stuart Etherington. The government's payment-by-results Work Programme for the unemployed, in which some charities are contractors, was starting to resemble \"a slow-motion car crash\", Etherington said. \"And I shudder at the thought that other government departments believe this is the model for the future.\" Calling on the Department for Work and Pensions to honour the government's commitment to open data and transparency in relation to the performance of the programme, he added: \"It is appalling that voluntary organisations are being gagged by contract in what they can say about it. That's appalling and it must stop.\" Alexander had come bearing gifts: a promise of (unspecified) extra funding for voluntary groups involved in advice work. But if he thought this would earn him an easy ride from Lewis in the question-and-answer session that followed his speech, he was mistaken. How could it be, Lewis asked, that councils such as Wokingham in Berkshire had still not told local voluntary organisations what their level of funding would be from 1 April? If businesses were being treated in such a way, there would be an outcry. And ministers would be leading it. Alexander sought to adopt the classic politician's defence: he was of course unable to comment on specific cases. But Lewis was having none of that and pressed him twice more. In the end, the minister confessed: \"Clearly it's not fair to say you still don't know what's going to happen with a month to go.\" After a couple more uncomfortable questions from Lewis, about public attitudes towards cuts and whether any more help for charities was in the pipeline, it was the audience's turn. Was Alexander aware of the \"chaos\" that the health and social care bill was causing on the ground? And why \u2013 this one to acclaim \u2013 had councils with the most disadvantaged communities taken the biggest cuts? The minister flannelled and prepared to make for his next appointment. But not before Lewis came back at him again: just how much extra funding for advice work would there be? Alexander wasn't going to be drawn ahead of the budget, but he did guarantee no double-counting of sums already committed. Then, to polite applause, he left. Etherington, struggling with the vocal aftermath of a heavy cold, began his attack slowly, lamenting the end of \"what you might call a golden age\" for the voluntary sector, its income having peaked in 2007-08, and fearing that the bulk of the sector's contribution was increasingly being made by a \"civic core\" of committed individuals giving a disporportionate share of time and money. While the government's open public services agenda was \"the right direction of travel\", he said, the issuing of ever-bigger service contracts threatened to exclude all but the largest charities with the strongest balance sheets \u2013 with knock-on effects on innovation and the involvement of users of services. \"It is perfectly reasonable for taxpayers to expect more value for money. But government has to accept that that the implementation of a payment-by-results model is shifting the burden of risk in the system to those least able to bear it. They also have to accept that organisations will need significant support to manage the transition.\" There were 70,000 fewer paid staff in the voluntary sector than there had been a year ago, Etherington reported. He had been particularly saddened by the demise of Young People in Focus, a charity that for 22 years had served young people and the organisations that supported them. \"I hope,\" he said, that there will not be too many more cases like this.\" \u2022 In a statement, Wokingham Borough Council said: \"Faced with a changing landscape for both public services and the voluntary sector, Wokingham Borough Council, like many local authorities, has been considering how it supports the voluntary sector to meet local priorities such as supporting our most vulnerable people. \"Over the last year Wokingham Borough Council has been reassessing the way it works with the voluntary and community sector in order to best target support for frontline, priority services. The grants budget for 2012/13 is unchanged from this financial year. \"In future, the borough council wants to directly fund voluntary and community groups to meet local priorities that will improve the quality of life for residents. We are looking at how we can move from an old system of simply funding a few groups each year through grants, which has led to so-called legacy funding \u2013 grants being paid to the same groups each year without direct reference to the community's priorities \u2013 to a new system that targets key identified priorities. \"During this transitionary period, all voluntary sector groups receiving funding have been consulted and kept up to date. Most were given informal notification before Christmas of their continued funding but formal letters of notification only go out once the Council's budget has been set; the letters are due to go out this week. As usual payments will be made at the beginning of the financial to ensure continuity of service and to help with the organisation's financial planning.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "The low lying flatlands around Valencia are still given over to growing paella rice. More than one hundred years ago, Britain was importing the staple from local co-operatives along with onions and garlic to recreate the dish that in its modern chorizo and seafood form dates back to the early 19th century. These days water shortages mean rice is almost a local novelty. Growing fruit and salad vegetables make up the bulk of food exports as the hills that surround Spain's third largest city provide the perfect environment for oranges, clementines, lemons and other citrus fruits. Cooperatives are the backbone of a key industry the new right wing government of Mariano Rajoy hopes will generate bigger export receipts and keep the country afloat. Rajoy has his work cut out. For the past five years Spanish food and drink exports have been static. Before the credit crunch exports were nudging higher, but without much impetus. A slump in 2009 was followed by a slow recovery that puts the figures for sales in 2011 only slightly ahead of the peak in 2008. The sluggish recovery of this key industry is one reason Rajoy is ready to battle the EU commission over plans for punitive fines for missing debt targets. He knows it will take time to push exports to new peaks against the headwinds of financial austerity and cheap foreign competition. Without the subsidies that propped up Spanish agriculture in the 1990s, it faces an uphill struggle, one made worse by the intense burdens of doing business in modern euroland. According to Jos\u00e9 Climent, the head of Spain's Cooperativa Agr\u00edcola, the country's largest co-op, the pressure from retailers in northern Europe to supply all year round produce, cut costs and adhere to ever-tighter environmental regulations is crushing co-ops more than the banking crisis. Climent says co-ops are too weak to comply with all the demands from the big chains after years of under investment, though he is doing his best to fight back. It is the bigger industrial concerns that can meet the needs of cost conscious and environmentally-aware consumers. Guy Dixon, commercial director of the family-controlled, private grower MartinAvarro, agrees that his firm, which has extensive citrus farms near Valencia and across the south of Spain, is better placed than the co-ops as supermarkets make ever-more stringent demands on quality, price and pesticide use. MartinAvarro has long established relationships with Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and all the other major chains to supply citrus fruits. When Valencia fruit is exhausted, the company turns to its other Spanish farms to stretch the growing season. Driving out of Valencia past its clementine and lemon groves, it is possible to see the neglect suffered by family-owned plots that make up the region's co-operative membership. Fifteen or 20 trees on a plot no bigger than a tennis court, overgrown with weeds, often augmented by a rusty piece of machinery, is a common sight. Climent believes there is almost a conspiracy against farmers with smallholdings, even when they club together in co-operatives. He exports to Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury in the UK, but reserves most of his vitriol for the German chemicals giant Bayer, which he accuses of lobbying Brussels for more environment-friendly pesticides which are weaker and must be used more often at greater cost to the grower. Climent's member-farms are also under pressure to improve the shape and colour of fruits for the supermarkets while keeping the price low. On this topic, he has another German company in his sights. \"The price of citrus fruits in Europe depends on the price decided by the chief buyer for Aldi. He sets the benchmark. But he is making 300% to 400% mark-ups on the price he pays us. And he helps Bayer because it will only accept fruit with pesticide residues that are a third of the EU level. Aldi is the strictest in Europe,\" he says. Last month, Valencian citrus farmers protested outside the city's largest Aldi and Lidl shops after the German supermarkets were accused of pushing down prices further. Martinavarro, on the other hand, has invested heavily in the latest varieties and irrigation techniques to keep up with environmental rules and the demands of northern European customers Last year he planted an Australian variety of the local Navel orange with a better taste and faster growing time. But the investment will not pay off for at least five years when it goes on the market. That ability to focus on service and invest has allowed his operation to move ahead of Climent's after an increase in annual production to 230,000 tonnes of citrus. The co-op's main processing plant sometimes struggles to maintain the 120,000 tonnes it needs to remain viable. In Madrid, Rajoy is preparing to sanction tax relief for smaller businesses to break with a past that is characterised by tightly-run family businesses, unwilling to innovate. He wants business people to be rewarded for working harder with fewer barriers to taking on staff and generating profits. Climent says he remains hopeful the co-op's fortunes will change. There are plans to upgrade the main processing plant and support more farmers to improve the quality of their fruit and their yields. But his tone is gloomy. \"The private companies have different locations and sign all-year round deals that maintain a constant supply. We can't match that. And we struggle to compete with suppliers in north Africa. We must use labour that has full employment rights compared with Morocco where packers are paid \u20ac0.85 an hour compared with our \u20ac11 an hour.\" And, adding insult to injury, they are not affected by EU environment regulations and can use two or three times as much pesticide.",

      "bodyText": "A report published today by the US-based Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ) makes for grim reading. It discovers, as if we didn't know it, that the search for a new business model to revive the newspaper industry is making only halting progress. The central revelation is that, on average, for every $1 earned by newspapers in digital advertising revenue, they lose $7 in print ad revenue. This fact emerges from the PEJ's survey of six companies that own 121 newspapers, which were persuaded to share private data about some of their papers' financial performances. \"Executives at the 13 companies involved in this report confirmed that closing the revenue gap remains an uphill and existential struggle,\" writes Tom Rosenstiel, the project's director. \"The most optimistic projections saw digital gains overcoming print losses within a few years; the most pessimistic held that it would never occur. A number of executives said they did not know when it might happen. Of the 38 papers that provided detailed data about their operations, not all were achieving growth in digital revenue. Seven of those studied suffered declines for the last year for which they had full data. One stayed the same year to year. Beneath these broad numbers, however, are papers that buck the trend in significant ways.\" Rosenstiel told the New York Times: \"Some of those we talked to seem frustrated and even uncertain about how to proceed. But we also found signs that, if you can break out of old cultural patterns, there is another way.\" He explained that papers showing signs of success \"are those that have pushed harder to change their sales staffs, have pushed digital even at the risk of putting less effort into the old categories that pay the bills, have taken more risks \u2014 have fought against the deep 'inertia' that many of the executives describe.\" The report identifies no shortage of challenges for newspapers on the sales side. Some of the papers it studied have struggled to sell mobile ads, recruit digital advertising sales representatives and profit from so-called daily deals similar to Groupon coupons. According to the report, \"only 40% of papers say targeted advertising is a major part of their sales efforts. Most papers are not putting major effort into selling 'smart' or customised digital ads.\" PEJ, which is part of the non-profit Pew research centre, considers its survey to be the first of a series on the economic shifts in the news industry. It plans to to gather paywall data in the future. Staci Kramer of paidContent argues that the report \"paints a classic damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't scenario\" because if you move too fast you have to deal with risks but if you go too slow then \"inertia becomes the greatest risk.\" She cites one unnamed executive [no company is identified] as telling the researchers: \"There's no doubt we're going out of business right now... There might be a 90% chance you'll accelerate the decline if you gamble and a 10% chance you might find the new model. No one is willing to take that chance.\" That chimes with views I've heard among British publishers too. I'll return to that theme when I look at Trinity Mirror later this week.

The background: Main Attrakionz were on the December 2011 cover of Spin magazine (along with Odd Future, A$AP Rocky, Clams Casino and several more, but they seem destined to not mean much over here, as they lack the shock(ing) charm of OF, the single charismatic focus of A$AP or the auteur appeal of Michael Volpe. That would be a shame because, banner headlines aside, Oakland's Most Blunted, barely 20, are knocking out a ton of great music seemingly at the rate of a new mixtape every other month, with as many as eight to date already to their name, including solo diversions from the two (count 'em) members and assorted collaborative projects. They've got their own in-house producer in Squadda B, but one of their most frequent collaborators is the above-cited Mr Casino, renowned maestro of the hazy, torpid ambience, the astral studio fog. Still, even when old CC's not at the helm, the stoned-to-say-the-least sound they tend to go for is the spaced-out, dreamy variety, blissed-out and melodic, slow and psychedelically intoxicating, the crisp clatter of 808s, sped-up chipmunk vocals and/or samples of indie faves such as Glasser adding to the creamy, opaque sonics and trippy atmospherics. They're calling it cloud rap \u2013 which captures its fluffy, billowing textures well enough \u2013 as well as lo-fi/bedroom rap, although to our uneducated ears it sounds expensive, perfectly lush and, well, just perfect. The great John Calvert over at the Quietus has branded this type of miasmic rap confection Nu-Tang Clam, which is neat. Of all the mixtapes bearing Main Attrakionz's name, the one to download first is 808s &amp; Dark Grapes II, which has earned them attention in not just Pitchfork and Fader et al but the New York Times. It's got a similarly somnolent mood to the Kanye album the title spoofs, although what they're commenting on in the lyrics remains unclear \u2013 lack of clarity possibly being the point, to accompany the gorgeous murk that is the production. Bossalinis &amp; Fooliyones Pt 2 sets the ethereal tone, club music doubling up as headphone nirvana with its overdubbed harmonies and ricocheting handclaps. Diamond of God keeps things blissful and billowy, with a female vocal sample that is either an R&amp;B girl or Liz Fraser of Cocteau Twins. Chuch is yet more lo-tech lavishness, chillwave ODing on purple drank: Balam Acab meets Bone Thugs N Harmony, Peso-like in its otherworldly prettiness. That man A$AP makes a cameo on Take 1, the apotheosis of MA's narcotic loveliness, blurring those ancient east-west battle lines forever, like 2Pac never happened. And this is their free stuff! What are they going to produce when they get paid? The buzz: \"These guys got crazy swag\" \u2013 ihiphop.com. The truth: Rap's dead? We can't remember when it was so alive with possibility.

      "bodyText": "Red-throated pipit, Anthus cervinus (protonym, Motacilla cervina), Pallas, 1811, also known as the vinaceous-throated pipit, photographed at the Gefersa Reservoir, 18 km west of Addis Ababa (by road), Ethiopia (Africa). Image: Dan Logen, 11 February 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D300, 600 mm lens, f/9, 1/1000 sec, ISO 800 Question: This African mystery bird is notable for sharing a character with its family members that sets it apart from all other birds in its taxonomic order. What character is that? Can you identify this bird's taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult red-throated pipit, Anthus cervinus, a member of the taxonomic family, Motacillidae, the wagtails, longclaws and pipits. Within this family, the red-throated pipit is placed into the most speciose genus, Anthus. The red-throated pipit is a long-distance migrant, breeding in the far northern reaches of Europe and Asia, with a small population that also breeds in northern Alaska, whilst wintering in Africa, southern and eastern Asia and along the western coast of the US. These birds construct their nest on the ground, typically on a hummock in a marsh, and they lay 4-6 eggs per clutch. This small and slender passerine is easily identified in its breeding plumage by its brick red face and throat. They also can be distinguished by their songs. Thanks to the talented recordists on Xeno-Canto who freely share their work, here's a male red-throated pipit singing (recorded in Norway on 1 July 1976): Recordist: Patrik \u00c5berg. But of course, a breeding-plumage bird would be too easy for you to identify. The pictured individual provides extra challenge since it is in its streaky winter plumage, with its white-streaked brown upperparts and black-streaked white underparts. Where their ranges overlap, this species can be confused with the tree pipit, A. trivialis, but the red-throated pipit is distinguished by its darker and more boldly streaked upper parts and by the heavier and thicker streaking on its flanks and, if you could see it, its rump. Males and females look alike. The red-throated pipit feeds on the ground mainly on insects, but it also eats seeds. It prefers moist open country and marshlands in the mountains and tundra. Here's a video of several red-throated pipits, foraging on the ground during spring migration (filmed on Lesvos Island, Greece, in May 2008; uploaded 4 February 2011): Visit MrRonjax's YouTube channel [video link]. One morphological trait sets the pipits and the motacillids apart from all the other passerines: the tertial feathers on their wings completely cover their primary flight feathers. It is possible that this character evolved to protect the primaries from the blazing sun, which causes feathers to fade and become brittle [ISBN-13: 978-84-87334-69-6].

David Evans spent time in the advocates' dressing room and managed to trick his way into the cells to visit his \"client\", Terry Moss, a convicted cannabis farmer. Evans was caught out because the presiding judge in the confiscation hearing noticed his outfit was not quite right and his legal submissions were \"hopelessly wrong\". The judge questioned Evans about his legal qualifications and he admitted he had none. During the trial at Bristol crown court it emerged that Evans, 57, from Penarth, south Wales, had previously impersonated a clinical psychologist and had eight consultations with four patients. He was jailed for that deception and met Moss in Dartmoor prison in Devon. Later, when Moss was brought before Plymouth crown court for a proceeds of crime application while serving a sentence for growing \u00a368,000 of cannabis at his Cornish home, Evans appeared to represent him. Evans told the court he was a \"senior advocate\" at a London law firm but the judge, Stephen Wildblood, became suspicious after he made a series of legal blunders. Wildblood told the Bristol court that Evans's appearance struck him immediately as curious. He noticed that Evans appeared to be wearing a solicitor's gown but a barrister's wig. He said: \"Although there may be circumstances in which a solicitor may wear a wig, it struck me immediately as strange. I was surprised to see the confusion of court attire.\" The judge became more concerned having read written submissions from Evans. \"Some of these manifestations were wrong, completely wrong, in an elementary way that worried me,\" he said. \"There were three really fundamental and simple points he was trying to advocate that were hopeless.\" Evans had tried to suggest no confiscation hearing could take place after conviction. \"This is simplistically wrong,\" Wildblood said. \"It is the sort of thing you just look up in a book.\" It was also \"hopelessly wrong\", he said, that Evans had tried to suggest the conviction of Moss was invalid because the plants were not properly defined as cannabis. Wildblood told the jury he adjourned proceedings and made inquiries about Evans both on the internet and by calling the Bar Council and Law Society, but could find no record of him. When the hearing reconvened, he pressed Evans on his legal knowledge. \"I wanted to flush this out,\" he said. \"I asked him to show me where he was taking his law from.\" Asked to produce the references to the laws he was relying on, Evans told the judge he was \"embarrassed\" as he had forgotten his books. He eventually admitted he had no qualifications. Evans was arrested and charged with \"carrying out reserved legal activities when not entitled to\" and \"wilfully pretending to be a person with the right of audience\". He denied both charges but the jury took 30 minutes to convict him. Evans will be sentenced at a later date.",

      "bodyText": "While Joe Anderson has sailed unopposed into the Labour candidacy for Liverpool's elected mayor \u2013 you can read his initial views on the Guardian Northerner here \u2013 things have gone differently in Salford. The long-serving council leader there, John Merry, has been well-beaten for the Labour nomination by the former MP for Eccles, Ian Stewart. Stewart's tally of votes from local party members, announced today, was 259 against Merry's 131, with also-ran Peter Wheeler collecting 89. Stewart tells today's Manchester Evening News, whose article has an interesting and opinionated thread: I'm humbled by the response and the support from within the Labour Party. I really hope that I can represent the aspirations for Salford in the proper way. The people of Salford have demanded change and if I am lucky enough to be elected as the first elected mayor, I will be measured by the new approach that I take \u2013 and effectively the buck will stop with the elected mayor. I won't be able to please everybody all of the time but at least people will have a better understanding as to why decisions are made and of the processes that go into making them. Salford hasn't got over-excited about the coming contest, with under 20 percent of the electorate taking part in a referendum which, as in Liverpool, voted to skip all preliminaries and go for a mayoral vote in May rather than the autumn. But things may well hot up, especially in Salford. The effect on northern media coverage of the BBC's move to Salford is already becoming apparent throughout our three regions. Their impressive array of staff is bound to take a keen interest in an election on the doorstep. Liverpool is always good at news-making too; so the fact that the north has yet to come up with a glitzy challenger \u2013 there was talk of Ryan Giggs in Salford at one time, complete with 'left wing' jokes \u2013 may not send everyone into torpor. Salford's Conservatives have already chosen their council group leader, Karen Garrido, and the Liberal Democrats are still deciding. The Lib Dem candidate for Liverpool's mayoralty, council group leader Richard Kemp, will write in the Guardian Northerner tomorrow.",

I really hope that I can represent the aspirations for Salford in the proper way. The people of Salford have demanded change and if I am lucky enough to be elected as the first elected mayor, I will be measured by the new approach that I take \u2013 and effectively the buck will stop with the elected mayor. </p> <p>I won't be able to please everybody all of the time but at least people will have a better understanding as to why decisions are made and of the processes that go into making them.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386916174\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/16/1324052638479/Eccles-cakes-002.jpg\" alt=\"Eccles cakes\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eccles: world famous for these; and maybe now for providing Salford's favourite as elected mayor.

But things may well hot up, especially in Salford. The effect on northern media coverage of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediacityuk\">BBC's move to Salford</a> is already becoming apparent throughout our three regions. Their impressive array of staff is bound to take a keen interest in an election on the doorstep.</p> <p>Liverpool is always good at news-making too; so the fact that the north has yet to come up with a glitzy challenger \u2013 there was <a href=\"http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/politics/s/1472302_could-salford-go-left-wing-and-vote-for-ryan-giggs-as-mayor\">talk of Ryan Giggs </a>in Salford at one time, complete with 'left wing' jokes \u2013 may not send everyone into torpor.

      "bodyText": "Ofcom has criticised Channel 5's attempt to give fans of Big Brother the chance to be the first to use Facebook to vote, after a server crash meant the system was unavailable during the live final. Channel 5 used the live final on 11 November to debut technology to allow viewers to buy votes using Facebook Credits \u2013 priced at 6.5p each with a minimum purchase of between 65p and \u00a33.26p \u2013 a first for UK television. However, at 9.50pm during the live final, 10 minutes before the close of voting, the Big Brother Facebook app crashed leaving fans unable to cast votes and stuck with credits they had paid for which could not be used. Channel 5 said the service was \"temporarily overloaded due to exceptionally high traffic levels ... and some Facebook users were either unable to vote expediently or at all\". Ofcom was concerned that Channel 5 said it was \"not liable\" for repayment to viewers who had been affected as its terms and conditions stated that a technical failure was not its fault. The media regulator said the terms and conditions do not override the broadcasting code, which \"does not absolve [Channel 5] of its responsibilities to its viewers\". Channel 5 allowed the unregistered Facebook Credits votes to be refunded or used for the more recent Celebrity Big Brother series. In addition Channel 5 said the capacity of its Big Brother Facebook application, run by \"one of Europe's leading managed service providers\", would be increased \"seven fold\" to cope with traffic peaks in the future. Ofcom received seven complaints from viewers about the system and launched an investigation about whether Channel 5 had breached its broadcasting code, which states that the audience must not \"materially mislead [viewers] about any broadcast competition or voting\". The media regulator assessed the voting information and determined that the problems with the service did not affect the overall outcome of the vote, but was nevertheless concerned at the failure. \"Channel 5 is responsible for ensuring that all of its audience voting systems are robust,\" the regulator said. \"Ofcom was therefore concerned that the systems in place were not sufficiently robust to handle the increase in demand.\" Ofcom said Channel 5 \"misled\" viewers as to the time they had to cast their vote \"however unintentional\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Aftermath, for example, has an earthquake that kicks off in the middle of the battle, which destroys some of the walls inside it. Artillery is hit by a tornado, while a stealthy fog creeps into Cover, diminishing the players' vision. In Jacinto and Raven Down, it's raining and snowing respectively.

      "bodyText": "The online grocer Ocado said it had fixed the problems at its Hatfield distribution centre, which is now operating at \"record levels of capacity\", as it reported double-digit growth in sales. Gross sales climbed 10.9% to \u00a3162.1m in the 12 weeks to 19 February, in line with previous guidance of 10% growth and compared with 10.8% in the fourth quarter. Average orders per week increased by 13.4% to 116,987 in the first quarter, although the average order size dropped to \u00a3115.49 from \u00a3118.06. The chief executive, Tim Steiner, said he expected sales growth to pick up further in coming months. \"Evidence suggests we have largely overcome the operational challenges we faced in expanding our Hatfield capacity in the second half of 2011, and are set to meet growing demand through the rest of the year,\" he said. The highest number of orders delivered in a week topped 134,000 at the Hatfield warehouse in Hertfordshire and the company said there were further improvements to come. A planned second warehouse, which is set to open in the Midlands in a year's time at a cost of \u00a3215m, should ease some of its capacity difficulties. Ocado shares, which had already risen 3% on Friday before Monday's trading update, climbed another 2.9%, or 3p, to 106p this morning. The stock has slumped since the company made its market debut at 180p in July 2010. Ocado was founded in 2000 by three former Goldman Sachs bankers and mainly sells products supplied by Waitrose, although it also competes with the upmarket grocer. It has been hit by distribution problems and fears of mounting competition from Waitrose, Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer which are making an online push. Ocado suffered another blow when its finance director quit in January after just 18 months in the job. Morrisons has long been rumoured to be interested in buying Ocado as it beefs up its online presence. The Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan, who has a \"sell\" rating on the shares, said: \"As expected, there are no surprises with first-quarter sales. Moving forward, we expect that the competitive environment will get tougher and that Ocado will struggle to demonstrate operational leverage.\"",

Ocado suffered another blow when its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/23/ocado-finance-director-resigns?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">finance director quit in January</a> after just 18 months in the job. Morrisons has long been rumoured to be interested in buying Ocado as it beefs up its online presence.</p> <p>The Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan, who has a \"sell\" rating on the shares, said: \"As expected, there are no surprises with first-quarter sales. Moving forward, we expect that the competitive environment will get tougher and that Ocado will struggle to demonstrate operational leverage.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Big plans for small people Purni Morell, the new artistic director of London's Unicorn Theatre, caused a bit of a stir in the world of children's theatre at the end of January when she declared: \"I think of the Unicorn as a theatre and not necessarily as a theatre within the children's sector.\" Given that there are many, many theatres, but very few devoted to work for children and young people, it sounded as if children might find that one of the very few spaces they could call their own was being hijacked for a programme with more adult appeal. Not a bit of it. With Morell's first programmed show, a stage version of Eoin Coifer's pirate adventure The Legend of Captain Crow's Teeth, created by Vanishing Point's Matthew Lenton, opening at the end of the month, Morell clarifies over a cup of tea what she meant. \"I do understand the legacy,\" she says, \"but I want to get the Unicorn on the theatre pages of the listings, not just in the kids' sections.\" Does that mean that there will be less work for children? \"No,\" says Morell very firmly, who is very much drawing upon her time as head of the National Theatre Studio with a number of shows that have been in development there, including Mark Arends and Matthew Robins's story of love and loss, Something Very far Away, and new plays for young audiences by rising playwrighting talents, Nancy Harris and Ryan Craig. \"First and foremost, the Unicorn is a theatre, just as the Royal Court is a theatre. It's a theatre that does new writing, and we're a theatre that does work for young people.\" She's right. It's the theatre that should come first, because anything less is selling children short. Theatre for children and young people needs to be taken as seriously and judged on exactly the same criteria as work for adult audiences. A better audience It used to be the case that audiences bought their ticket, sat in the dark quietly and applauded politely at the end. But as the fourth wall has been broken, and the rules of engagement have changed, the role of the audience has changed too. For many theatre-makers, the audience are not passive but real collaborators. Stan's Caf\u00e9's James Yarker talks about being a collaborator with the audience here. But is there actually such a thing as a good and bad audience? In a blog posted over the weekend, Action Hero provides some feedback for audiences about how we can make a difference through our engagement with a show, by being prepared to put in a little work too and really listen and watch. \"Be generous, be open-minded, be prepared to be surprised. Be awake. Be here because you want to be here.\" Above all, the message seems to be: don't worry about what other people are thinking, but trust what you are thinking and feeling. Good advice for any audience. Booing and snoozing Still on the subject of audiences, booing at the ROH made the headlines this week when a staging of Rusalka led to jeers and catcalls. Opera has, of course, always had a tradition of audiences making their displeasure known but over the weekend, some started to wonder whether it should spread to other art forms including theatre. \"Booing,\" suggested Hephzibah Anderson, \"is a sign of direct and passionate engagement that returns us to art's roots.\" Apart from at the panto, I personally think booing is just plain rude in the theatre, and that the actors always deserve applause because however much of a car crash the show is, it is not their fault. In any case, as I often find when at the National Theatre on a Friday or Saturday night, the British public has a much better way of signifying its lack of engagement: as soon as the lights go dark they fall asleep. The better the snooze, the harder they clap at the end. The art of walking I love the sound of Robert Wilson's Walking which takes place in late August on the coast near Holkham as part of the Norwich and Norfolk Festival. (Although the bulk of the festival takes place in May as usual, the Olympics have prompted the organisers to put on a couple of events later in the year.) As Louise Ann Wilson proved last year with Fissure, promenade theatre can be a real hike, not just a pootle. In an Olympic year, Wilson's piece will be less of a 100-metre sprint and more of the three-mile stroll in which audiences will walk at a deliberately slow pace, apparently moderated by guides, so they can experience a series of sound and visual installations. One for the tortoises rather than the mad March hares.",

      "bodyText": "Game Group has continued its recent decline on worries about its future. A number of negative weekend reports about the outlook for the computer games retailer in the wake of last week's news it would not be stocking Mass Effect 3 helped push its shares nearly 7% lower to 4.8p. There has been renewed speculation recently that US rival GameStop might bid, with MCV reporting it was only the store overlap in Australia which was putting the Americans off. An alternative suggestion was that GameStop might be waiting in the wings to see if Game succeeds in finding a way out of its financial difficulties. If not, it could be there to pick up the pieces. Among the major companies, BP bounced 8.1p to 504.6p after its $7.8bn (\u00a35bn) settlement relating to the Gulf of Mexico disaster over the weekend, despite concerns that there were still details of the deal, which involves 110,000 private claims, to be worked out. Analyst Stuart Joyner at Investec said: In perhaps the most positive single development post the Macondo spill, BP agreed a settlement with the plaintiffs' steering committee at the weekend which, at $7.8bn, is below most market estimates, and does not increase the $37.2bn provision. Whilst uncertainty remains, it is diminishing and fast. Our target price [of 595p] includes a pre-tax deduction of $42bn for the net cost of Macondo to BP. But despite BP's gains, the overall market has lost ground again, on worries about a possible Greek default if it does not reach a deal with its private bondholders. News that China has cut its growth targets has also helped send the FTSE 100 down 36.31 points to 5874.82. The Chinese news hit mining shares, given the importance of the country for commodity companies. Kazakhmys, which unveiled disappointing figures last week, was down 48.5p to 951.5p while Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation closed 24p lower at 675p. Glencore fell 16.65p to 403.35p after its in-line figures, while its proposed merger partner Xstrata lost 59p to 1137.5p on disappointment there was no news of better terms for the deal. Serco slipped 33p to 527p after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the outsourcing specialist from buy to neutral, saying the share price was up with events. Essar Energy fell 6.7p to 107.1p ahead of its likely demotion from the FTSE 100, based on Tuesday's nights closing prices. Also expected to depart the leading index are Cairn Energy, down 4.9p at 332p, and Hargreaves Lansdown, 0.2p lower at 445.3p. The biggest riser in the leading index was Intertek, up 58p at \u00a323.72 after the testing company reported a 23% rise in full year profits. Oil services group Petrofac put on 21p to \u00a315.95 following a 25% rise in full year profits and a confident outlook statement. Defensive stocks were back in favour, with GlaxoSmithKline up 14.5p at \u00a314.04 and AstraZeneca adding 23.5p to \u00a328.41. Tesco dipped 1.55p to 316.7p despite unveiling plans to create 20,000 jobs over the next two years. Fitch said the move should lure back some customers although Tesco would have to keep adjusting prices to keep its market share close to current levels. Among the mid-caps Dunelm, the homewares retailer, fell sharply after news that former chief executive Will Adderley and his wife had cashed in around \u00a336m worth of shares in the business. Adderley, the son of the company's founder who remains executive deputy chairman, and his wife sold 7.5m shares in a placing managed by UBS. The shares represent around 2.5% of Dunelm's share capital. Adderley told the company the move was to diversify his share portfolio, and he agreed not to sell more shares for at least six months. His remaining stake gives him around 32.4% of the company, while the Adderley family in total retain 56.2%. Dunelm dropped 25.7p to 482.8p. Lower down the market GCM Resources rose 7.63p to 89p on talk of an imminent deal. Finally Energetix added 1.75p to 27.5p after ScottishPower agreed to trial the company's combined heat and power boilers. Energetix claims the boilers can reduce fuel bills and provide income for the customer since they generate electricity which can be sold back to the grid.",

Funnily enough, this got a lot of people very very excited, the song hitting nearly 40,000 plays in under nine hours. Nova is the third time the pair have collaborated following their 2009 12in Moth/Wolf Club and last year's split 12in with Thom Yorke, Ego/Mirror. As with those tracks, Nova is a typically dense and warm-sounding sonic experiment that floats in on a bed of gurgling vocal samples and rippling atmospherics before a keyboard riff emerges after 90 seconds. For the rest of the song that riff and the distant vocal snippets interact to create something beautiful, compelling and perfect for a Monday.",

Funnily enough, this got a lot of people very very excited, the song hitting nearly 40,000 plays in under nine hours. Nova is the third time the pair have collaborated following their 2009 12in Moth/Wolf Club and last year's split 12in with Thom Yorke, Ego/Mirror. As with those tracks, Nova is a typically dense and warm-sounding sonic experiment that floats in on a bed of gurgling vocal samples and rippling atmospherics before a keyboard riff emerges after 90 seconds. For the rest of the song that riff and the distant vocal snippets interact to create something beautiful, compelling and perfect for a Monday.</p>",

He measured the parts, then published the copious details, and sometimes pictures, for all to see. Bean worked at the University of Michigan, then at the Philippine Medical School, then at Tulane University, and finally at the University of Virginia. One of his first published papers, in 1907, was A Preliminary Report on the Measurements of about 1,000 Students at Ann Arbor, Michigan. After that, he turned more specific, looking at this or that particular organ, limb, or bodily region. Bean measured lots of innards. In Some Racial Characteristics of the Spleen Weight in Man, he wrote: \"The white male spleen weighs about 140 grams, the negro male 115 grams, the white female 130 grams and the negro female 80 grams.\" Numbers abound also in his Some Racial Characteristics of the Liver Weight in Man, and Some Racial Characteristics of the Weight of the Heart and Kidneys. He occasionally looked at the entire person, as in Notes on the Hairy Men of the Philippine Islands and Elsewhere. Most often, though, he did piece work. In Sitting Height and Leg Length in Old Virginians, he instructed: \"The sitting height, leg length, and sitting height index of several groups of Old Virginians is of some interest.\" Bean's treatise on ears is divided into two parts: \"Ears of the morgue subjects\" and \"Ears of the living subjects\". He published Note on the Head Form of 435 American Soldiers with Special Reference to Flattening in the Occipital Region, and also Three Forms of the Human Nose. Sometimes he was very specific: The Nose of the Jew and the Quadratus Labii Superioris [a facial muscle]. In Some Useful Morphologic Factors in Racial Anatomy, Bean introduced the omphalic index, a new metric about the belly button. One obtains it by making two measurements and a calculation: \"The distance of the umbilicus from the symphysis pubis is divided by the distance of the umbilicus from the suprasternal notch.\" By the time Bean died in 1944, he had recorded measurements of more partial people than almost any other man who ever lived. This was, obviously, not the same Dr Bennett Bean who, in 1980, published the study (described previously in this column) Nail Growth: Thirty-Five Years of Observation. That was Robert Bennett Bean's son, William Bennett Bean, whose measurements were circumscribed, focusing exclusively on what he found at the ends of his own fingers. \u2022 Marc Abrahams is organiser of the Ig Nobel prizes.

Haarde was PM of Iceland during and leading up to its economic meltdown in 2008, and is the first national leader to face charges over the global financial crisis. Watching Haarde enter the Culture House, the trial venue, brought back awful memories of October 2008 when our economy imploded, and the nation was thrust into a state of shock, fear and anger. Yet this trial is necessary. The Icelandic collapse was not just an economic collapse \u2013 it was also a moral collapse. It was a collapse of the people's trust in its country's politicians, institutions and financial system. It revealed to the vast majority of us that we'd had no idea of the extent of the political corruption and neglect that had lurked beneath the surface of our society for decades. This trial is not about Haarde. It is not about sending him to jail, or making sure he gets his comeuppance. In fact, most analysts believe that he will beat the charges against him; that one man cannot be held accountable for what went wrong in the years leading up to the meltdown. No, this trial is about transparency and democracy. It is about the right of the people to hear from their highest elected representative about what really happened in the months and years leading up to the greatest man-made disaster this country has known. Bringing Haarde to trial has not been easy. He has called the charges against him \"preposterous\" and says he is the victim of political persecution. His political associates, mostly from inside Iceland's powerful Independence party, have tirelessly campaigned to have the charges dismissed. It has been an intense political and ideological struggle, played out both within the confines of Althingi, Iceland's parliament, and in the minds and hearts of the Icelandic people. Iceland is a small society, and it is often difficult to separate the individual from the issue. In a nation of 320,000 people, it can feel a bit like you're sending your uncle to trial, and this complicates the matter for many of us. Moreover, there has been much debate about the fairness of holding one man accountable not just for his own mistakes, but also for the mistakes of others. But that is not the issue. We want to know what happened. A vast amount of information and data has been collected and analysed for this trial. That information contains answers to many of the burning questions that the Icelandic people need the answers to if we are to put the shock and trauma of the economic collapse behind us. At the beginning of the year, the current leader of the Independence party introduced a motion in parliament to have the charges against Haarde dismissed. Late last week, lawmakers voted by a narrow margin to press ahead with the trial. Had the vote gone the other way, the information and documents that will presumably surface during the trial might have been closed to the Icelandic people for decades to come. Indeed, the Independence party's vehement opposition to the trial did nothing but raise suspicion that there was something in those documents that the power elite wanted to keep hidden. With any luck, that suspicion will be eliminated. Haarde's trial is a victory for transparency and democracy \u2013 those ideological concepts that are sweeping the world on the back of movements like the Arab spring and Occupy. His guilt or innocence is not the primary issue; his trial is a stepping-stone to a more open and just society. As to whether other nations should follow Iceland's example, I can only respond with a resounding yes. Let transparency, justice and truth guide the way to a new world order. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012.

      "bodyText": "The Germany manager Joachim L\u00f6w had a number of interesting games to chose from this weekend. But he decided to attend SC Freiburg's 2-1 win over Schalke on Saturday. The 52-year-old prefers to watch games in his adopted home town, to be sure, but choosing a game that featured only one his Euro 2012 hopefuls (Benedikt H\u00f6wedes) \u2013 bar a surprise return of the goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand to the fold \u2013 was still a little puzzling in the light of other, more high-class fare on offer. Maybe L\u00f6w simply hadn't been told in time that the S04' Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar wouldn't be able to play after knocking heads with Chris Smalling at Wembley. He wanted to view more matches featuring opposition players, he said following Germany's 2-1 defeat to the French in midweek. Or perhaps L\u00f6w is so assured about the capabilities of his squad that he doesn't really need to watch any more games professionally at all before June. And why, indeed, bother? On the evidence of match day 24, the Germany team will not only enjoy the usual benefit of a Bundesliga winter-break but the highly unusual and somewhat controversial decision by the top clubs to stop playing two months earlier than normal. The DFL will do its best to deny this publicly this but you've read it here first: the season is finished. All results must be void and there will be no champion. Sorry. The aftermath of the matches involving the so-called Fantastischen Vier, three-quarters of which were only fantastically inept to keep pace with the league leaders Dortmund, make this dramatic move necessary, unfortunately. All four clubs at the top have now declared themselves firmly not interested in winning the title, a lack of ambition so complete that it's surely unparalleled in 49 years of Bundesliga football. You often read about leagues where nobody wants to win it, but that's usually understood as a sarky reference to inconsistency not an actual absence of motivation. In this case, they really seem to mean it though. And if the teams involved don't feel it's worth it, why should we? A competition that no one wants to win stops being a competition altogether before long. So let's stop now, before the Meisterschaft suffers the fate of the European Cup Winners' Cup. Maybe those threatened with relegation can still continue in a mini league, or the second division can fill the gap in the TV schedules until L\u00f6w's young pretenders to Spain's throne get going. The fingers of blame for this sad state of affairs must naturally point at Bayern Munich. The Bavarians, busy talking up their own credentials only a couple of months ago \u2013 \"we will always have better potential than Dortmund,\" said Bastian Schweinsteiger \u2013 have acted out the lonely role of perennial loudmouths with admirable persuasion in recent decades but now seem tired of their own claims. They threw in the towel after the 2-0 defeat at Leverkusen, even before BVB extended their lead to seven points in the evening kick-off against Mainz. \"There is no need to talk about the championship anymore,\" said the sporting director Christian Nerlinger, a study in barely repressed anger and desperation. \"We need to look behind us,\" added the midfielder Toni Kroos. \"Coming second is our priority.\" A disastrous run that has yielded a mere 11 points in seven games in 2012 makes that kind humility advisable, but writing off a trophy this early is still unprecedented as far as the brash southerners are concerned. \"A few weeks ago, all of this seemed about as realistic as barbecue freak Uli Hoeness giving up on grilled sausages for life,\" mused S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. The irony of this capitulation is that Bayern weren't quite as pants on the Franck Rib\u00e9ry underwear scale as in earlier defeats this side of the winter break. You could say that Jupp Heynckes's men had actually played half-decently in the first half. But the by now familiar combination of woeful finishing, lack of composure in midfield, playing with one man down \u2013 Mario Gomez has only existed as an abstract concept on the team sheet in recent weeks \u2013 as well as Manuel Neuer's third high-profile mistake this season enabled Leverkusen to chalk up their third win on the trot with two late goals: Stefan Kiessling on 79 minutes, Karim Bellarabi on 90. The next few weeks will be more about Heynckes's future \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 than trophies. \"There will be talks with the manager, at the right time,\" Nerlinger declared ominously. Bayern, however, are not the sole culprits for this premature end to the title race. Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, 1-0 losers away to N\u00fcrnberg in a game where Lucien Favre's cautious approach back-fired, and Schalke were never serious contenders to begin with, so their refusal to engage in championship talk is understandable. The same cannot be said about Dortmund though. To be fair, their 2-1 win over Mainz, a team that gave the Black &amp; Yellows a taste of their own pressing medicine, was brilliant in many ways. Dortmund wasted quite a few chances but played with the kind of inevitable, devastating urgency that no other side can muster at the moment. Eight wins on the trot, no defeats in 18, and no one in sight to stop them: they're in a class of their own, once again. There's only one thing that rankles. It rankles a lot, actually. Neutral observers live in constant fear of their unspeakably awful post-match interviews. J\u00fcrgen Klopp's wide-eyed insistence that he's not in the slightest bit concerned with winning the league stopped being charming and self-deprecating approximately 18 months ago, yet the 44-year-old persists with this tiresome routine like a stand-up comedian stuck on the same half-funny line on stage. \"I haven't thought about it at all, why should I?\" he asked rhetorically on Saturday. \"I'm telling you the truth, it really doesn't concern me.\" Then there's midfielder Kevin Gro\u00dfkreutz, a player who's always available for interviews but never says anything substantial at all. He sneeringly chides his interlocutors for asking the very same question every week (\"Do you want to win the championship?\") without being the least bit aware of his own part in this piece of absurd theatre. As much as one can understand why Dortmund would be sticking to their PR strategy of last season, their over-the-top kookiness is annoying, frankly. The DFL is surely fed-up, too: it reflects badly on the brand if the best side in the country proclaim themselves constantly unfussed about winning the Schale (championship bowl). Just to call Klopp's bluff, it should wind up the season now and declare that there will no winner. Or perhaps it could just hand out the trophy randomly, to anyone of the clubs who confirm in writing that they would like to have it. Maybe L\u00f6w can even swing it to so that Freiburg get it. Talking points \u2022 Sometimes, a mere red card is not enough. The Hamburg striker Paolo Guerrero will be lucky to escape an eight-game ban for a foul that was described as \"insane\" by J\u00fcrgen Klopp: the Peruvian took a run-up of 50m, then jumped feet first into the legs of the Stuttgart keeper Sven Ulreich, who was innocently shepherding the ball out of play near the corner flag. Guerrero's best puppy dog eyes and \"what I did do?\" gestures failed to persuade the referee Peter Sippel. The Swabians, already 3-0 up at the time, added a fourth through Martin Harnik in the 90the minute to make it a triumphant return for the coach Bruno Labbadia. Hamburg's \"transitional\" season looks little more daunting now. \u2022 Kaiserslautern fought tooth and nail but came away with only a goalless draw against Felix Magath's Wolfsburg. The manner of the passionate performance was sufficient to keep their coach Marco Kurz in the job a little longer and the supporters apologised to the Israeli striker Itay Shechter for last week's anti-semitic insults with banners and applause. What seemed like a decent afternoon turned quite sour, however, when the Red Devils' rivals all picked up points. \u2022 Hertha won their first game since October to escape the relegation zone. Against their manager's former team Werder Bremen, Otto Rehhagel's men showed a bit of grit and application \u2013 enough to put paid to the visitors' recent revival. A slightly mishit volley from Nikita Rukavytsya secured all three points but as anticipated, Rehhagel's post-match press conference provided more entertainment. The veteran coach held court, merrily quoting German philosophers \u2013 including his wife Beate \u2013 and deepened his friendship with Voice, the guide dog of a blind journalist. He also joked that he didn't know how to pronounce some of his players' names. \"I call him Paradise,\" he said about Fanol Perdedaj, before going out to dine with the German foreign secretary. Guido Westerwelle will have been very pleased Otto found space in the diary for him.

      "body": "<p>The Germany manager Joachim L\u00f6w had a number of interesting games to chose from this weekend. But he decided to attend SC Freiburg's 2-1 win over Schalke on Saturday. The 52-year-old prefers to watch games in his adopted home town, to be sure, but choosing a game that featured only one his Euro 2012 hopefuls (Benedikt H\u00f6wedes) \u2013 bar a surprise return of the goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand to the fold \u2013 was still a little puzzling in the light of other, more high-class fare on offer.</p> <p>Maybe L\u00f6w simply hadn't been told in time that the S04' Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar wouldn't be able to play after knocking heads with Chris Smalling at Wembley. He wanted to view more matches featuring opposition players, he said following Germany's 2-1 defeat to the French in midweek. Or perhaps L\u00f6w is so assured about the capabilities of his squad that he doesn't really need to watch any more games professionally at all before June. And why, indeed, bother? On the evidence of match day 24, the Germany team will not only enjoy the usual benefit of a Bundesliga winter-break but the highly unusual and somewhat controversial decision by the top clubs to stop playing two months earlier than normal. The DFL will do its best to deny this publicly this but you've read it here first: the season is finished. All results must be void and there will be no champion. Sorry.</p> <p>The aftermath of the matches involving the so-called Fantastischen Vier, three-quarters of which were only fantastically inept to keep pace with the league leaders Dortmund, make this dramatic move necessary, unfortunately. All four clubs at the top have now declared themselves firmly not interested in winning the title, a lack of ambition so complete that it's surely unparalleled in 49 years of Bundesliga football. You often read about leagues where nobody wants to win it, but that's usually understood as a sarky reference to inconsistency not an actual absence of motivation. In this case, they really seem to mean it though. And if the teams involved don't feel it's worth it, why should we? A competition that no one wants to win stops being a competition altogether before long. So let's stop now, before the Meisterschaft suffers the fate of the European Cup Winners' Cup.</p> <p>Maybe those threatened with relegation can still continue in a mini league, or the second division can fill the gap in the TV schedules until L\u00f6w's young pretenders to Spain's throne get going.</p> <p>The fingers of blame for this sad state of affairs must naturally point at Bayern Munich.

      "bodyText": "An inquest has been opened into the death of a man shot dead in a village car park in Culcheth, Cheshire, at the weekend. Anthony Grainger, 35, from Bolton, died of a single gunshot wound to the chest after police stopped the vehicle he was in at about 7.20pm on Saturday in what has been described as a pre-planned operation. The inquest, which is being held at Warrington coroners court, heard that Grainger worked as an odd-job man. Meanwhile, three men have appeared in court charged with conspiracy to commit robbery between 24 January and 3 March. David Totton, 33, and Robert Rimmer, 26, both from Manchester, and Joseph Travers, 27, of no fixed address, stood together in the dock for a short hearing at Manchester magistrates court. Two of the men were arrested in Culcheth on Saturday night and a third was arrested in Manchester on Sunday. They were all remanded to appear at Manchester crown court later this month. Greater Manchester police's pre-planned operation is thought to have been connected to a violent robbery two weeks ago in which a thief wearing a balaclava is alleged to have punched one shopkeeper in the face and threatened others with a machete. After Grainger was shot on Saturday night, officers from the force's specialist operations branch performed first aid but could not save his life. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the incident. An IPCC spokesman said: \"The independent investigation will consider the actions of all the officers at the scene, as well as the planning, decision-making and implementation of the operation which led to the death.\" It emerged that Grainger had been a defendant in a multimillion-pound drugs trial that led to a juror being jailed for contempt of court. Joanne Fraill, 40, was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment last year after she admitted exchanging online messages with Grainger's co-defendant Jamie Sewart, 34, who had already been acquitted, in August 2010. Grainger was later cleared of conspiracy to supply drugs but had already admitted handling stolen cars in connection with the case and was jailed for 20 months. Tributes to him have been left on Facebook. One read: \"I love you Anthony, you are the one who will be in my heart forever, my fella, my best friend, my soul mate.\" The message ended: \"Hope you sleep well xxxx all my love Gail x\" The shooting has shocked residents of Culcheth, which sits between Liverpool and Manchester. Some people had to be shepherded to safety on Saturday night and compared the scenes to \"something off a film\". Jessica Brown, 15, who was with friends in the Village Pizza takeaway, said: \"When we came outside there was gas in the air, you could smell it. I then saw a black van with three or four people inside drive towards the car park. One of them was leaning outside the window and I later heard shots.\" Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, of Greater Manchester police, said specially trained family liaison officers were in contact with the man's family, and said his force, Cheshire police and the IPCC would carry out a thorough investigation. Nicholas Rheinberg, the coroner for Cheshire, adjourned the inquest pending the findings of the IPCC investigation. James Donaghy, deputy senior investigator for the IPCC, told the coroner that he expected it to be a protracted investigation owing to the \"significant number of police officers\" it would need to consult.",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury must square a circle if it is to continue with its controversial plans to cut child benefit for higher earners and prevent a backbench rebellion. The current plan, to cut child benefit for households that include one higher-rate taxpayer, has three major problems. First, it disadvantages single-income homes \u2013 a couple could jointly earn \u00a380,000 and still receive child benefit while their neighbour, a lone parent on \u00a343,000 a year, would lose it. Second, it creates a \"cliff edge\" effect whereby there is a dramatic financial penalty when people move up a tax bracket, losing child benefit at the same point that their tax rate doubles. One reader of the Guardian's Reality check blogpost said they would bump up their pension contributions to remain a basic-rate taxpayer. The Treasury acknowledges it would lose 15% of the savings to fraud and legal systems of avoidance. Finally, there are huge bureaucratic burdens. The tax system, based on individuals, would have to devise a way to assess the income of a household. No 10 has now said that it will deal with these \"unintended consequences\". But the suggestions over the weekend, including simply raising the threshold to \u00a350,000 or \u00a380,000, fail to resolve the main stumbling blocks. There is one simple solution: the Institute for Fiscal Studies has argued that the government could top up tax credits to the tune of child benefit and taper it at the upper end to achieve the same \u00a32.4bn savings. When the universal credit is introduced, this could be even more straightforward. In fact, the IFS says, it could easily achieve up to \u00a35bn. Although this option solves the fairness and practical issues, it would also mean that child benefit would no longer be a distinct payment. If ministers are beginning to learn how attached people are to child benefit, merging it with other benefits would certainly be a step too far. Mike Brewer, author of the IFS research, said: \"This is about the politics versus the sensible design of giving the right money to the right people. The government already has a way to assess joint incomes through tax credits.\"",

      "body": "<p>The Treasury must square a circle if it is to continue with its controversial plans to cut child benefit for higher earners and prevent a backbench rebellion.</p> <p>The current plan, to cut child benefit for households that include one higher-rate taxpayer, has three major problems. First, it disadvantages single-income homes \u2013 a couple could jointly earn \u00a380,000 and still receive child benefit while their neighbour, a lone parent on \u00a343,000 a year, would lose it.</p> <p>Second, it creates a \"cliff edge\" effect whereby there is a dramatic financial penalty when people move up a tax bracket, losing child benefit at the same point that their tax rate doubles. One reader of the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/05/child-benefit-cut-options\" title=\"\">Reality check blogpost</a> said they would bump up their pension contributions to remain a basic-rate taxpayer. The Treasury acknowledges it would lose 15% of the savings to fraud and legal systems of avoidance.</p> <p>Finally, there are huge bureaucratic burdens. The tax system, based on individuals, would have to devise a way to assess the income of a household.</p> <p>No 10 has now said that it will deal with these \"unintended consequences\". But the suggestions over the weekend, including simply raising the threshold to \u00a350,000 or \u00a380,000, fail to resolve the main stumbling blocks.</p> <p>There is one simple solution: the Institute for Fiscal Studies has argued that the government could top up tax credits to the tune of child benefit and taper it at the upper end to achieve the same \u00a32.4bn savings. When the universal credit is introduced, this could be even more straightforward. In fact, the IFS says, it could easily achieve up to \u00a35bn.</p> <p>Although this option solves the fairness and practical issues, it would also mean that child benefit would no longer be a distinct payment. If ministers are beginning to learn how attached people are to child benefit, merging it with other benefits would certainly be a step too far.</p> <p>Mike Brewer, author of the IFS research, said: \"This is about the politics versus the sensible design of giving the right money to the right people. The government already has a way to assess joint incomes through tax credits.\"</p>",

A harmless enough venture, you might think. Meant to be a bit shocking, perhaps. Well, it is indeed shocking, but not in the way you might expect. When it comes to hardcore debauchery, a surprising degree of restraint is observed. There's little in the way of sex in Project X, let alone orgiastic abandon. Body fluids are hardly in evidence; Bridesmaids made a much better fist of defecation and projectile vomiting. Signs warn party-goers that nudity is compulsory, yet the girls are allowed to keep their knickers on. What is, however, startling is the nastiness of the attitudes in play. (Spoilers ahead.) The boys refer to their female classmates as \"hos\" and \"bitches\" and seek their company only as masturbatory aids. The girls eagerly endorse their own abuse. They're all good looking, but that may be because the invite included the injunction: \"Ugly bitches stay home.\" A dwarf gets locked in the oven, while a pet dog is tied to helium balloons and sent aloft. A neighbour who complains about the noise is simply Tasered. The proceedings are oddly joyless. There's none of the charm, warmth, wit or remorse to be found in other party films. The drug-fuelled revelry seems desperate rather than rapturous. Thomas, the 17-year-old host, isn't really staging the event to celebrate his birthday or even to have fun; he is out to persuade his schoolmates that he's cool, and therefore merits pussy. The suffering inflicted in the process, both on his own family and the entire neighbourhood, is acceptable collateral damage. All that matters is the grim pursuit of personal advantage. It works. The mayhem that Thomas precipitates earns him the respect he craves. His college fund will have to be spent on rebuilding the family home, and the law is on his tail. No matter: at school he is now a superhero. So he gets the girl he wants, reassuring her that he doesn't care about having bankrupted his parents because he cares about her instead. It's not only Thomas's peer group that applauds him. He wins the attention of the media, and with it celebrity status. Before the party, his dad declared him \"a loser\". As that same dad surveys the wreckage of his family's life, he ventures wonderingly: \"I didn't know you had it in you.\" You can't say this film lacks a moral. If you're young, you're entitled. So just do what it takes to get what you want. Whatever price you and others have to pay, it will be worth it. In the end, everyone will approve, including the grownups. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Warner Bros. Hollywood is terrified that it is losing its grip on the young male audience on which its success has depended for so long. Project X could be interpreted as a fantasy concocted to appease a generation mistakenly feared by ageing film-makers. Yet the film's producer, Todd Phillips, declares: \"The whole movie really rests on authenticity.\" Might it contain an element of truth? Project X is reported to have been inspired by the story of Corey Delaney, a 16-year-old in Melbourne who held a party in his parents' house after announcing it on MySpace. Five hundred people turned up, and clashes with police broke out. Like Thomas, Delaney became a media star. Teen parties have wrecked homes in Britain as well. Last year a 15-year-old died at one. Young people have always sought out festivals of misrule, but the out-of-control teenage house-party is a product of our age. It's not just that smartphones and social media have made it easier for gatecrashers to mobilise. The relationship between adolescents and their parents has also changed. Teenagers want more and expect to get it. In the past, parents might have resisted misplaced demands, but many have lost the confidence to do so. They want to be liked, not respected, and their authority has therefore waned. Ordered out of the house because their children want to party, they may meekly acquiesce. When it comes to partying, as in other fields, the young are allowed more autonomy; but are given less guidance on how they should exercise it. Like Thomas, they fall prey to the apparent imperatives of the moment. It's their parents' job to set them straight. Like Thomas's dad, they often don't. Life isn't yet a wild party that applauds those who pursue their desires at everyone else's expense. Project X may be warning us that it is heading that way. At the screening I attended, young film-goers whooped excitedly at the dismal shenanigans depicted. Fair enough. Less heartening were the apparent beams of approval from the older people among them. Presumably, they wanted to get down with the kids. But when it's bad down there, the kids need us to drag them out of it, not to provide them with our blessing. You can't blame Thomas.

      "bodyText": "Republicans and their Tea Party shock troops say they want to \"take America back\". Progressives think they mean back to the 1950s, back to when men were men, women were ladies, and black folks only got into the White House by the back door. But Republicans are thinking big: they actually want to take us back to the Middle Ages, back to the \"good old days\" of sexual repression, regulation and punishment. Forget the economy: this election is becoming a referendum on women's bodies, since it's women (according to the Republicans' Book of Holy Misogyny) who like to have sex without wanting to get pregnant, and, if they do get pregnant, might want to have an abortion; women who demand, as former Senator Rick Santorum says, a \"license to do things in the sexual realm that is [sic] counter to how things are supposed to be.\" You know, \"sluts\". Republicans in Congress have launched a dubious investigation of Planned Parenthood, the century-old women's health organization, and tried to take away its funding. The Senate narrowly defeated an amendment that would have allowed employers to deny insurance coverage for anything the employer found morally or religiously objectionable: contraception, certainly, but perhaps also lung cancer treatment (\"you should have stopped smoking\"), HIV/Aids testing (\"homosexuality is an abomination\"), and pre-natal care for single women (\"nice girls get themselves a husband before they get themselves a baby\"). With the notable exception of Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, a moderate who announced last week that she'd had enough of the ugliness and would not seek re-election, the Republican party has regressed to a pre-modern state, making war on any woman who, to borrow Rebecca West's words, \"expresses any sentiment that might differentiate her from a doormat or a prostitute\". Just the other week, an Indiana legislator pitched a hissy fit over the girl scouts, the US version of the girl guides, accusing them of promoting lesbianism and feminism and, worst of all, working hand in glove with Planned Parenthood. Republicans aren't bothering to be subtle. A couple of weeks ago, California Representative Darrell Issa convened an all-male panel on birth control. He claimed that the issue was not women's health, but \"religious freedom\" (Representative Nancy Pelosi sighed:\"I may at some point be moved to explain biology to my colleagues\"). Therefore, he refused to allow Sandra Fluke, a young law student and an admitted female, to speak (pdf). Democrats later held their own hearing at which Fluke testified that while Georgetown, the Roman Catholic-run university she attends, provides some health insurance, it does not include contraception \u2013 and the pill can cost $1,000 per year. Women take contraception for a variety of medical reasons, not only to prevent pregnancy: Fluke recounted the story of a friend, a fellow student, who needed the pill to treat cysts. She couldn't afford it, got sick and had to have an ovary removed. Fluke's reward for speaking truth to power? A public trashing. Rush Limbaugh \u2013 if not the de facto leader of the Republican party, then surely the clearest expression of its \"id\" \u2013 called her a prostitute and demanded that she post video of her sexual encounters on the internet. After several days of outrage and the loss of some important advertisers on his radio show, Limbaugh issued something approximating an apology. But the conservative blogosphere, the radio provocateurs and Fox News continue to attack Fluke as a Democratic \"plant\", a \"FemiNazi\" activist, and, of course, a harlot. Republican presidential candidates have not exactly covered themselves in glory, either, on Fluke. Indeed, they don't seem to realise that women actually vote. Frontrunner Mitt Romney said mildly of Limbaugh's insults, \"it's not the language I would have used.\" Newt Gingrich (whose wife Callista said she was \"giving up opinions\" for Lent) blamed \"the media\" for exploiting the story and said there were far more important issues \u2013 Barack Obama's \"war on religion\", for example. As for Rick Santorum, the holier-than-everybody \u00fcber-Catholic who thinks contraception is \"dangerous\" and leads to \"libertinism\", the most outrage he could manage on Fluke's behalf was to call Limbaugh's comments \"absurd\", the licensed remarks of an \"entertainer\". Along with Gingrich, Santorum supports \"personhood\" amendments, laws decreeing that a fertilized egg has the same rights under the United States constitution as those of us who happen to live outside the womb. Romney, Gingrich and Santorum all oppose the Obama administration's mandate that employers (except actual churches) cover contraception, but Santorum burns with a special zealotry. It's as if he's channeling one of those early Church Fathers who went overboard trying to justify celibacy: Tertullian, maybe, who said a woman was \"a temple built over a sewer\". Purity solves everything: remember, Santorum's millionaire supporter Foster Friess recommended women use aspirin to keep from getting pregnant: \"The gals put it between their knees.\" The charitable view says he thinks he was attempting humor; but he wasn't joking about the regressive values. Santorum's vision of America is a hybrid Puritan and Catholic theocracy. He constantly rants against Obama's promotion of \"secularism\", and says the idea of an \"absolute\" separation of church and state makes him want to throw up. He should try being pregnant.

One of the lead plaintiffs in the suit, Ave Maria University, is Santorum's kind of place. Built by Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan on the edge of a Florida swamp, and now run by George W Bush's former director of faith-based initiatives, the university insists that students \"dress modestly\" and pretty much refrain from doing anything that could be construed as fun. In 2008, when Obama was running for his first term, Santorum gave a speech at Ave Maria in which he warned that Satan was gunning for the \"good, decent, powerful, influential\" America \u2013 indeed, that the US is engaged in a \"spiritual war\". And what's that war about? Abortion, of course. Blame it on Eve, blame it on the deadly sin of luxuria. It all comes down to women's bodies, which are, as Tertullian reminds us, \"the devil's doorway\".",

      "body": "<p>Republicans and their Tea Party shock troops say they want to \"take America back\". Progressives think they mean back to the 1950s, back to when men were men, women were ladies, and black folks only got into the White House by the back door. But Republicans are thinking big: they actually want to take us back to the Middle Ages, back to the \"good old days\" of sexual repression, regulation and punishment.</p> <p>Forget the economy: this election is becoming a referendum on women's bodies, since it's women (according to the Republicans' Book of Holy Misogyny) who like to have sex without wanting to get pregnant, and, if they do get pregnant, might want to have an abortion; women who demand, as former Senator Rick Santorum says, a \"license to do <a href=\"http://www.gop12.thehill.com/2012/02/santorum-slammed-contraception-for.html\">things in the sexual realm</a> that is [sic] counter to how things are supposed to be.\"</p> <p>You know, <a href=\"http://www.thinkprogress.org/media/2012/02/29/435082/limbaugh-calls-student-denied-spot-at-contraception-hearing-a-slut/\">\"sluts\"</a>.</p> <p>Republicans in Congress <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/meet-the-man-behind-susan-g-komens-decision-to-stiff-planned-parenthood/252469/\">have launched a dubious investigation of Planned Parenthood</a>, the century-old women's health organization, and tried to take away its funding. The Senate narrowly defeated an amendment that would have allowed employers to deny insurance coverage for anything the employer found morally or religiously objectionable: contraception, certainly, but perhaps also lung cancer treatment (\"you should have stopped smoking\"), HIV/Aids testing (\"homosexuality is an abomination\"), and pre-natal care for single women (\"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/28/christa-dias-fired-artificial-insemination-catholic_n_1173139.html\">nice girls get themselves a husband before they get themselves a baby</a>\").</p> <p>With the notable exception of <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/maine-sen-olympia-snowe-to-retire/\">Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, a moderate who announced last week that she'd had enough of the ugliness</a> and would not seek re-election, the Republican party has regressed to a pre-modern state, making war on any woman who, to borrow <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_West\">Rebecca West's words</a>, \"expresses any sentiment that might differentiate her from a doormat or a prostitute\". Just the other week, an Indiana legislator pitched a hissy fit over the girl scouts, the US version of the girl guides, <a href=\"http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/1-lawmaker-who-wrote-girl-scouts-are-feminists-lesbians-or-communists-is-really-sorry-you-rea\">accusing them of promoting lesbianism and feminism</a> and, worst of all, working hand in glove with Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>Republicans aren't bothering to be subtle. A couple of weeks ago, California Representative Darrell Issa convened an all-male panel on birth control. He claimed that the issue was not women's health, but \"religious freedom\" (Representative Nancy Pelosi sighed:\"I may at some point be moved to explain biology to my colleagues\"). Therefore, <a href=\"http://www.abcnews.go.co/images/Politics/statement-Congress-letterhead-2nd%20hearing.pdf\">he refused to allow Sandra Fluke, a young law student and an admitted female, to speak (pdf)</a>.</p> <p>Democrats later held their own hearing at which Fluke testified that while Georgetown, the Roman Catholic-run university she attends, provides some health insurance, it does not include contraception \u2013 and the pill can cost $1,000 per year. Women take contraception for a variety of medical reasons, not only to prevent pregnancy: Fluke recounted the story of a friend, a fellow student, who needed the pill to treat cysts. She couldn't afford it, got sick and had to have an ovary removed. </p> <p>Fluke's reward for speaking truth to power? A public trashing. Rush Limbaugh \u2013 if not the de facto leader of the Republican party, then surely the clearest expression of its \"id\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/02/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke-slander\">called her a prostitute and demanded that she post video of her sexual encounters on the internet</a>. After several days of outrage and the loss of some important advertisers on his radio show, Limbaugh issued something approximating an apology. But the conservative blogosphere, the radio provocateurs and Fox News continue to attack Fluke as a Democratic \"plant\", a \"FemiNazi\" activist, and, of course, a harlot. </p> <p>Republican presidential candidates have not exactly covered themselves in glory, either, on Fluke. Indeed, they don't seem to realise that women actually vote. Frontrunner Mitt Romney said mildly of Limbaugh's insults, \"it's not the language I would have used.\" Newt Gingrich (whose wife Callista said she was \"giving up opinions\" for Lent) blamed \"the media\" for exploiting the story and said there were far more important issues \u2013 Barack Obama's \"war on religion\", for example.</p> <p>As for Rick Santorum, the holier-than-everybody \u00fcber-Catholic who thinks contraception is \"dangerous\" and leads to \"libertinism\", the most outrage he could manage on Fluke's behalf was to call Limbaugh's comments \"absurd\", the licensed remarks of an \"entertainer\". Along with Gingrich, Santorum supports <a href=\"http://www.msmagazine.com/news/uswirestory.asp?ID=13456\">\"personhood\" amendments</a>, laws decreeing that a fertilized egg has the same rights under the United States constitution as those of us who happen to live outside the womb.</p> <p>Romney, Gingrich and Santorum all oppose the Obama administration's mandate that employers (except actual churches) cover contraception, but Santorum burns with a special zealotry. It's as if he's channeling one of those early Church Fathers who went overboard trying to justify celibacy: Tertullian, maybe, who said a woman was \"a temple built over a sewer\". Purity solves everything: remember, Santorum's millionaire supporter <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foster-friess-aspirin-joke-shows-danger-to-candidates-of-outside-political-groups/2012/02/17/gI\">Foster Friess recommended women use aspirin</a> to keep from getting pregnant: \"The gals put it between their knees.\" The charitable view says he thinks he was attempting humor; but he wasn't joking about the regressive values.</p> <p>Santorum's vision of America is a hybrid Puritan and Catholic theocracy. He constantly rants against Obama's promotion of \"secularism\", and says the idea of an \"absolute\" separation of church and state <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/feb29/separation-church-state-american-myth\">makes him want to throw up</a>. He should try being pregnant.</p> <p>His delicate stomach and weak understanding of the constitution notwithstanding, he knows that getting in bed with the anti-feminist evangelicals energizes social conservatives, helping him fight Romney to a delegate-count tie in the Michigan primary \u2013 a state Romney, who grew up there, should have won decisively.

      "bodyText": "Since voting in Iran's parliamentary vote on Friday, the former reformist president Mohammad Khatami has found himself in the middle of a heated controversy over his participation in an election the opposition largely boycotted. Iran's state media, which denounced Khatami for his pro-Green movement views in 2009, devoted significant coverage to his voting. Many activists, infuriated at his taking part in the poll, accused Khatami of betraying the Green movement. Some said he had marked the end of his political career by \"turning a blind eye\" to the hundreds of journalists and campaigners behind bars, including Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who were placed under house arrest in February 2011. Others defended him, however, saying he may have been forced to vote, or as a moderate figure may have had practical reasons to do so. The Iranian activist Hossein Nourinejad, who met Khatami on Saturday, said the reformist leader had voted in an attempt to avert extremists' plan for a huge post-election crackdown. Khatami was forced to take to his official website to offer some explanations. In his open letter, Khatami wished for \"a mutual understanding of the current situation\", and said he had voted in order to protect reformists from further harm. Among the many contradictions and paradoxes of Iranian politics was a picture, taken by the semi-official Mehr news agency, showing a young man voting on Friday while wearing a \"God bless America\" T-shirt. Vote-counting is still going on. In Tehran, the counting has finished, and the MP at the top of the list is the former parliamentary speaker Gholamal Haddad-Adel, a staunch ally of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Observers believe the race for the position of the next parliamentary speaker will be between Haddad-Adel and the current speaker, Ali Larijani, who has gained his seat for another term from the holy city of Qom. Of the capital's 30 seats, 25 have gone to the second round. And finally, the National Iranian American Council, a nonprofit organisation based in the US, has published a very interesting advert in the Washington Post, in the form of a letter from US military officials to President Obama asking him to resist what it calls Israeli pressure for a \"war of choice\" with Iran.

Similarly coloured tendrils also streamed northward across the ocean, their flow sometimes interrupted by icebergs. Multiple factors might account for the ghostly shapes, including low-lying clouds or katabatic winds \u2013\u00a0downslope winds blowing toward the coast, which can freeze the water at the ocean surface. But an intriguing and perhaps more likely explanation involves processes occurring below the ice shelf. An ice shelf is a thick slab of ice often fed by glaciers attached to the coastline. The shelf floats on the ocean surface, with seawater circulating underneath. Like most ice shelves, the Amery is very thick in the upstream area near the shore. It thins significantly as it stretches northward away from the continent </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386898655\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330955757849/Tropical-Cyclone-Jasmine-010.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite Eye on Earth: Tropical Cyclone Jasmine\" width=\"617\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After raking Vanuatu with hurricane-force winds, tropical cyclone Jasmine remained well-organised as it travelled south-eastward over the South Pacific Ocean. The distinct eye has expanded, and now measures about 60 nautical miles (69 miles) in diameter. The storm is expected to continue tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge, carrying it north-eastward, directly toward Tonga. By 14 February a break in the ridge is expected to allow Jasmine to recurve to the north-west, away from Tonga but into warmer waters. At that time, the cyclone may once again intensify</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386898683\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330955749258/Lake-Fitri-is-an-endorhei-008.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite Eye on Earth: Lake Fitri is an endorheic or \u201cterminal\u201d lake in the southern Sahara Desert\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lake Fitri is an endorheic or 'terminal' lake in the southern Sahara. Deserts get so little rainfall that the rivers passing through them often cannot reach the sea, instead ending at depressions in the land surface where they form lakes. (Note that the image is rotated so north is to the lower left.) Muddy, yellow-brown water marks the centre of the basin, with a ring of dark brown muds and burnt vegetation on the exposed lake floor to the north (lower left). The shoreline supports a thin line of reeds and floating grass vegetation, which appears as dark green in the image. The usually dry Wadi Batha empties into Lake Fitri from the east (image top). Over time, water flow in Wadi Batha has created a large delta, which occupies the entire top left third of the image (for scale, the lake is 23km long). Lake Fitri and its surroundings have been designated under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ISS/NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386898672\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330955741989/Ships-trails-006.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite Eye on Earth: Ships trails\" width=\"400\" height=\"525\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ships travelling over the Pacific off the coast of the western United States etched their movements in the sky above them, leaving trails of bright white clouds. Clouds are formed when water vapour condenses on to a small particle, such as dust or a salt crystal. Ships burn fossil fuel, and emit small aerosol particles which can act as a nucleus for cloud formation. While ships travel in this region constantly, clouds do not always form over their tracks. In order for such clouds to form, three things must occur. First, the ship must emit small particles in the exhaust, which provide the cloud condensation nuclei. Second, there must be very humid air in the ship's path, and third, the air surrounding the vessel must be non-turbulent. All three conditions were met on the day this image was captured</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386898567\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330955732139/underwater-volcanic-erupt-003.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite Eye on Earth: underwater volcanic eruption off El Hierro Island persists\" width=\"400\" height=\"491\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four months after it began, the underwater volcanic eruption off El Hierro Island persists. This natural-colour satellite image, collected on 10 February shows the site of the eruption, near the fishing village of La Restinga. Bright aquamarine water indicates high concentrations of volcanic material. Immediately above the vent, a patch of brown water resembles a turbulent hot tub and indicates when and where the eruption is strongest. The eruption is just off the southern coast of El Hierro, the youngest of the Canary Islands at about 460km west of Morocco and Western Sahara. The Instituto Oceanogr\u00e1fico Espa\u00f1ol found that the volcano\u2019s summit is now only 120 metres beneath the ocean surface \u2013 30 feet higher than it was in mid-January.

West of Mauritania, the dust is thick enough to hide the ocean surface below. Part of the Cape Verde archipelago is faintly visible through the plume. Clouds floating overhead cast their shadows on the dust. Distinct plumes blow off the coast of Western Sahara over the ocean, but the large veil of dust in the south-west likely arose farther inland. Sandy desert covers most of Mauritania, and those sand seas may have provided the material for most of the dust in this image. The clouds in the south-east are part of a large cloud bank stretching over western Africa.

Rhodes (also known as Rodos) stretches roughly 48 miles from north-east to south-west. Its highest point, Mount Attavyros reaches 3,900 feet above sea level. A variety of vegetation thrives on the rugged island and migratory birds use it as a resting place. Humans have lived here since the Stone Age. Green vegetation is fairly abundant over the island, except for Mount Attavyros and some spots along the coast. Satellite images such as this have contributed to geologists\u2019 understanding of the island\u2019s history and structure. Geologists now understand that our planet\u2019s surface is composed of plates that move relative to each other.

It can be a grand act of self-delusion and hubris (see the Guns N' Roses Use Your Illusion debacle) or manic footstamping that ends with someone getting arrested (Erykah Badu springs to mind). But for Dylan Carlson and Earth, it was literally a matter of life and death. Released last month, the follow-up to 2011's sublime Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light 1 is a collection of mostly improvised songs recorded as a safeguard for Carlson, 44, suffering from the effects of drug use, in case he never got the chance to commit his ideas to tape again. \"I had liver disease and was definitely not healthy at the time we did the record. I was really, really sick, so I think that's why we did so much in one fell swoop \u2026 just in case.\" Carson smiles ruefully, his grey greatcoat and colonial moustache \u2013 not to mention his avuncular drawl \u2013 making him seem every inch the southern gentleman, albeit one who has spent his life in Seattle, and has been a fixture of its music scene since the grunge era. Mercifully, the illness that prompted the recording of Angels of Darkness II has since been brought under control \u2013 \"It's a permanent condition, but I'm on medication\" \u2013 and the band are currently on tour in Europe promoting the album. To label Earth as an instrumental post-rock band is to do their sleepy, panoramic soundscapes a major disservice \u2013 they are the soundtrack to the great American road movie that has yet to be made. (\"I'd love to score a film,\" says Carlson. \"Unfortunately, right now, Hollywood is making really, really bad movies.\") Abandoned gas stations caught on sun-bleached Polaroids; desolate highways with a shimmer of heat haze in the middle distance: while not quite a blank canvas \u2013 everything about Earth's music speaks of Americana \u2013 it's the spaces between the ponderous beats and lazy, reverb-soaked guitars that fire the imagination. And Carlson is more than happy to let the audience fill in the gaps. \"Music is a collective thing \u2013 the audience and the band create the situation, so I think it's cool when people have an experience with the music and then tell you what they felt, and it's similar to your own,\" he says. \"So the music does something more than just take up space \u2013 it conveys information in a way that language can't.\" It seems a long way from Earth's original incarnation \u2013 when Carslon (with the occasional input of his friend Kurt Cobain) would explore the limits of his amps (and the tolerance of Seattle's audiences) with walls of feedback-drenched noise, inadvertently inventing drone metal and inspiring a generation of artists such as Sunn O))) (their name a pun on Earth and the brand of amps they used and abused), Om, Khanate and many more. It's a development that bemuses Carson. \"When I started out, I didn't plan for anything to happen. And, at the time, the audience wasn't as appreciative as they are now. Buzz [Osborne] from the Melvins told me: 'You can do two things \u2013 you can try and be the next big thing, or you can just keep doing what you're doing, and eventually people will pay attention. I pursued the second course.\" It was Sunn O))) who prompted Carlson to start writing music again after a 10-year hiatus, their label, Southern Lord, reissuing his early material, and providing a thread of continuity for him to introduce his new, less confrontational instrumentals. \"They've been hugely supportive,\" says Carlson. \"There was a time when I wasn't doing anything, they were keeping the word out there, so more power to them. With their own music, they've taken something I did and expanded it. I took my influence, and that's how it works. There's no original ideas, it's just one big loop \u2013 so long as you take your influences and do something different, then that's cool.\" And, although there is a marked difference between the two eras of Earth \u2013 it's quite a leap to go from abrasive noise to ruminative, cello-led studies of dark nights of the soul \u2013 Carlson is confident even his earliest fans are still along for the ride. \"That's the great thing about metal audiences, they love music,\" he says. \"They don't give an eff for trends. If they like you, they stick with you. So we're lucky we have that group, but it keeps expanding.\" So does he envisage any conflict between the diehards and the new constituencies attracted by their excursions into jazz (2008's The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull featured jazz guitarist Bill Frisell) and folk? \"I still think of us of as a rock band, but we have a broad appeal. Everyone seems to get along at the shows. There's no fights breaking out between the folkies and the metal kids,\" he says, laughing. One source of friction in Carlson's life has been that, for years, he was best-known as being Cobain's closest friend, and for the fact he bought the gun the Nirvana singer used to kill himself. However, it's an unfortunate association \u2013 despite the hoopla over Nevermind's 20th anniversary last year, Carlson managed to avoid it all, for the most part. \"I sort of didn't notice until I was taking a bus to the doctor and passed the EMP, Seattle's rock'n'roll museum, and they were having a huge vaudeville about it, which seemed so strange to me,\" he explains. \"It's weird. There's the public guy, and there's the friend I knew, and I try to keep them separate. It's seems enough time has passed so I don't get dragged into it any more. It's not like the first few years after it happened, so that makes it easier to deal with.\" While recent history is something Carlson is keen to avoid, delving further back into the past has become a passion. His next project is to explore English and Scottish folk music, and travel across the UK making field recordings like a modern-day Alan Lomax. From ear-punishing heavy-metal noise to exploring the building blocks of popular song, Carlson's approach to music \u2013 stripping it down to its constituent parts \u2013 is almost regressive in its progression. Is the ultimate goal to find some kind of connection to simpler times? \"I hope so. I have a computer now, which I never used to have, and I'm being forced to engage with the modern world. But I'm one of those people who thinks the golden age was some mythical time in the past. It's not on its way \u2013 I'm a little pessimistic that way,\" he says. \"There was a time when knowledge was magical; music was magical. It was a magical world, and these things had value, whereas now \u2026\" Carlson trails off with a mournful smile, letting the silence, like in so much of his music, tell the story. \u2022 Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light II is out now on Southern Lord. Earth play the Button Factory, Dublin, on Monday 5 March. Then tour until 12 March. For more details, visit thronesanddominions.com.",

      "bodyText": "Join our community! Welcome to the Guardian's music site, home to all of the Guardian and the Observer's music news, reviews, features, interviews, blogs and more. We're very proud of our award-winning journalism*; but we also value the knowledge and passion of you, our readers, and we want to give you the chance to share that with us and the millions more of you who visit here every month.There are loads of ways to get involved, from swapping facts about obscure B-sides and collectible vinyl, to telling us what's on your latest playlists and recounting tales of memorable gigs. Here's how to do it. Sign up First things first, if you haven't already done so, set up a guardian.co.uk account and create a profile. Once you've done that you can comment on most of the stories we publish. But that's not all: We have several regular series where we invite you to tell us more about the music you love. Live music: Coming up Every Monday we open up the list of gigs that our critics will be attending in the coming days \u2013 and we want you to tell us about the live music you're excited about. Readers' panels If you'd like to write \"above the line\" (not to be confused with walking the line, or indeed white lines) as well as in the comments, here's the place to start. On most Tuesdays we post a call-out asking for your thoughts on a particular band, solo artist or album, and we post the results the following Friday. Readers Recommend Each Friday, we ask you to nominate your favourite songs on a certain topic. We pore through your suggestions, and the following Thursday, publish a playlist featuring the cream of the crop. Blog Jam Do you have a blog where you write about music? If so, we'd like to hear more about what you do. Check out the Blog jam page to find out how to get your site featured. Now listening: Reader playlists Yes, we know you have excellent tast in music. But how would you like to show it off and tell us about the tunes you're listening to right now? Each Wednesday we publish a playlist from one reader. See here for details on how to participate. Share your pictures Do you ever take pictures at gigs and think they might be deserving of a wider audience? If so, upload them to our gig pictures Flickr group. We often select pictures from the the group to feature in galleries on guardian.co.uk/music, and will always link back to your work. To submit your pictures, visit this page, click the \"join this group\" link, agree to the terms and conditions and follow the instructions to upload your pictures to the group. Write album reviews and star-rate records There's a dedicated page for every one of more than 3 million albums on our site \u2013 containing (in most cases) a description, a track listing and links to other albums by the same artist. If our critics have reviewed the record, their review should be there too \u2013 and if they haven't, you can beat them to it. To find an album you want to review, type the name of the artist into the \"find any artist\" search box on the righthand side of guardian.co.uk/music, then click the appropriate name from the search results. This will take you to the artist page where, on the left hand side, you'll see a list of all that artist's albums. Click the name of the album you want to review, which will take you to that album's dedicated page. Once there, use the \"post your review\" link for text entry box, or, if you'd just like to give the album a star rating, use the \"add your rating\" link at the top of the page. An artist page functions in much the same way as an album page. You can't \"review\" an artist, but you can add their name to your various lists. Create lists Lists are a way of compiling your favourite (or not-so-favourite) artists and albums on the Guardian website, and letting other readers know that little bit more about you. Check out some examples of lists of artists and lists of albums created by other users. When you're on an album or artist page, click the \"add to list\" button. You'll be presented with several list options \u2013 just tick the lists to which you want to add an album or artist. Contact the community coordinator!

The aim is to get young people to paint a self-portrait for inclusion in one of the world's biggest-ever art installations. If you would like your school to take part, a good place to start is the Face Britain assembly, available for both primary and secondary pupils. It explains the project \u2013 open to anyone aged four-16 \u2013 and shows how students at one school in Wales got involved. Face Britain has produced teachers' notes. Younger pupils could try making sticky paper mosaics or collages, while those aged 11-16 might enjoy making clay characters or using photographs as a stimulus. Alternatively, students can create still life drawings or paintings of objects that represent them. For a self portrait in the style of Vincent van Gogh, encourage pupils to use swirling, colourful brush strokes and avoid outlines. Useopposite colours to create a portrait in the style of Claude Monet, or try a Pointillism self portrait made out of dots. The National Portrait Gallery has created a two-part drawing master-class for students aged 14 to 16 \u2013 part one and part two \u2013 that contains advice from American artist and teacher Ron Bowen.Later, when the portraits are complete, advice on hanging an exhibition will help you display pupils' work effectively. There are also instructions for making ornate picture frames. Face Britain hopes that more than 28,262 young people will upload their portraits to its website, allowing it to break the current Guinness World Record for the most artists contributing to the same art installation. The closing date for entries is 31 March. The Guardian Teacher Network has more than 100,000 pages of lesson plans and interactive materials. To see and share for yourself go to teachers.theguardian.com. There are also hundreds of jobs on the site; for a free trial of your first advert, go to schoolsjobs.theguardian.com.",

Like Nigella, taking pleasure in the food you eat is linked with satisfaction. The more satisfying a meal, the less food you will need to eat to feel like you\u2019ve had enough. However, a few tweaks to Nigella\u2019s diet wouldn\u2019t go amiss. Judging purely \u2013 and perhaps unfairly \u2013 from her tweets, many meals lack balance, with no fruit or vegetables in some and carbs or proteins omitted in \u00adothers. Some meals are low on fibre and high on saturated fat. She could do with good slow-burning wholegrains for steady energy \u2013 wholewheat macaroni or a seeded \u00adbagel. She should combine a wholegrain starchy food with meat/fish or pulses accompanied by fruit and vegetables and would benefit from more good fats found in olive or rapeseed oils or oily fish such as sardines and salmon. <em>Sasha Watkins is a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. </em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Pacific UK</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "It's early afternoon and a small band of protesters are starting to congregate outside Tesco Metro on Market Street in Manchester as two community support officers in high-visibility jackets look on nervously. The protesters, members of Manchester Against Benefit Cuts, are here to express their anger over the Coalition's controversial mandatory work schemes, dubbed \"workfare\" \u2013 a fusion of work and welfare \u2013 by opponents of the programmes. Banners are unfurled and placards hoisted outside Tesco, one of the largest companies to participate in the work schemes and one increasingly targeted by Right to Work campaigners, as the protesters begin a boisterous chant of Workfare? No way! We won't work if you don't pay. The welfare-to-work schemes have come under the spotlight in recent weeks for forcing jobseekers to work for no additional pay and threatening those that drop-out of the schemes with sanctions. Although the Department of Work and Pensions dropped sanctions for jobseekers who voluntarily chose to leave the government's work experience scheme, they remain in place for the DWP's other four mandatory schemes. Outside Tesco Metro I speak to Paris Thompson, 25, a kitchen porter and a member of Manchester Against Benefit Cuts. He says: These sort of schemes are already quite widespread in America. One of the main effects is it drives down wages. How on earth can workers organise to get better wages when the company are bringing in other workers they are paying nothing? It has a massive effect on the workforce. Tesco today announced 20,000 new jobs over the next two years, net of its current workforce; and David Cameron dismissed the anti-workfare protesters as \"Trotskyites\" in Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions. But his view is one which Thompson challenges: The fact that the government have backtracked so much and contradicted themselves so much shows that they are worried, that there is anger in the general community. If it was just a small band of left-wing activists then they wouldn't have budged on this. While there is a definite Socialist Worker presence at the demonstration, Manchester Against Benefit Cuts is an umbrella organisation that also includes people like unemployed Steph Pike, 45, formerly of Manchester Advice, Manchester Council's in-house welfare advice service which was scrapped in the local authority cuts last April. Steph sees the mandatory work schemes as part of government attempts to \"demonise\" welfare claimants and says the problem is not with the actual work placements, but with the lack of wages. She says: Work experience is a good thing, but the problem is with these mandatory schemes. Yes, give young people work experience, but pay them for that work experience. The government want people to get experience of the world of work, in everything bar being paid for that work, which is a major part. When you're talking about companies that are making millions of pounds of profit, I find it unfeasible that they can't afford to pay the people who are doing their work experience. Most people I speak to seem sympathetic to the protesters and their cause. Observing the protest outside McDonalds in St Anne's Square, Natasha Stott, 31, a freelance artist from Oldham, says: I am totally opposed to the idea of people being asked to work for free, it's immoral isn't it? It should be your choice. If you want to volunteer in a workplace, you should be able to decide where it is, and it's probably not going to be McDonalds. However, some do find the anti-workfare message harder to stomach. Outside Topman on Market Street I speak to Stefan, who doesn't want to give his surname but is 53 and a financial adviser in the debt industry. He says: At the end of the day, any work is better than no work. I'm probably from a different generation, but I believe that if they have an opportunity to gain some experience, then they should take it. At least it is experience, it's giving them something to get up for in the morning for, some kind of self-pride, rather than doing nothing sitting at home. You have to start somewhere? How do you get people back into work without experience? Tom Midlane is a freelance journalist based in the north-west.

Another problem lies in the subject, does this subway warrant six pictures being made of tiles at various angles? If they were all as strong in composition as 'Frame Strap on Tiles' it would certainly have been worth it, but the rest of these images leave us wanting more. This is mainly due to their composition and the fact the mirror and tiles don't seem strong enough to hang all the images on.

      "bodyText": "Demand for the Raspberry Pi computer \u2013 a \u00a322 British-designed system \u2013 was still running at 700 per second at the end of last week, according to one of its main distributors in the UK. The device, intended to make programming simple and accessible for children much as the BBC Micro and Sinclair Spectrum did in the 1980s, has also attracted interest from a Middle East country which plans to issue one to every schoolgirl, said Harriet Green, chief executive of Premier Farnell, which is selling the device via its site. \"It's interesting to look at why there's so much excitement around Raspberry Pi,\" said Green. \"I think that a lot of teachers, parents and children are worrying that they're becoming just consumers \u2013 taking something out of a box and plugging it in. There's a lot of points of concern about children being just consumers rather than creators and innovators.\" The Raspberry Pi, whose price is fixed by the charity that controls it at $35 (and then adjusted locally via exchange rate), has already sold its initial production run, of around 10,000 units, which were sold through two companies, Premier Farnell and RS. \"Demand was 20 times greater than our supply,\" said Green. But the price will not be raised; the company will simply increase production as far as it can to meet demand. \"There's a relationship between ubiquitous supply and how much it costs,\" said Green. \"If you go back to the days of Amstrad and the success it had, you realise that there's a great skill in getting the price right.\" She says the design itself is \"beautiful\" but \"doesn't cost much to make\" \u2013 leaving enough profit to make it sustainable. The first version of the device, which sold out within minutes of going on sale on 29 February, is a simple circuit board without packaging, and will go to developers so that they can write supporting code which can then be preinstalled on to later versions, expected to go on sale in the autumn with proper packaging. Besides interest in the UK, Green said that there had also been interest from a Middle East government which wanted to give one to every schoolgirl in order to enhance their job prospects. She declined to name the country, but said \"the inclusion of girls is very important. A survey a couple of years ago which asked women aged 13 to 18 what they wanted to be, and it was quite salutary to read the results. The primary thing they wanted to be was a superstar or a Wag. There weren't any wanting to be businesswomen, lawyers or journalists. I'm not a programmer, but it isn't hard with the right capability.\" She thinks that there is even the possibility for the ultra-cheap device \u2013 which has connectors for a keyboard, display, network and USB devices such as a hard drive \u2013 to have a \"subversive\" effect on the entire PC industry. \"There's absolutely nothing to prevent the likes of Apple or Dell or Lenovo or HP from doing something similar to us,\" Green said, adding \"I would really encourage the major companies to have a look at the power of this idea.\" While the Raspberry Pi does not have the fastest or most powerful central processor available \u2013 relying instead on one that would typically be found in a smartphone, using the Arm architecture designed by a team that originally worked on the BBC Micro \u2013 Green thinks that it has the potential to grow enormously. She says too that social media and online communities have helped keep interest in the project high. A programming community called Element 14 \u2013 the atomic number of silicon, a key material in chips \u2013 has a large Raspberry Pi group, and so far there have been 30,000 downloads of the operating system software for the device, an order of magnitude more than have actually been made. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2012 because the original said Element 14 \"has grown up around the interest in writing programs for the device\". Element 14 was created in 2009.",

      "bodyText": "National Football League players are being paid good money to maim each other. Which apparently is news. A moral crisis, even. Not because said players are receiving official league paychecks to, you know, maim each other, but rather because the maiming in question is intentional, and also being funded by the rough equivalent of an informal office bonus pool. Note: the last part is totally, totally scandalous. Confused? Nostrils tickled by a faint whiff of rank hypocrisy, emanating from the spectacle of violent men being reprimanded for violent deeds in the context of a violent game? Follow along. Last week, the NFL announced that the New Orleans Saints violated league rules by running a multi-season bounty program, run by former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, in which defenders paid into a kitty and received cash rewards for injuring opposing players: $1,000 if an opponent was carted off the field; $1,500 if he was knocked out of the game altogether; amounts doubling and tripling in the playoffs. Before the 2009 NFC title game, Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma reportedly threw $10,000 on a table and promised it to anyone who took out Minnesota's Brett Favre. Perhaps unsurprisingly, New Orleans defenders went on to mercilessly batter the Vikings quarterback, registering a vicious high-low hit as Favre threw a decisive late-game interception. Moreover, Williams reportedly ran similar programs \u2013 what he charmingly dubbed \"pay for performance,\" as if his defenders were used car salesmen receiving steakhouse gift cards for hitting their monthly sales targets, as opposed to hitting the likes of Favre and retired quarterback Kurt Warner \u2013 with the Washington Redskins and Buffalo Bills. For its part, the NFL is not amused. According to multiple reports, league commissioner Roger Goodell is expected to slap the Saints with a more severe punishment than the fines and forfeited draft picks levied upon the New England Patriots for videotaping their opponents' coaching signals in the 2007 SpyGate scandal. In other words: in professional football, it's bad to cheat. But it's far worse to accept tips for doing your job. Particularly for doing it well. In fact, that's why Goodell has to crack down. Here's the thing about football: it's a hurting profession, a fundamentally vicious game. Always has been. In 1905, a University of Chicago professor called it a \"boy-killing, man-mutilating, money-making, education-prostituting, gladiatorial sport\" \u2013 and that was nearly a century before anyone had heard of the mind-mincing, brain trauma-induced disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Still, we accept the carnage, the crushing blows and kill shots, the pregame needles of Toradol and the subsequent damage done. More to the point, we enjoy the mayhem, thrilling to every collision. The hitting is the action is the juice. And a big part of our pleasure \u2013 how we rationalize and justify our collective, bloodthirsty id \u2013 comes from placing pro football into a particular, peculiar context. From looking at the sport not as glorified human cockfighting \u2013 like, say, boxing \u2013 but as something more honorable and benign. Something akin to arm wrestling. Arm wrestling revolves around physical domination. Participants inflict and endure pain and suffering. They even get injured, sometimes severely. That said, they don't mean to harm each other. There's no malice, no vicious intent. Harm isn't the point of the exercise; it's simply an inevitable, unfortunate outcome, like the radioactive waste produced from a nuclear power plant. Come Sundays, we tell ourselves the same thing every time a football player is carted off the field. When I first heard about the Saints bounty story, I reached out to David Meggyesy. A former NFL linebacker, Meggyesy also is something of a football hippie, a freethinking longtime union organizer who has written critically about the dehumanizing aspects of the sport and its culture. I figured he would blast the league's hypocrisy for preparing to penalize the Saints; instead, he echoed the above. \"When I played it was not so much inflicting pain or injury as it was making a good play to effect the outcome of the game,\" Meggyesy said. \"A good hard tackle was part of the game and a joyful part of the game. If I did injure someone, I was not pleased and did not want to see it happen \u2013 but recognized it was part of the game itself. It could be said the game is hard enough, violent enough without bounties being given to injure and maim your opponent.\" Sounds reasonable. Except for one thing: physical harm being part of the game itself. That's where the problem lies, the fundamental contradiction at the heart of football's appeal, the dirty little secret no one wants to acknowledge. When a sport is inherently brutal \u2013 when the harm is baked in, when the point of the game is to move and/or retard the advance of the ball by knocking someone on their ass, hard, and when participants are rewarded for their skill and courage in doing so \u2013 then the whole honorable notion of not meaning to hurt someone becomes arbitrary, more or less irrelevant, fullbacks dancing on the head of a pin. Former NFL player and scout Bucky Brooks wrote on the league's website that when he was with the Kansas City Chiefs, players routinely were given framed pictures of their biggest hits during team meetings. Income tax considerations aside, this is fundamentally different than cash bounties \u2026 how? Suppose I'm a Saints linebacker. Suppose you're an opposing quarterback. I'm trying to sack you so hard that you fumble the ball \u2013 giving my team a better chance to win, and upping my contract renegotiation leverage in the process. Maybe I'm not trying to concuss you. No matter. Chances are good that I'll end up doing so, either by whiplashing your neck or slamming your head into the turf. What's the more likely result of a \"good, hard tackle\" \u2013 broken ribs, or an impromptu ice cream social? The hitting is the action is the juice. Players know this. And frankly, a lot of them are trying to hurt each other. Dave Pear, a former All-Pro defensive lineman who won a Super Bowl with the Oakland Raiders, told me that bounties on particular offensive players were commonplace in the 1970s. Atlanta receiver Roddy White and Buffalo linebacker Shawne Merriman are among more than a half-dozen current players who say the same practice remains commonplace today. Dan Daly, a football historian and longtime writer for the Washington Times, told me that bounties go back to the 1950s \u2013 the only real difference is that old school players threw $5 to $10 in the kitty, as opposed to thousands of dollars. \"It's a fundamental part of the NFL's culture that isn't talked about outside of team facilities,\" wrote former NFL safety Matt Bowen \u2013 who played under Williams in Washington \u2013 in the Chicago Tribune. \"I'm not saying it's right. Or ethical. But the NFL isn't little league football with neighborhood dads playing head coach. This is the business of winning. If that means stepping over some line, you do it.\" This is real reason BountyGate qualifies as a scandal, and why the league has to come down hard on New Orleans: not because the team crossed a line, but because they offered a peek at the battered men and human heat-seeking missiles behind the curtain. Whether you're earning an above-board paycheck or an off-the-books bonus, trying to injure or just trying to make a good, hard tackle, the unsettling truth is this: someone's getting hurt. There is no line. There's simply the one we draw in our heads, the one that makes the NFL as enjoyable as action movies and \"Madden\" and other televised diversions in which actual people aren't actually damaged. The hypocrisy here isn't coming from the league. But don't take my word for it. Ask Favre. Contacted by Sports Illustrated's Peter King, the retired quarterback was asked about the beating he took against the Saints. \"I'm not pissed,\" he said. \"It's football. I don't think anything less of those guys.\" Favre was right. That's football. It ain't arm wrestling.",

      "bodyText": "\"In 1911 a paper based system where you queued up in person for a chitty with little certainty of success may have been fine; in 2011 it's wrong,\" complained William Perrin, founder of the online community enterprise, Talk About Local, last year. \"I can't understand why basic information about our courts isn't available online\". The government has indicated it will overturn the ban on television cameras in court and the lord chief justice has permitted live court tweeting by journalists and \"legal commentators\" in recent guidelines. But little progress has been made in regards to widening digital availability of court documents and improving courts access. I've argued before that English law is locked behind paywalls, prohibiting access to justice by researchers and journalists as well as the general public. Lawyers may be increasingly blogging and providing in-depth legal information, but they are not loudly protesting about the lack of free services \u2013 perhaps because they are not always the ones feeling the personal cost. Unnecessary financial barriers are part of the problem, but the attitude of court staff towards transparency also gets in the way. The court reporter Will Gant put together a short memo for the courts service on difficulties he had encountered reporting magistrates' courts. In it, he describes how one of his colleagues was ordered to collect weekly magistrates' court lists in a locked metal box when working at a local newspaper in south Wales. The reporter was under strict instructions not to open it until safely in the newspaper office. \"Since much of the information was subsequently published in the newspaper itself, this level of paranoia was patently absurd,\" Gant commented. He then described how a member of staff at Westminster Magistrates' Court confiscated a printed case list, telling him it contained \"confidential\" information. The obfuscation is not restricted to court documents. At a conference about open justice at City University London last week, Mike Dodd, co-author of the 21st edition of McNae's Essential Law for Journalists and editor of the Press Association's Media Lawyer service, said: \"In some courts security staff have been known to refuse journalists access to the body of the court itself\u2026 they insist that journalists have to go and sit in the public gallery\". It is not that Dodd objects to sitting with ordinary members of the public, but that the galleries are not designed for accurate reporting: a restricted view of the lawyers and defendants, terrible acoustics and no place to put your notebook are \"hardly conducive to open justice\". Of course, that scenario arise when journalists actually go to court: a decline in widespread court reporting is partly due to the fact that newspapers are no longer able to financially resource the daily and detailed court reporting of yore, as described by Professor George Brock on his blog. The motivation of legal authorities to block open access to documents and court proceedings is unclear: mindset or cost? Either way, the Ministry of Justice and its agency, HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), need to be shown that, as the barrister Adam Wagner, has put it: \"most of the problems identified could be solved by clear thinking and a little money\". In my view, the emphasis should be on the \"little\". Huge sums do not need to be paid to private contractors. Mike Dodd has also described difficulties accessing court orders: \"Despite the fact that we have technology which allows the Encyclopaedia Britannica to be kept on a disc\u2026 it is impossible to find out, out-of-hours, what court reporting restrictions are in place\". Ministry of Justice plans for a court order database, which would have been run by a commercial company, \"sunk without trace\" because \"the cost to the media \u2026 was absolutely eye-boggling\". Compare that, Dodd suggested, to Scotland, which does have a service listing active criminal reporting restrictions in current cases. The blame does not lie solely with one party. The Ministry of Justice is clearly open to hearing views, as its creation of the Crime and Justice Transparency Sector Panel indicates, which sets an excellent example by publishing its minutes online. Misinformed court staff members create obstacles, in part, but the fault is not at one door: a piecemeal information dissemination system has grown up over the decades, without logical consideration of key issues. This has led, for example, to what the journalist and author Heather Brooke calls the \"transcription cartel\", in which private companies have exclusive contractual rights to supply written transcripts of court cases from official recordings \u2013 for a steep fee. Some of these problems can be overcome fairly easily in the short term. The written documents, such as claim forms and skeleton arguments, exist; we need to persuade the courts to upload and disseminate them at source. We need clearer guidelines on what is permissible in court and on the apparent clash of transparency versus data protection and copyright, which will help the public and journalists uphold their access rights. Other hurdles require longer-term action and attention. Allowing tape recorders in court, for example, would necessitate a change in the law. Perrin, who sits on the Crime and Justice Transparency Sector Panel, is calling for the publication of criminal sentencing results data. Proposed reforms such as these raise important and necessary legal and ethical questions \u2013 it's time for the Ministry of Justice to address them. Judith Townend is a PhD researcher and journalist. She convened Justice Wide Open, which took place at the Centre for Law, Justice and Journalism, City University London, on February 29 2012.

      "bodyText": "On today's Football Weekly, AC Jimbo has Gregg Roughley, Michael Hann and the returning Barry Glendenning in the pod to look back on another cracking weekend in the Premier League. One man with plenty of time now on his hands is Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, after he was finally given the boot by Roman Abramovich. It means the three-year project lasted just 257 days, and as Chelsea search for their eighth manager in as many years, where do the Blues go now? From AVB we move on to RVP, who was in devastating form against Liverpool at the weekend. Can the Arsenal striker help his team come back from the dead against Milan in the Champions League? Finally, we hear from Sid Lowe in Spain, salute not-so-plucky Fulham, and marvel at the tubby wonder that is Robbie Fowler and his winding-down-to-retirement roadshow. Next stop: Blackpool. Paolo Bandini and Raf Honigstein will be with us on Thursday, so get your questions in for them on the blog below. (Some links that might help you make sense of today's show: Chelsea's latest youth sensation (in name, at least), and Black Belt Jones.)",

He used the phrase \"merger of equals\" at every opportunity, as if mere repetition would persuade Xstrata's suspicious shareholders to be grateful for the modest takeover premium (8% on one basic yardstick) that Glencore is offering for their firm. In reality, the \"naysayers\" as Glencore's chief executive called them, heard little to encourage them to say yes to a deal structured as an offer of 2.8 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share. There was nothing wrong with Glencore's full-year results \u2013 profits, ignoring exceptional items, were up 7% at $4.06bn (\u00a32.6bn), as expected \u2013 but nor were there any great revelations about the quality of its assets. How could there be? Glasenberg can say until he's blue in the face that his copper assets in the Democratic Republic of Congo are \"tier one\" but, if you're a sceptical Xstrata shareholder, it's political risk that bothers you \u2013 and there's little Glasenberg can say on that score to reassure. As for Glencore's trading business, everybody accepts that it's more than \"a bunch of speculators,\" as Glasenberg caricatured the sceptics' view. But the doubters ask subtler questions. Will opportunities for arbitrage diminish as the greater price transparency, and use of spot markets, sweeps through the world of commodities? If so, doesn't Glasenberg's rush to combine with Xstrata at the first post-flotation opportunity betray the fear that in future it will be better to be a pure owner of physical assets, as Xstrata is, rather than a trading, owning and distributing conglomerate? In the end, the debate will come down to bald arithmetic. Glencore needs a 75% majority to succeed and can't vote its own 34% shareholding in Xstrata, so a collection of 16.5% of refuseniks in the Xstrata camp could block the deal. \"In our view, Glencore wants this deal more than the recalcitrant end of Xstrata's register and some form of a sweetener is likely to ensure the 75% voting threshold is reached,\" says HSBC's analyst Andrew Keen. That sounds like commonsense. Glasenberg, of course, would be foolish to offer any hint in advance that he is prepared to give ground: indignation at the very idea will be maintained up until the moment of the U-turn. But having conceded that some form of premium is required to get the deal done, Glasenberg shouldn't sound so surprised that some of Xstrata's investors want to push him on price.

      "bodyText": "London mayor Boris Johnson's deputy complained to Scotland Yard several times that it was devoting too many resources to the News of the World phone-hacking investigation, according to evidence submitted to the Leveson inquiry. Kit Malthouse \u2013 who is now the head of the mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, which is the successor to the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) \u2013 expressed this view \"on several occasions\" after a new phone-hacking investigation, Operation Weeting, was set up in January 2011, former Met commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said in his written statement to the inquiry. \"On several occasions after Operation Weeting had started and I had returned from sick leave, the chair of the MPA, Kit Malthouse, expressed a view that we should not be devoting this level of resources to the phone-hacking inquiry as a consequence of a largely political and media-driven 'level of hysteria',\" Stephenson wrote. Speaking about Malthouse's comments at the Leveson inquiry on Monday, he said: \"The reality was that this was wrong but that was a fairly widely held view.\" Stephenson, who took charge of the Met in May 2009, said it suffered from a \"closed mindset\" at the time and worked on the \"flawed assumption\" that the original investigation in 2006 was \"successful\". \"There was a feeling, around 2009, that the Met was more and more convinced that the original operation was a success in its totality. What we didn't do is actually go back and challenge the reasons for those decisions in 2006,\" he added. \"We got ourselves almost hooked on a defensive strategy that we would not expend significant resources without new or additional evidence.\" Lord Justice Leveson put it to Stephenson that \"the very defensive mindset\" the former commissioner described \"might be a very, very good example of the relationship and culture between the press and the police\". He said the natural position of the force was to \"fight back\" because the allegations had been made by the press. Stephenson admitted at the Leveson inquiry on Monday morning that he had not read the Guardian article in 2009 featuring new revelations about the extent of phone hacking by the News of the World. Stephenson told Leveson he heard about the article on Radio 4 while driving to Manchester for a police conference and considered it was just another \"piece of noise\" and not a priority for him. He asked the deputy assistant commissioner, John Yates, to investigate and was happy when he reported back later the same day to say that there was nothing of substance in the article. \"It was not a priority for me as a commissioner, it remained one of the many, many pieces of noise that was being dealt with,\" said Stephenson. He later admitted that he could not see what the point of the Guardian's campaign was following a meeting with the editor-in-chief, Alan Rusbridger. He was being briefed by Met officers that no new investigation was warranted. \"I just did not get the difference [between what the Guardian was alleging and what Stephenson had been told by Yates],\" he said. Leveson put it to Stephenson that this was a cursory \"back of the envelope\" decision and that Yates could have come back to him to say more time was needed to review the situation. Leveson said it was not \"a white heat moment\" that required a decision that day. Stephenson said he occasionally had meetings with Yates after this when it was apparent the phone-hacking story \"wasn't going away, particularly after the New York Times article in September 2010\". This article contained fresh allegations by a former News of the World reporter, the late Sean Hoare, that Andy Coulson had been aware of phone hacking when he edited the paper. But Stephenson said he was happy with the briefing he got from Yates right up to December 2010 when he became ill. The inquiry heard how the Met launched a new phone-hacking investigation, Operation Weeting, in January 2011 when Stephenson was on leave of absence because of his health. He said Operation Weeting was established because the police had been given fresh information by News International. Leveson said it was \"because nobody had yet gone back to see what you already had in your locker\". Stephenson denied that it was inappropriate that Yates was asked to look at the Guardian article, given his friendship with Coulson's former deputy Neil Wallis. Last week the Leveson inquiry heard how Yates and Wallis regularly dined together and how the former newspaper executive ended up with a consultancy working with Scotland Yard's PR department. Asked by Leveson were there no other staff available to review the Guardian article, Stephenson said Yates \"would have felt that he was more than equipped to deal with it\". The inquiry also heard how Stephenson had seven meetings with Wallis \u2013 two in 2008, three in 2009 and twice in 2010. He said he had nothing to do with the decision to hire the media consultancy set up by Wallis but admitted that it had \"played very, very badly\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

What we didn't do is actually go back and challenge the reasons for those decisions in 2006,\" he added.</p> <p>\"We got ourselves almost hooked on a defensive strategy that we would not expend significant resources without new or additional evidence.\"</p> <p>Lord Justice Leveson put it to Stephenson that \"the very defensive mindset\" the former commissioner described \"might be a very, very good example of the relationship and culture between the press and the police\".</p> <p>He said the natural position of the force was to \"fight back\" because the allegations had been made by the press.</p> <p>Stephenson admitted at the Leveson inquiry on Monday morning that he had not read the Guardian article in 2009 featuring new revelations about the extent of phone hacking by the News of the World.</p> <p>Stephenson told Leveson he heard about the article on Radio 4 while driving to Manchester for a police conference and considered it was just another \"piece of noise\" and not a priority for him.</p> <p>He asked the deputy assistant commissioner, John Yates, to investigate and was happy when he reported back later the same day to say that there was nothing of substance in the article.</p> <p>\"It was not a priority for me as a commissioner, it remained one of the many, many pieces of noise that was being dealt with,\" said Stephenson.</p> <p>He later admitted that he could not see what the point of the Guardian's campaign was following a meeting with the editor-in-chief, Alan Rusbridger.

      "bodyText": "When and why did you join Culture24? I joined in 2000 after 10 full-on years at [the Brighton digital culture agency] Lighthouse. We were among a handful of arts organisations that began exploring the impact of digital from the moment the web was available in the early 90s. I remember very clearly sensing the fundamental shift that these technologies would bring and seeing their potential to change the way we play, think and learn. Leaving Lighthouse was a tough decision. We had just had a visit from the Queen, won awards for innovation and bought our own building. But something changed after the birth of my daughter and returning to work, it felt that my real baby had taken the place of my other baby. So when I saw the advert for what was then a single website (24 Hour Museum), set up under the vision of Chris Smith and Loyd Grossman, it seemed perfect. It was simpler, while still allowing me to nurture my passion for culture and technology. Ten years later, I've learned that it's not the job that defines simplicity but the person! How has Culture24's remit changed over the years? What has stayed the same? I did a presentation in 2009, From portal to publisher, which tracked Culture24's journey from a sign-posting site to a destination. It mapped what we had learned about audiences, infrastructure and online publishing. Three years on, the picture has changed again and that talk would now need to be called \"From portal to publisher to platform\". The platform comes from our data aggregation work and understanding how well-structured information can be re-used in multiple places, to multiple effect for more people. You can see this trajectory of change in newspaper publishing everywhere. One important thing that hasn't changed is the 'Why do we care?' factor. The team at Culture24 is driven by a passion for the stuff, stories, artefacts and art that touch our lives in ways that mean something to us as individuals and as a society. How do you keep track of digital developments and sort the good from the bad? I don't; it is impossible. What I do try is to look for three things: \u2022 What are the big brands doing to make money and build reputation? \u2022 What are the artists who work with technology doing, in particular with software, coding and participation? \u2022 Where is there anything digital with purpose and passion that shines out above the tools used to create it? I am also a big fan of failure and think that it's underrated in the cultural sector, in particular when it comes to digital. Trying to do something new and getting it wrong can be the most powerful way to learn, if you can be open and honest about the process. This is hard when things are publicly funded as the financial justification is defined by success. I'm trying to change this and kick-start a shift in how failure is viewed with our recent Let's Get Real report and EPIC FAIL session. Who are your international partners and how do you work with them? The world of digital cultural publishing that Culture24 inhabits is relatively small internationally. We work with whoever is doing anything relevant, from museums like Powerhouse in Australia, aggregators like Plurio.net, established events like PICNIC and large scale initiatives like Europeana. There is a lot to learn from looking at challenges through another's eyes and I have always been proactive in seeking out like-minded individuals. The Culturemondo network I chair is an example of this and has taken me to Cuba, Croatia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, USA and Europe. You appear at lots of conferences. What do people want to learn from you? I think they want to know how to make technology work for them: the secret to success online, the key to good content and audience development and the formula of the illusive new business models for income generation. What they get is a lot of questions that I hope will challenge them to rethink their use of digital. My hobby horse is to ask people if they really know what they are trying to do online and who it is for 'specifically'. What are the challenges of running Culture24 as a sustainable business? Non-profits like Culture24 will always need public funding to secure our core mission and I believe this should be part of a public service based on the evidence of the role the arts play in a dynamic society. As far as online cultural goes, there is still a long way to go before there will be income generation models let alone sustainable ones. Ironically, we are often victims of our own success as people think we are a well-funded, well-resourced, big organisation. The truth is we are 10 feisty creatives, in an overcrowded office in Brighton, who go from one project to another on a mix of annual funding arrangements and hard-earned service delivery. We have also been caught in the middle of the integration of museums/library responsibilities into the Arts Council. You could say we are ahead of this curve as we have been working across all these sectors for years on the basis that audiences online don't see (or care) about which government department something falls under. Our immediate challenge is helping Arts Council to understand how our work supports many different areas of policy with the same digital infrastructure and network. Wish me luck! Does being a woman affect how you do your job. How hard is it to balance with family? Totally! Balancing the guilt I feel when away from my kids with my personal drive has been the hardest thing I've ever faced. For me, there is no point in having kids if I can't be actively involved and I have been very lucky at Culture24 being able to locate the office in my hometown of Brighton. This means I can take the kids to school, pick up twice a week and juggle holidays. It also means I am never without my iPhone, do my email in bed and rarely have a day without work in it. You studied art, film, video and music \u2013 does that background play into your work? Hugely. All my work has been about convergence, overlap of practice and the spaces between things. In the 80s it was about combining art forms and in the 90s it was about overlapping industries. Now it is about all those things combined with the added complications of policy and digital innovation thrown in. Seeking the links between everything all the time is a kind of curse, like those people who see spelling mistakes and grammatical errors wherever they exist. You are not necessarily looking for them but they are there just like opportunities. What can we expect next from Culture24? Expect a brilliant Museums at Night festival from 18-20 May with a new strand of artist-led events called Connect10; the mobile version of our www.culture24.org.uk site that will give you info on all the museums, galleries and heritage venues near you; and behind the scenes you will see us continuing to work with the BBC to feed them cultural activities for www.bbc.co.uk/thingstodo. Finally, look out for us in any new developments in cultural education online after getting some love and recognition on page 33 of the Henley review. Which other women in the arts do you most admire? My colleague Anra Kennedy, Shelley Bernstein (Brooklyn Museum), Honor Harger (Lighthouse) and Diane Lees (Imperial War Museum).

      "bodyText": "The latest attempt to award a controversial $3m Unesco prize given by Africa's longest-ruling dictator has been jeopardised by the organisation's own lawyers, who have expressed concerns over the source of funding and attempts to change the name of the award. According to confidential legal advice, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian, the prize cannot be given because of discrepancies over whether the cash comes from government accounts or those of a foundation set up in the name of Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the president of Equatorial Guinea. Maria Vicien-Milburn, director of Unesco's legal office, said the original prize statutes were \"no longer implementable\" after the regime suggested the Obiang prize for research into life sciences should be renamed after the country and funded by the government. It is the latest twist in a four-year saga since the UN agency for education, science and culture accepted the prize money. It has been thwarted from making the award by an international row over the source of the money. Human rights groups say the organisation should not honour the head of a corrupt and repressive regime. Obiang has been accused of looting his tiny nation's oil wealth while most Equatorial Guineans remain in poverty, with his family facing corruption and money-laundering investigations in France, Spain and the United States. His eldest son \u2013 a deputy ambassador to Unesco \u2013 has been accused of spending twice as much as the state's entire education budget on luxury goods in just three years. Last year, he tried to buy a \u00a3234m yacht, while a recent raid on his Paris mansion seized a treasure trove of art and antiques, including a signed Rodin statue, several Faberg\u00e9 eggs and a \u00a31.3m Louis XIV desk. The 58-member executive board of Unesco is discussing the prize at its meeting in Paris this week. It has provoked a fierce split between the west, which has nine seats, and the 14-strong African bloc. The African nations \u2013 with Zimbabwe particularly vocal and reportedly supported by Brazil and Cuba \u2013 have turned the debate into one about western attitudes to developing nations. According to a US embassy cable published by WikiLeaks, the Unesco director general manoeuvred a delay on the issue last year by claiming there were not enough applicants for the prize. But she was quoted as saying she could not hold out forever. A special committee was established to try to resolve the dispute. It reports back to the board on Tuesday with an announcement expected by the weekend. The legal advice was among submissions to this committee, said a Unesco insider. Joseph Kraus, a spokesman for EG Justice, which campaigns for human rights in Equatorial Guinea, said the inconsistencies over funding and ongoing corruption investigations meant Unesco should abolish the prize and urge Obiang to spend the money on development in his country. \"If delegates continue to support the prize, even after the prize's funding irregularities have surfaced, they risk permanently damaging Unesco's reputation,\" he said. Obiang's opponents believe he is using the prize, along with his recent presidency of the African Union, the hosting of the African Cup of Nations football tournament and invitations to British parliamentarians, to launder his regime's tarnished image. Equatorial Guinea has Africa's highest per capita gross national income and perhaps the most glaring inequality in the world. One in eight children dies before the age of five, while government spending on health and education is below the regional average in sub-Saharan Africa.",

      "bodyText": "FIVER DIGS OUT 'ROBERTO DI MATTEO AND EDDIE NEWTON TO BE IN CHARGE OF CHELSEA FIRST TEAM AFFAIRS BY 5 MARCH' BET STRUCK IN JULY AND RUSHES OFF TO PAY-OUT WINDOW In an outcome only marginally less predictable than the result and subsequent allegations of electoral fraud emerging from the presidential ballot staged over the weekend in his former Russian employer's homeland, Andre Villas-Boas was sacked from his job as Chelsea manager yesterday, apparently after spending Saturday night sleeping at the club's training ground, curled up on the floor of an equipment room in the foetal position, swaddled in a goal-net, his head resting on a pile of training bibs as he sucked his thumb and wept salty tears. Having been roundly criticised for leaving experienced prima donnas Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole out of the Chelsea team whipped by Napoli in the first leg of Big Cup, the man they call AVB (because they're his initials, see) was shown the error of his ways when he picked the duo to play against West Brom in a match Chelsea lost by the comparatively narrow margin of just one goal. The upshot? The lucky Portuguese no longer has to work for Roman Abramovich, the man who hired AVB to instigate much-needed change in the Chelsea dressing room, only to hand him his P45 eight months later when the increasingly petulant subjects of these changes spat their dummies whenever the man whose instructions they are handsomely paid to obey instructed them to do stuff they didn't want to. Despite boasting the worst win percentage of any of the 9,734 managers to have taken charge of Chelsea since Glenn Hoddle's reign, there can be little doubt that AVB was shafted by Abramovich \u2026 in so much as anyone who gets paid up to \u00a311m to not have to put up with the trigger-happy Russian eejit's comedy ownership techniques can consider themselves hard done by. But with no long-term successor having been lined up, a managerial dream team of Chelsea old boys Roberto Di Matteo and Eddie Newton has been installed until the end of the season - a three-month period of stewardship that could well end up being longer than that served by whoever takes over from AVB on a \"permanent\" basis. The Special One, Pep Guardiola and Rafa Benitez are among the bookies' favourites to take over, although the Fiver can't understand why Abramovich doesn't just name Lampard, Cole, Didier Drogba and England's Brave John Terry joint player-managers, considering these senior vipers in the dressing-room nest seem to run his club with the help of assorted media chums regardless of who is paid gazillions to bark orders from the dug-out. \"It will be hell for whoever succeeds [AVB],\" shouted World Cup-winning former Chelsea manager Big Phil Scolari, from the summit of the mountain of fifties in Abramovich Go Away money he took back to Brazil. \"Looking for what is an eighth manager in nine years is a serious embarrassment to the owner, the club, the fans and the league,\" harrumphed LMA chief executive Richard Bevan, before crossing out 'eighth' and 'nine', scribbling in 'ninth' and '10' and carefully folding away his statement for its next outing in 12 months' time. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I could definitely have had a long career in the Premiership. I see many players playing today who I am not inferior to - and perhaps even better than. Most midfielders are either defensive or attacking but I was both. I had something new\" - Ravel Mor \u2026 sorry, 46-year-old Arquimedes Nganga reveals his intention to sue the Baptist church for \u00a310m in lost earnings, claiming his faith - rather than any lack of discernible talent - ruined his chance of playing for Manchester United. The church, unsurprisingly, will \"vigorously contest the claim\". FIVER LETTERS \"re: friday's last line. i have to admit that your lower case sign-off looks really modern so knock it off. i expect much less from you has-beens and nostagia-lites\" - robi polgar. \"This is what happens when you try it in lower case\" - Matt Hanley. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you've nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. BITS AND BOBS Sunderland hatchet-in-chief Lee Cattermole has been banned for four games after picking up his 10th booking of the season in the Tyne-Wear derby, before talking himself into a bath with post-match potty-mouth-knack. Dead man tinkering Claudio Ranieri insists he can cope with the pressure at slumping Inter after they were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Catania. \"I hope I'll stay here as long as possible even if, like husbands, we're always the last to know,\" he cuckolded. Charity Shield dept: Portsmouth have asked the Pope's O'Rangers for a fund-raising friendly. A day after Les Parry was given the boot by Tranmere, another physio-turned-manager, Jamie Pitman, has been shown the door by League Two strugglers Hereford. Walsall coach Richard O'Kelly has been appointed as the Bulls' new boss and he wasted little time in overhyping his new employers: \"It's my first job as manager but what better team to start with.\" Hamburg striker Paolo Guerrero faces an eight-match ban after being given the most obvious red card of the season during his team's 4-0 defeat to Stuttgart. Atalanta coach Stefano Colantuono claims Napoli man crush Edinson Cavani almost took his lustrous locks to Upton Park when the pair were at Palermo. \"The Matador wanted a move to West Ham as he wanted to try out an adventure in the Premier League,\" said Colantuono in what seems like an interestingly translated quote. And Powerlines FC goalkeeper Thabang Louw has defended his performance in the 24-0 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns in South Africa's Nedbank Cup. \"I saved here and there. I did what I could,\" he sniffed. STILL WANT MORE? If AVB hadn't been axed, this lovely song wouldn't have been made. If Luis Suarez ran less he might score more than the one goal every 14.8 shots that he currently manages, nerds Michael Cox, in his weekly tactics column. If Chelsea's squad aged less, they wouldn't be as battle-hardened and mutinous as they are and poor little geeky AVB might still have a job, writes Richard Williams, kind of. If Jacob Steinberg and Rob Smyth hadn't written this, then you might have been aware of five fewer things in the Premier League, including why Nice Roy could still be the right man for, erm, England. If Real Zaragoza lost less and weren't horrifically mismanaged over countless seasons, they probably wouldn't be staring at a long and painful relegation from La Liga, reports doomsayer Sid Lowe.

The old witch seemed very beautiful and wished that the prince would stay with her and marry her. He could not endure her, yet could not leave that place. One day, the bear was alone with him and spoke to the prince: \"Pull the rusty nail from the wall, so that I shall be delivered, and place it beneath a turnip in the field, and in this way you shall have a beautiful wife.\" The prince seized the nail so strongly that the cave shook and the nail cracked loudly like a clap of thunder. Behind him a bear stood up from the ground like a man, bearded and with a crown on his head. \"Now I shall find a beautiful maiden,\" cried the prince and went forth nimbly. He came to a field of turnips and was about to place the nail beneath one of them when there appeared above him a monster, so that he dropped the nail, pricked his finger on a hedge and bled until he fell down senseless. When he awoke he saw that he was elsewhere and that he had long slumbered, for his smooth chin was now frizzy with a blond beard. He arose and set off across field and forest and searched through every turnip field but nowhere found what he was looking for. Day passed and night, too, and one evening, he sat down on a ridge beneath a bush, a flowering blackthorn with red blossoms on one branch. He broke off the branch, and because there was before him, amongst the other things on the ground, a large, white turnip, he stuck the blackthorn branch into the turnip and fell asleep. When he awoke on the morrow, the turnip beside him looked like a large, open shell in which lay the nail, and the wall of the turnip resembled a nut-shell, whose kernel seemed to shape his picture. He saw there the little foot, the thin hand, the whole body, even the fine hair so delicately imprinted, just as the most beautiful girl would have. The prince stood up and began his search, and came at last to the old cave in the forest, but no one was there. He took out the nail and struck it into the wall of the cave, and at once the old woman and the bear were also there. \"Tell me, for you know for certain,\" snarled the prince fiercely at the old woman, \"where have you put the beautiful girl from the parlour?\" The old woman giggled to hear this: \"You have me, so why do you scorn me?\" The bear nodded, too, and looked for the nail in the wall. \"You are honest, to be sure,\" said the prince, \"but I shall not be the old woman's fool again.\" \"Just pull out the nail,\" growled the bear. The prince reached for it and pulled it half out, looked about him and saw the bear as already half man, and the odious old woman almost as a beautiful and kind girl. Thereupon he drew out the nail entirely and flew into her arms for she had been delivered from the spell laid upon her and the nail burnt up like fire, and the young bridal pair travelled with his father, the king, to his kingdom.",

      "bodyText": "Yusuf Dhali remembers vividly how he and his family survived when cyclone Aila destroyed his village as it struck Bangladesh's south-western coastal region three years ago. He was in the fields when the Kholpatua river surged over the 30ft-high earthen embankment, sending a wall of water across the fields. \"I ran home when I saw the water and grabbed my wife, son and daughter,\" he said. \"We hung on to a tree for two or three hours during the storm.\" No one in Adarsha Gram died in the storm that killed 300 people and destroyed 4,000km of roads and embankments. But the villagers saw their livelihood from shrimp farming wiped out. The river created a lake that cut road access \u2013 the village can only be reached by boat \u2013 and deposited huge amounts of grey sludge around the village \u2013 which sits on land flat as a pancake, destroying the shrimp ponds. \"Before Aila, I lived very well from my shrimp pond,\" said Dhali. \"Now I work as a day labourer and I don't have enough money to restart the business.\" Dhali's story represents in microcosm the threat from climate change to low-lying Bangladesh. The densely populated country of 164 million is highly vulnerable to the prospect or rising sea levels and melting glaciers. Over the last 20 years, the country has been hit by six major disasters \u2013 four floods and two cyclones \u2013 affecting millions. In 1991 a cyclone killed 138,000 people, and in 2007 a combined flood and cyclone killed up to 10,000 and affected 15 million. About half of the world's deaths due to tropical cyclones have occurred in Bangladesh. Migration for those living at the edge of the Bay of Bengal \u2013 the world's largest bay \u2013 area is not feasible as around 15 million Bangladeshis live in areas vulnerable to climate change. Adarsha Gram lies in the Sundarbans, a watery and muddy world of mangrove forests that is home to the famed Bengal tiger, wild boars, macaque monkeys and estuarine crocodiles. With migration not a realistic option for many, adaptation becomes imperative. After Aila, Brac, a Bangladeshi NGO, supported the villagers financially and helped build cyclone-resistant homes. Designed by Brac university in consultation with the villagers and funded by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the 43 cyclone-resistant structures at Adarsha Gram now stand on four concrete pillars, which are 7ft above ground and 6ft below. Besides the houses built of wood and brick roof tiles, the village of 300 households also has a schoolhouse that doubles up as a cyclone shelter for people and livestock \u2013 a concrete staircase for people and an earthen ramp for the cows and other animals. The school's distinctive wall has gaps between the bricks, allowing wind to pass through the building so that it doesn't have to absorb the full shock of 240km/h winds. Having cyclone-resistant homes may provide some reassurance for villagers in case a cyclone hits again, but that does not feed them. Apart from destroying homes, flooding also destroys livelihoods. Three years after Aila, the villagers have only now begun to dig shrimp ponds in the expanse of grey earth that blends with grey February skies. They will, however, not be working for themselves, but for a businessman who has leased 850 acres of the communal land for shrimp farming, which is very popular in the Koyra region. But shrimp farming has a downside, explained Mohammed Zahidur Rahman, from Brac's disaster, environment and climate change programme. \"Once land is given over to shrimp farming, it becomes useless to farming after 10-15 years because the land becomes too salty,\" he said, \"and most of the profits do not go to the farmers but those businessmen who have leased the land.\" Yet, whole villages have adopted shrimp farming and the landscape in the area is full of large rectangular ponds that alternate with paddy and maize fields. Brac is promoting alternative activities such as growing salt-tolerant rice and maize, as well as crab-fattening. Crabs, which mature in 15 days, have the advantage of taking up less space and \u2013 provided they are the right size \u2013 find a ready export market in countries such as Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. But there are no simple solutions. Crabs have a tendency to fight. Those that lose a claw in combat are no good for export, although one-limbed crabs do end up in tasty curry dishes that are a welcome source of protein for some families. Crabs can also die from viruses. \"I'm earning good money. Crabs are more profitable than shrimp, but sometimes most of my crabs die,\" said Jossi Rani, at Deyara village, 23km from Adarsha Gram, as she cuts up talapia fish to feed her crabs. Apart from the threat of cyclones, a more insidious problem for those living in the Sundarbans is increasing water salination, making it hard to grow even salt-resistant rice and maize. Drinking water is also an issue. Even water in a deep aquifer \u2013 700ft \u2013 in the coastal area contains too much salt to drink. Brac has imported two desalination plants from China to provide drinking water, but they have broken down and are awaiting Chinese engineers to come and repair them. Brac's work in disaster and climate change \u2013 from training tens of thousands of residents in disaster peparedness and response to helping people earn a living \u2013 blurs the line between disaster relief and development. But in areas of high vulnerability to climate change, from Bangladesh to the drought-prone Sahel in west Africa, development and humanitarian organisations increasingly see their work as complementary. Kristalina Georgieva, the EU's head of humanitarian operations, makes the case that it is no longer affordable to wait for crises to hit when it is cheaper \u2013 and the right thing to do \u2013 is to take pre-emptive action. In the Sahel, where relief groups are working hard to prevent a humanitarian disaster from the recent drought, the EU has agreed \u20ac150m in development funding on top of \u20ac123m in emergency assistance. In Ethiopia, the World Food Programme is increasingly moving into development work, helping farmers to rehabilitate degraded soil. Three years on, the residents of Adarsha Gram have yet to recover from cyclone Aila \u2013 a stark reminder of the enormous challenges in building resilience. Shrimp farming has provided some welcome money, but the soil will get saltier and the embankment risks being weakened as villagers run pipes through it to siphon water from the Kholpatua.",

The school's distinctive wall has gaps between the bricks, allowing wind to pass through the building so that it doesn't have to absorb the full shock of 240km/h winds.</p> <p>Having cyclone-resistant homes may provide some reassurance for villagers in case a cyclone hits again, but that does not feed them. Apart from destroying homes, flooding also destroys livelihoods.</p> <p>Three years after Aila, the villagers have only now begun to dig shrimp ponds in the expanse of grey earth that blends with grey February skies. They will, however, not be working for themselves, but for a businessman who has leased 850 acres of the communal land for shrimp farming, which is very popular in the Koyra region.</p> <p>But shrimp farming has a downside, explained Mohammed Zahidur Rahman, from Brac's disaster, environment and climate change programme. \"Once land is given over to shrimp farming, it becomes useless to farming after 10-15 years because the land becomes too salty,\" he said, \"and most of the profits do not go to the farmers but those businessmen who have leased the land.\"</p> <p>Yet, whole villages have adopted shrimp farming and the landscape in the area is full of large rectangular ponds that alternate with paddy and maize fields. Brac is promoting alternative activities such as growing salt-tolerant rice and maize, as well as <a href=\"http://blog.bracusa.org/2011/02/bangladesh-farmers-fatten-crabs-on.html\" title=\"\">crab-fattening</a>. Crabs, which mature in 15 days, have the advantage of taking up less space and \u2013 provided they are the right size \u2013 find a ready export market in countries such as Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. But there are no simple solutions.</p> <p>Crabs have a tendency to fight. Those that lose a claw in combat are no good for export, although one-limbed crabs do end up in tasty curry dishes that are a welcome source of protein for some families. Crabs can also die from viruses.</p> <p>\"I'm earning good money. Crabs are more profitable than shrimp, but sometimes most of my crabs die,\" said Jossi Rani, at Deyara village, 23km from Adarsha Gram, as she cuts up talapia fish to feed her crabs.</p> <p>Apart from the threat of cyclones, a more insidious problem for those living in the Sundarbans is increasing water salination, making it hard to grow even salt-resistant rice and maize. Drinking water is also an issue. Even water in a deep aquifer \u2013 700ft \u2013 in the coastal area contains too much salt to drink. Brac has imported two desalination plants from China to provide drinking water, but they have broken down and are awaiting Chinese engineers to come and repair them.</p> <p>Brac's work in disaster and climate change \u2013 from training tens of thousands of residents in disaster peparedness and response to helping people earn a living \u2013 blurs the line between disaster relief and development. But in areas of high vulnerability to climate change, from Bangladesh to the drought-prone Sahel in west Africa, development and humanitarian organisations increasingly see their work as complementary.</p> <p>Kristalina Georgieva, the EU's head of humanitarian operations, makes the case that it is no longer affordable to wait for crises to hit when it is cheaper \u2013 and the right thing to do \u2013 is to take pre-emptive action. In the Sahel, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jan/18/eu-humanitarian-aid-offical-niger\" title=\"\">relief groups are working hard to prevent a humanitarian disaster from the recent drought</a>, the EU has agreed <a href=\"http://euroalert.net/en/news.aspx?idn=14633\" title=\"\">\u20ac150m in development funding on top of \u20ac123m</a> in emergency assistance. In Ethiopia, the World Food Programme is increasingly moving into development work, helping farmers to rehabilitate degraded soil.</p> <p>Three years on, the residents of Adarsha Gram have yet to recover from cyclone Aila \u2013 a stark reminder of the enormous challenges in building resilience. Shrimp farming has provided some welcome money, but the soil will get saltier and the embankment risks being weakened as villagers run pipes through it to siphon water from the Kholpatua.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Binyamin Netanyahu enters the White House Monday for his ninth meeting with President Barack Obama, he may well feel a mixture of infuriation and satisfaction. The infuriation is because, despite his and others' best efforts over recent weeks, Israel has failed to push the US administration into a clear commitment to military action against Iran if the Islamic republic crosses specified \"red lines\". On top of this, the Israelis had to endure public chastisement over their incessant war chatter: \"too much loose talk\" only benefits the Iranians; \"now is not the time for bluster\". The satisfaction comes from the success that Netanyahu's relentless focus on the Iranian nuclear issue, and the Israelis' repeated threats to launch a unilateral military strike, has had in pushing the issue of a peace deal with the Palestinians way down the agenda. Compared to Obama's speech to Congress last May, when he incensed Netanyahu by talking about a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, the president devoted only a few lines to the peace process in Sunday's speech. And that was mainly to explain and justify his own actions. But, overall, the speech did not deliver for Bibi. Obama stressed the importance of diplomacy and sanctions, which must be given time to have an impact: \"the only way to truly solve this problem is for the Iranian government to make a decision to forsake nuclear weapons.\" Even his statement that he would \"not hesitate to use force when it is necessary\" came with riders about timing, circumstances and the need \"to defend the United States and its interests\". Netanyahu, who is to address the Aipac conference Monday evening, issued a brief statement after Obama spoke. In three sentences, he said he appreciated the president's comments four times, including \"perhaps most important of all, I appreciated the fact that he said that Israel must be able to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.\" This was perhaps a reminder that Israel may yet go it alone. The clear differences that remain between the two leaders, and the personal antipathy that exists between them, are likely to be close to the surface during today's meetings: first, with their teams; then, one to one; and then, a formal lunch. No press conference is scheduled; a plan for joint statement bit the dust a few days ago. Having spent the past few weeks demanding a clear framework for US military action, the Israelis are now rushing to say they expected no such thing. Israel's president, Shimon Peres \u2013 whose life story and achievements featured heavily in Obama's speech \u2013 praised the address, saying the US leader had offered as much as was possible, and it was preposterous to expect a timetable to be laid down. \"I don't expect someone to say when they will do this, and when they will do that, not us or them. It's not done,\" Peres told Israel's Army Radio. \"He didn't talk about dates, but he spoke about actions.\" Reaction to Obama's speech in the Israeli press was mixed. Sima Kadmon, in Yedioth Ahronoth, put a positive gloss on the speech, saying Obama had given more time to resolve the Iranian problem by diplomacy and sanctions: \"In other words: calm down. You can come out of your shelters. Obama has promised that there will not be a war in the spring.\" The odd thing about this is that it was not the US threatening a war in the spring, and more time is not what Israel wants. But Amir Oren, writing in the liberal daily Haaretz, said the subtext of the president's words were unmistakeable. \"A strong commitment to Israel? Assuredly. Capitulation to the dictates of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu? Not a chance. After a speech like that, his meeting with Netanyahu today is almost superfluous: It already seems clear that Obama is determined not to grant him anything.\" In contrast, Palestinian politician Hanan Ashwari said Obama had done everything Israel wanted for the past three years. The Palestinian leadership, she said, was disappointed in the president's focus on Iran rather than the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. \"We know it was an election speech, it was in order to win votes and influence people, but we have many comments as to whether he is running for office in Israel or the US,\" she told reporters in Ramallah.",

      "bodyText": "The question of who Master Chief is and what makes him tick will be key elements of the Halo 4 single-player campaign \u2013 that was the message delivered by developer 343 Industries at the Xbox Spring Showcase in March. The enigmatic lead character of the original Halo trilogy is set to return to action in the fourth title, due for launch this winter, after sitting out previous prologue installment, Halo: Reach. And this time, we're told, it's personal. \"Master Chief is the heart and soul of Halo and as gamers we missed him,\" said executive producer, Kiki Wolfkill. \"We wanted to contiune his story and map out his journey over the next 10 years. It was a real challenge to think about how we take this beloved hero and move him forward.\" Graphically, the character model has received a huge overhaul. Images of Chief, as well as other Spartan soldiers, reveals densely detailed armour with a Batman-style rubberised material beneath the metallic plates and at joints. \"We want to provide a very visceral first-person experience and to deliver on the fantasy of being this 900 pound spartan, feeling that combination of strength and athleticim that defines him,\" said Wolfkill. \"We reworked the armour with an eye toward the functionality he'll need today, but also trying to think over the next decade to some of the things he could be doing.\" Although 343 Industries will not reveal the new enemy of the series, after the defeat of the Covenant, it has provided some juicy hints. \"Chief has faced an enemy in the past that he knows very well,\" said Wolfkill. \"Now he's going to face a new threat, it's very ancient, very dark and it's going to present challenges that he's never had to face before. How he does that, the decisions he has to make, will help to define him as a hero and give him more dimension as a character.\" The rumours are that this ancient antagonist will be the Forerunners, the alien race that built the halo technologies at the centre of the series. Unsurprisingly, 343 Industries would not confirm this. Speaking to the Guardian, Wolfkill stressed: \"From a game perspective, it's a completely new enemy.\" Telling an engrossing story around this new confrontation is clearly a major concern for the studio. \"There's such a rich fiction around Chief that we get in the books and other media, but it hasn't traditionally come through in the game,\" said Wolfkill. \"So how do we take some of that and really pull back the curtain on Chief and his motivations? \"We want to look under the mask, without being disruptive to the game experience. It's a first person experience, so it's about how we reflect Chief in the people around him. Obviously Cortana is his closest friend and ally and their relationship is very important for the story \u2013 she reflects Chief. In some ways, she's more human than him \u2013 so how do we capture some of that humanity?\" That whole idea of getting under the mask, seems to be a guiding element. Wolfkill also pointed out at one stage that the team was redesigning the heads-up display. The idea is to give players a real feel for being in the Spartan helmet, looking out through its visor, and interacting with its futuristic technology. Will ammo and weapon data be illustrated like an augmented reality display overlaying the visor? Something akin to the helmet cam in Need for Speed: Shift 2? We'll see. Elsewhere, creative director Josh Holmes claimed during the Xbox event that the game would have a darker feel than previous instalments. \"We want to tell a more impactful, more emotional story than ever before in a Halo game,\" he said. \"The focus is on the depth of character development. What this means for the game is a darker and more sophisticated tone \u2013 that's in service to the story we're telling and the themes that will come up through that story. And we're thinking about this in the context of a story that will be told over multiple titles, with a span of the next decade or more.\" Speaking to the Guardian, franchise director Frank O'Connor also promised a total technical overhaul for the series. \"We talked about the engine a few days ago,\" he said. \"We were asking ourselves, well, what is it exactly? If you're using a commercially available engine, it's really easy to pick a rubicon \u2013 it's version number one, or two or three, etc. But the Halo engine is more organic, it's something that's evolved over the years. \"There's still some code from Halo 1 buried in our engine, but it would probably be pretty unreconisable to the original developers. In Halo 4, almost every single system has been either radically overhauled or rewritten from the ground up. Almost nothing is untouched. I don't know what to call that! It's such a radical evolution of what it was, even as recently as Reach. The way we render, the way we stream textures, the way audio is handled \u2013 everything is very different. But the core gameplay, the spirit, is intact.\" O'Connor also hinted that we can expect much larger levels and environments in the single-player campaign of Halo 4. \"Our coding and engineering team is second to none,\" he says. \"They've done wonders. Some of our campaign levels are going to be way bigger than the already gigantic spaces seen in previous Halo titles. The 360 is a very flexible platform, and we get a lot of support from Microsoft to do things that would otherwise be very challenging.\" But O'Connor was also keen to bring the discussion back to that over-riding concern: narrative. \"The story we're telling this time is really personal. It's about characters and people, in a way that it hasn't been before. That's how you can move players. What people care about ultimately is other people.

      "body": "<p>The question of who Master Chief is and what makes him tick will be key elements of the Halo 4 single-player campaign \u2013 that was the message delivered by developer 343 Industries at the Xbox Spring Showcase in March.</p> <p>The enigmatic lead character of the original Halo trilogy is set to return to action in the fourth title, due for launch this winter, after sitting out previous prologue installment, Halo: Reach. And this time, we're told, it's personal.</p> <p>\"Master Chief is the heart and soul of Halo and as gamers we missed him,\" said executive producer, Kiki Wolfkill. \"We wanted to contiune his story and map out his journey over the next 10 years. It was a real challenge to think about how we take this beloved hero and move him forward.\"</p> <p>Graphically, the character model has received a huge overhaul. Images of Chief, as well as other Spartan soldiers, reveals densely detailed armour with a Batman-style rubberised material beneath the metallic plates and at joints.</p> <p>\"We want to provide a very visceral first-person experience and to deliver on the fantasy of being this 900 pound spartan, feeling that combination of strength and athleticim that defines him,\" said Wolfkill. \"We reworked the armour with an eye toward the functionality he'll need today, but also trying to think over the next decade to some of the things he could be doing.\"</p> <p>Although 343 Industries will not reveal the new enemy of the series, after the defeat of the Covenant, it has provided some juicy hints. \"Chief has faced an enemy in the past that he knows very well,\" said Wolfkill. \"Now he's going to face a new threat, it's very ancient, very dark and it's going to present challenges that he's never had to face before. How he does that, the decisions he has to make, will help to define him as a hero and give him more dimension as a character.\"</p> <p>The rumours are that this ancient antagonist will be the Forerunners, the alien race that built the halo technologies at the centre of the series. Unsurprisingly, 343 Industries would not confirm this. Speaking to the Guardian, Wolfkill stressed: \"From a game perspective, it's a completely new enemy.\"</p> <p>Telling an engrossing story around this new confrontation is clearly a major concern for the studio. \"There's such a rich fiction around Chief that we get in the books and other media, but it hasn't traditionally come through in the game,\" said Wolfkill. \"So how do we take some of that and really pull back the curtain on Chief and his motivations?</p> <p>\"We want to look under the mask, without being disruptive to the game experience. It's a first person experience, so it's about how we reflect Chief in the people around him. Obviously Cortana is his closest friend and ally and their relationship is very important for the story \u2013 she reflects Chief. In some ways, she's more human than him \u2013 so how do we capture some of that humanity?\"</p> <p>That whole idea of getting under the mask, seems to be a guiding element. Wolfkill also pointed out at one stage that the team was redesigning the heads-up display. The idea is to give players a real feel for being in the Spartan helmet, looking out through its visor, and interacting with its futuristic technology. Will ammo and weapon data be illustrated like an augmented reality display overlaying the visor? Something akin to the helmet cam in Need for Speed: Shift 2? We'll see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386905247\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330958666960/Halo-4-004.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Halo 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, creative director Josh Holmes claimed during the Xbox event that the game would have a darker feel than previous instalments. \"We want to tell a more impactful, more emotional story than ever before in a Halo game,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The focus is on the depth of character development. What this means for the game is a darker and more sophisticated tone \u2013 that's in service to the story we're telling and the themes that will come up through that story. And we're thinking about this in the context of a story that will be told over multiple titles, with a span of the next decade or more.\"</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, franchise director Frank O'Connor also promised a total technical overhaul for the series. \"We talked about the engine a few days ago,\" he said. \"We were asking ourselves, well, what is it exactly? If you're using a commercially available engine, it's really easy to pick a rubicon \u2013 it's version number one, or two or three, etc. But the Halo engine is more organic, it's something that's evolved over the years.</p> <p>\"There's still some code from Halo 1 buried in our engine, but it would probably be pretty unreconisable to the original developers. In Halo 4, almost every single system has been either radically overhauled or rewritten from the ground up. Almost nothing is untouched. I don't know what to call that! It's such a radical evolution of what it was, even as recently as Reach. The way we render, the way we stream textures, the way audio is handled \u2013 everything is very different. But the core gameplay, the spirit, is intact.\"</p> <p>O'Connor also hinted that we can expect much larger levels and environments in the single-player campaign of Halo 4.</p> <p>\"Our coding and engineering team is second to none,\" he says. \"They've done wonders. Some of our campaign levels are going to be way bigger than the already gigantic spaces seen in previous Halo titles. The 360 is a very flexible platform, and we get a lot of support from Microsoft to do things that would otherwise be very challenging.\"</p> <p>But O'Connor was also keen to bring the discussion back to that over-riding concern: narrative.</p> <p>\"The story we're telling this time is really personal. It's about characters and people, in a way that it hasn't been before. That's how you can move players. What people care about ultimately is other people. They want that in the context of epic tales of heroism and enigmatic galactic mystery, or whatever \u2013 but really, it's about, 'how can I identify with that character?' That's where we're really pushing the envelope.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Friends and former colleagues have paid tribute to the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord St John of Fawsley, who has died aged 82. St John-Stevas was widely dismissed as a foppish political lightweight whom Margaret Thatcher ditched at the first opportunity. But as leader of the Commons in her first cabinet he created the select committee system which will outlast much of her radicalism in keeping over-powerful governments in check. His friend and colleague Lord Heseltine called him \"a one-off, a very unusual character, combining intellect, academic abilities with the realities of politics\". He added: \"He also had a great sense of humour. As a cabinet minister he used to sit at the far end of the cabinet table and it was quite frequent that there would be an eruption of laughter from that quarter at something he said. That used to annoy the prime minister [Thatcher] but Norman had the great skill of being able to rephrase a joke to make it sound wholly innocuous.\" Since he had an excellent brain \u2013 he was educated at Cambridge, Oxford, London and Yale \u2013 St John-Stevas's flippant, dandified reputation sometimes troubled him, though it was largely his own doing. A law lecturer and amateur constitutional authority who was in demand as a royal crisis commentator on TV well into old age, it was his way of handling a flamboyant and witty personality at a time when homosexuality was not formally acknowledged in public life and actively deplored by the Tories. St John-Stevas was merely assumed to be gay by most of those who knew him: \"The thinking man's Larry Grayson\", as the Guardian's Simon Hoggart once wrote. An enthusiastic high Catholic, he threw himself into the part. Independently wealthy, he had a collection of papal memorabilia in his home in Knightsbridge, London, along with items of Queen Victoria's clothing. Outside were parked a white Jaguar and a white Rolls Royce which he would drive to Westminster, occasionally dropping off flowers for the Queen Mother at Clarence House en route. Yet beneath it all he was a serious man who chaired the Royal Fine Arts Commission, judged the Booker prize and edited the writings of Walter Bagehot. Kenneth Clarke, the justice secretary, told the BBC: \"He was very flamboyant and had a style all of his own, which was very theatrical, but actually he was an intelligent, sensitive man. He was a very, very good minister and he had very, very clear political opinions.\" As Norman St John-Stevas, he was MP for Chelmsford from 1964 to 1987, a junior education minister under Thatcher in Edward Heath's government of 1970-74, and later briefly arts minister where he delivered a bigger budget. As party leader and prime minister Thatcher stayed loyal to him despite his incorrigible frivolities which often included calling her \"Tina\", \"the blessed Margaret\", \"the leaderene\" and \"she who must be obeyed\" when talking to colleagues and political reporters. Word got back. But he was never an economic Thatcherite and the growing doubts he expressed about the direction of core policy after 1979 ensured that when she started culling the \"wets\" around the cabinet he was an easy target. St John-Stevas was the first to go in January 1981, along with Sir Ian Gilmour, an even more cerebral but less mischievous critic of the regime. Lord Tebbit, another former Conservative cabinet minister, said St John-Stevas \"did a great deal as a clear and outspoken advocate in government for the arts\". After being dropped from the cabinet St John-Stevas, however, declined to stay on in the reduced role of arts minister, a job he was already doing again part-time. Yet the 20 months he spent as leader of the Commons were far from wasted. St John-Stevas understood how politics worked in the unwritten British constitutional setting and was determined to modernise the ramshackle set of select committees which had grown up since mid-Victorian times. He persuaded the cabinet \u2013 which may not have understood the weapon he was offering to backbench troublemakers \u2013 to back his plan to create one select committee for every Whitehall department and give it modest resources, nowadays much enlarged, to hold those departments to account. Since the latest batch of reforms, backbench MPs have acquired the power to elect salaried committee chairs free from the whips' interference. St John-Stevas deserves some of the credit. After leaving office St John-Stevas went to the Lords in 1987 and was active there and in other fields until recently. The Conservative leader of the Lords, Lord Strathclyde, described St John-Stevas as a great parliamentarian who would be missed by both houses of parliament. He died on Friday after a short illness. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012. In the editing process St John-Stevas became St John. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "A nine-strong army undercover unit watched as loyalists shot a former IRA prisoner dead and wounded two fellow republicans, a Historical Enquiries Team (HET) report has concluded. The HET investigation into the 1990 murder of Sam Marshall, which happened in the centre of Lurgan, found the covert army unit had been in the area when the Ulster Volunteer Force carried out the fatal ambush. Prominent republicans including Colin Duffy narrowly escaped death at the hands of UVF gunmen believed to have come from Belfast to carry out the shootings. While the HET report praised much of the original RUC investigation and found no new lines of inquiry on the gun attack, it also cited the presence of a red Maestro car, later found to be a military intelligence vehicle, near the scene. That led to claims of a security forces role in the killing. It has emerged the car was one of six vehicles in a major surveillance operation involving nine armed undercover soldiers. Although the UVF opened fire on the men within minutes of them leaving Lurgan police station while the armed undercover soldiers were in the vicinity, the police investigators said there was no evidence of state collusion with the gunmen and no evidence that any police officer or soldier had prior knowledge of the attack. The review of the case by the HET has found that: \u2022 At least eight undercover soldiers were deployed near the scene of killing, with their commander monitoring from a remote location. \u2022 The armed military personnel at the scene were in six cars, including the red Maestro. \u2022 Two plain clothes soldiers with camera equipment were in an observation post at the entrance to the police station as the three republicans arrived and left. \u2022 The killers' two guns were never recovered, but were linked through ballistic tests to three other murders and an attempted murder. \u2022 Intelligence also linked a further murder to Marshall's murder. \u2022 Two soldiers followed the three men on foot when they left the police station, and \"partially witnessed\" the shooting. Marshall, his brother-in-law, Tony McCaughey, and Duffy were known to the security forces and were high-profile republicans. John Marshall, a brother of the 31-year-old murder victim, said: \"The gunmen meant to kill the three men that night, and it went wrong. The other two guys lived to tell the tale.\" Sam Marshall, who was a Sinn F\u00e9in member, was sentenced to seven years for arson as a teenager and took part in IRA protests for political status while he was held in the Maze prison.",

      "bodyText": "A whole new world of magic animals, brave young princes and evil witches has come to light with the discovery of 500 new fairytales, which were locked away in an archive in Regensburg, Germany for over 150 years. The tales are part of a collection of myths, legends and fairytales, gathered by the local historian Franz Xaver von Sch\u00f6nwerth (1810\u20131886) in the Bavarian region of Oberpfalz at about the same time as the Grimm brothers were collecting the fairytales that have since charmed adults and children around the world. Last year, the Oberpfalz cultural curator Erika Eichenseer published a selection of fairytales from Von Sch\u00f6nwerth's collection, calling the book Prinz Ro\u00dfzwifl. This is local dialect for \"scarab beetle\". The scarab, also known as the \"dung beetle\", buries its most valuable possession, its eggs, in dung, which it then rolls into a ball using its back legs. Eichenseer sees this as symbolic for fairytales, which she says hold the most valuable treasure known to man: ancient knowledge and wisdom to do with human development, testing our limits and salvation. Von Sch\u00f6nwerth spent decades asking country folk, labourers and servants about local habits, traditions, customs and history, and putting down on paper what had only been passed on by word of mouth. In 1885, Jacob Grimm said this about him: \"Nowhere in the whole of Germany is anyone collecting [folklore] so accurately, thoroughly and with such a sensitive ear.\" Grimm went so far as to tell King Maximilian II of Bavaria that the only person who could replace him in his and his brother's work was Von Sch\u00f6nwerth. Von Sch\u00f6nwerth compiled his research into a book called Aus der Oberpfalz \u2013 Sitten und Sagen, which came out in three volumes in 1857, 1858 and 1859. The book never gained prominence and faded into obscurity. While sifting through Von Sch\u00f6nwerth's work, Eichenseer found 500 fairytales, many of which do not appear in other European fairytale collections. For example, there is the tale of a maiden who escapes a witch by transforming herself into a pond. The witch then lies on her stomach and drinks all the water, swallowing the young girl, who uses a knife to cut her way out of the witch. However, the collection also includes local versions of the tales children all over the world have grown up with including Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin, and which appear in many different versions across Europe. Von Sch\u00f6nwerth was a historian and recorded what he heard faithfully, making no attempt to put a literary gloss on it, which is where he differs from the Grimm brothers. However, says Eichenseer, this factual recording adds to the charm and authenticity of the material. What delights her most about the tales is that they are unpolished. \"There is no romanticising or attempt by Sch\u00f6nwerth to interpret or develop his own style,\" she says. Eichenseer says the fairytales are not for children alone. \"Their main purpose was to help young adults on their path to adulthood, showing them that dangers and challenges can be overcome through virtue, prudence and courage.\" In 2008, Eichenseer helped to found the Franz Xaver von Sch\u00f6nwerth Society, an interdisciplinary committee devoted to analysing his work and publicising it. She is keen to see the tales available in English, and a Munich-based English translator, Dan Szabo, has already begun work on stories ranging from a miserly farmer and a money-mill to a turnip princess. \"Sch\u00f6nwerth's legacy counts as the most significant collection in the German-speaking world in the 19th century,\" says Daniel Drascek, a member of the society and a professor in the faculty of language, literature and cultural sciences at the University of Regensburg.",

A list of those meetings based on the evidence given today, follows, sometimes with comments from Sir Paul or the barrister questioning him, Robert Jay QC. Sir Paul Stephenson joined the Met as deputy commissioner on 16 March 2005. Wallis was deputy editor of the News of the World. Glenn Mulcaire was arrested on 8 August 2006 in the first phone-hacking investigation (he was later jailed for four months in January 2007).

Noted in the Met's hospitality register, meaning it would have been paid for by Wallis. 2. 15 November 2007: Dinner with Wallis and Fedorcio. Robert Jay QC: \"Presumably a similar purpose as the dinner the previous year or 14 months previously; is that right?\" Stephenson: \"It would be, yes.\" 3. 20 February 2008: The \"first entry\" that year is dinner with Neil Wallis alone.

Stephenson becomes acting commissioner on 1 December 2008; he is appointed as commissioner on 28 January 2009. 5. 4 February 2009: Drinks with Wallis and Fedorcio, described as a \"business dinner\" in the Met police register. Jay: \"But again you're not going to be able to assist with what was discussed on that occasion, presumably?\" Stephenson: \"No.\" 6. 23 June 2009: Dinner with Wallis and Fedorcio at Luciano's in St James' Street. Jay: \"Do you recall anything about that occasion?\" Stephenson: \"I don't specifically recall the occasion, but if it's there in the diary and the register, then I accept that it took place.\" Neil Wallis left the NoW in August 2009 and set up his own consultancy, Chamy Media. He worked as a two-day-a-week PR adviser to the Met between October 2009 and September 2010, earning \u00a324,000, before joining Outside Organisation, a public relations company, in 2010. Stephenson says he was not involved in Wallis's recruitment in 2009, but says he was content with it. 7. 10 December 2009: Dinner with Fedorcio, Yates and Wallis.

      "bodyText": "1 The recent unprecedented street protests have terrified him It's hard to think of another public occasion when Putin has been quite this emotional. There were the tears, of course, but also several loud sniffs as he delivered his victory speech on a stage in Red Square. You can hear his voice cracking up; the pauses before several words betray the feelings of a man who is under severe strain. In his address, Putin made clear that he believes nothing less than dark forces are plotting against him. In the past, he has said that the west is behind the massive street protests that have shaken Moscow and other Russian cities. \"We really showed that no one can impose anything on us! No one!\" he shouted. He said that the ultimate goal of the demonstrators was to \"destroy Russian statehood and usurp power\". In fact, there is no evidence to support Putin's fantasy-claim that his opponents are western stooges. Rather, the demonstrators are simply fed up with Putin's corrupt system and his revelation that he had privately agreed with Dmitry Medvedev a long time ago to serve a third term in the Kremlin \u2013 regardless of whether Russian voters wanted him there or not. The demonstrators' demands are actually modest: a re-run of December's flawed poll; the freeing of political prisoners; the sacking of Russia's discredited elections' chief. Their mood isn't revolutionary. They merely want a genuinely plural political system and fair elections. The fact that Putin doesn't understand this shows he has lost touch with reality, the perennial problem of leaders everywhere who stay in power too long. 2 Kremlin spin-doctors have an explanation for everything Within minutes of Vladimir blubbing in public his spokesman came up with an ingenious explanation: it was the wind. The prime minister's lachrymose performance had nothing to do with his agitated emotional state, Dmitry Peskov said, but was the result of an icy breeze whipping over the Kremlin's historic cobbles. True, it was chilly in Moscow: temperatures were well below freezing. But the explanation clearly stretches credulity, and was of the: \"You know I'm lying, and I know I'm lying, but \u2013 hey! \u2013 that's the game\" variety. Russia's leadership has a long history of coming up with convoluted explanations to obscure an obvious truth. Sometimes, as with Putin's tears, this is funny. But on other occasions it is sinister. Whenever human rights activists and journalists are gunned down in Russia, Putin typically blames the Kremlin's enemies, arguing that the murders are carried out by his opponents in a deliberate attempt to smear the Kremlin. This wonderful but dark inverted logic runs through much of official thinking. 3 Putin's recent facelift has not been a success Speculation started last year that Putin had had some \u2013 ahem \u2013 work done in preparation for his return to the presidency. Observers noticed that the bags and wrinkles under his eyes had mysteriously vanished, and that his cheekbones had become strangely smooth. Last year the liberal New Times magazine ran an article headlined: \"What has happened with Putin's face?\". Opposition bloggers, meanwhile, began using the mocking hashtag #botox with reference to Putin. (Medvedev, for his part, got #pathetic.) Yesterday's closeup of Putin on stage surely confirms that the surgery rumours are true. His eyes seem to have shrunk, as if someone from the set of Harry Potter had stunned him from close range with a minor jinxing charm. But the old Putin looked much better, making one almost nostalgic for the days when the craggier-looking Putin skied down volcanoes, grappled with Arctic polar bears, and descended fearlessly to the bottom of a Siberian lake in a cramped submarine. 4 Political humour is back Putin's weeping has inevitably spawned dozens of jokes and playful one-liners. Twitter has broiled with mocking explanations for the PM's tears \u2013 sinusitis, onions, even an advanced squirting flower planted by the KGB. Within minutes of his speech, Russians were satirically referencing Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears, a popular 1980 Soviet film about three provincial girls who come to Moscow. Opposition activists have used the film's title on flyers for Monday's mass protests in Pushkin Square. Even US Senator John McCain has joined in, pinging the teasing tweet: Dear Vlad, Surprise! Surprise! You won. The #Russian people are crying too! This revival in humour is something recent. Although Russia has a rich tradition of political satire, it has struggled to express itself in Putin's po-faced bureaucratic Russia. One of Putin's earliest acts as president was to shut down the country's popular Spitting Image TV show, Kukly, (meaning Puppets). Kukly had offended Putin by using an old joke from a story by the German writer ETA Hoffman in which a fairy casts a spell on an ugly dwarf so that others find him irresistibly beautiful. Other spoof videos in the run-up to Sunday's election have depicted Putin as Montgomery Burns, the ageing miser from the Simpsons. Another satirises the poll as a 100-metre sprint. Putin, in the middle of the field, runs off before everyone else, shoots his opponents in the foot, and then jogs towards the tape. Vladimir Churov, Russia's election chief, helpfully brings the tape towards him. 5 The protests won't go away Putin's teary speech will infuriate protesters, for whom he is a figure of loathing and contempt. He described Sunday's poll as \"clean\" and \"honest\". This is despite widespread evidence of fraud including carousel voting and the stuffing of ballot boxes. Putin has already ruled out re-running December's flawed Duma poll and has said he's not interested in investigating violations. This is one of the protesters' key demands. He may have won on Sunday without fraud \u2013 but the question is meaningless in a political system tilted so massively in his favour. Angry demonstrators have noted that Putin's tears are in stark contrast to his usually inscrutable, and even callous-seeming, behaviour on other big public occasions. He failed to cry when children were killed during the 2004 school massacre in Beslan, or when the Kursk submarine sank. So why did he let the tears flow last night? One theory is that he had fallen victim to his own paranoia, and genuinely believed his victory wasn't a foregone conclusion. Another, more elegant, explanation is that despite his reputation as a KGB tough guy Putin can be sentimental. It was Nabokov, in his Lectures on Literature, who pointed out that Lenin had a sentimental as well as a cruel side.",

      "bodyText": "Attempts to reduce support for victims of domestic violence and to cut advice on welfare benefits are likely to provoke the largest rebellions from peers, campaigners claim, as the House of Lords begins voting today on the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. So many amendments have been tabled that the process is expected to be drawn out over five days, starting with sessions today and on Wednesday this week. Voting is expected to continue late into the evening. One of the first divisions will be on an amendment tabled by, among others, Lord Pannick and the former lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, seeking to close a potential loophole. It will impose on the government a binding duty to deliver the services that the bill permits the lord chancellor, Ken Clarke, to provide - albeit within the resources available. Less technical amendments expected to gather significant support from crossbenchers and some Liberal Democrat peers are those challenging the critieria the government will use to decide whether victims of domestic abuse are entitled to legal aid. Several amendments allow for additional types of evidence of past domestic violence to be accepted as sufficient proof that individuals deserve legal help to leave abusive relationships. On Wednesday, in the next voting session, a motion on providing legal advice for welfare benefits drafted jointly by Labour, Liberal Democrat, Conservative and crossbench peers has been attracting significant backing. A letter sent out to all members of the Lords, signed by Lord Pannick on behalf of Lords Bach, Newton and Baroness Doocey, seeks peers' endorsement. \"Without these benefits,\" the letter says, \"disabled people will find themselves at high risk of social exclusion and serious negative outcomes. \"Just as importantly, cuts to welfare benefits advice will not yield the savings the Ministry of Justice hopes to make. In their impact assessment, they accept the possibility of 'increased costs for other departments', but do not quantify those costs. These knock on costs were confirmed by Kings College in their report Unintended Consequences (Jan 2012). \"Citizens Advice analysis says that for every \u00a31 spent on welfare benefits advice the state potentially saves \u00a38.80. The government have not refuted these numbers. \"We are not writing to you as politicians or with any partisan intent. We represent all sections of this House and between us we have experience as a former secretary of state for social security and chair of the Council on Tribunals, a former legal aid minister, a public law and human rights barrister, and a former chair of the London Assembly. So in our different ways we have all seen the value this sort of advice brings to individuals, society and the state.\" The lobby group Justice for All called on peers to support the amendment. \"With significant upheaval to the benefits system, high numbers of disabled people being wrongly found fit for work, and with good evidence that advice on these issues actually saves money, it's absolutely vital that specialist advice is still available in this area,\" the organisation said. \"Keeping it within legal aid is the only way to guarantee this. As the only amendment with endorsement from across the House, we hope it attracts widespread support from all parties.\"",

      "bodyText": "January 1995 New job! I am officially a horse of the Metropolitan police. It's a respectable career, with an excellent pension scheme. It's never too soon to start thinking about retirement. I have been assigned to the riot squad. My friend Dobson says I am a feminist pioneer. Dobson is livid because he has been assigned to the royals, and he is a republican. 9 April 1995 First riot! Football fans \u2013 Manchester United and Crystal Palace. All the old hooves were rolling their eyes \u2013 football is notorious for it, apparently. I hated it. I don't like crowds or aggro, and the singing is terrible. I didn't even get to see the Crystal Palace. Wish I was on royals. They've got palaces coming out of their ears. 6 September 1997 Can't believe I have been on the riot squad for over two years now. Have learned nothing, and my hearing is starting to go. Today we were loaned out for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. Weird to be among so many people and not have to use water cannon. Even Dobson had a tear in his eye, though he claimed it was hayfever. I thought wistfully about the career I might have had. If Diana'd been on horseback in Paris, everything would have been very different. Thinking of writing a letter to this effect to the Daily Express. 9 May 1998 Eurovision held in the UK for the first time in years! Alas, nobody riots, so we don't get to go. 18 June 1999 Anti-capitalist riots in central London. I could tell these rioters a thing or two about Marxism. You know a lot about the exploitation of the workers by the ruling class when you are literally saddled beneath government officials day in, day out. I suggest to the other horses that we switch sides. They openly mock me. They have no class consciousness. 1 January 2000 Happy new millennium! Was on crowd control duty last night so I got to watch the fireworks. Bit underwhelming. Wish I lived in Sydney. Millennium Dome officially opened by the Queen. Dobson says even Her Maj was struggling to contain her indifference. 1 May 2001 Third year of anti-capitalist riots. Every horse in the Met tries to get leave. 3 July 2002 Party in the palace for the Queen's Jubilee. Dobson tells me that Brian May played guitar on the roof. There was a time I would have been sad to have missed this. I am embarrassed by my younger self. 16 February 2003 Huge demonstration against the invasion of Iraq. I brace myself for the worst but it is impossibly well-behaved. Overhear many conversations about organic food delivery boxes. 7 July 2005 A series of bombs on the tube and a bus remind me that I should take my job more seriously and stop spending so much time complaining that the Perspex eye mask gives me a headache. Dead and injured everywhere. Londoners behave impeccably and I am proud to be British. But I realise how tired I am of riot work. You see the very worst humanity has to offer. 20 January 2006 A whale is discovered in the Thames. I dream of swimming far away. But I can't swim my way across oceans, I am a horse. Apparently neither can the whale. 2008 It is announced that our final salary pension scheme has been closed. My 13 years of contributions are worth nothing. A blackness descends. When I emerge from this dark place, I hear that I am now considered \"traumatised\" by my time in the riot squad, and am being forcibly retired. My new home is in Chipping Norton with Charlie Brooks, a racehorse trainer, and his wife Rebekah, the editor the News of the World. What kind of retirement is this? I've spent 13 years having shop windows smashed in my face, stones thrown at me, and listening to speeches by George Galloway, but nothing has prepared me for Rebekah, known as Becher's Brooks by the racehorses because of her deadly riding style. 2009 Whenever the Brookses have friends to stay, all the horses freak out, because God knows who you're going to end up with on your back. The Murdochs and Freuds are generally OK, but all the horses dread Clarkson. He never goes for me, though, because he only cares about speed. I always end up with fleshpot Cameron. He says he likes having the police under his control for a change. According to stable gossip, he and Rebekah chat as they ride, but frustratingly the sound of hooves on the road drowns out any conversation. If only there were some other way to eavesdrop. 2010 I am literally knackered from Brooks and co's terrible riding. The Brookses send me back to Scotland Yard. It is humiliating. The other horses threw me a huge retirement do when I left, and I've lost the gold watch they gave me. Everyone keeps asking me why I'm not wearing it. After Raisa was returned to the Met in an allegedly \"poor\" condition, she was refostered to a home in Norfolk, where she subsequently died of natural causes.

      "body": "<p><strong>January 1995</strong></p> <p>New job! I am officially a horse of the Metropolitan police. It's a respectable career, with an excellent pension scheme. It's never too soon to start thinking about retirement. I have been assigned to the riot squad. My friend Dobson says I am a feminist pioneer. Dobson is livid because he has been assigned to the royals, and he is a republican.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> <strong>April 1995</strong></p> <p>First riot! Football fans \u2013 Manchester United and Crystal Palace. All the old hooves were rolling their eyes \u2013 football is notorious for it, apparently. I hated it. I don't like crowds or aggro, and the singing is terrible. I didn't even get to see the Crystal Palace. Wish I was on royals. They've got palaces coming out of their ears.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> <strong>September 1997</strong></p> <p>Can't believe I have been on the riot squad for over two years now. Have learned nothing, and my hearing is starting to go. Today we were loaned out for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. Weird to be among so many people and not have to use water cannon. Even Dobson had a tear in his eye, though he claimed it was hayfever. I thought wistfully about the career I might have had. If Diana'd been on horseback in Paris, everything would have been very different. Thinking of writing a letter to this effect to the Daily Express.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> <strong>May 1998</strong></p> <p>Eurovision held in the UK for the first time in years! Alas, nobody riots, so we don't get to go.</p> <p><strong>18</strong> <strong>June 1999</strong></p> <p>Anti-capitalist riots in central London. I could tell these rioters a thing or two about Marxism. You know a lot about the exploitation of the workers by the ruling class when you are literally saddled beneath government officials day in, day out. I suggest to the other horses that we switch sides. They openly mock me. They have no class consciousness.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> <strong>January 2000</strong></p> <p>Happy new millennium! Was on crowd control duty last night so I got to watch the fireworks. Bit underwhelming. Wish I lived in Sydney. Millennium Dome officially opened by the Queen. Dobson says even Her Maj was struggling to contain her indifference.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> <strong>May 2001</strong></p> <p>Third year of anti-capitalist riots. Every horse in the Met tries to get leave.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> <strong>July 2002</strong></p> <p>Party in the palace for the Queen's Jubilee. Dobson tells me that Brian May played guitar on the roof. There was a time I would have been sad to have missed this. I am embarrassed by my younger self.</p> <p><strong>16</strong> <strong>February 2003</strong></p> <p>Huge demonstration against the invasion of Iraq. I brace myself for the worst but it is impossibly well-behaved. Overhear many conversations about organic food delivery boxes.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> <strong>July 2005</strong></p> <p>A series of bombs on the tube and a bus remind me that I should take my job more seriously and stop spending so much time complaining that the Perspex eye mask gives me a headache. Dead and injured everywhere. Londoners behave impeccably and I am proud to be British. But I realise how tired I am of riot work. You see the very worst humanity has to offer.</p> <p><strong>20</strong> <strong>January 2006</strong></p> <p>A whale is discovered in the Thames. I dream of swimming far away. But I can't swim my way across oceans, I am a horse. Apparently neither can the whale.</p> <p><strong>2008</strong></p> <p>It is announced that our final salary pension scheme has been closed. My 13 years of contributions are worth nothing. A blackness descends. When I emerge from this dark place, I hear that I am now considered \"traumatised\" by my time in the riot squad, and am being forcibly retired.</p> <p>My new home is in Chipping Norton with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/02/david-cameron-police-horse-rebekah-brooks\" title=\"\">Charlie Brooks, a racehorse trainer, and his wife Rebekah, the editor the News of the World</a>. What kind of retirement is this? I've spent 13 years having shop windows smashed in my face, stones thrown at me, and listening to speeches by George Galloway, but nothing has prepared me for Rebekah, known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becher%27s_Brook\" title=\"\">Becher's Brook</a>s by the racehorses because of her deadly riding style.</p> <p><strong>2009</strong></p> <p>Whenever the Brookses have friends to stay, all the horses freak out, because God knows who you're going to end up with on your back. The Murdochs and Freuds are generally OK, but all the horses dread <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jeremyclarkson\" title=\"\">Clarkson</a>. He never goes for me, though, because he only cares about speed. I always end up with fleshpot Cameron. He says he likes having the police under his control for a change. According to stable gossip, he and Rebekah chat as they ride, but frustratingly the sound of hooves on the road drowns out any conversation. If only there were some other way to eavesdrop.</p> <p><strong>2010</strong></p> <p>I am literally knackered from Brooks and co's terrible riding. The Brookses send me back to Scotland Yard. It is humiliating. The other horses threw me a huge retirement do when I left, and I've lost the gold watch they gave me. Everyone keeps asking me why I'm not wearing it.</p> <p><em>After Raisa was returned to the Met in an allegedly \"poor\" condition, she was refostered to a home in Norfolk, where she subsequently died of natural causes. In 2011, her friend Dobson demonstrated his contempt for the monarchy by throwing his rider and bolting during the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton.

      "bodyText": "We are about to embark on a ragged trail through a number of publications that in recent days have led me to muse on what a university is for and the qualities a university education should seek to engender in its students. Following the publication of his book 'What are universities for?' Stefan Collini contributed an opinion piece on the subject to the Guardian. I read this with the mixture of hope that one might bring to an article entitled \"does God exist\" or \"how to achieve true happiness\". Stefan Collini writes: \"Should they be businesses 'competing on price'? Are students 'consumers', concerned only with getting jobs? A half-baked market ideology informs official thinking about higher education, and it undermines an ideal that a vast number of people cherish.\" Cue the Wilson Report, published a few days later, which looks at how collaboration between universities and businesses can be improved. It opens with a quote from Lord Dearing in 2002: \"Just as castles provided the source of strength for medieval towns, and factories provided prosperity in the industrial age, universities are the source of strength in the knowledge-based economy of the twenty-first century.\" The Wilson review speaks of universities as part of a complex \"skills and innovation supply chain to business\" which one imagines would have Prof Collini pursing his lips like a prune. The review comes up with more than 50 recommendations including measures to improve the employability of graduates by reviving sandwich courses and expanding opportunities for internships. So here we have thesis (universities are not about markets, business and student employability) and anti-thesis (oh yes they are). Sure enough a few days later came synthesis in the unlikely guise of a consultation on new guidance from the Quality Assurance Agency. This looks at how universities and academics can promote enterprise and entrepreneurship as part of their teaching and how this might be properly assessed. I'm particularly struck by the section describing the \"behaviours, attributes and skills\" that should be demonstrated by an enterprising and entrepreneurial student. The document says that students should be able to: \u2022 Recognise and achieve goals and ambitions, especially in response to challenge (goals and ambitions) \u2022 Enhance self-confidence and belief through practice of enterprising skills and behaviours (self-confidence) \u2022 Demonstrate perseverance, resilience and determination to achieve goals, especially within challenging situations (perseverance) \u2022 Recognise that they are in control of their own destiny (internal locus of control) and use this understanding effectively within enterprising situations \u2022 Take action and learn both from actions and active experimentation (action orientation) \u2022 Innovate and offer creative solutions to challenging and complex problems (innovation and creativity). It seems to me that these are that characteristics that any education establishment should be seeking to encourage and create among all its students. They are the characteristics of a mature, well balanced and questioning intelligence. They aren't just the marks of someone who would be a good employee. They are the marks of a good democrat, a good parent, a person who is capable of happiness and contributing to the happiness of others. At which point, I return to Stefan Collini who ends his quest for the purpose of universities with a quote from the American social critic Thorstein Veblen published a book entitled The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Businessmen, in which he declared: \"Ideally, and in the popular apprehension, the university is, as it has always been, a corporation for the cultivation and care of the community's highest aspirations and ideals.\" I think it's difficult to improve on that definition of a university and I don't think it's at all inconsistent with improving collaboration with businesses or turning out graduates who are well rounded individuals capable of employing themselves or that people want to employ.

No, not the fact it's full of tedious stadium yawn-alongs, but rather that nobody can pronounce the damn title. Martin moaned that the band had named their fifth studio effort after \"two words that you couldn't even google\" and apparently it's causing fans headaches. Coldplay aren't the first band to suffer from naming regret. British Sea Power recently confessed that their biggest career mistake was their name \u2013 apparently the imperialist connotations destroyed record sales in France. Elsewhere, rock journalist Steven Wells once raved about the band the Muslims based purely on their name. The band weren't quite as ballsy \u2013 they reverted to the somewhat-less-gripping the Soft Pack. The band Girls were braver, sticking with their name despite the fact nobody could find them on Google; you were more likely to stumble upon an adult entertainment website but, as the band told me, \"at least you can write great headlines like 'Girls gone wild'\". Actually, Martin is wrong to doubt the google-ability of Mylo Xyloto \u2013 the made-up title, apparently a vague reference to musical fingers and toes, is perfect for Google as nothing else comes up when you search for it. Although perhaps only a journalist with a stupid Z in his surname would realise that.",

Martin moaned that the band had named their fifth studio effort after \"two words that you couldn't even google\" and apparently it's causing fans headaches.</p> <p>Coldplay aren't the first band to suffer from naming regret. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/british-sea-power\" title=\"\">British Sea Power</a> recently confessed that their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jan/16/british-sea-power-interview-valhalla-dancehall\" title=\"\">biggest career mistake was their name</a> \u2013 apparently the imperialist connotations destroyed record sales in France. Elsewhere, rock journalist Steven Wells once raved about the band the Muslims based purely on their name. The band weren't quite as ballsy \u2013 they <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2008/dec/03/muslims-soft-pack\" title=\"\">reverted to the somewhat-less-gripping the Soft Pack</a>.</p> <p>The band Girls were braver, sticking with their name despite the fact nobody could find them on Google; you were more likely to stumble upon an adult entertainment website but, as the band told me, \"at least you can write great headlines like 'Girls gone wild'\".</p> <p>Actually, Martin is wrong to doubt the google-ability of Mylo Xyloto \u2013 the made-up title, apparently a vague reference to musical fingers and toes, is perfect for Google as nothing else comes up when you search for it. Although perhaps only a journalist with a&#xa0;stupid Z in his surname would&#xa0;realise that.</p>",

The excitement starts with demonstrating the butterfly effect - a rare purple species flutters its wings, alerting a rabbit which goes on to startle a horse; this reels off in an interesting turn of events which affect lots of different people in the world; including a middle-aged flight attendant, an eighteen-year-old mountain climber, and two armed young boys. This book is interesting because there is no main character, but lots of different people very loosely affected. There is also no clear villain or enemy, making for a very different main plot. Although these people are completely random, we sympathise with them and become engrossed in their separate tales, wondering how they will be portrayed in the ending. Matt Dickinson is a very talented writer, and has the ability to capture the minds of both young and old people; an impressive feat for the 21st-century author.

      "bodyText": "A short stroll through Doha, the capital of Qatar, is a jarring experience for the new visitor accustomed to walking without hindrance through his or her neighbourhood. Construction cranes soar all over the city's newly rising skyscrapers while dust and sand spill onto pavements and roads. Pavements are often lacking and crossing Doha's streets feels dangerous: roaring SUVs and sports cars show little mercy for pedestrians who dare to use the crossings or are mad enough to jaywalk. And walking into one of the city's sparkling shopping centres or five star hotels reveals massive fountains and, at the Doha City Centre mall, an ice skating rink. Odd sights, indeed, for a country that relies on desalination for water and where the mercury creeps towards 50\u00b0 during the summer. So locals and expatriates do not walk: they leave that to the naive first-time visitor. Cars reign. Welcome to Qatar, the country that has both the highest per capita income and the highest per capita carbon footprint on Earth. A barren desert a generation ago, Qatar at first glance has leveraged its overflowing petroleum and natural gas wealth for the benefit of its 300,000 citizens. The government generously invests in education, and the Qatar Foundation funds countless programmes in the sciences, culture and social welfare. Citizens enjoy free water and electricity and the 1.5 million expatriates pay little for these basic services. Petrol, of course, is cheap. And therein lurk problems if Qatar is ever to become a genuinely sustainable society. Citizens, and even expatriates, have little incentive to mind their water and fuel consumption. Excess is the norm, from supermarket clerks placing only two or three items in supermarket bags to the obvious food waste at the posh restaurants that line Doha's Souq Waqif. Driving through neighbourhoods at night reveal gleaming villas that boast more lights turned on than off. Trash is everywhere, even in remote patches of the desert I explored on my last day in Qatar. In fairness, Qatar has developed in two decades to a point that took the West over two centuries. And Qatar is slowly starting to turn a corner. Qatar's National Vision 2030 plan, which makes slight calls for sound environmental management, is a step. I spoke with Issa Al Mohannadi, CEO of Msheireb Properties and chair of the Qatar Green Building Council. He pointed out that Qatar is sixth in the world in green buildings (earning it another global highest per capita rate). To that end, Msheireb is building a 31 hectare site in downtown Doha that will feature platinum-certified LEED buildings and ones that incorporate the traditional Arabian architectural elements that allowed Qataris to survive the desert in the first place. \"We have to develop a new architectural language and keep the identity of the past,\" said Al Mohannadi. Msheireb's features include thick walls, narrow zig-zagging alleys that allow buildings to shade each other and structures oriented at 45 degrees to maximise winds. Watch for Msheireb and other projects that could transform Doha into a green building laboratory, critical if Doha's infrastructure is to support Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup. Billions of dollars worth of rail and solar projects are also underway. And Qatar will soon start harnessing its abundant sun to good use. One initiative for a post-oil Qatar is a $1bn (\u00a3632m) polysilicon manufacturing facility; with Doha's focus on becoming a convention and sporting events hub, the tiny country will have plenty of demand for its new solar power stations. For young entrepreneurs like Amr Belal, the future in solar and green building is one that shines brightly. The Egyptian American has worked in Qatar for six years running the solar installation company, Innovations Unlimited, which currently has 20 employees and is growing. Belal explained says he feels bullish about clean energy's future here. Qatar has a long way to go before it heals its environment, but for sustainability professionals, plenty of opportunities abound in this tiny thumb of land that juts into the Arabian Gulf.

On the right, the enterprise is the key, harnessing the entrepreneurial spirit of ordinary people, whilst on the left the social purpose of the initiative is what defines it. Social enterprise clearly ticks both boxes and as such deserves broad support in terms of the awarding of contracts, political encouragement and a fair share of investment funds. There is the rub. While several excellent examples of social enterprises making the grade exist, the market is frighteningly small; Britain saw just \u00a3165 million of institutional social investment in 2010 according to the Young Foundation, most of that being provided by just four bodies. This is a drop in the ocean compared to, for example, charitable giving. It is thought that the combined turnover of all social enterprises in Britain is already over \u00a320 billion. At the same time, two thirds of all investments in UK social enterprise are under \u00a35,000 which is not institutional investor territory. Most social enterprises utilise an asset lock of some kind to prevent ownership of the enterprise passing into the hands of someone who will strip the assets or change the purpose of the organisation, further discouraging conventional investors. Just five per cent of investment in social enterprise involves equity transfer. The Circle Partnership, incidentally, which recently took over the NHS hospital at Hinchingbrooke, does manage to have the best of both worlds. It is 49 per cent owned by a 'John Lewis'-style partnership of medics who run it from day to day and 51 per cent by financial institutions operating on a traditional for-profit basis. In the golden years of the Big Society, 2010-11, it was naturally assumed that social enterprise would step in and take over as thousands of opportunities arose through the outsourcing of public, and especially council, services. But the bodies that represent social enterprise were rightly wary - it would take three to five years to build the necessary capacity, they argued, and even that would rely on three things: a degree of positive discrimination, access to copious funds and a more benign legislative framework. One barrier to this capacity building is cost: compliance with financial services regulation can generate costs of tens of thousands of pounds which puts accessing investment on the modest scale required beyond the reach of most social enterprises. Amendments to the current Financial Services Bill would have addressed one of these three requirements but were rejected by the Conservative / Lib Dem coalition on March 1. Amendment 72 would have placed a 'social investment duty' on the financial investment regulator to carry out its work in a way which promotes the development of social finance and social investment; and amendment 73 would have required it to establish a 'social investment panel' of persons with knowledge and expertise in social finance and social investment which it would be obliged to consult and have regard to in the conduct of its activities. Despite being entirely consistent with the words of other ministers at other times, and the spirit of the Social Value Bill which entered the statute book in the same week, the cost-free measures were rejected. Although supported by the widest possible consensus within the third sector and the social investment community ministers chose to oppose them. Whatever your politics, if social enterprise is indeed to be part of the answer to the challenge of delivering the services of the future then the loss of these measures is a real setback.

      "bodyText": "This year marks the 100th anniversary of John Cage's birth, the 20th anniversary of his death, and 11 years since the commencement of the longest concert in history \u2013 a performance of Cage's ASLSP (As Slow As Possible), played on the organ of an abandoned church in Halberstadt, which is scheduled to continue for a further 628 years. The opening weekend of the fifth AV festival, subtitled As Slow As Possible, paid tribute to Cage with a series of works of punishing duration. Film-maker and composer Phill Niblock is known for extremely loud, extremely long drone concerts presented in his New York loft, where listeners are free to move around experiencing the throb of slowly shifting frequencies. Yet the impulse to wander at the Sage was curtailed by the rows of chairs, which slightly diminished the impact of a three-note electric guitar duet performed by Susan Stenger and Robert Poss against an inscrutable film backdrop of manual workers fishing, threshing and harvesting. Yoshi Wada is a Japanese jazz saxophonist who went to New York in the 1960s to work as a plumber, fell under the influence of the Fluxus movement, and developed a passion for bagpipes. His Lament for John Cage pitted the distorted guitars of Stenger and Poss against three kilted members of the City of Newcastle Pipeband in a curious work that sounded at times like a confrontation between a highland marching regiment and the Velvet Underground. Cage's ponderous meditation on a Zen garden, Ryoanji, and the meandering harp improvisation Postcard from Heaven were given reverential treatment. Yet the composer's subversive humour only really emerged in a recitation by poet Kenneth Goldsmith of Cage's famous lecture on nothing: \"I have nothing to say, and I am saying it, and that is poetry.\"",

Not in terms of its concept: a super-observant chap, pretending to be psychic, helps the police solve crimes, is an idea that formed the backbone of the successfully silly Psych a couple of years earlier. But in terms of its delivery, it is a show which consistently, and unusually, gets better with time. This is because the pitch a writer needs to sell a show, and the hook which makes the show watchable week after week are not always the same thing. Tell us what makes this show different, the TV execs will demand, and we end up with an angelically handsome man, finely skilled in the arts of illusion, hypnosis, psychology and tea-drinking from a cup and saucer, while wearing a waistcoat. But that isn't enough, so he also has to have a personal tragedy which motivates him. (In this case, Patrick Jane is hoping to capture and murder the serial killer Red John, who killed Jane's wife and child after Jane insulted him on a TV show. Serial killers can be petty that way). Cleverly, The Mentalist writers have realised that their audience isn't watching for the eventual showdown between Jane and Red John; instead we're watching for the weekly murder mystery. And we're especially watching to see Jane work with the rest of the California Bureau of Investigation unit \u2013 the almost perpetually down-in-the-mouth Lisbon, the uber-deadpan Cho, the steely yet emotional Van Pelt, and the other one, Rigsby. Common to the team is a sense of sacrifice: Cho is brusque with Summer, the prostitute-turned-informant for whom he clearly has the hots, because he's afraid to risk her safety (S4, ep14). Lisbon was prepared to fake a mental breakdown to catch a killer (S2, ep 3). Grace gunned down her own fianc\u00e9 when he turned out to be evil (S3, ep 23), and Rigsby was taller than the others, and maybe once worked in arson (S1, ep 9). The focus on our gang's shifting dynamic doesn't mean the writers aren't having fun with the Red John storyline too \u2013 the finale of Season 3, where Jane meets a man he believes to be his nemesis is genuinely brilliant. As Lisbon hits redial on the phone belonging to Red John's lackey, a ringing sound peals out behind Jane. It is, of course, picked up by Bradley Whitford, and any happy residual memory of The West Wing disintegrates as he tells Jane that his murdered daughter smelled of sweat, and strawberries and cream. Simon Baker is terrific as Jane, the urbane, charming, yet ultimately tragic hero. And his pay cheque proves it \u2013 he's one of the highest-paid actors in a drama series in the world. Sitcom actors may earn more, but since Baker also has the almost unique pleasure of wearing a waistcoat and not looking like a massive tit, he wins. Iconic: Sure. The tea-drinking, the curly hair.

      "bodyText": "The high profile launch in the UK last week of the US-based wine club Lot18, is the latest attempt to wean us off our bargain basement supermarket buying habits. Describing itself as a \"members only marketplace offering access to unmatched deals on rare and hard-to-find wines\" it claims to have attracted nearly one million members in the US since its launch in 2010 with \"thousands more joining every day\". Its USP is that it only offers a limited number of wines at any time on a WIGIG (when it's gone it's gone) basis. But of the 8 wines on offer on launch day last Friday there were only two which I couldn't easily find elsewhere: a Flores de Callejo Ribera del Duero and a Inglenook Rubicon Estate Blancaneaux 2009, a white Rhone-style Californian wine from the winery of Francis Ford Coppola which was on offer at two bottles for \u00a385. Hardly cheap but then Calfornian wines are pricey and scarce in the UK, so fair do's. All the other wines were widely available at less than the price that Lot 18 are charging, never mind what they quote as the normal retail price. Chateau Pontet Canet '95, for example, one of the opening offers, was priced at \u00a390 instead of \u00a3125 but is available on the website of Northern Ireland wine merchant James Nicholson for \u00a369. A company called WineBear has single bottles of the Sesti Phenomena Brunello di Montalcino Riserva 2004 that Lot 18 was selling for \u00a390 for \u00a363.24 and you can pay even less than that at Harper Wells - \u00a357.85 - if you buy six. Lot 18 claims the retail price from which their reduction is made is \u00a3110. You can buy Churchill's Late Bottled Vintage port 2003 for which Lot 18 was charging \u00a316 (down from \u00a320) at \u00a311.80 currently at slurp.co.uk, which also says the normal price is only \u00a315.60 - less than Lot 18's offer price. All this serves as a timely reminder that as with food, you pay a price for convenience with wine. For example, a number of other online wine clubs and merchants have what appear to be attractive offers on mixed cases, but it's far from clear what you're getting. It's hard to detect the vintages on Avery's \"best-selling ros\u00e9 collection\" online but a catalogue I've been sent shows that most are from the 2009 vintage and a couple from 2008 - quite long in the tooth for a wine that's supposed to be drunk fresh. The same is true of a 2008 Australian Chardonnay Viognier currently being offered as part of Tesco's Fruity Whites case. Nor are Lot18 the only retailer to offer \"limited-time opportunities to purchase directly from wineries\". That is also true of From Vineyards Direct and the most innovative recent entrant to the market, Naked Wines, which encourages their customers - or \"angels\" as they call them - to \"invest in independent winemakers in return for exclusive wines at preferential prices\". \"You squirrel away \u00a320 a month into your account towards your next order, yours to spend whenever you want\" they continue cosily. But if you ordered an \"Ultimate Dinner Party Case\" from Naked Wines would you expect it to include a blush pinot grigio? The fact is that almost all these schemes have their downsides. The UK market is already full of sophisticated operators saving you the trouble of having to think about wine so it's hard to see where Lot18, apart from its access to hard-to-find Californian wines, breaks new ground. Check any deal a wine club is offering on Google or wine-searcher.com. Do you - would you - buy wine from a wine club, and what's your experience been of them?",

      "bodyText": "Royal wedding fever sparked a record number of visits to Westminster Abbey last year, propelling it into the top 10 most-visited attractions in the UK for the first time, new figures reveal. The Abbey welcomed nearly 1.9 million overseas and domestic visitors in 2011, up 36% on 2010, according to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva). Millions of TV viewers watched the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the 700-year-old building in April. In contrast, St Paul's cathedral, where protesters set up an anti-capitalism camp, saw visitor numbers dip 4% to just under 1.82 million. Attractions in rural areas also struggled, Alva said, not because of the quality or attractiveness of the properties but due to the punitive price of petrol. The Tower of London welcomed nearly 6% more visitors last year, at 2.55 million, while National Portrait Gallery visitors rose 3% to 1.88 million. The British Museum retained the top slot as the UK's most visited attraction with 5.85 million visitors, a modest increase of 0.1% on the previous year. Overall, new museums and those that ploughed money into refurbishment reaped the benefits by pulling in large crowds. The National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, for example, saw a 141% increase in visitors last year, one of the biggest increases of any attraction. It reopened fully in July after a \u00a347m development and welcomed nearly 1.5 million visitors, achieving its original target of one million in less than four months. Visitor numbers rose 22% at the National Maritime Museum, which opened the \u00a335m Sammy Ofer wing in July. The Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich saw a 31% increase in visitor numbers, helped partly by its starring role in films including The Iron Lady and Pirates of the Caribbean. But there was a steep decline (down 44.2% to 879,550) at the observatory at Greenwich, which introduced a \u00a37 charge last year for access to the courtyard with the meridian line and the historic observatory, Flamsteed House. Visits to the Natural History Museum in London rose nearly 5% to 4.87 million, while the nearby Science Museum saw visitor numbers rise 6% to 2.91 million, its highest number since current records began in 1992. Bernard Donoghue, director of Alva, said: \"The figures demonstrate that for Brits who holidayed at home in record numbers last year and for overseas visitors who came to the UK in record numbers last year, our iconic attractions are a must-see and a must-experience.\" He said that even at a time of economic restraint, \"those attractions which have invested in refurbishment, new exhibitions, new marketing, new catering and retail products have seen a real return on investment and more money for the visitor economy. Domestic visitors have prioritised visits to free attractions but not exclusively; they are mindful of getting value for money and experiencing great quality, and they are finding plenty of examples of both.\" Two English Heritage properties saw a significant increase in their visitor figures. Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, which completed the first phase of a 20-year restoration project in August, welcomed nearly 90,000 people, and visitors to Wroxeter Roman City in Shropshire rose 177% after it was featured on the Channel 4 series Rome Wasn't Built in a Day. Attractions that suffered in relatively remote locations included Penryhn Castle, between Snowdonia and the Menai strait in Wales, where visitor numbers fell 35% to 149,118.",

      "bodyText": "Exams do strange things to people. When confronted with an empty piece of paper and a time limit, slackers can thrive and swots founder. For law students \u2013 who are required to memorise hundreds of case names and are assessed not just by written tests but through intimidating oral assessments \u2013 the pressure is particularly intense. The difference between doing a Cherie Blair (who finished top in her bar exams) and a Mr Justice Andrew McFarlane (the only member of the Court of Appeal with a third class degree) can hinge on avoiding the sort of mistakes several senior figures in the world of legal education highlighted to me. Accept your fate As adversarial types, law students aren't short of gripes, but one trumps all the others: the requirement by universities and providers of the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) that students learn off by heart the names of the major precedent-setting cases of English and Welsh common law. \"Given that practising lawyers aren't expected to have all these cases in their heads, it doesn't seem like a particularly productive use of time to memorise names,\" says Cat Pond, a student at the College of Law in London who completed her GDL last year, summing up the sentiment. \"Maybe it would be more sensible for the law schools to provide us with a case list that we could take into exams.\" Unfortunately for students, law lecturers tend to have little time for such arguments. \"Medical students have to remember the names of different bits of the body; history students have to do the same with kings and queens' names; law students have to know the names of cases \u2013 it's not that much to ask,\" says Steven Vaughan, director of undergraduate studies at Cardiff Law School. \"Far better to be able to write R v Wilson (1996),\" he continues, \"than 'the one where the man branded his initials onto his wife's bum'\". Apply rather than unload \"Often students feel cheated if they don't have chance in an exam to get across all the little details they have learned during their revision. They really have to fight that,\" says the head of Kaplan Law School, Giles Proctor. Proctor is keen to impress that memorisation is just the first step. \"What students are really being tested on in exams is their ability to analyse and evaluate. They need to ask themselves what the law is actually trying to say, and show appreciation of the fact that an issue is often a shade of grey rather than black and white,\" he adds. Realise that time limits are part of the challenge A common source of frustration among law school lecturers is students' tendency to underestimate the seriousness of failing to complete an exam. \"It really is surprising how many students miss out whole questions on their exam papers, particularly on the Legal Practice Course (LPC) where there are a lot of short questions designed to emulate situations faced by lawyers in private practice,\" recounts Paul McConnell, LPC course leader at the College of Law's Birmingham branch. And contrary to what some may think, if a student doesn't finish an exam in time there really is nothing they can do to make it better. \"For the record, writing a little note at the end of your paper to say sorry that you ran out of time, signed with a smiley face, doesn't make a difference,\" says Cardiff Law School's Vaughan. Select a law school that plays to your strengths The way law students are assessed differs between institutions. For example, certain LPC providers, such as the College of Law, prefer open book exams; others, like BPP Law School, veer the other way. Another variable is exam lengths. As I explained earlier this week on my blog, Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) students at City University have recently expressed dissatisfaction about the fact that they are allowed just three and a half hours to complete their opinion writing exam, while their counterparts at Northumbria University get a near-transatlantic flight length five hours. Keep your head during oral assessments The capacity of exams to make people behave weirdly is at its most pronounced during the advocacy tests LPC and BPTC students must undergo. Assessors say coming across as jittery is as much of a danger as appearing overly keen to be seen as calm and in control. A City University BPTC tutor told me a great story about a student who brought a plate of biscuits into his oral 'conference skills' assessment and offered it to the actor playing the role of the client. \"Nervousness can manifest itself in strange ways,\" reflected the tutor. The requirement that students \"establish good rapport\" with the 'client' during the oral LPC assessment, and \"maintain rapport throughout interview\" while remaining \"attentive, understanding, showing empathy, and maintaining appropriate eye contact\" is enough to put even the calmest individual on edge. \"It's quite unnerving \u2013 and also rather subjective,\" says Pond. Of course, for some students \u2013 particularly the wannabe barristers \u2013 the oral assessments are what law is all about. \"I really enjoy them,\" says Jack Harris, a BPTC student at City University. His advice to those who don't? \"It helps if you have some previous experience of public speaking.\" Be ready for the unexpected Last week a fire alarm went off two thirds of the way through the three-hour business law and practice exam at Liverpool John Moores University. The opportunity the students had to speak to each other outside the exam hall after they were evacuated meant that they weren't allowed to return to their papers, and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) consulted by the university for advice. Some of the students affected feared they might be required to resit, and a student who had been in the exam told me that she felt \"annoyed and in limbo.\" Happily, though, having considered the matter, the SRA have decided to upscale students' marks using what they describe as \"a complicated mathematical formula to ensure all are treated fairly\".

They need to ask themselves what the law is actually trying to say, and show appreciation of the fact that an issue is often a shade of grey rather than black and white,\" he adds.</p> <p><strong>Realise that time limits are part of the challenge</strong></p> <p>A common source of frustration among law school lecturers is students' tendency to underestimate the seriousness of failing to complete an exam. \"It really is surprising how many students miss out whole questions on their exam papers, particularly on the Legal Practice Course (LPC) where there are a lot of short questions designed to emulate situations faced by lawyers in private practice,\" recounts Paul McConnell, LPC course leader at the College of Law's Birmingham branch.</p> <p>And contrary to what some may think, if a student doesn't finish an exam in time there really is nothing they can do to make it better. \"For the record, writing a little note at the end of your paper to say sorry that you ran out of time, signed with a smiley face, doesn't make a difference,\" says Cardiff Law School's Vaughan.</p> <p><strong>Select a law school that plays to your strengths</strong></p> <p>The way law students are assessed differs between institutions. For example, certain LPC providers, such as the College of Law, prefer open book exams; others, like BPP Law School, veer the other way. Another variable is exam lengths. As I <a href=\"http://www.legalcheek.com/2012/02/bptc-providers-wildly-differing-exam-lengths-provoke-unfairness-accusations/\" title=\"\">explained</a> earlier this week on my blog, Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) students at City University have recently expressed dissatisfaction about the fact that they are allowed just three and a half hours to complete their opinion writing exam, while their counterparts at Northumbria University get a near-transatlantic flight length five hours.</p> <p><strong>Keep your head during oral assessments</strong></p> <p>The capacity of exams to make people behave weirdly is at its most pronounced during the advocacy tests LPC and BPTC students must undergo. Assessors say coming across as jittery is as much of a danger as appearing overly keen to be seen as calm and in control. A City University BPTC tutor told me a great story about a student who brought a plate of biscuits into his oral 'conference skills' assessment and offered it to the actor playing the role of the client. \"Nervousness can manifest itself in strange ways,\" reflected the tutor.</p> <p>The requirement that students \"establish good rapport\" with the 'client' during the oral LPC assessment, and \"maintain rapport throughout interview\" while remaining \"attentive, understanding, showing empathy, and maintaining appropriate eye contact\" is enough to put even the calmest individual on edge. \"It's quite unnerving \u2013 and also rather subjective,\" says Pond.</p> <p>Of course, for some students \u2013 particularly the wannabe barristers \u2013 the oral assessments are what law is all about. \"I really enjoy them,\" says Jack Harris, a BPTC student at City University. His advice to those who don't? \"It helps if you have some previous experience of public speaking.\"</p> <p><strong>Be ready for the unexpected</strong></p> <p>Last week a <a href=\"http://www.legalcheek.com/2012/02/exclusive-fire-alarm-causes-lpc-exam-to-be-abandoned-mid-way-through/\" title=\"\">fire alarm went off</a> two thirds of the way through the three-hour business law and practice exam at Liverpool John Moores University. The opportunity the students had to speak to each other outside the exam hall after they were evacuated meant that they weren't allowed to return to their papers, and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) consulted by the university for advice. Some of the students affected feared they might be required to resit, and a student who had been in the exam told me that she felt \"annoyed and in limbo.\" Happily, though, having considered the matter, the SRA have decided to upscale students' marks using what they describe as \"a complicated mathematical formula to ensure all are treated fairly\".</p> <p><em>Alex Aldridge is the editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.legalcheek.com/\" title=\"\"><em>LegalCheek.com</em></a></p>",

Apple had been running a counter on its website and store, so the 25bn mark was actually reached over the weekend. The company has now revealed which app was the 25 billionth, as well as the name of the downloader: Chunli Fu in Qingdao, China. Late chief executive Steve Jobs would surely have approved of both. He was Disney's largest shareholder in his later years, after it acquired his Pixar Animation Studios. Meanwhile, China has been an important growth market for Apple in the last year, as the iPhone went on sale there. \"We'd like to thank our customers and developers for helping us achieve this historic milestone of 25 billion apps downloaded,\" said Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services Eddy Cue. \"When we launched the App Store less than four years ago, we never imagined that mobile apps would become the phenomenon they have, or that developers would create such an incredible selection of apps for iOS users.\" That's true enough. Walter Isaacson's authorised biography of Jobs revealed that Apple executives had to lobby hard to convince him that apps would enhance the iPhone, rather than harm it. \"He didn't want outsiders to create applications for the iPhone that could mess it up, infect it with viruses, or pollute its integrity,\" wrote Isaacson, while quoting senior vice president of worldwide product marketing Phi Schiller on the lobbying efforts. \"I couldn't imagine that we would create something as powerful as the iPhone and not empower developers to make lots of apps. I knew customers would love them,\" said Schiller. Apple has sold more than 315m iOS devices since the launch of the first iPhone in 2007, meaning a rough average of 80 app downloads per device \u2013 although it should be noted that many people will have bought more than one and carried their apps across. From a development standpoint, the 550,000 iOS apps have generated an average of 45,000 downloads each, although the figures will be skewed by the most popular apps like Angry Birds, Facebook, eBay, Twitter and others, which have done tens or even hundreds of millions of iOS downloads. The 25bn milestone comes ahead of Apple's press event on 5 March to unveil its next-generation iPad tablet, which reports suggest may be called iPad HD rather than iPad 3. The App Store reached 10bn downloads in January 2011, then 15bn in July that year. It has taken eight months for the next 10bn downloads: a rate of 1.25bn a month, or 41.6m a day. As a comparison, Google recently announced that its Android Market store is generating 1bn monthly app downloads.",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Theresa May, has delayed the national roll-out of \"Clare's Law\", a scheme under which people would be able to ask the police if their partners have a history of domestic violence. May told MPs on Monday that a consultation over a national disclosure scheme had raised fears it could be used for \"fishing\" or \"spying\". Concerns were also raised about the release of police intelligence material based on unproven allegations that could be used to stigmatise innocent people. A 12 month pilot will instead run in four police force areas \u2013 Manchester, Gwent, Nottinghamshire and Wiltshire \u2013 to test both a \"right to ask\" and a \"right to know\" scheme. \"The consultation raised important issues on the scope and proportionality of the information that should be disclosed to potential victims and the safeguards that are needed against malicious applications,\" May said in a Commons written statement. \"I believe that it is right that these issues are addressed and tested in a pilot to ensure that the disclosure scheme is compatible with all relevant law.\" May said in October that she wanted to see a national disclosure scheme for potential victims of domestic violence but needed to decide whether it should be on a \"right to ask\" or a \"right to know\" basis. The first is triggered by a request from the public and the second by the police deciding to disclose the information to protect a potential victim, even if they had not asked. The scheme does not require new legal powers and would involve the disclosure of convictions for domestic violence as well as police intelligence on the background of a particular individual, which may include reports of incidents that have not been proven. \"This pilot scheme is designed to prevent tragic incidents from happening, such as that of Clare Wood, by ensuring that there is a clear framework in place with recognised and consistent processes for disclosing information,\" said May. Wood, a 36-year-old mother, was murdered by her former partner, George Appleton, in Manchester in 2009. She had met him on the internet. He had three previous convictions under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and was later found hanged. The police were criticised for individual and systemic failings in their handling of the case by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The proposed national disclosure scheme was strongly criticised as a waste of money by Refuge, the charity that helps victims of domestic violence, which says the government should start by improving the police response to calls for help. \"We are at an absolute loss as to why the government is introducing the new disclosure scheme,\" said its chief executive, Sandra Horley. \"It simply isn't supported by any of us with the expertise to judge its chances of success.\" The home secretary also announced on Monday that she was moving to close some loopholes in the sex offenders register after a high court case giving a right of appeal after 15 years to those who are placed on it for life. May said she would amend the legislation to ensure that all 44,000 on the register who travel abroad for less than three days would have to notify the police, as would those who live in households with a child under 18. The rules are also to be tightened so that those who change their names can no longer seek to avoid being on the register.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyd's of London insurer Amlin expects to return to profit this year after \u00a3500m of natural disaster losses pushed it deep into the red last year. Insurers around the world were hit by claims of $108bn (\u00a368bn) following an unprecedented run of catastrophes, including Japan's earthquake in March 2011, in what was the second-costliest natural disaster year on record. Amlin, the biggest insurer operating in the Lloyd's of London market, reported a loss before tax of \u00a3193.8m last year on Monday, compared with a profit of \u00a3259.2m in 2010. Its net catastrophe losses of \u00a3500.8m far exceeded the expected \u00a3170m. Shares in the company dropped 15.6p, or 4.4%, to 335.9p on the news. Amlin said its major catastrophe claims were mainly the result of earthquakes, and for the first time it suffered record disaster losses mainly from outside the US. With earthquakes it is difficult to estimate initial losses so it was forced to revise its estimates during the year. The company has bought more reinsurance this year to reduce risks. In addition, ACI, the lossmaking European commercial insurer it bought from Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis three years ago, suffered several large losses in the first half of the year. Chief executive Charles Philipps described 2011 as an \"exceptionally challenging year\" for Amlin. But with reinsurance prices rising, particularly for UK commercial motor insurance, he expects to return to a \"good level of profitability\" this year. Amlin was able to push through average rate increases of 4% at the start of the year when customers renewed their policies. Despite the 2011 loss Amlin will pay out a dividend of 23p, unchanged from the previous year, in a sign of confidence in its future. Philipps said there were no plans to sell ACI, which provides marine, commercial property and liability insurance. \"We truly still believe this business is capable of generating good returns,\" he said. \"We wouldn't get rid of it after all the hard work.\" The division is expected to \"move towards\" an underwriting profit this year after a restructuring. This appears to be a shift from previous guidance that the business would break even. Roger Taylor, who has been Amlin's chairman since its creation from the merger of Angerstein and Murray Lawrence in 1998, will step down as at the annual meeting on 17 May. He will be succeeded by Richard Davey, who has sat on the board since 2005. He spent the majority of his career at N M Rothschild, where he was head of investment banking and chairman of the executive committee. A financial services sector specialist, he advised Lloyd's of London during its crisis during the early 1990s when spiralling asbestosis claims almost brought the insurance market to its knees.",

In addition, ACI, the lossmaking European commercial insurer it bought from Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis three years ago, suffered several large losses in the first half of the year.</p> <p>Chief executive Charles Philipps described 2011 as an \"exceptionally challenging year\" for Amlin. But with reinsurance prices rising, particularly for UK commercial motor insurance, he expects to return to a \"good level of profitability\" this year. Amlin was able to push through average rate increases of 4% at the start of the year when customers renewed their policies.</p> <p>Despite the 2011 loss Amlin will pay out a dividend of 23p, unchanged from the previous year, in a sign of confidence in its future.</p> <p>Philipps said there were no plans to sell ACI, which provides marine, commercial property and liability insurance. \"We truly still believe this business is capable of generating good returns,\" he said. \"We wouldn't get rid of it after all the hard work.\"</p> <p>The division is expected to \"move towards\" an underwriting profit this year after a restructuring. This appears to be a shift from previous guidance that the business would break even.</p> <p>Roger Taylor, who has been Amlin's chairman since its creation from the merger of Angerstein and Murray Lawrence in 1998, will step down as at the annual meeting on 17 May. He will be succeeded by Richard Davey, who has sat on the board since 2005. He spent the majority of his career at N M Rothschild, where he was head of investment banking and chairman of the executive committee. A financial services sector specialist, he advised Lloyd's of London during its crisis during the early 1990s when spiralling asbestosis claims almost brought the insurance market to its knees.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ministers want to ease regulation of gangmasters, just a few years after a crackdown on rogue employers who force vulnerable people to work in poor conditions for low pay. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) was set up with support across the political spectrum after 23 cockle pickers drowned in the rising tide in Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, in 2004 in an incident that provoked outrage at the problem of unregulated labour gangs. But reacting to complaints from farmers about the \"burden of administration and inspection\" by the GLA, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has agreed to look at ways of reducing the impact of the authority on employers. It said it would instruct the GLA to \"minimise disruption\" when conducting spot checks or planned visits to interview workers, and was considering extending a trial of \"lighter-touch\" regulation. Further reviews of the authority's work would continue as part of the national \"red tape challenge\", Defra said. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is also looking at alternatives to the GLA's licensing regime \u2013 another recommendation from the farmers' report. Defra said it would make legal changes if necessary. It also suggested the new approach could be extended beyond farming to other sectors covered by the GLA: fish, shellfish, meat, dairy and food processing. Last year, the authority identified 845 abused workers and successfully prosecuted 12 cases against gangmasters, who can face up to 10 years in jail for operating without a licence. Among cases the GLA uncovered were 12 workers living in a caravan with no water, sanitation, lighting or cooking facilities and 30 workers living in a structurally dangerous two-bedroom house whom men wielding baseball bats had threatened with immediate eviction if they complained. Defra's move, after recommendations by a special taskforce on reducing regulation for farmers, follows a high-profile case in which 19 dairy farmers, including the vice-president of the NFU, Gwyn Jones, were charged with employing labour from an unlicensed gangmaster. Eighteen of the 19 defendants, including Jones, have pleaded not guilty; the other has not issued a plea in the case, which is due to come before a court this month. A spokesman for Defra said the government was still \"committed to protecting vulnerable workers\" but also wanted to reduce burdens on law-abiding businesses. However, the wide-ranging attack on the GLA's work has alarmed staff at the authority and campaigners who fought for it to be set up. A spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services union said its members at the GLA were \"furious\" about the proposals from Defra. The authority's funding is also being cut by about 20% by the end of the parliament, in 2015. \"We have grave concerns about the government's plans for this agency that was set up because vulnerable workers lost their lives but is now distastefully branded as 'red tape' holding back business,\" said the PCS spokesman. \"Its role should be expanded, not reduced.\" Supporters of the GLA pointed out that cracking down on rogue gangmasters was good for employers and good for consumers, who did not have to worry about buying products produced by \"slave labour\". Labour MP Jack Dromey said the authority, which has stopped gangmasters who avoided tax and VAT, was now identifying victims of human trafficking employed on farms and construction sites. As deputy leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union (now Unite), Dromey helped build a huge coalition of cross-party and industry support for the authority, including backing from the National Farmers Union and supermarkets. \"Ultimately, this is about what kind of society we want to live in,\" Dromey said. \"Do we really want our food from farms or our house-building to be undertaken by modern-day slave labour? I personally find it absolutely extraordinary that we're having this debate.\" The Labour MP John McDonnell, who has warned that supermarkets' low prices are driving suppliers to cut pay and conditions for workers, said regulation of gangmasters was more important than ever in a recession, when people were more desperate for work. \"People are extremely shocked at the government's move to weaken the GLA powers,\" said McDonnell. \"When unemployment is rising, people will become more vulnerable to gangmasters, rather than less. This has broken the cross-party consensus that introduced the legislation in the first place after the cockle pickers [died].\" Ian Livsey, the GLA chief executive, said of the proposed changes: \"It doesn't have to be bad, but I want to see how it unfolds.\" A Defra spokesperson said: \"Our response to the farming regulation taskforce very much focuses on simplifying the processes which unnecessarily impose burdens. The commitment to high standards in animal welfare, environmental protection and workers' rights remains the same. \"This government is committed to protecting vulnerable workers and we're looking at improving the operation of the GLA so that it can target high-risk activities better while reducing burdens on compliant businesses.\" The farming regulation taskforce was set up in 2010 and its report was published the following year. As well as changes to the GLA, it suggested another 200 ways in which their job could be made easier, ranging from more forms being made available to fill in online to lighter regulation for farmers who were part of independent food quality schemes. The government's formal response said it accepted 159 recommendations, including the ones relating to the GLA, and was actively considering another 31; 18 suggestions were for the Food Standards Agency, it said.",

      "bodyText": "No one can dispute that the great majority of Christian schools in England have a predominantly middle-class intake. The question is whether this represents a policy of social exclusion on the part of the Roman Catholic and Anglican authorities, or whether it reflects the composition of mainstream Christianity in this country and the competitive behaviour of the middle classes. If schools select by religious allegiance and their co-religionists are concentrated in particular social classes, then you will get a skewed social distribution no matter what the religious authorities intend. This seems to be the case with the Roman Catholics. A 2009 paper by two academics, Rebecca Allen and Anne West, concluded that the low number of free school meal parents in Catholic schools was a result of the steady rise up the social scale of Catholic parents since the 1950s. Similar considerations apply to the small number of state Muslim schools (overwhelmingly more free school meals than the postcode average) and to Jewish schools at the other end of the socio-economic scale. According to two rabbis I have recently spoken to, 50% of Jewish children are now educated in faith schools. The Church of England, which runs the majority of faith schools in this country, lies between the Roman Catholics and the secular schools in this analysis. But does that reflect religious discrimination? The church claims not: on its figures, the great majority of its 4,000 primary schools apply no religious test at all, though some in London reserve some of their places for churchgoers. Sixty-seven of the 160 voluntary aided secondary schools reserved more than half of their places for churchgoers. The Allen and West paper found that in 2009 only about two thirds of the children in Catholic and Church of England schools had even one parent of the appropriate faith. On the other hand, any London parent has stories of people who attend church regularly and entirely hypocritically to obtain a place for their child in a favoured school. Others, of course, will just move house to a favoured catchment area, which is felt to be less hypocritical; also, their reward is not in heaven but in the housing market, which many modern parents prefer. The British Humanist Association points out that faith schools can legally discriminate when employing teaching staff, and that 43 local authorities allow voluntary controlled (as well as voluntary aided) schools to use religious tests for admission. However an analysis of the schools in those 43 authorities show no significant change from voluntary controlled schools elsewhere, where there is no religious criterion for admission. The most we can reliably conclude is that a faith character is often taken to be a signal of a good or successful school. Once that happens, the process will be self-sustaining in the Darwinian world of modern education, where schools must compete for success or die. The irony then becomes that complaints that faith schools are successful or biased towards the middle classes will only make them more attractive to competitive parents. If the British Humanist Association really wants faith schools to disappear, it should put out press releases featuring Church of England primary schools blighted by drug wars and pregnancy among the pupils. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "With the Leveson inquiry into media ethics and practices attracting so much attention, it was easy to overlook another contribution to the debate about media law last week: the government's response to the draft defamation bill. The document needs to be seen against the background of reform dating back to March 2010, when the culture, media and sport select committee identified some problems with existing defamation law in the context of a wider look at press standards. At the general election, all three major political parties expressed support for reforming libel laws. In May 2010, Lord Lester of Herne Hill introduced his draft private member's bill, followed by the government's draft bill in March last year. Then came the joint committee's own series of recommendations, based around \"four core principles\": freedom of expression/protection of reputation, reducing costs, accessibility and cultural change. The committee went considerably further towards the \"libel reform\" agenda than the original draft bill and took on board a number of the reform lobby's concerns. It's easy to think defamation reform is last year's model. The response has a sense of calm about it; it feels strangely comforting, not least because it seems remote from the intensely personal saga currently playing before the Leveson inquiry. Reformists may feel it doesn't go far enough, but it's a considered document which reaffirms the coalition's commitment to protecting free speech - but also pays homage to what is coming out of Leveson by reminding of the need to \"strike a fair balance\" so that people who are defamed are able to take appropriate action and so that \"correct balance between freedom of expression and privacy\" is ensured. Recommendations that have been accepted and which I welcome include replacing the draft bill's test of \"substantial harm\" to reputation with a \"stricter test\" of \"serious harm\". The government believes this stiffer hurdle, combined with procedures allowing key preliminary issues (such as meaning) resolved early in any litigation, will remove many of the concerns about corporations suing. These suggestions are unlikely to be enough to satisfy the reform lobby, who would like to see a more blanket prohibition on the ability of \"non-natural persons\" to sue for libel. Practically, the government have probably struck the right balance here \u2013 robust judicial intervention on issues such as meaning, comment and seriousness, a tougher test of serious harm and increased use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), are likely to have a significant practical impact on the ability of corporations to use their financial muscle to intimidate smaller publications through the libel proceedings. On the proposed statutory responsible journalism defence , the government has rejected suggestions from the committee that new factors referring to \"resources\" and \"editorial judgment\" should be added to the list of factors used to determine whether a publisher has acted responsibly in publishing on a matter of public interest. It has agreed with the suggestion that \"urgency\" be replaced with \"timing of the publication\". Interestingly, in the light of discussions in the forum of the Leveson inquiry, the government sticks to its initial view that public interest should not be defined. The government has said it will go back to the drawing board on how to word a defence of reportage, accepting that current wording is too wide. Regarding \"honest opinion\", the government has said it will look further at including a provision which would make it clear that \"bare opinions\" which do not contain the gist of the facts on which the opinion is based should not be protected, as well as how to clarify what is meant by privilege in this context. The government has accepted there should be an extended power for judges to order a defendant to publish (with proportionate prominence) a summary of the court's judgment at the end of a defamation trial \u2013 and although already a requirement for the print media, the response accepts it would be inappropriate to give the court power to order the publication of an apology. This is to be welcomed: nothing can be served by forcing a newspaper to publish an apology it doesn't believe in. The response acknowledges the need to provide clear protection for peer-reviewed academic and scientific articles: there is still some work to be done on this area to get in place a sufficient level of protection to satisfy those who operate in this area, who are not mainstream media organisations and need to have proper clarity on the scope of the proposed new privilege around scientific and academic conferences. On libel tourism, while the government says it does not think listing factors to be considered when allowing foreign claimants to bring libel actions in the UK are suitable matters for inclusion in the bill, it is encouraging that it intends to ask the Civil Procedure Rule Committee to produce such a list. I can't count how many times in recent years there have been statements by government (and the judiciary) about the need for the defamation pre-action protocol to be strengthened, so parties are encouraged to use ADR with costs sanctions for unreasonable refusals to do so. So while I am pleased to see this included, I won't believe it until I see it. A number of practitioners on both sides of the fence spent a lot of time last year re-drafting it though the Civil Justice Council, only to see the results disappear into the long grass . The proposals for promoting the early resolution of key issues also need to be urgently pursued: they feed in well to the suggestions being advanced by the Media Standards Trust, the Hacked Off campaign and the Alternative Libel Project, all of which endorse the need for cost effective alternatives to using the courts to resolve libel and privacy disputes. A considerable amount of the response is taken up with internet publications. The government rightly acknowledges that this whole area is still horribly problematic and that there needs to be a greater degree of protection against liability for intermediaries, but sees the committee's proposal for a two-track system to be unworkable in practice. It gives tentative support for a system based around notification or take down, and has said it will discuss this option further. It's worth remembering how far libel reform have come. While there are some encouraging points in this response, there's still some way to go yet.",

      "bodyText": "Roberto Di Matteo may be unloved by some of Chelsea's squad and is no man-manager or master tactician in the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho mould but, as a short-term appointment, he holds three aces. First and foremost the former Italy midfielder is adored by Chelsea fans who recall his role in securing the five trophies won by the club during his Stamford Bridge playing days. Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, John Terry et al will be smart enough to appreciate a potentially powerful synergy between stands and technical area. As he tackles Tuesday night's vital FA Cup replay at Birmingham, next week's daunting Champions league second leg at home to Napoli and the race for fourth place in the Premier League likely to stretch until the end of the season, Di Matteo can expect to surf a wave of goodwill. It can only be reinforced by Chelsea supporters' sadness at the way his six years of smooth passes and spectacular long-range goals ended in 2002. The cruel triple fracture \u2013 plus substantial nerve and soft tissue damage \u2013 of Di Matteo's left leg plunged him into a five-year post-retirement depression. Fans do not need to be overly sentimental to hope that the second coming of a 41-year-old who still suffers severe discomfort from the network of scars on his leg enjoys a much happier conclusion to this latest Stamford Bridge incarnation. Di Matteo's second ace card is that he boasts a less than shabby, albeit relatively brief, managerial track record. Having begun taking his coaching badges while still a Chelsea player he is a highly qualified, deeply analytical coach who led MK Dons to the League One play-offs before winning West Bromwich Albion automatic promotion to the Premier League. When, in February 2011, Di Matteo was sacked and replaced at The Hawthorns by Roy Hodgson, eyebrows were raised. Granted, Hodgson's installation would soon appear a masterstroke but, prior to a disappointing run of two wins in 10 games, Di Matteo's easy-on-the-eye West Brom were winning all sorts of plaudits. Eighth in December 2010, they had, memorably, beaten Arsenal at the Emirates, hammered Everton 4-1 away and drawn at Manchester United. Until West Brom's New Year slump no one was mentioning that some of the players at The Hawthorns felt their sometimes stand-offish Swiss-born manager was a little too aloof and overly keen on delegation. Now, though, the slight superiority complex critics perceived in Di Matteo may aid his survival amid one of the Premier League's most difficult, player-power-suffused and highly politicised dressing rooms. This represents ace number three. If a firm friendship with Dennis Wise, his old Chelsea team-mate, has helped make Di Matteo seriously streetwise \u2013 not to mention thoroughly versed in the little nuances of Premier League dressing-room culture \u2013 he, unlike Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, can show Cole and company a few medals of his own. After all, no one is capped 34 times by Italy without being able to play a bit. The respect this on-pitch track record brings him may be grudging but it would be a major surprise were it not to buy Di Matteo a bit of time. It may also help that he is evidently brighter than average. Depressed he may have been but during those difficult five years after his leg injury Di Matteo variously studied for an MBA (master of business administration) at the European Business School, ran an Italian restaurant in west London and did some media work. In a cameo role which will inevitably be as much about psychology as coaching, his insights into human nature accrued during such experiences carry the potential to serve him well. As Chelsea attempt to overcome Birmingham, overturn that 3-1 deficit to Napoli and pip Arsenal, Newcastle and, just possibly, Liverpool to fourth place, it cannot hinder their caretaker coach's cause that many of the club's ageing stars might suddenly realise they need to start fighting for new contracts or suitably lucrative employment elsewhere. While the players may be jubilant at seeing the back of Villas-Boas, there could also be the odd private residue of guilt for Di Matteo to mine. \"I'd like to think that, in future years, some senior professionals at Chelsea will apologise to Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas,\" said Alan Pardew, the Newcastle United manager. \"They've made it very hard for him. I had a similar thing in my first season at West Ham with senior professionals. A few have since apologised to me for what they did. And so they should. It wasn't right. Because of what's gone on at Chelsea English football has lost a brilliant young coach.\" Di Matteo's challenge now is to ensure that by the time he celebrates his 42nd birthday in May, he will be enjoying the successful relaunch of a managerial career expected to be continued away from Stamford Bridge.",

      "bodyText": "Every year, Lionhead runs something it calls a creative day. All the development staff get the chance to leave their ongoing projects, gather into small groups and brainstorm new ideas. They might put forward clever software tools or a fresh way of working; sometimes they make games. Fable Heroes started out like this. But unlike many of these other experimental diversions, it is about to leave the building, via a full release on Xbox Live Arcade. And here's why. Imagine Fable re-built as a Gauntlet-style co-op dungeon crawler, with cartoon visuals, bags of humour and a neat sideline in moral consequence. That's Fable Heroes. Up to four players \u2013 either local or online \u2013 choose from a selection of 12 doll-like characters, all based on familiar faces from the RPG trilogy. The cute combatants then fight their way through eight environments, battling weird hybrid versions of the Fable monsters, then grabbing the gold coins that spill from felled creatures. It is absolutely as fun as it sounds, especially in split-screen local multiplayer, which captures those riotous Gauntlet sessions of old. The combat is slick and satisfying, with a quick light attack, a more elaborate \"flourish\" move on the Y button, and a dodge move, all of which can be used in speedy combinations. The warriors must work together to progress, but as in all decent co-op dungeon slashers, competing for gold is important. At the end of each level, your cash stash dictates how much you can level up your character. Greed is good. Greed works. The fun of the game, however comes in the balance between your cooperative and competitive instincts. It's possible to hit the right trigger for a super powerful move, but this takes one of your heart icons, which puts you a step closer to death \u2013 yet it may well prove a vital sacrifice for your team. If a character runs out of hearts, they become a ghost, still able to damage enemies, but unable to pick up gold. Dead enemies occasionally drop heart icons, though, and if the ghost player grabs one, they come back to life. At the same time, getting to hearts before any phantom co-warriors may be advantageous, ensuring that there's one less person to compete with for loot. It's a compelling interplay of altruistic and selfish tactics, cleverly reflecting the moral component of the main Fable titles. Lead designer Ted Timmins says he and colleague Jon Eckersley dreamed up the idea for Heroes one afternoon in the staff cafe. They thought it might make a jolly little project for a forthcoming creative day, so they gathered four more staff and started bashing together a prototype, using the Fable engine, but massively modifying it for their vision. \"We worked nights and weekends, and after a couple of weeks we had a demo,\" explains Timmins. \"Creative day was then delayed for six months but we thought, we've got something cool here, maybe we should show it off. So we grabbed the design manager of Fable, Josh Atkins, and he said, 'wow, let me get Louise [Copley, the head of Fable Studio]'. We did the whole demo again and she said, 'I'd better get Peter'. So Peter comes in sits down, watches it and says, 'this is amazing!' We were gobsmacked.\" Quickly the project was greenlit. Ted and his team were given more staff and were even set up in their own office across the road from Lionhead. In the space of a few weeks, Timmins and Eckersley had gone from crunch time on a Fable III DLC pack to running their own development team. \"I started here as a work experience kid in 2004,\" says Timmins. \"To think I'm now project lead on a Fable title ... it's just crazy. It's awesome!\" Last week, I played the first level, Millfields. It's a quaint romp through lush green fields and villages, all inhabited by the familiar Hobbe creatures from the Fable universe, but here strangely fitted with chicken heads. Other stages include the icy Mists Peak, the dungeon-like Hobbe Caves and a gloomy cemetery \u2013 all drawn with a crisp cartoon style. \"It's kind of inspired by Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker,\" says Timmins. \"When you go for realism, there's a limitation on how long it will look good for, but Wind Waker was so stylised. My girlfriend is playing through it now and it looks as good as ever. And Albion looks great like this.\" The cloth-like lead characters fit in perfectly with this kawaii look. \"I originally designed a group of four fairly generic heroes, but it didn't feel right,\" says Timmons. \"So Jon said perhaps we could play as children, with oversized heads. But again, it wasn't right. Then the penny dropped \u2013 Fable has always featured hero dolls, let's use them! Jon and his art team created a bunch and it fit perfectly.\" Naturally, all the characters have their own weapons and styles of combat. Hero from Fable 3 gets a sword, which is fast, but does less damage than Hammer's, erm, hammer. Garth floats eerily along, using magic attacks, while Reaver has his ranger gun, which offers a handy distance attack. This is an advantage when it comes to avoiding damage from melee weapons, but it means he's that bit further away from the gold when he kills something, giving unscrupulous pals the chance to mop it all up. Between battles, players come across treasure chests, which provide juicy power-ups to whoever gets there first. There are around 15 possibilities: one turns the character into a giant more powerful version of themselves, another provides a doppelg\u00e4nger to fight alongside you. Brilliantly, some chests provide either a good or an evil option; go for the latter and you'll get to select another member of your squad and curse them. The result will be some unfortunate impediment, like a black cloud that hangs over the character, sucking up all their gold. However, whoever has the cloud can get rid of it by touching another player, so the whole thing becomes a chaotic game of cloud tag. At the end of each stage, players get to choose between a boss battle and a mini-game \u2013 they're both fantastic fun. In the former category, there's a giant clockwork beetle, a Hobbe king who shoots Hobbes at you out of a shotgun, and a sentinel from Fable 3. Players also get the option to play through all eight levels in a harder nighttime mode, complete with trickier versions of the end-of-level encounters. This mode will include one last surprise character \u2013 a series favourite, apparently \u2013 who'll provide the ultimate Fable boss battle. \"It's going to make every fan boy's head explode,\" says Timmins. I ask if it's Peter Molyneux. \"We did talk about that,\" he laughs. \"But we thought, well, he's given us the keys to the franchise, maybe we shouldn't. However, he does feature in the last level, I'll tell you that much.\" Mini-games meanwhile, feature the likes of Kicking Chickens, where you have to avoid explosive poultry by booting them at other players. There's also Chicken Football, and a mine cart level where you hammer a button to hurtle along the rails. These frantic, ultra competitive bouts provide an entertaining distraction \u2013 and once completed, they're available to play separately from the main menu. Just right for those quick multiplayer face-offs. At the end of each stage, players are taken to a board game table, where gold coins are transferred into dice rolls. Here, each space you land on provides a different power-up, ranging from new finishing moves to more damaging weapons, greater speed and even funnier facial expressions. Apparently, this system somehow combines with in-game achievements to create infinite power-up possibilities \u2013 though Timmins won't say how. More will become clear at E3 no doubt. There is also set to be some interplay with the Kinect spinoff Fable: The Journey, which will be released after Heroes. Apparently, any coins you earn in Heroes can be imported into Journey so you're able to level up your character before you even start. Alternatively, if you have a Journey game save on your HD, you can open up exclusive items and characters in Heroes. Plus, every doll you unlock in Heroes shows up in your inventory in Journey, so you can then hang it on your in-game cart. Heroes is a fantastic little surprise that looks set to pitch the hectic fun of Castle Crashers and its ilk into the rich Fable universe. Timmins hinted to me that if it's a success, we may well see similar spin-offs in the future. This year it's frenetic Gauntlet-style dungeon romping; next year a Fable FPS, perhaps? Or how about ... Fable tennis?",

      "body": "<p>Every year, Lionhead runs something it calls a creative day. All the development staff get the chance to leave their ongoing projects, gather into small groups and brainstorm new ideas. They might put forward clever software tools or a fresh way of working; sometimes they make games. Fable Heroes started out like this. But unlike many of these other experimental diversions, it is about to leave the building, via a full release on Xbox Live Arcade. And here's why.</p> <p>Imagine Fable re-built as a Gauntlet-style co-op dungeon crawler, with cartoon visuals, bags of humour and a neat sideline in moral consequence. That's Fable Heroes. Up to four players \u2013 either local or online \u2013 choose from a selection of 12 doll-like characters, all based on familiar faces from the RPG trilogy. The cute combatants then fight their way through eight environments, battling weird hybrid versions of the Fable monsters, then grabbing the gold coins that spill from felled creatures.</p> <p>It is absolutely as fun as it sounds, especially in split-screen local multiplayer, which captures those riotous Gauntlet sessions of old. The combat is slick and satisfying, with a quick light attack, a more elaborate \"flourish\" move on the Y button, and a dodge move, all of which can be used in speedy combinations. The warriors must work together to progress, but as in all decent co-op dungeon slashers, competing for gold is important. At the end of each level, your cash stash dictates how much you can level up your character. Greed is good. Greed works.</p> <p>The fun of the game, however comes in the balance between your cooperative and competitive instincts. It's possible to hit the right trigger for a super powerful move, but this takes one of your heart icons, which puts you a step closer to death \u2013 yet it may well prove a vital sacrifice for your team. If a character runs out of hearts, they become a ghost, still able to damage enemies, but unable to pick up gold.</p> <p>Dead enemies occasionally drop heart icons, though, and if the ghost player grabs one, they come back to life. At the same time, getting to hearts <em>before</em> any phantom co-warriors may be advantageous, ensuring that there's one less person to compete with for loot. It's a compelling interplay of altruistic and selfish tactics, cleverly reflecting the moral component of the main Fable titles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386912767\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330956054143/Fable-Heroes-007.jpg\" alt=\"Fable Heroes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fable Heroes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lead designer Ted Timmins says he and colleague Jon Eckersley dreamed up the idea for Heroes one afternoon in the staff cafe. They thought it might make a jolly little project for a forthcoming creative day, so they gathered four more staff and started bashing together a prototype, using the Fable engine, but massively modifying it for their vision.</p> <p>\"We worked nights and weekends, and after a couple of weeks we had a demo,\" explains Timmins. \"Creative day was then delayed for six months but we thought, we've got something cool here, maybe we should show it off. So we grabbed the design manager of Fable, Josh Atkins, and he said, 'wow, let me get Louise [Copley, the head of Fable Studio]'. We did the whole demo again and she said, 'I'd better get Peter'. So Peter comes in sits down, watches it and says, 'this is amazing!' We were gobsmacked.\"</p> <p>Quickly the project was greenlit. Ted and his team were given more staff and were even set up in their own office across the road from Lionhead. In the space of a few weeks, Timmins and Eckersley had gone from crunch time on a Fable III DLC pack to running their own development team. \"I started here as a work experience kid in 2004,\" says Timmins. \"To think I'm now project lead on a Fable title ... it's just crazy. It's awesome!\"</p> <p>Last week, I played the first level, Millfields. It's a quaint romp through lush green fields and villages, all inhabited by the familiar Hobbe creatures from the Fable universe, but here strangely fitted with chicken heads. Other stages include the icy Mists Peak, the dungeon-like Hobbe Caves and a gloomy cemetery \u2013 all drawn with a crisp cartoon style. \"It's kind of inspired by Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker,\" says Timmins. \"When you go for realism, there's a limitation on how long it will look good for, but Wind Waker was so stylised.

      "bodyText": "If you haven't read Sir Ian Blair's Guardian article endorsing plans to privatise many of the functions of the police, you ought to. It reflects two iron rules of the relentless drive to outsource and marketise the parts of the state that have so far been left alone: first, that mindboggling policy extremes tend to be recast as matters of simple common sense; and second, that nothing suits those who would dissolve the barrier between state and market like a crisis, which is the essence of what Naomi Klein famously called the Shock Doctrine. I am not accusing Blair \u2013 nor, indeed, the equally supportive Association of Chief Police Officers \u2013 of being zealous privateers; the point is, they are inserted into a tangle of institutions so relentlessly pushed towards what people like me call neoliberalism that they almost unthinkingly do its work. His argument is measured; level-headed, even. As he sees it, now that the \"shibboleth\" of police numbers has been dropped, and forces are thereby free to manage the impact of such drastic cuts, outsourcing has become a very sensible option. This is not, he says, \"a shock, horror idea\". The basic pitch is all about efficiency and \"modernisation\": to use the argot of the last government, \"what works\". But here's what Blair omits: this debate is also about accountability, transparency and the most fundamental elements of democracy \u2013 not to mention the question of who the police are there to serve, and what they are meant to do. This much is obvious. The growth of a huge shadow state, manned by private firms and built on monopoly contracts, has proceeded by increments. First came the utilities; then carefully chosen parts of health, then education, along with a ragbag of stuff usually grouped under \"back office\" and \"support services\". Then, slightly longer ago than you might think, the divide between the most elemental parts of the state and the private sector began to corrode. New Labour was an enthusiastic promoter of privatised prisons and outsourced detention. Seven years ago, I was sent an article from a local newspaper in my native Cheshire announcing the privatisation of police custody, involving a 30-year contract \u2013 oh, the disciplines of the market! \u2013 being given to a firm called Cheshire Custody Services, and cells becoming \"custody suites\". It boggled my mind: I had just written a book that partly examined New Labour's record on privatisation, and thought it might boggle those of other people, too. But when I raised the story in at an event hosted by Demos, that most cutting-edge of London thinktanks, few people seemed shocked. Though the plans were actually about as non-efficient as could be imagined, uppermost in their minds, I suppose, were deeply ingrained ideas: \"modernisation\", \"what works\". As any politics undergraduate knows, this is how hegemony works. Almost silently, yesterday's insane scheme becomes today's matter of dull inevitability. In Westminster, policy wonks and thrusting politicians are so close to the cutting edge that when they alight on a supposedly visionary idea, much of their work is devoted to how to roll it out so that precious few people even notice. There is something of the frog-in-boiling-water about this: the privatising of everything (and I chose that last word carefully) proceeds so insidiously that by the time people fully grasp what's happening, it's far, far too late. In that context, I have recently been thinking about a morning I spent at the Adam Smith Institute, the undoubtedly forward-looking, free-market thinktank that has a habit of advocating things many years before they actually come to pass. In late 2005, I had a two-hour conversation with Dr Eamonn Butler, the ASI's director and co-founder. Parts of it are worth quoting at reasonable length, not least the parts about the police: EB: \"Basically, you try these things, and where it doesn't work, you stop. And you don't know where that's going to be. For many years, people have said to us, 'Well, where does it all end? Would you privatise the army, or the police?' And I say this. Mrs Thatcher did the easy ones first \u2026 And if you look at things like the police, Post Office, health, education, welfare services, all of those things \u2013 in theory, all of that could be outsourced. But how should it actually be delivered? All you can do is try, and see what happens. It may work, and it may not work at all.\" JH: So you can outsource the police? Do you have any ideas about the practical application of all that? EB: \"Well, you're putting words in my mouth. What I'm saying is, something like the police is an interesting example. If you come along and say, 'Right \u2013 I think we should privatise the police', you won't get very far. If you said, 'Instead of the money for the police being decided in Whitehall, chief police officers should decide how their budget is spent', that's a more sensible policy. And it may be that some of them decide that there's a number of things they do \u2013 not necessarily frontline policing, but just maybe the management of their cars or something \u2026 why does that have to be done by someone in a blue uniform?\" We now know this was prophetic stuff, but as it turns out, things may be about to go further than even Butler imagined. He was certainly on the money as regards \"managing the vehicle fleet\", but to quote from the news story by Alan Travis and Zoe Williams that revealed where things are headed, the list of envisaged outsourced functions is altogether more fundamental than that. From the top, then: \"investigating crimes, detaining suspects, developing cases, responding to and investigating incidents, supporting victims and witnesses, managing high-risk individuals, patrolling neighbourhoods, managing intelligence, managing engagement with the public \u2026\" So, some questions. In the wake of the Emma Harrison controversy, are we ready for people getting rich on the back of policing (or, to put it another way, the topsy-turvy proceeds of crime)? What parts of the contracts, and the internal machinations of the firms concerned, would be covered by our old friend \"commercial confidentiality\"? Given that any number of firms \u2013 G4S has reportedly been invited to bid for contracts, and good old Serco will doubtless be interested \u2013 will presumably be given their contracts on the basis of specified outputs, what will they be, and who decides? Whither the idea of policing as something holistic, and often qualitative rather than quantitative? Are we ready for deaths in private custody, or major slip-ups in outsourced investigations? As and when they occur, where will meaningful accountability reside, and at what point might contracts be subject to suspension? If that happened, would the police be in a position to take some services back inhouse, or would their privatisation so strip them of the know-how that, very quickly, doing so would no longer be an option? If you doubt the gravity of what's being proposed and the underhand way that it's happening, have a look at this blog by The Spectator's Fraser Nelson, which draws a comparison with the coalition's plans for the NHS, and points out that no legislation will be needed to push through what the headline calls Theresa May's \"quiet revolution\". And while you're reading, and thinking, maybe consider this: how would you feel about being kettled by a multinational corporation? Just a thought.",

Given that any number of firms \u2013 G4S has reportedly been invited to bid for contracts, and good old Serco will doubtless be interested \u2013 will presumably be given their contracts on the basis of specified outputs, what will they be, and who decides? Whither the idea of policing as something holistic, and often qualitative rather than quantitative?</p> <p>Are we ready for deaths in private custody, or major slip-ups in outsourced investigations? As and when they occur, where will meaningful accountability reside, and at what point might contracts be subject to suspension? If that happened, would the police be in a position to take some services back inhouse, or would their privatisation so strip them of the know-how that, very quickly, doing so would no longer be an option?</p> <p>If you doubt the gravity of what's being proposed and the underhand way that it's happening, have a look at <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/7690953/mays-quiet-revolution.thtml\" title=\"\">this blog</a> by The Spectator's Fraser Nelson, which draws a comparison with the coalition's plans for the NHS, and points out that no legislation will be needed to push through what the headline calls Theresa May's \"quiet revolution\". And while you're reading, and thinking, maybe consider this: how would you feel about being kettled by a multinational corporation? Just a thought.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Microsoft has revealed intriguing details of Halo 4's multiplayer mode. For the first time in the series, players will be able to customise the abilities and equipment of multiplayer characters through a progression system. Furthermore, developer 343 Industries \u2013 which has taken over the Halo franchise after the departure of its creator, Bungie Studios \u2013 has hinted that there may be some kind of social gaming service akin to Battlelog or Call of Duty: Elite. There could also be some kind of narrative element to multiplayer. Fans of the series may also be interested to note that the classic Battle rifle is back. The familiar pulse weapon looks set to be restored to its powerful specifications from the first Halo titles. Speaking at the Xbox Showcase event in San Francisco last week, creative director Josh Holmes told reporters: \"You, as a player, have the ability to customise all aspects of your Spartan warrior \u2013 and not just cosmetically. For the first time in a Halo title, you can actually change gameplay-impacting components. This allows you to customise load outs and gives you gameplay enhancements that can be unlocked through the progression system.\" In an interview with the Guardian later on, executive producer Kiki Wolfkill explained that 343 Industries had been looking at trends in the first-person genre, and had recognised the need to provide a more adapable and personalised multiplayer experience. \"We've looked at everything,\" she said. \"Whether it's first-person multiplayer or third-person \u2013 some very interesting things have happened there. And if we've seen some interesting design elements, even if they weren't successful in another game, they may have sparked interest for us. \"When we look at our multiplayer, one of the things we've explored is, because Halo is about the sandbox, about people playing how they want to, how do we push that even further? How do we really support different play styles in Halo 4? There's always been a lot of choice in Halo, but it's about pushing that even further. It gets back to how do we allow players to choose the thing that supports the play style that makes them the most successful.\" The move toward a full character progression system will no doubt be controversial with Halo fans, and will be viewed as a shift in style toward first-person shooter rivals such as Call of Duty and Battlefield. \"The community should have some confidence that it's been thought through as a Halo game,\" said franchise development director Frank O'Connor. \"The balance system has been considered as an intrinsic part the Halo feel. I'd like to tell people to be happy and confident and look forward to it, but I can't control that. We'll explain our decisions at a later date. It's been carefully considered.\" During a press briefing, Holmes also hinted that the infrastructure of the multiplayer mode is likely to evolve too, with changes to the lobby and matchmaking systems that suggest a more socially connected title. \"We're really changing the experience surrounding multiplayer,\" he said. \"We're providing a brand new experience for you and your friends to play, in a way you've never played Halo before.\" O'Connor was more specific in an interview later with the Guardian. \"If you've ever played Geometry Wars on the Xbox, it shows you the top 10 players in the whole world \u2013 who are also your friends,\" he said. \"This makes you feel more important and more succesful as a player than you actually are. \"It's all about contextualising. The number one rule of multiplayer game design is \u2013 everything is fun against a friend. Pong is fun against a friend! But it probably isn't against an anonymous random person. So socialising your multiplayer experience is the number one thing you have to do. It's something we'll be expanding on with Halo 4.\" Microsoft showed a couple of brief teaser videos revealing in-game visuals, and specifically two new Team Slayer maps: Warhouse and Wraparound. \"Warhouse is a civilian manufacturing plant that is in near space orbit around a gas giant,\" explained Holmes. \"It's been commisioned for the creation of a new weapons platform, the Cyclops Mark 2.\" The massive Cyclops mech can be seen in a huge arena in the middle of the map, around which multilayered metal platforms provide an extremely vertical experience. Wraparound is a similarly small, arena-based map focused on the Team Slayer mode. \"But this is a very different location,\" said Holmes. \"This is solar facility that is generating the artificial sunlight, creating the light and energy that powers a planet. \"Again, the focus is on great circular flow around the outer areas. You've got multiple levels, there are drop down areas on the catwalks so you can quickly transition from level to level \u2013 and then there are circular hallways that go round the outer edge and then connect back, either on the sides or through these man cannons that launch players through the air into the central space. \"Both of these maps are designed for fast play and constant action \u2013 really intense combat.\" While the gameplay looked similar to Halo experiences of the past, the environments show an interesting visual diversity, ranging from grungey industrial tech to glowing hyper-advanced architecture. \"One of the opportunities we have with the environments within our multiplayer experience is to visit places that you've never seen before in the Halo universe,\" said Holmes. \"We want to give you that wider view and show you places you my not encounter in the campaign. All the maps have been purpose-built for multiplayer \u2013 that gives us the optimal flow and balance.\" There has also been a suggestion that the Halo 4 multiplayer may contain narrative elements. In the past, the online experience has been somewhat separate from the story elements of the campaign mode. However, during a video in which interviews with several 343 Industries team members were featured, one suggested that the studio is creating a convicing reason why red Spartans fight blue Spartans. \"We really wanted to redefine what the multiplayer is,\" said Holmes. \"We wanted something that is definitely Halo at its core, something with that classic feel, but that has evolved in important and innovative ways. We've created a combat that is much more fast-paced, more intense and visceral than anything you've experienced before from a Halo game.\" Lots of interesting information then, hinting at a multiplayer mode that will hark back to classic Halo (hence the Battle rifle and fast-paced combat), while recognising industry-wide additions to the genre, such as character progression and social frameworks. No doubt we'll discover more at this year's E3 event. \u2022 Halo 4 is due for release on Xbox 360 in winter 2012",

      "bodyText": "Even when Sebastian Vettel is pinned against the side of the huge blue Red Bull motor home, with dozens of microphones and cameras pushed into his face, the winner of the last two Formula One drivers' championships manages to look both interested and mildly amused by such consuming attention. After one of his last sessions of testing at the Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona, with the new season beginning on Sunday week in Melbourne, Vettel answers the same old questions about his prospects of winning a third successive title with a patient little smile. At just 24 he looks every inch an old pro born for this role as a multiple world champion. It is only later, when darkness has blanketed the track and the roaring screams of competing cars have fallen silent, that Vettel seems able to relax and reveal something of his own passion and historical awareness of racing. In discussing Ayrton Senna and Juan Manuel Fangio, the great Argentinian driver who won five championships in the 1950s and with whom Vettel has recently been compared, the young German also pinpoints how his sport has changed. The terrible dangers have been curbed; but some of the glamour and pure exhilaration of Formula One has drained away. Vettel seems almost rueful that he drives in an era where corporate demands and the modern media have made racing a blander business. \"I watched Senna,\" Vettel says of last year's remarkable documentary on the Brazilian, \"and it was very inspiring to me. Maybe the film doesn't show you the entire story, the complete truth, but it was very inspirational to see the background and compare it to today. The driver briefings had lots of emotion.\" Does Vettel wish some of that same emotion pulsed through Formula One today? \"Yes. Definitely. It's different now. I'm not speaking badly of that time but if you compare racing then and now, 20 years later, then it's much more professional today. Now there's less room for \u2026\" Vettel pauses as he searches for the right word. \"Passion?\" I ask. \"Yes, maybe passion. I think we still have characters but there's less room and time to show that. It's unnatural today to go out with the other drivers and have a beer. If I did, and there were two or three drivers having a beer on a Saturday night \u2026\" Vettel shrugs in resignation at the consequences. \"Well, you wouldn't even want to imagine the fuss and the story it would create. And then if something goes wrong the next day for those three drivers then \u2026 woof! It's sad in one way but, in another way, the extreme professionalism now allows you to perform at an even higher level.\" Last season, Vettel reached an imperious level of professional brilliance. In 19 grands prix, he was on pole 15 times, reached the podium on 17 occasions and won 11 races \u2013 finishing 122 points clear of his closest rival, Jenson Button. \"We had a fantastic year,\" Vettel says. \"You don't have this kind of season very often. Even if you look at the seasons Michael [Schumacher] had, when dominating, we did something special. Statistics are not important but it's great when people remind you of this or that. But that's not why we are racing.\" Vettel insists he needs \"passion\" to \"survive\" in Formula One. \"It's the same as every other job, isn't it,\" he says in his immaculate English. \"You need passion to succeed. Yes, being a racing driver is a special job but, generally, if you don't like what you do then you're not going to be very good. You will face a point inside you where you think: 'Is this the right thing? Why am I doing this?' \"If you go to work every morning just because you need a cheque at the end of the month it's not great. Money can be a motivation but it will never make you happy. Obviously, racing in F1, all of us are very fortunate because we're doing something we loved as a child and now it's our job \u2013 and we earn good money. So for us, as drivers, it's great. And when you're successful it becomes even better. \"So, yes, last year was nearly faultless and if I see the steps the team has taken from 2009 to 2010 and then from 2010 to 2011 it's incredible. I think last year we didn't have a car as strong as 2010 \u2013 but we were stronger as a team. There were a couple of occasions where we made mistakes. Fridays have been poor. I made mistakes. I crashed the car. We got the concentration back when it mattered but on Fridays you only have a couple of hours to prepare the car \u2013 so we can improve on that. We had a meeting in January and went over the things that we need to do better and you would be surprised. It was a long list. There were lots of points to improve.\" That determination can be seen in Vettel's insistence on staying late into the night at the circuit with his mechanics \u2013 rather than slipping away for a more alluring meal in Barcelona. \"I would feel bad if I left early \u2013 even though it's just one test out of so many. Just because you know how to win a championship doesn't mean you forget all the small steps you take. \"I've just finished my debrief with the team and I could go off for dinner. But I won't. If the engine pops in a race I would feel bad and think maybe it was because I was lazy and didn't push 100%. If I make a mistake, OK, it happens. As long as I've done everything to be at the top of my game then I'm all right. That's why I'm happy to work late tonight.\" Vettel smiles his charming smile \u2013 and it's easy to see how different, and yet similar, he is to Schumacher. He offers much warmer and more amusing company. Yet Vettel, like Schumacher, puts in the additional graft that earns his team's reverence. Schumacher could seem cold to outsiders \u2013 but seeing him working late into the night with Ferrari's mechanics at Maranello was to understand why he engendered such loyalty. Vettel has the same knack. He also downplays his own role as a driver \u2013 even though racing's latest modifications suggest that Red Bull might not enjoy the same technical supremacy of the past two seasons. Surely driving ability will matter more now that the leading cars are likely to be closer? \"Mmmm,\" Vettel muses. \"No. I wouldn't go that far. It's not like racing in the wet where driver skill becomes more obvious. We lost downforce but everyone did \u2013 especially at lower-speed corners. The car is just not as quick as it used to be and you definitely feel less grip. \"The last two years we came up with some very clever solutions and it's normal that, after a while, people work out how to copy us. Last year we had a good car, even if it wasn't as far ahead as 2010, but rules change and that's part of Formula One. It's just a shame for the future if people have less room to be creative.\" Red Bull still have the best designer by a proverbial mile in Adrian Newey \u2013 and a driver in Vettel who seems to improve on his natural brilliance every season. \"Generally,\" he says laconically, \"the one who wins it the year before is usually among the favourites the next season.\" Would Vettel consider himself the outright favourite this year? \"Yes,\" he says simply. Such self-belief encouraged Stirling Moss to compare Vettel last month to his old rival, Fangio. \"It's very special,\" Vettel says of Moss's tribute. \"Stirling Moss [who is now 82] has seen a lot. I was pretty surprised by what he said. But I've met him a couple of times and he's one of the first heroes of F1. So it's a very big honour he mentions me in the same sentence as Fangio. \"I'm not a specialist when it comes to the history of Formula One but I've obviously heard about how special Fangio was. There aren't many people left who worked with Fangio or raced against him \u2013 but there is still Stirling Moss and the stories he tells. What he saw was pretty incredible and so, for me, it's a great compliment.\" Schumacher was Vettel's earliest inspiration. \"When I grew up Michael was a hero right across Germany. For all the kids racing in go-karts he was the one. I remember, once, there were 120 kids between eight and 12 years old and we were all trying to qualify for this race Michael organised. The final 34 got to compete in the race and it was a big deal because Michael waved the chequered flag. To be part of that was a dream \u2013 and to actually win it was the best thing that could ever happen.\" Did Vettel win that boyhood race? \"I finished seventh,\" he says with a grin, \"and the top seven each got a trophy so it made me very happy.\" Earlier, out on the track while testing, Vettel had flown past both Schumacher, racing again for Mercedes at the age of 43, and Bruno Senna in a Williams \u2013 for whom his illustrious uncle drove at the time of his tragic death in 1994. Last season Vettel followed Schumacher in becoming only the second driver to score more than 10 victories in a season. This year, if he wins another championship, he will equal Senna's three titles. Fangio's five championships, and even Schumacher's extraordinary record of seven, will seem a little closer. Will Vettel eventually move from Red Bull to Ferrari as he strives to emulate Schumacher? \"I don't know. If you look at Michael you can see how long you can race if you've got the passion. Michael's been around 20 years. I've been in F1 five years. Time goes by quickly but at the moment I can't think of a better place than this. I feel comfortable with the team and happy to work in such a great atmosphere. We're still hungry. We're still pushing for improvement. We're driven for more. We always want more. So at the moment I'm entirely happy. But, sure, one day, it would be a dream to drive for a team like Ferrari.\" Until then Vettel aspires to dominate another season in his Red Bull \u2013 which will again be named after a girl. Vettel has driven cars he's called Julie, Kate, Kate's Dirty Sister, Luscious Liz and Kinky Kylie. \"We don't know the name yet of the new car,\" he says of the RB8, \"but we've got a shortlist. It has to be a girl's name because I think the car is always nice and pretty and sexy.\" Yet this year, with Formula One's changed specifications producing cars that all have a less-than-sexy nose, surely Vettel might be tempted to name his car after an ugly man with a big hooter. \"Maybe a lady with a good chassis and a big nose?\" he quips. \"As long as it's another winner I won't mind \u2026\"",

      "body": "<p>Even when Sebastian Vettel is pinned against the side of the huge blue Red Bull motor home, with dozens of microphones and cameras pushed into his face, the winner of the last two Formula One drivers' championships manages to look both interested and mildly amused by such consuming attention.</p> <p>After one of his last sessions of testing at the Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona, with the new season beginning on Sunday week in Melbourne, Vettel answers the same old questions about his prospects of winning a third successive title with a patient little smile. At just 24 he looks every inch an old pro born for this role as a multiple world champion.</p> <p>It is only later, when darkness has blanketed the track and the roaring screams of competing cars have fallen silent, that Vettel seems able to relax and reveal something of his own passion and historical awareness of racing. In discussing Ayrton Senna and Juan Manuel Fangio, the great Argentinian driver who won five championships in the 1950s and with whom Vettel has recently been compared, the young German also pinpoints how his sport has changed.</p> <p>The terrible dangers have been curbed; but some of the glamour and pure exhilaration of Formula One has drained away. Vettel seems almost rueful that he drives in an era where corporate demands and the modern media have made racing a blander business. \"I watched Senna,\" Vettel says of last year's remarkable documentary on the Brazilian, \"and it was very inspiring to me. Maybe the film doesn't show you the entire story, the complete truth, but it was very inspirational to see the background and compare it to today. The driver briefings had lots of emotion.\"</p> <p>Does Vettel wish some of that same emotion pulsed through Formula One today? \"Yes. Definitely. It's different now. I'm not speaking badly of that time but if you compare racing then and now, 20 years later, then it's much more professional today. Now there's less room for \u2026\"</p> <p>Vettel pauses as he searches for the right word. \"Passion?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"Yes, maybe passion. I think we still have characters but there's less room and time to show that. It's unnatural today to go out with the other drivers and have a beer. If I did, and there were two or three drivers having a beer on a Saturday night \u2026\"</p> <p>Vettel shrugs in resignation at the consequences. \"Well, you wouldn't even want to imagine the fuss and the story it would create. And then if something goes wrong the next day for those three drivers then \u2026 woof! It's sad in one way but, in another way, the extreme professionalism now allows you to perform at an even higher level.\"</p> <p>Last season, Vettel reached an imperious level of professional brilliance. In 19 grands prix, he was on pole 15 times, reached the podium on 17 occasions and won 11 races \u2013 finishing 122 points clear of his closest rival, Jenson Button. \"We had a fantastic year,\" Vettel says. \"You don't have this kind of season very often. Even if you look at the seasons Michael [Schumacher] had, when dominating, we did something special. Statistics are not important but it's great when people remind you of this or that. But that's not why we are racing.\"</p> <p>Vettel insists he needs \"passion\" to \"survive\" in Formula One. \"It's the same as every other job, isn't it,\" he says in his immaculate English. \"You need passion to succeed. Yes, being a racing driver is a special job but, generally, if you don't like what you do then you're not going to be very good. You will face a point inside you where you think: 'Is this the right thing? Why am I doing this?'</p> <p>\"If you go to work every morning just because you need a cheque at the end of the month it's not great. Money can be a motivation but it will never make you happy. Obviously, racing in F1, all of us are very fortunate because we're doing something we loved as a child and now it's our job \u2013 and we earn good money. So for us, as drivers, it's great. And when you're successful it becomes even better.</p> <p>\"So, yes, last year was nearly faultless and if I see the steps the team has taken from 2009 to 2010 and then from 2010 to 2011 it's incredible. I think last year we didn't have a car as strong as 2010 \u2013 but we were stronger as a team. There were a couple of occasions where we made mistakes. Fridays have been poor. I made mistakes. I crashed the car. We got the concentration back when it mattered but on Fridays you only have a couple of hours to prepare the car \u2013 so we can improve on that. We had a meeting in January and went over the things that we need to do better and you would be surprised. It was a long list. There were lots of points to improve.\"</p> <p>That determination can be seen in Vettel's insistence on staying late into the night at the circuit with his mechanics \u2013 rather than slipping away for a more alluring meal in Barcelona. \"I would feel bad if I left early \u2013 even though it's just one test out of so many. Just because you know how to win a championship doesn't mean you forget all the small steps you take.</p> <p>\"I've just finished my debrief with the team and I could go off for dinner. But I won't. If the engine pops in a race I would feel bad and think maybe it was because I was lazy and didn't push 100%. If I make a mistake, OK, it happens. As long as I've done everything to be at the top of my game then I'm all right. That's why I'm happy to work late tonight.\"</p> <p>Vettel smiles his charming smile \u2013 and it's easy to see how different, and yet similar, he is to Schumacher. He offers much warmer and more amusing company. Yet Vettel, like Schumacher, puts in the additional graft that earns his team's reverence. Schumacher could seem cold to outsiders \u2013 but seeing him working late into the night with Ferrari's mechanics at Maranello was to understand why he engendered such loyalty. Vettel has the same knack.</p> <p>He also downplays his own role as a driver \u2013 even though racing's latest modifications suggest that Red Bull might not enjoy the same technical supremacy of the past two seasons. Surely driving ability will matter more now that the leading cars are likely to be closer? \"Mmmm,\" Vettel muses. \"No. I wouldn't go that far. It's not like racing in the wet where driver skill becomes more obvious. We lost downforce but everyone did \u2013 especially at lower-speed corners. The car is just not as quick as it used to be and you definitely feel less grip.</p> <p>\"The last two years we came up with some very clever solutions and it's normal that, after a while, people work out how to copy us. Last year we had a good car, even if it wasn't as far ahead as 2010, but rules change and that's part of Formula One. It's just a shame for the future if people have less room to be creative.\"</p> <p>Red Bull still have the best designer by a proverbial mile in Adrian Newey \u2013 and a driver in Vettel who seems to improve on his natural brilliance every season. \"Generally,\" he says laconically, \"the one who wins it the year before is usually among the favourites the next season.\"</p> <p>Would Vettel consider himself the outright favourite this year? \"Yes,\" he says simply.</p> <p>Such self-belief encouraged Stirling Moss to compare Vettel last month to his old rival, Fangio. \"It's very special,\" Vettel says of Moss's tribute. \"Stirling Moss [who is now 82] has seen a lot. I was pretty surprised by what he said. But I've met him a couple of times and he's one of the first heroes of F1. So it's a very big honour he mentions me in the same sentence as Fangio.</p> <p>\"I'm not a specialist when it comes to the history of Formula One but I've obviously heard about how special Fangio was. There aren't many people left who worked with Fangio or raced against him \u2013 but there is still Stirling Moss and the stories he tells.

      "bodyText": "Permafrost is soil that has remained below 0C (32F) for more than two years. It occurs in regions where the summer warmth fails to penetrate the ground sufficiently to thaw the soil. These conditions prevail in high-latitude or high-mountain areas that cover roughly a quarter of the Earth's land surface \u2013 including Alaska, Canada and Siberia. The thickness of permafrost ranges from a few metres to many hundreds of metres, depending on the local climate. Due to climate change, soil temperatures are rising. This can be seen in long-term borehole measurements from different permafrost zones, which show a significant warming trend during the past 30 years. The permafrost layer is thinned by warming, and disappears entirely if the warming is sufficiently great and sustained. In the near term, thawing permafrost can cause serious local problems \u2013 such as damaging or buildings and other infrastructure \u2013 but the larger concern around permafrost thaw relates to greenhouse gas emissions. Permafrost soils are extremely rich in organic carbon. According to one estimate they contain about 1700 billion tonnes of it \u2013 about twice the total amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere. When the soil remains deep-frozen, the carbon is largely inert, but when the permafrost thaws, the decomposition of organic matter through microbial activity increases sharply \u2013 with the consequence that large amounts of carbon will eventually get respired into the atmosphere as CO2 and (to a lesser extent) methane. This is an example of a positive feedback loop, because the greenhouse gases released by the thawing permafrost will exacerbate the warming, leading to more permafrost thawing, more warming, and so on. One recent study estimated that about one-tenth of the permafrost carbon pool might get released by 2100 under a scenario with strong future warming \u2013 equivalent to around twenty years of man-made CO2 emissions at current rates. More still would be released over subsequent centuries, and the process would not be readily reversible. \u2022 This article was written by Thomas Schneider von Deimling at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in conjunction with the Guardian and partners The ultimate climate change FAQ \u2022 This answer last updated: 01.03.2012 \u2022 Read about the project and suggest a question \u2022 Report an error in this answer \u2022 Browse all questions and answers Related questions \u2022 Are humans definitely causing global warming? \u2022 How much warmer will the planet get? \u2022 What are climate change feedback loops?

      "bodyText": "With news in the Guardian of government plans for police privatisation, the controversial Health and Social Care reforms and the flagship Work Programme being an area of real concern, it is time to ask whether the radical public service reform agenda of the coalition government is providing the answers that we need to overcome the challenges that are facing the welfare state in the twenty-first century. In launching Responsible Reform: Open Public Services for All, a report written by Voluntary Sector North West (VSNW) and the Centre for Local Economic Strategies (CLES), Warren Escadale, policy and research manager at VSNW, said: While the Big State has failed to create resilient communities, the evidence shows that the Small State is destroying what remains. This is surely a concern for all of us. The research, which involved discussions with over 240 voluntary and community sector organisations across the North West of England, showed that there has been a stripping away of specialist services, governance mechanisms and knowledge, leaving demonstrable growth in inequality as opposed to equality of opportunity. Furthermore, the austerity is having a terrifying impact upon organisations that are supposed to be leading the reforms under the banner of Big Society. A document leaked to the Guardian reveals that the most deprived 25% of the country will have been most severely hit by the end of this financial year, accounting for more than two-thirds of the spending cuts and with a disproportionate impact in the north. What is emerging from this is private sector monopolies delivering public service contracts, as seen through the Prime Contractor model of the Work Programme. Through this model, which the Government seems to be determined to extend into all areas of the welfare state, accountability rests not with the community, but rather with shareholders, with the only way for citizens to hold their public services to account through consumer-based choice. This will most likely favour the more privileged members of our society. Evidence is mounting to suggest that in its current guise, public service reform will not be open for all. The Government published the Open Public Services White Paper in the summer and should respond to consultations in the spring (although this response cannot be assured, as seen with an unanswered consultation process last year about support for the voluntary and community sector). The Open Public Services White Paper sets out a programme of radical reform to the welfare state and provides a framework for the transformation of the post-war welfare settlement. The north west research suggests that this will be neither effective nor efficient, and will widen inequalities in our society. In the age of austerity and with an aging population exerting more pressure on our public resources, there is a pressing need for a debate about the future of the welfare state, and an essential role for new and robust ideas. The Social Action &amp; Research Foundation (SARF) envision a different society than the one we are currently offered that privileges the market above all else. We want one in which the economy is made to work for society. In order to achieve this, our shared public services must be co-produced alongside communities contributing their essential knowledge to create an effective and accountable welfare state, which promotes active equality at a local level, and in which the voice of those experiencing poverty is truly valued.

      "bodyText": "With the long MLS off-season nearly over, fans throughout North America are eagerly awaiting the league's 17th season. We asked some of the most dedicated followers and commentators for each team to preview the season for us and the results are below. Today fans from the Eastern conference review last season's highlights and lowlights, respond to their team's off-season trades, and predict where their side will finish this year. The Western Conference fan preview will appear tomorrow. Chicago Fire Dan Martin, Section 8, Chicago What was the highlight of 2011? That would have to be reaching the US Open Cup Final. The team didn't win but it was an incredible run. The series of late-season successes going 7-2-1 (including the \"Capital Comeback\" at DC United) was very heartening to see, as well. . What was the low point? Setting a new league record for draws was pretty bad, but worse was missing the playoffs for the second season in a row after the aforementioned late-season surge. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? They're almost there. I would feel much more secure if there was another proven goal-scorer on the team, and a pair of unexpected player departures have left them slightly thin in central defense. I'm very excited to see how midfielder Rafael Robayo settles in with the rest of the squad - he could be the biggest signing of the off-season. What do you expect this season? The team will be much more competitive from the get-go than they were last year. A mid-season Designated Player signing isn't something I expect, but it wouldn't be too surprising, either. Where will the team finish? I'm never really one for making bold predictions, but I think the Fire will definitely challenge for the top spots in the East. Playoffs are a must... well, they're always a must, but even more so after missing out twice in a row and doing some serious rebuilding. Overall I think they'll be a team that none of the other teams in the league can afford to take lightly. Who will win the Eastern Conference? Ugh. I hate these questions. Can that be my answer? I'll just stay partisan and say FIRE. Who will win the MLS Cup? Fire. Columbus Crew Ben Hoelzel, VP of Crew Supporters Union What was the highlight of 2011? It is difficult to find a high point of a season filled with mediocrity, a third consecutive first-round playoff exit, and getting bumped from the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup by a USL squad. But the Crew did manage a fourth straight playoff appearance. And, after the the mass purging of the roster in the off-season, the team exceeded most peoples' expectations. What was the low point? Well, it was bound to happen eventually, but the Crew finally lost to Toronto FC last season. The Crew had never lost to TFC and losing 4-2 at home made the first time even worse, especially after losing 6-2 to former coach, Sigi Schmid, in Seattle the previous week. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? This has been one of the most active off-seasons in Crew history as the club looks to bolster an anaemic attack. The Crew has signed a true number ten in Milan Mirosevic, Costa Rican striker Olman Vargas, and homegrown forward and two time College Cup champion Ben Speas. The front office has done a fantastic job this winter, and Crewville is excited to see if all of these new parts come together to play attractive, attacking soccer and score some goals. What do you expect this season? With all of the moves both on-field and off-field this winter, expectations are high for 2012. If the team stays healthy, the new signings gel with the team, and younger players like Dilly Duka step-up, the Crew should be pushing for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. I also expect a lot more goals this season, and the Nordecke will fully expect to get past the first round of the playoffs. Where will the team finish? The team will finish third in a close race in the East, and seventh overall as the West continues to dominate. Who will win the Eastern Conference? It's a toss up. Really hard to tell and the most talented teams seem pretty young (DC, Philly, KC, Columbus) so a lot will depend on how some of the younger players come along. KC should be the strongest contender again this year, and DC and Chicago looked good late last season . But if I want to show my face in the Nordecke again, I have to say Columbus (hey, we have as good a chance as anyone else... except TFC, who has no chance). Who will win the MLS Cup? LA. This team is leveraged to win and win this year. They will be forced to break the team up after this year so it's now or never. DC United Kim Kolb, member of Screaming Eagles Supporters Group and author of NestLiner Blog What was the highlight of 2011? The match at Chivas USA where Charlie Davies scored a hat trick. A very dominating performance from United's offensive weapons. . What was the low point? The match at Chivas USA where Charlie Davies scored a hat trick... two thirds of the way through the match Chris Pontius suffered a broken leg and the offense didn't click again for the remainder of the season. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? The acquisition of Robbie Russell from Real Salt Lake brings a good veteran presence at right back (a void for several seasons). The signings of forward Hamidi Salihdi, and defender Emiliano Dudar both offer promise, but we'll need to see them in MLS play. What do you expect this season? Continued growth, especially in terms of character and team culture. The offseason roster cleansing should bring in a new attitude that isn't weighed down by past season disappointments. And, hopefully, that should lead to consistency in terms of on field results. Where will the team finish? First place overall and MLS Cup Champions! Or, more realistically, based on the roster moves: in the middle of the conference standings and a playoff berth. What happens in the playoffs is anyone's game. Who will win the Eastern Conference? Obviously these are stabs in the dark as it's nearly impossible to tell how offseason moves really impact a team until a few weeks in to the season but...Houston. Who will win the MLS Cup? ...LA. Houston Dynamo Zach Woosley, Managing Editor, Dynamo Theory blog What was the highlight of 2011? No question it was winning the Eastern Conference Championship and making MLS Cup 2011, after missing the playoffs the year before. What was the low point? September 10th, 2011. Houston loses 3-0 to Sporting KC and looks terrible in the process. If there was a point during the season when fans genuinely worried we might miss the playoffs again, that was it. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? The addition of Nathan Sturgis adds depth to the defensive midfield, while Colin Rolfe (drafted) and Macoumba Kandji (trade) should help the attack. More importantly, Brian Ching is back with a more cap friendly salary and it only cost a conditional draft pick. What do you expect this season? I think the Dynamo still have some questions to answer, but based on off-season moves and preseason matches, the potential is there for this 2012 version of the team to be much better than last season. The defense is in great shape. If the Dynamo can score goals they should easily finish with more points than 2011. Where will the team finish? 2nd in the Eastern Conference, 5th overall - though the new unbalanced schedule makes predicting an overall finish tricky. Who will win the Eastern Conference? Sporting Kansas City. Who will win the MLS Cup? Sporting Kansas City Sporting Kansas City Sean Dane, Kansas City Cauldron Hype Man What was the highlight of 2011? This is a two part answer. First is what is arguably the highlight of the franchise - the opening of our own stadium. Livestrong Sporting Park has changed the face of the game in the city. We have a home, forever. Second (and this is a purely personal moment, but one that was echoed by many long time fans), the home leg of the playoffs vs Colorado. Yes we won in dominating fashion, but that's not the highlight. On a frigid and rainy Wednesday night a sell out crowd of almost 19k piled into LSP. There were times in the game when all 19k were singing in unison. This is something from the dreams of every person that has ever put effort into supporting this team. . What was the low point? Easy, losing to Houston and not heading to the MLS final. The bright side is we are hungrier than ever both on the field and in the stands. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? Its hard to argue with Peter Vermes draft selection ability over the years. Its going to be interesting to see what Convey does playing back in the position he always liked. As far as Dom Dwyer, I will quote PV: \"He's a 'effin beast\". How worried would you be if our offense was coming at you? What do you expect this season? Expectations are high after last years performance. We want the hardware - nothing less. Where will the team finish? Its going to get crazy at the end of the year with the new schedule. Each game is so heavily weighted in the conference now. After the smoke clears we will be on top. The guys know the importance of home field advantage in the playoffs and the top spot is already on everyone's mind. Who will win the Eastern Conference? Sporting Kansas City. Who will win the MLS Cup? Sporting Kansas City. Montreal Impact Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9guin, 127 Montr\u00e9al What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? As far as the off-season went, I think we've put together a competitive team, though the real concern is on offense. We like the way the team is built - that is, from the keeper out through the midfield. A lot of experience in key positions. As for the draft, most people like the choice of Wenger, even though we got to see Mattocks the other night in pre-season action. Since we're lacking some offensive punch, it would be easy to say we should have taken Mattocks, but time will tell whether Wenger was a good choice or not. Overall though, we don't really care much for the draft, as we don't see it as the way to build our club. Montreal will look more towards building through our academy and finding established players both locally and overseas. It's an Impact club thing; we haven't really relied on any sort of draft system in the past. What do you expect this season? Our expectations aren't particularly high, in the sense that we are an expansion side and we don't expect by any means to make a run at the MLS Cup. We do, however, hope to make a serious run for the Voyageurs Cup. That, more than the MLS season, will likely determine the success of our first year at the top flight. Where will the team finish? Probably not too far out of a playoff spot, and hopefully not at the bottom of the table. Who will win the Eastern Conference? Houston. Who will win the MLS Cup? Seattle. New England Revolution Christopher Camille, Secretary, Midnight Riders What was the highlight of 2011? When it was over. It was a terrible season. If I had to pick one it would be the MLS debut of homegrown youngster Diego Fagundez. He came off the bench, drew a penalty and scored a goal of his own. For a 16 year-old local kid it was special. What was the low point? One could argue that the season was one big low point. On the field, the Revs only won five games, lost six of their last seven and managed to only muster a draw at PPL Park in Chester, PA after leading 4-1. Off the field, already frosty relations between the supporters who occupy the Fort and the Front Office continued to struggle - culminating in the event now known as \"Fortgate,\" that saw supporters arrested during a match. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? As one of the worst teams in the league you would have expected more activity and hopefully a top player or two. That hasn't happened, but Heaps does deserve some credit for the draft (Kelyn Rowe could be a real star) and the urgency with which he has looked to improve the back end depth of the team. What do you expect this season? If nothing changes I expect only a very slight improvement over last season. Heaps' energy and attention to detail (the Revs finally have their own weight room and Fitness coach) will allow the team to avoid the late game collapse that became all too common last year. The Revs will struggle to score goals, but have the makings of a decent back line and ball-controlling midfield. Where will the team finish? Hopefully the Revs will finish above Montreal and avoid the basement in the Eastern Conference. Who will win the Eastern Conference? Houston. Who will win the MLS Cup? Seattle. New York Red Bulls Dave Martinez, proprietor of Empire of Soccer, beat writer for Soccer By Ives, Host of Seeing Red. What was the highlight of 2011? The 2-0 wildcard victory in Dallas. What was the low point? After a disappointing performance against Real Salt Lake late in the season (a 3-1 loss), Rafa Marquez let loose on a reeling Red Bulls side. Labeling Tim Ream's play \"infantile\" and claiming his teammates were below his level, Marquez caused a rift that created a toxic atmosphere in the locker room and a cloud over the final crucial matches. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? Off-season acquisitions like Markus Holgersson and Wilman Conde will provide the physicality at center back Coach Hans Backe desperately needed to compete last season. Victor Palsson is a good young pickup that will give cover for the times where the oft injured Teemu Tainio and Rafa Marquez are unavailable. The lack of a veteran goalkeeper, however, is a huge concern; as of now, they are trusting their team to an unproven rookie and a second year professional out of the Finnish second division. A serviceable attacking midfielder has once again eluded them, which will put the goal scoring burden on Henry. What do you expect this season? It is difficult to say. Overall, the team has been fortified. However, the lack of a veteran keeper is a major concern. Luke Rodgers was key to the attack, but is not yet certain to return due to visa issues. Conde is coming off of major surgery to his left instep. Though the side has kept the core of its starting XI intact, there haven't been any starting options added to the an aging midfield. That said, they are still a playoff side, especially in a weak Eastern Conference. Where will the team finish? I would expect a top two finish in the East, but as currently constituted, an unproven keeper will haunt them in the playoffs. I would be surprised to see New York advance past the conference semifinals. Who will win the Eastern Conference? Sporting KC Who will win the MLS Cup? Real Salt Lake Philadelphia Union Corey Furlan, VP of Sons of Ben What was the highlight of 2011? Making the play-offs, second year in the league, was a pretty big deal for a new franchise. For an individual game highlight, the game where we were 4-1 down to New England at half time and came back to draw 4-4 was quite a turning point, as we hadn't won in a couple of months. We won the next game and didn't look back. The best and worst game of soccer I've ever seen! . What was the low point? The lowest point of the season was right before that New England game, when we hadn't won for a couple of months. Our leading goalscorer Ruiz left and everyone was wondering where the goals were going to come from. Harvey was traded too and we didn't know what was going on. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? How do I want to put this? Losing Mondragon and Le Toux is obviously a tough thing to wrap your head around as a fan. But I do believe that those moves are going to allow the team to be better. It allows us to add a couple of pieces that mean that this year's team will be better than last year's. As a fan, seeing Le Toux go, as the person who scored the first ever franchise MLS goal, stings a little. But now it's time for Mwanga to show his mettle, now he's off Generation Adidas and on the books. Though maybe the best acquisition will be Gabriel G\u00f3mez. He's a big central midfielder who's looked great in pre-season and we'll see how he does. What do you expect this season? I think they're going to go further in the play-offs than they did last year - I think the East is wide open. I think Kansas City is good, Houston is good, but there's nobody that's that far away from us. I'm not just saying it because I don't like them, but the Red Bulls - not that good. Where will the team finish? 2nd or 3rd in the East. Eastern Conference Final Who will win the Eastern Conference? Sporting KC. Who will win the MLS Cup? LA. Toronto FC Boris Aguilar, Executive Member, Red Patch Boys What was the highlight of 2011? Last season was another rough season for the Reds. I think that our highlight came very late in the season and did not even come from regular MLS play, but from the CONCACAF Champions League. With a less than stellar away record, we were in a win or out situation against Dallas in the group phase. Plata had a great game and lifted the Reds to a convincing victory, which allowed TFC to advance to the quarter finals. What was the low point? Last season was seen as a rebuilding season, so there were pretty low expectations for the team. As a supporter you always expect the best from your team though, so the low point of our season would likely be the day that we were mathematically disqualified from the playoffs. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? TFC made some great strides in the off season to address some major gaps in their line-up. Overall, I'm fairly happy with the pick ups we had. I think we are a much stronger team coming out of the off season. The pick up I'm looking forward to seeing the most would likely be the signing of Chilean defender Miguel Aceval. What do you expect this season? Last year was seen as a rebuilding season and after making some good pick ups I would have to say that this season we should be able to have a great run at the Champions League and at the very least make our first play offs. I would sincerely be disappointed if we cant achieve this. Where will the team finish? I think that we can make a real impact in the league and can, at the very least make the play offs. 4th Who will win the Eastern Conference? DC. Who will win the MLS Cup? I can see LA getting the back to back, with the caveat that I want to say Toronto. Eastern Conference: the Guardian view Western Conference: the Guardian view",

We asked some of the most dedicated followers and commentators for each team to preview the season for us and the results are below.</p> <p>Today fans from the Eastern conference review last season's highlights and lowlights, respond to their team's off-season trades, and predict where their side will finish this year. The Western Conference fan preview will appear tomorrow.</p> <h2>Chicago Fire</h2> <p>Dan Martin, <a href=\"http://www.section8chicago.com\">Section 8</a>, Chicago</p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>That would have to be reaching the US Open Cup Final. The team didn't win but it was an incredible run. The series of late-season successes going 7-2-1 (including the \"Capital Comeback\" at DC United) was very heartening to see, as well.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XYjktKdtZ7Y?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XYjktKdtZ7Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.<br><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>Setting a new league record for draws was pretty bad, but worse was missing the playoffs for the second season in a row after the aforementioned late-season surge.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>They're almost there. I would feel much more secure if there was another proven goal-scorer on the team, and a pair of unexpected player departures have left them slightly thin in central defense. I'm very excited to see how midfielder Rafael Robayo settles in with the rest of the squad - he could be the biggest signing of the off-season.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>The team will be much more competitive from the get-go than they were last year. A mid-season Designated Player signing isn't something I expect, but it wouldn't be too surprising, either.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>I'm never really one for making bold predictions, but I think the Fire will definitely challenge for the top spots in the East. Playoffs are a must... well, they're always a must, but even more so after missing out twice in a row and doing some serious rebuilding. Overall I think they'll be a team that none of the other teams in the league can afford to take lightly.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>Ugh. I hate these questions. Can that be my answer? I'll just stay partisan and say FIRE.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>Fire.</p> <h2>Columbus Crew</h2> <p>Ben Hoelzel, VP of <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Supporters Union</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>It is difficult to find a high point of a season filled with mediocrity, a third consecutive first-round playoff exit, and getting bumped from the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup by a USL squad. But the Crew did manage a fourth straight playoff appearance. And, after the the mass purging of the roster in the off-season, the team exceeded most peoples' expectations. </p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>Well, it was bound to happen eventually, but the Crew finally lost to Toronto FC last season. The Crew had never lost to TFC and losing 4-2 at home made the first time even worse, especially after losing 6-2 to former coach, Sigi Schmid, in Seattle the previous week. </p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>This has been one of the most active off-seasons in Crew history as the club looks to bolster an anaemic attack. The Crew has signed a true number ten in Milan Mirosevic, Costa Rican striker Olman Vargas, and homegrown forward and two time College Cup champion Ben Speas. The front office has done a fantastic job this winter, and Crewville is excited to see if all of these new parts come together to play attractive, attacking soccer and score some goals.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>With all of the moves both on-field and off-field this winter, expectations are high for 2012. If the team stays healthy, the new signings gel with the team, and younger players like Dilly Duka step-up, the Crew should be pushing for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. I also expect a lot more goals this season, and the Nordecke will fully expect to get past the first round of the playoffs. </p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>The team will finish third in a close race in the East, and seventh overall as the West continues to dominate.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>It's a toss up. Really hard to tell and the most talented teams seem pretty young (DC, Philly, KC, Columbus) so a lot will depend on how some of the younger players come along. KC should be the strongest contender again this year, and DC and Chicago looked good late last season . But if I want to show my face in the Nordecke again, I have to say Columbus (hey, we have as good a chance as anyone else... except TFC, who has no chance).</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>LA. This team is leveraged to win and win this year. They will be forced to break the team up after this year so it's now or never.</p> <h2>DC United</h2> <p>Kim Kolb, member of <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com\">Screaming Eagles Supporters Group</a> and author of NestLiner Blog</p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011? </strong><br>The match at Chivas USA where Charlie Davies scored a hat trick. A very dominating performance from United's offensive weapons.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/woy_D_TUmAQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/woy_D_TUmAQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.<br><strong>What was the low point? </strong><br>The match at Chivas USA where Charlie Davies scored a hat trick... two thirds of the way through the match Chris Pontius suffered a broken leg and the offense didn't click again for the remainder of the season.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? </strong><br>The acquisition of Robbie Russell from Real Salt Lake brings a good veteran presence at right back (a void for several seasons). The signings of forward Hamidi Salihdi, and defender Emiliano Dudar both offer promise, but we'll need to see them in MLS play.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season? </strong><br>Continued growth, especially in terms of character and team culture. The offseason roster cleansing should bring in a new attitude that isn't weighed down by past season disappointments. And, hopefully, that should lead to consistency in terms of on field results.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish? </strong><br>First place overall and MLS Cup Champions! Or, more realistically, based on the roster moves: in the middle of the conference standings and a playoff berth. What happens in the playoffs is anyone's game.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>Obviously these are stabs in the dark as it's nearly impossible to tell how offseason moves really impact a team until a few weeks in to the season but...Houston.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>...LA.</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo</h2> <p>Zach Woosley, Managing Editor, <a href=\"http://dynamotheory.com\">Dynamo Theory blog</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>No question it was winning the Eastern Conference Championship and making MLS Cup 2011, after missing the playoffs the year before.</p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>September 10th, 2011. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ud1vfUARNac\">Houston loses 3-0 to Sporting KC</a> and looks terrible in the process. If there was a point during the season when fans genuinely worried we might miss the playoffs again, that was it.<br><strong><br>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>The addition of Nathan Sturgis adds depth to the defensive midfield, while Colin Rolfe (drafted) and Macoumba Kandji (trade) should help the attack. More importantly, Brian Ching is back with a more cap friendly salary and it only cost a conditional draft pick.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>I think the Dynamo still have some questions to answer, but based on off-season moves and preseason matches, the potential is there for this 2012 version of the team to be much better than last season. The defense is in great shape. If the Dynamo can score goals they should easily finish with more points than 2011.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>2nd in the Eastern Conference, 5th overall - though the new unbalanced schedule makes predicting an overall finish tricky.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>Sporting Kansas City.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>Sporting Kansas City</p> <h2>Sporting Kansas City</h2> <p>Sean Dane, <a href=\"http://kccauldron.com\">Kansas City Cauldron</a> Hype Man</p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>This is a two part answer. First is what is arguably the highlight of the franchise - the opening of our own stadium. Livestrong Sporting Park has changed the face of the game in the city. We have a home, forever. Second (and this is a purely personal moment, but one that was echoed by many long time fans), the home leg of the playoffs vs Colorado. Yes we won in dominating fashion, but that's not the highlight. On a frigid and rainy Wednesday night a sell out crowd of almost 19k piled into LSP. There were times in the game when all 19k were singing in unison. This is something from the dreams of every person that has ever put effort into supporting this team. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O1tCo6q2So?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O1tCo6q2So\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.<br>What was the low point? </p> <p>Easy, losing to Houston and not heading to the MLS final. The bright side is we are hungrier than ever both on the field and in the stands. </p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>Its hard to argue with Peter Vermes draft selection ability over the years. Its going to be interesting to see what Convey does playing back in the position he always liked. As far as Dom Dwyer, I will quote PV: \"He's a 'effin beast\". How worried would you be if our offense was coming at you?</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>Expectations are high after last years performance. We want the hardware - nothing less. </p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>Its going to get crazy at the end of the year with the new schedule. Each game is so heavily weighted in the conference now. After the smoke clears we will be on top. The guys know the importance of home field advantage in the playoffs and the top spot is already on everyone's mind.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>Sporting Kansas City.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>Sporting Kansas City.</p> <h2>Montreal Impact</h2> <p>Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9guin, <a href=\"http://www.127montreal.com\">127 Montr\u00e9al</a></p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>As far as the off-season went, I think we've put together a competitive team, though the real concern is on offense. We like the way the team is built - that is, from the keeper out through the midfield. A lot of experience in key positions.</p> <p>As for the draft, most people like the choice of Wenger, even though we got to see Mattocks the other night in pre-season action. Since we're lacking some offensive punch, it would be easy to say we should have taken Mattocks, but time will tell whether Wenger was a good choice or not. Overall though, we don't really care much for the draft, as we don't see it as the way to build our club. Montreal will look more towards building through our academy and finding established players both locally and overseas. It's an Impact club thing; we haven't really relied on any sort of draft system in the past.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>Our expectations aren't particularly high, in the sense that we are an expansion side and we don't expect by any means to make a run at the MLS Cup. We do, however, hope to make a serious run for the Voyageurs Cup. That, more than the MLS season, will likely determine the success of our first year at the top flight.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>Probably not too far out of a playoff spot, and hopefully not at the bottom of the table.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>Houston.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>Seattle.</p> <h2>New England Revolution</h2> <p>Christopher Camille, Secretary, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com\">Midnight Riders</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>When it was over. It was a terrible season. If I had to pick one it would be the MLS debut of homegrown youngster Diego Fagundez. He came off the bench, drew a penalty and scored a goal of his own. For a 16 year-old local kid it was special.</p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>One could argue that the season was one big low point. On the field, the Revs only won five games, lost six of their last seven and managed to only muster a draw at PPL Park in Chester, PA after leading 4-1. Off the field, already frosty relations between the supporters who occupy the Fort and the Front Office continued to struggle - culminating in the event now known as \"Fortgate,\" that saw supporters arrested during a match.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>As one of the worst teams in the league you would have expected more activity and hopefully a top player or two. That hasn't happened, but Heaps does deserve some credit for the draft (Kelyn Rowe could be a real star) and the urgency with which he has looked to improve the back end depth of the team.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>If nothing changes I expect only a very slight improvement over last season. Heaps' energy and attention to detail (the Revs finally have their own weight room and Fitness coach) will allow the team to avoid the late game collapse that became all too common last year. The Revs will struggle to score goals, but have the makings of a decent back line and ball-controlling midfield.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>Hopefully the Revs will finish above Montreal and avoid the basement in the Eastern Conference.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>Houston.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>Seattle.</p> <h2>New York Red Bulls</h2> <p>Dave Martinez, proprietor of <a href=\"http://empireofsoccer.com\">Empire of Soccer</a>, beat writer for <a href=\"http://soccerbyives.net\">Soccer By Ives</a>, Host of <a href=\"http://seeingredny.com\">Seeing Red</a>.</p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>The 2-0 wildcard victory in Dallas.</p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>After a disappointing performance against Real Salt Lake late in the season (a 3-1 loss), Rafa Marquez let loose on a reeling Red Bulls side. Labeling Tim Ream's play \"infantile\" and claiming his teammates were below his level, Marquez caused a rift that created a toxic atmosphere in the locker room and a cloud over the final crucial matches.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>Off-season acquisitions like Markus Holgersson and Wilman Conde will provide the physicality at center back Coach Hans Backe desperately needed to compete last season. Victor Palsson is a good young pickup that will give cover for the times where the oft injured Teemu Tainio and Rafa Marquez are unavailable. The lack of a veteran goalkeeper, however, is a huge concern; as of now, they are trusting their team to an unproven rookie and a second year professional out of the Finnish second division. A serviceable attacking midfielder has once again eluded them, which will put the goal scoring burden on Henry.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>It is difficult to say. Overall, the team has been fortified. However, the lack of a veteran keeper is a major concern. Luke Rodgers was key to the attack, but is not yet certain to return due to visa issues. Conde is coming off of major surgery to his left instep. Though the side has kept the core of its starting XI intact, there haven't been any starting options added to the an aging midfield. That said, they are still a playoff side, especially in a weak Eastern Conference.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>I would expect a top two finish in the East, but as currently constituted, an unproven keeper will haunt them in the playoffs. I would be surprised to see New York advance past the conference semifinals.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>Sporting KC</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>Real Salt Lake</p> <h2>Philadelphia Union</h2> <p>Corey Furlan, VP of <a href=\"http://beta.sonsofben.com\">Sons of Ben</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>Making the play-offs, second year in the league, was a pretty big deal for a new franchise. For an individual game highlight, the game where we were 4-1 down to New England at half time and came back to draw 4-4 was quite a turning point, as we hadn't won in a couple of months. We won the next game and didn't look back. The best and worst game of soccer I've ever seen! </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QDrjvi17uk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QDrjvi17uk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.<br><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>The lowest point of the season was right before that New England game, when we hadn't won for a couple of months. Our leading goalscorer Ruiz left and everyone was wondering where the goals were going to come from. Harvey was traded too and we didn't know what was going on.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>How do I want to put this? Losing Mondragon and Le Toux is obviously a tough thing to wrap your head around as a fan. But I do believe that those moves are going to allow the team to be better. It allows us to add a couple of pieces that mean that this year's team will be better than last year's. As a fan, seeing Le Toux go, as the person who scored the first ever franchise MLS goal, stings a little. But now it's time for Mwanga to show his mettle, now he's off Generation Adidas and on the books. Though maybe the best acquisition will be Gabriel G\u00f3mez. He's a big central midfielder who's looked great in pre-season and we'll see how he does.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>I think they're going to go further in the play-offs than they did last year - I think the East is wide open. I think Kansas City is good, Houston is good, but there's nobody that's that far away from us. I'm not just saying it because I don't like them, but the Red Bulls - not that good.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>2nd or 3rd in the East. Eastern Conference Final</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>Sporting KC.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>LA.</p> <h2>Toronto FC</h2> <p>Boris Aguilar, Executive Member, <a href=\"http://redpatchboys.ca\">Red Patch Boys</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>Last season was another rough season for the Reds. I think that our highlight came very late in the season and did not even come from regular MLS play, but from the CONCACAF Champions League. With a less than stellar away record, we were in a win or out situation against Dallas in the group phase. Plata had a great game and lifted the Reds to a convincing victory, which allowed TFC to advance to the quarter finals.<br><strong><br>What was the low point?</strong><br>Last season was seen as a rebuilding season, so there were pretty low expectations for the team. As a supporter you always expect the best from your team though, so the low point of our season would likely be the day that we were mathematically disqualified from the playoffs.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>TFC made some great strides in the off season to address some major gaps in their line-up. Overall, I'm fairly happy with the pick ups we had. I think we are a much stronger team coming out of the off season. The pick up I'm looking forward to seeing the most would likely be the signing of Chilean defender Miguel Aceval.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>Last year was seen as a rebuilding season and after making some good pick ups I would have to say that this season we should be able to have a great run at the Champions League and at the very least make our first play offs. I would sincerely be disappointed if we cant achieve this.<br><strong><br>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>I think that we can make a real impact in the league and can, at the very least make the play offs. 4th</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Eastern Conference?</strong><br>DC.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>I can see LA getting the back to back, with the caveat that I want to say Toronto.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/mar/01/mls-2012-season-preview-eastern-conference\"><br>Eastern Conference: the Guardian view</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/mar/02/mls-2012-season-preview-western-conference\">Western Conference: the Guardian view</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Documents have been discovered that apparently confirm police claims that the Labour government was secretly briefed about the significance of the phone-hacking arrests at the News of the World in 2006, the Leveson inquiry has been told. Two Metropolitan police reports were sent to the Home Office on 9 August 2006, one of which was prepared for the home secretary, the inquiry heard when it resumed on Monday morning. This followed the police discovery that Labour cabinet ministers were having their voicemail messages targeted. Both Tessa Jowell and John Prescott, at the time culture secretary and deputy prime minister, respectively, were known to have been targets. One police report was handed over to Leveson over the weekend, and the second, written by Richard Riley, private secretary to the permanent secretary, \"prepared by a senior civil servant for the home secretary personally\" was being sought. \"It's obviously very important,\" Lord Justice Leveson told Neil Garnham QC, counsel representing the Met at the inquiry. The existence of the reports appears to clash with claims by former home secretary John Reid to the Guardian at the weekend that he was never made aware that Labour MPs were being targeted by the News of the World. He said on Friday evening: \"I can categorically say that I did not receive any briefing from the Met suggesting that there was widespread hacking including MPs and the deputy PM.\" Clarke told the inquiry under oath on Thursday: \"I am absolutely clear in my mind that HM government was fully aware of this case at the time .... I recall discussing the case with Dr John Reid, the then home secretary, shortly after Goodman and Mulcaire had been arrested. This was in the margins of a meeting about broader counter-terrorism issues ... the Home Office had been informed of the arrests and the broad nature of the case that was alleged against Goodman and Mulcaire.\" He was asked: \"Did you make is clear to him that although the investigation had clearly and conclusively implicated Goodman and Mulcaire, (a) the range of victims was far wider than the royal household, and (b) that other journalists might well have been involved?\" He answered: \"I think it did. I don't remember the exact content of that discussion. I know that a briefing paper went from the Metropolitan police to the Home Office and that Dr Reid was aware of it and it was on the basis of that that he asked me some questions.\" Asked about police failure to brief Prescott that he was a hacking target, Clarke testified: \"It wouldn't be for me to go direct to Lord Prescott. I discussed this with the then home secretary, Dr Reid. He was aware of the investigation.\" Leveson also called on the police on Monday to find documentation about their dealings with Jowell. Sara Mansoori, the lawyer representing the \"core participant\" victims, raised the issue on behalf of the former culture secretary on Monday challenging police allegations that she had been unwilling to sign a witness statement to assist with the prosecution of News of the World journalists. Jowell was the first cabinet minister who it was discovered was a News of the World target, prior to the arrest of private detective Glenn Mulcaire on 8 August 2006. Leveson asked for records to be found of which senior police officer visited Jowell at the time, to discuss possible prosecutions. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Both Tessa Jowell and John Prescott, at the time culture secretary and deputy prime minister, respectively, were known to have been targets.</p> <p>One police report was handed over to Leveson over the weekend, and the second, written by Richard Riley, private secretary to the permanent secretary, \"prepared by a senior civil servant for the home secretary personally\" was being sought.</p> <p>\"It's obviously very important,\" Lord Justice Leveson told Neil Garnham QC, counsel representing the Met at the inquiry.</p> <p>The existence of the reports appears to clash with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/02/tony-blair-phone-hacking-police\" title=\"\">claims by former home secretary John Reid to the Guardian at the weekend</a> that he was never made aware that Labour MPs were being targeted by the News of the World.</p> <p>He said on Friday evening: \"I can categorically say that I did not receive any briefing from the Met suggesting that there was widespread hacking including MPs and the deputy PM.\"</p> <p>Clarke told the inquiry under oath on Thursday: \"I am absolutely clear in my mind that HM government was fully aware of this case at the time .... I recall discussing the case with Dr John Reid, the then home secretary, shortly after Goodman and Mulcaire had been arrested. This was in the margins of a meeting about broader counter-terrorism issues ... the Home Office had been informed of the arrests and the broad nature of the case that was alleged against Goodman and Mulcaire.\"</p> <p>He was asked: \"Did you make is clear to him that although the investigation had clearly and conclusively implicated Goodman and Mulcaire, (a) the range of victims was far wider than the royal household, and (b) that other journalists might well have been involved?\"</p> <p>He answered: \"I think it did. I don't remember the exact content of that discussion. I know that a briefing paper went from the Metropolitan police to the Home Office and that Dr Reid was aware of it and it was on the basis of that that he asked me some questions.\"</p> <p>Asked about police failure to brief Prescott that he was a hacking target, Clarke testified: \"It wouldn't be for me to go direct to Lord Prescott. I discussed this with the then home secretary, Dr Reid. He was aware of the investigation.\"</p> <p>Leveson also called on the police on Monday to find documentation about their dealings with Jowell. Sara Mansoori, the lawyer representing the \"core participant\" victims, raised the issue on behalf of the former culture secretary on Monday challenging police allegations that she had been unwilling to sign a witness statement to assist with the prosecution of News of the World journalists.</p> <p>Jowell was the first cabinet minister who it was discovered was a News of the World target, prior to the arrest of private detective Glenn Mulcaire on 8 August 2006. Leveson asked for records to be found of which senior police officer visited Jowell at the time, to discuss possible prosecutions.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

In recent weeks MPs have been allowed to skip Westminster as the parties impose a one line whip on most business. This means that MPs are expected to vote in favour of the government or opposition line but can busy themselves in their constituencies if they prefer. Most of the heavy lifting in recent weeks has taken place in the House of Lords. Last week peers allowed the welfare reform bill to pass its final stages after a bumpy ride. On Tuesday Labour and some Liberal Democrat peers will be challenging the level of competition in the health and social care bill. Today's business in the House of Commons is pretty typical of the light load. This is what we can expect: 2.35pm: The monthly session of questions to Iain Duncan Smith and his ministerial team at the department of work and pensions 3.30pm: Statement by David Cameron on last week's European Council Sometime after 4.30pm two opposition day debates by the Labour party on: : Jobs and growth in a low carbon economy : Living standards 10pm: Adjournment debate by Graeme Morrice on the golden anniversary of Livingston New Town Parliament may be taking life easy. But there is clearly a thirst for political debate beyond the Westminster village. Alistair Darling spoke to a packed house on Saturday about his book, Back from the Brink, at the Words by the Water book festival in Keswick in the Lake District. As I tweeted from the festival on Saturday, Darling made some fascinating observations. He described the eurozone fiscal compat as \"absolute madness\" and warned that it would institutionalise recession in some parts of Europe. The audience asked Darling questions which focused on substance and not the usual process issues of who's up and who's down which form the daily diet of political journalists. So why is parliament snoozing and formal political meetings so badly attended while book festivals show voters clearly have an appetite for politics? There are lively debates beyond Westminster because: \u2022 Voters are fascinated by politics but are turned off by speak-your-weight machine politicians. Retired politicians who write honestly about their experience have an enthusiastic audience. Active politicians reading from a script, or memorising party lines, send voters to sleep. \u2022 Humour works. Chris Mullin was one of the stars on Saturday at the Words by the Water Festival as he talked of the latest instalment of his diaries, A Walk-on Part. These are the third in the series of Britain's best political diaries since the publication of the mischievous Alan Clark diaries. Mullin was funny and self effacing as he told of how, as a junior foreign office minister, he made occasional visits to what he called the \"stratosphere\" \u2013 the land occupied by prime ministers and presidents. Parliament is snoozing because: \u2022 The coalition is effectively a one goal government \u2013 tackling the structural deficit. Most of the major reforms which require legislation \u2013 welfare, schools and health \u2013 have either been passed or are about to be passed. \u2022 David Cameron believes that Labour mistakenly thought it could measure its success by the amount of bills it passed. The prime minister believes success should be measured by outcomes. Sometimes these need legislation (schools) but sometimes they do not (health). He knows he slipped up on the latter by allowing Andrew Lansley to introduce what No 10 now regards as completely pointless and counter-productive piece of legislation. Matthew d'Ancona, who reflects and shapes Cameron's thinking, touched on this in his Sunday Telegraph column on Steve Hilton column at the weekend: In truth, the next Queen's Speech, due on May 9, should read as follows: \"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons. My Government will introduce no major legislation until it has fully implemented the measures already taken since 2010. I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels.\" Now that really would be radical. What better leaving present for Steve? There is one person working hard to ensure that the House of Commons does not doze of completely. John Bercow, the speaker, has transformed the relationship between backbenchers and the executive by forcing ministers to come to the commons more often to answer urgent questions on contemporary issue. He is also extending the length of ministerial statements. Perhaps Bercow is one of the few active politicians who could enthuse a book festival.",

      "bodyText": "We sometimes congratulate ourselves on avoiding the excesses of America's culture wars where differences over religious faith, sexuality or even the right to own and carry guns routinely lead to people being murdered, ostensibly to protect the sanctity of human life or an 18th-century construction on the US constitution. But how well are we doing closer to home? Marriage has been back in the firing line this weekend, not that it's ever out of the trenches for very long. The Office for National Statistics reported last week that there were 8,657 more of them last year \u2013 241,100 \u2013 than in 2010, proof that a resurgence (so the Daily Mail concluded) of marriage is under way and could be strengthened if you-know-who had the bottle to defy his Lib Dem partners (it's only a coalition, they're not married) and give married couples a token tax break. Cue predictable anger about unmarried couples and singletons being marginalised (France has just dropped \"mademoiselle\" from official papers), along with all the other designated marginalised groups in society we all have to worry about. As the Lib Dem equalities minister, Lynne Featherstone, explained in a typically bouncy interview with the Times, married people are already admired enough (she's a divorcee), so \"why give it a bonus?\" It's all part of an ever-changing debate about family and the individual in society, the role and nature of the state (Swedes apparently see their social contract as being the state and the individual, not the family) and competing visions of morality in a country whose cities are culturally diverse but who countless towns and villages are much less so. Another symptom of wider confusion is reflected in the need to protect children and young people from sexual abuse, violence and exploitation \u2013 not least by the fashion industry \u2013 in a society where we still manage to sound surprised about such unattractive developments despite the mindless glorification of violence and the sexualisation of anything that moves. I suppose it's inevitable in times like our own where the traditional moral authority of church and chapel, synagogue and mosque, often arbitrary, capricious and deeply hypocritical, has been widely rejected. People regard themselves as their own moral arbiter \u2013 we are all popes now \u2013 and often make a better job of it than the professionals. Just think of those assorted child abuse scandals which thrived within church institutions until very recently. The C of E apologised for one bad, sad case only last week. Individuals guided by their own conscience are often right, but often confused too. We want little girls not to worry about getting \"fat\" or not having \"cool clothes\" at six and we want little boys to be sensitive to unkindness, bullying and violence. But when it comes to protecting them from the flood of unsuitable material on the internet \u2013 just glimpse those mindlessly violent video games, sheer porn \u2013 many people shrug and mutter about freedom of expression. We reap what we sow. But what about the weekend outburst against David Cameron's imminent consultation on the introduction of same-sex marriage (as distinct from civil partnership) in England and Wales? Since the Scots are having their own devolved debate \u2013 the SNP government is in favour of equality of matrimonial status \u2013 Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Scottish primate and Britain's most senior Catholic, has let rip in the Sunday Telegraph. Basically what he's saying, not for the first time, is that marriage is a universally accepted concept, defined by Article 16 of the universal declaration of human rights (UDHR). It exists free of the passing whims of governments to entrench the relationship between men and women for mutual support and \u2013 jolly important, this bit \u2013 the procreation of children. O'Brien used to be a relative liberal on gay issues, accused of being soft on the existence of gay priests which he acknowledged, but he's toughened up (worldly ambition perhaps?) and opposed civil partnerships before he got the top job. \"I don't agree with that [civil partnership] but I accept it,\" he said on Monday morning during another distinctly underwhelming performance on Radio 4's Today. So he's making what the gay lobby would call progress though he certainly wouldn't call it that. In reply the cardinal would say \u2013 did say in the Sunday Tel \u2013 that the other side wouldn't settle for the legal and civil rights they were being granted then, but would be back for more. With the coalition's help it is now \"seeking to redefine marriage for the whole of society at the behest of a small minority of activists\" via proposals that destroy an ancient and fundamental building block of society and replace it by a new \"state-imposed orthodoxy\". Madness, grotesque and staggeringly arrogant are a few of the labels he attaches to the idea. O'Brien's not alone, of course. In far more temperate language Dr Rowan Williams, archbishop of Canterbury, condemned Cameron's proposal. So did his less gifted but more effective predecessor, Dr George (now Lord) Carey, and the more charismatic Dr John Sentamu, currently at York but probably stalking Williams for the next vacancy at Canterbury. That's politics for you. Being a more formidable intellectual than he is a church leader (Anglicanism is currently on the edge of a serious split over mutual intolerance between factions over gender and sexuality), Williams made a far more subtle job of making his case at the World Council of Churches in Geneva last week than Cardinal O'Brien could make if we left him at the Radio 4 microphone for a month, with John Humphrys gagged and locked in a cupboard. Here's the official summary and text which is worth a quiet look. Williams too is talking about the UDHR as embodying the basic non-negotiable human right to dignity, freedom and much else. He warns against religious leaders so anxious to protect their own beleaguered freedom to make ethical pronouncements that they deny the universality of human rights. Is he talking about homophobic fellow bishops, I wonder? Or even about Cardinal O'Brien? But he also warns against \"the law being used proactively to change culture\", as distinct from being changed over the past century or so to remove discrimination against the full enjoyment of civil society and its entitlements by women \u2013 usually a majority in terms of sheer numbers \u2013 and more recently ethnic and sexual minorities, as well as the variably disabled. Here's what I take to be the crucial passage. \"Now laws change as societies become more conscious of what they are and claim to be; as I have said, it may take time for a society to realise that its practice is inconsistent \u2013 with respect to women and to ethnic, religious or sexual minorities. Law may indeed turn out to be ahead of majority opinion in recognising this, but it has a clear argument to advance \u2013 that the failure to guarantee protection and access is simply incompatible with the very idea of a lawful society. \"But this falls short of a legal charter to promote change in institutions, even in language. Law must prohibit publicly abusive and demeaning language, it must secure institutions that do not systematically disadvantage any category of the community. But these tasks remain 'negative' in force. If it is said, for example, that a failure to legalise assisted suicide \u2013 or indeed same-sex marriage \u2013 perpetuates stigma or marginalisation for some people, the reply must be, I believe, that issues like stigma and marginalisation have to be addressed at the level of culture rather than law, the gradual evolving of fresh attitudes in a spirit of what has been called 'strategic patience' by some legal thinkers.\" It's not quite the language that the Daily Mail uses, but I think what the archbish' is trying to say here is that campaigning to use the law to redraw the traditional man/woman model for marriage so soon after the introduction of civil partnership \u2013 itself a very radical concept only a few years ago \u2013 might be unwise. He uses another culture war issue, the \"right to die\" campaign to make his point. If the law is changed to allow doctors to engage in assisted dying as a legally permitted default position (they do it anyway, but they take risks) then the rights of some people are expanded at the expense of others, those who are old and vulnerable. There are \"some really tough arguments\" here, Williams concedes. Indeed there are, as there are in the eternal struggle over the balance of interest in abortion. I lean towards liberal abortion laws, knowing they are abused, and towards assisted dying, knowing that it will be abused. But I acknowledge the moral dilemma and reject absolutist positions of the kind that a certain type of religious authoritarian \u2013 I name no names, cardinal \u2013 would impose if they were in a position to do so. But just as the tyranny of majority opinions over minority rights \u2013 majoritarianism \u2013 is usually wrong, surely so is its converse, the assertion of minority rights beyond equality before the law (civil partnership provides that) to a wider cultural equality than the law or human rights can actually enforce, any more than it can to the right to employment. I have been impressed by the importance which so many gay people have attached to civil partnership, in contrast to the disdain for marriage among plenty of heterosexuals. Married people are happier than the single or divorced, suggested yet another survey last month, hotly contested as always. Yes, some polls report that voters are now willing to accept full-blooded gay marriage, but indifference is not necessarily the same as tolerance. So instinct tells me that, whatever they have done in Argentina, Iceland or Portugal, it will be wise to retain a legal distinction between marriage and civil partnership.

      "body": "<p>We sometimes congratulate ourselves on avoiding the excesses of America's culture wars where differences over religious faith, sexuality or even the right to own and carry guns routinely lead to people being murdered, ostensibly to protect the sanctity of human life or an 18th-century construction on the US constitution. But how well are we doing closer to home?</p> <p>Marriage has been back in the firing line this weekend, not that it's ever out of the trenches for very long. The Office for National Statistics reported last week that there were 8,657 more of them last year \u2013 241,100 \u2013 than in 2010, proof that a resurgence (so the Daily Mail concluded) of marriage is under way and could be strengthened if you-know-who had the bottle to defy his Lib Dem partners (it's only a coalition, they're not <em>married</em>) and give married couples a token tax break.</p> <p>Cue predictable anger about unmarried couples and singletons being marginalised (France has just dropped \"mademoiselle\" from official papers), along with all the other designated marginalised groups in society we all have to worry about. As the Lib Dem equalities minister, Lynne Featherstone, explained in a typically bouncy interview with the Times, married people are already admired enough (she's a divorcee), so \"why give it a bonus?\"</p> <p>It's all part of an ever-changing debate about family and the individual in society, the role and nature of the state (Swedes apparently see their social contract as being the state and the <em>individual</em>, not the family) and competing visions of morality in a country whose cities are culturally diverse but who countless towns and villages are much less so.</p> <p>Another symptom of wider confusion is reflected in the need to protect children and young people from sexual abuse, violence and exploitation \u2013 not least by the fashion industry \u2013 in a society where we still manage to sound surprised about such unattractive developments despite the mindless glorification of violence and the sexualisation of anything that moves.</p> <p>I suppose it's inevitable in times like our own where the traditional moral authority of church and chapel, synagogue and mosque, often arbitrary, capricious and deeply hypocritical, has been widely rejected. People regard themselves as their own moral arbiter \u2013 we are all popes now \u2013 and often make a better job of it than the professionals. Just think of those assorted child abuse scandals which thrived within church institutions until very recently. The C of E apologised for one bad, sad case only last week.</p> <p>Individuals guided by their own conscience are often right, but often confused too. We want little girls not to worry about getting \"fat\" or not having \"cool clothes\" at six and we want little boys to be sensitive to unkindness, bullying and violence. But when it comes to protecting them from the flood of unsuitable material on the internet \u2013 just glimpse those mindlessly violent video games, sheer porn \u2013 many people shrug and mutter about freedom of expression. We reap what we sow.</p> <p>But what about the weekend outburst against David Cameron's imminent consultation on the introduction of same-sex marriage (as distinct from civil partnership) in England and Wales? Since the Scots are having their own devolved debate \u2013 the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Scotland\" title=\"\">SNP government is in favour</a> of equality of matrimonial status \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Michael_Patrick_O%E2%80%99Brien\" title=\"\">Cardinal Keith O'Brien</a>, Scottish primate and Britain's most senior Catholic, has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/9121424/We-cannot-afford-to-indulge-this-madness.html\" title=\"\">let rip in the Sunday Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>Basically what he's saying, not for the first time, is that marriage is a universally accepted concept, defined by Article 16 of the universal declaration of human rights (UDHR). It exists free of the passing whims of governments to entrench the relationship between men and women for mutual support and \u2013 jolly important, this bit \u2013 the procreation of children. O'Brien used to be a relative liberal on gay issues, accused of being soft on the existence of gay priests which he acknowledged, but he's toughened up (worldly ambition perhaps?) and opposed civil partnerships before he got the top job.</p> <p>\"I don't agree with that [civil partnership] but I accept it,\" he said on Monday morning during another distinctly underwhelming performance on Radio 4's Today. So he's making what the gay lobby would call progress though he certainly wouldn't call it that. In reply the cardinal would say \u2013 did say in the Sunday Tel \u2013 that the other side wouldn't settle for the legal and civil rights they were being granted then, but would be back for more.</p> <p>With the coalition's help it is now \"seeking to redefine marriage for the whole of society at the behest of a small minority of activists\" via proposals that destroy an ancient and fundamental building block of society and replace it by a new \"state-imposed orthodoxy\". Madness, grotesque and staggeringly arrogant are a few of the labels he attaches to the idea.</p> <p>O'Brien's not alone, of course. In far more temperate language <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Williams\" title=\"\">Dr Rowan Williams</a>, archbishop of Canterbury, condemned Cameron's proposal. So did his less gifted but more effective predecessor,<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carey\" title=\"\"> Dr George (now Lord) Carey</a>, and the more charismatic<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sentamu\" title=\"\"> Dr John Sentamu</a>, currently at York but probably stalking Williams for the next vacancy at Canterbury. That's politics for you.</p> <p>Being a more formidable intellectual than he is a church leader (Anglicanism is currently on the edge of a serious split over mutual intolerance between factions over gender and sexuality), Williams made a far more subtle job of making his case at the World Council of Churches in Geneva last week than Cardinal O'Brien could make if we left him at the Radio 4 microphone for a month, with John Humphrys gagged and locked in a cupboard.</p> <p>Here's the <a href=\"http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/2370/human-rights-and-religious-faith\" title=\"\">official summary and text</a> which is worth a quiet look. Williams too is talking about the UDHR as embodying the basic non-negotiable human right to dignity, freedom and much else. He warns against religious leaders so anxious to protect their own beleaguered freedom to make ethical pronouncements that they deny the universality of human rights. Is he talking about homophobic fellow bishops, I wonder? Or even about Cardinal O'Brien?</p> <p>But he also warns against \"the law being used proactively to change culture\", as distinct from being changed over the past century or so to remove discrimination against the full enjoyment of civil society and its entitlements by women \u2013 usually a majority in terms of sheer numbers \u2013 and more recently ethnic and sexual minorities, as well as the variably disabled.</p> <p>Here's what I take to be the crucial passage.</p> <p>\"Now laws change as societies become more conscious of what they are and claim to be; as I have said, it may take time for a society to realise that its practice is inconsistent \u2013 with respect to women and to ethnic, religious or sexual minorities. Law may indeed turn out to be ahead of majority opinion in recognising this, but it has a clear argument to advance \u2013 that the failure to guarantee protection and access is simply incompatible with the very idea of a lawful society.</p> <p>\"But this falls short of a legal charter to promote change in institutions, even in language. Law must prohibit publicly abusive and demeaning language, it must secure institutions that do not systematically disadvantage any category of the community. But these tasks remain 'negative' in force. If it is said, for example, that a failure to legalise assisted suicide \u2013 or indeed same-sex marriage \u2013 perpetuates stigma or marginalisation for some people, the reply must be, I believe, that issues like stigma and marginalisation have to be addressed at the level of culture rather than law, the gradual evolving of fresh attitudes in a spirit of what has been called 'strategic patience' by some legal thinkers.\"</p> <p>It's not quite the language that the Daily Mail uses, but I think what the archbish' is trying to say here is that campaigning to use the law to redraw the traditional man/woman model for marriage so soon after the introduction of civil partnership \u2013 itself a very radical concept only a few years ago \u2013 might be unwise.</p> <p>He uses another culture war issue, the \"right to die\" campaign to make his point. If the law is changed to allow doctors to engage in assisted dying as a legally permitted default position (they do it anyway, but they take risks) then the rights of some people are expanded at the expense of others, those who are old and vulnerable. There are \"some really tough arguments\" here, Williams concedes.</p> <p>Indeed there are, as there are in the eternal struggle over the balance of interest in abortion. I lean towards liberal abortion laws, knowing they are abused, and towards assisted dying, knowing that it will be abused. But I acknowledge the moral dilemma and reject absolutist positions of the kind that a certain type of religious authoritarian \u2013 I name no names, cardinal \u2013 would impose if they were in a position to do so.</p> <p>But just as the tyranny of majority opinions over minority rights \u2013 majoritarianism \u2013 is usually wrong, surely so is its converse, the assertion of minority rights beyond equality before the law (civil partnership provides that) to a wider cultural equality than the law or human rights can actually enforce, any more than it can to the right to employment.</p> <p>I have been impressed by the importance which so many gay people have attached to civil partnership, in contrast to the disdain for marriage among plenty of heterosexuals. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness_economics\" title=\"\">Married people are happier </a> than the single or divorced, suggested yet another survey last month, hotly contested as always.</p> <p>Yes, some polls report that voters are now willing to accept full-blooded gay marriage, but indifference is not necessarily the same as tolerance.

So I thought about the elements I try to balance in my own life: countryside and city life, day and evening. This collection is about clothes that help you find that balance.\" Two weeks after a cameo appearance at London fashion week, McCartney was back in her usual slot on the Paris schedule to present her main collection for autumn 2012. This time she had brought some of her home comforts with her, in a collection that drew fabrics from an English country house wardrobe, but had cut them into the sports-influenced silhouette of modern city dressing. So a sensible tweed coat in soft, heathery tones was updated with a blue-and-white ribbed collar of the type found on baseball jackets, and felted Aran stitch sweater dresses and skirt suits were moulded into an exaggerated hourglass shape at the hips, a wintry addition to a line of succession that leads back to McCartney's ever-popular hourglass-shaped cocktail dresses. The singer Alicia Keys became the latest celebrity to showcase what has become a signature look for McCartney, wearing a trompe l'oeil hourglass dress in the front row at the show. Click here for Stella McCartney's Paris show \u2013 in pictures \"The language of sport is always part of my look,\" said McCartney, rolling her eyes at suggestions of a direct link with this summer's Olympics. But the sports influence, always present in a Stella McCartney show, was noticeably more front-and-centre than in recent seasons. Turtleneck sweaters had wetsuit-style panels around the torso and heavy-duty plastic zippers to the nape of the neck, while all the models \u2013 and the designer herself \u2013 wore their hair in gymnasts' buns. The Italian designer Stefano Pilati is preparing his final show for the house of Yves Saint Laurent. Pilati's decade at the helm was for the most part met with positive, but rarely rapturous, reviews. Commercial successes such as the Tribute sandal, which became a worldwide hit, were not enough to shield him from an increasing volume of rumour surrounding his tenure. Last week YSL issued a statement confirming that Pilati would be leaving the house immediately after this show. Interest in Pilati's departure has been heightened by unconfirmed reports that the cult menswear designer Hedi Slimane is waiting in the wings to replace him. Slimane, who has been without a design role since leaving Dior Homme five years ago, succeeded Yves Saint Laurent as menswear designer for the house when the founder retired, before moving to Dior, where his ultra-slim tailoring had a dramatic effect on menswear from the catwalk to high street. Slimane has never designed womenswear, but his tailoring attracted a devoted following among female fans who snapped up small sizes of his Dior Homme suits. A menswear designer would be an unusual appointment to such a high-profile position in women's fashion, but the Yves Saint Laurent brand has a long tradition of using menswear as inspiration for womenswear in its chic, androgyny-orientated tailoring.",

So I thought about the elements I try to balance in my own life: countryside and city life, day and evening. This collection is about clothes that help you find that balance.\"</p> <p>Two weeks after a cameo appearance at London fashion week, McCartney was back in her usual slot on the Paris schedule to present her main collection for autumn 2012. This time she had brought some of her home comforts with her, in a collection that drew fabrics from an English country house wardrobe, but had cut them into the sports-influenced silhouette of modern city dressing.</p> <p>So a sensible tweed coat in soft, heathery tones was updated with a blue-and-white ribbed collar of the type found on baseball jackets, and felted Aran stitch sweater dresses and skirt suits were moulded into an exaggerated hourglass shape at the hips, a wintry addition to a line of succession that leads back to McCartney's ever-popular hourglass-shaped cocktail dresses. The singer Alicia Keys became the latest celebrity to showcase what has become a signature look for McCartney, wearing a trompe l'oeil hourglass dress in the front row at the show.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2012/mar/05/stalla-mccartney-paris-fashion-week-2012\" title=\"\">Click here for Stella McCartney's Paris show \u2013 in pictures</a></h2> <p>\"The language of sport is always part of my look,\" said McCartney, rolling her eyes at suggestions of a direct link with this summer's Olympics. But the sports influence, always present in a Stella McCartney show, was noticeably more front-and-centre than in recent seasons. Turtleneck sweaters had wetsuit-style panels around the torso and heavy-duty plastic zippers to the nape of the neck, while all the models \u2013 and the designer herself \u2013 wore their hair in gymnasts' buns.</p> <p>The Italian designer Stefano Pilati is preparing his final show for the house of Yves Saint Laurent. Pilati's decade at the helm was for the most part met with positive, but rarely rapturous, reviews. Commercial successes such as the Tribute sandal, which became a worldwide hit, were not enough to shield him from an increasing volume of rumour surrounding his tenure. Last week YSL issued a statement confirming that Pilati would be leaving the house immediately after this show.</p> <p>Interest in Pilati's departure has been heightened by unconfirmed reports that the cult menswear designer Hedi Slimane is waiting in the wings to replace him. Slimane, who has been without a design role since leaving Dior Homme five years ago, succeeded Yves Saint Laurent as menswear designer for the house when the founder retired, before moving to Dior, where his ultra-slim tailoring had a dramatic effect on menswear from the catwalk to high street.</p> <p>Slimane has never designed womenswear, but his tailoring attracted a devoted following among female fans who snapped up small sizes of his Dior Homme suits. A menswear designer would be an unusual appointment to such a high-profile position in women's fashion, but the Yves Saint Laurent brand has a long tradition of using menswear as inspiration for womenswear in its chic, androgyny-orientated tailoring.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Richard Carpenter, who has died of a blood clot aged 82, brought intelligent, imaginative entertainment to generations of young television viewers through the fantasy series he created. After almost two decades as an actor, he found his first success as a writer with Catweazle (1970-71), starring Geoffrey Bayldon as a dishevelled, eccentric, 11th-century magician transported to the 20th century. Comic misunderstandings were mixed with slapstick as Catweazle befriended a farmer's son, Carrot (played by Robin Davies), who unravelled for him modern-day mysteries such as \"electrickery\" and the \"telling-bone\". In the second series, Carpenter had Catweazle searching for symbols of the 13 signs of the Magic Zodiac and being taken in by another boy, Cedric (Gary Warren), at his parents' country estate. \"I've always been interested in the person who is outside society,\" said Carpenter in a 1990 interview with the magazine Time Screen. \"In a sense, that is the hero \u2013 the heroic figure is the man who takes on the world alone.\" Although Catweazle won the 1971 Writers' Guild award for best children's drama script, the new management at LWT did not commission a further series. However, Carpenter was made the lead writer on another of the company's Sunday-teatime series, The Adventures of Black Beauty (1972-74), which took its characters from Anna Sewell's book but owed more to the success of the contemporary ITV equestrian drama Follyfoot. Like Catweazle, it became required family viewing beyond the immediate target audience of children. Later, Carpenter re-imagined the Robin Hood legend in Robin of Sherwood (1984-86). Mysticism was one of its distinctive ingredients, reflecting a renewed interest in paganism, as well as the concerns of the growing environmental movement and \u2013 through the idealism of the hero \u2013 a backlash against the materialism of the Thatcher era. Another decade on, Carpenter adapted The Borrowers (in 1992) and The Return of The Borrowers (in 1993) for the BBC, from Mary Norton's novels about the 6in-high Clock family, forced to face the world outside after fleeing from their home under the floorboards of an English manor house. The scripts, special effects and award-winning production design created a disarmingly believable secret world. Carpenter was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and showed an interest in Greek mythology and Shakespeare as a child. After studying history of art at an art school in Cambridge, he did national service in the army, where he earned the nickname \"Kip\". He won a scholarship to the Old Vic theatre school, London, and worked with repertory companies across the country; he met the actor Annabelle Lee in Sheffield and they married in 1954. His first screen appearances were in children's television serials \u2013 The Silver Sword (1957), The Lost King (1958) and The Black Arrow (1958), the latter based on Robert Louis Stevenson's novel about the War of the Roses, with Carpenter playing the abbot. He was soon acting in peak-time series, taking the roles of the writer turned private eye's assistant Peter Parker in the crime drama Knight Errant (1959-60) and Dr Philip Hope in The Citadel (1960-61). There were also dozens of one-off character roles on television and in films such as HMS Defiant (1962). In 1969, after a year in the West End play Wait Until Dark, Carpenter decided he was tired of acting and submitted his first script idea, Catweazle, to LWT. Its success meant he could leave his previous career behind for good. He was given the chance to create another original series with The Ghosts of Motley Hall (1976-78), about phantoms living in an ancestral home. The idea came from his recollection of seeing a ghost while staying at theatrical digs in Liverpool and the characters conformed to Carpenter's formula of writing about loners \u2013 in this case, those \"out of the mainstream existence\", as he described it. While making The Adventures of Black Beauty, Carpenter formed a friendship with its producer, Sidney Cole, and executive producer, Paul Knight. The three established their own production company, Gatetarn, and made drama series about English folk legends. Dick Turpin (1979-82), starring Richard O'Sullivan as the highway robber, was followed by Smuggler (1981), with Oliver Tobias playing an unjustly disgraced 19th-century naval lieutenant, and its sequel, Adventurer (1987). The trio found their greatest success with Robin of Sherwood, starring Michael Praed and then Jason Connery. Carpenter also contributed scripts to Enid Blyton's Famous Five (1978-79), the animated series Doctor Snuggles (1981), The Baker Street Boys (1983), Pulaski (1987), Hannay (1989) and The Scarlet Pimpernel (1999). On completing The Borrowers, which won a Bafta for best children's programme, he told the magazine TV Zone: \"I'd rather write adult programmes for children than childish programmes for adults.\" Carpenter received a second Writers' Guild award, for Out of Sight (1996-98), a children's comedy he created about an invisible schoolboy. His final script for television, I Was a Rat (2001), was a three-part adventure based on Philip Pullman's fantasy novel. Carpenter, who wrote novelisations of many of his television programmes, also received a Children's Bafta award in 2000. He is survived by Annabelle and their children, Tom and Harriet. \u2022 Richard Michael Carpenter, writer, producer and actor, born 14 August 1929; died 26 February 2012",

      "bodyText": "The biggest animation opening weekend in the history of Universal Pictures owes much to Chris Meledandri, head of the studio-owned Illumination Entertainment. Illumination is shaping up to be every bit as devastating a box-office force as Blue Sky, the company that launched the Ice Age franchise which Meledandri oversaw during his time as president of 20th Century Fox Animation. Meledandri is a whizz at what he does, and previously delivered the superb Despicable Me (the sequel is due in 2013) for Universal, so it's little surprise that The Lorax was able to dominate the US box office charts at the weekend, even if the scale of victory stunned everybody. The $71m (\u00a344.8m) debut was roughly $50m ahead of Warner Bros' comedy Project X in second place. This was also the biggest debut of the year so far and keeps up the dynamic pace set in January and February. This is the type of news cinema owners are desperate for, and they will eat it up with even more relish, given that they're a beleaguered lot these days. New technology has enabled a host of cutting-edge distribution methods to flourish and the argument goes that before long we will all eschew the local multiplex or arthouse in favour of curling up on the sofa with an iPad or congregating in front of a TV to stream new releases. The exhibition community \u2013 namely the theatre chains and smaller independent venues \u2013 clings to triumphs such as The Lorax and will get a lot of play out of its performance at next month's CinemaCon event in Las Vegas. This annual gathering with studio heads serves as a timely reminder that there's no better place to launch films such as this \u2013 as well as other tentpole movies such as the imminent The Hunger Games and of course the summer blockbusters-elect. I think they're right. The worldwide growth of Imax and the occasional spectacular success of 3D bolsters the case, even if the distribution landscape is shifting and film-makers find themselves with an increasing array of distribution methods. The cinema has on the whole been kind to Oscar winners large and small, so it is interesting to note that The Artist has not (yet) been a major beneficiary of the so-called Oscar bounce. Michel Hazanavicius' charmer won five prizes at the Academy Awards including best picture, director and lead actor. Despite this it only climbed 37% against last weekend's box office after Harvey Weinstein expanded it by 790 theatres to 1,756. It should have done a lot better, and $3.9m in returns means a so-so $37.1m after 15 weekends. Still, it takes some doing to get bums on seats for a silent black-and-white movie and the sense is that The Artist may stick around for several weekends as word of mouth continues to grow. By contrast, Sony Pictures Classics increased the screen count for Asghar Farhadi's Iranian best foreign language Oscar winner A Separation from 83 to 243 and watched box office climb 174% on the previous week.

      "bodyText": "The Sun on Sunday is thought to have lost more than 500,000 for its second outing at the weekend, a fall of about 17% week on week according to very early unofficial industry estimates. News International's second Sunday edition of the Sun, which sold about 3.22m copies when it launched on 26 February, is thought to have sold just more than 2.6m at the weekend, according to early figures from wholesalers and retailers. These early estimates, which are subject to change as the full-weekend sales figures are consolidated in the coming days, represent a fall of between 17% and 19%, or 550,000-600,000 copies week on week. The Sun on Sunday, which is being offered at a cut price 50p, is selling at almost exactly the same level as News of the World which was closed last summer with its circulation at 2.66m. On Saturday Rupert Murdoch tweeted that a fall of the order of about 15% would be a \"great result\". \"What will second Sunday edition of Sun sell? My guess down fifteen per cent would be a great result,\" he tweeted at his official @rupertmurdoch account. Early estimates put sales of the Sunday Mirror, which reverted back to its full price of \u00a31 across most of the UK on the weekend, down about 6% week on week. The Sunday Mirror fell about 30% when the Sunday edition of the Sun launched on 26 February. If the early estimates prove to be a close approximation of the final official figures for the weekend, the Sunday Mirror sold about 1.15m copies at the weekend. Its sales are now just marginally ahead of the 1.09m the Sunday Mirror was selling before the closure of News of the World last July. Trinity Mirror stablemate the People, the biggest faller among the Sun Sunday's tabloid rivals on 26 February with about 35% of sales disappearing, is estimated to have fallen about a further 10% this weekend. The People is estimated to have sold about 464,000 copies at the weekend, about 10,000 copies fewer than it was selling before the closure of NoW. The People also reverted to its full price of \u00a31 nationally on the weekend, except in the north and Tay regions of Scotland. Richard Desmond's Daily Star Sunday, which suffered a 22% fall in sales following the launch of the Sun Sunday, is thought to have either maintained or even slightly increased sales at the weekend. Daily Star Sunday is estimated to have sold just over 500,000 copies. The paper was selling 306,000 before the closure of the NoW. Daily Star Sunday maintained its national 50% price cut to 50p to challenge Murdoch's new tabloid. Stablemate the Sunday Express is estimated to be down slightly, by maybe a couple of percentage points week on week. The Sunday Express, which has not cut its \u00a31.20 price, fell 11% in the first week that the Sun published a Sunday edition. The Sunday Express is thought to have sold about 507,000 copies. It was selling 538,000 before the closure of News of the World. The Mail on Sunday, which bucked the trend to grow sales last week by a slim 0.3% to about 1.9m, is thought to have slipped back by about 3% week on week. The MoS elected to maintain its \u00a31.50 cover price despite the entry of the Sun on Sunday. The MoS is thought to have sold about 1.84m copies, according to early estimates. It has roughly maintained its pre-NoW sales level. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "What do you get if you cross Silvio Berlusconi with Vladimir Putin? It sounds like a joke, but it's actually the premise of a Moscow theatre's latest production, which offers a rare, satirical sideswipe at the newly re-elected Russian president. BerlusPutin, which is based on Dario Fo's play L'Anomalo Bicefalo (The Two-Headed Anomaly), imagines the outcome of half of the former Italian prime minister's brain being transplanted into Putin's head, following the former's death from a heart attack. The play shows Putin, who claimed victory in this weekend's Russian presidential elections, bare-chested and fondling the bottom of Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, with whom he is rumoured to have had an affair. Elsewhere, Putin is seen overdosing on Botox and, finally, morphing into Dobby the house elf from JK Rowling's Harry Potter novels. Since opening at the Teatr.doc in Moscow last month, performances of BerlusPutin have sold out until April. Opposition to Putin is at its strongest in the Russian capital, with reports claiming that only 47% of the city's vote went his way this weekend, compared to 64% overall. \"We're not drawing his psychological profile,\" Serguei Epishev, the actor playing Putin, told France 24. \"Our play is telling a story based on his public declarations, news and rumours.\" Director Varvara Faer echoed that, adding, \"The main idea was to show our political position after 20 years of silence and passivity. People who come here are generally fed up with the way the government has been humiliating them.\" The production also incorporates accusations of corruption amongst Putin's team, which have only increased since this weekend's elections. Fo's original, which sees Putin's brain transplanted into Berlusconi's head, was itself the subject of controversy following its 2003 premiere in Italy. The playwright was sued for defamation to the tune of \u20ac1m by a member of Berlusconi's party, Marcello Dell'Utri.",

      "bodyText": "They came in the middle of the night. The village of Darya Khan, where electricity is rare and winter nights are very cold, was silent when the two police vans arrived. \"We were sleeping. They smashed in the door and went straight for my son,\" said Muhammad Azim, 65. \"They beat me and my wife and then they left. They took the boy. We have heard nothing since from anyone.\" The \"boy\" was 21-year-old Obaidullah, a student of Islamic studies at a religious school in the city of Faisalabad in central Pakistan. He was at home in his village in the south of Punjab province because he had just got married. Obaidullah's father, an illiterate labourer, said he has no idea why his son was taken. \"He was just a simple student. We are poor people, too poor to be involved in politics or anything like that,\" he said. The raid took place last month. No charges have been framed and no information about the case is available but, though security officials said they were unaware of the individual case, it is certain that the authorities suspected Obaidullah was involved with Islamic extremist groups. Campaigners call such operations \"abductions\" and estimate that thousands of \"disappeared\" are currently being held without trial. The campaigners say they have positively identified 700 detainees. Nothing, however, has been heard of Obaidullah since the raid seven weeks ago. Pakistan's security services, both military and civilian, say the detentions are a necessary evil. \"We are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week to keep the country safe,\" one intelligence official told the Guardian. \"We have no choice.\" Pakistan has suffered hundreds of attacks by Islamic militants in recent years which have killed at least 10,000 civilians, and 7,000 policemen and soldiers. For many years the detention facilities were run without fear of scrutiny, be it from families, from politicians or from the courts. This, however, may be changing, offering some slim hope to families that they will see their loved ones again. This year, the main military intelligence service, the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was forced by the supreme court to produce seven men at a hearing in Islamabad, the capital. The detainees were part of an 11-strong group first held on charges of involvement in a string of suicide bombings against military targets between November 2007 and January 2008. Though acquitted by a civilian court in 2010 they were immediately detained again by the ISI. Four of the men died of \"natural causes\" while in the agency's custody, a senior security official said. \"Yes, they were not fed five-course dinners. Yes, they were not staying in the Marriott. But there was no deliberate attempt to starve them to death or poison them or anything like that,\" he said. \"We had no reason to torture them. They had already accepted all that they had done.\" The men, recently handed over to civilian authorities, were brought before the judges in an appalling physical state. Their lawyer told the court they had not seen sunlight for months. Emaciated, disorientated, some unable to stand, they had an emotional reunion with family members. \"They picked me up from my shop. No one has ever explained to us why we are being held,\" Abdul Majid, 23, shouted to reporters as he was led away after the hearing. \"Either take our life or let us go.\" Despite the men's terrible condition, the case has encouraged other families. \"We are expecting a lot from the supreme court because it is the only institution which is listening to us,\" said Noor Hassan, a 45-year-old hawker whose son Sajadul, 22, was picked up last July on his way home from the religious school where he was studying. \"A pickup truck with police in it took him away. Witnesses told us. No official has admitted it but we are certain,\" Hassan said. The earliest secret detentions identified by campaigners date back to the early 1990s. But cases began to increase in late 2001 as Pakistani authorities moved against some of the militant groups within the country in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Some detainees were handed over to US services or interrogated in their presence. The numbers of abductions rose dramatically between 2006 and 2007, when Pakistan itself became a victim of intense Islamic militant violence. They continued after the country returned to civilian rule in 2008. Activists seeking greater autonomy for the resource-rich south-western province of Balochistan have also been targeted. As militants in the province stepped up the violence, the abductions and associated killings there also rose.. After years of denial, Pakistani security agencies now admit that they detain large numbers of people, but they claim they hold only individuals whom security services are \"100% sure\" are involved in extremist violence. \"Yes we are picking people up. We would prefer not to have to but it is very difficult when there are problems with getting evidence, witnesses don't want to testify, and judges and policemen are intimidated,\" one senior Pakistani security official said. \"Either we keep them or they are freed to go back to what they were doing. We hear about their rights but what about the rights of the victims?\" Analysts agree that there are problems within the court system. \"Excesses have happened but it's a very tricky issue,\" said Ejaz Haider, director of the Jinnah Institute thinktank in Islamabad. \"Many terrorists have been let off the hook and that is extremely frustrating for the security agencies. So one begins to understand why there would be these disappearances and extrajudicial killings.\" Dozens of families gathered in the capital last month to protest against the detention of their relatives. Many had travelled from the southern Punjab, strongholds of violent hardline groups such as Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan. Such outfits have been used as proxies by the Pakistani security establishment over recent decades but some members have now turned against their former masters. Other relatives had come from the restive zone close to the Afghan frontier where new legislation allows internment of individuals who are deemed a terrorist threat. Ishfaq Ahmed Kakakhel's cousin, a teacher in the town of Nowshera, about 50 miles from the Afghan frontier, was detained last October. \"We've heard from other detainees who have been released that he has been badly abused, physically and mentally,\" Kakakhel said. Such abuse appears to be systematic. A letter smuggled out from one detainee and obtained by the Guardian describes repeated beatings with fists and metal-tipped staves, being forced to stand or sit for days at a time, having heavy iron weights rolled over legs and arms to crush all the muscles \"to a pulp\" and undergoing a form of water torture. \"Four men took hold of my arms and legs, others beat my wrists and feet and one repeatedly poured water into my mouth and nose,\" the detainee, a military cleric who is still in detention, wrote in the letter smuggled out three years after his arrest in 2004. Though relations have deteriorated significantly over the past 18 months, for many years the ISI worked with US and other western agencies as a partner in the global \"war on terror\" to hunt wanted individuals belonging to al-Qaida or otherwise deemed to be an international threat. However, the detentions have further fuelled existing anti-western feeling in Pakistan. At the recent protests, demonstrators brandished a placard saying: \"Take back your dollars [in aid] and return our loved ones.\" Another read: \"US go home, you are violating our human rights.\" Western intelligence agencies initially only focused their attention on individuals linked to al-Qaida. Over the last decade their interest has broadened. Some families have been told by the authorities that their relatives were not detained but were killed fighting in neighbouring Afghanistan. Thousands of young Pakistani men have crossed the frontier to fight with insurgents against Nato and Afghan government troops there in recent years. Muhammad Yusuf Waseem, a 72-year-old retired bank clerk from Kabirwala in southern Punjab, was told that his 18-year-old son, who disappeared in August 2004, was among those killed fighting alongside the Taliban. \"I don't believe it,\" he said. \"He was just an ordinary kid. He did nothing other than go to the shop and come back home. He had just taken his exams and had no contact with any political or militant group. He is my youngest son and I want to see him again before I die.\" Additional reporting by Naveed Ahmad",

Nothing, however, has been heard of Obaidullah since the raid seven weeks ago.</p> <p>Pakistan's security services, both military and civilian, say the detentions are a necessary evil.</p> <p>\"We are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week to keep the country safe,\" one intelligence official told the Guardian. \"We have no choice.\"</p> <p>Pakistan has suffered hundreds of attacks by Islamic militants in recent years which have killed at least 10,000 civilians, and 7,000 policemen and soldiers.</p> <p>For many years the detention facilities were run without fear of scrutiny, be it from families, from politicians or from the courts. This, however, may be changing, offering some slim hope to families that they will see their loved ones again.</p> <p>This year, the main military intelligence service, the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/13/pakistan-spy-abducted-men-court\" title=\"\">forced by the supreme court to produce seven men</a> at a hearing in Islamabad, the capital.</p> <p>The detainees were part of an 11-strong group first held on charges of involvement in a string of suicide bombings against military targets between November 2007 and January 2008. Though acquitted by a civilian court in 2010 they were immediately detained again by the ISI. Four of the men died of \"natural causes\" while in the agency's custody, a senior security official said.</p> <p>\"Yes, they were not fed five-course dinners. Yes, they were not staying in the Marriott. But there was no deliberate attempt to starve them to death or poison them or anything like that,\" he said. \"We had no reason to torture them. They had already accepted all that they had done.\"</p> <p>The men, recently handed over to civilian authorities, were brought before the judges in an appalling physical state. Their lawyer told the court they had not seen sunlight for months. Emaciated, disorientated, some unable to stand, they had an emotional reunion with family members.</p> <p>\"They picked me up from my shop. No one has ever explained to us why we are being held,\" Abdul Majid, 23, shouted to reporters as he was led away after the hearing. \"Either take our life or let us go.\"</p> <p>Despite the men's terrible condition, the case has encouraged other families.</p> <p>\"We are expecting a lot from the supreme court because it is the only institution which is listening to us,\" said Noor Hassan, a 45-year-old hawker whose son Sajadul, 22, was picked up last July on his way home from the religious school where he was studying. \"A pickup truck with police in it took him away. Witnesses told us. No official has admitted it but we are certain,\" Hassan said.</p> <p>The earliest secret detentions identified by campaigners date back to the early 1990s. But cases began to increase in late 2001 as Pakistani authorities moved against some of the militant groups within the country in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Some detainees were handed over to US services or interrogated in their presence.</p> <p>The numbers of abductions rose dramatically between 2006 and 2007, when Pakistan itself became a victim of intense Islamic militant violence. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/16/alqaida.pakistan\" title=\"\">They continued after the country returned to civilian rule</a> in 2008.</p> <p>Activists seeking greater autonomy for the resource-rich south-western province of Balochistan have also been targeted. As militants in the province stepped up the violence, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/07/28/pakistan-security-forces-disappear-opponents-balochistan\" title=\"\">the abductions and associated killings there also rose.</a>.</p> <p>After years of denial, Pakistani security agencies now admit that they detain large numbers of people, but they claim they hold only individuals whom security services are \"100% sure\" are involved in extremist violence.</p> <p>\"Yes we are picking people up. We would prefer not to have to but it is very difficult when there are problems with getting evidence, witnesses don't want to testify, and judges and policemen are intimidated,\" one senior Pakistani security official said. \"Either we keep them or they are freed to go back to what they were doing. We hear about their rights but what about the rights of the victims?\"</p> <p>Analysts agree that there are problems within the court system. \"Excesses have happened but it's a very tricky issue,\" said Ejaz Haider, director of the Jinnah Institute thinktank in Islamabad. \"Many terrorists have been let off the hook and that is extremely frustrating for the security agencies. So one begins to understand why there would be these disappearances and extrajudicial killings.\"</p> <p>Dozens of families gathered in the capital last month to protest against the detention of their relatives. Many had travelled from the southern Punjab, strongholds of violent hardline groups such as Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan.</p> <p>Such outfits have been used as proxies by the Pakistani security establishment over recent decades but some members have now turned against their former masters.</p> <p>Other relatives had come from the restive zone close to the Afghan frontier where new legislation allows internment of individuals who are deemed a terrorist threat.</p> <p>Ishfaq Ahmed Kakakhel's cousin, a teacher in the town of Nowshera, about 50 miles from the Afghan frontier, was detained last October. \"We've heard from other detainees who have been released that he has been badly abused, physically and mentally,\" Kakakhel said.</p> <p>Such abuse appears to be systematic. A letter smuggled out from one detainee and obtained by the Guardian describes repeated beatings with fists and metal-tipped staves, being forced to stand or sit for days at a time, having heavy iron weights rolled over legs and arms to crush all the muscles \"to a pulp\" and undergoing a form of water torture.</p> <p>\"Four men took hold of my arms and legs, others beat my wrists and feet and one repeatedly poured water into my mouth and nose,\" the detainee, a military cleric who is still in detention, wrote in the letter smuggled out three years after his arrest in 2004.</p> <p>Though relations have deteriorated significantly over the past 18 months, for many years the ISI worked with US and other western agencies as a partner in the global \"war on terror\" to hunt wanted individuals belonging to al-Qaida or otherwise deemed to be an international threat.</p> <p>However, the detentions have further fuelled existing anti-western feeling in Pakistan. At the recent protests, demonstrators brandished a placard saying: \"Take back your dollars [in aid] and return our loved ones.\" Another read: \"US go home, you are violating our human rights.\"</p> <p>Western intelligence agencies initially only focused their attention on individuals linked to al-Qaida. Over the last decade their interest has broadened.</p> <p>Some families have been told by the authorities that their relatives were not detained but were killed fighting in neighbouring Afghanistan.</p> <p>Thousands of young Pakistani men have crossed the frontier to fight with insurgents against Nato and Afghan government troops there in recent years.</p> <p>Muhammad Yusuf Waseem, a 72-year-old retired bank clerk from Kabirwala in southern Punjab, was told that his 18-year-old son, who disappeared in August 2004, was among those killed fighting alongside the Taliban.</p> <p>\"I don't believe it,\" he said. \"He was just an ordinary kid. He did nothing other than go to the shop and come back home. He had just taken his exams and had no contact with any political or militant group. He is my youngest son and I want to see him again before I die.\"</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Naveed Ahmad</em></p>",

This is far lower than the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals in the local authority \u2013 23.9% \u2013 and for the postcode area \u2013 28.7%. The school is voluntary aided, which means the majority of governors are appointed by the church. The governing body can set the admissions criteria. In other schools the local authority does this. This means a voluntary aided school can \u2013 and often does \u2013 use faith as a criterion for admission. In its last Ofsted report, in 2010, inspectors noted the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals was below the national average. There were an above-average number of pupils with special needs or disabilities. St James's Roman Catholic primary, Richmond, south-west London St James's has 1% of pupils eligible for free meals, according to government data. In its local authority 9.9% of pupils are eligible for the benefit \u2013 9.7% in the postcode area. Ofsted's last full inspection, in 2008, described the school as outstanding. Inspectors noted the low proportion of pupils who take up free meals. But they said almost a third of pupils were from minority ethnic groups \u2013 higher than average \u2013 and the proportion learning English as an additional language was similar to that found in most schools. Richmond council said the proportion of pupils on free school meals varied because entitlement depended on proof families were receiving particular financial support. \"Sometimes children who are entitled to a free school meal do not claim for one,\" a spokeswoman said. Thorner CofE primary, Leeds At Thorner 8.5% of pupils are eligible for free school meals, according to the DfE data. The proportion of pupils eligible in the local authority is 22.4% and 40.2% in the postcode area. The school is voluntary controlled so, while some governors are appointed by the church, the local authority retains control of admissions policy. When Ofsted last visited, in 2008, inspectors noted that the number of pupils eligible for free meals was \"well below the national average\". Most pupils lived locally. A spokesman for Leeds city council said Thorner was in a \"more affluent area\" where fewer children would be entitled to free meals.",

There were an above-average number of pupils with special needs or disabilities.</p> <p><strong>St James's Roman Catholic primary, Richmond, south-west London</strong></p> <p>St James's has 1% of pupils eligible for free meals, according to government data. In its local authority 9.9% of pupils are eligible for the benefit \u2013 9.7% in the postcode area.</p> <p>Ofsted's last full inspection, in 2008, described the school as outstanding. Inspectors noted the low proportion of pupils who take up free meals. But they said almost a third of pupils were from minority ethnic groups \u2013 higher than average \u2013 and the proportion learning English as an additional language was similar to that found in most schools.</p> <p>Richmond council said the proportion of pupils on free school meals varied because entitlement depended on proof families were receiving particular financial support. \"Sometimes children who are entitled to a free school meal do not claim for one,\" a spokeswoman said.</p> <p><strong>Thorner CofE primary, Leeds</strong></p> <p>At Thorner 8.5% of pupils are eligible for free school meals, according to the DfE data. The proportion of pupils eligible in the local authority is 22.4% and 40.2% in the postcode area.</p> <p>The school is voluntary controlled so, while some governors are appointed by the church, the local authority retains control of admissions policy.</p> <p>When Ofsted last visited, in 2008, inspectors noted that the number of pupils eligible for free meals was \"well below the national average\". Most pupils lived locally.</p> <p>A spokesman for Leeds city council said Thorner was in a \"more affluent area\" where fewer children would be entitled to free meals.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Real Zaragoza's fans watched the scoreboard clock up another minute and walked out the stadium. When it turned to 77, they started whistling. They whistled for a minute, booed a bit too, then made for the exit, raising an arm in defiant disgust as they did so. And who could blame them? Out on the pitch, their team were losing 1-0, could have been losing by two or three, and were on the point of completing a run of only one win in 17. They were bottom of the table for a 12th successive week. Worse, they were losing to Villarreal \u2013 the last of the safe teams, now easing 15 points clear of the home side. Besides, this was becoming contagious. The week before, their team had given up on a game early and their coach had given up on a press conference even earlier: Manolo Jim\u00e9nez walked into the M\u00e1laga media room, apologised for his brevity, accused his squad of playing for barely 30 minutes, insisted, \"I feel ashamed, ashamed!\" then walked out again. He'd been there barely a minute. The fans were even more ashamed and every bit as angry. And they'd held on 76 minutes more than their manager, 77 more than their president, who hadn't turned up to the game at all. Why shouldn't they give up too? Why? This is why: in the 85th minute Luis Garc\u00eda scored an equaliser. And in the 93rd, Abraham made it 2-1. Suddenly, those who had decided that if they go there will be trouble were leaping into the air celebrating. Those who had decided that if they stayed it will be double, were left feeling a little silly. They had missed two goals; they had sat through all that dross all season long and now they had only gone and missed the first win at La Romareda in almost five months. They had got it so very, very wrong. Only they hadn't. Sunday's walkout was about more than Sunday's performance. It was about more even than this season's performance. Or the season before. Or the season before that. It was not about the fact that relegation looms. It was about the fact that if Real Zaragoza are relegated, it would be the third relegation in a decade. One of Spain's historic big clubs, winner of nine titles, ninth in the all-time table, had spent 24 consecutive years in the First Division until 2002. Now, the risk was that they would head to the Second Division for a third time in 10. And if they go down, they may go down. Permanently. More than a risk, relegation looks a certainty \u2013 even if the president did insist: \"We will not be in Segunda next season.\" The team are desperately weak and a long way adrift, nine points from survival despite Sunday's victory. No one has scored fewer goals and only Sporting Gij\u00f3n have conceded more. Yet their best player has been Roberto the goalkeeper \u2013 and even he is not quite as good as many insist. After last week's outburst, Manolo Jim\u00e9nez went quiet, taking time to decide his future. Called into a cafe in the city by the owner, he eventually decided that he was staying. Not because Zaragoza could be saved but because, he said, \"only rats desert sinking ships\". It was time for loyalty and duty. He had planned to stay in Andaluc\u00eda after the M\u00e1laga game \u2013 he is from Seville \u2013 but instead travelled back with the team, determined to stand by them. After all, no one else would. They were, Jim\u00e9nez, later remarked, \"frightened\". When he reappeared, there was no tub-thumping, no rabble-rousing, just grim realism \u2013 and brutal honesty. An unavoidable sadness. Resignation but no resignation. No sacking either. \"Leaving now would be the act of a coward. I am the captain of this ship and I am not going. We need to let women and children off the boat first, then the men, then the crew and last of all the captain,\" Jim\u00e9nez insisted. Nor, he said, would there be any point in Zaragoza bringing in another manager \"who surely wouldn't even want to be there\". \"If we're going to go down, we'll go down,\" he added, \"but let's at least do it with dignity. Let's not drag the shirt through the mud.\" It was, in short, too late. Not just to keep Zaragoza up, but to stop that shirt being dragged through the dirt \u2013 and that is what the fans were complaining about. The choice of the 77th minute for their protest was not coincidence: it was the 32nd minute of the second half, symbolising the year of the club's foundation: 1932. \"The reason I walked out in M\u00e1laga is that if I had stayed there, I would have exploded,\" Jim\u00e9nez explained. And had he done so, he might have lifted the lid on a club in crisis. Since president and majority shareholder Agapito Iglesias took over at Zaragoza five years ago and promised Champions League football, players have come and gone at an astonishing rate. It all started with huge outlays on players like Pablo Aimar, Andr\u00e9s D'Alessandro and Ricardo Oliveira. Now, the squad is largely made up of scraps and players with the right agent. In those five years, Agapito has had seven coaches. And those are the ones that said yes. \"They didn't put a gun to my head to make me sign,\" Jim\u00e9nez said of his recent arrival in place of Javier Aguirre. They did, though, pull the wool over his eyes. M\u00edchel, now at Sevilla, had already said no. They can no longer use the trick they once did: chuck money at the man in charge. They paid Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral \u20ac2.4m (\u00a32m) as a Second Division coach \u2013 more than Bernd Schuster was getting at the time. And Schuster was at Real Madrid. Marcelino won promotion but was ditched, an astonishingly bitter communique on the club's website eschewing the normal \"thanks for the hard work\" to insist that: \"His legacy is the sad title of the worst defence, a place in the relegation zone, just three wins in 14, and a first-round knockout in the Copa del Rey.\" Zaragoza have published a public mission statement. It talks of \"professionalism\", \"gentlemanliness\", \"unity\", \"transparency\" and \"ambition\", of the club being above \"personal interest\". Reading it, you can't help wondering if it is some kind of spoof. Zaragoza owe players more than \u20ac50m in unpaid wages. Victims of relegation and the lack of a parachute payment, victims too of the bitter TV war (choosing the wrong side for their next deal has left the company with which they have their current deal relegating them down their list of payment priorities), they are above all victims of their own disastrous handling of the club. Of Agapito's desire to control everything even when he is out of control. The debt is over \u20ac130m. The club captain was forced out, in tears, because they needed the money. And this summer they went into administration \u2013 an administration with which the league, owed \u20ac1.6m by the club, is refusing to cooperate. Nothing happens without the president's say so but much of the time he doesn't say so. This summer they also turned to a third-party investment fund to help them sign players: Roberto cost \u20ac8.5m; Zaragoza paid just \u20ac85,000 of that. \"We had no choice,\" the club insisted. Little is known of the fund; one thing that is known is that Agapito is among the investors in it. Yes, Agapito the Zaragoza president. The same Zaragoza president who has not been to the ground for almost three months now, who barely dares to show his face in public, but insists that he will not sell his controlling stake. The atmosphere had become, as one player puts it, \"impossible\". Jim\u00e9nez talks of \"fear\", others of malaise. And so the fans are left to protest. They may have missed the goals, but Saturday provided a glimmer of hope in the miracle; what it did not offer was a long-term solution and the protests will continue. At least there was dignity, though. \"We worked so hard at this, it was a total victory,\" Jim\u00e9nez said. \"My shoes are destroyed: the soles are worn through and they're covered in chalk. My suit is ruined. But I don't care. We can't go around trying to be handsome. Besides, that's what dry cleaners are for \u2013 there's a need for employment in Spain, so let them clean it. We played without fear, with effort, with desire. The players are so exhausted they can't even talk; there are stairs going up to the dressing room; they had to haul themselves up them. That is what we must do now.\" Yet there was realism too. \"We are down the bottom because we should be down at the bottom,\" Jim\u00e9nez added. \"This is not a problem that comes from now; it comes from many, many games ago.\" Talking points \u2022 You want golazos? Head to Getafe, where M\u00e1laga were 1-0 down until three goals from a combined distance of close to 100 yards gave them a 3-1 win and briefly put them in the Champions league places. Eliseu, Toulalan, Cazorla. Woof! Woof! And woofity woof! Athletic, though, took that fourth slot off M\u00e1laga with a 2-0 win in the Basque derby the following day. La Real had a perfectly good goal disallowed before Susaeta scored two perfectly, perfectly good goals. \u2022 Speaking of woof: Rayo. 2-0 down, 4-2 winners. Two more for Michu \u2013 La Liga's top-scoring Spaniard. They're eighth now, just three points off the Champions League places. Woof! \u2022 The Simeone Effect is on the wane \u2013 at least in terms of results. The sensations are good, the stats are not. They have now not won in five after a 1-1 draw at Sevilla, who still have the same old problem: no midfield. When teams close off against them, denying them the chance to lengthen the pitch and get in behind them from the wings, they lack creativity. The moment of the night at the Pizju\u00e1n was the karaoke version of the Sevilla hymn. Brilliant. \u2022 Madrid won 5-0. Best moment? Probably Kak\u00e1's lovely skill and silky assist. \u2022 Javier Clemente came and parked the bus. He nearly got a result too. Barcelona struggled for the first and then conceded an equaliser that forced them to seek a second against Sporting Gij\u00f3n. Eventually Seydou Ke\u00efta got it before Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez rounded off the scoring. \"We had them acojonadillo [crapping themselves a bit] for a while,\" grinned Clemente. \"That's not bad.\" What was bad, said the Catalan media, was the refereeing: Barcelona had three penalty shouts turned down (two were, one might not be) and had Gerard Piqu\u00e9 sent off. Barcelona insist that they do not talk about referees but this time Piqu\u00e9 was doing just that \u2013 and his choice of words might get him in trouble. \"Sometimes you think they take it as a personal issue,\" said Piqu\u00e9 afterwards. \"I had spoken to him about a penalty before which I thought was clear and you wonder if they take down your number and store it up for later. It is like it is half premeditated.\" Premeditated? Ouch. Spain's head of referees, silent until now, will ask the RFEF to ban Piqu\u00e9. Results: Getafe 1-3 M\u00e1laga, Mallorca 1-1 Osasuna, Rayo 4-2 Racing, Barcelona 3-1 Sporting, Sevilla 1-1 Atl\u00e9tico, Zaragoza 2-1 Villarreal, Athletic 2-0 Real Sociedad, Granada 0-1 Valencia, Madrid 5-0 Espanyol.

The trust had expected to receive the money from the Department of Health following the announcement in February that it was putting aside additional funding of about \u00a31.5bn to support the PFI costs of trusts in England that were struggling with their repayments. Peterborough and Stamford was named as one of the trusts, but has not received the funding for 2011-12. To cover its costs in the interim, the trust has sought up to \u00a346m of temporary public dividend capital funding from the health department. The trust, which has an income of around \u00a3220m a year, has now added the \u00a322m sum it expected to its projected deficit for 2011-12. \"Although the underlying operational performance of the trust remains as it was described in the previous public board meeting, the retained deficit has increased from \u00a334.3m to \u00a356.3m,\" said Peter Reading, interim chief executive of Peterborough and Stamford hospitals foundation trust. \"This movement reflects the fact that the trust will not now receive the planned PFI structural support of \u00a322m in 2011-12.\" PFIs allow private companies to fund the building of hospitals and mental health units, while the NHS pays for the facilities over a number of years. The scheme has been heavily criticised for being poor value for money and leaving trusts with major deficits. It can also be difficult for a trust to extricate themselves from a PFI deal once they are locked into a contract. Reading said despite the deficit, the news that short-term funding had been secured was positive. He also said it had achieved another important objective of getting the treasury to acknowledge that there are some trusts with unaffordable PFI payments. Reading took over as interim chief executive in February, replacing Louise Barnett, who had replaced Nik Patten in October 2011.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of people who retire could benefit from an average rise of 20% to their pension income after the launch of a code of conduct for annuity providers and a new annuity service to ensure pensioners are sold the right product. The Association of British Insurers, the trade body for insurance companies, has developed a new code designed to ensure insurers provide clear information to help people get the best income possible from their pension pots. The code requires insurers to redesign their information packs to highlight the importance of shopping around for an annuity \u2013 an insurance policy that converts a pension fund into retirement income. When an insurer sells an annuity to one of its own pension customers, it must ask a series of questions to match the right type of policy to the customer's needs. In particular, it must identify whether the customer could qualify for an enhanced annuity, and tell the customer where he or she could buy one if the insurer does not provide this product. All insurers selling annuities will be required to publish their rates: currently those who only sell to their own pension customers \u2013 including Scottish Widows and Friends Life \u2013 are not required to publish their rates in the open market. Opening up the rates to comparison will enable customers to gauge whether their existing pension company is offering them a good deal. The announcement of the ABI code coincides with the launch of a branch-based annuity service by Nationwide building society, which bases its recommendations on products from a panel of six leading annuity providers: Aviva, Canada Life, Just Retirement, Legal &amp; General, LV= and Partnership. The society's annuity service is available on a non-advised or advised basis to people with a pension pot of \u00a318,000 or more. More than half of those approaching retirement do not shop around for the best rates for an annuity and may potentially lose tens of thousands of pounds over the course of their retirement. Research by one annuity provider, Just Retirement, indicates that up to 70% of people could be entitled to an enhanced annuity because of medical conditions or lifestyle choices, such as smoking, resulting in their income rising by as much as 50%. But Stephen Lowe, director of Just Retirement, says: \"Currently 12% of all people buying annuities get an enhanced one. Of the 66% who buy an annuity from their existing pension provider, just 1% end up with an enhanced annuity.\" The ABI has already compelled its members to remove their own annuity application forms from the retirement packs sent out to their pension customers to reduce the danger of them going for the easiest, but not necessarily best option. However, those approaching retirement in the next year must still ensure they are fully informed. Although the code comes into force with immediate effect, insurers need only implement it by 1 March 2013. Laith Khalaf, pensions expert with the independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, said the code did not automatically apply to non-ABI members, including trust-based, defined contribution occupational pension schemes, which have about 1 million contributing members and 1.2 million non-contributing. He said: \"These schemes are regulated by the pensions regulator, which does have a code which is similar in substance, but it's a statement of practice \u2013 something that should be aspired to rather than saying 'this must happen'.\" Some occupational schemes have failed to provide sufficient information to members about their annuity options: research conducted by the pensions regulator in 2009 indicated that although 98% of defined contribution occupational schemes offered members the choice of shopping around for an annuity, some 30% had made alleged legislative breaches of retirement disclosure regulations. Khalaf said this problem could be solved through the planned development of a directory of annuity brokers, which could be available in retirement packs.",

      "bodyText": "The Russian presidential election was \"clearly skewed\" in favour of Vladimir Putin, an international team of observers has concluded. Their report has fuelled opposition activists' anger at Putin's return to the presidency. Tonino Picula, the head of an observer mission run by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said the result was never in doubt and the vote had offered no genuine competition. \"The point of elections is that the outcome should be uncertain. This was not the case in Russia,\" he said. According to the central elections commission, Putin won nearly 64% of the vote. Opposition leaders have denounced the result as \"illegitimate\" and have promised to bring thousands of people onto the streets to protest on Monday evening. Their anger has been fuelled by widespread reports of fraud, including evidence of ballot-stuffing and \"carousel voting\", when voters are employed to cast their votes several times at various polling sites. The OSCE said that while the process of voting was \"assessed positively overall\", problems began after the polls closed, with irregularities registered at almost one-third of polling stations during the count. They called for all irregularities to be investigated. \"There were serious problems from the very start of this election,\" the group said in a statement,\" the group said in a statement. \"There was no real competition and abuse of government resources ensured that the ultimate winner of the election was never in doubt.\" Putin's campaign chief has called the election the cleanest in Russia's history. Announcing his victory on Sunday night, Putin said he had won \"an open and honest battle\". Vladimir Churov, the head of the Russian election commission, built on Putin's rhetoric that the opposition protests that have rocked Russia since a similarly contested parliamentary vote in December were being directed from the west. Denouncing foreign election missions on Monday, Churov said some observers were looking for \"military and political information\" under the guise of seeking electoral violations. \"More and more often, monitors feel the irresistible desire to penetrate border zones, closed nuclear sites, missile centres and so on,\" he said on Monday. The Kremlin deployed around 12,000 police and an extra 6,300 interior ministry troops around the capital again on Monday. More radical elements inside the protest movement have called on people to set up a tent camp. The Kremlin has said it will not allow any \"provocations\", and pro-Kremlin youth activists were also gearing up to gather in the evening. As results poured in from around the country, it became clear that Putin had lost his grip on the capital. He failed to break the 50% barrier in Moscow, taking 47% of votes. Opposition activists said this still appeared too high, and cited evidence of vote-rigging. The billionaire challenger Mikhail Prokhorov, who has battled claims that his relatively liberal candidacy was a Kremlin project to deflect protest anger, took second place in the capital with just over 20%. Outside Moscow, the Communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, came in a distant second, as had been expected. \"Putin has named himself the emperor of Russia for the next 12 years,\" Alexey Navalny, a protest leader, said on Sunday. \"We announced earlier that we will not recognise these elections. The powers here are illegitimate.\" In an apparent bid to ease tensions, the outgoing president, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Monday that he had ordered the prosecutor general to study the legality of 32 criminal cases, including the jailing of the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a prominent liberal cause. He also told the Russian justice minister to explain why the liberal opposition Parnas movement had been refused party registration. The opposition shrugged off the move. \"It's clear that Medvedev wants to leave good memories of himself and to demonstrate his commitment to the truth,\" the Parnas leader and former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov told Interfax. \"The main task has been fulfilled \u2013 Putin has returned to the Kremlin, and it's again time for Medvedev to carry out an imitation of liberal tendencies in political life.\"",

Most of us have an instinctive opinion about whether it is a good idea for churches, mosques and synagogues to have a hand in educating young people. David Cameron, like Tony Blair before him, believes religion fosters a \"culture and ethos\" that supports learning. Many an atheist would disagree, as would devout believers such as Rabbi Jonathan Romain who want to see faiths mingling, as opposed to pupils being clumped together on the basis of creed. Gut instincts about whether faith schools should exist in the first place colour all judgment on the secondary question about how well they serve the poor. Every middle-class Londoner hears tales of godless parents suddenly attending church before putting their child up for a thriving school where this helps. But religion is one of civil society's surest routes into poor communities, and there are devotees \u2013 including some faith school teachers and sponsors \u2013 who radiate a commitment to help pupils from the bottom of the heap. So there are enough anecdotes about both posh parents playing the system and poor kids being touched by divinely inspired instruction to cater for all prejudices. Naturally, this position fuels a debate that leads nowhere. Enter the database of English faith schools, which the Guardian releases today. It at last allows the official numbers to be crunched \u2013 so we can see what sorts of pupils attend faith schools, but crucially also how these compare to the wider mix of pupils locally. The picture is varied, but worrying overall. There are plenty of individual faith establishments which do take more than their share of the poor, and tentative signs that schools connected to poorer faith communities \u2013 evangelicals and Muslims \u2013 reach right down to the dispossessed. But most Anglican schools do appear disproportionately to serve the better-heeled parts of their communities. For Catholics, who have made great play of their inclusion and successively fought to control influence over admissions, the results are even more skewed. There are of course noble exceptions, but overall the data points to pausing for thought before sanctioning a dash for more faith schools. There are many complexities: where councils and churches both have a hand in school management things can get even more elitist than when a church is in sole command. Understanding such patterns will take much more detailed work, but is indispensable if lessons are to be learned. Too many academic papers meekly conclude with a request for another research cheque.

Reports in the Caribbean said the 33-year-old lost control of his vehicle while driving and was killed when he crashed into a utility pole. Morton played in 15 Tests and 56 one-day internationals for West Indies, and his last appearance for his country came against Australia in a Twenty20 international in 2010. While he averaged 22.03 in Tests he had more success in the limited-overs game. He averaged 33.75, with the highlight an unbeaten 110 against New Zealand in 2006. The president of the West Indies Cricket Board, Dr Julian Hunte, said: \"Runako's passing, still in the prime of life, leaves us all in shock. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends as we all try to come to terms with his loss. \"He will be remembered as a fierce competitor on the field who gave no quarter whether he was playing for West Indies, Leeward Islands, Nevis or Trinidad &amp; Tobago.\" Several of Morton's team-mates paid tribute on Twitter. The former Windies captain, Chris Gayle, said: \"We lost a True Warrior. WI cricketer Runako Morton \u2013 may his soul rest in peace! Our memories together Live On! My condolences to his family.\" The former all-rounder Wavell Hinds tweeted: \"Gone far too soon brother Runako. I will treasure the great memories for sure. RIP God knows best,\" while Rayad Emrit, who played with Morton for Trinidad, said: \"RIP Morton. You'll always be remembered buddy. Gone but NEVER forgotten.

      "bodyText": "To the surprise of virtually no-one, Vladimir Putin has won a landslide vistory in Russia's presidential elections. As also seemed inevitable, electoral observers and Putin's opponents alike have reported allegations of widespread electoral fraud, as the Guardian Russia correspondent Miriam Elder reports: Two women hover over a ballot box in the industrial Russian city of Cherepovets, stuffing in ballot after ballot. On the streets of Moscow, an independent election monitor armed with an iPhone trails a van full of \"carousel\" voters \u2013 people bussed from polling site to polling site in order to cast multiple votes for Vladimir Putin. Three months after Moscow exploded in a storm of fury over allegedly widespread electoral fraud during the country's parliamentary vote, Russians went to the polls to vote against or, mostly, for Vladimir Putin in his quest to return to the presidency. Putin quickly claimed victory, waiting until just over 20% of votes were counted, but his opponents just as quickly cried foul, armed with reels of evidence of alleged fraud. They uploaded them by the thousands to their Twitter accounts and LiveJournal blogs, helping the indignation go viral. Measuring the scale of electoral fraud is always a challenge. Confirming some irregularities have taken place is (relatively) straightforward, but proving whether fraud is systemic or isolate is vastly more difficult. In many aspects of life, however, there is a statistical trick that can find large-scale fraud, particularly in finance. In short, it's that far more numbers start with a \"1\" than you'd think: in a normal ledger book without fraud, around a third of the figures (whether \u00a317.20 or \u00a31.16bn) would be expected to begin with a 1. This pattern continues throughout the digits, and is known as Benford's law (a fuller explanation can be found here) We've taken results from just over 2,150 polling stations submitted by Russia's election observers to a Russian-language site here. These aren't the verified official results, but give us a much bigger dataset to check than those would. We then grouped together the results for all candidates. Did the results comply to Benford's law? The short answer is no, as shown in the graph below: The results for Putin's vote share alone were even more striking, and it's worth noting the difference was statistically significant in both cases: Does this mean the statistics show Russia's results were subject to fraud? Unfortunately, as my colleague Ben Goldacre \u2013 who helpfully did some of the number-crunching for this piece (though all errors are mine) \u2013 is fond of saying, it's a bit more complicated than that. Each polling station within this set of data has a relatively tight range of votes: between three and around 2,600. This makes it unlike most data in, say, financial accounts, due to lack of variance, and can mean data doesn't comply to the Benford pattern even when totally legitimate. Whether Benford's Law has potential for finding political fraud is a matter of contention. A study by Joseph Deckert, Mikhail Myagkov and Peter C. Ordeshook published in August 2011 concluded not: It is not simply that the Law occasionally judges a fraudulent election fair or a fair election fraudulent. Its \"success rate\" either way is essentially equivalent to a toss of a coin, thereby rendering it problematical at best as a forensic tool and wholly misleading at worst. However, this piece quickly received a response from a professor at the University of Michigan, Walter Mebane: The paper mistakenly associates such a test with Benford's Law, considers a simulation exercise that has no apparent relevance for any actual election, applies the test to inappropriate levels of aggregation, and ignores existing analysis of recent elections in Russia ... Whether the tests are useful for detecting fraud remains an open question, but approaching this question requires an approach more nuanced and tied to careful analysis of real election data than one sees in the discussed paper. Data-driven investigations clearly offer intriguing potential for catching widespread fraud, whether financial or political. But it also seems the scope and potential of this method and others are far from a subject of consensus. We've published the full data from the electoral observers below.

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Sidney said he had merely \"slipt into the title of a Poet,\" perhaps with some truth, since Queen Elizabeth I mistrusted him, and left him sometimes under-employed in her service. He nevertheless wrote a powerful Defence of Poesie which has resonance for our own time. \"The poet nothing affirmeth and therefore never lieth,\" he famously claimed, and much practice and theory still agree with him. The \"Defence\" reminds us that poetry in England (though not in Wales or Ireland) had its mocking detractors even in that Elizabethan golden age. Serious as his arguments are, Sidney's peroration culminates playfully, with a curse: he warns the detractors of poetry that \"while you live you live in love and never get favour for lacking skill of a Sonet, and when you die your memorie die from the earth for want of an Epitaph\". One of the great works that form Sidney's own Epitaph, \"Astrophel and Stella\" was composed in 1582, four years before his death. The collection of sonnets and songs is sometimes known as \"Astrophil and Stella\", the spelling reminding us of the pun implicit in the masculine name. The Star-Lover is of course the poet, and the Star in question is thought to have been Penelope Devereux, who married Lord Robert Rich in 1581 (see Sonnet 37 for its almost wild punning on the word \"rich\".) If star-loving Philip never received Stella's favours, it wasn't for lack of a Sonet, nor lack of skill. This week's poem is a deserved favourite, the memorable No 31 \"With how sad steps O Moone \u2026\" It's the grammatical unexpectedness of \"how\" which first arrests the attention. Imagine if Sidney had used the flatly un-noticeable \"what\": \"With what sad steps, O Moone, thou climbs't the skies \u2026\" Would we even read on? Sidney chooses a word that invites ambiguity, presenting it through an idiom that seems, to this reader, at least, not quite native to the register of courtly English. The repetition of the word in \"How silently\" and \"how wanne a face\" in line 2 is unexceptional, of course. But \"how sad steps\" is almost ungrammatical, a casual shorthand for \"how sad a step\". And yet it works brilliantly. It evokes a compound, \"how-sad\" which intensifies \"sad\" to \"very, very sad\", and, of course, also suggests the exclamation \"how sad!\" But \"how\" also signifies a technical puzzle, as in \"How is it done?\" How does the moon walk when it's so sad: how does it manage to move, and how is the sadness expressed in movement? The poet \"nothing affirmeth\" but he suggests an arresting visual image. The notion of the moon taking steps might have been idiotic, but, by letting the question \"how does a moon walk?\" sink in subconsciously, the line pushes us to imagine that shambling, pathetic progress. Like an unhappy courtier, perhaps, the moon-man seeks to rise, but is frustrated. And, of course, we also see the letter O \u2013 five times in the first line. Is this, as a later poet said of the moon \"the O-gape of complete despair?\" Maybe not, but the Os certainly help reveal the planet's face. The \"what\" we happily avoided in line 1 appears in line 3, a rhetorical \"What, may it be \u2026\" used simply as an exclamation, to emphasise that this is another loaded question. The \"busie archer\" line is brisk, and suggests quick-fire activity on the part of the celestial Cupid. The following line slows the pace, and includes the wonderfully extenuated compound adjective, usually hyphenated: \"long-with-love-acquainted eyes\". Now the moon's more conventional and literary history is asserted. It has long been associated with sighing lovers. The victim who experiences love's arrow first-hand has become ageless witness. This representation still avoids being dull. The moon as goddess would be dull (and after all, the poet has a Star for his goddess), but, as a wise observer and wan fellow-sufferer, the poet-lover's own surrogate, \"he\" commands emotional authenticity and attention. Some commentators suggest that the moon changes from person to a planet in the sestet. I don't see why. The poet still addresses the moon (\"Then ev'n of fellowship, O Moone, tell me \u2026\") and \"there\" (line 10) surely doesn't denote \"on the moon\". It refers, I think, to the sky, the \"heavenly place\" the moon inhabits. The turn brings in a series of further questions. They are even more plainly designed to illuminate the speaker's own experience. The moon recedes somewhat, as the earthly lover enumerates his injuries in swift, concise succession. The word \"love\" in some grammatical form appears five times in as many lines: the effect is far from merely playful. \"Above\" in line 12 adds an internal rhyme, and further rich ambiguity. \"Do they above love to be loved\" signifies physical place, of course, \"above\" as \"up there in the heavens\", but it also implies that the Beauties love to be loved \"above\" anything else, and, what's worse, are \"above\" love when asked to give rather than receive it. Constantly honing his sense of ingratitude, the lover scorned eventually turns the tables: there's a strong hint that those who are loved unrequitedly are hypocrites in calling their \"ungratefulness\" virtue. While the use of plurals (lovers, beauties) creates a supposed impersonality, Sidney is far from unemotional. As a structure determined by the outer fabric of rhetorical questions, the poem is a display of controlled pressure to speak out. In concluding with a rhyming couplet, Sidney departs from his Petrarchan model. Emphasis is gained, although the rhymes are far from harsh. \"Possess\" and \"ungratefulness\" return us to the tenderly sibilant rhyme-sounds which infused the octet, and which the sestet had initially interrupted with those crisp, masculine CDCD rhymes, \"me\", \"wit\", \"be\", \"yet\". Sidney has obeyed his own injunction in Sonnet 1: \"Looke in thy heart and write.\" His personal signature lets him revitalise already well-worn themes. But without the reading, the thorough study of literary models, his heart would probably not have yielded very much of a poem, and certainly not the stellar performance we have here. Sonnet XXXI With how sad steps, O Moone, thou climb'st the skies! How silently, and with how wanne a face! What, may it be that even in heavenly place That busy archer his sharpe arrowes tries? Sure, if that long-with-Love-acquainted eyes Can judge of love, thou feel'st a Lover's case; I read it in thy lookes; thy languisht grace To me that feele the like, thy state descries. Then, even of fellowship, O Moone, tell me, Is constant Love deem'd there but want of wit? Are beauties there as proud as here they be? Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet Those Lovers scorn whom that Love doth possesse? Do they call vertue there, ungratefulnesse?",

      "bodyText": "How much do faith schools reflect their local communities? Are they becoming middle class islands in poorer areas? Andrew Brown writes that: A faith character is often taken to be a signal of a good or successful school. Once that happens, the process will be self-sustaining in the Darwinian world of modern education, where schools must compete for success or die We looked at key Department for Education data released with the exam results at the end of this year to create a complete picture of England's religious education system. What does the data show? England's faith state schools are on average failing to mirror their local communities by shunning the poorest pupils in their area, an analysis by the Guardian of the latest government figures shows. The Roman Catholic Church, which has repeatedly insisted that its schools are \"inclusive\", comes out as particularly unrepresentative of the local communities it serves. Three-quarters of Catholic primary and secondary schools have a more affluent mix of pupils than their local area. Here are the key numbers: \u2022 Some 73% of Catholic primaries and 72% of Catholic secondaries have a lower proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than the average of all children schooled across its local authority \u2022 The same is the case for Church of England primary and secondary schools. Some 74% of the Church's primaries and 65.5% of its secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is average for the local authority \u2022 In contrast, half \u2013 51% \u2013 of non-religious primaries and 45% of non-religious secondaries have a lower proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is representative for their local authority At a very local level, we compared the proportion of poor pupils in each postcode with the proportion of poor pupils in faith schools and non-faith schools studying in that postcode. The data shows: \u2022 76% of Catholic primaries and 65% of Catholic secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is representative of their postcode \u2022 This is the case for 63.5% of Church of England primaries and 40% of Church of England secondaries \u2022 Non-religious primaries and secondaries are far more likely to mirror the proportion of poor pupils in their postcode \u2013 just 47% of non-faith primaries and 29% of non-faith secondaries take a smaller proportion of free school meals than is representative for their postcode Who runs the schools? A large number of the schools, 4,205, are 'Voluntary Aided' (VA), which are allowed to set their own entrance levels, the vast majority of which are faith schools where the local church is part of the governing body. In fact, Church voluntary aided, foundation and academies all have their admissions set by the Governing body (taking into account diocesan advice and obviously within the Government's admissions code). Church voluntary controlled schools have their admissions set by local authority. Only 13 out of 3,689 VA schools are non-religious, only 38 out 2,497 VC schools are non-religious. The results appear to show that where the school is in charge of its admissions policy, it has fewer free school meals pupils. \u2022 72.4% of VA schools have less than the local authority figure for free school meals, compared to 42.9% of community schools \u2022 The gap is bigger at a very local level: 61.1% of VA schools have less than the postcode figure for free school meals, compared to 26.9% of community schools Why free school meals? Free school meals are a key accessibility indicator, as only the least well-off children are eligible for them. Parents do not have to pay for school lunches if they receive any of the following: \u2022 Income Support \u2022 income-based Jobseeker's Allowance \u2022 income-related Employment and Support Allowance \u2022 support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 \u2022 the Guarantee element of State Pension Credit \u2022 Child Tax Credit, provided they are not entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual income (as assessed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs) that does not exceed \u00a316,190 \u2022 Working Tax Credit 'run-on' - the payment someone may receive for a further four weeks after they stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit The spending database records the percentage of free school meals in each school and the total number of pupils in each school. The official data bands schools into three types: less than 20.0% FSM is LOW; Medium: 20.1%-35.0% and High: &gt;35.0%. Where does the data come from? The data was published by the Department for Education as part of primary SATs test and Secondary exam results earlier this year. Our results come from combining two datasets: individual state school spending figures and the \"spine\", which is the Department for Education list of every school in England with address, school type and religious denomination details provided to the press during the exam results. What we have done is take the total number of pupils eligible for free school meal at schools in each area - both at local authority and postcode levels - from the spending database and merged it with the address an school data in the Spine. That allows us to compare compared individual schools and their areas. The entire database covers all 20,599 state schools in England, over 80% of which are primary schools. How did we get here? Firstly, we excluded a lot of schools. We took out 943 special schools (5% of the total) and the 122 selective secondary schools which is a big enough number to sway the results. That leaves 16,781 primary schools and 2,753 secondary schools in our sample - for which we know the type of school, denomination, admissions policy and address. Because we have the addresses and postcodes of each school - as well as the percentage of free school meal pupils there - we can work out the numbers of free school meal pupils in each postcode are and each local authority. We aggregated these numbers to give us proportions and totals for each area - rather than just averaging the percentages from each school. We debated doing it that way and if we had done, the results might have appeared to be more dramatic but would have overplayed quite small schools with a large percentage - but a small number - of FSM pupils. We also had to take into account the 708 schools where the FSM numbers are \"suppressed\", ie not published because they are only one or two students. One big area of disagreement is whether you take the postcodes for where pupils actually live, or you do what we did, which is to compare each school to all the schools in their area. We decided to go for the latter as we wanted to see how each school compares to its peers in the area. Other faith schools We concentrated on Church of England and Roman Catholic schools as these are the vast bulk of faith schools. Although other faiths are interesting - and you can see their results in the interactive map - the numbers are too much smaller to be a meaningful sample: there are only 11 state Muslim schools in England and 38 Jewish schools. In terms of other Christian schools, there is a total of 106.

      "body": "<p>How much do faith schools reflect their local communities? Are they becoming middle class islands in poorer areas? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/feb/24/faith-schools-darwinian-modern-education\">Andrew Brown writes that</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A faith character is often taken to be a signal of a good or successful school. Once that happens, the process will be self-sustaining in the Darwinian world of modern education, where schools must compete for success or die</p> </blockquote> <p>We looked at <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/download_data.html\">key Department for Education data</a> released with the exam results at the end of this year to create a complete picture of England's religious education system.</p> <h2>What does the data show?</h2> <p>England's faith state schools are on average failing to mirror their local communities by shunning the poorest pupils in their area, an analysis by the Guardian of the latest government figures shows.</p> <p>The Roman Catholic Church, which has repeatedly insisted that its schools are \"inclusive\", comes out as particularly unrepresentative of the local communities it serves. Three-quarters of Catholic primary and secondary schools have a more affluent mix of pupils than their local area.</p> <p>Here are the key numbers:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 Some 73% of Catholic primaries and 72% of Catholic secondaries have a lower proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than the average of all children schooled across its local authority<br>\u2022 The same is the case for Church of England primary and secondary schools. Some 74% of the Church's primaries and 65.5% of its secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is average for the local authority<br>\u2022 In contrast, half \u2013 51% \u2013 of non-religious primaries and 45% of non-religious secondaries have a lower proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is representative for their local authority</p> </blockquote> <p>At a very local level, we compared the proportion of poor pupils in each postcode with the proportion of poor pupils in faith schools and non-faith schools studying in that postcode. The data shows:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 76% of Catholic primaries and 65% of Catholic secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is representative of their postcode<br>\u2022 This is the case for 63.5% of Church of England primaries and 40% of Church of England secondaries<br>\u2022 Non-religious primaries and secondaries are far more likely to mirror the proportion of poor pupils in their postcode \u2013 just 47% of non-faith primaries and 29% of non-faith secondaries take a smaller proportion of free school meals than is representative for their postcode</p> </blockquote> <h2>Who runs the schools?</h2> <p>A large number of the schools, 4,205, are 'Voluntary Aided' (VA), which are allowed to set their own entrance levels, the vast majority of which are faith schools where the local church is part of the governing body. In fact, Church voluntary aided, foundation and academies all have their admissions set by the Governing body (taking into account diocesan advice and obviously within the Government's admissions code). Church voluntary controlled schools have their admissions set by local authority. Only 13 out of 3,689 VA schools are non-religious, only 38 out 2,497 VC schools are non-religious. </p> <p>The results appear to show that where the school is in charge of its admissions policy, it has fewer free school meals pupils. </p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022&#xa0;72.4% of VA schools have less than the local authority figure for free school meals, compared to 42.9% of community schools<br>\u2022 The gap is bigger at a very local level: 61.1% of VA schools have less than the postcode figure for free school meals, compared to 26.9% of community schools</p> </blockquote> <h2>Why free school meals?</h2> <p>Free school meals are a key accessibility indicator, as only the least well-off children are eligible for them. <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Schoolslearninganddevelopment/SchoolLife/DG_4016089\">Parents do not have to pay for school lunches if they receive any of the following</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 Income Support<br>\u2022 income-based Jobseeker's Allowance<br>\u2022 income-related Employment and Support Allowance<br>\u2022 support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999<br>\u2022 the Guarantee element of State Pension Credit<br>\u2022 Child Tax Credit, provided they are not entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual income (as assessed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs) that does not exceed \u00a316,190<br>\u2022 Working Tax Credit 'run-on' - the payment someone may receive for a further four weeks after they stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit</p> </blockquote> <p>The spending database records the percentage of free school meals in each school and the total number of pupils in each school. The official data bands schools into three types: less than 20.0% FSM is LOW; Medium: 20.1%-35.0% and High: &gt;35.0%.</p> <h2>Where does the data come from?</h2> <p>The data was published by the Department for Education as part of primary SATs test and Secondary exam results earlier this year. Our results come from combining two datasets: individual state school spending figures and the \"spine\", which is the Department for Education list of every school in England with address, school type and religious denomination details provided to the press during the exam results. What we have done is take the total number of pupils eligible for free school meal at schools in each area - both at local authority and postcode levels - from the spending database and merged it with the address an school data in the Spine. That allows us to compare compared individual schools and their areas.</p> <p>The entire database covers all 20,599 state schools in England, over 80% of which are primary schools.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386888569\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/02/26/SCHOOLS460.jpg\" alt=\"Faith schools interactive\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Click image to explore our interactive guide</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <h2>How did we get here?</h2> <p>Firstly, we excluded a lot of schools. We took out 943 special schools (5% of the total) and the 122 selective secondary schools which is a big enough number to sway the results. That leaves 16,781 primary schools and 2,753 secondary schools in our sample - for which we know the type of school, denomination, admissions policy and address. </p> <p>Because we have the addresses and postcodes of each school - as well as the percentage of free school meal pupils there - we can work out the numbers of free school meal pupils in each postcode are and each local authority. We aggregated these numbers to give us proportions and totals for each area - rather than just averaging the percentages from each school. We debated doing it that way and if we had done, the results might have appeared to be more dramatic but would have overplayed quite small schools with a large percentage - but a small number - of FSM pupils.</p> <p>We also had to take into account the 708 schools where the FSM numbers are \"suppressed\", ie not published because they are only one or two students.</p> <p>One big area of disagreement is whether you take the postcodes for where pupils actually live, or you do what we did, which is to compare each school to all the schools in their area. We decided to go for the latter as we wanted to see how each school compares to its peers in the area. </p> <h2>Other faith schools</h2> <p>We concentrated on Church of England and Roman Catholic schools as these are the vast bulk of faith schools. Although other faiths are interesting - and you can see their results in the interactive map - the numbers are too much smaller to be a meaningful sample: there are only 11 state Muslim schools in England and 38 Jewish schools. In terms of other Christian schools, there is a total of 106. If you do decide to ignore the fact then appears to show that Muslim schools, for instance, would appear to be more reflective of their area than Jewish schools, say.

We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy's own insights. Here are this week's dilemmas \u2013 what are your thoughts? Problem one: My partner puts everything into his job \u2013 shouldn't he be better rewarded? My partner has a problem at work which he is finding very difficult to deal with, and it is making him feel undervalued and depressed. He works as literature officer for a charity. He runs an entire section and, as an experienced professional and a writer in his own right, has brought a wealth of new developments, contacts and credibility to the organisation. When he took up the post three years ago my partner negotiated a slightly higher salary than was offered, but there has been no further increase, despite him growing the role considerably and receiving a lot of acclaim for his work both within the organisation and outside. Six months ago he approached the director to discuss whether he could be upgraded to be part of the management team along with a modest increase in salary. His post is historically not part of the management team, although he manages the entire literature section of the organisation and is responsible for staff and interns. The director turned down my partner's request on both counts. His reasons were that while he recognises my partner's excellent work he doesn't want to add to the management group and nor does he feel that he can increase one staff member's salary without offering the same to others, and the organisation can't afford it. My partner feels that this is just an excuse for maintaining the status quo, as there is a history within the organisation of hiring people by word-of-mouth from backgrounds where they do not really need the salary. My partner was the first person to be hired through open recruiting, due to pressure from funders, and was selected for his experience rather than his connections. On the plus side, the organisation is supportive of my partner attending professional development events and taking time off when he needs to for his own writing and readings, although he generally takes this as annual leave or unpaid. There are very few jobs in this field of work and my partner feels that he is working to the maximum of what is possible in his role, and to the limit of what he can earn with his own writing. We desperately need the increase in salary, as we are struggling to afford to live in an expensive part of the country. Problem two: My voluntary redundancy wasn't entirely through choice I have just entered \"voluntary\" redundancy, having spent most of the previous two years working on a part-time basis. Unfortunately, although I was part-time, the work wasn't, resulting in me either working my other hours for nothing (which I did for a while) or not doing my job properly. As a result of the latter option I ended up stressed out to the point that I thought I was heading for a nervous breakdown. My previous manager left and the new guy, seeing my obvious distress and the state of the work I had been doing, offered me a way out, so long as I applied for voluntary redundancy. I could see no option other than to agree with him, and took up the offer. Ironically, they have now appointed two people (one full-time, one agency) to do my work. I don't know what to do next. My confidence is shattered and I'm seriously considering taking on an easy job to avoid any repeat of the stress I encountered before. It feels as though I am throwing away over 30 years of experience. \u2022 For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@guardian.co.uk.

      "bodyText": "England's faith state schools are failing to mirror their local communities by shunning the poorest pupils in their area, analysis by the Guardian of the latest government figures shows. The Roman Catholic church, which has repeatedly insisted its schools are inclusive, comes out particularly badly in the examination of data published by the Department for Education (DfE) last month and in December. Three-quarters of Catholic primary and secondary schools have a more affluent mix of pupils than their local area. The figures also reveal that most Church of England (CofE) primary schools have an intake that is untypically affluent and more middle-class than a year ago. The findings will fuel claims that faith schools have been picking pupils from well-off families by selecting on the basis of religion. The Guardian analysed the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals \u2013 a key indicator of poverty \u2013 in each of England's 19,534 state, non-selective primary and secondary schools. All schools designated for children with special needs were taken out. The schools have been grouped according to whether they are affiliated to the CofE, the Catholic church or have no religious character. The number of state-funded Muslim and Jewish schools is too small to form a meaningful group \u2013 however, the 11 state-funded Muslim schools in England are collectively more reflective of their community, with 67% of primaries and 60% of secondaries having more than the local authority average of free school meal pupils. The 36 Jewish state schools on average have less representation of pupils on free school meals than their local area. There are many Christian schools connected to other denominations, but the data does not specify which denomination. The proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals in each CofE, Catholic or non-religious school was compared with the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals in their local authority and among all the comparable schools in the same postcode area. It is well-known that the average proportion of deprived pupils in faith schools is lower than it is for all schools in England. However, it has not until now been clear whether this is a facet of the areas they serve. Our analysis shows for the first time the extent to which faith and non-faith schools reflect \u2013 or fail to reflect \u2013 the proportion of poor pupils in their area. The vast majority of Catholic primary and secondary schools fail to mirror the proportion of poor pupils living in their community, the data reveals. The Catholic church has fought successful battles to retain control of admissions to its schools. Some 73% of Catholic primaries and 72% of Catholic secondaries have a lower proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than the average for the local authority. It is the same for CofE primary and secondary schools. Some 74% of these primaries and 65.5% of secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is average for the local authority. In contrast, non-religious schools tend to reflect their neighbourhoods. Half (51%) of non-religious primaries and 45% of non-religious secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is representative for their local authority. Faith schools fared no better when examined at a more local level. We compared the proportion of poor pupils in each postcode with the proportion of poor pupils in faith schools and non-faith schools studying in that postcode. The data shows 76% of Catholic primaries and 65% of Catholic secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is representative of their postcode. This is the case for 63.5% of CofE primaries and 40% of CofE secondaries. Non-religious primaries and secondaries are far more likely to mirror the proportion of poor pupils in their postcode \u2013 just 47% of non-faith primaries and 29% of non-faith secondaries take a smaller proportion of free school meals than is representative for their postcode. Anna Vignoles, a professor of the economics of education at the Institute of Education, University of London, said the Guardian's findings could be explained by the fact that faith schools draw their pupils from their faith communities, which are not necessarily located in the same postcode or area as their school. A study by Dr Rebecca Allen and Professor Anne West of the Institute of Education and the London School of Economics, published in 2011, showed that middle class parents are more likely to apply to faith schools \u2013 and that the admissions procedures there are easier for them to navigate. Our data also shows that CofE primary schools are increasingly serving the better-heeled in their communities. Whereas this year 74% of the church's primaries have a smaller proportion of the poorest pupils than their local authority, the year before 72% did. At a more local level, the same is the case. This year, 63.5% of the church's primaries have a smaller proportion of the poorest pupils than their postcode, compared to 60% last year. Maeve McCormack, policy manager at the Catholic Education Service, said Catholic schools appeared not to reflect their communities in our data because their catchment areas were geographically wider than the postcode or local authority where the schools were situated. She said separate figures from the DfE showed 18.6% of pupils at Catholic primary schools live in the 10% most deprived areas of England, compared with only 14.3% of primary school pupils nationally. Some 17% of pupils at Catholic schools lived in the 10% most deprived areas compared to 12% of pupils nationally. The DfE calculates the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals based on how many families apply for this benefit. McCormack said that because there was a \"cultural stigma\" attached to claiming free school meals, fewer than the expected number of pupils were reported to be on the benefit. A spokesman for the CofE said local authorities controlled the admissions of more than half its schools. The church rejected the idea that those schools that controlled their own admissions were failing to mirror their local communities. \"The current government agenda to narrow the differential attainment between groups was the priority of the founders of church school education 200 years ago, when providing a basic education for the poor was not seen as a state responsibility,\" the spokesman said. \"This remains the driver for all that we continue to do today. That is why the church is the largest sponsor of academies, mostly in deprived areas where the schools had a history of under-performance. \"These academies have opened up new opportunities and new life chances for nearly 45,000 young people, all living in disadvantaged areas \u2013 a clear example of the outworking of the church's mission in education.\" Richy Thompson from the British Humanist Association said the data gave \"further cause for concern that allowing religious discrimination within our state system exacerbates socioeconomic inequality as well as being religiously and ethnically divisive\". He said: \"We urge the government to end faith-based selection in all state-funded schools.\" Our analysis found some particularly egregious examples of schools \u2013 both Catholic and CofE \u2013 that take far fewer numbers of pupils eligible for free school meals than is representative of their area. In St John's Church of England primary in Croydon, south London, just 7% of pupils are eligible for free school meals, compared with 29% across the postcode and 24% across the local authority. Meanwhile, at St James's Catholic primary school in Richmond, south-west London, only 1% of pupils are eligible for free school meals, compared with 10% across the postcode and local authority.",

      "body": "<p>England's faith state schools are failing to mirror their local communities by shunning the poorest pupils in their area, analysis by the Guardian of the latest government figures shows.</p> <p>The Roman Catholic church, which has repeatedly insisted its schools are inclusive, comes out particularly badly in the examination of data published by the Department for Education (DfE) last month and in December. Three-quarters of Catholic primary and secondary schools have a more affluent mix of pupils than their local area.</p> <p>The figures also reveal that most Church of England (CofE) primary schools have an intake that is untypically affluent and more middle-class than a year ago. The findings will fuel claims that faith schools have been picking pupils from well-off families by selecting on the basis of religion.</p> <p>The Guardian analysed the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals \u2013 a key indicator of poverty \u2013 in each of England's 19,534 state, non-selective primary and secondary schools. All schools designated for children with special needs were taken out.</p> <p>The schools have been grouped according to whether they are affiliated to the CofE, the Catholic church or have no religious character. The number of state-funded Muslim and Jewish schools is too small to form a meaningful group \u2013 however, the 11 state-funded Muslim schools in England are collectively more reflective of their community, with 67% of primaries and 60% of secondaries having more than the local authority average of free school meal pupils. The 36 Jewish state schools on average have less representation of pupils on free school meals than their local area. There are many Christian schools connected to other denominations, but the data does not specify which denomination.</p> <p>The proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals in each CofE, Catholic or non-religious school was compared with the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals in their local authority and among all the comparable schools in the same postcode area.</p> <p>It is well-known that the average proportion of deprived pupils in faith schools is lower than it is for all schools in England. However, it has not until now been clear whether this is a facet of the areas they serve. Our analysis shows for the first time the extent to which faith and non-faith schools reflect \u2013 or fail to reflect \u2013 the proportion of poor pupils in their area.</p> <p>The vast majority of Catholic primary and secondary schools fail to mirror the proportion of poor pupils living in their community, the data reveals. The Catholic church has fought successful battles to retain control of admissions to its schools.</p> <p>Some 73% of Catholic primaries and 72% of Catholic secondaries have a lower proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than the average for the local authority.</p> <p>It is the same for CofE primary and secondary schools. Some 74% of these primaries and 65.5% of secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is average for the local authority.</p> <p>In contrast, non-religious schools tend to reflect their neighbourhoods. Half (51%) of non-religious primaries and 45% of non-religious secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is representative for their local authority.</p> <p>Faith schools fared no better when examined at a more local level. We compared the proportion of poor pupils in each postcode with the proportion of poor pupils in faith schools and non-faith schools studying in that postcode. The data shows 76% of Catholic primaries and 65% of Catholic secondaries have a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than is representative of their postcode. This is the case for 63.5% of CofE primaries and 40% of CofE secondaries.</p> <p>Non-religious primaries and secondaries are far more likely to mirror the proportion of poor pupils in their postcode \u2013 just 47% of non-faith primaries and 29% of non-faith secondaries take a smaller proportion of free school meals than is representative for their postcode.</p> <p>Anna Vignoles, a professor of the economics of education at the Institute of Education, University of London, said the Guardian's findings could be explained by the fact that faith schools draw their pupils from their faith communities, which are not necessarily located in the same postcode or area as their school.</p> <p>A study by Dr Rebecca Allen and Professor Anne West of the Institute of Education and the London School of Economics, published in 2011, showed that middle class parents are more likely to apply to faith schools \u2013 and that the admissions procedures there are easier for them to navigate.</p> <p>Our data also shows that CofE primary schools are increasingly serving the better-heeled in their communities.</p> <p>Whereas this year 74% of the church's primaries have a smaller proportion of the poorest pupils than their local authority, the year before 72% did.</p> <p>At a more local level, the same is the case. This year, 63.5% of the church's primaries have a smaller proportion of the poorest pupils than their postcode, compared to 60% last year.</p> <p>Maeve McCormack, policy manager at the <a href=\"http://www.cesew.org.uk\" title=\"\">Catholic Education Service</a>, said Catholic schools appeared not to reflect their communities in our data because their catchment areas were geographically wider than the postcode or local authority where the schools were situated.</p> <p>She said separate figures from the DfE showed 18.6% of pupils at Catholic primary schools live in the 10% most deprived areas of England, compared with only 14.3% of primary school pupils nationally.

      "bodyText": "Sunday afternoon, Radio City Music Hall, and rehearsals for the Secret Policeman's Ball were in full flow: Russell Brand was stalking the aisles and Eddie Izzard was lolling backstage as Richard Branson waited in the wings. Meanwhile Sarah Silverman stood on stage in a bobble hat, a red rucksack by her feet, making jokes about sperm. Jokes were re-written on the spot, sketches frantically re-jigged, and above it all hung the enticing question of whether or not, in just a few hours' time, this collection of comedians, actors and musicians would succeed in pulling off a spectacular gala performance. Celebrating 50 years of Amnesty International, this year's Ball was the first to take place on American soil and arguably the most high profile to date: performed to a crowd of 6,000 in New York, streamed live on US website Epix, and due to be broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on Friday 9 March, the three-hour show brought together a wealth of British and American comic talent: from Reggie Watts, Tim Roth and Liam Neeson to Kristen Wiig, as well as Jon Stewart, Catherine Tate, the Muppets, Coldplay and Zarganar, Burma's leading standup. The fun began a little past seven o'clock with a pre-recorded video: \"I'm Archbishop Desmond Tutu,\" announced the South African activist and Nobel peace prize recipient, \"and I'm a funny guy \u2026\" If the performances had a common theme, it was perhaps that of highlighting the differences between British and American humour: numerous plays on the word \"ass\", references to dentistry, customer service and a sketch which saw Ben Stiller and David Walliams running through a glossary of British and American linguistic differences. The differences were also there in each nation's respective comic styling. The American comedians were slick, well-scripted and savvy: a sketch that saw actor Rashida Jones and Saturday Night Live alumni Seth Meyers, Jason Sudeikis and Fred Armisen playing police state interrogators alongside Rex Lee from Entourage as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, for example, was a smart, impeccably-choreographed and elegantly-poised performance. Equally, there was an irrepressible joie de vivre \u2013 and an exuberant filth \u2013 to many of the British performances that was arguably better suited to the occasion: Izzard's infectious Franglais-ing, Peter Serafinowicz's turn as Paul McCartney, not to mention the unbridled smut of Jimmy Carr and Micky Flanagan; the cockney comedian earned the biggest single laugh of the night for his postulation that the rise in teenage pregnancy in the UK could be solely attributed to \"the decline of fingering\". Interspersed were a series of set pieces: the Muppets' favourite curmudgeons Statler and Waldorf, animated delinquents Beavis and Butt-head, as well as video messages from the Ball's Pythonian forefathers Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Terry Jones, all of whom blamed their inability to attend on the alleged loss of their legs. The real revelation of the night was Jack Whitehall, the 23-year-old comic from London. Prior to the show, Whitehall fretted about his youth and lack of US reputation, yet he succeeded in charming the audience with a combination of waistcoated foppishness and a set that saw him pining for the days of the Nokia 3310 before delivering an extraordinary impersonation of US model and TV host Tyra Banks. The crowd appeared thoroughly enchanted, and he blew them a kiss as he left the stage, safe in the knowledge that an American fanbase now awaits. In many ways, Whitehall gained from the fact that he could easily have been taken for a lost member of Mumford &amp; Sons, who performed three songs immediately before his set and met with the evening's most rapturous reception. If there is a time to be young and British and faintly old-fashioned, it is very possibly now. In the end, the night belonged to Russell Brand, who performed a sort of comic duet with Noel Fielding, and later dandied on stage for his own eight-and-a-half minute routine \u2013 the longest of the night. It was a performance that felt freewheeling, contagious and delightful, with its ruminations on sex, the Daily Mail, and the assertion that popular culture \"functions like a pink pony trotting through our brains shitting glitter\". The night culminated in a short yet joyous set by Coldplay, incorporating lasers, confetti canons and Chris Martin clambering up the balconies like a mountain gazelle. Amid all the fanfare and fluttering paper, it was hard not to conclude that this Ball had been anything other than a roaring success.",

      "bodyText": "The Royal College of Physicians is sending out a survey to all 26,000 members and fellows on whether it should formally reject the NHS bill. The survey is the result of an impassioned and highly unusual EGM of the college last week, during which very strong opposition to the bill was voiced by most of the 189 attendees. Although 89% of those present at the EGM said they believed the reforms would \"damage the NHS and the health of the public in England\", and 79% called on the RCP to demand its withdrawal, those votes were non-binding. The meeting agreed by 80% to 16%, with 4% abstaining, to survey the membership to ensure policy was decided by most of the country's hospital doctors, rather than a small group. The survey goes out with a covering letter in which the college president, Sir Richard Thompson, calls for as many members as possible to take part. \"The RCP urges all fellows and members to record your views on whether the RCP should formally reject the bill, and to indicate how you would like the RCP to proceed,\" he says. \"We would also like you to specify your key concerns regarding the bill and the wider health landscape. Your responses are vital in assisting your council to determine our future strategy. The more feedback we obtain from members and fellows, the stronger our mandate and message will be.\" The medical royal colleges are standard-setting and accrediting bodies, not trade unions. All have been under pressure from their members to take a stand over the bill. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health held a vote that had a poor turnout but a big majority calling for withdrawal. The Faculty of Public Health surveyed its members and three-quarters of the 40% who took part demanded complete withdrawal. The Royal College of Radiologists has opposed the bill, and this week both the Royal College of Surgeons and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists will meet to decide whether to come out against it. The British Medical Association, Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Midwives have been opposed for some time and were not invited to David Cameron's recent summit meeting on the bill.",

Southwest One was set up in 2007 as a joint venture company between the council, Taunton Deane borough council, Avon and Somerset police and IBM to modernise the local authorities' business processes. Ken Maddock, leader of Somerset council, said: \"We have bent over backwards to try to make this partnership work. But we have to state clearly that our primary duty in looking after the public's hard earned money is to make sure we get the best possible deals, that we get the best possible value for the public's money.\" Under an agreement signed this month, Somerset will take back finance advisory functions, plus elements of shared accounting and business development services from Southwest One, but will leave accounts payable and receivable functions within the company. HR advisory, development and learning functions will be transferred back to the council, while recruitment, payroll and HR administration will stay with Southwest One. Pensions services will transfer back to Somerset council. The secondments of 160 council staff to Southwest One will be terminated, and they will revert to council terms and conditions. A risk assessment of the transfer carried out by the council has found that some disruption to services could occur. Somerset is planning \"transition workshops\" to identify and pre-empt problems. Ian Liddell-Grainger, MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset, said he was delighted by Somerset's decision: \"I think this is three or four years overdue. It has cost the council \u00a3500m.\" He added: \"The police should follow suit and as quickly as possible.\" The decision to take the services back in-house follows losses of \u00a331.5m at the joint venture which Maddock described last month as \"staggering\", adding the venture had also shown \"failures to hit modest savings targets\". Southwest One's latest accounts show also it received a \u00a310m loan from IBM, and the company has said that it has now implemented changes designed to \"improve its financial footing\". Southwest One said in a statement: \"We can confirm Somerset county council and Southwest One have concluded discussions regarding HR and finance services as part of the council's response to central government's cuts in local government funding.\" Council cabinet member David Huxtable signed a decision to renegotiate Somerset's contract with Southwest One on 2 March 2012. \"Clearly there are a number of HR risks and issues to deal with, along with a range of change management activities, all of which need to be communicated carefully to the multiple stakeholder groups,\" says the document signed by Huxtable. \"In order to achieve this and minimise disruption, a joint [Somerset county council-Southwest One] HR, change and communications workstream is under way and rapidly completing activities.\" This article is published by Guardian Professional.

Kinnaman had been tipped to take on the role made famous by Peter Weller in Verhoeven's dystopian tale of a Detroit police officer who is returned to duty as a cyborg enforcer following his death in the line of duty. Weller also starred in a poorly received sequel in 1990 but did not return for Robocop 3 in 1993. Kinnaman plays Stephen Holder, partner of homicide detective Sarah Linden in the US version of The Killing. He is also known in Sweden as the star of the critically acclaimed 2010 thriller Easy Money and appeared in six films in the Johan Falk series as Frank Wagner. The actor has joint Swedish-American citizenship through his Swedish mother and US-born father, and made his Hollywood debut in the Timur Bekmambetov alien-invasion film The Darkest Hour last year. He also appeared in Safe House opposite Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, released in the UK last month. The new Robocop film may have special resonance in the UK, as the original film depicts the takeover of the city's police force \u2013 with disastrous consequences \u2013 by a private corporation. The Guardian disclosed last week that the West Midlands and Surrey police authorities have invited private security companies to bid for a wide range of services, including criminal investigations, patrolling neighbourhoods and detaining suspects. Brazilian film-maker Padilha is best known for the two films in his Elite Squad series about a special police unit operating within the drug-ravaged favelas of Rio de Janeiro.",

      "bodyText": "Oke Okaro is global head of mobile at Bloomberg, having joined in 2010 from a similar role at ESPN. His job: to help fulfil the company's stated aim to deliver \"essential news information and tools\" for businesses and financial executives. \"That broad mission is platform-agnostic: we are committed to doing that across every platform, and doing it in a way that is optimal for each platform, including mobile,\" he says. \"Mobile is changing consumer expectations, changing the way people interact with content, and most importantly changing their expectations around that content.\" Since joining Bloomberg, Okaro has worked on the launch of Business Week's iPad app in early 2011, as well as iPad app Bloomberg TV+ and iPhone app Bloomberg Radio+ later that year. One of the interesting features of the latter is the ability to see biographies of radio guests, market data and charts as they are referenced during a show or interview on the screen, while listening. \"It makes sense because it enriches the experience in a way that's very natural,\" says Okaro. \"We are connecting both worlds [radio and app] in a very organic way, and I think quite frankly that in the future this is how radio and television will be consumed.\" Ah, second-screen apps, although Okaro uses the term \"companion experiences\" \u2013 an area he has been exploring since his days at ESPN. He sees great potential in this, particularly if what's happening on the second screen is \"programmed\" to synchronise with what the user is watching or listening to. \"You'll have someone on the air who's using an interactive tool to provide a specific perspective or point, and you'll be able to do this yourself if you have the product,\" he says. \"These tools are going to be transportable across platforms, and the companion screen is going to be a very important screen, if you have programmed a companion experience to complement the show.\" One benefit these apps are having for Bloomberg is to extend the company's reach \u2013 Okaro says that 40% of the people who use the Bloomberg TV+ app are new to the service, rather than existing viewers on other platforms. The company has also been running surveys and digging into the data provided by usage of its apps to gauge what features people are using most, and how this might affect the apps' evolution in the coming months. A key lesson: \"What people really want is greater personal relevance from a content experience: they want the ability to more effectively tailor the experience to meet their specific needs,\" says Okaro. \"With the amount of content that we have on the news, data and tools sides, certain combinations of that make sense with different audiences. One size fits all does not work, especially on smartphones when people want to get to what they care about very quickly and easily.\" Bloomberg is not purely focused on apps when it comes to mobile: its mobile website is thriving. That's due to a deliberate strategy of focusing just as much on mobile web as on native apps, as Okaro explains. \"We think it is essential to have content across every device, and we can do that by having a great mobile website,\" says Oke Okaro, global head of mobile at Bloomberg. \"Then we see a role for apps to give us another point of discovery in terms of being in the app stores, and also to deliver an experience that is slightly richer than you can provide in a mobile website. We think that both will co-exist.\" In fact, they are already. Okaro says that Bloomberg currently sees 7.8m unique users across its mobile products every month, with 3m of those coming from apps. He outlines why the mobile website attracts so much traffic, starting with search. \"Whenever anyone runs a search on a mobile device and taps on a link from Bloomberg.com, it brings them to the mobile website, and whenever someone taps on a link that has been shared on Twitter, we bring up the mobile website,\" he says. \"And, of course, if you go to Bloomberg.com from the browser, you get the mobile website. There are a number of ways people discover content, and the content available in apps is not yet being indexed in the same way as the web is being indexed. You have to have a great mobile web experience.\" When it comes to native apps, Bloomberg prioritises platforms based on their overall scale, and their critical mass among its audience \u2013 in the latter case, that critical mass may be current, or Bloomberg may believe it will happen in the future, and wants to get in early. Over time, Okaro believes that any debate about native apps versus mobile web will fade away, as companies get smarter about targeting both. \"It's all about reaching your audience in whichever way your audience chooses to consume your content,\" he says. \"Over time, the two worlds will coincide. People will end up with about 80% of their app being built in HTML5, and the rest being built in native, which will make going from one platform to the next a much more palatable process.\" That may spell good news for Windows Phone-owning Bloomberg users. Okaro says he is very impressed by Nokia's latest Lumia smartphones, and Microsoft's work on the Windows Phone user interface. \"I like Nokia's hardware, and I think both Nokia and Microsoft are clearly committed to this,\" he says. \"There are some things it doesn't support today, like fast-switching between apps and various other things they'll need to address. But I think it's going to do very well.\"",

      "body": "<p>Oke Okaro is global head of mobile at Bloomberg, having joined in 2010 from a similar role at ESPN. His job: to help fulfil the company's stated aim to deliver \"essential news information and tools\" for businesses and financial executives.</p> <p>\"That broad mission is platform-agnostic: we are committed to doing that across every platform, and doing it in a way that is optimal for each platform, including mobile,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Mobile is changing consumer expectations, changing the way people interact with content, and most importantly changing their expectations around that content.\"</p> <p>Since joining Bloomberg, Okaro has worked on the launch of <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bloomberg-businessweek+/id421216878?mt=8\">Business Week's iPad app</a> in early 2011, as well as iPad app <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bloomberg-tv+/id460459302?mt=8\">Bloomberg TV+</a> and iPhone app <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bloomberg-radio+/id424879834?mt=8\">Bloomberg Radio+</a> later that year.</p> <p>One of the interesting features of the latter is the ability to see biographies of radio guests, market data and charts as they are referenced during a show or interview on the screen, while listening.</p> <p>\"It makes sense because it enriches the experience in a way that's very natural,\" says Okaro. \"We are connecting both worlds [radio and app] in a very organic way, and I think quite frankly that in the future this is how radio and television will be consumed.\"</p> <p>Ah, second-screen apps, although Okaro uses the term \"companion experiences\" \u2013 an area he has been exploring since his days at ESPN. He sees great potential in this, particularly if what's happening on the second screen is \"programmed\" to synchronise with what the user is watching or listening to.</p> <p>\"You'll have someone on the air who's using an interactive tool to provide a specific perspective or point, and you'll be able to do this yourself if you have the product,\" he says.</p> <p>\"These tools are going to be transportable across platforms, and the companion screen is going to be a very important screen, if you have programmed a companion experience to complement the show.\"</p> <p>One benefit these apps are having for Bloomberg is to extend the company's reach \u2013&#xa0;Okaro says that 40% of the people who use the Bloomberg TV+ app are new to the service, rather than existing viewers on other platforms.</p> <p>The company has also been running surveys and digging into the data provided by usage of its apps to gauge what features people are using most, and how this might affect the apps' evolution in the coming months.</p> <p>A key lesson: \"What people really want is greater personal relevance from a content experience: they want the ability to more effectively tailor the experience to meet their specific needs,\" says Okaro.</p> <p>\"With the amount of content that we have on the news, data and tools sides, certain combinations of that make sense with different audiences. One size fits all does not work, especially on smartphones when people want to get to what they care about very quickly and easily.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386889424\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330949630590/bloomberg-radio.jpg\" alt=\"Bloomberg Radio+\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bloomberg Radio+ app shows charts and biographies while people listen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bloomberg is not purely focused on apps when it comes to mobile: its mobile website is thriving. That's due to a deliberate strategy of focusing just as much on mobile web as on native apps, as Okaro explains.</p> <p>\"We think it is essential to have content across every device, and we can do that by having a great mobile website,\" says Oke Okaro, global head of mobile at Bloomberg.</p> <p>\"Then we see a role for apps to give us another point of discovery in terms of being in the app stores, and also to deliver an experience that is slightly richer than you can provide in a mobile website. We think that both will co-exist.\"</p> <p>In fact, they are already. Okaro says that Bloomberg currently sees 7.8m unique users across its mobile products every month, with 3m of those coming from apps.</p> <p>He outlines why the mobile website attracts so much traffic, starting with search. \"Whenever anyone runs a search on a mobile device and taps on a link from Bloomberg.com, it brings them to the mobile website, and whenever someone taps on a link that has been shared on Twitter, we bring up the mobile website,\" he says.</p> <p>\"And, of course, if you go to Bloomberg.com from the browser, you get the mobile website. There are a number of ways people discover content, and the content available in apps is not yet being indexed in the same way as the web is being indexed. You have to have a great mobile web experience.\"</p> <p>When it comes to native apps, Bloomberg prioritises platforms based on their overall scale, and their critical mass among its audience \u2013&#xa0;in the latter case, that critical mass may be current, or Bloomberg may believe it will happen in the future, and wants to get in early.</p> <p>Over time, Okaro believes that any debate about native apps versus mobile web will fade away, as companies get smarter about targeting both. \"It's all about reaching your audience in whichever way your audience chooses to consume your content,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Over time, the two worlds will coincide.

      "bodyText": "It has taken almost 60 years, but a novel that the late Nobel laureate Jos\u00e9 Saramago submitted to a publisher in 1953 has finally been released. Saramago, best known for his 1995 novel Blindness, won the Nobel in 1998 for what judges described as his \"parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony\". But 45 years earlier, when the 31-year-old author sent the manuscript for Claraboya (Skylight) to a Portuguese publisher, he never heard back. Saramago was in his fifties before he broke through as a writer with the publication of Baltasar and Blimunda in 1982, with a 1988 English translation bringing him to an international audience. It took until 1989 for the publisher to get in touch with the author about Claraboya, telling him they had found the manuscript during a move and would like to publish it. But he refused. \"Saramago suffered a great deal because of this snub. He felt that if someone hands you the fruits of their labour, the least you can do is reply,\" his widow Pilar del Rio told press in Madrid as the novel was published. Saramago, who died in 2010 aged 87, did not write another novel for almost 20 years after Claraboya was overlooked, she said, focusing instead on journalism. \"He called it the book that was lost and found in time,\" del Rio said. \"He told us he did not want it published during his lifetime but that those who were left behind after he died could do what they thought best with it. We all knew, I think Saramago as well, that it would be best to publish it.\" Claraboya tells of the inhabitants of an apartment block in Lisbon: the shoemaker Silvestre, Justina and her brutal husband, and the nostalgic Spanish woman Carmen. \"It was a difficult novel for the era. It is a book where the family, which is the pillar of society, is a bit of a nest of vipers. There is rape, lesbian love, abuse. Could Portuguese society handle this in the 50s? I don't think so,\" said del Rio. \"My guess is the publishing house was holding on to it until better times, but at the time nobody thought Salazar's regime would last so long.\" The novel has now been published in Portugal, Spain and Latin America. Saramago's UK publisher Random House said now the novel has been released in Spanish it will consider an English translation. Another previously unpublished early novel by the author, Raised from the Ground, is due this summer in the UK. Written in 1980, the book is the novel in which Saramago \"first found his distinctive voice and style\", said Random House, telling of the lives of the Mau-Tempo (literally, Badweather) family through the first and second world wars. \"Highly political yet full of Saramago's characteristic humour and humanity, this is a novel as full of love as it is of pain,\" said the publisher. \"It is a vivid, moving tribute to the men and women among whom Saramago lived as a child, and a fascinating insight into the early work of this literary giant.\"",

      "bodyText": "There needs to be a word for the prickly, pompous anger of Cardinal Keith O'Brien and I suggest harrumphability. When he compares gay marriage with the reintroduction of slavery he makes the whole of Christian ethics look like some sonorous, rust-riddled wreck plunging towards the seabed, while gouts of foul air escape towards the surface as it all breaks up. So, in a spirit of fairness, I want to see if there is anything to salvage from the wreck. Could there be a Catholic position on gay marriage that didn't look as if it were driven by homophobia? One answer is suggested by Archbishop Vincent Nichols, who runs the Catholic church in England and Wales. He's not, one notes, a cardinal, as archbishops of Westminster usually are, and as O'Brien is. Some people say this is because he had a reputation as a liberal, others that his ambition was too open. In any case, he seems to be riding the waves of secularity rather more gracefully than the ironclad cardinal. Only last week, he gave permission for the \"gay masses\" in Soho to continue for another five years, though naturally it is assumed that no one who goes there could possibly be having sex, or, if they are, could feel good about the practice. He also told me, in our recent interview, that he was \"singing from the same hymn sheet\" as the cardinal. That is possible but though the words are the same, the tune and the arrangements are very different. Nichols went out of his way to mention the similarities between remarried Catholics and gay ones. Neither can really be married, in Catholic teaching. Nor should either group have sex, according to the Vatican. This will come as bad news to prominent Catholics such as Cristina Odone (married to a divorced man) and Clifford Longley (on his second wife). Yet both of these journalists are quite rightly regarded as adornments to the English Catholic church. Admittedly, there is for straight people always the option of having the first marriage annulled, which for some reason gets easier the richer and more powerful you become. This is one of those loopholes that makes the surrounding law look even more unjust. But apart from that, the condition of gay and of remarried Catholics is pretty much the same and the scriptural warrant for rejecting divorce is quite a lot stronger than the evidence for damning all gay people. I think it's pretty clear that the authors of the Bible would have been horrified by gay marriage, but it is nowhere explicitly denounced the way that Jesus denounced divorce. Despite this, the policy of the Catholic church, in England and Wales at least, is the eminently sensible and humane one of doing everything possible to keep divorced and remarried couples as part of their parishes, attending church regularly. It may be that this is driven more by necessity, or horse sense, than humanity: if only Catholics who fully accepted the church's teaching on sex went to churches they would all empty. Nonetheless, the argument from humanity would be widely accepted. In Christian language, remarried couples can be a means of grace to one another. And, if remarried couples can, why can't gay couples, too? This is the question that, I think, convicts O'Brien of something more than old age and pugnacity. Last week, as an experiment, I asked on Twitter whether religious conservatives thought marriage better defended by banning straight divorce or gay marriage. Most of those who responded said the question was unfair and both were wrong. But the three or four people who answered the question honestly all replied \"divorce\". No one is going to make divorce more difficult in the foreseeable future. But even if they were, the argument for remarriage is not just one of harm reduction. It's about increasing the good in the world. Even if we don't consider the needs of children (and I think a loving step-parent is better than none at all, just as an unloving one is worse) a remarried couple can be a source of strength and consolation to one another in a way quite easily distinguished from friendship. What no Catholic can convincingly do is explain why the case must be different for gay people. They know \u2013 we all do \u2013 about remarried couples from experience, if in a rather inarticulate way. But until the Catholic church campaigns against civil marriage for straight people with the same fervour as it campaigns against gay marriage, it's obvious that O'Brien is not just bigoted and wrong, but wrong for all the bigoted wrong reasons. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "Chapter 4 - The Making of the Hockey Stick Although scientific revolutions in how we see the world do occur, the bulk of our scientific understanding comes from the cumulative impact of numerous incremental studies that together paint an increasingly coherent picture of how nature works. The hockey stick was no different. To employ a mixed sports metaphor, the hockey stick did not suddenly appear out of left field. Rather, it arose as a logical consequence of decades of work by paleoclimate researchers that led to increasingly rich networks of climate proxy data, and the introduction of new ways to use such data to reconstruct past climates. My colleagues and I were the beneficiaries of this substantial body of past work. Onto the World Stage When we initially wrote up our results for publication, we focused on what we felt was most scientifically interesting, for example, that we recovered an unusual pattern for the 1816 \"year without a summer\" that indicated a very cold Eurasia and lower than average temperatures in north America (observations that are independently confirmed by historical accounts), but a warmer than usual Middle East and Labrador (who knew?). Or that we had independently affirmed anecdotal accounts that there was a whopper of an El Ni\u00f1o event in 1791 \u2013 a year that, according to our reconstruction, also happened to be a comparative scorcher for Europe and a large part of north America. Then we did the least scientifically interesting thing one could possibly do with these rich spatial patterns: we averaged them to obtain a single number for each year: the northern hemisphere average temperature. That single aspect of our work got all the attention. In truth, it did also represent an advance. Compared to previous northern hemisphere temperature reconstructions, ours went further back, it resolved individual years rather than just decades, and it had error bars associated with it. Thus, we were able to draw the specific conclusion that, even taking into account the margin for error, three recent years \u2013 1990, 1995, and 1997 \u2013 all appeared warmer than any other in the past six centuries. Our study, which has come to be known as \"MBH98\" for the authors \u2013 Mann, Bradley, Hughes \u2013 was published in Nature on April 22, 1998: Earth Day. I was caught completely offguard by the amount of media attention the article received. Generally, one is lucky to get a nibble or two from the local media in response to press releases on a published scientific paper. This time was different. No sooner had the press releases gone out (one from University of Massachusetts, another from Nature, and a third from the National Science Foundation) than the phone calls began coming in non-stop. Our study was written up in the New York Times, USA Today, Boston Globe, and a host of other major US newspapers. Articles soon appeared in Time magazine and US News and World Report. We even made it into Rolling Stone (though not the cover). I was asked in one afternoon to do television interviews with CNN, CBS, and NBC. In the CBS interview, John Roberts put it to me bluntly: \"So does this prove humans are responsible for global warming?\" He repeated the question at least three times during the interview, clearly not having gotten the money quote he was fishing for. I wouldn't take the bait. I repeated that our results were \"highly suggestive\" of that conclusion, but I wouldn't go further than that. I well knew that establishing that recent warming is anomalous in a long-term context alone did not establish that human factors were responsible for it. Any conclusion about causality required the use of climate models to estimate the relative contributions of the various factors, including human increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, hypothesised to be responsible for the observed changes. There are several reasons that our paper might have received more than the usual expected attention. The globe had experienced record-breaking warmth that winter. The first three months of 1998 were the warmest on record (in western Massachusetts, where I was living, it barely felt like we'd had a winter). Temperatures had likely been spiked, to some extent, by a fluke of nature, a particularly large El Ni\u00f1o event. It was in part due to this fluke that the 1998 record for the hottest year in the instrumental record had still not unambiguously been broken by 2011 (one group has 2005 and 2010 \u2013 in a statistical tie \u2013 narrowly beating it out, but another group has 1998 still holding the title). In any case, 1998 was as of that date the warmest year in the instrumental record; with the advent of our study, \"the warmest on record\" meant not just in 150 years but in at least 600. That our paper coincidentally happened to be published on Earth Day no doubt gave journalists an extra news hook to cover the study. Some commentators attached an almost diabolical significance to the timing, as if Nature was somehow conspiring with the world's environmental activists. The truth is much less interesting; the publication date at Nature is determined by the date of a paper's final acceptance and placement in the journal's publication queue. The Implications Though we didn't quite realise it at the time, the gauntlet had been laid down with the initial publication of the extended MBH99 millennial hockey stick and, especially, its subsequent prominence in the 2001 IPCC report. We had taken on a sacred cow of climate change contrarianism: the medieval warm period (MWP). Our reconstruction did not \"eliminate the MWP\", as our detractors liked to claim. It did in fact include a period of relative warmth during the medieval era of the eleventh to fourteenth centuries. While medieval conditions were relatively warm, however, the modern tip of the blade \u2013 as can be seen in the graphic featured in the prologue \u2013 was warmer than the peak reconstructed medieval warmth. One pillar of the contrarian case against human-caused climate change was that the mere existence of a warmer period centuries earlier somehow disproved any human influence on modern warmth. In reality, this was not true. Scientists had known for some time, for example, that there were periods in the deep geological past during which temperatures were warmer than today, such as in the mid-Cretaceous period 100 million years ago. The reason was atmospheric CO2 concentrations that were several times higher than today, owing to the slow geological processes that modify atmospheric composition on very long timescales. It was indeed possible that other natural factors, be they changes in solar output or volcanic activity, could have led to conditions that were as warm as today. Whether conditions in past centuries might have been warmer than today, then, would not have a scientific bearing on the case for the reality of human-caused climate change. That case, as we've seen, rests on multiple independent lines of evidence: the basic physics and chemistry of the greenhouse effect, for example; the relationship between greenhouse gas concentrations and temperatures over geological time; and a pattern of observed climate change that can only be explained by climate models when human-produced greenhouse gases are included in the calculations. While the presence of a medieval warm period warmer than today would not negate the reality of modern human-caused climate change, evidence of its absence nonetheless would take away an important (if misguided) talking point of contrarians \u2013 something of which they were well aware. Our finding that recent warming was anomalous in a long-term (now, apparently, millennial) context was suggestive of the possibility that human activity was implicated in the warming. I was always very careful not to claim that our work could firmly establish a human role in the warming. To draw such a conclusion based on our work alone would necessarily buy into the classic logical fallacy of \"correlation without causation\". We had established correlation \u2013 the anomalous warming that we documented coincided with the human-caused ramp-up in greenhouse gas concentrations \u2013 but we hadn't established causality. A little more than a year after we had published our millennial hockey stick reconstruction, paleoclimatologist Thomas Crowley of Texas A&amp;M University (and coauthor of the Crowley and Lowery reconstruction discussed earlier) published findings based on the use of a theoretical climate model simulation designed to investigate causes of past temperature change. Crowley subjected the model to estimated changes in natural factors over the past thousand years, using indirect measures of changes in solar output and explosive volcanic activity, information on both of which can be recovered from atmospheric deposits in polar ice cores. These simulations revealed that the natural factors could explain the extent of medieval warmth in our reconstruction; in the model, this warmth arose from a relative lack of cooling volcanic eruptions combined with relatively high levels of solar output. The natural factors could also explain the cooler conditions of the ensuing Little Ice Age, which resulted from relatively low levels of solar output and more frequent explosive volcanic eruptions. Fed the natural factors only, the model could not, however, reproduce the abrupt twentieth century warming. In fact, the model predicted that the climate should have cooled in recent decades, rather than warmed, if only natural factors had been at play. It was only when Crowley added the modern human influences \u2013 increasing greenhouse gas concentrations primarily from fossil fuel burning and the regional cooling effect of industrial sulphate aerosols emissions \u2013 to the model simulation, that it was able to track the hockey stick all the way through to the present. The conclusion was clear: Natural factors could explain the temperature changes of the past millennium through the dawn of the industrial revolution, but only human influences could explain the unusual recent warming. Causality was at least tentatively established now.",

      "bodyText": "2pm Your questions, please, for our pre-Festival podcast Will Hayler: With the help of our friends at Timeform Radio, the Guardian racing desk's first ever Cheltenham podcast will be recorded tonight and will hopefully be available for you to listen to at your leisure from tomorrow. Included will be an interview with Donald McCain. If anybody has any questions for D-Mac, or any other issues you'd particularly like us to address, then drop us a comment below and we'll do our best to ask it, mention it or at least try not to ignore it. 12.30pm Kauto Star update Paul Nicholls reports that he has stepped up Kauto Star's work on Monday morning as the horse continues to recover from injuries sustained in a schooling fall at his Somerset stable 10 days ago. \"He had his physio and an hour on the walker, as per usual,\" Nicholls said through his Betfair column. \"And then he had a 10f canter with Five Dream. But, in addition to that, he had a canter up the hill with the same horse.\" Nicholls plans the same routine tomorrow, with the addition of a second canter up the hill. \"He is fine and we are heading in the right direction at the moment.\" It remains the case that a final decision on Kauto Star's participation in next week's Cheltenham Gold Cup will hinge on how he works with Big Buck's in a gallop planned for Saturday morning. Cheltenham Festival stat of the day, by Paul Jones Being a maiden over hurdles entering last season's Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle, What A Charm kept up the 100% record of Fred Winter winners to have been beaten on their first two starts over hurdles. So how much of a coincidence is it that all seven winners failed to win on their first two starts over hurdles but five of the last six winners then won on their final start before the Festival? To help you decide, those stats, by the way, are also remarkably similar to the chasing equivalent race at this meeting, so the inescapable fact of the matter is that 13 of the 14 winners of the novice handicaps at the Festival have now been won by horses that were beaten on their first two starts in their new discipline. Paul Jones is author of the Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Guide Today's best bets, by Chris Cook The ante-post markets on Betfair are not always as liquid as they might be, so this is only a straw in the wind but I sense a certain amount of unease about Burton Port in betting on next week's Cheltenham Gold Cup. Having traded to reasonable amounts at 17-2 and below after his comeback last month, he has drifted steadily to bigger than 10-1 and there is almost nothing left on the lay side this morning. People are bound to be careful about horses who have had leg problems, so this may amount to no more than sensible caution. Still, if you were thinking about backing him, I'd do it with a firm who are offering the 'non-runner, no-bet' concession. I'm thinking that Tony McCoy might have a good day at Hereford, though I'd rather not take the 6-4 about Qaspal (3.15) in the novice chase. A really promising hurdler two years ago, when he won the Imperial Cup, he has had his problems since then and wasn't wholly convincing on a tentative chasing debut under Richard Johnson recently, but I wouldn't bet against a much better showing this time. McCoy will also be on Made In Time (4.45), for whom this is a significant drop back in class after he was seventh in a Cheltenham handicap last time. Of his four other starts over fences, he won two and unseated twice. He's learning all the time and is still fairly treated for a test such as this, so 9-4 is fair enough. Odds of around 7-1 are not quite what I was hoping for when I picked Miss Brownes Fancy (4.15) for the preceding handicap hurdle. Decent on the Flat in Ireland with David Wachman last year, she showed promise on her hurdles debut before being stuffed on two subsequent tries. I should think this filly, trained by Graeme McPherson, will prove well treated in time but it's a moot point whether she will be quite ready to show her best form today. At Lingfield, Gabriel's Lexi (4.00) is also making her handicap debut, stepped up in trip to a mile and a half after being handicapped on three efforts in maidens at around a mile. Trained by Richard Fahey, she's bred to appreciate the extra distance and ran better than the bare results suggest on her two Polytrack starts (her final run being at Southwell). She's 4-1. Tipping competition - a new week Congratulations to JahLion on a sensational Friday, when French Ties (16-1) and Romulus D'Artaix (9-1) helped him to the winning score of +32.75. That was a bit tough on tom1977 (+28.13), who led before the last race, having picked Romulus and Charm School (13-8), as well as fatdeano (+29.50), who also had French Ties. \u3000 This week's prize is two Club enclosure tickets to day one of the Cheltenham Festival, next Tuesday 13th March, kindly offered by OLBG, a sports betting community website, who are sponsoring a race at the Festival for the first time. You will have to be able to provide us with your postal address on Friday evening (in response to our email) and the tickets will be sent so as to arrive on Monday morning. To kick things off, we'd like your tips, please, for these races: 4.00 Lingfield, 4.15 Hereford, 4.45 Hereford. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time, as I have wistfully remarked before, in the Good Old Days before the printed word was faced by the slings and arrows of electronic publishing, the happy crossword editor could say to setters (and solvers) that a word was not legitimate crossword fodder unless it could be found in the latest edition of one of the reputable single-volume dictionaries. (Some editors were prepared to go even further and insist that it had to be in a specified dictionary, often Chambers.) I am not sure that was ever a very good defensive position to adopt. You will find words like floccinaucinihilipilification (which those with a Classical education may recognise as meaning 'setting at little or no value') that should not, in my view, appear in a family crossword, even when they are there in Chambers. On the other hand, there are words or phrases like, iPad or extraordinary rendition, that I think most Guardian solvers would regard as fair game, even if they cannot yet be found in a published dictionary. But, on top of all that, there is a further whole problem area: it is new jargon. For example, the suggestion was made to me earlier this year by LB that 'anagrind' should be accepted as a legitimate word for crossword purposes and that we should start a campaign for it to be so recognised by the editors of the leading English language dictionaries. In case some of you are unfamiliar with the term (now in common usage among crossword setters) it means an anagram indicator. Its etymology is the contraction of ANAGR(am)/IND(icator). My position on this one is still the uncomfortable one of sitting on the fence. I accept that crossword setters and most dedicated crossword groupies recognise the word. But I am not sure that it has passed the critical test (now less clearly definably than it was in the past) of having properly entered into the language. I should much value your thoughts on this and related issues, as the question of when and how a word becomes fair in crosswords becomes daily less easy to answer. _____ There were widespread protests at the start of the year about the effect on the layout of the printed Cryptic and Quick crossword puzzles as a result of the decision to abolish a separate Sports section on four days of the week and to incorporate sport into the main body of the paper. The resultant redesign of the Cryptic so that it lay across the centre fold was quickly put right and it is now always in the bottom part of the inside back page, so that the paper can be folded in four for those who need to solve the puzzle in a confined space. The problem with the Quick was that the type size for the clues had to be greatly reduced to fit the space made available, to the point where they were very hard to read. As I hope Quick aficionados will have seen, the puzzle has been designed again, enabling the type size for the clues to be increased to a more comfortable level. _____ As many of you will have noticed Rufus (Roger Squires) celebrated his 80th birthday on 22 February. The Editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, gave a party in his honour the previous evening at which fulsome tributes were paid to his hugely popular, benevolent and scrupulously fair style of clues. Araucaria had hoped to be there but, in the event could not be, so he sent a poem instead. It was already been published in Alan Connor's blog on the crossword home page. But, for those who did not read it there, here again is the tribute from one master setter to another: Master magician Roger Squires For eighty years has graced the land, And still his mental sleight of hand Perplexes, conjures and inspires. Not his the strained linguistic mires That only nerds can understand; His clues, meticulously planned, Delight us as they cross our wires. So, as we toast our honoured guest, Best wishes, thanks and this behest \u2013 Pray relish and don't rue the fuss We make of you dear Rufus: plus Remember this, young Master Squires: No cruciverbalist retires. _____ The February Genius puzzle (No 104 set by Tramp) proved popular. Tony was first in at 00:56, followed by Dave at 01:03. PSC from Australia was the first foreign entry at 02:34. There were no fewer than 30 correct entries on the first day and 303 in all by the deadline. Congratulations to Sue Salter, who is February's winner. We hope you enjoy our crossword service.

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time, as I have wistfully remarked before, in the Good Old Days before the printed word was faced by the slings and arrows of electronic publishing, the happy crossword editor could say to setters (and solvers) that a word was not legitimate crossword fodder unless it could be found in the latest edition of one of the reputable single-volume dictionaries. (Some editors were prepared to go even further and insist that it had to be in a specified dictionary, often Chambers.) </p> <p>I am not sure that was ever a very good defensive position to adopt. You will find words like floccinaucinihilipilification (which those with a Classical education may recognise as meaning 'setting at little or no value') that should not, in my view, appear in a family crossword, even when they are there in Chambers. On the other hand, there are words or phrases like, iPad or extraordinary rendition, that I think most Guardian solvers would regard as fair game, even if they cannot yet be found in a published dictionary.

      "bodyText": "The Audit Commission has announced the provisional winners of its 10 outsourced regional contracts, promising savings of 'up to 40%' for public bodies. The proposed employee-owned spinout from the Audit Commission, DA Partnership, managed to win only one contract and will now launch as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mazars. It will take on the north east and north Yorkshire contract as Mazars DA. Two of the 'big four' auditors, PwC and Deloitte, have missed out on contracts, while the other two, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG, will share half of the 10 regional contracts. The big winner appears to be Grant Thornton, which has taken a maximum four contracts with a total estimated value of \u00a341.3m. The Audit Commission will retain a small stable of staff to oversee the contracts, but most of its former staff will transfer to the contract winners. Grant Thornton has said it will take on about 300 former staff from the Commission. The transfer of staff to the private sector has been controversial, with 500 staff taking industrial action, including an overtime ban, in the past month, in protest about the government's failure to protect their pensions as part of the transfer deal. Following an improved offer from the Commission last week, members of the Prospect union agreed to end their action, with the union describing the result as a \"reasonable compromise\". The Commission's chief executive, Eugene Sullivan said the awarding of the contracts to the private sector was a \"pivotal point\" in the history of public service. \"We will be losing a distinctive, and publicly-owned, local public audit service and its district auditors who have helped to protect the public purse effectively for over a hundred and fifty years,\" he said. Gareth Davies, the former head of the Audit Commission's practice who led the bid from the DA partnership, said it had not achieved the \"dream of a mutual audit practice\". Davies will join Mazars as head of public services to lead the new venture, along with a team of former Audit Commission advisors led by Mark Fletcher. Proposed contract awards: \u2022 Grant Thornton (UK) LLP, a total notional of \u00a341.3m a year covering four contract areas in the North West, West Midlands, London (South) Surrey &amp; Kent, and South West \u2022 KPMG LLP a total notional value of \u00a323.1m a year covering three contract areas in Humberside &amp; Yorkshire, East Midlands, and London (North) \u2022 Ernst &amp; Young LLP a total notional value of \u00a320m a year covering two contract areas in Eastern and South East \u2022 DA Partnership Ltd a total notional value of \u00a35m a year covering one contract area in the North East &amp; North Yorkshire.",

It will take on the north east and north Yorkshire contract as Mazars DA. </p> <p>Two of the 'big four' auditors, PwC and Deloitte, have missed out on contracts, while the other two, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG, will share half of the 10 regional contracts.</p> <p>The big winner appears to be Grant Thornton, which has taken a maximum four contracts with a total estimated value of \u00a341.3m. </p> <p>The Audit Commission will retain a small stable of staff to oversee the contracts, but most of its former staff will transfer to the contract winners. Grant Thornton has said it will take on about 300 former staff from the Commission.</p> <p>The transfer of staff to the private sector has been controversial, with 500 staff taking industrial action, including an overtime ban, in the past month, in protest about the government's failure to protect their pensions as part of the transfer deal. Following an improved offer from the Commission last week, members of the Prospect union agreed to end their action, with the union describing the result as a \"reasonable compromise\".</p> <p>The Commission's chief executive, Eugene Sullivan said the awarding of the contracts to the private sector was a \"pivotal point\" in the history of public service. \"We will be losing a distinctive, and publicly-owned, local public audit service and its district auditors who have helped to protect the public purse effectively for over a hundred and fifty years,\" he said.</p> <p> Gareth Davies, the former head of the Audit Commission's practice who led the bid from the DA partnership, said it had not achieved the \"dream of a mutual audit practice\". Davies will join Mazars as head of public services to lead the new venture, along with a team of former Audit Commission advisors led by Mark Fletcher.</p> <p> </p> <p>Proposed contract awards:</p> <p>\u2022 Grant Thornton (UK) LLP, a total notional of \u00a341.3m a year covering four contract areas in the North West, West Midlands, London (South) Surrey &amp; Kent, and South West</p> <p>\u2022 KPMG LLP a total notional value of \u00a323.1m a year covering three contract areas in Humberside &amp; Yorkshire, East Midlands, and London (North)</p> <p>\u2022 Ernst &amp; Young LLP a total notional value of \u00a320m a year covering two contract areas in Eastern and South East</p> <p>\u2022 DA Partnership Ltd a total notional value of \u00a35m a year covering one contract area in the North East &amp; North Yorkshire.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Diversity &amp; inclusion can have a number of meanings depending on one's geographic location and experiences. To most, it references topics such as race, gender or religion. At Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, we approach diversity and inclusion from a very broad perspective, recognising that there are 25 different dimensions of diversity that make up who we are. In short, we define diversity and inclusion as follows: Diversity is about who you are as an individual \u2013 what's seen and unseen. It also includes the rich differences between individuals such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, and education. Inclusion is about embracing those differences, and thoughtfully and enthusiastically enabling those differences to equally contribute. Our commitment At Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, which now operates stores in the US, Europe and Asia, we are firmly committed to increasing and utilising the diversity of our associates and management team across the organisation. Those differences are supported by a culture of inclusion, so that we better understand our customers, capitalise on the talents of our workforce and have an inclusive mindset that values every dimension of diversity. Our strategy To ensure that we uphold Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's commitment with diversity and inclusion and to effectively manage this initiative, we have six diversity drivers that make up our diversity and inclusion strategy. These drivers give structure and direction for the initiative at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Much like a soccer team develops a coordinated strategy to score goals; our strategy helps us achieve very specific goals in creating and sustaining a more inclusive environment for our associates and customers. Our six diversity drivers \u2022 Leadership commitment \u2022 Employee engagement \u2022 Measurement and accountability \u2022 Communication \u2022 Training and education \u2022 Policy integration In addition to our six drivers, we also partner and sponsor organisations that align with and compliment our commitment to equality and inclusion. The evidence of our commitment can be seen through our strong partnerships with groups such as The National Society of High School Scholars, which has 700,000 members across 160 countries, and support for sponsorship opportunities such as the European Diversity Awards, and the NYSE Euronext Global Diversity Leadership Exchange (NYX is the first cross-border exchange group created by the combination of the New York Stock Exchange Group and Euronext NV, in 2007). As mentioned above, we are especially pleased and excited about our new relationship with the European Diversity Awards. Its reach and efforts to unite Europe on issues related to such issues a race, culture, sexual orientation, religion and disabilities is unmatched. It has afforded us the unique opportunity to connect with an effort that aligns well with our corporate culture of inclusion and support the dialogue for equality, while we expand our brand throughout Europe. As a founding corporate partner of the event that awards the 'diversity champion of the year' category, our associates and customers were able to see our commitment in action. In fact, one of our European recruiters commented on how \"proud he was to be part of a company that truly invests in this issue\". A statement like this is meaningful and translates into a form of corporate brand equity. Finally, a successful diversity and inclusion program must have the support from the top leadership within the organisation and engagement among its associates. One way we have our top leadership involved is by relying on our Executive Diversity Council (vice president and above from different aspects of the business; HR, allocation, stores, finance, and so on) at our corporate office - with members from both the US and Switzerland, Stores Diversity Council for our store's organisation (with members located across the US, Europe and Asia), and a DC Diversity Council for our distribution centre associates. Simultaneously, we engage our associates through social media and interactive learning modules to help create the connections they need to sustain our efforts. In the words of one associate, \"A&amp;F has made me much more interested in other people, their cultures and has made this world seem a lot smaller knowing that people are much more alike than I ever imagined.\" To learn more about what Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is doing globally, click here.

      "bodyText": "Ahead of his keynote speech at the Changing Media Summit, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Bella, CEO, Piano Media, gives us a snapshot of his hopes and fears for the media industry and his vision for the future of online content. Quick-fire intro: favourite app, hopes and fears for 2012? My favourite apps are Instapaper and Read it Later. Hopes and fears? I hope we will see many new experiments in journalism and digital content, and I fear most of them will not bring results soon enough to be able to save the experimentators. Who in your opinion strikes you as being most innovative in their approach to media? Which business models do you see surviving and which will fall by the wayside? Creators of apps like Flipboard, Pulse or News360 opened the eyes of many publishers about how open people are to new ways of how to read the news and how easy is to break some of their habits. Now it would be great to take some of the innovations from apps also back to the web and think of absolutely new ways how to present content there as well. Besides us it looks like Press+ in the US and their metered system is here to stay. Micro-payments don't really seem to have a future in journalism because people don't see the point in paying per article. Also the voluntary payment system doesn't seem to be gaining much traction, when people are asked to pay voluntarily, they usually don't bother. Can you put a value on journalism? There are really two different types of journalism. There is what's commonly available and there's exclusive content. But all journalism is valuable because it's reported by professionals, edited by professionals and distributed to the public on sites they trust. And besides, in countries which were behind the Iron Curtain, journalism is even more valuable as it does help keep tabs on the government and keeps the electorate informed. That really is invaluable. How is the role of advertising changing as we find a way to pay for media? Advertising is less targeted now than it was in the past. That's why advertisers are less willing to pay for page views, they know they don't have the market reach they had in print. But with less money going around now due to the recession, they are also looking at trying to hit their target audience more effectively and web demographics are certainly helping. Ad rates are never going to get up to what they were prior to the introduction of the internet, but if newspapers stop putting out a print edition, will they need such high rates? That's an interesting question. Does top-down regulation work? Won't consumers always stay one step ahead? Let's look at this another way. What news is actually free? What the wires produce? That's what the news consumer would say. But that's not true. Yahoo pays the AP, the New York Times pays Reuters, Google compensates Bloomberg. So the wires who produce the news are getting paid by the organisations who are putting the information out there for \"free\" on the web. Then you have exclusive content generated by newspapers or magazines. With tablets becoming more and more prevalent (there will be 64 million tablets sold in 2012 added to the 24 million already out there), that's quite a base of people. If a newspaper or magazine designs a great app with an incredible reader experience, then the reader is not going to fight his way around it, what's the point? And sure, there will always be mirror sites up with exclusive content, but the average person is far too busy to spend his time hunting around for the stories. People are creatures of habit and if you can present them a reasonable and simple solution, they'll go for that. Apple proved this with the iTunes model in the early 2000s. Do you see mobile devices shifting attitudes towards paying for media, or will consumers always seek the free option? Mobile devices have proved that people are willing to pay for digital content if the form and medium or, if you want, packaging is right. The problem is to find the a form and packaging for web, where we first need to break \"free\" habits of people that were forming for many years. It will be harder and it will take longer then it took for example with tablets, but I think more and more publishers will already this year start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. How do you view the relationship between media and technology as a whole? Are media companies now having to admit that they're in the tech business too? Whatever they do, 99% of them will always be technologically behind companies and startups that are \"tech\" in their nature and I am not sure if it is a good thing if they keep trying to focus on matching them in this field, since it inevitably means focusing less on the actual content. In many markets there now thousands of companies that can create an iPad App, but only tens or hundreds that can actually produce something that is worth reading inside those apps. Although close integration of editorial people with software development is very important, I think publishers will soon get much better in learning how to use technology to their advantage. With content they actually control, which is the most scarce part of the chain, they will get more experienced in picking the right partners allowing them to focus on what they do best: journalism. What can we expect from Piano Media in the next 12 months? We're launching in two or three more countries and aim to prove that the \"national paid content system\" works much better than individual subscription systems. And not only in small, but also bigger countries. And finally, what's your message to the media industry at the Changing Media Summit? Few years from now, people will look at our times as the age when unbelievably lot of interesting things were happening and when an individual editor, programmer or publishers could easily influence and change the course of media history. So despite all the pain, we ought to enjoy it now.

      "body": "<p>Ahead of his keynote speech at the Changing Media Summit, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Bella, CEO, Piano Media, gives us a snapshot of his hopes and fears for the media industry and his vision for the future of online content.</p> <h2>Quick-fire intro: favourite app, hopes and fears for 2012?</h2> <p>My favourite apps are<strong> </strong>Instapaper and Read it Later.</p> <p>Hopes and fears? I hope we will see many new experiments in journalism and digital content, and I fear most of them will not bring results soon enough to be able to save the experimentators.</p> <h2>Who in your opinion strikes you as being most innovative in their approach to media? Which business models do you see surviving and which will fall by the wayside?</h2> <p>Creators of apps like Flipboard, Pulse or News360 opened the eyes of many publishers about how open people are to new ways of how to read the news and how easy is to break some of their habits. Now it would be great to take some of the innovations from apps also back to the web and think of absolutely new ways how to present content there as well.</p> <p>Besides us it looks like <a href=\"http://www.mypressplus.com/\" title=\"\">Press+</a> in the US and their metered system is here to stay. Micro-payments don't really seem to have a future in journalism because people don't see the point in paying per article. Also the voluntary payment system doesn't seem to be gaining much traction, when people are asked to pay voluntarily, they usually don't bother.</p> <h2>Can you put a value on journalism?</h2> <p>There are really two different types of journalism. There is what's commonly available and there's exclusive content. But all journalism is valuable because it's reported by professionals, edited by professionals and distributed to the public on sites they trust. And besides, in countries which were behind the Iron Curtain, journalism is even more valuable as it does help keep tabs on the government and keeps the electorate informed. That really is invaluable.</p> <h2>How is the role of advertising changing as we find a way to pay for media?</h2> <p>Advertising is less targeted now than it was in the past. That's why advertisers are less willing to pay for page views, they know they don't have the market reach they had in print. But with less money going around now due to the recession, they are also looking at trying to hit their target audience more effectively and web demographics are certainly helping. Ad rates are never going to get up to what they were prior to the introduction of the internet, but if newspapers stop putting out a print edition, will they need such high rates? That's an interesting question.</p> <h2>Does top-down regulation work? Won't consumers always stay one step ahead?</h2> <p>Let's look at this another way. What news is actually free? What the wires produce? That's what the news consumer would say. But that's not true. Yahoo pays the AP, the New York Times pays Reuters, Google compensates Bloomberg. So the wires who produce the news are getting paid by the organisations who are putting the information out there for \"free\" on the web. Then you have exclusive content generated by newspapers or magazines. With tablets becoming more and more prevalent (there will be 64 million tablets sold in 2012 added to the 24 million already out there), that's quite a base of people. If a newspaper or magazine designs a great app with an incredible reader experience, then the reader is not going to fight his way around it, what's the point? And sure, there will always be mirror sites up with exclusive content, but the average person is far too busy to spend his time hunting around for the stories.</p> <p>People are creatures of habit and if you can present them a reasonable and simple solution, they'll go for that. Apple proved this with the iTunes model in the early 2000s.</p> <h2>Do you see mobile devices shifting attitudes towards paying for media, or will consumers always seek the free option?</h2> <p>Mobile devices have proved that people are willing to pay for digital content if the form and medium or, if you want, packaging is right. The problem is to find the a form and packaging for web, where we first need to break \"free\" habits of people that were forming for many years. It will be harder and it will take longer then it took for example with tablets, but I think more and more publishers will already this year start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p> <h2>How do you view the relationship between media and technology as a whole? Are media companies now having to admit that they're in the tech business too?</h2> <p>Whatever they do, 99% of them will always be technologically behind companies and startups that are \"tech\" in their nature and I am not sure if it is a good thing if they keep trying to focus on matching them in this field, since it inevitably means focusing less on the actual content.</p> <p>In many markets there now thousands of companies that can create an iPad App, but only tens or hundreds that can actually produce something that is worth reading inside those apps.</p> <p>Although close integration of editorial people with software development is very important, I think publishers will soon get much better in learning how to use technology to their advantage. With content they actually control, which is the most scarce part of the chain, they will get more experienced in picking the right partners allowing them to focus on what they do best: journalism.</p> <h2>What can we expect from Piano Media in the next 12 months?</h2> <p>We're launching in two or three more countries and aim to prove that the \"national paid content system\" works much better than individual subscription systems. And not only in small, but also bigger countries.</p> <h2>And finally, what's your message to the media industry at the Changing Media Summit?</h2> <p>Few years from now, people will look at our times as the age when unbelievably lot of interesting things were happening and when an individual editor, programmer or publishers could easily influence and change the course of media history. So despite all the pain, we ought to enjoy it now.</p> <p><em>Tom\u00e1\u0161 Bella speaks at the </em><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/changingmediasummit\" title=\"\"><em>MediaGuardian Changing Media Summit</em></a><em>, which takes place 21 &amp; 22 March 2012 \u2013 visit the website to find out more and to book your place.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

      "bodyText": "Bill Patrizio is chief executive of Red Bee Media. Speaking ahead of his appearance at the MediaGuardian Changing Media Summit, Bill tells us his hopes and fears for 2012 and talks about industry revenues and business models in 2020 aswell as future consumption habits and the ability of the media to cater for demand for content on the move. Quick-fire intro \u2013 favourite app, hopes and fears for 2012? I'd say I have two favourite apps \u2013 the first is WhatsApp because without it I'd likely never be able to communicate with my daughter at university in the U.S., and second The Walking Dead Companion App because it's a great show made better by a brilliant app (and maybe because we created and technically delivered it!) Hopes \u2013 an upturn in the UK and EU economies. Fears \u2013 a contagion spreading beyond Greece across southern Europe. Looking forward to 2020 and the reports you're producing on the future of content consumption \u2013 which media trends excite you the most, and how might rich media experiences have evolved by that time? We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of our industry and what it will look like in 2020. And unfortunately, nobody can accurately predict what changes lie ahead and what impact they will have. For example, five years ago, how many people would have predicted the launch of tablet devices or imagined the dramatic impact they've had on consumer experiences in just two years? If we look ahead at what's happening in the more immediate future, it's the impact of convergence that really excites me and how technology is irreversibly changing the way consumers interact and engage with media. For example, the opportunities afforded to the industry and consumers alike by multiple screens; personalization; greater interactivity with developments such as voice and gesture control; not to mention the innovation that continues to emerge from the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook and other new entrants that we have not yet imagined. Also the growth opportunities for small entrepreneurial firms like Red Bee Media are tremendous since the market characteristics for this converged world are very unpredictable and malleable. What's the key to content discovery given the abundance of choice consumers have today? As human beings, we all love choice and we all want to be in control. But in reality, we need some help to cut through the clutter and manage the abundance of choice. The key to successful content discovery is to provide consumers with a level of smart curation. By that I mean providing consumers with the choice they want and demand alongside the illusion of control \u2013 when in actual fact, it's technology that's working behind the scenes and doing the hard work. It's still the lean-back experience, but it's \"lean-back 2.0\". I think that the evolution of the EPG will play a critical part in delivering smart curation: a sense of choice and control through the user interface and a social and personalized experience driven by technology. The EPG certainly won't disappear; rather, it will transform as a result of convergence. The ability to search for content in a simple and intuitive way will also become seamlessly woven into the TV experience. How well do you expect networks to cope with the swell in demand for streamed content on devices? I suspect the networks will struggle until such a time that we conclude that net neutrality is not in the best interests of progress and the free market determines the winners and losers of providing this critical infrastructure. Imagine a country where roads were limited to dual carriageways without motorways. The internet has become an absolutely vital aspect of economic growth and prosperity and impacts daily life for virtually every person on the planet. It is no longer an interesting science experiment used by the 'world wide web' application to distribute text documents. The network is now such a critical part of our infrastructure and our daily lives \u2013 be that for entertainment, education or e-commerce \u2013 and as such, we have to wake up and dispense with the original ideals of the internet in order for us to achieve real progress. Does convergence fragment or consolidate the ways in which we pay for media? When you look at the success of the freemium business model in social gaming, and for example the Newstand subscriptions on iPad, is it possible to cross pollinate these principles around different types of media? I don't think that convergence will change the way in which we pay for media. I believe we will still continue to pay for content through transactional, subscription or advertising models although the method of payment may differ depending on the type of content \u2013 whether it's TV, film, books, games or music and whether it's catalogue or new/live. However, what convergence will bring about is the opportunity for companies to explore and bring to market new and different business models and the opportunity for consumers to access media through many more channels. And finally, what's your message to the industry at the Changing Media Summit? It is a fascinating time. We are debating dramatic changes that will impact the way we live and the way we behave. But it is not a time for the faint of heart. There are risks and challenges to overcome and new entrants who are disrupting the traditional model \u2013 and this is extremely unsettling. That said, I would not want to be in any other situation. For the brave, astute, courageous and agile, there is a huge opportunity for growth and to make a difference. By this, I mean more than just making money; the industry is going through a transformation that will impact society and human lives in the future and this is incredibly exciting.

The media regulator received 108 complaints about Cocozza shouting \"fucking get in there\" before the 9pm watershed when he survived a public vote to stay in ITV1's The X Factor on 23 October. Channel TV, the ITV company which handles programme compliance for the hit ITV1 show, said that it deeply regretted Cocozza's unexpected and unprompted outburst. The company said that a review of the footage showed it was barely audible above the studio furore but is just about discernable in a quieter domestic setting. Channel TV said that the noise levels at the live show meant that members of staff in the main production gallery and sound gallery listening to the ITV1 transmission failed to hear the swearing. As a result no apology was made until 44 minutes later during follow up show The Xtra Factor on ITV2. The regulator said that the outburst broke rules that ban swearing before 9pm, adding that it was particularly concerned at the lax controls governing the show. \"Ofcom was particularly concerned that a high profile live programme such as this did not already have adequate systems in place to monitor the transmission output of the programme as it was broadcast,\" it said. \"We considered that in this instance the offensive term was clearly audible to viewers.

The company said that it has now put in place extra compliance measures such as re-briefing contestants and judges about minding their language, and will make sure one staff member is watching a transmission of the show in a quiet environment. \"Ofcom, however, considered that these measures demonstrated no more than the standard compliance arrangements expected of a licensee broadcasting a live family entertainment programme before the watershed,\" the regulator said. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "Dunelm, the homewares retailer, has fallen sharply after news that former chief executive Will Adderley is cashing in around \u00a325m worth of shares in the business. Adderley, the son of the company's founder who remains executive deputy chairman, and his wife plan to sell around 5m shares in a placing managed by UBS. The shares represent around 2.5% of Dunelm's share capital. Adderley told the company the move was to diversify his share portfolio, and he agreed not to sell more shares for at least six months. His remaining stake gives him around 32.4% of the company, while the Adderley family in total retain 56.2%. The news has sent Dunelm shares down 28.5p to 480p, a 5.6% drop which makes it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250. Analyst Nick Bubb said: Will Adderley, who stepped back from day-to-day involvement in the business when Nick Wharton was brought in from Halfords to take over as chief executive, is to sell 5m more shares as part of a \"portfolio diversification\". Given the recent strength of the share price and the outlook for the UK economy, cynics will think that the real reason is rather different, but, to be fair, the Dunelm business model, of selling cheap cushions and curtains to the mass market, is highly profitable and given the store roll-out potential there should be plenty of takers for the placing. A month ago the company reported a near 8% rise in half year profits to \u00a352m, and Panmure Gordon said: As management near the end of their interim results roadshow, we would presume that the bookrunners will have in principle placed the shares already. Our view on the stock is unchanged as a result of this news, and we reiterate our buy recommendation and 600p price target. Update 11.55 Dunhelm has just announced Adderley and his wife have in fact sold 7.5m worth of shares at 480p each, raising \u00a336m between them. This leaves Adderley with a 31.2% stake in the business.",

      "bodyText": "After Sean Penn and Roger Waters, Morrissey has become the latest Anglophone celebrity to out himself as a malvinista: last Thursday, the former Smiths frontman added his voice to the fast-growing choir of Argentinian claims over the Falklands. The details of this unlikely trio's take on geopolitics are less intriguing than the question of why, in a world sadly full of worthwhile causes, they felt the need to weigh in on the Malvinas of all issues. Concerts or visits in Buenos Aires and a visceral, if not unjustified, dislike of British imperialism and nationalism probably go a long way in the search for an answer. But the question should be put more broadly: how can a few islands kindle a tenacious conflict between two major countries, which otherwise entertain fairly unflustered relations? As the Falklands/Malvinas wrangle testifies, it is the way of irredentists to blow the importance of small chunks of geography out of all proportion. It could be, however, that the conflict persists so stubbornly not in spite of, but because of the Falklands' inconsequentiality. Although quarrels over natural resources have added fuel to the dispute in recent years, oil is not the heart of the matter. The controversy predates any such concerns by several decades. In the case of the Falklands' nearest equivalent on the world map, the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, disagreements between France and Canada over the exploitation of resources could be settled without much travail. The key difference is that Canada, in contrast to Argentina, never lodged a straightforward claim of sovereignty, leaving the door open to negotiations. Argentinian nationalism and domestic politics are no doubt a driving force in keeping the conflict alive. This does not mean that pointing to flaws in the British argument is iniquitous. The most serious one is that 3,000 people, about half of them not even born in the Falklands, barely add up to a solid case for national self-determination. Surely, if there was political will, they could be accommodated under Argentinian sovereignty, where they would join roughly 8,600 British citizens and an estimated 100,000 descendants of British immigrants who today live in mainland Argentina. The alternative of moving them to Britain does not seem overly complicated either. The problem is that \u2013 in contrast to, say, India or Australia \u2013 on small virtually insignificant ocean islands the issue of self-determination has never been very pressing. That is why so many of them are still colonial domains today. It also means that objections to the British stance habitually meet with nothing more imaginative than an obdurate counter-question: why should we leave? It's true that the background theme of anti-colonialism rings hollow, too, for much the same reason. The most persuasive argument against colonialism, namely that it oppresses and exploits people, does not apply to the Falklands. Stripped of its anti-colonial rhetoric, the core of the Argentinian claim is that by the time of the declaration of independence in 1816 the islands belonged to Spain and were consequently transferred to Argentina. This line of reasoning is not much more conclusive. The British could retort that they were there long before 1816. Since no one bothered much at the time, the details of the Falklands' history before 1833 will always remain open to interpretation. If the Argentinian logic were applied more generally it would require redrawing the whole world's political map, a dream come true for nerdy historians. Closer to Buenos Aires, it might just as well serve as a basis for soliciting the \"return\" of Uruguay to Argentina. This sounds outlandish only because historically there have been weighty reasons for Argentina to accept Uruguay's independence of 1828. In the case of the Falklands, their unimportance meant that giving up on Malvinas irredentism never promised to yield enough benefits to compensate for the loss of a firmly held conviction as well as a potentially handy tool in domestic politics. The very nature of the Argentinians' interpretation obliges them to state plainly that the islands always belonged to Argentina and are illegally occupied by Britain. As a group of Argentinian intellectuals has recently pointed out, this premise is contradictory in that it forecloses any negotiation over sovereignty \u2013 which is, however, exactly what the Argentinian government says it wants. One cannot help but feel that in presenting this catch-22, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner is speaking to her own people. So is David Cameron. If the real Falklands, rather than the symbol, truly mattered, a solution would have been found long ago. The crux is that nationalist symbols matter so much.",

Ian has burst into song to celebrate National Pie Week which is naturally very big in the north, which leads the pie world by some margin, albeit with Well Tried certificates for places such as Melton Mowbray and Cornwall. NPW is this week, and in few places does it have more resonance than Denby Dale, the Pennine village with a tradition of baking unfeasibly large pies. This dates back to 1788 when they loyally baked a pie to celebrate King George III's recovery from insanity. Luckily he wasn't around in 1887 when they didn't cook the meat right through and the whole vast mess was buried at Toby Spout. He would have gone mad again. Another low point in the Great Pie tradition was much more recent, when the small but high quality Denby Dale Pie company housed under the echt northern railway viaduct went into receivership. It was then rescued, along with its 17 jobs, by food entrepreneur Andrew Hayes, and this helped prompt Ian's poem, as well as the sheer niceness of pies. Here it is. If Yorkshire's many other laureates such as Simon Armitage and Ian Duhig would like to send us a pie poem, we'd be thrilled. Or send one yourself, in the style of late great YLs such as Philip Larkin or Vernon Scannell. DENBY DALE PIEM It's pleasing to the nose And delightful to the eye Wait till you taste that Denby Dale pie! It's a symphony of crust, Taties, gravy and meat A Denby Dale pie makes your life complete! They've been making pies in Denby Dale For centuries and more They're as Yorkshire as puddings and good strong ale You can smell 'em through the cottage door! They've been eating pies in Denby Dale Since King George was a youth! Each massive pie could tell a tale or a slice of historical truth! They're making them again And the pie-maker's art Is once more close to this town's heart! So all those in favour Stand and bellow Aye! Then have a taste of that there Denby Dale Pie! If you feel the need to have Ian's warmly enjoyable tones reciting this 'piem', then here they are on YouTube. My biography for him says that he is the 22nd most powerful person in radio and that cats make him sneeze, so I pass that on. Denby Dale Pies (small ones, not the monsters) can be bought at Yorkshire stores of the Co-Op, Morrisons, Asda, Tesco and Sainsburys, and at all Booths stores. There's a very entertaining website called The Denby Dale Pie Consiracy, all about how the most recent Big Pie may never have existed...",

      "bodyText": "You could hardly blame Edy Reja for trying to resign. The Rome derby was still 11 days away when Lazio's manager handed in his notice on 22 February, only to have it rejected by the owner Claudio Lotito, but it is a safe bet that this fixture was already on his mind. Reja has noted that his anxiety before games against Roma is such that he is lucky to get even a few hours' sleep. When you've lost to these opponents as often as he has, sweet dreams are hard to come by. Over the course of his 33-year managerial career, Reja had taken charge of 14 matches against Roma; losing 11 and drawing a further two. Since being appointed by Lazio in 2010 the record was played five, lost four. The most recent meeting, admittedly, had been the only exception to the rule \u2013 Miroslav Klose's late goal giving Lazio a 2-1 victory last October. But that might only have served to reinforce the sense that now was the time to get out on a high note. It was not just Reja's personal history that made Sunday's match look daunting for Lazio, either. They were missing eight players through injury or suspension but perhaps more significant still was that this was officially a home game for Roma \u2013 meaning that the lion's share of a near-capacity crowd at the Stadio Olimpico would be pulling for the Giallorossi. Lazio had not won while playing as the away side in the derby since a Coppa Italia game under Sven-Goran Eriksson back in January 1998. Lazio had more to lose than usual this time, too, entering the game level with Udinese in third place and with their stated goal of reaching the Champions League for the first time since 2007 looking more achievable by the week. With Roma seven points further back, this was an opportunity to effectively knock a direct rival out of the running. On the other hand, defeat had the potential to do the opposite. Reja's team had received a significant leg-up on the way to victory in the first meeting this season when the Roma defender Simon Kjaer was sent off while giving away the penalty that would lead to Lazio's equaliser. On Sunday the equivalent moment arrived after just eight minutes \u2013 Roma's goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg this time receiving his marching orders after bringing down Klose when through on goal. By the letter of the law it was the right decision, the goalkeeper having denied Klose a clear goalscoring opportunity, but that would not prevent the rule itself from being debated at length. \"God save us from the International [Football Association] Board,\" wrote Ruggiero Palombo in Gazzetta dello Sport \u2013 lambasting the body for failing to modify the rules so that a yellow card would be deemed sufficient when a penalty is also being given. Reja himself would later say that to his mind a booking would have been sufficient. Hernanes converted the penalty \u2013 just as he had in the first meeting \u2013 but it was not to be plain sailing for Lazio from there. Less than 10 minutes later Roma were level, the officials getting another big call right when the linesman Cristiano Copelli spotted that Fabio Borini's close-range shot had crossed the goalline before being headed clear by Giuseppe Biava. After Sulley Muntari's ghost goal against Juventus and Ifab's announcement that it will trial goalline technology, it was a small but welcome reminder of the good job that most officials are doing. For the remainder of the first half and into the second, Roma would proceed to confound Lazio with their work rate \u2013 finishing with a greater share of possession despite being a man down. But with their manager Luis Enrique having withdrawn Erik Lamela \u2013 on the player's 20th birthday, no less \u2013 for the substitute goalkeeper Bogdan Lobont after Stekelenburg's red card, the team were shorn of a key creative outlet. Rarely did they threaten to shoot, let alone go in front. Instead, a quarter of an hour into the second half it was Lazio who restored their advantage, Stefano Mauri applying a poacher's finish to a Cristian Ledesma free-kick swung over from the right. It has been a frustrating campaign for Mauri, playing just his third league game since the last derby \u2013 having spent four months out after tearing a thigh muscle. His rehabilitation programme, though, was conducted by Filippo Inzaghi's physiotherapist, Giorgio Gasparini; on this evidence one would have to wonder whether he hasn't been offering advice on more than just recovering fitness. This time the advantage would hold, Francesco Totti heading Roma's best opportunity wide, while Hernanes perhaps ought to have added a further goal for Lazio. At full-time Lazio's players would run to celebrate before their fans in the Curva Nord. Then, a minute or two after disappearing down into the tunnel, they re-emerged \u2013 this time bringing Reja with them \u2013 to do it all over again. \"Now I hope to have at least a couple of months' peace,\" said Reja, though as usual that will be in great part up to him. The manager's attempted resignation last month \u2013 seemingly prompted by his frustration at directorial interference in his work \u2013 was not his first near departure this season. The possibility of him walking away was first raised in September after he grew tired of the abuse he was getting from a section of the Lazio support. The separation came rather closer to materialising this time around, however, with Lotito going so far as to approach Gianfranco Zola over the manager's position \u2013 only for Reja to change his mind after a clear-the-air talk with the owner. A strong suspicion remains that this arrangement can only last till the end of the season, when Zola could still take charge, though both the manager and Lotito may find it rather harder to split should this team achieve their Champions League ambitions. The one black mark on the day for Lazio was the behaviour of a section of their fans, who racially abused Roma's Juan during the game. The referee Mauro Bergonzi was forced to warn Mauri, Lazio's captain, that the game would be suspended if the chants continued and his attempts to convey that message to the supporters in question were accompanied by a statement over the public address. That it should come to this was especially disappointing when both teams had presented a joint anti-racism initiative during the week, and had sent out their players before kick-off on Sunday wearing shirts proclaiming their unity against such prejudice. Juan handled himself with dignity, reacting only by turning to the fans and pressing his finger to his lips in a 'shush' gesture, before noting at the end that \"this has never happened to me before in Rome\". Conversely, his manager Enrique was left to reflect on a defeat that felt all too familiar. \"I don't know what I did to deserve this shit,\" he said at full-time. \"I would like to play one derby with 11 men.\" Lazio, too, had finished this game a man short \u2013 but Lionel Scaloni's red card came too late to make a real difference. This was the manager's 10th league defeat with Roma this season, and one which certainly does leave Champions League football looking like a distant dream for his team. Enrique said his team would continue to fight for every point and that he felt he had done enough by now to deserve at least the rest of the season. \"I wouldn't want to be the manager of a club if I'm not wanted by the club or the fans,\" said Enrique \u2013 a position he has maintained from the day he arrived in Rome. For now the club are still behind him, but after consecutive derby defeats, one or two supporters are not quite so sure. Talking points \u2022 At one point on Sunday night it appeared that Claudio Ranieri could be set to lose his job at Inter on the same weekend that his former employers Chelsea had ditched their sixth manager since the Tinkerman. Down 2-0 at home to Catania and past the midway point of the second half, Inter were staring at a sixth straight defeat, having failed to score in 542 minutes of football. Then Diego Forl\u00e1n cut in from the left, arrowing in a low shot that \u2013 with some help from the goalkeeper Juan Pablo Carrizo \u2013 squirmed in at the near post. Ten minutes later Diego Milito popped up with an equaliser. If it was hardly a result to shout about then it was at least a step in the right direction for Inter given the extent of their recent travails. Catania \u2013 exceeding all expectations this season under Vincenzo Montella \u2013 had played well, but it felt indicative of Inter's inability to catch a break lately that the visitors' second goal should arrive with an assist from the noticeably offside Giovanni Marchese. There is little sense that Ranieri has found the solutions he is looking for in terms of tactics or selection \u2013 the late fightback appearing more as the result of desperation than design. But it was not the manager but the owner who has been drawing the worst of the fans' ire. A giant series of banners put on show by the home support read: \"We asked where the strong man of this club was \u2026 nothing. We asked for clarity \u2026 nothing. Conclusions? Dear president, there can only be two: absence or incompetence.\" \u2022 Filippo the nine-year-old showed up with another banner, incidentally, but I'm not going to tell you about that one as the child has had quite enough publicity already. \u2022 Unfortunately Inter-Catania wasn't the only game to feature a crucial missed offside call. Napoli had already been fortunate to avoid conceding a penalty in their game against Parma when Andrea Dossena appeared to handle in the box, but at 1-1 they benefited from an even more clearly mistaken piece of officiating when the flag stayed down for Ezequiel Lavezzi's winner \u2013 for which the Argentinian had begun his run from some way behind the last man. \u2022 While Inter suffer, Milan rejoice at the return of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who marked his return from suspension with a 14-minute hat-trick as the Rossoneri ran riot at Palermo \u2013 a team whom they had not beaten away from home in five attempts. It was only the second of the Swede's career in Italy, the last coming when he was with Juventus back in 2005. His record of 18 goals in 20 Serie A games this season represents the best scoring rate of his career. \"My regret is not having been able to see him at the end of the game against Napoli and during the one against Juventus,\" said Galliani, refusing even now to let the player's ban for slapping Salvatore Aronica lie. The manager Massimiliano Allegri looked on the bright side, saying: \"The break did [Ibra] good.\" \u2022 What will have raised Allegri's spirits even further is seeing Juventus held at home by Chievo later on Saturday evening. Boukary Dram\u00e9's late equaliser for the visitors probably ought to have been cleared off the line by Leonardo Bonucci, but the off-balance defender could only succeed in diverting the ball into the opposite corner of his own net. Suggestions that Juve lack the sort of individual talents to kill off games such as these are nothing new, but on a weekend such as this they become ever harder to dismiss. Three points behind Milan, they can still go level (and effectively ahead, as they hold the tie-breaker) with a win in their game in hand against Bologna, but the momentum increasingly appears to lie with the Rossoneri. Results: Bologna 1-0 Novara, Fiorentina 2-0 Cesena, Inter 2-0 Catania, Juventus 1-1 Chievo, Lecce 2-2 Genoa, Palermo 0-4 Milan, Parma 1-2 Napoli, Roma 1-2 Lazio, Siena 3-0 Cagliari, Udinese 0-0 Atalanta. \u2022 Latest Serie A standings \u2022 Watch the latest Serie A highlights",

One vision involved the Raspberry Pi computer which you may have heard people getting excited about. It's a small, cheap device intended to help teach programming and it's cheap in part because it runs on Linux, a free Unix-like operating system, which means that schools which use the Pi will get to keep money they might otherwise have spent on commercial software. The other vision was seen by some as a chilling Stalinist cacotopia, but only by those who saw anything the least eerie in Rupert Murdoch's innocent-sounding Education Division telling Michael Gove of its unsinister plans to build British schools and kit them out with innocuous News-Corp-issue tablet devices. Think Unix-like systems for the first, Murdoch/Microsoft for the second. And consider your choice carefully. Another Unix-like system, GNU, gives us this week's cluing competition. Acknowledging that it is Unix-like and not actually Unix, \"GNU\" stands for \"GNU's not Unix\". If you have a moment to spare, you can enjoy expanding the acronym for as long as your patience holds: \"GNU's not Unix\"'s not Unix; \"'GNU's not Unix\"'s not Unix''s not Unix, and so on. Such recursive acronyms are the elegant cousins of redundant acronyms. Clumsy and awkward, phrases like \"pin number\" perhaps attract more odium than they deserve; it's never really polite or necessary to butt in with \"Oh, do you mean 'pin number number'? Do you also refer to an 'ATM machine'?\". Guardian house style allows \"pin number\", perhaps appreciating that it's unambiguous in a way that the word \"pin\" isn't. There's a gawky charm in phrases like \"LCD display\", \"DC Comics\" and \"RPG games\".

      "bodyText": "Luis Su\u00e1rez is this season's most talked about player, yet so little talk has been about his football. Su\u00e1rez is a fascinating player because he has an unusual style of play \u2013 it's difficult to think of another player, past or present, to liken him to. He's a small, quick dribbler who enjoys roaming the pitch laterally, yet was also a brilliant poacher in his Ajax days. The first half of that description holds true for his 14 months at Liverpool, but he is yet to prove he has the finishing ability of old. That is crucial, considering Liverpool have the worst shot conversion rate in the league, at 9%, and have scored as few goals as Wolves, in the relegation zone. Su\u00e1rez's goal return this season is, in isolation, extremely disappointing. He's scored six goals from 21 appearances, a similar record to West Brom's Shane Long, and worse than Norwich's Steve Morison or Bolton's Ivan Klasnic. It's hardly unprecedented for a striker to arrive from the Eredivisie and be significantly less prolific in the Premier League, but Su\u00e1rez is clearly no Afonso Alves or Mateja Kezman \u2013 he's not overawed by the league, he's not playing badly, he's just not scoring enough. Six goals doesn't look much better when you consider that Su\u00e1rez has 4.2 shots per game \u2013 only Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have more, and they've scored 18 and 25 goals respectively. But shots per game is a statistic open to interpretation and debate, and Su\u00e1rez epitomises the uncertainly with which it should be viewed. Players with a high shots per game rate are generally exceptional performers \u2013 from Europe's top five leagues, first and second by that measure are Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. The main thing this says is that they're constant threat, which is something Su\u00e1rez \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 also offers. Glenn Hoddle once said that Andy Cole needed six or seven chances to score one goal, which was an extremely harsh reflection on an excellent striker, especially as the criticism stuck with Cole for the rest of his career. But if, for a second, we take Hoddle's view as gospel (which is always a slightly dangerous game), was Cole's problem that he needed six or seven chances? Or that he needed six or seven chances that had been created by others? Cole wasn't simply a finisher, but he was predominantly a penalty box player. The apparent wastefulness was more obvious when it came at the end of a swerving David Beckham cross, from a lofted Paul Scholes pass or following a surging Ryan Giggs dribble. It looked as if he was letting the side down, ruining someone else's good work. Su\u00e1rez is completely different. If Cole's need for six or seven chances was worthy of criticism, Su\u00e1rez's record of scoring a goal every 14.8 shots is truly terrible (with the caveat that a \"shot\" is not quite the same as a \"chance\"). If he were a pure poacher, that ratio would be worthy of a place on the bench. Yet a decent proportion of Su\u00e1rez's shots are self-created, following good movement into the channels, a quick turn and then a direct dart into the box. His shot after 40 minutes of Saturday's meeting with Arsenal was a fine example \u2013 he rolled Thomas Vermaelen, turned past Alex Song, skipped away from Bacary Sagna and then cut inside Laurent Koscielny within five seconds, to present himself with a clear sight of goal 10 yards out, having picked up the ball on the edge of the area with his back to goal. Having expended so much energy with the burst past opponents, and with his balance increasingly slipping away as he escaped past each challenge, in the end all he could manage was a tame, stabbed shot that was easily turned away by Wojciech Szczesny. How much credit do you give the player for creating the opportunity, and how much blame for squandering it? In a one-off incident it's an exceptional piece of skill. Yet when the pattern is repeated over a period of nearly 90 shots (not all in this fashion, of course), you wonder if Su\u00e1rez is simply trying to do too much. Su\u00e1rez's best role is up for debate \u2013 his good form at Ajax came when moving inside from a right-sided position, then with Uruguay he excelled at the Copa Am\u00e9rica last year when used as the primary striker. Importantly, he seemed to have much more of a defined role in the side, much stricter instructions. At Liverpool his role has varied between playing up front alone, and just behind Andy Carroll. He's generally been Liverpool's best attacking player this season \u2013 though Craig Bellamy has also played well \u2013 but too much of the play is dependent upon him, and he becomes the main man responsible for both creativity and goalscoring. To do two things at once is to do neither, Publilius Syrus once wrote, and Suarez's six goals are supplemented by a single assist. Granted, pinning him down to a more specific role would be tricky considering the woes of his team-mates. You don't want to depend on Stewart Downing for service at the moment, nor on Carroll for goals, and Su\u00e1rez often seems keener to go alone than involve certain other team-mates in his play. But one man running the show can cause others problems \u2013 David Beckham famously averted a crisis against Greece in 2001, but had probably contributed to the crisis with his positionless Roy of the Rovers act for much of the game. At heart Su\u00e1rez is a goalscorer, and it is only fine margins costing him. He's hit the woodwork six times this season \u2013 as many times as he has scored. That record suggests that he's on the right track, and he can look to his opposing striker on Saturday to see how important a couple of inches can be \u2013 Robin van Persie was previously the king of hitting the woodwork, now he's the best finisher in the Premier League. The Arsenal captain has evolved from an all-rounder who picked the ball up in deep positions, to more of a finisher. He's less involved in the play, but clearly playing the most effective football of his career. He received the ball less than half as often as Su\u00e1rez on Saturday \u2013 but twice he got the ball in the box, and both chances were converted with a one-touch finish. Potency up front was the only difference between the sides at Anfield on Saturday. It's not that Liverpool don't have their Van Persie figure, they're just yet to bring out his full potential. SHOT IN THE FOOT One thing Chelsea were consistently good at throughout the Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's spell in charge was not allowing the opposition shots \u2013 coming into the Premier League weekend, they'd conceded fewer shots than any other team in the league. But by the end even that record was no longer intact, as Chelsea conceded 25 shots against West Brom \u2013 the most they had conceded for over three years, since Luiz Felipe Scolari was in charge of a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool, according to Opta. On that day, Chelsea were down to 10 men for a significant period \u2013 and Chelsea managed to hang out until the 88th minute, before conceding two goals in the final three minues \u2013 both scored by Fernando Torres. BALANCED COTTAGERS Clint Dempsey's fifth goal in Fulham's thrashing of Wolves ruined their chances of having a perfectly balanced record in the Premier League this season \u2013 they've won nine, drawn nine and lost nine of their 27 games, and were it not for the excellent fifth goal, they would have scored 36, conceded 36, and on 36 points. More importantly, this is the first time Fulham have put together a run of three consecutive wins since the final three games of the 2007-08 season, when they escaped relegation on goal difference.",

The main thing this says is that they're constant threat, which is something Su\u00e1rez \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 also offers.</p> <p>Glenn Hoddle once said that Andy Cole needed six or seven chances to score one goal, which was an extremely harsh reflection on an excellent striker, especially as the criticism stuck with Cole for the rest of his career. But if, for a second, we take Hoddle's view as gospel (which is always a slightly dangerous game), was Cole's problem that he needed six or seven chances? Or that he needed six or seven chances that had been created by others? Cole wasn't simply a finisher, but he was predominantly a penalty box player. The apparent wastefulness was more obvious when it came at the end of a swerving David Beckham cross, from a lofted Paul Scholes pass or following a surging Ryan Giggs dribble. It looked as if he was letting the side down, ruining someone else's good work.</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez is completely different. If Cole's need for six or seven chances was worthy of criticism, Su\u00e1rez's record of scoring a goal every 14.8 shots is truly terrible (with the caveat that a \"shot\" is not quite the same as a \"chance\"). If he were a pure poacher, that ratio would be worthy of a place on the bench.</p> <p>Yet a decent proportion of Su\u00e1rez's shots are self-created, following good movement into the channels, a quick turn and then a direct dart into the box. His shot after 40 minutes of Saturday's meeting with Arsenal was a fine example \u2013 he rolled Thomas Vermaelen, turned past Alex Song, skipped away from Bacary Sagna and then cut inside Laurent Koscielny within five seconds, to present himself with a clear sight of goal 10 yards out, having picked up the ball on the edge of the area with his back to goal. Having expended so much energy with the burst past opponents, and with his balance increasingly slipping away as he escaped past each challenge, in the end all he could manage was a tame, stabbed shot that was easily turned away by Wojciech Szczesny. How much credit do you give the player for creating the opportunity, and how much blame for squandering it? In a one-off incident it's an exceptional piece of skill. Yet when the pattern is repeated over a period of nearly 90 shots (not all in this fashion, of course), you wonder if Su\u00e1rez is simply trying to do too much.</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez's best role is up for debate \u2013 his good form at Ajax came when moving inside from a right-sided position, then with Uruguay he excelled at the Copa Am\u00e9rica last year when used as the primary striker. Importantly, he seemed to have much more of a defined role in the side, much stricter instructions. At Liverpool his role has varied between playing up front alone, and just behind Andy Carroll. He's generally been Liverpool's best attacking player this season \u2013 though Craig Bellamy has also played well \u2013 but too much of the play is dependent upon him, and he becomes the main man responsible for both creativity and goalscoring. To do two things at once is to do neither, Publilius Syrus once wrote, and Suarez's six goals are supplemented by a single assist.</p> <p>Granted, pinning him down to a more specific role would be tricky considering the woes of his team-mates. You don't want to depend on Stewart Downing for service at the moment, nor on Carroll for goals, and Su\u00e1rez often seems keener to go alone than involve certain other team-mates in his play. But one man running the show can cause others problems \u2013 David Beckham famously averted a crisis against Greece in 2001, but had probably contributed to the crisis with his positionless Roy of the Rovers act for much of the game.</p> <p>At heart Su\u00e1rez is a goalscorer, and it is only fine margins costing him. He's hit the woodwork six times this season \u2013 as many times as he has scored. That record suggests that he's on the right track, and he can look to his opposing striker on Saturday to see how important a couple of inches can be \u2013 Robin van Persie was previously the king of hitting the woodwork, now he's the best finisher in the Premier League.</p> <p>The Arsenal captain has evolved from an all-rounder who picked the ball up in deep positions, to more of a finisher. He's less involved in the play, but clearly playing the most effective football of his career. He received the ball less than half as often as Su\u00e1rez on Saturday \u2013 but twice he got the ball in the box, and both chances were converted with a one-touch finish.</p> <p>Potency up front was the only difference between the sides at Anfield on Saturday. It's not that Liverpool don't have their Van Persie figure, they're just yet to bring out his full potential.</p> <h2>SHOT IN THE FOOT</h2> <p>One thing Chelsea were consistently good at throughout the Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's spell in charge was not allowing the opposition shots \u2013 coming into the Premier League weekend, they'd conceded fewer shots than any other team in the league. But by the end even that record was no longer intact, as Chelsea conceded 25 shots against West Brom \u2013 the most they had conceded for over three years, since Luiz Felipe Scolari was in charge of a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool, according to Opta. On that day, Chelsea were down to 10 men for a significant period \u2013 and Chelsea managed to hang out until the 88th minute, before conceding two goals in the final three minues \u2013 both scored by Fernando Torres.</p> <h2>BALANCED COTTAGERS</h2> <p>Clint Dempsey's fifth goal in Fulham's thrashing of Wolves ruined their chances of having a perfectly balanced record in the Premier League this season \u2013 they've won nine, drawn nine and lost nine of their 27 games, and were it not for the excellent fifth goal, they would have scored 36, conceded 36, and on 36 points. More importantly, this is the first time Fulham have put together a run of three consecutive wins since the final three games of the 2007-08 season, when they escaped relegation on goal difference.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Theresa May, has begun a three-day visit to Jordan in an attempt to break the deadlock over the deportation of the al-Qaida terror suspect Abu Qatada. May, who will be in Amman until Wednesday, is hoping to make sufficient progress to at least return the radical Islamist cleric to Long Lartin maximum-security prison pending his deportation to Jordan. Last month, Abu Qatada was released on bail under conditions that amount to virtual house arrest and include a 22-hour curfew after the European court of human rights ruled that the deportation could not go ahead while he faced the risk of a trial based on evidence obtained by torture. He has been described as Osama bin Laden's righthand man in Europe and is still regarded as a threat to British national security. Speaking in Jordan, May said: \"We and the Jordanian government will continue to work together to progress this case. \"Jordan has made significant human rights advances, including changes to its constitution. Sadly, the court at Strasbourg failed to recognise this. \"Talks today have been positive but we have more work to do in getting the kind of assurances that will allow us to deport [Abu] Qatada once and for all. \"This case has gone on for over a decade and I want to bring it to a satisfactory end soon.\" In London, the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, said: \"Obviously, there is a problem with torture in that country, and I know that Theresa is extremely anxious to get credible assurances from the Jordanians that, if they put him on trial, there won't be evidence used against him that has been obtained by torture. \"That's a long-standing principle of human rights law. The British courts and European courts, every country that adheres to the European convention on human rights, is highly sensitive about torture. \"You can't have a system of justice with torture involved. \"She got good assurances from the Jordanians about Abu Qatada himself not being tortured and the court in Strasbourg accepted that. \"I hope she's successful in getting the assurances she is now seeking about the trial.\" Mr Justice Mitting, of the special immigration appeals commission (Siac), gave the home secretary three months to show that \"demonstrable progress\" was being made in Abu Qatada's deportation or face his release without restrictions. May is hoping to secure fresh diplomatic assurances that he will face a fair trial in Amman on his return. They will have to be robust enough to convince the Siac judges that they will apply in practice. The home secretary's talks this week follow an intervention by David Cameron, who phoned King Abdullah of Jordan to seek \"an effective solution\" to the case. The Home Office minister James Brokenshire, who visited Amman to pave the way for this week's talks, said on Sunday: \"I think the discussions with the Jordanians were actually very, very useful. There was a strong recognition from the Jordanian government as to the responsibility they have for one of their own citizens. \"Yes, of course there are detailed legal issues that I discussed when I was in Jordan that are being worked through with our officials and lawyers. \"It's just working through some of the legal detail, which is why we judge it is important to get this right so when we go back to the special immigration court we can present the strongest possible case to see [Abu] Qatada removed rapidly.\" Abu Qatada's lawyers have warned that any fresh diplomatic deal will trigger a new round of litigation in the London courts. The most May can expect to hope for is that Abu Qatada is returned to Long Lartin pending the outcome of those proceedings. He has spent nearly nine years detained or deprived of his liberty under curfew without charge in Britain.ends",

Sadly, the court at Strasbourg failed to recognise this.</p> <p>\"Talks today have been positive but we have more work to do in getting the kind of assurances that will allow us to deport [Abu] Qatada once and for all.</p> <p>\"This case has gone on for over a decade and I want to bring it to a satisfactory end soon.\"</p> <p>In London, the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, said: \"Obviously, there is a problem with torture in that country, and I know that Theresa is extremely anxious to get credible assurances from the Jordanians that, if they put him on trial, there won't be evidence used against him that has been obtained by torture.</p> <p>\"That's a long-standing principle of human rights law. The British courts and European courts, every country that adheres to the European convention on human rights, is highly sensitive about torture.</p> <p>\"You can't have a system of justice with torture involved.</p> <p>\"She got good assurances from the Jordanians about Abu Qatada himself not being tortured and the court in Strasbourg accepted that.</p> <p>\"I hope she's successful in getting the assurances she is now seeking about the trial.\"</p> <p>Mr Justice Mitting, of the special immigration appeals commission (Siac), gave the home secretary three months to show that \"demonstrable progress\" was being made in Abu Qatada's deportation or face his release without restrictions.</p> <p>May is hoping to secure fresh diplomatic assurances that he will face a fair trial in Amman on his return. They will have to be robust enough to convince the Siac judges that they will apply in practice.</p> <p>The home secretary's talks this week follow an intervention by David Cameron, who phoned King Abdullah of Jordan to seek \"an effective solution\" to the case.</p> <p>The Home Office minister James Brokenshire, who visited Amman to pave the way for this week's talks, said on Sunday: \"I think the discussions with the Jordanians were actually very, very useful. There was a strong recognition from the Jordanian government as to the responsibility they have for one of their own citizens.</p> <p>\"Yes, of course there are detailed legal issues that I discussed when I was in Jordan that are being worked through with our officials and lawyers.</p> <p>\"It's just working through some of the legal detail, which is why we judge it is important to get this right so when we go back to the special immigration court we can present the strongest possible case to see [Abu] Qatada removed rapidly.\"</p> <p>Abu Qatada's lawyers have warned that any fresh diplomatic deal will trigger a new round of litigation in the London courts.</p> <p>The most May can expect to hope for is that Abu Qatada is returned to Long Lartin pending the outcome of those proceedings. He has spent nearly nine years detained or deprived of his liberty under curfew without charge in Britain.ends</p>",

David Almond wrote Skellig as a one off title but his readers longed to know more about his characters.

      "bodyText": "Wrexham \u2013 average sunshine: three hours a day for four months of the year \u2013 has joined Sacramento in California, desert city Abu Dhabi and Freiburg in Germany as a new solar power centre. The north Walian town, which has had one of Europe's largest solar panel factories since 2005, employing around 1,000 people, moves into the renewable energy premier league this month after installing 30,000 panels made in the town on 3,000 of its council homes. This year it will fit six schools and several public buildings with a further 90kW of solar power. Scaffolding was bought in from all over Cheshire and north Wales to complete Europe's biggest social housing solar scheme by 4 March, the cut-off date which allowed installations to earn the higher government solar incentive (assuming a government appeal in the courts fails). \"They have been going up like mushrooms. Everyone got them, even my auntie,\" said Jackie Downward, a resident of Hullah Lane, Wrexham who had eight panels installed on the roof of her pebble-dashed 1960s semi. \"I've never taken an interest in green things before. Some people say they look ugly but most say they wouldn't mind them. I only heard of one couple who said they wouldn't have them on their roof. In the end, it's money off your bills and jobs so it has to be worth it,\" she said. In what council chiefs say was a \"sensible\" investment, Wrexham last year borrowed nearly \u00a328m for the 5MW scheme to equip one in three of its properties with panels made by Japanese company Sharp, which has a solar module factory on the edge of the town. Tenants, who pay on average around \u00a370 a week to rent their homes, can expect \u00a3200-300 a year off their bills from the electricity they generate and the council will make over \u00a31m a year profit from feed-in tariffs, the government's solar incentive scheme. The money will increase Wrexham's housing budget by nearly 10%, and will be invested back in public housing. In a riposte to critics who dismissed solar as a technology only for the wealthy, the town \u2013 which has some of Britain's most deprived estates \u2013 expects its investment to lift people out of fuel poverty, benefit its schools and old people, and reduce carbon emissions by 3,000 tonnes a year. Sharp says it has invested \u00a343m in its Wrexham solar plant and that 132 people worked nearly six months to install the panels on council homes. The investment should also lift Wrexham to near the top of the UK league table for emission reductions. By 2020 it expects a 70% cut on 2005 figures \u2013 way above central government targets and possibly the most by any British borough. But while it may be one of the only towns in Britain to have boosted its economy with solar, it has been hard hit by the government's decision before Christmas to halve solar incentives]. As a direct result, solar panel manufacturers, including Sharp, have had to lay off people, and Wrexham's expected income from the panels will drop. \"We were never doing this for the money. Our intention was always to reduce emissions. We will still make a profit but it will take longer,\" said a council spokeswoman. The halving of the 43p incentive for solar installations is expected to hit the solar industry hard. The fledgling industry, which employs 30,000, says it is \"facing ruin\" after the energy minister, Greg Barker, further slashed incentives for people investing after July 2012. Installations completed by July will continue to get the 21p incentive, but after that could drop to 13p and may only be available to people who have insulated their homes to a certain level. Explosive growth in solar panel installations on homes, schools and fields in the UK over the past 22 months saw the green energy source pass the symbolic milestone of 1,000MW last month. \"It showed very clearly that people were desperate to get out of the clutches of the big six energy companies, which hate the idea of people generating their own electricity. There goes a small industry which has invested hundreds of millions of pounds,\" said Daniel Green of solar energy company Homesun. \"This is the steady strangulation of a successful industry. First it was by stealth, now it's blatant. This company alone had 330,000 applications for solar in 18 months. There must have been millions of people across Britain who were interested in installing it and in generating their own electricity,\" said Green \"The industry has taken a massive knock The government is preparing to kill off the industry altogether,\" said Jed Rowbottom, director of Burnley-based solar company Solarlec. But Jeremy Leggett, chair of Solar Century, said the solar would not be crushed. \"The government does not want anything to impinge on the prospect of centralised power from the big six electricity companies. But well before 2020 solar will be cheaper than nuclear or gas. It's not the end of the industry but of our opportunity in Britain to grow a domestic industry that could compete with those in Germany and elsewhere. It will explode again, but it will not be British.\" Since the feed-in tariff scheme was launched by the Labour administration in April 2010 the amount of solar has grown by over 40 times. There was just 26MW of solar before the scheme.",

      "bodyText": "British pop music in the mid-70s was flabby, overblown, overpraised, lazy. It was dominated by figures such as Rod Stewart, Elton John, and momentarily, incredibly, Peter Frampton \u2013 and ready for an uprising. A few months before punk, the first sign a new order on the way was an awkward little rocker from Camberley called Graham Parker. He was a skinny, T-shirted figure in shades; rough, honest, and angry. Heat Treatment has a Dylanesque snarl to it; a thirst for revenge in the light of the lost years mentioned above, and a sense of cutting to the chase, that there was no more time to waste. I picked up Heat Treatment on the car radio while driving past Sheffield on the way to see my student girlfriend up north in the winter of 1976. As the temperature dropped outside, the punch of Parker \u2013 abetted by the Rumour, remnants of that great pub-rock band, Brinsley Schwarz \u2013 made me put my foot down, warmed my heart. I thought I'd found a new Dylan from the home counties. But the truth was, you didn't come across Graham Parker on the dial that often. Although he appeared on the bill at Dylan's concert at Blackbushe Aerodrome in 1978, only a few miles from his Camberley stamping ground, it was already clear by that time that the superior sneer, machine-gun delivery and catchy tunes of Elvis Costello would eventually leave Parker thumbing a lift by the roadside as the new wave bus roared off without him.

Do you pursue your passion at all costs (regardless of the state of the industry), or do you fall into a career by accident? Standard career advice is to identify your marketable strengths, along with your interests and values. Ideally, you can then match these to companies that need your skills and where you'd enjoy working. But when so many traditional graduate roles seem to require the same sets of skills and attributes, identifying sectors, companies or roles becomes more difficult. Here are other ways to approach your career decision-making. Analyse market trends Entire sectors are changing, jobs are disappearing, and skills are becoming obsolete. Stay ahead of recruitment patterns and get an overview of which sectors are healthy, and which are predicted to shrink through surveys like this. Find out where companies are expanding, and which skills are in demand. Resources such as the Future Work Skills report are also helpful in identifying wider employment trends. For example, a shift towards specialist skills is currently underway. In \"The end of a job as we know it\" the author argues that the concept of a job is beginning to disappear, to be replaced by a need for expertise. Employers look for values, skills and fit, rather than experience. For job seekers, this means that your long-term value and employability will depend on how much need there is for your specialist skills. Staying relevant means assessing and adjusting these, either through deepening them, or by turning them in new directions. Without a particular area of expertise, you'll find it harder to get work. Consider less obvious choices Your degree doesn't necessarily lock you into one career. In an article for Guardian Careers Jane Artess, director of research at the Higher Education Careers Services Unit, points out that around six in 10 graduates are recruited to jobs where their degree subject \"was not the deal-breaker\". Explore a range of sectors and companies. Ask for informational interviews or a chance to work shadow; and read resources such as 'A working life' or the Guardian Careers insider guides to find out what jobs typically involve and what employers look for in their employees. Don't discount smaller or mid-size companies, which can often expose you to a wider range of roles and responsibilities than larger companies. Experiment 'Job hopping' isn't always a disadvantage - especially at the early stages of your career when you're still working out what you like or dislike in a job. Instead, consider all roles as an opportunity to deepen your skillset and expertise. Take a more long-term view of your career, and don't feel obliged to commit your entire working life to one company or sector. Remember: what you want or need from a job will evolve, and you should review your needs and ambitions regularly. Experiment with different types of employment.

The \"mystery shopper\" initiative was launched in February 2011 as part of the government's bid to open up its huge procurement business to more competition and increased tenders from SMEs. Suppliers were invited to report instances where procurement had been difficult or poor and as a result the Cabinet Office has since seen rather more of the postman than it used to. Laudable though this initiative might have seemed, the government lacks the dexterity of most retailers and can't easily re-arrange the store when abnormalities appear. Instead it has found itself sucked into a vortex of complaints that if it isn't very careful could become a fulltime endeavour with little prospect of the queue ever diminishing. Since complaining customers have a habit of infecting others, this initiative may ultimately only inflame a problem rather than lance a boil. While there's no debate that the boil needs lancing this isn't a skin-deep problem \u2013 quite the opposite in fact. Government procurement regulations are a world apart from the experiences of most small businesses. Apart from the fact that the government appears to be putting out ever-bigger tenders that SMEs can't hope to match, the difficulty of competing appears to be escalating. After all, how many companies can afford the luxury of speculating their time and energy on 30- to 50-page tender forms, while obtaining financial securities and becoming extra compliant? The fact that so many don't even consider government work an option is a measure of the scale of the turnaround required to make Britain more SME-centric. As procurement specialists freely admit, learning to tender is a specialist skill, a bit like speaking another foreign language, which for many companies right now is a luxury they can ill afford. Yet isn't it more important that the government learns SME language? The business of procurement is in effect a giant information exchange with an awful lot of duplication. Companies are required to supply data about their commerce, the way they work and what they've achieved, just in order to meet the prerequisites of tendering. One might reasonably expect such data would help government agencies to push more work in the direction of companies with the potential to create jobs. Instead the information appears less productive and perversely probably fuels the disparate picture of SMEs. Small businesses are no better understood as a result. Yet in addition to cutting red tape the government could make procurement information more useful to all. Many smaller companies are handicapped by a lack of competitive intelligence and would certainly benefit from being able to compare how they operate with others.

      "bodyText": "The father of Baby P has been awarded \u00a375,000 in damages after the People falsely claimed he was a convicted sex offender. Peter Connelly's natural father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, won the payout after the high court in London agreed on Monday that he was wrongly accused of raping a 14-year-old girl in the 1970s. Mr Justice Bean ordered Mirror Group Newspapers, publisher of the People, to pay an initial \u00a330,000 in damages plus costs of \u00a335,000. The damages payout will rise to \u00a375,000 if the publisher loses permission to take the ruling to the court of appeal. The allegations were contained in two paragraphs in a crime supplement in the People about Baby P's mother, who had separated from the child's father, referred to in court as KC. They appeared in a 19 September 2010 article headed \"Tortured to death as mum turned a blind eye\". Baby P was 17 months old when he was found dead in a blood-splattered cot at his mother's home in Tottenham, north London, in August 2007. He had more than 50 injuries. Bean said in his written judgment: \"It is difficult to think of any charge more calculated to lead to the revulsion and condemnation of a person's fellow citizens than the rape of a 14-year-old girl.\" KC said in his witness statement that he was \"shocked and upset beyond words\" by the false libel, which he first learned about in phone calls from close friends. The judge said the appropriate starting point for the damages was \u00a3150,000. But he reduced this by half, to \u00a375,000 because Mirror Group Newspapers moved swiftly to apologise and correct the error. The court was told in an earlier hearing that it was in fact the father of Tracey Connelly, the mother of Baby P, who was convicted of a sex offence in the 1970s. Mr Justice Bean said in his written judgment on Monday: \"It is common ground ... that the 1970s sex offender was in fact Tracey Connelly's father.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Police in Nashville, Tennessee, said his car was hit by 11 shots, and though 10 caused no harm, one caused a minor shoulder wound to his girfriend, Kenyetta Rainey. The incident took place at around 3:30am on Sunday, as Young Buck \u2013 real name David Brown \u2013 was driving home from the La Bamba nightclub in Nashville. A white Chevrolet Tahoe pulled up next to their Cadillac Escalade, and 11 shots were fired from the car. Rainey was treated at Vanderbilt hospital and released later that day.

      "bodyText": "The powers of London mayors are limited and often vague, but in public transport they are large and clear. Transport for London (TfL), the organisation that plans and runs most of the capital's transport system, is there to implement mayoral policies. It also has responsibilities for road management, cycling and pedestrians \u2013 issues I'll address in separate articles next week \u2013 but the capital's underground, overground, bus, Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and tram services are absolutely core concerns. Transport also provides the mayor with a measure of financial autonomy. TfL's roughly \u00a38bn annual budget comes mostly from \u00a33.3bn in government grants and other sources, from congestion charging to property sales and borrowing, but around \u00a33.5bn comes from fares, whose level the mayor sets. Labour's Ken Livingstone is promising to reduce these by 7% by 7 October or resign, and raise them by no more the rate of inflation from 2014 if elected on 3 May. Tory incumbent Boris Johnson is committed to yearly increases of the inflation rate plus 2% and claims that Livingstone's proposals would damage TfL's investment programme. Liberal Democrat candidate Brian Paddick is proposing selected fare reductions in the form of \"early bird\" morning rates and a one-hour bus pass aimed at helping some of London's low-paid workers. Most passengers want fares to be as low as possible, of course \u2013 and London's fares are the highest of any big city in the world \u2013 but the Model Mayor would also need a solid plan for the future of London's public transport infrastructure and how it's going to be paid for. Completing the underground upgrade programme is a given, and the trans-London Crossrail line is on its way. How strong, though, is the case for Crossrail Two? What about High Speed Two? Should other, smaller, projects mothballed by the current mayor, such as the DLR extension to Dagenham Dock or the Cross River Tram be revived? Should there be more trams? How persuasive are alternative forms and sources of investment, such as those TfL has been exploring for a Northern line extension to Nine Elms? Green party candidate Jenny Jones says \u00a31bn a year could be raised for public transport from a London-wide pay-as-you-go road-pricing scheme (a policy we'll concentrate on later this week). What principles should guide future investment in bus and rail services? The Model Mayor would also need solid human resources strategies. Behind the rows over London Underground ticket office opening hours lurks a political consensus that staff are best deployed outside them. Are you part of it? Are industrial relations improved by bringing the unions on to the TfL board or by keeping them at arms length? Should the mayor be directly involved with pay and conditions negotiations? I'll end by mentioning a couple of other public transport topics doing the rounds. Both Livingstone and Johnson have proposed that the mayor takes control of National Rail services within London. Would it be worth the trouble? How can the Oyster card system be improved on? Should it be completely replaced? It's been argued that the current zoning of the public transport system should be changed. And here's a final thought: many young Londoners enjoy free bus travel at the moment. Might charging them a token fare encourage them to appreciate the service more? I'll be responding to your thoughtful comments until around noon. The best will be appended to the main article later today. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree Whitesteps suggests: I think we need an independent evaluation of the value for money offered by the Tube upgrade program - despite constant reassurances that the program is proceeding well, and constantly rising fares to pay for it, I just can't see any evidence of it leading to any significant improvements. I take the Victoria line - the introduction of the new train stock offers minimal (if any) additional capacity, but continues to cause delays as the doors are far more sensitive to disruption that the old stock. DaveHill responds: Good morning! An independent evaluation of the upgrade programme's cost-effectiveness would be interesting. Who do you think could and should conduct it? If the evaluation concluded that it wasn't worth the money, what would the Model Mayor do next? newenergyspace suggests: The main problem with transport in London is capacity, they have to keep it expensive to stop everyone using it. What is needed is an expansion of the number of Tube trains and buses to accommodate a decrease in ticket prices across each. DaveHill responds: Thanks. Increasing Tube capacity has, of course, been the point of the upgrade programme. Do you enviage adding still more to Tube capacity, and if so can you explain how - and how you think it could best be paid for? Do you think Ken Livingstone's reducing all public transport fares would help or hinder? Hooloovoo suggests: Much greater control over the unions please. Bring in driverless trains, like the DLR. Something like 47 tube strikes we've had in 4 years and we're absolutely sick of it. DaveHill responds: Tube industrial relations are not good, but what's the best way to improve them? There have been far more Tube strikes under Boris than there were under Ken. There a number of possible reasons for that, including luck. A while back the LSE's Tony Travers told the Evening Standard that Ken had \"spooked\" them. He knows his way around the backwaters of the left. Could be an advantage. antgunvoy suggests: BJ's early decision to wipe out the proposed Peckham to Camden tram link was a real shame. This would be a great opportunity to regenerate rundown and relatively central areas such as Peckham and Walworth and should be looked at again. The politicians have to start thinking long-term if we're to see a fairer, more mobile city. Something has to be done about the disgusting and selfish behaviour which civilised Londoners have to bear, particularly on the buses - streams of fluid, mounds of litter, dirty tissues and chicken bones (yes, really!) left on seats, on-board spitting (yes, truly!) ridiculous noise levels from phones and phone conversations. Would limiting the amount of free travel for young people help here? I'm not sure. They're not the only group guilty of making such a mess and such a racket. I've never witnessed such filthy behaviour in any other major, developed city. Conductors - bring em back. Transport police - make yourselves visible. One thing is for sure, the whole system needs absolutely massive investment. I can't see how fares can be lowered in view of the state of this shameful, creaking, overcrowded network. DaveHill responds: You mention bringing back conductors, or their modern day equivalent. I'm sure most Londoners would love that especially if it improved civility. But they're expensive... osbournecox suggests: Suspend free travel for the elderly and children between 7:30am - 9:30am and 4:30pm - 6:30pm. Introduce a token fare instead. This would discourage unnecessary journeys at these peak commuting times but keep necessary journeys affordable. DaveHill responds: Where the elderly are concerned, that would reduce the power of the Freedom Pass. Political suicide? newenergyspace suggests: It seems to me that in terms of public transport, the best policy to adopt is one of charging many many people less than charging a few more to use a smaller system. DaveHill responds: That's very much my instinct too, which is why I think the principle behind Ken's Fare Deal pledge is sound, even though it's also nakedly populist. But more people using public transport means a demand for more capacity. That's fine by me too, but providing it costs money at a time when government funding seems more likely to go down than up. Would total fares income increase under lower fares and by enough to pay for more capacity? My abacus already has a headache. Monty2001 suggests: Some thoughts: Increase congestion charge further into West London. Paddocks idea's about one hour bus passes are good. Promote flexible working hours to ease rush hour(s). A real time measure of how busy different routes are (rather than just notices of delays), available to view, would be helpful in chosing with route to a given destination. A bit like a public transport version of road cogestion updates. Free transport for people with baby buggies so long as they travel out of peak hours. A fast route from zone 3/4 into zone 1 for all those people currently using the northern line in south London. I'd like to see extentions to the London overground or something like Chicago's 'L' to offer an alternative in area's that get far too busy (most London terminals at 6pm). Automate the tube and/or remove the 'right' to strike for London unerground workers (with conditions). DaveHill responds: Thanks for these thoughts. I think congestion charging is part of an ideal solution, and we'll be looking at that in detail on Thursday. I wonder if your flexible working hours idea will get a shove forward from people trying it out during the Olympics? Am I alone in knowing little about Chicago's \"L\" (\"El\" - short for elevated, i gather)? Further reading here. LibDemCurmudgeon suggests: Perhaps this - set up incentives and some seed money for London to establish a city-wide broadband network to rival the speeds experienced in South Korea (they are working on 1 Gbps lines). Then offer incentives to companies that allow their employees to work from home. This should then knock out at least a segment of workers who travel in the mornings and evenings, thus reducing the strain on the system. DaveHill responds: That tickles my fancy. How much would it cost? Home working strikes me as very sensible. I'm doing it at this very moment - while eating a lump of Christmas pudding, as it happens. P0kerFace suggests: Key principle: Remove the need to commute long distances into central london. This can be done mainly through decentralisation. Connect up parts of the city that have few or slow public transport connections, meaning people choose not to live in them and businesses not to set up in them. Shorter journeys also encourages friendlier forms of transport such as walking/cycling. This can save the average person a lot of money too by opening up areas with lower rents and reducing transport costs. DaveHill responds: It's a good principle, I think. However, providing transport connections that aren't radial - linking the suburbs to the centre - does present challenges. Boris promised to trial orbital bus services. He did, but they didn't catch on. I'm sure you're thinking on a wider canvas than that, but perhaps it's a question of continuing to figure out what works. SimonLegg suggests: The problem with transport isn't transport, but the pattern of settlement, and, to his great credit, that's something that Ken was attempting to get to grips with. London is a suburban city with few dense concentrations of population. Londoners commute great distances, and, if their commutes don't run along the radial tube, bus and rail routes, they're choices are few. Town planners have, historically, applied a picturesque policy to suburban centres - it beggars belief that it took so long to develop high rises in places like Ilford and Croydon, and, even now, it's usual for high streets to be restricted to three or four storeys, whereas the average Italian high street in medium sized towns is six or eight. The key to making London a walking and cycling city is not to carve up the streets by putting in cycling lanes or wasting millions on signposts for pedestrians, but, rather, to encourage the redevelopment of our late nineteenth century and early twentieth century high streets, giving the businesses at ground floor a dogs chance of competing against the superstores and bringing dwellings closer to the main radial routes. We could, as a city, further redress the balance by taxing car park spaces (\u00a32000 a year would be a decent start) because these generate congestion, firming up the bus lanes (why on earth are there no bus lanes down Streatham High Road) and taxing private cars on radial routes. DaveHill responds: Thank you in particular for these thoughts, among your others: London is a suburban city with few dense concentrations of population. Londoners commute great distances, and, if their commutes don't run along the radial tube, bus and rail routes, their choices are few... The key to making London a walking and cycling city is not to carve up the streets by putting in cycling lanes or wasting millions on signposts for pedestrians, but, rather, to encourage the redevelopment of our late nineteenth century and early twentieth century high streets, giving the businesses at ground floor a dogs chance of competing against the superstores. Is your thinking in line with Edward Glaeser's? Up not out. He is an advocate of building \"up\" (the elevator) rather than building \"out\" (the car). Building up often involves tearing down what already exists (our heritage) and rebuilding in a new character (taller) that fits new demands for more concentrated and productive living. Suburban living, he points out, is surrounded by greenery, but is not \"green.\" The suburbanite is tethered to a car to get anywhere, and separated (as opposed to stacked) living units cost more to heat and cool. Preservation should be focused and limited. In this same vein, he argues that preservation should be limited and focused rather than widespread and indiscriminate. He says preservation restrictions should target only the most significant or beautiful structures, but not every old structure. Cities must be allowed to remake themselves if they are to remain productive and affordable. thereverent suggests: Rather than fiddle around with congestion charges for different types of vehicles. How about reducing on-street parking in central London? If you can't park there you aren't going to drive. There are still plenty of people who will drive into central at the moment and getting them on other forms of transport would greatly reduce congestion. It would also make the streets more pleasant for pedestrains and cyclists. The Evening Standard would hate it, of course. Westminster Council charging for single lane parking changes was a good idea, it's a shame it got shouted down. There were plenty of car park spaces available, but people wanted to park for free. DaveHill responds: Hello thereverent. Always good to hear from you. The Standard certainly would hate it and so would Nick Ferrari and so would the Westminster Council Labour group. The furore over Colin Barrow's proposals was quite amazing I thought, and serves as a warning to all those who, like me, think London as a whole would benefit from using market mechanisms to reduce car use. That doesn't mean we shouldn't make the case for it, though. But how?",

It also has responsibilities for road management, cycling and pedestrians \u2013 issues I'll address in separate articles next week \u2013 but the capital's <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2625.aspx\" title=\"\">underground</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2688.aspx\" title=\"\">overground</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2605.aspx\" title=\"\">bus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2632.aspx\" title=\"\">Docklands Light Railway</a> (DLR) and <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2674.aspx\" title=\"\">tram</a> services are absolutely core concerns.</p> <p>Transport also provides the mayor with a measure of financial autonomy. TfL's roughly \u00a38bn annual budget comes mostly from \u00a33.3bn in government grants and other sources, from congestion charging to property sales and borrowing, but around \u00a33.5bn comes from fares, whose level the mayor sets. Labour's Ken Livingstone is promising to reduce these by 7% by 7 October or resign, and raise them by no more the rate of inflation from 2014 if elected on 3 May. Tory incumbent Boris Johnson is committed to yearly increases of the inflation rate plus 2% and claims that Livingstone's proposals would damage TfL's investment programme. Liberal Democrat candidate Brian Paddick is proposing selected fare reductions in the form of \"early bird\" morning rates and a one-hour bus pass aimed at helping some of London's low-paid workers.</p> <p>Most passengers want fares to be as low as possible, of course \u2013 and London's fares are the highest of any big city in the world \u2013 but the Model Mayor would also need a solid plan for the future of London's public transport infrastructure and how it's going to be paid for.</p> <p>Completing the underground upgrade programme is a given, and the trans-London <a href=\"http://www.crossrail.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Crossrail</a> line is on its way. How strong, though, is the case for <a href=\"http://www.crossrail.co.uk/route/safeguarding/chelsea-hackney-line\" title=\"\">Crossrail Two</a>? What about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/aug/26/high-speed-rail-report\" title=\"\">High Speed Two</a>? Should other, smaller, projects mothballed by the current mayor, such as the DLR extension to <a href=\"http://developments.dlr.co.uk/current/extensions/dagenham/\" title=\"\">Dagenham Dock</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/who-runs-london/the-london-assembly/publications/transport/cross-river-tram\" title=\"\">Cross River Tram</a> be revived? Should there be more trams? How persuasive are alternative forms and sources of investment, such as those TfL has been exploring for a <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/19950.aspx\" title=\"\">Northern line extension</a> to Nine Elms? Green party candidate Jenny Jones says \u00a31bn a year could be raised for public transport from a <a href=\"http://londonist.com/2012/02/mayoral-election-green-party-outlines-road-pricing-plan.php\" title=\"\">London-wide pay-as-you-go road-pricing scheme</a> (a policy we'll concentrate on later this week). What principles should guide future investment in bus and rail services?</p> <p>The Model Mayor would also need solid human resources strategies. Behind the rows over London Underground ticket office opening hours lurks a political consensus that staff are best deployed outside them. Are you part of it? Are industrial relations improved by bringing the unions on to the <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/boardandchiefofficers/1432.aspx\" title=\"\">TfL board</a> or by keeping them at arms length? Should the mayor be directly involved with pay and conditions negotiations?</p> <p>I'll end by mentioning a couple of other public transport topics doing the rounds. Both Livingstone and Johnson have proposed that the mayor takes control of National Rail services within London. Would it be worth the trouble? How can the Oyster card system be improved on? Should it be completely replaced? It's been argued that the current zoning of the public transport system should be changed. And here's a final thought: many young Londoners enjoy <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/14308.aspx\" title=\"\">free bus travel</a> at the moment. Might charging them a token fare encourage them to appreciate the service more?</p> <p>I'll be responding to your thoughtful comments until around noon.

      "bodyText": "The industrial situation at the Financial Times is now looking quite serious. Journalists who have voted to strike over a pay offer - the details of which are disputed - have called on Marjorie Scardino to intervene. As chief executive of Pearson, the FT's ultimate owner, the National Union of Journalists' members believe she has the final say. However, I'm uncertain whether she would be prepared to step in and, by implication, overrule the FT Group's management. I know she has a high regard for the FT, for its journalists, for journalism and for newspapers, but it's still a big ask for her to get so intimately involved in such a dispute. One problem she faces is having said the offer is \"3.5% with no compulsory redundancies\". It may be a short-form way of describing the offer but it doesn't quite square with the way the FT managers have put it. According to an official statement \"the proposed salary increase is 3.5% - with 2-2.5% for all editorial staff and 1% for merit, plus a bonus.\" The NUJ's own version, as outlined in an open letter to Scardino on 28 February, says that it amounts to a 2% pay rise for \"the vast majority\" while \"a handful of others and some non-journalists\" will receive 2.5%. The other 1%, says the union, \"is being kept back for use to 'retain staff' and to reward certain individuals in a non-transparent way at the sole discretion of the managing editor.\" On that basis, NUJ members voted by three to one to take strike action at a packed chapel meeting on 29 February. They have also called on management to meet at Acas. FT editor Lionel Barber has addressed staff and urged them not to strike. He has also said that action, though disruptive, will not prevent publication. Sources: NUJ/FT Group",

The Markit/Cips purchasing managers' index for services, released on Monday, dropped to 53.8 from 56, which had been a 10-month peak, in January. It remained well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, indicating that the UK economy will return to growth this quarter. City economists had expected a smaller dip, to 54.9. At the same time, confidence about the year ahead climbed to the highest level in 12 months, with more than half of services firms voicing optimism about their prospects against one in 10 who were downbeat. Employment also edged higher. The performance of the UK services sector contrasts with that of the eurozone. Separate data, released on Monday, showed the eurozone services sector contracted last month, in a blow to hopes that the region will avoid slipping back into recession. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said the UK PMI data was \"disappointing, but not the end of the world\". \"Overall, the PMIs are consistent with a moderate pace of expansion in overall GDP \u2013 broadly in line with what the Bank of England has assumed,\" he added. Other PMI releases last week showed that UK manufacturing also slowed last month while construction output grew at the fastest face in nearly a year. Taken together, the surveys suggest the economy will return to modest growth in the first quarter and escape a double dip recession assuming there is no further loss of momentum in March, Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, which compiles the reports, said. The British economy shrank by 0.2% in the final three months of last year.",

      "bodyText": "The Tate has acquired approximately 8m individual sculptures, its largest number of works of art ever, although each is smaller than a little finger nail: 10 tonnes of Ai Weiwei's famous porcelain sunflower seeds. There won't be enough to cover the floor of the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in London, as in the Chinese artist's installation in 2010, where the first visitors romped deliriously on a gritty beach until within 48 hours it was roped off, the ceramic dust condemned as a danger to health. Sunflower Seeds 2010, the work that the Tate has bought, represents less than a 10th of the 100m seeds, all individually sculpted and painted by Chinese craft workers, used for the installation. Instead the artist has suggested the seeds can be arranged either laid out as a square or, more dramatically, as a cone five metres in diameter and one and a half metres tall \u2013 as they have been displayed at Tate Modern as a loan from the artist from last June until earlier this year. The Tate acquired the work with the help of a grant from the Art Fund charity, but has not revealed the price. However, a quantity of the seeds were sold at a Sotheby's auction last year, soared above the top estimate and ended up at \u00a33.50 a seed. Ai Weiwei has become China's most famous living artist not just for the internationally admired quality of his work, but for his troubles with his native country, where he has recently faced house arrest, investigation for \"spreading pornography\" and the demolition of his studio. The Chinese authorities have charged him with tax evasion, but most commentators are convinced their real problem with him is his outspoken defence of human rights and criticism of China's treatment of dissidents. He is collaborating with the architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, the design team responsible for the bird's nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, to create this summer's temporary pavilion for the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park, London. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012 because the original said a similar quantity of seeds were sold at a Sotheby's auction last year. In fact 100 kilograms of seeds were sold at the auction last year.",

      "bodyText": "Without urgent and significant changes to the civil service, public services are in danger of failing in the UK, warns the new director of the Institute for Government. In an open letter to Sir Jeremy Heywood, the new cabinet secretary, and Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the civil service, Peter Riddell warns that \"unless reforms are urgently introduced, there will be the risk of a downward spiral of cuts, inadequate services and a demoralised civil service\". Fiscal austerity and unprecedented cuts in administrative budgets have created considerable uncertainty about the future of the civil service, Riddell writes. Its role in \"a smaller and reshaped state\" needs to be worked out if the service is to adapt successfully. \"The stakes are high, not just for the civil service and the coalition, but also for the public,\" writes Riddell. \"Success will help ensure that high quality services can be provided at a lower cost than before. Failure will mean not only a demoralised civil service but also inadequate services and a dissatisfied public.\" In his first major pronouncement since taking over the directorship of the institute, Riddell also takes aim at senior civil servants, and permanent secretaries in particular, who, he argues, must have more visibility and greater accountability for delivery. Ministers must also support reform, he writes, as previous reforms of the service have \"only been sustained when there is firm and clear ministerial backing, otherwise the forces of inertia and prevarication prevail\". The letter goes into detail about areas of service that need to be addressed urgently. This includes the way Whitehall conducts spending reviews and how it provides value for money. Far from a \"simplistic caricature of a closed, change-resistant and self-serving mandarinate\", much has been done to improve the service, which, he says, attracts some of the best national talent. Women, he points out, are running some of the toughest departments in Whitehall and capable of delivering significant programmes and embracing innovation. However, only a \"confident and effective civil service\" will cope with the \"unprecedented tests\" of legislative reforms in health, education, welfare, policing and justice, as well as big changes in defence and immigration. \"Deep rooted weaknesses\" could no longer be ignored in the face of the government's radical reform agenda, coupled with the huge scale of spending cuts. While some Whitehall departments had already shrunk by 20% and begun to set their own agenda, across the entire service, the lack of strategic co-ordination across all departments was a huge risk and would require Heywood and Kerslake to develop a leadership strategy that would take control and drive change. As part of the letter, the institute, after three years of looking into the problems, has identified six issues that it says are fundamental to reforming Whitehall: \u2022 An emphasis on raising value for money and fixing inadequate financial data: permanent secretaries should take personal responsibility for cutting waste. \u2022 A new approach to the spending review: departments need to discuss how to achieve cross-government efficiencies. \u2022 A fundamental shift in the way policies are designed and implemented; permanent secretaries should be accountable for quality. \u2022 Finding better ways of managing relationships with other public sector bodies and individuals including local authorities, arms length bodies, city mayors and police commissioners. \u2022 Raising capability and knowledge, particularly in financial management and policy areas, but also in leadership and change management. \u2022 An acceptance that there must be an open debate about the relationship between ministers and civil servants to overcome misunderstanding and distrust Riddell said the letter was intended to start a wider debate about civil service reform and government effectiveness. Heywood, Kerslake and Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude are due to give their response to the open letter at an event organised by the Institute for Government on Monday.

      "bodyText": "In the runup to June's Rio+20 Earth Summit, sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a hot topic. First proposed by the Columbian government, SDGs are now regarded by many as possible concrete outcomes from a conference whose prospects for delivering change otherwise seem gloomy at best. SDGs feature prominently in Rio's zero draft document and the recommendations of the UN High-level Panel on Global Sustainability. Others argue that SDGs should be signed in 2015, the deadline for the millennium development goals (MDGs), which have paid scant attention to environment and sustainability \u2013 confined to goal seven. A new set of SDGs could fill the MDG gaps and become a powerful successor global project that recognises the inextricable links between the environment and every dimension of development. Fulfilling these powerful aspirations means, inevitably, doing politics. To date, the pre-Rio global debate has not fully grasped how deeply this is true, and at how many levels. Certainly, there have been calls for governments to show \"political will\" \u2013 to turn up and act at Rio and beyond, as well as demands for high-level political leadership on sustainable development, whether from reformed UN institutions or \"leaders' summits\". Others are looking to social and environmental movements to push for change. Yet all this is essentially about the politics of buying in to the concept of SDGs. Beyond this, there is currently little clarity on what SDGs should involve, who should set them, and how they can be realised in practice. This is where the really knotty politics begins. The title of the Rio draft document and a catchphrase for the summit is The Future We Want. It is now clear that this future must be radically different from the past and that the current business-as-usual approach won't do. We need ambitious goals, for instance on stabilising global atmospheric CO2 concentrations and reducing the number of people facing hunger and water stress \u2013 despite population growth. In low-income and Bric countries, anxiety is already emerging about how to share the burdens of meeting ambitious global goals. Whether SDGs imply the old, industrialised north putting the brakes on others' development while avoiding costly changes to their own lifestyles and economies will certainly be part of the politics at Rio. Can the world develop a global \"we\" that moves beyond this polarisation, so well-worn in recent climate negotiations? More problematic still is the question of who \"we\" are when it comes to delivering on SDGs in real national and local settings. Here, there are multiple, disputed versions of \"sustainable development\" that imply different winners and losers. For example, in tackling water stress in India, does sustainable development mean addressing the needs of rapidly-growing urban populations and industries by building large dams? Or supporting the efforts of marginalised rural farmers and pastoralists to live with water uncertainties, through local knowledge and livelihood strategies? When it comes to combating hunger in settings such as rural Kenya, does sustainable development mean improving nationalfood security through boosting agricultural productivity, using modern plant breeding and genetic engineering to roll out technical solutions at scale? Or does it mean tackling diverse local food insecurities shaped by ecological, market, social and institutional contexts, through farmer-participatory approaches? Or, take the much-touted Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (Redd) schemes \u2013 will these secure the livelihoods of forest users while enabling them to benefit from carbon markets? Or will they become \"green grabs\" that appropriate local resource rights in the interests of global environmental repair? In reality, these choices are not so clear-cut. As our work at the STEPS Centre argues, multiple, diverse \"pathways\" will be needed to meet sustainable development challenges. The point is that not all of these can be pursued because there are inevitable trade-offs and competition between different alternatives. How these are resolved depends on power and politics, which are played out through the interactions of ministers and local government, corporations and businesses, citizens and users, NGOs and people's movements in specific, often highly-charged political settings. Twenty years ago, following the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, the politics of sustainable development were downplayed. At that time, the widely-accepted Brundtland definition of sustainable development (\"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\") valued equity in general, but paid little attention to particular, distinct needs and values. Throughout the 1990s, doing sustainable development often meant using approaches, frameworks, audit systems and evaluation protocols that were apolitical. The simplistic managerialism of many initiatives that were labelled \"sustainable development\" left many hopes of Rio 1992 unfulfilled, while the tendency of businesses and governments to pursue almost anything in the name of \"sustainability\" discredited the term. In 2012, the stakes are too high for Rio+ 20 to go the same way. It is time to put the politics back in at all levels. We need to recapture sustainable development as a term that facilitates discussion of diverse goals and values. We need to foster inclusive, democratic debate \u2013 across south and north, among poor and rich \u2013 about which pathways to pursue and how. \"The future we want\" may not be one in which we all share all our sustainable development goals and values, but it can be one in which more of us have a say.",

      "bodyText": "Black and minority ethnic service users and carers are experiencing one of the largest increases in health inequalities and largest reductions in social mobility since the second world war, coupled with the biggest cuts in public expenditure by a government in a lifetime. Over the last 18 months, the Afiya Trust has been bombarded daily with news of cuts in the public funding of voluntary and statutory services supporting vulnerable groups. Many community organisations are being closed at short notice, along with frontline services for communities in need, such as lunch clubs, respite care, day centres and advocacy services. The trust submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for the period November 2011 to February 2012 to establish how many adult social services departments were conducting equality impact assessments when making cuts. Despite receiving responses from 118 local authorities (75% of all councils), our preliminary findings indicate that many adult social services departments do not collect data on the funding allocated to black and minority ethnic (BME) voluntary and community sector organisations or conduct equality impact assessments. It is also becoming clear that, where cuts are known, the overall figure runs into the millions. It is clear, from the initial findings of our research, that our communities are carrying a significant burden under the cuts. We have filmed and interviewed many carers and service users, including people with learning disabilities and mental health survivors, for our Living in the Margins campaign. Services for our carers have always been fragmented and patchy and often culturally inappropriate. The situation under the austerity measures is even more tenuous. The carers I speak to and support, who come from culturally diverse backgrounds, have lost confidence and are filled with fear for what the future holds, for them and those they care for. Many say that even their social workers, who are at the frontline of service delivery, are unable to keep up with the changing structures and eligibility criteria. This goes against the notion of the \"big society\" and affects the very people that are saving the nation billions of pounds in their caring roles. Ranjit Khatkar, chair of the Leicester and Leicestershire BME Carers Workers Network, is facing the prospect that the network may have to disband this year. There has been a steady decrease in the number of practitioners who can attend network meetings and help plan and support its activities, such as an annual event that gives BME carers invaluable information and much needed respite. Khatkar says that \"due to the cuts in their workforce, many workers have been unable to attend our network meetings and events. Most no longer have administrative support in their day jobs, which means that they have less time to participate.\" The network has been active since 1996 and has supported more than 27 local organisations. Workers have networked and acted as peer mentors, and that has benefited carers. Only five organisations participated in its last event in December last year. This situation is being replicated all around the country. Liz Kendall, shadow minister for care and older people, tells me: \"I am extremely concerned about the impact the government's cuts are having on organisations supporting BME communities in social care and health. The government is in complete denial about the care crisis we are facing.\" Kate Green, shadow minister for equalities, who supports our campaign, adds that \"some ethnic groups already suffer considerable health inequalities and cutting back on the services they rely on will just make the situation worse\". As well as our new campaign, the Afiya Trust is one of 52 major organisations representing older and disabled people as part of a Care and Support Alliance, which will lobby parliament to protest about the cuts. We will urge the government to ensure that the white paper on social care, due later in the spring, delivers a sustainable and lasting settlement on social care funding. Otherwise the already bleak present will become a Dickensian future. Nita Devabhai is a carer and the national network manager at the Afiya Trust This article is published by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "Thomas Aquinas's Aristotelian interpretation of natural law has shaped western law and politics, although it is a minor section in the Summa Theologiae (ST II.I.94). It belongs within a comprehensive account of four levels of law (ST II.I.90-104). Eternal law is incomprehensible to us, because it is the order upon which all other order depends. We cannot think outside the laws we think with. Divine law is revealed in scripture and is meaningful only to those who accept scriptural authority. Natural law is what we have in common. It refers to our rational capacity to discern general principles in the order of nature to enable us to flourish as a species in communities, given that by nature we are social animals. Today, we might say that it is in our DNA. Human law is the interpretation of natural law in different contexts (ST II.I.95-97). Like Aristotle, Aquinas believed that just laws relate to the species, so the collective good comes before the individual good \u2013 although in a just society, these are not in conflict. This means that law is not about individual morality, and individual vices should only be legislated against when they threaten harm to others. Unlike Aristotle, Aquinas believed that an informed conscience takes precedence over law. No individual should obey a law that he or she believes to be unjust, because laws that violate reason are not laws. Moreover, laws must have sufficient flexibility to be waived when necessary in the interests of the common good. Natural law supports different cultures and religions, but unjust societies are those whose laws violate natural law. Modern thinkers who appeal to natural law as a foundation for morality often lose sight of Aquinas's naturalism, presenting it as a transcendent rational capacity or divine command that overrides our natural instincts and desires. This manifests itself in the rationalist quest to conquer nature (now redounding on us in a looming environmental catastrophe), and in the Catholic church's attempt to use politics and law to impose its views on sexuality over and against changing social customs. Aquinas argues that laws should change to reflect customs (although custom cannot change natural or divine law). I'll focus on two issues relating to this in terms of a widening gulf between the Catholic hierarchy and modern culture, including many Catholics. Contraception: Aquinas believed that the sex act must be intended for procreation for the preservation of the species (ST II.II.153.2). He also believed that children need to be raised in a loving environment, and marriage is the proper context for this. But we now know that females are not always fertile, and sexual activity among animals seems to be less functional than he realised. The changing role of women is also a transformation in culture and custom that requires a radical rethinking of law and reproductive ethics. The prohibition of artificial birth control finds little support from this reading of natural law, particularly since it flies in the face of customary practice among many Catholics and non-Catholics. Homosexuality: once one accepts that non-procreative, loving sex is good, the argument from natural law against homosexuality becomes untenable. What remains central from a Thomist perspective is what it means to live well as a sexual creature whose relationships reflect the love of God and respect the dignity of the human made in the image of God. Natural law is our rational capacity to interpret the laws of nature in order to use our scientific knowledge well. It is still relevant, even if our science is very different from Aquinas's, as we see from debates about the ethical implications of the laws of evolution. The Darwinian eugenicists of the early 20th century were engaged in one kind of natural law deriving from evolutionary science, and debates on this blog about genetic altruism are another form of natural law. They follow Aquinas insofar as they express a desire to discern order and goodness rather than randomness and futility in what science reveals to us about nature. Evolutionary eugenics may be as rationally defensible as evolutionary altruism, so why do we think one is bad and the other is good? Aquinas would have said because one respects the dignity of the human made in the image of God and the other violates it, but without that perspective, the answer is less clear. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

This is a great dish to make for a dinner party as it can all be prepared ahead of time and kept in the fridge until needed.

In a large saucepan, saut\u00e9 the onions, celery and garlic until soft and lightly caramelised, add the wine and reduce by half. Add the stock and reserved venison juices, bring to a boil and skim off any scum or oil that rises to the surface. Lower the heat and add the bay, thyme and venison, and simmer for two to four hours, until tender \u2013 the cooking time will vary hugely depending upon the age of the beast. The venison should be very tender, but not quite falling apart, as the stew will look much nicer if all the pieces of meat maintain their shape. Set aside to cool, then transfer to a plastic container and refrigerate until needed. When you're ready to cook the pies, use the pie pots (or pot) as templates for cutting out disc lids from the puff pastry, then divide the stew equally between the pie pots (or pot). On the underside of the pastry lids, paint a thin circle of beaten egg around the perimeter, then invert the lid on to the filled pots \u2013 the egg wash will enable the pastry to stick to the dish. Lightly press the pastry down into place, and make small decorative indentations around the edge of the pastry with a fork. Brush the lid with beaten egg, taking care that it does not run down the sides of the pastry because this will prevent the pastry from rising evenly, then refrigerate the pies until needed. To cook the pies, remove all the shelves from your oven apart from the bottom one \u2013 if you don't do this, the puff pastry will very likely hit the shelves above as it rises. Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, and bake the pies for 20 minutes, or until the pastry lids are golden brown (if it browns too quickly, place a piece of tinfoil over the top). For the mash, cook the vegetables separately in a steamer, or boil them. Very lightly mash together with a little butter, stir in the chopped parsley and season to taste. Keep warm in a large serving bowl until needed. To serve, remove the pies from oven and transfer the dishes to large dinner plates, held in place on a linen napkin.

      "bodyText": "The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, has confirmed that the government is considering watering down plans to abolish child benefit for middle class families. Clegg said the government was looking at the \"unintended consequences\" of the scheme but insisted the principle of asking people at the top to pay more would remain. Under the current plans \u2013 due to come into force next year \u2013 households in which one parent earns more than \u00a342,475 a year will lose all their child benefit, but a family with two working parents earning a combined \u00a380,000 will keep it if neither pays higher rate tax. Critics say the measure penalises single-parent families and couples where one parent stays at home. Clegg declined to discuss any specifics of the alterations being considered, but there has been speculation that the changes could involve lifting the threshold to \u00a350,000. He told Sky News Sunrise: \"The chancellor will announce the budget \u2013 obviously we're still working away at it in the government so it would be silly of me to start pronouncing now before everything is really decided. \"But I think we have been very open as a government that it is right that people at the top who earn much more than people with average incomes should be asked to make an extra sacrifice and that it is justifiable to say that people at the top don't receive child benefit in the way people do on ordinary incomes. \"But we're also equally accepting that there's also an issue about how you do that so you make sure you don't create unintended consequences where, say, a family with one earner gets child benefit removal when there's another family with income earners who actually collectively earn more but keep the benefit.\" The concession is seen as an attempt by the chancellor, George Osborne, to stave off a Tory backlash before a Labour-led debate in the Commons on Monday. Clegg made it clear that his own priority was to take low earners out of tax altogether, saying: \"I've been very clear about my overwhelming \u2026 priority, and that is to give tax cuts to the vast majority of taxpayers on low incomes and on ordinary incomes by raising the point at which they start paying income tax. \"It's the vast majority of people who I believe deserve a tax break, because times are tough.\" Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said Osborne should also act to reverse changes to tax credit eligibility for low-income families. \"What happened on child benefit was really unfair, to hit families in that particular way so badly,\" he told ITV's Daybreak. \"But on tax credits \u2026 for families on \u00a317,000, he is saying unless you can work a lot more hours, we will take away \u00a33,000 \u2013 it actually makes it better off to be out of work. That is really, really perverse. That is partly why unemployment is going up and he is not getting the deficit down. \"Stop this deep unfairness for low-income families. If they can move on child benefit for families on \u00a340,000, they should move on tax credits for families on half those incomes.\" Balls has claimed that working tax credits could be protected if the Treasury closed a stamp duty tax avoidance loophole on properties worth more than \u00a31m. Boris Johnson, the Conservative London mayor, used his Daily Telegraph column to highlight the way stamp duty loopholes were costing the Treasury a fortune. Johnson, who has previously focused his sights on calling for the 50p top rate of tax to be axed, condemned the \"scandal\" of the very rich \"who have come up with all sorts of cunning schemes to avoid paying stamp duty on very posh houses\". \"Some people \u2013 mainly but not exclusively 'non-doms' \u2013 get around stamp duty by treating the house as a company,\" he wrote. \"They buy shares in the company, and therefore pay tax at 0.5% rather than at 5% for expensive homes. But there is an even larger group of people who are exploiting a loophole, and going for a (legal) dodge called subsale relief. \"The result is the same: through the agency of some clever lawyers, they avoid a tax that is paid by virtually everyone else. According to a leading tax accountant, this loophole is being ever more ruthlessly exploited, and the loss to the Treasury could easily now be a billion pounds. It is time that it was closed.\"",

If they can move on child benefit for families on \u00a340,000, they should move on tax credits for families on half those incomes.\"</p> <p>Balls has claimed that working tax credits could be protected if the Treasury closed a stamp duty tax avoidance loophole on properties worth more than \u00a31m.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, the Conservative London mayor, used his <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9122818/A-billion-reasons-to-close-the-stamp-duty-loophole.html\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph column</a> to highlight the way stamp duty loopholes were costing the Treasury a fortune.</p> <p>Johnson, who has previously focused his sights on calling for the 50p top rate of tax to be axed, condemned the \"scandal\" of the very rich \"who have come up with all sorts of cunning schemes to avoid paying stamp duty on very posh houses\".</p> <p>\"Some people \u2013 mainly but not exclusively 'non-doms' \u2013 get around stamp duty by treating the house as a company,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"They buy shares in the company, and therefore pay tax at 0.5% rather than at 5% for expensive homes. But there is an even larger group of people who are exploiting a loophole, and going for a (legal) dodge called subsale relief.</p> <p>\"The result is the same: through the agency of some clever lawyers, they avoid a tax that is paid by virtually everyone else. According to a leading tax accountant, this loophole is being ever more ruthlessly exploited, and the loss to the Treasury could easily now be a billion pounds. It is time that it was closed.\"</p>",

But then private equity business Vista Partners revealed it had made an approach to Misys, potentially scuppering the Temenos arrangement.

Jeffrey Ubben of ValueAct said: The proposed Misys and Temenos all share merger has strategic logic but after further consideration we have decided to evaluate whether we can make an alternative proposal that provides the certainty of cash upon completion.

      "bodyText": "Two thirds of you reading this article will be women. Where are you reading it right now? If you're in an arts office, look around you \u2013 can you see more women than men at work? Do you think those women are getting paid less than the men? My recent foray into the statistics on women working in the arts would suggest that this is probable. And there was me hoping that our egalitarian arts world was immune to the rest of the working world's gender pay differentials \u2013 we speak a lot about access and barriers in this sector, but have we not overcome the gender barrier yet? It was Kira Cochrane's Guardian article on women in the media that got me digging deeper into the subject. There's a common observation that it's women who 'do' the arts managing, directed by male decision-makers. But is it true? The first problem I came up against was the scant information available on women in the arts workforce. The second was that data collected often merged female arts practitioners with arts managers, or bundled in the more overtly commercial sectors of the creative industries such as film, publishing and advertising, skewing the figures. That aside, what I did find made for a fascinating read. a-n's Making a Living as an Artist report found that the mean annual pay for men in the arts is \u00a323,492, and for women \u00a319,344. Not only are both levels pitifully low, but they're far from equal. Creative Blueprint found the same \u2013 in cultural heritage for example, 70% of women earn less than \u00a320,000 compared to 57% of men, with 11% of women earning more than \u00a329,000, compared to 26% of men. Arts Council England's NPO Equality Impact Assessment also shows the percentage of women employed drops the further up the pay scale you go. Research agreed that women are not only more qualified than men in the arts, but their overall numbers are increasing. However, Clore's Women in leadership in the creative and cultural sector report finds 2.5 male leaders to every female leader and that women are outnumbered by men in the most senior roles. And of those leading women only 75% want to stay in their roles, compared to 100% of leading men. Of the Guardian Culture Professionals readership, 22.3% of male respondents are at director/CEO level, compared to 12.4% of female respondents, with women holding more managerial roles than men (33% vs 22.2%). These headline findings inevitably lead to many questions. Firstly, pay. Do female practitioners earn less than men because they don't have the same confidence to charge more? Anecdotally, women don't ask for pay rises as men do \u2013 could the same be applied when it comes to pricing work, or is the art market not awarding the same financial value to female works? Are female management freelancers charging a lower daily rate? If they are, do they know they are, and who is going to tell them? Do women chase a different reward than a larger pay packet? Secondly, career progression. Are women working more laterally? Is the vertical career trajectory not for us? Do women exert influence from a different place to men \u2013 via networks, social media, by working in support roles, by reaching a level in our career they are happy with and playing to our strengths from that position? It might be the case that women want to work in a different way to men or that they're better suited to certain roles rather than others. Or this might be masking a darker gender politic. Does it matter that reports have merged the practitioner with the manager? It's a fact of many an artist's career that an administration job will run alongside their practice, but are there distinct issues that emerge from both these roles that are obscured by their amalgamation? Sometimes I wonder where the men I met at the foot of the arts career ladder have got to in subsequent years as I don't see them in the middle bracket; rather they seem to leapfrog to the top. It could be that the family-starting career break, common to many women, is to blame, and that men use this time to overtake women. Perhaps those women returning to the workforce at the same career level are effectively giving men a leg up. Not all women have children, of course, and some might have a work/life balance that allows equal childcare with a partner or full time work \u2013 there's no family break argument in these scenarios. We're working in changing times and we must ask ourselves what the inevitable cuts to the arts workforce mean for its female cohort. Reduced hours might finally give meaning to flexible working for those with families or dual careers, and if there is stagnation in the job market due to redundancy or decreasing opportunities, I wonder if it will address the imbalance. Thirdly, leadership. Why do women leaders not want to stay in a leadership role? What's not working for them? Do leading in the wings of the arts, or at the delivery end, mean that women in fact have greater reach and impact? ACE's What is the Creative Case for diversity? report includes women as one of its minority groups targeted for special attention. As a result of its research, Skillset decided to focus its training bursaries and masterclass programme on women. We have Clore supporting women arts leaders, but whom else? And how safe are such schemes with today's budget reductions? Skillset has created a list of industry commitments to \"redress the imbalances between men and women\" \u2013 a similar pro-women manifesto for the arts is a possibility. It's 2012 and the arts sector is apparently no different to any other when it comes to how it treats women. Yes, I'm playing devil's advocate with those questions and no, I'm not comfortable with attributing any of the differentials in the arts sector to gender determinism or homogenisation. But if we are to achieve gender equality in the arts then we all share a responsibility to make it happen. To do so, we need to get to the bottom of these apparent differences. My final question then: how do we do this?

      "bodyText": "Chelsea have come under fire from both the League Managers' Association chief executive, Richard Bevan, and their former manager Luiz Felipe Scolari following the decision to sack Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas after only 256 days in charge. Roman Abramovich was today searching for his eighth manager since taking control at Stamford Bridge in 2003, and while Bevan claimed the club is becoming an \"embarrassment\" to the Premier League, Scolari warned it would be \"hell\" for whoever Abramovich appointed next. Scolari, who like Villas-Boas was dismissed by Chelsea following reports of a dressing-room revolt, said: \"England has clubs like Arsenal, where Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has been for several years, yet has won only two or three championships. Chelsea's culture is very different, but this move is strange \u2013 although it's not so strange to me because of what I went through there. \"Some things are known, like the relations with the owner, who has the relationship with some players before the coach. Villas-Boas was a champion and he will continue to be. He needed to replace at least seven or eight players, even since I was there, but he failed. It will be hell for whoever succeeds him.\" Meanwhile Bevan told Radio 5 Live: \"What's for sure is the club, despite unlimited wealth, haven't yet worked out how to build a successful football club. Looking for what is an eighth manager in nine years is a serious embarrassment to the owner, the club, the fans and the league.\" The assistant first-team coach, Roberto Di Matteo, has been put in charge on an interim basis until the end of the season, and Bevan added: \"He [Villas-Boas] was very disappointed, frustrated, saddened, but his thoughts were for the club, the fans and indeed Roberto Di Matteo, wishing him well for the rest of the season. He's obviously a man who played six years or so for the club and has got good managerial experience with West Brom in the Premier League.\" Bevan claimed the frequent managerial changes at Stamford Bridge did not help Villas-Boas develop a relationship with the squad. \"Players need to know that the manager's strategy and his job is not in question, there's a clear remit,\" he said. \"You get success if you get time, and stability will come from that. Otherwise it's very difficult for a manager like Andr\u00e9 to impose his philosophy and build a team.\" Villas-Boas had the lowest win percentage of any Chelsea manager since Glenn Hoddle, but Bevan believes the results would have turned around: \"After only eight months you can't build that sort of success. The club's still competing in the latter stages of the Champions League, the FA Cup and fighting for a top-four position. If you want success you must look at the longer term.\" The Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, also accused Chelsea of not affording Villas-Boas enough time to see his vision through. \"All I can say is I feel sorry for Villas-Boas because I know him and I like him as a manager and as a man,\" Wenger said. \"I am sorry he was not given enough time to do his job. You cannot say that it's an impossible job. Our job is difficult because we face multiple opinions every day and we need as well to have the strength to push our own opinions through, and many times despite big resistance. But I'm sure that Villas-Boas had the strength to do that but when you're not given time you have no chance.\"",

It's hard to resist the temptation to have a peek at the virtual lives of others when a wealth of personal information can be accessed within seconds. But when our social bubble expands to involve our careers, Facebook stalking doesn't seem like such an carefree form of procrastination. With companies increasingly using social networking sites to check out potential employees, students are becoming more aware of the image projected by their online activity. With the prospect of being released into the working world fast approaching, some of my friends have resorted to changing their profile names in an effort to keep their personal lives hidden. They aren't the kind of people who post explicit photographs, express extreme views, or exchange dubious jokes. So why are they feeling pressurised to conceal their identity? Well, because companies really do reject candidates based on what Google reveals. A survey conducted by CareerBuilder found that the top reason employers reject candidates is for posting inappropriate photographs. Next on the list? Hosting content about alcohol or drug use. Clearly boasting about how many pints you downed last night isn't the wisest idea, but it seems even the most conscientious Facebook user could find themselves misjudged by a page they \"liked\" years ago. With so many graduates chasing so few jobs, it's understandable that companies need to find ways to filter applications. So is it time to get rid of those potentially self-defamatory photos from freshers' week? Well, perhaps not. A recent US study claims that Facebook users with a lot of friends \u2013 and even some partying photos \u2013 possess the jobworthy traits of being extroverted and friendly. And its findings, it says, are born out by how well the Facebook funsters perform at work. Don Kluemper, professor of management at North Illinois University and leader of the study, says: \"In five or 10 minutes, our raters could look at the tone of a subject's wall post, note the number of friends they have, peruse their photos to see how social they were and assess their tastes in books and music. It's a very rich source of information.\" But rich source of information or not, scanning Facebook profiles can't be the most effective way to decide how successfully a candidate will perform in the workplace. The student who once participated in a pub-crawl dressed as a cowboy may also read extensively, volunteer at weekends, and possess a multitude of desirable traits that can't be gleaned from his profile pictures. Ultimately, social networking sites are just that \u2013 social. Employers approaching them need to be aware that taking jokes out of context or viewing photos with an over-critical eye can lead to judgments that aren't representative of the whole individual. So why not steer clear of Facebook and assess candidates the tried-and-tested way: on how they come across in a professional context.",

      "bodyText": "The most important thing to realise about Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2012 is that it's not a game. It's firmly aimed at people who want to exercise, so (unsurprisingly) I wouldn't recommend it if that's not on your agenda. It's not designed for having fun with your friends at parties, or for playing alone \u2013 it's designed for training, not for play. The imaginatively-titled successor to Your Shape: Fitness Evolved, it's an expanded, polished fitness experience that makes good use of the Kinect's capabilities. The tracking for the most part is superb, the product is bright and fresh, and it does what it can to offer a personalised training solution for people who just need a quick home exercise programme with buckets of motivational incentives attached. From the home screen, you're given a wide choice of activities. A substantial amount of effort has gone into designing a comprehensive series of exercise routines to work different areas of the body, including some vital floor exercises. The routines let you target abs, legs, arms and so on with varying levels of intensity, but the Kinect does occasionally get a little confused about where you are on the floor exercises \u2013 especially to begin with, because you'll have to keep turning your head to check your form on the screen. Then there are series of interesting classes to get you doing various kinds of dance \u2013 Latin, Bollywood, hip hop and so on \u2013 as well as cardio boxing and yoga. Though the exercises start out fairly simple and limited, the exercises progress to get you to learn the moves, string them together and speed them up, though the limitations of the Kinect and the follow-my-leader approach mean you're unlikely to reach fluency using Your Shape alone. There are also short running-on-the-spot exercises that have your avatar running through minimalist, deconstructed versions of London and New York, giving you short intense burst challenges and distracting you with information about your virtual surroundings. They're good if you're the sort of person who doesn't fancy going for a run \u2013 or if it's freezing cold and chucking it down outside \u2013 but the shine quickly wears off and they don't feel like they've been designed for repeated or long-term play. For the most part, the activities don't come with much pretense at gameplay. Instead, they come with cheery coaching from trainers, regular state changes so you don't get too bored doing the same things over and over again, and buckets of good form rewards, medals, points, achievements, encouragement and reinforcement. This is gamified exercise, not gaming \u2013 which is fine, if you find these sorts of rewards motivating \u2013 and it's a very, very slick implementation. Having said that, there are a few entertaining mini-games that bring some play into the experience. My personal favourite is Wall Breaker, a simple block breaker where you use your fists and legs to smash bricks that appear on the screen, and twist to dodge the occasional mine. It's no coincidence that this is by far the activity I've done the most \u2013 it's well designed, responsive and intuitive, and it's possible to get into a genuine flow state, anticipating where the next block will appear and moving to intercept. It's fun, and it'd still be fun if I hated exercise and didn't care about achievements. Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2012 isn't a replacement for a serious exercise routine. If you just want to move around for a few more minutes each day, it's a useful aid to help you do so \u2013 but if you want to seriously build strength or lose weight, this isn't going to give you the support you need. You can set up exercise goals when you first log in, working towards one of several frustratingly vague options, whereupon the game will recommend time goals, calorie goals and some exercises for you to focus on. But exercises you do in other areas won't count at all towards your goals. You can do one or two things over and over in order to score your points, so it's very easy to avoid a balanced routine. And Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2012 doesn't provide any detailed information about how to seriously get fit, stay healthy, lose weight or build muscle, so there's nothing within the game to explain why that imbalance might be a bad idea. The biggest issue I had with the game \u2013 from both a health and a gaming perspective \u2013 is the points system, which uses an estimate of calories burned. At the most basic level, this means that if your goal is to increase flexibility and energy levels with yoga, the system feels unbalanced \u2013 you can be working very hard at a personal level, but the game's extrinsic motivation just doesn't match up. At a deeper level, cheery instructors telling me to \"bash those nasty calories away\" at the end of an exercise just doesn't feel right. If you're exercising to lose weight, maybe that makes sense (though if you've only burned six calories in a two-minute stretching exercise, it feels unnecessary). If you're exercising to build muscle or strength, there are times when you should be eating more, not less, food \u2013 so demonising calories is counterproductive. Either way, diet makes a much bigger difference to fat loss than exercise does \u2013 and once again, the game alone doesn't give you the information you need to understand that. So \u2013 if you want something simple and light that'll work around a busy schedule, it's great. As home fitness products go, it's certainly one of the best. It's absorbing, interesting and fun in parts, and if you're the sort of person who gets a kick out of medals, points and progress reports then you'll certainly enjoy the framework it offers. But if you're looking for a fun Kinect game with a getting-fit side-effect, or a comprehensive exercise routine with serious results, Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 is not quite there. \u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360",

It's absorbing, interesting and fun in parts, and if you're the sort of person who gets a kick out of medals, points and progress reports then you'll certainly enjoy the framework it offers. But if you're looking for a fun Kinect game with a getting-fit side-effect, or a comprehensive exercise routine with serious results, Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 is not quite there.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "BP's weekend $7.8bn (\u00a35bn) settlement relating to the Gulf of Mexico disaster has helped push the oil giant's shares sharply higher. Despite concerns that there were still details of the deal, which involves 110,000 private claims, to be worked out, BP is 9.7p better at 506.2p. Analyst Stuart Joyner at Investec said: In perhaps the most positive single development post the Macondo spill, BP agreed a settlement with the plaintiffs' steering committee at the weekend which, at $7.8bn, is below most market estimates, and does not increase the $37.2bn provision. Whilst uncertainty remains, it is diminishing and fast. Our target price [of 595p] includes a pre-tax deduction of $42bn for the net cost of Macondo to BP. Peter Hutton at RBC Capital Markets was also positive: We regard the proposed deal as a significant step in the process towards wider settlements on Macondo, and a pragmatic solution which further delays trial, accesses funds in the GCCF (Gulf Coast Compensation Facility) and provides a less contentious route for potential recovery from Halliburton and Transocean so funds do not go directly to BP. It was also helped by news that Iraq's oil minister said he was studying offers from international oil companies, including BP and Schlumberger, to develop the Kirkuk field in the north of the country. But despite BP's gains, the overall market has lost ground again, on worries about a possible Greek default if it does not reach a deal with its private bondholders. News that China has cut its growth targets has also helped send the FTSE 100 down 36.36 points to 5874.77. The Chinese news has hit mining shares, given the importance of the country for commodity companies. Kazakhmys, which unveiled disappointing figures last week, is down 24.5p at 975.5p while Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation has fallen 17.5p to 681.5p. The biggest riser in the leading index is Intertek, up 60p to \u00a323.74 after the testing company reported a 23% rise in full year profits.",

      "bodyText": "Member states of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) begin a week-long meeting today focused on the debate over Iran's nuclear programme, at a time when it threatens to become the casus belli in a new Middle East war. A day after President Obama told the main American Jewish lobby it was time for a pause in the near constant sabre-rattling of recent months while stressing that the US would use force if it deems it necessary, the outcome of the IAEA board of governors meeting will help set the tone for the next few tense months. The quarterly meeting at the agency headquarters in Vienna will also assess nuclear issues in Syria and North Korea as well as performing some IAEA housekeeping duties, but the gorilla in the boardroom today and for most of the week will be the report by the agency's director general, Yukiya Amano, on Iran's compliance or lack thereof. That report, which leaked some days ago, follows a visit to Tehran by a team of IAEA officials last month, which did not go well. The team went to Tehran for the second time in less than a month in search of answers to questions the IAEA has on evidence, supplied by other member states and collected by its own experts, that suggests that Iran had a significant weapons design programme in the past, and may have continued experimentation in low-key ways, like computer modelling, in recent years. Although Tehran had signalled that it was ready to discuss the IAEA's concerns, the agency team, led by the deputy director general, Herman Nackaerts, made no real progress over the course of the two visits. Nackaerts asked to go to Parchin, where the IAEA wants to investigate satellite imagery of a large steel vessel being installed in 2000 of a sort which could be used for explosive testing of warhead components. But the request was turned down on the grounds that Parchin was a military site and it takes more time to get permission. Nackaerts team also wanted to find out about the activities of Vyacheslav Danilenko, a Ukrainian-born scientist who worked in the Soviet weapons programme and who lectured in Iran from 1996 to 2002. Danilenko, who is referred to in IAEA reports simply as 'the foreign expert', told the agency that he was helping the Iranians make nano-diamonds using the same implosion techniques employed in nuclear warheads. The inspectors wanted to see some of the fruits of his labours and interview some of his students but were told that no such materials or personnel were available. The Nackaerts team also asked for a Iranian statement on the evidence of possible military dimensions of the country's nuclear programme, but only received a blunt point-by-point rebuttal of the 65 concerns the agency raised in its last report, in November last year. In previous discussions, Iranian officials acknowledged having carried out some of the experimentation mentioned by the IAEA but insisted it was for non-nuclear purposes. This time, Tehran rejected every scrap of evidence as a fabrication. At the same time, the IAEA found that Iran had tripled its rate of production of 20%-enriched uranium, and is doing much of it in a heavily-protected site dug under a mountain at Fordow. That is a matter of concern as it is much easier to turn 20% uranium into weapons-grade (90%-enriched) uranium, should the Iranians choose to go down that route, that it is with 3.5% uranium - the kind used in nuclear power reactors that Iran has been producing until recently. Iran says the 20% material is intended for use in its research reactor. The inspectors pointed out that the country already had more than enough for use in its research reactor in Tehran for the production of medical isotopes, but the Iranians claimed they were going to build five such reactors. Furthermore, the IAEA discovered that in the three months since the last report, Iran had dramatically accelerated its installation of centrifuges, bringing 2,600 more into production. Washington, London and Paris are hoping that these developments, in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, will be enough to persuade Russia and China to agree to Iran's referral to the council once more for further punitive sanctions. However, there are reasons to believe that will be a hard sell in Vienna this week. The freshly re-elected Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on the day the IAEA report was leaked that he suspected the nuclear issue was being used as a vehicle for 'regime change' in Iran. Moreover, there is a 'glass-half-full' interpretation of the new IAEA report, that suggests that the Iranian programme is not progressing quite as fast as Tehran's boasts and Israel's claims suggest. The thousands of centrifuges Iran has newly installed are all early model IR-1's, using technology that is half a century old. It is clear from the report that Iranian efforts to develop more advanced centrifuges that could enrich uranium much faster, have so far been a failure. As one Vienna-based diplomat familiar with the IAEA investigation said: \"They have been working for years on IR-2 and IR-4's and they have not yet run a full cascade [an array of 164 centrifuges] with these second-generation centrifuges, or at least not for a long time.\" Iranian claims to the IAEA that it would soon be testing IR-5's and IR-6's \"is another way of saying that its IR-2's and IR-4's haven't worked\", another diplomat said. Reports published before the IAEA Tehran visit, suggesting that Iran would imminently install new generation centrifuges at the underground site of Fordow - cited as a 'red line' by some Israeli officials - turned out to be groundless. All the centrifuges at Fordow are clunky old IR-1's. Furthermore, Iran's centrifuge development appears to have been fast but not deep. Some 2,600 new centrifuges have quickly been brought on-stream at the main enrichment centre in Natanz, and are being fed with uranium hexafluoride gas, but as an analysis by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) suggests, they are not working particularly well. And while more than 6,000 centrifuge casings have been installed at Natanz, it is far from clear that Iran has sufficient materials to put the working parts in those casings in the near future. In short, there is evidence of a rush by the Iranian authorities to create facts on the ground that make it look like they have achieved more than is actually the case. This may reflect the urgency of harried technicians trying to keep up with the pre-election boasts of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but it may also be an attempt to establish a strong bargaining position in anticipation of serious negotiations. The regime has said it is ready for new talks, although a time and a venue have yet to be agreed. So while the IAEA board will convene today to consider an Iranian regime that is clearly intransigent and defiant, the Russian, Chinese and non-aligned countries will have plenty of material to point to in support of their arguments that there is still time for diplomacy and that the agency should refrain from taking dramatic actions that could be interpreted as a trigger for war.",

      "bodyText": "The government's call for local communities to be put in the driving seat of regeneration should overcome previous criticism of major renewal schemes. But which of the multiple communities in any given area should be steering that process? And, crucially, what happens if central government does not like the route they choose? For some communities, financial exclusion, unemployment and urban decline have existed for far longer than the latest economic downturn. These areas have been the focus of regeneration schemes for decades, with successive generations promised hope in the form of a new idea or approach. The Building and Social Housing Foundation's report, Delivering effective regeneration, analyses the impact of the Bridging Newcastle Gateshead, a housing market renewal pathfinder that closed in April 2010, and the lessons that we can learn from it. The research draws on interviews with many groups involved in the programme, focusing on local people affected by the changes. As we look back on housing market renewal, one clear message to emerge is the need to listen to the local community, to understand their views and aspirations. Describing the pathfinder's approach, one community worker from Walker Riverside commented: \"There was one bit missing in [the] analysis and that was how the community sees themselves \u2013 the personality and character of Walker \u2013 that should underpin the vision for Walker Riverside.\" Interviews with residents demonstrated that there was a strong and shared vision for their community, and a real appetite for regeneration. But they wanted regeneration on their terms: a renaissance for their community that they understood and actively desired. By contrast, Bridging Newcastle Gateshead was criticised for placing the needs of future communities above those already living in the area. These future residents were often better-off middle-class groups, apparently seen to have a beneficial impact on the area simply by moving in. This model of gentrification failed to take into account the needs and aspirations of the working-class communities that may find themselves displaced. With market renewal now dead and buried, what is the future of regeneration? The government has set out its vision for a local approach, but there is little clarity as to what this will look like. The aspiration is to put \"residents, local businesses, civil society organisations and civic leaders in the driving seat\". The aim is to address the problems outlined above, regenerating communities on their terms. But as we have seen from the progress of localism so far, things are rarely that simple. Our study reveals highlights two issues. The first is defining which groups are supposed to be this designated driving seat. In any area, there will groups with competing priorities. Without a clear definition of the ultimate goal, it will not be possible to tailor schemes to different communities and assess the extent to which they benefit from local regeneration. The second issue arises when the national policymakers disagree with the aspirations of the communities undergoing regeneration. There is often a marked difference between the problems described by local communities and those set by policy wonks and regeneration experts. If the government is committed to pursuing localism, an approach that truly puts local people \"in the driving seat\", then it must clarify what will happen when the aspirations of communities are at odds with national priorities. Localism, at least in theory, has the potential to overcome one of the biggest criticisms of housing market renewal: the failure to listen. If this vision is to be realised, then there is still much to work to be done in working with local residents.

      "bodyText": "A quarter of Londoners live in private rented homes, but mayor Boris Johnson doesn't spend a quarter of his time on housing improving their lot. The London Assembly's planning and housing committee recently conducted an investigation into poor housing conditions in the private rented sector, and I was surprised at some of the arguments that were put forward against reform. I've set out some of the more wrongheaded arguments here, and I'm interested in hearing your views. 1. People are choosing to rent privately The mayor describes private renting as \"the first choice\" for people who move to London, but for most it's their only option \u2013 and far from their favourite. The Hills review found that 72% of private tenants would rather own their own home, while only 8% would continue renting privately as their first choice. Other research suggests that many more people might prefer to rent if the sector guaranteed a decent home, security and stability, and freedom to change and improve their home, the guarantees that social tenants and home owners enjoy. 2. Most private tenants are happy with their home The government likes to cite a very general statistic, that 85% of private renters are satisfied with their accommodation. But the British Social Attitudes survey looked at this issue in more depth, and found that only a third of private tenants thought they usually enjoy a good standard of housing, compared to almost two thirds of housing association tenants and over half of council tenants. 3. Tenants like the flexibility One of the government's two cited benefits for private renting is flexibility, which is undoubtedly valued by many who choose not to buy. But you can give people longer and more secure tenancies and still have the flexibility to move at a couple of months' notice. With 28% of private tenant households across the UK in 2008 having children, it seems perverse to leave them exposed to the threat of eviction without cause every six months in the name of flexibility. 4. The sector offers affordability in London The other argument is that the sector is affordable for those who can't buy. But London's rents are twice the national average; the average income is only 40% more than the national average; and, the minimum wage is the same in the capital. Last year rents for new lettings rose between 6 and 14% while wages only rose 2%. In most London boroughs, the average rent takes up more than half the average income. Too many are trapped, unable to save for a deposit or to find a cheaper rented home. 5. It's just a problem of rogue landlords Rogue or slum landlords are undoubtedly the most urgent problem to tackle, but the London Assembly heard that poor conditions, inflation-busting rent rises and a lack of security commonly affect tenants across the board \u2013 rich and poor. Landlords' organisations also recognise the problems faced by well meaning but ill informed landlords, who are often reluctantly renting because they can't sell their home. 6. Landlords don't want tenancy reform The Rugg review found that landlords often favour longer tenancies, but that the short insecure tenancies are favoured because of the risk of bad tenants not paying rent or damaging the home. Lettings agents have also called for more regulation. Smart reform that favoured responsible tenants and responsible landlords would surely be better for London than keeping the status quo just because of a few rogue tenants? 7. Any tenancy reforms would be harmful Housing minister Grant Shapps has said any extra regulation \"would have pushed up rents and reduced choice\". But other European countries where more people rent all offer longer, more secure tenancies with more affordable rents in a more carefully regulated sector. The London mayor also often points to the decline in private renting following the introduction of rent controls \u2013 but fails to mention that people were moving into the millions of new council homes or buying a home with tax relief. The Irish government introduced smart reforms in 2004, including more secure tenancies and the right for tenants who have lived in their home for 6 months to stay for another 3.5 years. 8. Costs are driven up by benefits Ministers have tried to turn private renters against each other by suggesting that housing benefits are driving rents up. This is total myth. Most recently, the pime minister claimed rents were falling as a result of the caps introduced in April 2011. But landlords and housing experts dismissed this claim, and a snap survey found that only one in 11 councils asked had negotiated lower rents as a result of the reforms. 9. Institutional investors will save the day The mayor has been pinning high hopes on pension funds and other institutional investors since early 2009. But they only supply small amounts of housing in other countries that lack our housing associations and council homes. Without grants or cheap land, they will offer the same high rents as everyone else, albeit probably with better quality homes and possibly a bit more security. But they aren't an excuse to leave the rest of the sector alone. 10. The only answer is build more Boris Johnson likes to tell me that \"we all agree\" on this one \u2013 but I don't. Of course we need to build more housing in London to cope with a growing population and a backlog of low delivery, but it isn't the only answer. It's also unlikely to work: we'd need to build 44,700 homes per year to stabilise prices, and the mayor's ambition is only for 32,210 per year. Even if that were possible, his sustainability advisors have cautioned that current building levels adopting the most green technology could still bust his climate change targets. Other possible answers could include smart reforms of tenancies, landlords, letting and managing agents, and reforms to our taxation system, as the Assembly has recommended. So what do you think? The arguments here form the basis for my scrutiny of the mayor's housing strategy \u2013 and delivery on his promises.

      "bodyText": "The reporting of the Greek tragedy over the last couple of years gives the impression that economics is a master science. Yet, the mainstream economists who gave Lehman Brothers a certificate of rude health just before its collapse, predicted tat by 2012 the Greek economy would start growing. The economy shrank by 7% last year and a further 6% contraction is predicted for this year, with worse to come. This is the fastest slump in recent times. The discipline of this type of economics is often closer to a confidence trick than a science. Both Carl Schmitt and Hannah Arendt drew a dark picture of the times when economics trump politics. Has their prediction come to pass? The slow death of Greece was a political project from the start, with politicians accepting the prescriptions of neoliberal economics. The country has become the guinea pig for the future of a Europe ruled by German capital and Eurocrats. The economic measures were planned in Berlin and Brussels and are implemented in Athens by pliant politicians. They aim to reduce violently the standard of living of ordinary people, abolish the few remaining social safeguards and create third world working conditions. Greek politics, meanwhile, has become an experiment in how to bring about the collapse of a system of power. Opinion polls put the Greek Pasok party at around 10% \u2013 down from 44% in the last elections \u2013 and the New Democracy party, which has alternated with Pasok in government, at around 30%, with the three left parties, Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), Communists (KKE) and Democratic Left standing at over 40%. The popularity dive of Pasok and New Democracy is understandable: the sorry state of Greece is the result of their combined policies. For the last 40 years, the two parties inflated the public sector they now attack by giving jobs to clients and contracts to sponsors. They turned a blind eye to tax evasion and created the most generous system of tax avoidance for the rich. They ran up the deficit and the debt and continued doing so well after the problems became clear. Both parties in government altered the statistical returns of their predecessors, giving rise to the term \"Greek statistics\". Papandreou, after his 2009 victory, had the deficit increased \u2013 falsely, according to prosecutor Grigoris Peponis \u2013 by 3%, inviting the IMF-EU tutelage. The elites willed the deficit, the debt and their consequences and, if they could, they would have introduced the austerity measures without the intervention of the troika of IMF, EU and the European Central Bank. The wholesale destruction of the weak welfare state, the massive transfer of public assets to private hands at bargain basement prices, the largest internal devaluation since the 1930s and the loss of national independence are part of the necessary re-arrangement of capitalism for a period of low growth and popular militancy. The supposed \"rescue\" is a test run for a new type of predatory capitalism after the failure of growth through the financial bubble. The arrogance of Greek politicians made them unable, perhaps, to understand that by doing the bidding of their European partners, they would hasten their own political demise. George Papandreou, the only Greek prime minister ever to resign despite once having a strong parliamentary majority, was the third premier in his family and was appointed to his first ministerial post in 1985. The leader of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras also comes from a political family and became a minister in 1989. Many members of the current government are reaching what a mature democracy would consider political retirement age. The ploys used by the two parties to distance themselves from the unpopular measures while accepting them offer a textbook case of systemic and cynical panic. Let me list some. New Democracy, the official neoliberal party, voted against the first austerity package in order to improve its poll ratings. But when the EU, IMF and the European Right set as precondition for the second package that its leader, Antonis Samaras sign up, the party returned to form and joined the Papademos government. The right-wing nationalist LAOS party on the other hand supported the measures from the start until its ratings started plummeting. At that point, it abandoned the government and voted against the second package. But these somersaults cannot prevent the disintegration of the parties. Over 43 coalition MPs have defied their party's whip and have been expelled from their respective governmental parties. Five splinter parties have emerged so far and more are expected in the next few days. The appointment of the unelected banker Lucas Papademos to the premiership was aimed at capitalising on the prestige of mainstream economists, and reversing the distrust for politicians. When the Papademos government was formed last November, it was announced that elections would take place next April. Despite the bonus of 50 MPs the Greek electoral system awards the winners, it seems that no single party will have a working majority after the next elections. This unprecedented uncertainty has increased the anxiety of politicians, many of whom are asking for a postponement of the elections and the continuation of the unelected government. Once the politicians had failed in their efforts to convince people that the destruction of their lives was unavoidable, democracy itself became the target. Holding elections has now become the main problem for a government which, paraphrasing Bertold Brecht, would prefer to elect a new people. The postponement of elections following the earlier cancellation of a referendum on the euro by Merkel and Sarkozy is part of set of measures that have turned Greece into little more than a colony. The proposal that a commissioner should be appointed to run the Greek economy was more than a little insensitive for a country that has suffered a brutal Nazi occupation. The proposal was scrapped; instead, there is to be a task force of inspectors based in the main ministries and a special ring-fenced account where the loan money will be deposited beyond Greek control, to be used exclusively for repaying the loans. As in 2008, the European taxpayers are bailing out European banks, with Greece becoming a temporary stopping point. As if this was not enough, the prioritising of loan repayments over pensions and salaries will be inserted into the constitution, turning sectarian ideology into legal dogma for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Additionally, the two party leaders have signed a letter agreeing to pursue the austerity measures after the elections. Thus the most important issue in recent Greek history will not be open for debate or voting. Social democratic, Keynesian and socialist ideas have effectively been banned. This is one of those rare occasions where the distance between the public and mainstream politicians has become a chasm. The next few weeks will decide whether this is the final stage in the decay of democracy and independence, or whether a new politics will develop. Unfortunately, the parties of the Left still refuse to collaborate. SYRIZA promotes a broad anti-austerity front within Europe, but cannot convince the other two. The Greek Communist party, the most dogmatic in Europe, participates in parliamentary politics but is not interested in power unless it has full monopoly. The europhile Democratic Left prefers to act as a receptacle for disappointed Pasok voters. The Greek left, like the Conservative party, cannot overcome its deep trauma over Europe. But the Greek people who filled Syntagma and the other squares last year, practicing civil disobedience and direct democracy, have other options. The mainstream media present the political collapse as the end of the post-dictatorship regime, hoping that the politicians who brought Greece to its knees can engineer its reform. But the reality is different. Post-civil war Greece was founded on the exclusion and persecution of the Left, and this culminated in Colonel Papadopoulos's dictatorship. This divide is now coming to an end as both working people and modernisers realise that the political elite has betrayed them. For the first time, new types of political action are on the agenda. A hegemonic bloc combining the defence of the welfare state, democracy and national independence can bring together parts of the population who were historically on opposing sides but now express their indignation together. The necessary reform of the state, robust tax collection and punishment of the culprits can only succeed if undertaken by people who are not responsible for widespread corruption and mindless consumption. The task in hand is to rescue Greece from its \"rescuers\" and to create a new model for democracy in Europe.",

      "body": "<p>The reporting of the Greek tragedy over the last couple of years gives the impression that economics is a master science. Yet, the mainstream economists who gave Lehman Brothers a certificate of rude health just before its collapse, predicted tat by 2012 the Greek economy would start growing. The economy shrank by 7% last year and a further 6% contraction is predicted for this year, with worse to come. This is the <a href=\"http://www.thepressproject.gr/external.php?id=12731\" title=\"The Press Project: (Reuters) Analysis: Greece heads for record books as economy slumps\">fastest slump in recent times</a>. The discipline of this type of economics is often closer to a confidence trick than a science.</p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Schmitt\" title=\"Wikipedia: Carl Schmidt\">Carl Schmitt</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt\" title=\"Wikipedia: Hannah Arendt\">Hannah Arendt</a> drew a dark picture of the times when economics trump politics. Has their prediction come to pass? The slow death of Greece was a political project from the start, with politicians accepting the prescriptions of neoliberal economics. The country has become the guinea pig for the future of a Europe ruled by German capital and Eurocrats. The economic measures were planned in Berlin and Brussels and are implemented in Athens by pliant politicians. They aim to reduce violently the standard of living of ordinary people, abolish the few remaining social safeguards and create third world working conditions. Greek politics, meanwhile, has become an experiment in how to bring about the collapse of a system of power.</p> <p>Opinion polls put the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhellenic_Socialist_Movement\" title=\"Wikipedia: Panhellenic Socialist Movement\">Greek Pasok</a> party at around 10% \u2013 down from 44% in the last elections \u2013 and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democracy_%28Greece%29\" title=\"Wikipedia: New Democracy (Greece)\">New Democracy</a> party, which has alternated with Pasok in government, at around 30%, with the three left parties, Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), <a href=\"http://inter.kke.gr/\" title=\"KKE Communist Party of Greece: homepage\">Communists (KKE)</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Left_%28Greece%29\" title=\"Wikipedia: Democratic Left (Greece)\">Democratic Left</a> standing at over 40%. The popularity dive of Pasok and New Democracy is understandable: the sorry state of Greece is the result of their combined policies. For the last 40 years, the two parties inflated the public sector they now attack by giving jobs to clients and contracts to sponsors. They turned a blind eye to tax evasion and created the most generous system of tax avoidance for the rich. They ran up the deficit and the debt and continued doing so well after the problems became clear. Both parties in government altered the statistical returns of their predecessors, giving rise to the term \"Greek statistics\". Papandreou, after his 2009 victory, had the deficit increased \u2013 <a href=\"http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/01/20/greek-prosecutor-wants-papandreou-investigated/\" title=\"Greek Reporter: Greek Prosecutor Wants Papandreou Investigated\">falsely, according to prosecutor Grigoris Peponis</a> \u2013 by 3%, inviting the IMF-EU tutelage. The elites willed the deficit, the debt and their consequences and, if they could, they would have introduced the austerity measures without the intervention of the troika of IMF, EU and the European Central Bank.</p> <p>The wholesale destruction of the weak welfare state, the massive transfer of public assets to private hands at bargain basement prices, the largest internal devaluation since the 1930s and the loss of national independence are part of the necessary re-arrangement of capitalism for a period of low growth and popular militancy.

      "bodyText": "On a thrilling and potentially momentous day of golf it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Tiger Woods and Lee Westwood, who had just shot 62 and 63 respectively in the final round of the Honda Classic only to find themselves beaten by the better and younger man. Rory McIlroy is the new world No1 and the two warhorses will have to get used to it, although it seems this may take a while. \"He's a very good player, very young, still learning, got most of the shots. I think he's got a fairly bright future,\" the wry Englishman said of McIlroy's performance in winning the third US PGA event of his career. With that his well of superlatives rapidly dried up. \"I'm not going to talk about another player am I, when I have just shot 63.\" Woods, whose round of 62 was his lowest ever in the final round of a Tour event, was only marginally less grudging. \"You can't get to No1 in the world unless you're consistent, and he's won a few times here and there but he's been very, very consistent. That's what you have to do,\" the former world No1 said. To describe McIlroy's play over the last six months as \"consistent\" is like suggesting Picasso's blue period was \"half decent\". Faint praise is not what McIlroy deserves, although for the rest of us it does serve the useful purpose of shedding a little light on the innermost thoughts of those delivering it and who must now solve the puzzle of how to beat the new king. Could it be that Woods and Westwood are now a little intimidated? If so, they have good cause. The Northern Irishman's worst performance since last year's US PGA Championship at Atlanta, where he injured a wrist on the opening day, was a tie for 11th place at the Dubai World Championship in December. He was placed in 11 other tournaments: winning three times, finishing second four times and inside the top five in the remaining four events. That, to use a comparison from recent history, is the kind of thing Woods used to do in his prime. Still, if Woods himself was not in the mood to draw comparisons between himself and the schoolboy from Holywood who once considered the American to be his role model, there were plenty of others who were quick to see the parallels. Graeme McDowell led the charge. \"Rory is the best player I've ever seen tee to green, period. I didn't have a chance to play with Tiger in the early to mid 2000s, when Tiger was the man, but Rory McIlroy is the best player I've ever seen,\" the 2010 US Open champion said. McDowell has been talking about his young friend in such terms for a while now but like most observers he concedes there remain some deficiencies in McIlroy's game, in putting and in his ability to \"close out\" tournaments \u2014 two facets intertwined by the singularly elusive quality known as belief. McIlroy conceded after Sunday's victory he has more self-confidence than he once had. McDowell explained why. \"I think Rory has upped his intensity level both on and off the golf course. I see him working harder and I see him getting himself in great shape. I see him just kind of being a lot more single-minded and tunnel-visioned off the golf course. He knows what he wants to do now and he knows how to do it. It's pretty scary to see what he can do with a golf ball, you know, and he's now starting to kind of show it,\" he said. \"A couple of years ago there was probably a little question mark [about his putting] from inside six feet. His stroke was a little bit kind of lifty and across the line. The work he did with Dave Stockton last year has made a huge amount of difference, and now he believes he's a great putter. \"That was the missing link, because the rest of his game is all there. I think he has a huge amount more belief than he had two years ago. Yes, he was not a stand-out closer two years ago, because he didn't have the putting ability. Now he has the putting ability and he's starting to win regularly. Like we all knew he could.\" The new number No1 concurred on the subject of his putting, although he could do little else after a day in which his all-round short game was outstanding. Time and again during Sunday's final round he was able to salvage par in situations where sloppy approach play might have cost him a bogey. Good players are able to pull off the Houdini act most of the time. Great players do it virtually every time. Exceptional players, and there is no doubt McIlroy is an exceptional player, do it virtually all the time, even when they are under extreme pressure. \"It comes from practice and experience of maybe missing greens and experimenting with a few different shots. I felt like I got better out of the rough,\" he said of his marked improvement in chipping and putting. \"I think that's been part of the reason why I started to become so consistent is when I do miss greens I'm able to get it up and down and not make as many mistakes.\" After the victory McIlroy departed for New York, where he will spend Monday with his girlfriend, the tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, before heading back to Miami to prepare for this week's Cadillac Championship, the latest instalment of what is developing into a golfing season for the ages. Woods, buoyant from Sunday's round of 62, will be there. Westwood will be there, and so will Phil Mickelson, whose last two Tour appearances, a win at Pebble Beach and a close second place at Riviera Country Club, suggest the left-hander is once again as potent a player as he was in his prime. Throw in the likes of Luke Donald, who ceded the world No1 place to McIlroy, and Martin Kaymer, another former world No1 with his best years in front of him, and you have a bingo caller's nightmare \u2014 a full house \u2013 and a sponsor's dream come true; unmissable theatre. It promises to be quite a week in Miami; a Cadillac of a golf tournament, you could say, although it goes without saying the Rolls-Royce of these events is still parked in the garage. There is still a month to go before Augusta National opens its gates to the best in the world but already the expectation is palpable. \"I'm excited to be part of golf right now. The game is better than it's ever been,\" said McDowell, sentiments echoed across the spectrum \u2014 from the sideline cynics now in thrall, to the man at the fulcrum of this unfolding, unfathomable drama. \"I think [what is happening] is fantastic for the game. The more that we can create interest and get more people watching, it can only be good,\" said McIlroy. \"Seeing Phil [Mickelson] do what he did at Pebble; Tiger playing the way he did today; hopefully I'm in there somewhere, getting to No1. It's great for the game and I think everyone is excited for Augusta to roll around. I definitely know I am. Looking forward to getting back there and giving it another shot.\" The new world No1 is not alone in his anticipation. Let the waiting begin. It will be torture but it will be worth it in the end.",

That's what you have to do,\" the former world No1 said.</p> <p>To describe McIlroy's play over the last six months as \"consistent\" is like suggesting Picasso's blue period was \"half decent\". Faint praise is not what McIlroy deserves, although for the rest of us it does serve the useful purpose of shedding a little light on the innermost thoughts of those delivering it and who must now solve the puzzle of how to beat the new king. Could it be that Woods and Westwood are now a little intimidated?</p> <p>If so, they have good cause.</p> <p>The Northern Irishman's worst performance since last year's US PGA Championship at Atlanta, where he injured a wrist on the opening day, was a tie for 11th place at the Dubai World Championship in December. He was placed in 11 other tournaments: winning three times, finishing second four times and inside the top five in the remaining four events. That, to use a comparison from recent history, is the kind of thing Woods used to do in his prime.</p> <p>Still, if Woods himself was not in the mood to draw comparisons between himself and the schoolboy from Holywood who once considered the American to be his role model, there were plenty of others who were quick to see the parallels. Graeme McDowell led the charge. \"Rory is the best player I've ever seen tee to green, period. I didn't have a chance to play with Tiger in the early to mid 2000s, when Tiger was the man, but Rory McIlroy is the best player I've ever seen,\" the 2010 US Open champion said.</p> <p>McDowell has been talking about his young friend in such terms for a while now but like most observers he concedes there remain some deficiencies in McIlroy's game, in putting and in his ability to \"close out\" tournaments \u2014 two facets intertwined by the singularly elusive quality known as belief. McIlroy conceded after Sunday's victory he has more self-confidence than he once had. McDowell explained why.</p> <p>\"I think Rory has upped his intensity level both on and off the golf course. I see him working harder and I see him getting himself in great shape. I see him just kind of being a lot more single-minded and tunnel-visioned off the golf course. He knows what he wants to do now and he knows how to do it. It's pretty scary to see what he can do with a golf ball, you know, and he's now starting to kind of show it,\" he said.</p> <p>\"A couple of years ago there was probably a little question mark [about his putting] from inside six feet. His stroke was a little bit kind of lifty and across the line. The work he did with Dave Stockton last year has made a huge amount of difference, and now he believes he's a great putter.</p> <p>\"That was the missing link, because the rest of his game is all there. I think he has a huge amount more belief than he had two years ago. Yes, he was not a stand-out closer two years ago, because he didn't have the putting ability. Now he has the putting ability and he's starting to win regularly. Like we all knew he could.\"</p> <p>The new number No1 concurred on the subject of his putting, although he could do little else after a day in which his all-round short game was outstanding.</p> <p>Time and again during Sunday's final round he was able to salvage par in situations where sloppy approach play might have cost him a bogey. Good players are able to pull off the Houdini act most of the time. Great players do it virtually every time. Exceptional players, and there is no doubt McIlroy is an exceptional player, do it virtually all the time, even when they are under extreme pressure.</p> <p>\"It comes from practice and experience of maybe missing greens and experimenting with a few different shots. I felt like I got better out of the rough,\" he said of his marked improvement in chipping and putting.</p> <p>\"I think that's been part of the reason why I started to become so consistent is when I do miss greens I'm able to get it up and down and not make as many mistakes.\"</p> <p>After the victory McIlroy departed for New York, where he will spend Monday with his girlfriend, the tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, before heading back to Miami to prepare for this week's Cadillac Championship, the latest instalment of what is developing into a golfing season for the ages.</p> <p>Woods, buoyant from Sunday's round of 62, will be there. Westwood will be there, and so will Phil Mickelson, whose last two Tour appearances, a win at Pebble Beach and a close second place at Riviera Country Club, suggest the left-hander is once again as potent a player as he was in his prime.</p> <p>Throw in the likes of Luke Donald, who ceded the world No1 place to McIlroy, and Martin Kaymer, another former world No1 with his best years in front of him, and you have a bingo caller's nightmare \u2014 a full house \u2013 and a sponsor's dream come true; unmissable theatre.</p> <p>It promises to be quite a week in Miami; a Cadillac of a golf tournament, you could say, although it goes without saying the Rolls-Royce of these events is still parked in the garage. There is still a month to go before Augusta National opens its gates to the best in the world but already the expectation is palpable. \"I'm excited to be part of golf right now. The game is better than it's ever been,\" said McDowell, sentiments echoed across the spectrum \u2014 from the sideline cynics now in thrall, to the man at the fulcrum of this unfolding, unfathomable drama.</p> <p>\"I think [what is happening] is fantastic for the game. The more that we can create interest and get more people watching, it can only be good,\" said McIlroy. \"Seeing Phil [Mickelson] do what he did at Pebble; Tiger playing the way he did today; hopefully I'm in there somewhere, getting to No1. It's great for the game and I think everyone is excited for Augusta to roll around. I definitely know I am. Looking forward to getting back there and giving it another shot.\"</p> <p>The new world No1 is not alone in his anticipation. Let the waiting begin. It will be torture but it will be worth it in the end.</p>",

The only other candidate priced up at single-digit odds in the Next Permanent Chelsea Manager betting market is Roberto Di Matteo, the Italian installed as interim boss until the end of the season and a man the Sun reports is even more unpopular with Chelsea's players than his predecessor. \"He's just too cock-sure,\" an unnamed Chelsea source told the tabloid. \"They might unite behind him to start with but after a couple of bad results it will be just as bad, if not worse. It's a shambles from top to bottom. They just don't have a coach.\" Away from Stamford Bridge, Tottenham Hotspur are reported to be interested in signing the 21-year-old Blackburn \"contract rebel\" Junior Hoilett, whose ongoing refusal to ink a new deal at Ewood Park means he'll be available for a cut-price fee in June. Despite having scored just three goals this season for Rovers, Hoilett is also believed to be making loud pinging noises on the radar of Tottenham's north London rivals Arsenal, where the manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has provided a pep for Gooners and England fans alike by suggesting his injured midfielder Jack Wilshere could return to action before the end of the season. \"The last scan was good and he can start to jog again so he is on the way back, but we have to be very cautious with him,\" said Wenger of the 20-year-old, who is yet to feature for Arsenal this season having been sidelined with an ankle injury and a stress fracture to his heel. Sir Alex Ferguson is in the market for a centre-back and wants to bring Milan's centre-back Thiago Silva to Old Trafford and is ready to offer the Serie A side \u00a325m for their Brazilian international after reading very favourable reports from the surveillance team he's had monitoring Silva as he goes about his business at San Siro. According to Amy Lawrence, of this parish, the Montpelier striker Olivier Giroud is \"a tall, physically imposing player who is technically able\" who is \"currently the toast of France\", a state of affairs that could go some way towards explaining why Liverpool want to make him the toast of Anfield. Amy's opinions on Luke Varney are unrecorded, but the Portsmouth striker's five goals in 17 appearances may be enough to secure him a loan move from Fratton Park to Elland Road, where the Leeds United manager Neil Warnock is desperate to bolster a toothless attack that somehow failed to convert any of the 25,849 shots on goal they recorded in their 1-0 home defeat against the league leaders Southampton on Saturday evening.

      "bodyText": "Muslim women in the Australian state of New South Wales will be required to show their faces when they have documents witnessed under new identity check laws. The laws \u2013 due to come into force on 30 April \u2013 will apply to statutory declarations and affidavits and cover anything that conceals a person's face, including motorcycle helmets, masks, veils, burqas or niqabs. It follows a court case in which a woman wearing a burqa had a six-month jail sentence overturned on appeal last year because of doubts about her identity. Carnita Matthews, 47, was originally convicted of falsely accusing a police officer of trying to remove her burqa during a random breath test. The conviction was overturned on appeal because the woman who made the complaint was wearing a burqa, making it impossible to tell whether it was Matthews. Traffic laws were subsequently changed, and drivers who refuse to show their faces face being jailed for up to a year and fined $5,000 (\u00a33,400). The NSW state attorney general, Greg Smith, said the Matthews case highlighted the need for the rules to be clarified. \"If a person refuses to show their face, an authorised witness must decline to sign their documents unless the person has a legitimate medical reason for keeping their face covered,\" he added. \"In some situations, it means individuals wearing full or partial face-covering garments will need to reveal their faces for the purposes of identification.\" Witnesses who do not comply with the new requirements face a fine of $220. Smith said the more comprehensive identity checks would minimise the risk of fraud. Aziza Abdel-Halim, the president of the Muslim Women's National Network of Australia, said the change would not have an impact on the community. \"The majority will accept it,\" she said, adding that it is a requirement in many Muslim countries. \"Some will reject it, but they won't have a leg to stand on because the law is the law.\" Abdel-Halim said it was no different to being required to confirm your identity by showing your face if you are sitting an exam. David Bernie, the vice-president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, agreed, saying: \"I really don't think this should cause any problems as long as a woman has the opportunity for a female JP to witness documents, and there are plenty of female JPs and solicitors in NSW.\" There are around 90,000 justices of the peace in NSW who provide the service on a voluntary basis.",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal must not sell Van Persie Missed chances, a wasted penalty, great saves and a last-minute winner: it certainly sounds like an Arsenal game, only this time it was Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side carrying out the mugging for once. After becoming the first side to win at Liverpool in any competition this season, in rather fortunate circumstances, Wenger was perfectly happy to admit how lucky Arsenal were. \"We could have been two or three goals down at half-time,\" he said. They stayed in the game though, and if Arsenal can stay in a game, Robin van Persie can win them the game. Where Arsenal would be without the Dutchman hardly bears thinking about; as it is, despite the problems they have encountered all season, they now find themselves in the unlikely position of being the favourites to finish fourth \u2013 or even third \u2013 and qualify for the Champions League, Saturday's victory moving them 10 points clear of Liverpool. Given the various crises they have faced throughout the season, it would arguably rank as one of Wenger's finest achievements. He would not be able to carry it off without Van Persie, whose two goals at Anfield took his tally in the league to 25, which equates to 45.5 percent of Arsenal's goals. Liverpool have scored 30, Luis Su\u00e1rez only contributing six and Andy Carroll three. Between them, Fernando Torres, Daniel Sturridge and Didier Drogba have managed 13 for Chelsea. Only Newcastle have a striker who can rival Van Persie, and while they still harbour hopes of finishing fourth, they will be grateful if Demba Ba's 17 goals are enough to earn them Europa League football next season. What Arsenal's rivals would give to have Van Persie leading their attack. We may find out the answer to that this summer. Barely a day goes by without Van Persie being linked to Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid, which is understandable given the sales of Cesc F\u00e1bregas and Samir Nasri last summer. Their resolve will surely be tested again, but this time they must not break; instead, in the way that Tottenham resisted Chelsea's interest in Luka Modric, they have to convince Van Persie to extend his contract, which expires next summer. Always a classy player, Van Persie has become the complete striker, his first goal at Liverpool a fine header, his second a beautifully controlled volley in stoppage time. As Alex Song's chipped pass dropped towards Van Persie, there was no debate about it: you knew he was going to score. In a sense, considering Chelsea's implosion and the money wasted by Liverpool, Arsenal have got away with last summer's inertia. In another year, they would not be troubling the top four. Yet the race for fourth is about as composed as a drunk on stilts and in that context the bare minimum may be enough. It is not a great Arsenal side \u2013 name another Wenger XI they would beat \u2013 but they have a great striker. To push on from here, he cannot be allowed to leave. JS If you're looking for entertainment, go to Fulham The Makelele role was invented just down the road from Craven Cottage, yet Fulham's idea of a holding midfielder is not someone who can win the ball and then pass it five yards to a more creative player. It's Danny Murphy, a player whose first thought in possession is always about how he can hurt the opposition. Martin Jol's front six against Wolves was remarkably attacking; the only defensive players were, funnily enough, in defence and it is surely no coincidence that only Chelsea, Tottenham and the Manchester clubs have scored more goals at home than Fulham, who took a dismal Wolves apart with their take on tiki-taka by the Thames. Jol's predecessor, Mark Hughes, bought Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to play up front. Jol has reinvented the Belgian as a central midfielder and he is thriving in his new role, where he was unplayable against Wolves. Bryan Ruiz has also excelled in midfield and although he was missing against Terry Connor's side, the Costa Rican linked up beautifully with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 against QPR last week. There is a theory that such inventive players need added protection from their team-mates, but Jol is set on disproving that, favouring a conventional 4-4-2. Add the goal threat of Clint Dempsey into the mix and Fulham have one of the best midfields in the division. Fulham's main problem under Hughes and Roy Hodgson was a lack of punch in attack, but the signing of Pavel Pogrebnyak from Stuttgart appears to have solved that. Perhaps now it is not so difficult to work out why Jol was not so keen on Bobby Zamora, whose replacement has helped himself to five goals in his first three games. The Russian was a key part of the excellent Zenit St Petersburg side that won the Uefa Cup in 2008 and although he has lost his way since then, his perfect hat-trick against Wolves demonstrated his talent. Fulham have potentially not had a striker as good as him since Louis Saha. Or, indeed, a team as exciting as this in their history. JS Don't rule out Hodgson Roy Hodgson was never the man for Liverpool and he deserved to be sacked, probably long before he was. Yet failing in one job does not necessarily make him a bad manager, and nor does it emphatically mean he could not manage England; after all, he has a history of succeeding with smaller sides, which is precisely what England are. Harry Redknapp is, of course, still the overwhelming favourite, but with reports emerging last week that he might not be so desperate to take over as many assumed, the FA needs a contingency plan, which partly ought to involve striking a line through Stuart Pearce's name. However, working on the basis that no country should ever be allowed to pay \u00a36m a year to hire a foreign manager, or else international football is just a slightly altered version of club football, England must appoint an Englishman and Hodgson has quietly rebuilt his reputation after his harrowing experience at Anfield. Regardless of what his critics say, he did well at Fulham and his improving West Bromwich side are now in the top half of the table after three successive victories, the latest coming at home to Chelsea. It is highly unlikely the FA can choose Hodgson ahead of Redknapp, but if Daniel Levy plays hardball or Redknapp decides to stay at Spurs, then Hodgson may be the best alternative. JS Sigurdsson will have plenty of suitors this summer Gylfi Sigurdsson came on at half-time in Swansea's win over Arsenal during January. It was his Premier League debut. Twenty-five minutes later, he produced a wonderful curved pass to set up the winner for Danny Graham and make Brendan Rodgers feel very smug indeed. Sigurdsson has not been out of the side since then and his growing influence was underlined by two excellent goals, the first a glorious long-range curler into the top corner, in Swansea's 2-0 win at Wigan Athletic on Saturday. Unfortunately for Swansea, the Icelandic midfielder is only on loan from Hoffenheim, who signed him for \u00a36m from Reading in 2010, until the end of the season and if he continues in this vein, he will not be short of admirers in the summer. There are not many sides Sigurdsson wouldn't improve. JS De Gea is in credit Sir Alex Ferguson may be the greatest manager of all time but he has never been shy when it comes to proclaiming the importance of luck. Napoleon would certainly have approved of Ferguson's generalship. The catalytic signing of Eric Cantona came about because Howard Wilkinson made an inquiry about Denis Irwin. Ferguson would have lost Roy Keane had anybody in the Blackburn office stayed late at work on a Friday evening. And the Treble-winning partnership of Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke came about by chance. Ferguson got lucky again at the start of February. David de Gea had played in only two of the previous nine games, making costly mistakes against both Blackburn and Liverpool. Then Anders Lindegaard was injured. It meant that Ferguson, who surprisingly appeared to be losing faith in De Gea, had no option but to play him. De Gea responded with the save of the season, from Juan Mata, and has been in outstanding form ever since. He earned United at least two points, maybe all three, at Norwich last weekend, and made a deceptively brilliant save from Jake Livermore's deflected shot on Sunday when the score was 1-0. There is a perception that De Gea has cost United a lot of points this season. It doesn't really stack up. While he was culpable in their departure from the Champions League and FA Cup, he has only really cost them a single league point with that mistake against Blackburn. He is certainly in credit, having made a series of exceptional saves in matches at Stoke, Liverpool, Chelsea, Norwich and now Spurs. He has also shown admirable dignity and resilience, the sort most of us can only dream of, in the face of media bullying. De Gea still struggles with crosses and set-pieces and certainly does not radiate security. Nor should he: he is a 21-year-old playing in an intimidatingly alien environment and in a position where maturity usually isn't reached until the thirties. At the age of 21, Peter Schmeichel was playing for Hvidovre and Edwin van der Sar was sitting on the Ajax bench. The surprise is not that De Gea has made mistakes; it's that he has not made more. He has given plenty of demonstrations of his raw, rare talent. No Premier League goalkeeper will have a better portfolio of saves in 2011-12. When it comes to shot-stopping, DDG is dead, dead good. It's probable that he will be guilty of another cock-up or two before the end of the season; it's certain that he will earn United more points with saves that take the breath away. Ferguson knew this when he identified De Gea as Van der Sar's replacement. In that sense, he's not lucky at all. RS",

      "body": "<h2>Arsenal must not sell Van Persie</h2> <p>Missed chances, a wasted penalty, great saves and a last-minute winner: it certainly sounds like an Arsenal game, only this time it was Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side carrying out the mugging for once. After becoming the first side to win at Liverpool in any competition this season, in rather fortunate circumstances, Wenger was perfectly happy to admit how lucky Arsenal were.</p> <p>\"We could have been two or three goals down at half-time,\" he said. They stayed in the game though, and if Arsenal can stay in a game, Robin van Persie can win them the game. Where Arsenal would be without the Dutchman hardly bears thinking about; as it is, despite the problems they have encountered all season, they now find themselves in the unlikely position of being the favourites to finish fourth \u2013 or even third \u2013 and qualify for the Champions League, Saturday's victory moving them 10 points clear of Liverpool. Given the various crises they have faced throughout the season, it would arguably rank as one of Wenger's finest achievements.</p> <p>He would not be able to carry it off without Van Persie, whose two goals at Anfield took his tally in the league to 25, which equates to 45.5 percent of Arsenal's goals. Liverpool have scored 30, Luis Su\u00e1rez only contributing six and Andy Carroll three. Between them, Fernando Torres, Daniel Sturridge and Didier Drogba have managed 13 for Chelsea. Only Newcastle have a striker who can rival Van Persie, and while they still harbour hopes of finishing fourth, they will be grateful if Demba Ba's 17 goals are enough to earn them Europa League football next season. What Arsenal's rivals would give to have Van Persie leading their attack.</p> <p>We may find out the answer to that this summer. Barely a day goes by without Van Persie being linked to Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid, which is understandable given the sales of Cesc F\u00e1bregas and Samir Nasri last summer. Their resolve will surely be tested again, but this time they must not break; instead, in the way that Tottenham resisted Chelsea's interest in Luka Modric, they have to convince Van Persie to extend his contract, which expires next summer.</p> <p>Always a classy player, Van Persie has become the complete striker, his first goal at Liverpool a fine header, his second a beautifully controlled volley in stoppage time. As Alex Song's chipped pass dropped towards Van Persie, there was no debate about it: you knew he was going to score.</p> <p>In a sense, considering Chelsea's implosion and the money wasted by Liverpool, Arsenal have got away with last summer's inertia. In another year, they would not be troubling the top four. Yet the race for fourth is about as composed as a drunk on stilts and in that context the bare minimum may be enough.

      "bodyText": "You don't much hear the phrase \"wicked issue\" these days, but the problems in government and policy it refers to are as knotty as ever. Current examples include child support \u2013 the National Audit Office has just produced a gloomy report on its permanent IT difficulties \u2013 and vocational skills training, where quangos are created and abolished at dizzying speed. Wicked issues \u2013 intractable problems that governments can't ignore, regardless of their ideological stance \u2013 aren't confined to the UK borders either. Today's wicked issues surely include migration, the battle between human rights and security and what to do with the residues of empire in Gibraltar and the Falklands. Often, the response to such issues is tinkering with the institutional structure. Ministers and civil servants find it easier to swap name badges and stationery and, the clich\u00e9 springs readily to mind, rearrange the deckchairs. The Smith Institute has just highlighted a classic example of policy making by rearranging the office furniture, and then getting its authors to recommend yet further institutional shake-up. The terrain this time is regional policy, which embraces local government, the English question, the gaping asymmetry between London and the south-east and the rest of the country in terms of productivity and growth \u2013 and, of course, the political fact Labour draws its strength more from north than south, the Tories and vice versa. At the launch of the Smith report, Changing Gear, someone labelled English regional policy as Maoist \u2013 and it has been in a state of permanent revolution ever since it was invented in the 1930s. Just after the 2010 election, the Cameron government smashed the regional development agencies (RDAs) created under Labour and replaced them with local enterprise partnerships, a variant on something tried under the Thatcher and Major governments \u2013 non-statutory groupings of councillors, businesses and others, with very little money to spend and, on the evidence of the past 18 months, destined for oblivion. But the nature of wicked issues is that it's easier to identify failings than find a way forward. Michael Ward, the ex-Greater London councillor and economic development specialist who edited the Smith report, points out anomalies. \"Bizarrely,\" he says, \"it's only in London, the most prosperous of the old nine standard regions, that a strategic planning framework survives. Yet from the abolition of the GLC in 1986 to 2000, London had been the only English region without a strategic plan.\" The Blair and Brown governments were hyperactive on the regional front, but arguably overreached in holding a referendum on a regional assembly for the northeast, which the public rejected. The RDAs never won popular support, partly because local government attacked their legitimacy. Planning is now an administrative and political mess, as the government's attempt to push through the high-speed railway to Birmingham is demonstrating. Advocates of re-weighting the UK government and creating some political entity called England often wish away the differences in prosperity and prospects between the south-east and eastern regions and the West Midlands, the north-west and north with Yorkshire, the south-west and the East Midlands in between. Just because Kent and Durham are in England offers no guarantee that Tory voters in the former will approve transfer of funds or powers to Labour voters in the latter. Yet the Smith authors passionately argue the case for trying to rebalance the economy of England, from which everyone would benefit. But regional policy is a wicked issue precisely because securing agreement is so difficult. Ward calls for a re-run of the Redcliffe Maud review \u2013 the massive study of local government functions and boundaries set in train by the Wilson government. But isn't local government reorganisation another wicked issue. Everyone can agree boundaries are anachronistic, district councils dysfunctional and incapable, and the financial base of local government inadequate; there's not even the glimmering of consensus on what to do. Royal commissions were once a medium for mobilising consensus but that model no longer works, because it rests on deference and obeisance to expert authority. In the real world, the economy of England's conurbations and the employment base of the north and west of England have been reshaped and left to rot. In the world of policy and politics, we're fated to go through yet another cycle of institutional destruction and creation. This article is published by Guardian Professional.

      "body": "<p>You don't much hear the phrase \"wicked issue\" these days, but the problems in government and policy it refers to are as knotty as ever.</p> <p>Current examples include child support \u2013 the National Audit Office has just produced a gloomy report on its permanent IT difficulties \u2013 and vocational skills training, where quangos are created and abolished at dizzying speed.</p> <p>Wicked issues \u2013 intractable problems that governments can't ignore, regardless of their ideological stance \u2013 aren't confined to the UK borders either. Today's wicked issues surely include migration, the battle between human rights and security and what to do with the residues of empire in Gibraltar and the Falklands.</p> <p>Often, the response to such issues is tinkering with the institutional structure. Ministers and civil servants find it easier to swap name badges and stationery and, the clich\u00e9 springs readily to mind, rearrange the deckchairs.</p> <p>The Smith Institute has just highlighted a classic example of policy making by rearranging the office furniture, and then getting its authors to recommend yet further institutional shake-up. The terrain this time is regional policy, which embraces local government, the English question, the gaping asymmetry between London and the south-east and the rest of the country in terms of productivity and growth \u2013 and, of course, the political fact Labour draws its strength more from north than south, the Tories and vice versa.</p> <p>At the launch of the Smith report, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=changing%20gear%20smith%20institute&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smith-institute.org.uk%2Ffile%2FChanging%2520Gear.pdf&amp;ei=qoZPT4fdGsal8gOjqunwBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE94U3mBnJsZjZwdkF4dM5hgJgBxA&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Changing Gear</a>, someone labelled English regional policy as Maoist \u2013 and it has been in a state of permanent revolution ever since it was invented in the 1930s. Just after the 2010 election, the Cameron government smashed the regional development agencies (RDAs) created under Labour and replaced them with local enterprise partnerships, a variant on something tried under the Thatcher and Major governments \u2013 non-statutory groupings of councillors, businesses and others, with very little money to spend and, on the evidence of the past 18 months, destined for oblivion.</p> <p>But the nature of wicked issues is that it's easier to identify failings than find a way forward. Michael Ward, the ex-Greater London councillor and economic development specialist who edited the Smith report, points out anomalies. \"Bizarrely,\" he says, \"it's only in London, the most prosperous of the old nine standard regions, that a strategic planning framework survives. Yet from the abolition of the GLC in 1986 to 2000, London had been the only English region without a strategic plan.\"</p> <p>The Blair and Brown governments were hyperactive on the regional front, but arguably overreached in holding a referendum on a regional assembly for the northeast, which the public rejected. The RDAs never won popular support, partly because local government attacked their legitimacy. Planning is now an administrative and political mess, as the government's attempt to push through the high-speed railway to Birmingham is demonstrating.</p> <p>Advocates of re-weighting the UK government and creating some political entity called England often wish away the differences in prosperity and prospects between the south-east and eastern regions and the West Midlands, the north-west and north with Yorkshire, the south-west and the East Midlands in between. Just because Kent and Durham are in England offers no guarantee that Tory voters in the former will approve transfer of funds or powers to Labour voters in the latter.</p> <p>Yet the Smith authors passionately argue the case for trying to rebalance the economy of England, from which everyone would benefit. But regional policy is a wicked issue precisely because securing agreement is so difficult.</p> <p>Ward calls for a re-run of the Redcliffe Maud review \u2013 the massive study of local government functions and boundaries set in train by the Wilson government. But isn't local government reorganisation another wicked issue. Everyone can agree boundaries are anachronistic, district councils dysfunctional and incapable, and the financial base of local government inadequate; there's not even the glimmering of consensus on what to do.</p> <p>Royal commissions were once a medium for mobilising consensus but that model no longer works, because it rests on deference and obeisance to expert authority. In the real world, the economy of England's conurbations and the employment base of the north and west of England have been reshaped and left to rot.</p> <p>In the world of policy and politics, we're fated to go through yet another cycle of institutional destruction and creation.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

I'm particularly looking forward to two currently being written by Nick Davies and Tom Watson MP. But I want to extol the virtues of a book that's already been published, The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial* Edited by Richard Keeble of Lincoln University and John Mair of Coventry University, it has contributions from more than 30 journalists and academics. The tone is set in a preface by John Lloyd of the Financial Times, who is director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, and also in an opening statement by Keeble. Lloyd writes: \"Modern newspapers are an expression \u2013 a high expression \u2013 of an enlightenment philosophy, based on the belief that the truth is available to be discovered, that public business and public figures should be accountable to the rest of society and their actions made as transparent as possible and that debate is necessary for a democratic and civil society. That is not because, as both John Milton and John Stuart Mill believed, that truth will always win out: it often won't. Rather it is because if such debate is suppressed, so freedom will also be curtailed. What we have learned about phone hacking at the News of the World, and about the general behaviour of the tabloid press which is being illuminated, bit by bit, by the Leveson inquiry, is destructive of these principles which newspapers, and their owners, insist they live by.\" Keeble argues that the daily revelations are \"highlighting the corruption, illegality and distorted news values at the heart of British mainstream journalism in an unprecedented way. \"How can press standards be improved? What kind of regulation, if any, is required? These are just two of the many questions now being asked with a new sense of urgency.\" Trying to answer such questions, and posing more of their own, are a range of contributors that includes professors Brian Cathcart, Tim Luckhurst, Steven Barnett, Ivor Gaber and Chris Frost plus Kevin Marsh, former head of the BBC college of journalism, Nicholas Jones, the former BBC industrial correspondent and Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger. There is so much to recommend that I intend to run short extracts over the coming month, beginning tomorrow with a chapter written by a student journalist entitled \"Hacking our future: what are trainee journalists to learn from the hackgate saga?\" *The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial is published by Abramis, and is available here on Amazon",

In the same way that any builder worth their wages would first ensure the foundations are solid before building the grand design above ground (which will be ineffective if not underpinned properly). I humbly offer the following five suggestions about what will contribute to effective learning. If you don't have some or indeed all of these, there is likely to be medium and long-term ineffectiveness to your teaching and pupil learning. Firstly, how much sleep are your pupils and indeed you as a teacher getting? Sleep research by David Dinges at the University of Pennsylvania has found that adults need eight hours of sleep a night: only 5% of people adapt to sleeping less than eight hours. The rest of us just perform at a far lower level than if fully rested. At an extreme, if you only have six hours of sleep a night for two weeks, you become the equivalent of being cognitively drunk. Shockingly, I know of a school that surveyed its pupils and found that 55% of pupils did not get eight hours of sleep a night. A recent survey by the National Sleep council (March is national Bed Month, apparently) reports 92% of teachers complaining that pupils are so tired they are unable to pay attention in class. More than a third (38%) said lack of sleep among youngsters is a daily problem for them. The importance of being rested, for all involved, might seem obvious, but it's still important and is usually overlooked by schools in encouraging proper sleep patterns. Secondly, are pupils having breakfast? Research from Harvard Medical School has highlighted the cognitive, social and emotional problems that pupils suffer if they do not eat breakfast. There is a very interesting campaign in Canada called Breakfast for Learning which might be of interest to colleagues. Of course, there are significant social implications and ramifications, as many pupils unfortunately do not skip breakfast out of choice but out of their own personal family circumstances. It is such sad stories that impress the necessity of the EMA which has been hacked away at in recent years. Aside from pupils who skip breakfast not out of choice but rather necessity, there are pupils who skip breakfast for other reasons, including their own body image desires or indeed just to get a few extra minutes in bed each morning. But having breakfast is clearly important. It's hard to learn if irritable, distracted or even weak, and a sensitive encouragement to take breakfast in the morning is important for learning. Thirdly, how much water are pupils drinking in an average day? Two litres of water should be consumed as a minimum, and for teenage boys this should be two and a half litres. A mental decrease in concentration, memory and attention of up to 10% of cognitive ability is felt once thirst is experienced. Thirst is the sign that your body has lost between 0.8-2% of your body weight in water, and seeing that the brain consists of 80% water, the centrality of water cannot be understated. There is a national campaign within Britain to highlight this hugely important area: water is cool in school might be of interest. Fourthly, what are you hoping for pupils to learn in class? John Hattie's meta-analyses of over 800 learning research projects concluded that successful learning is very clearly and explicitly linked with four main things, one of which is the setting of learning intentions. \"He concluded that successful learning is dependent on clear learning intentions that describe the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values that the student needs to learn,\" a GTC summary concluded. Giving pupils clear success criteria to achieve in a lesson also visibly boosted learning (eg you will by the end of this lesson know ten words associated with ancient Rome). So how \"visible\" is the learning you want pupils to achieve in a lesson? Do you share learning objectives and test these at the end of a lesson to see if you/your pupils have succeeded in the lesson? New Ofsted guidelines now stipulate that future lessons cannot be graded outstanding unless they have learning objectives shared with the class. Finally, are you looking after yourself? If you're so knackered you can't effectively and consistently intervene to promote learning, or are fed up and losing your zest for the classroom due to overwork or stress (whether caused internally or externally), you yourself won't be as effective at the front of and moving around the classroom. I won't labour this point anymore as I've already written a whole article on this subject of teachers taking care of themselves, but it does matter. It's no good having the fireworks lesson all ready to go if you're then devoid of passion, energy and enthusiasm to deliver to and control your audience. I know it's easy to say, and all sorts of things, professional and personal, crop up. But try as best you can to maintain a balance so that when you do enter the classroom sparks fly. So, try to encourage all in the classroom to get to bed relatively early, eat in the morning and drink plenty of water each day. In addition you might think about what you exactly want your pupils to achieve in any given lesson and ensure they know what's expected of them in any given session. Make sure they are learning, not just doing. And remember to look after your own personal happiness in addition to that of your pupils. I wouldn't say that all that subsequently flows from these conditions in terms of lesson content will then be plain sailing or some type of educational supernova, but at least whatever you do then in lessons will hopefully have the solid foundations necessary for subsequent learning. \u2022 Sean Reid is a PGCE tutor for the University of Buckingham.

I want to be the driving force that makes Liverpool, once again, the international powerhouse it once was and still deserves to be. We are a city which faces massive challenges. But at the same time, we are also a city with massive opportunities. I firmly believe Liverpool is the most innovative, most enterprising, most ambitious city you could possibly imagine. And during the eight weeks of campaigning to come, I will highlight the very best Liverpool has to offer. During my campaign, Liverpool will host the Global Entrepreneurship Congress. This is a massive coup for us, and will bring 5,000 of the world's leading entrepreneurs to Liverpool. The GEC was in Shanghai last year, and Dubai the year before. That the Kauffman Foundation has chosen Liverpool to continue this legacy shows just how seriously the world takes our city. Liverpool will be put under the spotlight, and this is just one example of how far our city has come. Its time to think again about Liverpool. We're not a city down and out, depressed and demoralised. We are a city which is ambitious and confident. We are a city full of imagination, creativity, and talent. My promise, as Mayor of Liverpool, will be to help that talent flourish wherever it is found. My vision for Liverpool is one where all of our residents have a decent home and all our children have an excellent education. One where every family is able to work and earn a living, one where our city is growing and thriving and where we all can share in a bright future. Ultimately, my vision of Liverpool is one where my values of fairness, equality and freedom are the underpinning principles that govern the daily lives of all of our residents. Our city faces great challenges. We are still the most deprived city in the country. We still face massive Government cuts. More people are being left unemployed, more families are losing their homes, and our schools still desperately need investment. Meeting those challenges will require one thing above anything else: leadership. And showing strong and effective leadership is what I do best. As the Mayor of Liverpool, I will spend every waking hour striving for a better, brighter future.

Anyway, there is no agreement that Neil Kinnock lost the election that to John Major entirely due to The Sun's admittedly unfair and prolonged campaign against Kinnock. Since the hacking scandal broke, there is no question that Murdoch has entirely lost his political clout. So it is odd that Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, who generally regarded as the canniest of current political operators, should choose to cosy up to Murdoch at this moment. MacWhirter agrees, arguing that \"Murdoch is the most toxic brand in British public life, his crude right-wing publications a byword for bent news and illegal practices such as phone hacking.\" Salmond can brush off criticism from both Labour and Tories because of their own courting of Murdoch, through Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and now David Cameron. \"An entire generation of politicians has been corrupted... by association with this sinister oligarch,\" wrote MacWhirter in his Sunday Herald column yesterday. He concluded: \"Now we even have our own Scottish first minister worming his way into Rupert Murdoch's unsavoury inner circle, sending him cosy notes and free tickets, meeting his agents 26 times since 2007, trying to win favours from Murdoch's disreputable rags. Politicians always excuse this kind of ingratiating behaviour on the grounds that they have to keep the press on side; it's just how things are.

Last week, I showed you a short video that discusses happy numbers, a concept that ties in with an earlier video I shared about narcissistic numbers. But what do these concepts have to do with what mathematicians do when they visit the pub? In this video, we continue the discussion about happy numbers when we go on a mathematical tour through a \"happification tree\", meeting a few narcissistic numbers along the way, and discover another mathematically-derived structure, dubbed the \"melancoil\" by today's presenter, Matt; Visit numberphile's YouTube channel [video link]. So what is the answer to the question I originally posed? What do narcissistic numbers and happy numbers share with the wild events that transpire when mathematicians visit the pub? Fruitless loops! .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. Numberphile is another of many video projects by video journalist Brady Haran.

      "bodyText": "The mistakes of the past have resulted in the dire situation that all Greeks now face. Yet the crisis in Greece is not a financial one but rather a political one and the long-term solution will never be found in ministerial speeches or government buildings. It will be found where the power now truly lies, with the young unemployed throughout Greece, with any person with an idea, even with the protestors themselves. Last month, I was lucky enough to lead a fantastic group of social entrepreneurs and young business people from across the UK to take part in Entrepreneur Week in Greece, run with the Hellenic Start up Association, founded by Dimitris Tsigoswww.hellenicstartups.gr. Greece faces huge problems: an unemployment rate of almost 50% amongst young people and national debt running at over 160% of GDP. But it also lacks real support or networks for business - the current system seems to inhibit business start-ups and therefore job and wealth creation. One example of this anti-business culture is the obligatory payment of around \u20ac200 per month that has to be paid to the government, by anyone starting a business regardless of its profitability. As one of my colleagues on the UK delegation, Joanna Montgomery, Founder of Little Riot said: \"There is absolutely no way I would still have my company had I been subject to a similar system.\" But not all is doom and gloom, there are rays of light over Athens, one excellent example being that of Co-Lab, a social enterprise that has been founded by Stavros Messinis. It is based in Central Athens and is a start-up hub to encourage and facilitate collaborative working as well as running regular start up weekend events. This is what Greece needs. It has the people (the second highest level of university education percentage wise of population), it has the aspiration, judging by the number of people I met who want to run their own businesses and with the current economic turmoil, it now has the reason. Every new business that sets up in Greece could have a social impact as well as a financial one and every person, young or old, who is setting up a business can be socially entrepreneurial and in turn benefit many others. Young Greeks in particular have the chance to create a better society for themselves and generations in the future. As such they need to realise the potential they now possess and face up to the responsibility that has been thrust upon them. The Greek government is not the change maker; the real drivers of this desperately needed shift, are the citizens of Greece. They need to create the business, economic and social solutions to the problems that Greece does and will continue to face. They need to embed a culture of responsible capitalism within business at all levels from start-up through to the established corporates. The need to create an entrepreneurial and business environment where start-ups and companies are not just job and wealth creators, but have positive impact and active engagement that creates long term social solutions within the communities in which they operate will be critical. What Greek politicians can do is encouraging people like Dimitris and Stavros. These individuals are social entrepreneurs, creating initiatives and enterprises, which focus on a profit with wider social purpose. They highlight the power individuals can have within their local sector and the wider society. If Greece can nurture a culture and ecosystem that encourages enterprise growth alongside positive social impact, then maybe the Greek economy can be the fist one to aim for a truly national form of responsible capitalism, with individuals signing up to a wider social contract. In the UK and across Europe, we need to ensure that the individuals within Greece who are trying to create positive change for themselves and their nation don't stand alone. We need to help them develop the skills sets needed to create sustainable and profitable social enterprises. The power is shifting, the Greek population now have the responsibility to provide positive change for their country and we have a responsibility to help them do exactly that. Comments from the UK delegation to Entrepreneur Week Greece: Glynn Pegler, founder of youth media organisation Culture Group:\"It was painfully obvious that no system of support for entrepreneurs in Greece exists. The private and public sectors are completely blurred. The mindset is some 10 years behind countries like the UK. Greece needs changes in infrastructure, changes in the mentalities of the facilitators and the standards that they expect. There is a need for people who can turn knowledge into change. I am pleased to support Young Brits in calling for a new fiscal framework for Greece; faster procedures for the creation of businesses there and the re-organisation of the public sector to facilitate the building of networks and peer support.\" Nathaniel Peat, Founder of The Safety Box: \"Greece needs to change the whole legislation to allow young people to start business, the education system needs to be redesigned and entrepreneurship and enterprise needs to be taught on all levels both primary, secondary and post secondary education\". Joanna Montgomery, Founder of Little Riot and Shell LiveWire Award Winner: \"I feel incredibly lucky for everything the UK affords me. I have been supported and encouraged on so many levels since I started out, and organisations such as Shell LiveWIRE and others add an extra framework around young entrepreneurs like myself. I believe Greece could really flourish if similar support was made available to young entrepreneurs.\" Nathan Dicks, Founder of Rewise Learning and UnLtd Award Winner: \"The key in Greece is a more equal society and a morally justified form of capitalism where everyone can benefit from growth\" Marty Bell, Founder of We Own and Virgin Media Pioneer: \"Although the country is in a dark place, there was a huge amount of positivity over there. They understand that there must be a new mentality towards entrepreneurship, a mentality that fosters creativity &amp; pushes ambitions, that won't be linked with safety - but with innovation and creativity.\" Alex Mitchell is the Co-Founder and Chairman of Young Brits, as well as being the UK President of the G20 Young Entrepreneurs Alliance and Vice President of the European Confederation of Young Entrepreneurs.

      "bodyText": "John Ware and Vivian White, two of the BBC's longest serving and most respected current affairs journalists, are leaving the corporation, with the latter bowing out with Panorama documentary Murdoch's Satellite TV Pirates later this month. White's last Panorama as a BBC employee, a report to be broadcast on Monday 12 March, is, according to the corporation, \"an investigation into fresh hacking allegations but at the heart of [Rupert Murdoch's] pay TV empire ... exposing how former police detectives were used to recruit people to break the law in order to bring down Murdoch's commercial rival\". The 65-year-old has covered a diverse range of subjects for the BBC, from the scandal of the elderly forced to sell their homes to pay for care, to presenting from the party political conferences. In January, he made a popular Panorama programme about rising train fares. But since 2001 and 9/11 he has also reported extensively on British Muslims, including from Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. White, who has worked for Panorama for about 20 years, said: \"For a reporter, it's an absolutely fantastic privilege to work there.\" Ware, 64, who since 2007 has worked more broadly across BBC current affairs as well as for Panorma, is taking voluntary redundancy. He said that although he had been critical about aspects of the BBC, including the power over current affair programmes exercised by channel controllers, he wasn't pushed: \"I wanted to go.\" In a leaked email, Ware described the former BBC1 controller, Jay Hunt, as shallow as a paddling pool. Ware has worked for the BBC for 26 years, and has a deep knowledge and understanding of Northern Ireland's troubled past. He won TV journalist of the year from the Royal Television Society in 2001 for his programme titled Who Bombed Omagh? \"I have other things to do, probably a BBC2 programme, a book I want to write about the policing inquiry into the Omagh bombings. Panorama has got a tremendous momentum currently. It's on song.\" His most recent Panorama, which screened in December, was about public finance initiatives, titled Who's Getting Rich on Your Money? Panorama editor Tom Giles said: \"I have known them both for ages and admire their work. I certainly envisage them doing more for me in future as freelancers.\" The BBC's current affairs department is facing a restructure, which includes cutting posts, predating the current Delivering Quality First cuts. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "The empowerment of women and girls has risen up the development agenda in recent years, championed by powerful financial institutions, the philanthropic wings of major transnational corporations and influential development donors as a sought-after panacea. There's an appealing simplicity to the argument for investing in women and girls. Women and girls have been overlooked. They have so much potential. Get them into work, and poverty will disappear. Get them into school, and high birthrates will decrease. Get them into politics, and peace will reign. Invest in their potential and in their families, and communities and nations will yield the benefits. It's a formula that harnesses persuasive gender myths with an action agenda blind to many of the principal underlying causes of women's disempowerment. These myths \u2013 that women are more industrious and responsible than men, that women politicians can't be corrupt and always represent women's interests, that women care more for their children and the environment and that they are closer to the earth \u2013 may be based on some truths. But their power is based less on reality than on what they offer those who tell and listen to them. All this makes for a promise to investors of a safe bet, and a guaranteed return. But a disquieting truth is staring us in the face. All around the world changes are happening in women's lives \u2013 in many countries, women are discovering new freedoms, exploring new horizons and breaking away from old patterns, constraints and certainties. In the process, they are facing opposition and exploitation, and encountering new forms of oppression. Change is happening, but women's journeys of empowerment rarely follow the simple linear formula that development agencies and their corporate sponsors would have us believe. The findings of Pathways of Women's Empowerment, a five-year multi-country collaborative research and communications initiative, suggest that women seize opportunities for empowerment wherever they find them. Sometimes, they find these opportunities in interventions targeting women \u2013 like the micro-enterprise programme that offered one Afghan woman the chance to set up a hairdressing business: a space that allowed her to make money, but perhaps more importantly, to socialise with other women (pdf). Sometimes, these opportunities come from women's own collective action \u2013 like the Indian sex worker collective that routed out under-age sex work in their community, and challenged the abusive treatment of sex workers at the hands of police and society. Where projects, programmes and policies have made a difference, they have done so because they recognised the power of relationships, the significance of recognition and the importance of confronting limiting stereotypes and institutionalising new norms. At the heart of these changes have been women's organisations and movements, visionary and committed feminist bureaucrats and collective action by women themselves. Research by Pathways suggests that powerful sources of empowerment may lie in places overlooked by development. Research on women's sexuality highlights the empowering dimensions of pleasure, and the transformative possibilities of approaches that recognise this power. Other pleasures emerge from surveys of women in Bangladesh and Afghanistan that came up with the unexpected finding that women's access to television was the most powerful indicator of empowerment. Television brought these women in contact with worlds, ideas and possibilities that they might otherwise never have experienced, and it exposed them to new tactics for navigating tricky relationships with their husbands and in-laws. It also gave them an opportunity for leisure, something so vital to women's and girls' empowerment and so absent from development narratives. The research suggests that piecemeal economic and political empowerment programmes might give individual women opportunities to improve their lives through loans or training, but they fall short of achieving real and sustained change. \"Empowerment lite\" might deliver the kind of results development agencies have been reduced to measuring \u2013 numbers of women on courses, numbers of girls at school, numbers of women on councils. But this rarely translates into the kinds of transformations that lie beyond such limiting measures, such as changes in women's sense of their own possibilities and horizons, and shifts of power that are the precondition for creating a more just and equal world. For all the warm and fuzzy images of smiling women and laughing girls that appear in marketing materials, the vision of change purveyed by \"empowerment lite\" is frighteningly stark: one in which women and girls are recruited for their industriousness, and put to work to maintain a status quo that is deeply unjust. Men appear as shadowy figures, menacing or useless, never as allies or agents of positive change \u2013 women and girls are left to bear the responsibility of improving everyone's lives. Empowerment lite offers women entry into labour markets that continue to devalue their labour and does nothing to support them to organise to claim their rights. It fails to address the sexism they face in the labour market and political institutions, or the violence that blights so many women's lives, or to support their efforts to challenge the structural inequities that produce and sustain their disempowerment. And rosy as it is, there is nothing in this vision about enabling women and girls to enjoy life's pleasures and realise their own hopes and dreams. If women and girls are really to be put at the heart of development efforts, a good place to begin is to ask not what women and girls can do for development, but what development might do for them. It's almost 20 years since the fourth world women's conference in Beijing set out a Platform for Action. It's time to revisit and revitalise those commitments.",

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday 29 February, Microsoft released the consumer preview edition of Windows 8. Duly I downloaded it and set it up as my main development machine. You want to know about the first day? Running Windows 8 Screenshot by Matthew Baxter-Reynolds. Click for larger version on Flickr. Some rights reserved This is what the Start screen really looks like \u2013 a big mess of grey-ish tiles, not the wonderful active ones you see in the adverts (and the picture at the top). I've been lucky in the timing of this release in that all of the projects I'm working on for customers are devoid of any weird stuff, and I've been able to get everything up and running on Windows 8 without any bother at all. Visual Studio 2008 and 2012, SQL Server 2008 R2, various components and bits and pieces need to support my apps. All installed, all building and running with no drama at all. It's almost been too easy. Since installing, I've learnt to regard Windows 8 as being two operating systems. One part I've been thinking of as Windows 7.1. The \"classic desktop\" bits of Windows 8 is just Windows 7, minus the Start orb, with a new theme to replace Aero. This part is frankly superb. I can't remember the last time I used a beta version of a Microsoft OS and had it work this well six or seven months ahead of RTM [release to manufacture, when the code is final]. Hence I'm thinking of this as Windows 7.1 \u2013 it's really just a service pack. You could actually roll this part out and use it quite happily. But what about that flashy Start screen? That works really nicely as well, and it should do because although that looks like it's part of the new Metro-style gubbins, it's not. What's happened there is that the Windows team has made the regular Start menu a full screen affair so although it looks like a Metro app, it's not. You can see this for yourself \u2013 open Task Manager, look in the \"App history\" tab and you won't find an app that maps to the Start screen. Also, if you kill off the Explorer.exe process, you'll lose the Start screen. Restart Explorer.exe and you'll see the Start screen reloading. Screenshot by Matthew Baxter-Reynolds. Click for larger version on Flickr. Some rights reserved The Windows 8 Task Manager showing running Metro-style apps, of which a Start menu one is not there, because that's not a Metro-style app. It just looks a lot like one. There's precedent for this \u2013 Microsoft has been changing and enhancing the behaviour of the Start menu for years. All they've done on Windows 8 is Metro-ified it. The \"hot corners\" of the OS work really well as well, but again these are implemented by extensions to Explorer and the windowing subsystem components of Windows. The Metro-style apps are, in comparison, rubbish. Built-in apps It would be unfair of me to be too harsh about the quality of the built-in apps on Windows 8; it's a beta version at least half a year away from release. As a software engineer, I can intuitively \"feel\" the quality of the built-in apps; and it's early days. The difference in quality between the Windows 7.1 bits and the Metro-style bits tells something about the engineering \u2013 namely, that Windows 7 is a very solid base that's required some relatively minor changes, and that most of the engineering effort has gone into building the infrastructure to support Metro-style apps. Day-to-day, I use a virtual machine for Windows development but use a Mac for everything else. (This is another reason why I've been able to move over to Windows 8 as a primary machine rather than having to run it on a secondary machine kicking around the office.) On the Mac I run mail, Google's Chrome browser, TweetDeck, and a few other bits and pieces. I have two monitors \u2013 and I typically run Visual Studio on the main monitor and everything else on the secondary. If I'm coding away in Visual Studio and receive an email, I'll turn my head to the second monitor, bring the mail app to the foreground and off I go. Screenshot by Mattthew Baxter-Reynolds. Click for larger version on Flickr. Some rights reserved The weather app, Metro-style. Because what could be more convenient than a handful of data points taking up the entire view on an OS that's had 20 years of practice at showing windows of information. One of the things that Apple has been been criticised about on the iPad is that you have to jump in and out of apps to do anything. There's a very thunk \u2026 thunk \u2026 thunk context switch to using an iPad. That's nothing compared to life in a world where you've got a classic desktop and Metro-style. When running Windows 8 today I've pretended I'm not using a Mac. I've run VMware Fusion in full-screen, multi-monitor mode. First thing you notice is that both monitors get a taskbar. That's really confusing. But the reason becomes clear because if you open up the Windows 8 mail app \u2013 BLAM! \u2013 the thing takes over the whole of the primary monitor, obscuring the taskbar. The classic desktop remains running on the secondary monitor, with a taskbar. Click on anything on the secondary monitor and \u2013 SHOOM! \u2013 the mail app disappears because Windows thinks you've dropped out of Metro-style. Screenshot by Matthew Baxter-Reynolds. Click for larger version on Flickr. Some rights reserved Two taskbars? Well, yes. You want information needlessly duplicated. Didn't you know that? What this does for you as you use it is a whole world of \"wait \u2026 what?!\" Trying to deal with Windows when your driving results in it flipping between classic Windows and Metro-style app is like having someone sneak up behind you and flick you on the ear when you're least expecting it. This massive context switching of \"YOU'RE IN WINDOWS WAIT NO NO YOU'RE NOT!\" creates an appalling user experience. What we've managed to get here is a very, very fast way of switching between two entirely different operating systems, in much the same way that we used to have to quit Windows to run Lotus 1-2-3. Rather than it taking enough time for us to sit at our desks and have a quick cigarette (the way I assume it was done in the 80s, although for full disclosure I wouldn't actually know), it's really fast now. Progress! What is it? I keep thinking of the episode of Red Dwarf where Kryten gets turned into a human. There's a scene where Kryten is trying to get used to the capabilities of his new body. At one point, Lister can see this isn't going to end well, turns to him and says: \"You're neither one thing or the other.\" I think the reason why this scene occurs to me is that Kryten desperately wanting to be human gives up the things that make him an android and will make the proposition fit \u2013 consquences be damned. That describes to me pretty accurately what this version of Windows is. What we have then is a line item in Microsoft's product catalogue called Windows 8 that's either a hybrid of Windows 7.1 and an as-yet-unnamed operating system, or a bastardisation of both those things. Whatever the non-Windows 7.1 bits of Windows 8 are, it's sure as hell not Windows. At present, I'm not sure which word is fair. \"Hybrid\" implies a thought-through combination of the best of features from Column A and from Column B. \"Bastardisation\" implies a slapping together of mismatched features to achieve a level of supreme clunkiness. This indeed is some of my problem with the whole arrangement. I could probably get used to the \"wait \u2026 what?\" aspects of using Windows 8; after all it's only been a day and clearly this stuff has been thought through. But if I think back over the past few months to all of the clever, clever people that I know and trust who've built careers on watching Microsoft there isn't really a sense of calm. What there is is things like Paul Thurrott tweeting that you won't be able to join a WOA tablet to a domain. For the uninitiated, \"joining a domain\" is the process that sysadmins go through to take ownership of a PC. It allows them to, among other things, apply security policies to the devices. This is one of the things that makes (or made?) BlackBerrys so popular in enterprises. The sysadmins had ultimate control over those devices, as although they might not own them in a \"nine tenths of the law\" sense, they owned them in a \"do whatever they like to them\" sense. This sort of thing gives sysadmins warm fluffy feelings and allows them to sleep peacefully at night. Lost your handset? No problem \u2013 encryption and remote-wipe is standard. Microsoft-watchers, myself included, had expected WOA tablets to have the ability to join domains, primarily so that sysadmins could have the same restful sleep advantage as they do with BlackBerry. So the announcement comes out that you can't and \u2013 well, we've seen this, it's \"wait \u2026 what?\" again. Everything I know about managing intelligent devices on a private network tells me that these things need to be joined to a domain. Thing is, we have the same thing over with Metro on the desktop. We're told it's all going to be fine and dandy but yet sit anyone with any experience down at that thing and the \"BLAM! \u2026 SWOOSH!\" aspects of running classic and Metro-style make this crazy to use on a PC. Yet we're being told to believe in Sinofsky that is all fine, and all logical (although now I think about it, we're being told that by Sinofsky), despite the fact that you can touch Metro on the desktop at it and just feel it doesn't work. It feels like it's haunted by the ghost of Microsoft Bob. Prior to running Metro on a desktop I'd rationalised away the need to join WOA tablets to a domain. \"It's fine,\" I told myself. \"These devices are more \u2013 ahem \u2013 'personal' than a PC. It's not necessary.\" Today I don't think that \u2013 I think not letting WOA tablets join a domain is a misstep What's changed? Well, now because I've seen the way Metro works on the desktop I know Microsoft is capable of making mistakes in its execution of Windows 8 as an iPad competitor. On Monday, Sinofsky's fine shoes looked sturdy. Today, I'm wondering if they're encasing feet of clay. I have a tablet over here, albeit an Intel-based rather than a nice ARM-based one, and the story is better. If you pretend it's an iPad, or even a large Windows Phone it's actually OK. It's slick enough, they keyboard is much improved, the targets are big enough to click. It's a good iPad clone. But it's rough \u2013 very rough, though not too rough for it to be given a \"beta\" label. And I suspect it'll work fine because a WOA tablet will be just one thing \u2013 it won't have this broken desktop/Metro thing going on. I'm confident WOA will turn out to be an adequate iPad-clone, providing the market stays still enough for WOA to find a way into it \u2013 but that's a story for another time. My prediction: no one will ever make sense of trying to run Metro-style and classic apps together on a PC. The PC will remain the PC and will remain the domain of the classic desktop. There's a reason we stopped dropping out of Windows to run Lotus 1-2-3. Matthew Baxter-Reynolds is the keynote speaker at the first Windows 8 Conflab being held in London on 18 April.",

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday 29 February, Microsoft released the consumer preview edition of Windows 8. Duly I downloaded it and set it up as my main development machine. You want to know about the first day?</p> <h2>Running Windows 8</h2> <p><em>Screenshot by Matthew Baxter-Reynolds. Click for larger version on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br><br><em>This is what the Start screen really looks like \u2013 a big mess of grey-ish tiles, not the wonderful active ones you see in the adverts (and the picture at the top).</em></p> <p>I've been lucky in the timing of this release in that all of the projects I'm working on for customers are devoid of any weird stuff, and I've been able to get everything up and running on Windows 8 without any bother at all. Visual Studio 2008 and 2012, SQL Server 2008 R2, various components and bits and pieces need to support my apps. All installed, all building and running with no drama at all.</p> <p>It's almost been too easy. </p> <p>Since installing, I've learnt to regard Windows 8 as being two operating systems. One part I've been thinking of as Windows 7.1. The \"classic desktop\" bits of Windows 8 is just Windows 7, minus the Start orb, with a new theme to replace Aero. This part is frankly superb. I can't remember the last time I used a beta version of a Microsoft OS and had it work this well six or seven months ahead of RTM [release to manufacture, when the code is final]. Hence I'm thinking of this as Windows 7.1 \u2013 it's really just a service pack. You could actually roll this part out and use it quite happily.</p> <p>But what about that flashy Start screen? That works really nicely as well, and it should do because although that looks like it's part of the new Metro-style gubbins, it's not. What's happened there is that the Windows team has made the regular Start menu a full screen affair so although it looks like a Metro app, it's not. You can see this for yourself \u2013 open Task Manager, look in the \"App history\" tab and you won't find an app that maps to the Start screen. Also, if you kill off the Explorer.exe process, you'll lose the Start screen. Restart Explorer.exe and you'll see the Start screen reloading.</p> <p><em>Screenshot by Matthew Baxter-Reynolds. Click for larger version on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br><br><em>The Windows 8 Task Manager showing running Metro-style apps, of which a Start menu one is not there, because that's not a Metro-style app. It just looks a lot like one.</em></p> <p>There's precedent for this \u2013 Microsoft has been changing and enhancing the behaviour of the Start menu for years. All they've done on Windows 8 is Metro-ified it.</p> <p>The \"hot corners\" of the OS work really well as well, but again these are implemented by extensions to Explorer and the windowing subsystem components of Windows.</p> <p>The Metro-style apps are, in comparison, rubbish.</p> <h2>Built-in apps</h2> <p>It would be unfair of me to be too harsh about the quality of the built-in apps on Windows 8; it's a beta version at least half a year away from release. As a software engineer, I can intuitively \"feel\" the quality of the built-in apps; and it's early days. The difference in quality between the Windows 7.1 bits and the Metro-style bits tells something about the engineering \u2013 namely, that Windows 7 is a very solid base that's required some relatively minor changes, and that most of the engineering effort has gone into building the infrastructure to support Metro-style apps.</p> <p>Day-to-day, I use a virtual machine for Windows development but use a Mac for everything else. (This is another reason why I've been able to move over to Windows 8 as a primary machine rather than having to run it on a secondary machine kicking around the office.) On the Mac I run mail, Google's Chrome browser, TweetDeck, and a few other bits and pieces. I have two monitors \u2013 and I typically run Visual Studio on the main monitor and everything else on the secondary. If I'm coding away in Visual Studio and receive an email, I'll turn my head to the second monitor, bring the mail app to the foreground and off I go.</p> <p><em>Screenshot by Mattthew Baxter-Reynolds. Click for larger version on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br><br><em>The weather app, Metro-style. Because what could be more convenient than a handful of data points taking up the entire view on an OS that's had 20 years of practice at showing windows of information.</em></p> <p>One of the things that Apple has been been criticised about on the iPad is that you have to jump in and out of apps to do anything. There's a very thunk \u2026 thunk \u2026 thunk context switch to using an iPad. That's nothing compared to life in a world where you've got a classic desktop and Metro-style.</p> <p>When running Windows 8 today I've pretended I'm not using a Mac. I've run VMware Fusion in full-screen, multi-monitor mode. First thing you notice is that both monitors get a taskbar. That's really confusing. But the reason becomes clear because if you open up the Windows 8 mail app \u2013 BLAM! \u2013 the thing takes over the whole of the primary monitor, obscuring the taskbar. The classic desktop remains running on the secondary monitor, with a taskbar. Click on anything on the secondary monitor and \u2013 SHOOM! \u2013 the mail app disappears because Windows thinks you've dropped out of Metro-style. </p> <p><em>Screenshot by Matthew Baxter-Reynolds. Click for larger version on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br><br><em>Two taskbars? Well, yes. You want information needlessly duplicated. Didn't you know that?</em></p> <p>What this does for you as you use it is a whole world of \"wait \u2026 what?!\" Trying to deal with Windows when your driving results in it flipping between classic Windows and Metro-style app is like having someone sneak up behind you and flick you on the ear when you're least expecting it. This massive context switching of \"YOU'RE IN WINDOWS WAIT NO NO YOU'RE NOT!\" creates an appalling user experience.</p> <p>What we've managed to get here is a very, very fast way of switching between two entirely different operating systems, in much the same way that we used to have to quit Windows to run Lotus 1-2-3. Rather than it taking enough time for us to sit at our desks and have a quick cigarette (the way I assume it was done in the 80s, although for full disclosure I wouldn't actually know), it's really fast now. Progress!</p> <h2>What is it?</h2> <p>I keep thinking of the episode of Red Dwarf where Kryten gets turned into a human. There's a scene where Kryten is trying to get used to the capabilities of his new body. At one point, Lister can see this isn't going to end well, turns to him and says: \"You're neither one thing or the other.\" I think the reason why this scene occurs to me is that Kryten desperately wanting to be human gives up the things that make him an android and <em>will</em> make the proposition fit \u2013 consquences be damned. That describes to me pretty accurately what this version of Windows is. </p> <p>What we have then is a line item in Microsoft's product catalogue called Windows 8 that's either a hybrid of Windows 7.1 and an as-yet-unnamed operating system, or a bastardisation of both those things. Whatever the non-Windows 7.1 bits of Windows 8 are, it's sure as hell not Windows. At present, I'm not sure which word is fair. \"Hybrid\" implies a thought-through combination of the best of features from Column A and from Column B. \"Bastardisation\" implies a slapping together of mismatched features to achieve a level of supreme clunkiness.</p> <p>This indeed is some of my problem with the whole arrangement. I could probably get used to the \"wait \u2026 what?\" aspects of using Windows 8; after all it's only been a day and clearly this stuff has been thought through. But if I think back over the past few months to all of the clever, clever people that I know and trust who've built careers on watching Microsoft there isn't really a sense of calm. What there is is things like Paul Thurrott tweeting that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/thurrott/status/174752177552756738\">you won't be able to join a WOA tablet to a domain</a>. </p> <p>For the uninitiated, \"joining a domain\" is the process that sysadmins go through to take ownership of a PC. It allows them to, among other things, apply security policies to the devices. This is one of the things that makes (or made?) BlackBerrys so popular in enterprises. The sysadmins had ultimate control over those devices, as although they might not own them in a \"nine tenths of the law\" sense, they owned them in a \"do whatever they like to them\" sense. This sort of thing gives sysadmins warm fluffy feelings and allows them to sleep peacefully at night.</p> <p>Lost your handset? No problem \u2013 encryption and remote-wipe is standard. Microsoft-watchers, myself included, had expected WOA tablets to have the ability to join domains, primarily so that sysadmins could have the same restful sleep advantage as they do with BlackBerry. So the announcement comes out that you can't and \u2013 well, we've seen this, it's \"wait \u2026 what?\" again. Everything I know about managing intelligent devices on a private network tells me that these things <em>need</em> to be joined to a domain. </p> <p>Thing is, we have the same thing over with Metro on the desktop. We're told it's all going to be fine and dandy but yet sit anyone with any experience down at that thing and the \"BLAM! \u2026 SWOOSH!\" aspects of running classic and Metro-style make this crazy to use on a PC. Yet we're being told to believe in Sinofsky that is all fine, and all logical (although now I think about it, we're being told that <em>by</em> Sinofsky), despite the fact that you can touch Metro on the desktop at it and just feel it doesn't work. It feels like it's haunted by the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1991915_1991909_1991855,00.html\">ghost of Microsoft Bob</a>. </p> <p>Prior to running Metro on a desktop I'd rationalised away the need to join WOA tablets to a domain. \"It's fine,\" I told myself. \"These devices are more \u2013 ahem \u2013 'personal' than a PC.

      "bodyText": "Save the Children recently launched its first ever multi-lingual global tweet chat, spanning 14 hours and 12 time zones, creating one conversation about the hidden crisis of child malnutrition. The tweet reach for this event topped 5 million. The event included more than 50 hosts around the world, including Bollywood stars in India, celebrity chefs in Indonesia, food bloggers in the UK, government ministers and the Asian food channel in Singapore with its 46 million viewers. We also had partner organisations involved and tweeting about the event, including the World Health Organisation and the ONE Campaign. This was an exciting new global online moment but potentially highlights something more significant in the way that international charities need to run their global communications. In the past global charities have been seen as global by default because of where they work and their coverage in traditional media. But are they truly global? The communications operations have traditionally run out of hubs like London and New York but this risks northern perspectives dominating media messaging and can blunt efforts to build global trends and awareness through social media. Often part of a development organisation's challenge is in raising awareness within developing countries. Organisations need to empower external supporters if they want to enter multiple national markets and get an issue trending globally. The global tweet chat included hosts from around the world and, as organisers, we couldn't control the message or whether other organisations might overshadow us. We had a mix of participants, including corporates, heads of state and activists with very differing approaches. Sharing hashtags that all can use (in our case #hiddencrisis), empowering social media enthusiasts and creating new innovative partnerships can create an online surge that gives exciting uplift to local events. Despite rapid improvements in usage and coverage, 70% of the world is still not online, so local events and media, especially radio, are still crucial for any global campaign that wants to have local impact and support. Events were planned locally in more than 30 countries where Save the Children supports campaigning, including India, Afghanistan, Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria and Bangladesh. But we also know that government ministers and opinion-formers are increasingly interested in Twitter around the world. The Rwandan minister of health and active tweeter @AgnesBinagwaho hosted the 0830 \u2013 0900 position in our global tweet chat, and President @jmKikwete of Tanzania tweeted his support. This was a positive public engagement by government leaders that should inspire others. Recent analysis of Africa's Twitter usage also shows 11.5m tweets were generated from the continent over three months, illustrating that the network is fast becoming an effective tool for raising awareness. Recently the Kenyan news anchor @annekiguta was re-tweeting the fact that @jeffsachs was going live on the tweet chat in New York, while Al Jazeera's @PrernaSuriAJE was sharing her new film from Delhi. Organising the logistics of the tweet chat took quite a bit of preparation. A core team of global campaign staff based in Asia, Europe, Africa and the US was able to host particular sections of the discussion. We also partnered other organisations to promote an hour of the tweet chat so that it reached a new audience. For example, there was a big uplift when the WHO started promoting the discussion because of their global network. Similarly, Save the Children in the UK organised for restaurant critic @jayrayner1 to be in Rwanda for the launch. He joined the chat alongside the minister of health and also wrote about the visit in The Observer. Save the Children in the US worked with celebrity chef @catcora who tweeted about her recent visit to Ethiopia. We used a 'twebevent' platform to host the tweet chat as it gave the event an online home beyond Twitter. This site allowed us to live-stream press conferences in Geneva and New York and show other films throughout the day. The site is very straightforward so people not on Twitter could follow the event. This was particularly beneficial to many staff who wanted to follow proceedings. A common challenge for international NGOs running global events is finding the right spokespeople, or tweeters, who are genuinely interesting to the public. There is always a temptation to put forward your own internal experts for any public question-and-answer session. While it is important to have experts supporting the event, it is crucial to engage guests and be ambitious about who to target. Promoting a new issue is hard when there is so much noise out there, but by globalising our social media approach we were seeing individuals, staff, celebrities and other organisations highlight our issue and, in doing so, creating a far bigger reach than trying to do this on our own.

      "bodyText": "I am not an enthusiastic camper. Even luxurious tree cabins, Mongolian yurts and glamping safari lodges fail to enthral. But in the depths of my childhood memories there lurks a happy summer holiday in a then rather glamorous \"all mod cons\" caravan in Devon. So when I heard about a French campsite specialising in retro caravans, I couldn't resist its 1934 Winchester, made in England, and described, at the time, as the Rolls-Royce of caravans. The Domaine du Roc campsite is in rural Brittany, on the bank of the pretty Nantes-Brest canal. From outside, it looks like a typical campsite \u2013 log cabin office, grim concrete shower and toilet block. But the bubbly, friendly owners, Laurent and Myriam Rousseau, immediately make their guests feel at home. While the property extends to tents, mobile homes, tree cabins and strange-looking baricanes (giant wooden barrels from Estonia that look like Hobbit homes), their pride and joy is their collection of retro caravans. Every guest gets a tour of the caravans, beginning, of course, with our Winchester, which dates from a time when most of the population couldn't even afford a car, let alone a luxurious caravan to tow around. Next door is another English oddity, a 1956 Willerby Vogue, which reminds me of a Dinky toy. Heading into the 1960s, the shape and design of the caravans becomes more sleek and fashionable, with French and Belgian models La Sologne, La Tortue and Le Notin \u2013 and the strangley shaped Fleurette is 1970s psychedelic. The interiors are perfectly preserved in every detail, and furnished with objects that correspond to the era: travelling alarm clocks, transistor radios, Bakelite lamps, plus a faded magazine or newspaper from the era \u2013 Daily Telegraph for the Winchester, Paris Match for the Solange. The Winchester lives up to my expectations: in its incredible hand-crafted wooden interior, every inch is used for inventive ideas. The draining board tilts upwards so the water runs away, the crockery drawer has a large spring so nothing breaks when the caravan drives over a bump, and the wardrobe door folds out to close off half the caravan, creating an intimate bedroom. The dining table folds away, and if you pull a metal ring, the floor lifts up to reveal an enamel bathtub. Well, not really a tub, more a basin where you can squat while your partner pours water from billy cans \u2013 not something we tested. The only letdown is that none of the vans has electricity or running water because, Laurent tells me, complying with modern health and safety regulations would have cost a fortune. But there is a tent nearby with fridge and cooker, you can borrow a barbecue, and the toilets and showers are clean, if spartan. Laurent and Myriam are clearly people on a mission, intent on recreating, in their words \"the unique atmosphere of Les Trente Glorieuses\", the three decades \u2013 1950s, 1960s and 1970s \u2013 that were an age of innocence for summer holidays, when people were revelling in the right to a vacation, and camping and caravanning was the fun choice. They deliberately keep the campsite to two-star level, so there is no shop, restaurant or bar. Laurent believes in supporting the village, and expects campers to use its baker, butcher and bistro. Kids are expected to play ping-pong instead of PlayStation, a brilliant adventure park stretching across the treetops is as much fun for four-year-olds as unfit fortysomethings, and at a weekly free ap\u00e9ritif, guests gather in the woods to hear storytellers and actors tell haunting Breton myths. In the morning, we set up our folding table outside as Myriam comes round with breakfast \u2013 croissants and homemade jam on a laminate tray, tea and coffee in vintage thermos flasks. And to complete the retro scene, a classic 1966 Citroen DS Convertible cruises into the site, and parks right opposite us. A Breton family piles out for a stay in the Willerby, which they exclaim is \"Ooh, tr\u00e8s British!\". \u2022 A night for two with breakfast in a vintage caravan at Camping Domaine du Roc (+33 2 9774 9107, domaine-du-roc.com) costs from \u20ac55. Flybe (flybe.com) flies to Nantes from 11 British airports from \u00a390 return. Car hire at Nantes airport from \u00a360 a day through carrentals.co.uk.

      "bodyText": "China has cut its growth target to its lowest rate since 2004, the premier, Wen Jiabao announced on Monday, as it seeks to rebalance its economy. The target of 7.5% for 2012 reflects expectations that reduced exports due to the European crisis and a fragile US recovery could dampen growth in the world's second-largest economy. But by abandoning the longstanding 8% goal the government is also signalling its desire to reshape development. \"In setting a slightly lower GDP growth rate, we hope ... to guide people in all sectors to focus their work on accelerating the transformation of the pattern of economic development and making economic development more sustainable and efficient,\" Wen said. He was delivering his annual work report \u2013 the Chinese equivalent of the US state of the nation \u2013 at the opening of the National People's Congress, China's largely rubber-stamp parliament. The 3,000 representatives meet amid intense political manoeuvring ahead of this year's leadership transition. The current administration are nearing the end of their decade in power, with a new generation of leaders due to take power from later this year. Officials had already hinted at a reduction in the growth target, a largely symbolic figure that has been outpaced by actual growth rates each year. China's economy grew by 9.2% last year, down from 10.3% in 2010. \"We aim to promote steady and robust economic development, keep prices stable and guard against financial risks by keeping the total money and credit supply at an appropriate level, and taking a cautious and flexible approach,\" Wen said. The premier said his priority was boosting consumer demand and promised to improve policies encouraging consumption. \"We will vigorously adjust income distribution, increase the incomes of low- and middle-income groups and enhance people's ability to consume,\" he said. The government has repeatedly vowed to promote balanced growth and move away from exports and investments towards domestic consumption. But experts say it has made little progress. Wen set an inflation target of 4%, the same as last year, and renewed the government's pledge to curb speculation in the property market. He vowed to defuse rising local government debt, one of the main sources of concern economically. Local governments owed around 10.7tn yuan (\u00a31tn/$1.7tn) according to official figures from late 2010. \"We will strengthen supervision of local government debt and guard against risks. We will further investigate and regulate financing companies run by local governments,\" Wen said. He said China planned to increase government spending to 12.4tn yuan, up 14.1%, slightly more than half of which would come from the central government. That will help to cover another hefty bump in the domestic security budget, which will rise by 11.5% to 700bn yuan (\u00a370bn/$111bn) this year \u2013 reflecting the government's growing concern about instability \u2013 according to a ministry of finance report released on Monday. Spending has exceeded the official military budget since 2010, although this year may have seen extra pressure to up funding in the wake of the Arab spring and ahead of the leadership transition. Wen told representatives that the government had to \"effectively defuse various types of conflicts, risks and dangers; prevent isolated problems from growing into major ones; and promote social harmony and stability.\" Defence spending will increase by 11.2% to 670.3bn yuan (\u00a367bn/$106.4bn), China announced on Sunday.",

      "bodyText": "Lebanon is bracing itself for a new influx of Syrian refugees after up to 2,000 people fleeing the military onslaught in Homs were reported to be trying to reach the border. \"Between one and two thousand [Syrians] are in the process of coming from Syria to Lebanon,\" the UNHCR's deputy representative in Lebanon, Jean Paul Cavalieri, told Reuters. \"This is what we are hearing from our teams on the ground and local authorities.\" The exodus from Syria's third city has intensified since loyalist forces ousted the opposition Free Syria Army from the Baba Amr neighbourhood on Friday. There is little information about the fate of up to 20,000 residents thought to be there when the siege began four weeks ago. For the third day running, the International Committee for the Red Cross was denied access to Baba Amr despite earlier assurances that it could deliver aid to residents trapped in the fighting. A seven-truck ICRC convoy has been waiting since Friday to enter Baba Amr, with local military authorities saying aid officials were being kept out for their own safety because of the presence of bombs and landmines, which they allege were left by opposition forces. Activists and Free Syria Army officials vehemently deny having booby-trapped the area and say the regime has concocted a ruse to hide its activities there. The lack of access has drawn international condemnation, with Turkey and Britain accusing Damascus of committing grave crimes in the rebel-held neighbourhood. Prime minister David Cameron on Friday called for Mr Assad to \"face a day of reckoning\" in the wake of the relentless crackdown on dissent that started a year ago. Opposition activists who were forced to flee the regime's assault have accused security forces of conducting summary executions of men and boys over the age of 14 over the last three days. The claims cannot be substantiated, as the neighbourhood that for months had become a rebel stronghold has now lost all connections to the outside. The ICRC said it had been able to provide aid to the refugees who had made it to other parts of Homs, especially in the village of Abel, three kilometres away, where many refugees have fled. The global relief organisation said the needs in Abel and two other districts of Homs, Inshant and Tawzii, were \"considerable\". It has primarily been distributing food, baby milk, blankets and hygiene products. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Sunday that the true picture of the refugee situation in Homs will only become clear in the coming days. Heavy fighting broke out overnight between armoured forces loyal to Assad and rebels who launched co-ordinated attacks on army roadblocks across the southern city of Deraa on the border with Jordan, Reuters said on Monday, quoting opposition activists. The reports of the fighting in Deraa, where the uprising against Assad's rule began last March, could not be independently verified. But opposition sources said rebels had intensified assaults on loyalist targets in southern, north and eastern Syria in the last few days to relieve pressure in Homs. The Wadi Khaled region of Lebanon's far north had until late last year been an escape route for scores of families and defectors who had fled the deteriorating situation in Homs, lying only 50km northeast of the border. However, regime forces laid land mines and began aggressively patrolling the area in November, closing off most exits. Those fleeing Homs have few other options, apart from a dangerous journey south to Lebanon's Bekaa valley through land that is contested by the Free Syria Army and the Syrian military. A Syrian man who spoke to the Guardian said a small number of people had crossed into the Bekaa valley after walking for more than a day from near Homs. The Bekaa is viewed by the refugees, who are almost all Sunni Muslims, as a less appealing option, because it is a stronghold of Shia Muslims, many of whom are aligned with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Meanwhile, the United Nations' commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, has again warned that supplying weapons to Syrian rebels will worsen the situation in the country, where more than 7,500 people have died in a year long uprising that shows few signs of losing steam. \"Any kind of provision of military equipment to the opposition, in my view, will escalate the violence and not lead to the goal we are trying to achieve,\" said Pillay. \"I think that countries should be focusing their energy on achieving a peaceful resolution here, and to ensure that the root causes are addressed.\" Qatar and Saudi Arabia have both endorsed the supply of weapons to opposition fighters, who are a mix of military deserters and citizens who have taken up arms. However, the US and Europe have shown no appetite for running guns to irregular forces, perhaps because they believe the rebels have little hope of defeating the Syrian army militarily. Chastened by the Iraq war and wary of overtly backing another rebel militia after Libya, the US has instead imposed a series of sanctions against Syrian officials and has tried to muster support for a UN resolution that lays the groundwork for Assad to leave. But even two watered-down versions, which did not demand Assad's exit, have been vetoed by Syria's allies, Russia and China, who have shown no sign that their support for Assad regime is wavering. \"There is no viable option at this point but to keep the pressure on diplomatically and economically,\" one western official said. \"The military option is not flying, as tempting as it may be.\" Meanwhile, pro- and anti-Assad rallies paralysed central Beirut on Sunday. Tensions have been simmering in the Lebanese capital, which has been under Syrian tutelage since its civil war. The tribulations of its restive neighbour are playing out in Lebanon's brittle political scene and there are mounting fears that a crumbling power base in Damascus would have a dire effect on Lebanese society. There were no reports of violence at rallies, with the two sides separated by barbed wire and a large military presence.",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to a new regular selection of the best north American sports clips on the web, from the sublime to the ridiculous. Just click on the links. 1. Songs In The Key Of Lin In today's world, you're an absolute nobody if someone hasn't made an auto-tune assisted hip-hop anthem in your honor. New York Knicks point guard and worldwide sensation Jeremy Lin has, as you would imagine, inspired quite a few over the last month. Of the homemade videos I've watched, I believe \"All I Do Is Lin\") has the most staying power. It's not as catchy as the Tim Tebow inspired \"All He Does Is Win\", but it more than makes up for that by not featuring even a trace of Skip Bayless. For the more rock and roll inclined, comedian/talk show host Jimmy Fallon channeled his inner Eddie Vedder with \"Jeremy (Lin)\" which I just can't fully endorse. Pearl Jam's original \"Jeremy\" is, after all, about a school shooting and that doesn't seem fitting in light of Lin's most recent performances. Is there a Pearl Jam song about a school with high teacher turnover rates? 2. Devin Setoguchi Wipes Out \"Okay, Devin, after reviewing the film, can you pinpoint exactly what went wrong on this play?\" 3. The Face This is a brief profile of Alabama basketball supporter Jack Blankenship who has created a gimmick for distracting opposing players that also doubles as the last thing you see before you die. 4. MMA Fighter Knocks Himself Out Exactly what it sounds like. 5. Pete Weber: Paragon of Humility I think professional bowler Pete Weber is paying homage here to Bill Murray's villainous role in the movie \"Kingpin\", except instead of humorous and amusing he's aiming for something closer to embarrassing and borderline psychotic. 6. Blue Jays Catcher Impersonates Baseball Analyst Tim Kurkjian (The Toronto Blue Jays Locker Room. Catcher J.P. Arencibia approaches outfielder Jose Bautista.) J.P.: Hey, Jose, I'm going to break down your swing on Baseball Tonight, is that okay? Jose: No offense but that sounds boring. J.P.: Well, I'll be doing it with my famous impression. It'll be funny. Jose: Your famous impression? Who? Jack Nicholson? Elvis Presley? Howard Cosell? J.P.: Tim Kurkjian. Jose: Tim Kurkjian? The high-pitched \"Baseball Tonight\" anchor? J.P.: Yeah, I've spent years perfecting my Tim Kurkjian impression just for this moment. Jose: Years? To develop an impression of someone that like .00001% of the population could possibly recognize? Why? J.P.: That's\u2026 That's a good question. I don't know. I never thought why. I spent all that time perfecting my impression\u2026 My god\u2026 I have wasted my youth. (Silence) Jose: J.P.? I didn't mean to offend you or\u2026 J.P.: (Glumly) I need to be alone with my thoughts. Jose: I\u2026 I understand. (Leaves.) J.P.: I knew I should have impersonated Terry Francona instead. 7. Clipper Darrell, Cheerleading The man with the moves is the Artist Formerly Known as Clipper Darrell. For years, \"Clipper Darrell\" was well known for being Los Angeles 's other team's biggest fan. Not that there was much competition for that honor until this year, when the post-Chris Paul trade Clippers became truly relevant for perhaps the first time. Since this, of course, is the Clippers organization, they honored their longtime unofficial mascot by demanding that he no longer call himself Clipper Darrell and then they proceeded to defame him with an unnecessarily mean press release. It's good to know that win or lose, the Clippers remain the Clippers. 8. NFL Network Commentator Rich Eisen Participates In Combine No offense to Mr. Eisen, a good sport and anything but a twit, but I can't watch this clip without thinking of a certain classic Monty Python skit. 9. Portland Chariot-Bike Race When the hipsters finally take over the world like they have Portland, this will replace NASCAR. It's not as fast or as exciting, but the carbon footprint is minimal and nobody has to shill for detergent. 10. Classic: Nolan Ryan Vs Robin Ventura When news broke that Chicago White Sox GM Kenny Williams had hired Robin Ventura as his new manager, \"Nolan Ryan\" began trending on Twitter. That's how legendary this pitcher-batter brawl has become. Even better, Nolan Ryan is now part owner of the Texas Rangers, which leads to the possibility that at the start the next White Sox/Rangers game, Nolan Ryan will be asked to throw the ceremonial first punch. As with our big brother Classic Youtube blog, please feel free to share your favourites below for inclusion in next week's blog.",

      "bodyText": "A quintessentially Canadian winter tradition \u2013 outdoor ice hockey \u2013 could be facing extinction within decades because of climate change, a new study says. Pick-up games of ice hockey, also called shinny or pond hockey, are a way of life during the long winters. Many towns are studded with neighbourhood ice rinks, some families even freeze over their backyards. Ottawa has the Rideau Canal, the 5-mile skate run through the nation's capital. But such pursuits are in peril as milder winters and earlier springs pare down the outdoor ice season. The ice season has shortened noticeably over the last 50 years, especially in southern British Columbia and Alberta and parts of the prairie provinces, the study in the Institute of Physics' journal, Environmental Research Letters, says. Temperatures are not staying low enough long enough to allow ice to freeze over. By mid-century, it may no longer be possible to play ice hockey or skate on outdoor rinks without artificial intervention. \"If you draw a straight line into the future you get zero rink-flooding days by mid-century which implies that at some point in that period you can't build a rink because it is not getting cold enough,\" said Damon Matthews, a geographer at Concordia University and author of the study. That prospect might even be enough to alarm the prime minister, Stephen Harper, who has come under growing criticism in the international community and at home for reneging on Canada's commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and for his aggressive promotion of the Alberta tar sands, which have a heavier carbon imprint than traditional crude. \"I think this is going to strike a chord with Canadians,\" Matthews said. \"When I think of things that are vulnerable to climate change that people care about in Canada I would place outdoor ice hockey very close to the top of that list.\" It takes a long cold spell to be able to build a good foundation for ice sports \u2013 at least three days in a row at -5C, the researchers determined, from interviews with public rink officials. But temperature records from 142 weather stations across the southern belt of Canada, where most of the population lives, showed a distinct warming trend from 1951-2005. According to the criteria set by rink officials, many of those locations would have experienced later start dates for outdoor skating over the years. Most showed shorter seasons, as much as 20 to 30% shorter in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba and parts of western Ontario. Only Atlantic Canada showed a longer season. \"We would expect all regions of Canada to see a decreased viability of outdoor skating under continued winter climate warming,\" the paper says. In the most extreme case of the southwest Canada region ... the number of viable rink flooding days could reach zero by mid-century.\" The results should not be surprising, said Simon Donner, a climate scientist at the University of British Columbia. Temperatures in Canada have increased by more than 2.5C since 1950, which is about three times the global average of warming attributed to climate change. Canadian cities are becoming warmer because of increasing urbanisation, but there is no missing the evidence on the ground of climate change. \"The study gels very much with the observations we have for changes in ice,\" Donner said. \"This is a theoretical result but we have observations from across Canada showing that the length of time that lakes would remain frozen during the winter has been decreasing, so it follows from that.\"",

They stuttered against Italy in February and stumbled in Edinburgh, but this was going to be their moment, a burst of spring at home against opponents who do not like Paris at any time of year. But no, it was another fitful performance that began with a laboured pass by Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie, intercepted by Tommy Bowe, and ended with two drop-goal attempts by Lionel Beauxis, shots that threatened to mow the grass at the Stade de France but not pass over the bar. It was tatty stuff by Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9's team, and took them out of the reckoning for any grand slam showdown in Cardiff on the final day of the Six Nations. It leaves France in contention for the title, a tribute to the moments in between the lapses when they revealed their more elegant selves. Wesley Fofana is rattling along at a try per game in his short international career and remains the elusive heart of the French mission to inject grace and menace in equal measure to their midfield. Rougerie, his senior partner at both Clermont Auvergne and here in the national team looked horribly clumsy alongside junior. Having been idle and careless in the first half, France seemed to have shamed themselves back into contention, overhauling the 11-point deficit and taking control, if not on the scoreboard, where the teams were tied, but in the scrum and lineout and in the general sense of being French and on a roll and unstoppable. That Ireland regrouped and held out for the rest of the game was remarkable in its own right. Rob Kearney gave another towering performance at full-back, his catching of the high ball while running in any direction an example of what the human arms and hands can catch when eyes do not budge from the object. The tacklers also used their limbs and eyes to hold out, counting the numbers, placing defenders and repositioning them, slowing the ball down without yielding a penalty and hanging on to opposition flesh and shirts without giving away an inch of territory. Given the defensive effort it was not surprising that when their rare moment came in the second period to break out and score, they fell into the same trap of carelessness as the first-half French. Gordon D'Arcy dropped a ball for no reason at all in the French 22; Jamie Heaslip let it slip from his grasp on halfway with 30 seconds left on the clock. France's errors told of a team nowhere near where they should be in March, while Ireland's spoke of a heroic effort that dragged a team to the extremes of exhaustion. French errors flattened the drama; Ireland's made it. Nobody tackled with greater commitment than Jonathan Sexton, who charged up with an appetite that would be the envy of many players twice his size and weight. The choke-and-hold tackle, the speciality of Paul O'Connell, also went well, although the captain was not his dominant self at the lineout. What Ireland gave away in the second half, they regained with a collective refusal to capitulate. Not many teams face France in the mood in Paris and survive with scores level. The Irish players did not exactly raise their arms at the sound of a final whistle, but this was a positive result. For France it was a burst balloon. There was, as is the norm this year, an interesting little issue involving the referee. Dave Pearson opted to allow Cian Healy to stay on the field even though the prop was offside by several kilometres during one of France's infrequent passages of flowing play in the first half. This was one of those \"loitering\" penalties, when the vagrant is drifting back into home territory with his hands held above his head, pitifully innocent but most definitely in the way. Healy stayed on and Morgan Parra missed the penalty, one of those indications that perhaps this was not going to be the home side's day. It wasn't and their sap failed to rise. France have the advantage of playing at home next, against England, but perhaps their moment has passed, blossom nipped by the frost. Fearing France in the spring has long haunted all those who come to Paris, but this may have reduced the sting. What moved on this bonus, rearranged Sunday was green: Tommy Bowe's brace of tries and the entire Irish team's willingness to keep France at bay. The Irish spring.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Jackson's back catalogue has allegedly been stolen from Sony Music by hackers, it has emerged. More than 50,000 music files, most of which were by the late pop legend, are said to have been illegally downloaded. Jackson's estate signed the biggest recording deal in history, worth $250m (\u00a3164m) with the company in 2010, giving it the rights to sell his whole back catalogue as well as previously unreleased tracks. On Friday, two men who were arrested last May appeared in court in the UK accused of offences in connection with the alleged security breach. James Marks, 26, from Daventry in Northamptonshire, and James McCormick, 25, from Blackpool, denied charges under the Computer Misuse Act and the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act at Leicester crown court. They were released on bail, the Serious Organised Crime Agency said. They are due to stand trial next January. The incident comes less than a year after the names, addresses and other personal data of about 77 million people with accounts on Sony's PlayStation Network (PSN) were stolen. The company warned it had been hacked last April when an \"illegal and unauthorised person\" got access to the information, forcing Sony to temporarily shut down the PSN, which allows owners of the consoles to play online games and rent films. Private investigators were called in and Sony issued an apology for the \"frustrating\" security breach, promising it was taking steps to make its services \"safer and more secure than ever before\" in the wake of the attack. Sony Music is home to a string of major artists, including Leonard Cohen, Paul Simon, Foo Fighters and Avril Lavigne, and also distributes the music of Jimi Hendrix. Its catalogue features what it calls \"some of the most important recordings in history\". The company signed its contract with Jackson's estate nine months after he died from a drug overdose at the age of 50, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of debt behind him. The deal also entitled the firm to use his music in computer games, television adverts and elsewhere, with profits from the arrangement to go into a trust shared by the singer's mother and three children. Sony Music declined to comment on the latest alleged hacking incident. Soca's involvement in the case comes after it shut down popular music site RnBXclusive last month, warning users that the majority of music files available via the website were stolen from the artists.",

They are due to stand trial next January.</p> <p>The incident comes less than a year after the names, addresses and other personal data of about 77 million people with accounts on Sony's PlayStation Network (PSN) were stolen.</p> <p>The company warned it had been hacked last April when an \"illegal and unauthorised person\" got access to the information, forcing Sony to temporarily shut down the PSN, which allows owners of the consoles to play online games and rent films.</p> <p>Private investigators were called in and Sony issued an apology for the \"frustrating\" security breach, promising it was taking steps to make its services \"safer and more secure than ever before\" in the wake of the attack.</p> <p>Sony Music is home to a string of major artists, including Leonard Cohen, Paul Simon, Foo Fighters and Avril Lavigne, and also distributes the music of Jimi Hendrix.</p> <p>Its catalogue features what it calls \"some of the most important recordings in history\".</p> <p>The company signed its contract with Jackson's estate nine months after he died from a drug overdose at the age of 50, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of debt behind him.</p> <p>The deal also entitled the firm to use his music in computer games, television adverts and elsewhere, with profits from the arrangement to go into a trust shared by the singer's mother and three children.</p> <p>Sony Music declined to comment on the latest alleged hacking incident.</p> <p>Soca's involvement in the case comes after it shut down popular music site RnBXclusive last month, warning users that the majority of music files available via the website were stolen from the artists.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barack Obama has admonished Israel for \"too much loose talk of war\" with Iran and said the world has a responsibility to give sanctions an opportunity to discourage Tehran from pursuing a nuclear weapon. Speaking before a meeting on Monday with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, Obama sought to head off pressure for him to commit to military action against Tehran if it crosses specified \"red lines\" in its nuclear programme. The president told a sceptical audience at the annual conference of America's most influential pro-Israel lobby group that he accepts a \"basic truth\" that no Israeli government can tolerate Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and that he therefore understands the \"profound historical obligation\" weighing on the shoulders of Israel's leaders. Obama said explicitly that he is prepared to use force against Iran to defend US interests if necessary, but he chastised those who appear to be in a hurry for war in comments apparently aimed at Israeli officials who have been making belligerent noises. \"I would ask that we all remember the weightiness of these issues; the stakes involved for Israel, for America, and for the world. Already, there is too much loose talk of war,\" he told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). \"Over the last few weeks, such talk has only benefited the Iranian government, by driving up the price of oil, which they depend upon to fund their nuclear programme. For the sake of Israel's security, America's security, and the peace and security of the world, now is not the time for bluster; now is the time to let our increased pressure sink in, and to sustain the broad international coalition that we have built. \" Now is the time to heed that timeless advice from Teddy Roosevelt: speak softly, but carry a big stick.\" Obama pleased Aipac delegates by saying he would not pursue a policy of \"containment\" of a nuclear-armed Iran \u2013 a commitment Aipac has been pressing through support of resolutions in Congress. He also said that he \"will take no option off the table\" and that includes \"a military effort to be prepared for any contingency\". \"I will not hesitate to use force when it is necessary to defend the United States and its interests,\" he said. But Netanyahu wants Obama to go further and commit to the use of force if Iran crosses agreed \"red lines\" in the development of its nuclear programme. In his response to the speech, Netanyahu said he appreciated Obama's reiteration that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons: \"Perhaps most important of all, I appreciated the fact that he said that Israel must be able to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.\" But the Israeli leader also set the stage for what is likely to be a difficult meeting with Obama by saying that he will go his own way if he finds it necessary. Netanyahu warned on Friday that the international community should not fall into the \"trap\" of negotiating while Iran continues its \"relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons\". He said that the international community should demand the immediate dismantling of Iran's underground nuclear facility in Qom and a halt to uranium enrichment. Israel's president, Shimon Peres, pressed the point when he told the conference on Sunday that Iran was an evil and corrupt regime and \"an affront to human dignity\". \"It must be stopped, and it will be stopped,\" he said. \"If we are forced to fight, trust me, we shall prevail.\" US officials have made clear the president will not set the \"red lines\" wanted by Netanyahu out of concern it will be interpreted by the Israelis as a tacit endorsement of an attack if Iran fails to meet demands. Obama is instead expected to repeat in private to Netanyahu what he has said in public \u2013 that there is time for sanctions and diplomacy to work. \"I firmly believe that an opportunity remains for diplomacy \u2013 backed by pressure \u2013 to succeed. The United States and Israel both assess that Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon, and we are exceedingly vigilant in monitoring their programme. Now, the international community has a responsibility to use the time and space that exists,\" he said to virtual silence from the Aipac delegates. \"Iran's leaders still have the opportunity to make the right decision. They can choose a path that brings them back into the community of nations, or they can continue down a dead end. \"Given their history, there are of course no guarantees that the Iranian regime will make the right choice. But both Israel and the United States have an interest in seeing this challenge resolved diplomatically. After all, the only way to truly solve this problem is for the Iranian government to make a decision to forsake nuclear weapons. That's what history tells us.\" Obama went on to say that the experience of sending Americans to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan had left him in no hurry for a war in Iran. \"As president and commander-in-chief, I have a deeply-held preference for peace over war. I have sent men and women into harm's way,\" he said. \"For this reason, as part of my solemn obligation to the American people, I will only use force when the time and circumstances demand it. And I know that Israeli leaders also know all too well the costs and consequences of war, even as they recognise their obligation to defend their country.\" Like every other president of recent times, Obama restated to Aipac the \"unbreakable bonds\" between the US and Israel and his own commitment to the Jewish state. But he sounded unusually defensive in the face of Republican accusations that he is endangering Israel's security with his Iran policy and that he has been \"anti-Israel\" by pressing Netanyahu to take peace negotiations with the Palestinians seriously, beginning with a halt to continued construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. \"As you examine my commitment, you don't just have to count on my words. You can look at my deeds. Because over the last three years, as president of the United States, I have kept my commitments to the state of Israel. At every crucial juncture, at every fork in the road\u201a we have been there for Israel. Every single time,\" he said.",

But last week the government released the results of 80,000 interviews designed to supplement measures of wealth with measures of wellbeing, and Northern Ireland emerged as the UK's happiest corner. The regional differences weren't vast \u2013 sunnily disposed subjects were everywhere the norm \u2013 but the passing of the Troubles may have encouraged Ulster to count its blessings. It's not just past history but present economic precariousness which makes the result impressive.

An All-Russian Public Opinion Research Centre poll back in mid February put Putin on 53.5%, already an outright first round win and 42 points ahead of his nearest rival, the communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. So last night's initial exit poll figures giving him around 59%, did not look wildly out of line. The real issues are how he won, and where he lost. Hours before the first results, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny called the violations that had taken place yesterday irrefutable, and a Moscow Times photographer snapped a busload of hired hands moving from one polling station to another in the Kurkino district of northwest Moscow, evidence of the so-called voting carousel. The bussing in of Putin supporters to the capital, to boost his vote in a city that would have humiliated him had it been left to vote freely, was so extensive and so blatant that one member of the nationalist pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi admitted to our reporter that he had been transported to the city just to vote. Navalny's claims of widespread election fraud were soon followed by the communist party, who said that they could not consider the elections free or fair after the volume of complaints they had received. The battle that will unfold over the next 24 hours will be less over the fact that Putin got re-elected as president than it will be over the cheating that went on. The national result will radicalise his opponents less effectively than the local one. The gap between the official result in Moscow and St Petersburg, and what Muscovites and Peterburgers know to be true in their own city districts, is what will fuel the demonstrations due to take place today. Having already had one vote stolen from them in December, this will feel like a second slap in the face. Whether such tactics were wise for a president, who would have won anyway, is dubious indeed. Last night in his victory speech he appealed for unity, but mass demos and a strong police presence are no way to foster that. After the collapse of the popularity of his party, United Russia, in December, Putin needs to build a party and a new consensus. It will have to be a coalition if it is to address the core issues that brought so many of Russia's best and brightest out on to the streets. He has thus far made minimal concessions to the democratic awakening stirred in December. He had changed the laws on registering parties and candidates at future elections, but touched little else. Even his supporters do not know how Putin can avoid stagnation if he continues on the same path.

      "bodyText": "Dear Secretary of State, On Tuesday 6th March, hundreds of older and disabled people, their families and carers will travel to Westminster with the same message for Parliament: we must end the crisis in our social care system. They will speak for the millions of individuals and families we represent who are in desperate need of care and either going without or receiving inadequate support. Years of underfunding, combined with rising demand have resulted in a social care system that is in crisis: an unfair and confusing postcode lottery which is now facing additional cuts. This is a challenge which successive Governments have failed to overcome \u2013 but we cannot wait any longer. The groundwork for action has been laid. Your Government acted quickly to set up the Dilnot Commission on funding social care which reported last year. Alongside the Law Commission recommendations about community care law, this report sets out a roadmap for a sustainable and clear social care system. As you prepare to publish a White Paper on social care this Spring, older and disabled people and their families need the Government to deliver on both fronts: the funding and legal foundation of social care. Social care law needs to give everyone confidence that they will have access to quality care, when they need it, wherever they live. But a new framework without additional funding will not address the fundamental challenge: the shocking fact that at a time when more people need care, the numbers getting support from social care services are decreasing. Those who do get support are often shocked by the cost and the quality. If the plans published later in the Spring do not answer the question of additional funding, they will fail. As they meet you and other MPs on Tuesday, to ask you to seize this opportunity to act, older and disabled people and their families want to know that they are not going to be let down again. Without decisions on funding, all they will hear are empty promises. We urge you to build on the foundation the Government has achieved so far, and deliver sustainable, funded reform for those families.

      "bodyText": "The government's NHS reform bill could increase the dangers facing vulnerable children, according to a survey of the risk assessments produced by primary care trusts in response to the legislation. The analysis of the risk assessments drawn up by the 54 PCTs, the organisations that manage and pay for patient care in England, found children in danger of being physically abused could suffer because of problems and weaknesses caused by the restructuring. They claim child protection procedures are threatened by issues such as fragmentation between new organisations that are being created in the shakeup, making it hard for staff to swap information about sensitive or complicated cases where there is suspicion of neglect or abuse by relatives or carers. Safeguarding processes have been tightened up after the death in London in August 2007 of 17-month-old Peter Connelly who sustained injuries at the hands of his mother, her boyfriend and their lodger, that were missed by social workers and NHS staff. But the risk analysis produced by a group of five PCTs in south-east London and the Bexley care trust in late January said: \"There is a risk that children's safeguarding arrangements may not be satisfactory, caused by insufficient rigour of processes and capacity during the transition, leading to individuals potentially being placed in an unsafe environment or receiving uncontrolled care .\" It classified the danger as a \"possible\" risk which, if it occurred, would have \"catastrophic\" consequences. The \"transition\" it refers to is the period until the new organisational structure of the NHS in England starts in April 2013. Similarly, Milton Keynes and Northamptonshire PCT's risk analysis, also agreed in January, outlined \"significant harm or fatalities of children and vulnerable adults\" as one of the \"underlying significant/high operational risks\" facing it as a result of the shakeup. The problems identified by such reports echo a letter to the Lancet medical journal signed by 154 paediatricians calling on government to drop the health bill because they fear the fragmentation and pressure on health workers would have \"an extremely damaging effect on the healthcare of children and their families\". PCTs blame the shakeup directly for other hazards facing the NHS. Sandwell PCT, for example, fears it could be \"so busy looking at internal structures, clustering [and] separation that it fails on improving care quality for patients, service redesign and making the difference needed for Sandwell people\", while North Yorkshire and York PCT fears a \"decrease in staff morale, attendance, [and an] increase in sickness levels due to badly managed organisational change.\" The health and social care bill, which ministers hope will have passed parliament within weeks, will set up complex new structures in England's NHS in April 2013. GP-led clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) will replace PCTs as the bodies which commission and pay for treatments, with PCTs and strategic health authorities being scrapped. Unions representing hundreds of thousands of NHS workers will step up their opposition to the Government's controversial health reforms this week by holding a protest outside Parliament. Nurses, midwives, doctors, physiotherapists, cleaners, porters and other employees will join the demonstration in Westminster on Wednesday as the Health and Social Care Bill enters its final parliamentary stages. And 38 Degrees, the online campaigning community, said 20,000 of its members of have donated \u00a3280,000 in three days to pay for more than 180 billboards across London calling on the prime minister to reconsider the reforms. The risk analyses are public documents which are produced by PCTs to help their boards smooth the transition to the new system. They also identify the upheaval involved in the reforms as being a \"distraction\" from the demanding job of providing good quality healthcare, and leading to poor staff morale, key personnel leaving and public health programmes suffering. Some fear they will not be able to deliver their share of the NHS's \u00a320bn savings drive, respond fully to a major incident or ensure that CCGs are properly established by next April. These new disclosures come as the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, prepares for a two-day hearing starting on Monday at the Information Rights Tribunal into his refusal to publish the Department of Health's own NHS transition risk register setting out its view of the risks involved in the shakeup. Labour and many medical leaders have called for its release so peers can use its contents to properly assess the bill. Andy Burnham, Labour's shadow health secretary, accused the government of gambling with children's health. \"The government is insulting parliament by asking MPs and peers to approve far-reaching changes to our country's best-loved institution without providing information on all the risks of doing so at this time of unprecedented financial pressure,\" said Burnham. \"Local NHS risk assessments already provide plentiful evidence for this bill to be stopped in its tracks with immediate effect. The scale of the risks ministers are taking with patient and children's safety is breath-taking. They should be stopped before they cause real harm.\" Many of the PCTs' risk assessments identify the potential failure of safeguarding procedures for children, and often vulnerable adults too. Any such failings may mean that the NHS organisations concerned were in breach of their legal duties to protect at-risk children. The north-west London group of PCTs' analysis links the ability to safeguard the vulnerable directly to the plethora of new bodies and also Lansley's drive to reduce the NHS's stock of managers by 45%. It cites \"Failure to comply with safeguarding policies (children)\" and \"lack of information sharing as a result of reconfiguration under management cost reduction\" as risks which could lead to \"Failure to prevent harm to children. Services for children and young people may become fragmented and/or diluted, which will impact on the safeguarding functions to protect children.\" An equivalent exercise in Birmingham and Solihull last month raised the prospect of the local NHS being unable to maintain the \"resilience\" of its \"health visiting workforce resulting in potential inability to deliver on early prevention, leading to potential risk in safeguarding children\". It also said; \"Transition to the new system architecture may lead to a fragmentation of children's services\". The leader of Britain's children's doctors voiced concern. \"All risk registers will consider the worst case scenario but it's troubling that fragmentation of services has been highlighted as such a serious risk amongst these PCTs\", said Professor Terence Stephenson, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. \"Everyone knows how important it is to join up health care and social care and it remains one the most challenging priorities for professionals working with children. It's crucial that any impact of the reforms on safeguarding for children is anticipated and robust guidance sets out clearly how agencies will work together during this time of turbulence\", added Stephenson. Jan Norman, director of nursing for the Milton Keynes and Northamptonshire PCT, said they had considered a \"combination\" of factors before identifying children being harmed or even killed as a risk and cited three potential problems. \"Clearly in any reorganisation there's a tendency for people to be distracted because suddenly there's uncertainty about jobs, the future's unclear, the organisational form is unclear, so people may take their eye off the ball,\" she said. \"Obviously in transition to new organisations that haven't had responsibility previously for prevention of harm we have to be realistic about the fact that people in that transition may take time to get up to speed about how they best discharge those responsibilities. And of course there are risks in that change we'll lose key personnel: people with expertise and professionalism, or simply people closely involve in that agency and have the organisational history and broad links\", Norman added. A Department of Health spokesman said: \"Robust measures are in place to continue to protect children as management arrangements are changed. \"Departmental risk registers are management tools that play a key role in the formation of Government policy. They are separate and independent to Strategic Health Authority risk registers, which include all risks identified by a regional health board. \"The departmental risk register is solely about identifying and preparing for those risks involved in the Health Bill and associated changes to the system.\"",

The \"transition\" it refers to is the period until the new organisational structure of the NHS in England starts in April 2013.</p> <p>Similarly, Milton Keynes and Northamptonshire PCT's risk analysis, also agreed in January, outlined \"significant harm or fatalities of children and vulnerable adults\" as one of the \"underlying significant/high operational risks\" facing it as a result of the shakeup.</p> <p>The problems identified by such reports echo a letter to the Lancet medical journal signed by 154 paediatricians calling on government to drop the health bill because they fear the fragmentation and pressure on health workers would have \"an extremely damaging effect on the healthcare of children and their families\".</p> <p>PCTs blame the shakeup directly for other hazards facing the NHS.

      "bodyText": "Pressure is being piled upon the beleaguered health secretary, Andrew Lansley with a blunt warning from groups representing millions of elderly and disabled people that they will not stand for \"empty promises\" on reform of care funding. In a joint letter to Lansley, the biggest ever alliance of charities, care home organisations and housing providers says the government must not duck its commitment to deliver reform when it publishes a social care white paper later this year. The warning comes amid reports that Downing Street fears the white paper could turn into a repetition of the government's NHS shake-up, the poor presentation of which is widely blamed on Lansley. Officials at No 10 are said to have stepped in to influence the policy process. Ministers are believed to have some political cover as a consequence of all-party talks on care funding reform, which have begun behind the scenes in parallel with preparation of the white paper. The letter to Lansley comes before a planned mass lobby of parliament on Tuesday by elderly and disabled people, organised by the Care and Support Alliance. The alliance is pressing for implementation of the funding reforms for England proposed last year by a commission led by economist Andrew Dilnot. Among the 46 organisations that have signed the letter are leading charities such as Age UK, Macmillan Cancer Support and Scope; the English Community Care Association and the National Care Forum, representing the main care home chains; and specialist housing providers such as Anchor Trust and Home Group. Describing the Dilnot proposals as part of \"a roadmap for a sustainable and clear social care system\", the letter says: \"Years of underfunding, combined with rising demand, have resulted in a social care system that is in crisis: an unfair and confusing postcode lottery \u2026 now facing additional cuts. \"This is a challenge which successive governments have failed to overcome \u2013 but we cannot wait any longer.\" Dilnot has called for a cap on individual liability for care costs, to be set at perhaps \u00a335,000, to stop people facing catastrophic bills and having to use almost all their savings and the value of their homes. But introducing his plan in full would cost an initial \u00a31.7bn a year and rising. Amid clear signs of divisions in Whitehall, ministers have already decoupled the funding question from legal reforms and other issues that will be tackled in the white paper \u2014 not now expected before June \u2013 and have announced that a \"progress report\" on the all-party talks and wider thinking will be published alongside it. The letter warns that decisive action is expected on \"both fronts\" and that the white paper will fail without a funding solution. \"As they meet you and other MPs on Tuesday, to ask you to seize this opportunity to act,\" it tells Lansley, \"older and disabled people and their families want to know that they are not going to be let down again. Without decisions on funding, all they will hear are empty promises.\" Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the MS Society and chair of the alliance, said the spring was \"crunch time\" for Lansley to address the crisis that was engulfing the social care system. \"The health secretary faces the opportunity of a lifetime to ensure that this government's pledges are not just empty promises, and to make his mark on a social care system that will deliver for the next 20 years,\" Gillespie said. In a statement, Paul Burstow, care services minister, agreed the care system was in \"urgent need\" of reform to create a more sustainable system that provided more choice and control to individuals and their carers. \"We have to get this right,\" Burstow said. \"That is why we have been engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, people who use services and carers on the priorities for social care reform. \"We will publish our white paper on care and support and a progess report on funding reform in the spring.\"",

      "bodyText": "Tesco will on Monday announce plans to create 20,000 jobs over the next two years as it attempts to turn around its struggling UK business. The supermarket shocked investors in January by warning that UK profits could fall this year after it suffered its worst Christmas in decades, and last week brought more bad news for the company as it saw its market share fall to 29.7%, the lowest for almost seven years. Its poor performance prompted Tesco boss Philip Clarke, who took over from Sir Terry Leahy last year, to say the store chain had to change tack. It has vowed to spend millions of pounds \u2013 as much as \u00a3300m according to some reports \u2013 on improving the quality of its fresh food, its choice of products and its customer service. It has conducted trials in 200 stores to determine how to win back dissatisfied customers, and is employing more staff and improving training as a direct result of the feedback it received. Richard Brasher, Tesco's UK chief executive, said: \"We will invest in more staff on the sales floor at busy times, greater expertise and help in the crucial areas of fresh food and enhanced quality and service across our stores at all times.\" As part of the new investment, Tesco will refurbish hundreds of its existing stores as well as opening new outlets, although it is expected to concentrate on smaller stores rather than hypermarkets. Many of the new jobs will be aimed at young people who are unemployed, said Tesco. The company is already part of the government's controversial work experience scheme, which ran into criticism and was subsequently altered so young people would not lose their benefits if they left early. Tesco has so far offered 1,500 work experience placements with a similar number to follow. After protests that the company was using benefit claimants as unpaid labour, Tesco said the second 1,500 would have the choice of staying in the scheme and keeping their benefits or being paid by Tesco, with a view to being offered a permanent job if all went well. Any jobs created in this fashion would be part of the 20,000 announced on Monday. Tesco also plans to expand its apprenticeship programme to provide another 10,000 places, either for existing staff or new starters. Again, any new jobs will be part of the overall total. David Cameron welcomed the announcement as \"a massive confidence boost for the UK economy\" from the country's biggest private sector employer. At the moment more than a million 16- to 24-year-olds are unemployed and Brasher said major businesses had \"a big responsibility to step forward, invest and create jobs\". Tesco's UK business has been the engine of growth which allowed it to expand overseas, but analysts are concerned about the implications of a slowdown in its home market. Before the January update they had been expecting Tesco's profits to rise 10% this year, but now the performance is forecast to remain flat. The company's \u00a3500m \"Big Price Drop\" at the end of last year was dubbed the \"Big Price Flop\" by the City, but this has not prevented the company from sticking with the scheme. A fourth wave of discounting has recently begun under the \"New Price Drop\" slogan.",

The company is already part of the government's controversial work experience scheme, which ran into criticism and was subsequently altered so young people would not lose their benefits if they left early.</p> <p>Tesco has so far offered 1,500 work experience placements with a similar number to follow. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/21/tesco-paid-jobs-work-experience?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">protests that the company was using benefit claimants as unpaid labour</a>, Tesco said the second 1,500 would have the choice of staying in the scheme and keeping their benefits or being paid by Tesco, with a view to being offered a permanent job if all went well. Any jobs created in this fashion would be part of the 20,000 announced on Monday.</p> <p>Tesco also plans to expand its apprenticeship programme to provide another 10,000 places, either for existing staff or new starters. Again, any new jobs will be part of the overall total.</p> <p>David Cameron welcomed the announcement as \"a massive confidence boost for the UK economy\" from the country's biggest private sector employer.</p> <p>At the moment more than a million 16- to 24-year-olds are unemployed and Brasher said major businesses had \"a big responsibility to step forward, invest and create jobs\".</p> <p>Tesco's UK business has been the engine of growth which allowed it to expand overseas, but analysts are concerned about the implications of a slowdown in its home market.</p> <p>Before the January update they had been expecting Tesco's profits to rise 10% this year, but now the performance is forecast to remain flat.</p> <p>The company's \u00a3500m \"Big Price Drop\" at the end of last year was dubbed the \"Big Price Flop\" by the City, but this has not prevented the company from sticking with the scheme. A fourth wave of discounting has recently begun under the \"New Price Drop\" slogan.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK will avoid a double-dip recession but economic growth in 2012 will be slower than last year, a leading business group has forecast as it urges the chancellor to come up with new ways to boost the recovery in the budget. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has cut its growth forecast for 2012 to just 0.6%. It had been expecting growth to match 2011's 0.8% rate but is warning that cutting debt levels that are \"still too high\" will depress demand and \"result in a relatively long period of low growth\". It also warns that growth will probably weaken over the second quarter because of the additional bank holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee while the London Olympics in the third quarter may also distort growth figures. Against that backdrop it sees unemployment rising further this year. The organisation continues to expect growth to pick up to 1.8% in 2013, driven largely by net exports and business investment. But overall it warns that the UK faces a long haul out of the downturn with GDP and consumer spending returning to pre-recession levels in the second half of 2014. The BCC, which represents 100,000 businesses, is calling on George Osborne to put as much emphasis on growth as on deficit reduction. It argues that focusing on austerity alone could prove counter-productive. \"There is a danger that anaemic growth could lead to missing the net debt target and result in government debt rising,\" the BCC says in its latest economic outlook. Its director general, John Longworth added: \"The UK economy faces serious challenges, with problems in the eurozone creating difficulties for exporters, combined with dampened domestic demand.. The BCC is calling on the Treasury to scrap a \"swingeing\" 5.6% business rates rise expected in April, bring in a credit easing programme as promised and to give more help to small and medium-sized businesses trading internationally. The BCC's assertion that Britain would avoid recession \u2013 technically two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 follows a recent run of upbeat economic indicators. A separate report out on Monday echoes that view, indicating business confidence rose for a second consecutive month in February. All regions and sectors were positive about the economic outlook, according to the Lloyds Bank Wholesale Banking and Markets business barometer. But Trevor Williams, chief economist at Lloyds Bank Wholesale Banking and Markets, warned the confidence measure remained below its long-run average and that confidence was likely to remain fragile. \"With the economy likely to 'bounce along the bottom' for the foreseeable future we should not be surprised if businesses' confidence falls back over the coming months,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The UK's plans to spend more than \u00a325bn on a new nuclear deterrent are \"nonsensical\" and should be scrapped because there is no foreseeable threat to the country, says a study published on Monday. The paper, from CentreForum, an independent liberal thinktank, says the government is sleepwalking into taking a costly and illogical decision when the army, navy and air force are being squeezed by budget cuts. It urges the immediate retirement of Trident with all the saved money being reinvested to upgrade the military's conventional weapons. The 60-page study, Dropping the Bomb: A Post-Trident Future, is believed to reflect the views of many senior Lib Dems who are trying to force a debate on whether the UK still needs an independent nuclear deterrent. The armed forces minister, Nick Harvey, is overseeing a review of alternatives to Trident. Due to report later this year, it is likely to challenge many of the assumptions that have made the Tories and Labour commit themselves to replacing the weapons system. A final decision on whether to replace Trident will take place in 2016. CentreForum says the rationale that led the UK to seek an independent nuclear deterrent during the cold war no longer applies. Instead, it should move to \"a nuclear threshold posture\" \u2013 retaining some fissile material and engineering capability just in case there was ever \"a substantial deterioration in the international climate\" that led Britain to need a bomb within 12 months. The report makes clear this fallback position is unlikely to be needed. It says: \"There is no credible nuclear threat to the UK or her allies that will be deterred by a British nuclear weapons programme that is not already deterred by the United States' nuclear forces today or for the foreseeable future.\" The paper's author, Toby Fenwick, says the UK only insisted on developing its own nuclear deterrent in the 1950s and 1960s because of \"the unenunciated fear\" that the US would not protect its allies in Europe, or that the Soviet leadership believed this was the case. But the US has emphasised in \"nuclear security guarantees\" that it would respond if any Nato country were attacked. The report says: \"As President [Obama] made clear, all Nato members have an explicit American nuclear security guarantee under Article V of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty, noting, 'An attack on one is an attack on all. That is a promise for our time, and for all time'.\" Though the paper accepts, for the sake of argument, that there are theoretical threats posed by Iran, Pakistan and North Korea, it says the UK is still protected under the US security umbrella. Retaining Trident would only provide an \"incremental deterrent effect over and above that provided by the United States' nuclear arsenal\". CentreForum also dismisses those who claim the UK would lose its seat on the UN security council without a nuclear deterrent. \"Britain cannot lose its permanent seat without agreeing to do so \u2026 Linking possession of nuclear weapons as a sine qua non of holding security council permanent membership is both historically inaccurate and deeply unhelpful in the fight against nuclear proliferation \u2026 notions of national status have governed UK nuclear weapons policy. This is strategically myopic.\" The paper also balks at the cost of replacing Trident, which is likely to put added stress on a defence budget that has been slashed in the past 18 months. The government's plans to revitalise the military with new aircraft carriers and a range of other equipment \u2013 known as Future Force 2020 \u2013 are being put in peril, the paper insists. \"To spend a major part of the defence budget to protect against the distant possibility that a potential threat might arise on the outer edges of the UK's strategic interests, however, seems irrational, especially at the expense of conventional real-world capabilities.\" It adds: \"Spending more than \u00a325bn in capital costs alone to replace Trident when it has no additional deterrent role to play in current or likely future UK security scenarios is inexplicable. Consequently, the UK should withdraw Trident from service immediately, and plough the savings into the UK's conventional forces to make the Future Force 2020 vision reality.\" At the moment, Future Force 2020 is falling between two stools. \"It was scaled back so that it is theoretically deliverable (making it too small to be operationally useful) but it remains unaffordable (making it unachievable).\" An MoD spokesman said: \"The government is committed to maintaining a continuous submarine-based nuclear deterrent. Following a Trident value for money study, carried out as part of the strategic defence and security review, we are proceeding with the renewal of Trident. \"As part of the coalition agreement the Liberal Democrats will continue to explore the possibility of an alternative approach to delivering a credible nuclear deterrent. This work is led by the Cabinet Office and will report to the prime minister and deputy prime minister later this year.\"",

      "bodyText": "The last time a proposition was put to the country with such a slippery argument, the Liberal Democrats made a defiant stand, and said \"not in our name\". The health and social care bill is not the Iraq war, but the claimed rationale has changed almost as often. At first the big idea was \"promoting competition\", which was soon softened into \"real choice\", before giving way to some fuzzier notion of devolving power to professionals \u2013 who, by the way, mostly bitterly oppose the whole thing. The Lib Dems have undoubtedly extracted a few worthwhile concessions on the detail during the bill's turbulent voyage through parliament. But as the final crunch votes loom in the Lords, there is still utter confusion as to the central purpose. The Conservative health secretary, Andrew Lansley, continues to claim that his bill will enable competitive forces to reign as they do in \"any other sector\", likening the future NHS to the innovative consumer goods markets which gave rise to the MP3 player. The deputy prime minister, in contrast, has just written to all his own parliamentarians to insist that the bill's real agenda is instead preventing private providers from cleaning up at the expense of public hospitals. Ahead of Tuesday's deliberations on the all-important competition chapter, anxious crossbench and Lib Dem peers must decide whose interpretation to trust \u2013 the man who penned the original plans, or the man who initially signed off on these without having read them. Nick Clegg's credibility here is not helped by what happened during the bill's unprecedented pause. No 10 set up the Field review to get itself out of the fix, and when it duly served up fudge Mr Clegg hailed a decisive victory against privatisation. But it was no such thing, and such anxieties persisted in the Lords that the government was forced to bring in dozens of last-minute amendments, some dealing with the foundational role of the secretary of state in the system. Many more changes would be required, however, to turn this legislation into something that any peer committed to the NHS ought to countenance voting for. Mr Clegg himself suggested five fresh tweaks to persuade the sceptical Shirley Williams to co-sign his pro-bill letter. Some are useful \u2013 such as ditching the provision that would drag the marketopian competition commission into play. Others are undeliverable \u2013 the prospect of the NHS being ensnared in European competition law is threatened by a complex mix of statute and case law; it cannot be prevented by shoving in a standalone clause proclaiming that this will not come to pass. Others again simply miss the point, such as the promised \"safeguards\" against abuse of the private patient income cap, when that cap is being raised sixteen-fold, from an average of around 3% of hospital revenue up to 49%. All told, it is plain that these amendments do not add up to a thoroughgoing safeguard against privatisation. That can be seen by delving into the detail of the bill: it continues to place an unbalanced duty on the regulator to stamp out anti-competitive practices, but not practices which undercut co-operation; and it has been slyly revised to shift the gung-ho order to marketise away from that regulator (where it was so controversial) and shunted on to commissioners instead. But the same verdict is reached if you take a step back and survey the bigger picture. Just as corporate scandals engulf workfare, some excellent reporting by the Mail on Sunday has revealed McKinsey's extraordinary schmoozing of health service bigwigs. Doctors, meanwhile, scratch their heads anxiously when they spot high-paid business consultants stepping into modestly renumerated hospital management roles. One need not be a conspiracy theorist to suspect ulterior motives here. Fears of corporate takeover chided the traditionally apolitical Royal College of Physicians to lurch towards opposition last week. The envisaged future of the NHS may be replete with thrilling opportunities for business services sector, but that is precisely why parliamentarians \u2013 and patients \u2013 ought to be worried.",
