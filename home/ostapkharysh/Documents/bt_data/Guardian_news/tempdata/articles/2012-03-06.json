      "bodyText": "The latest collection by Alexander McQueen was Sarah Burton's fourth catwalk collection since inheriting the designer's chair, and her best yet. Seductive and feminine, it drew on organic and naturalistic imagery: dandelion heads were delicately embroidered onto evening dresses, while layers of fuschia tulle were layered to create gowns as dense and gaudy as bauble-decked Christmas trees. \"I wanted it to be very positive,\" said Burton after the show. \"It is about a beautiful future.\" Perfectionism and a need to push boundaries are part of the McQueen DNA; often that leads to a fetishised, deliberately challenging beauty. But organic forms can make for fabulous McQueen imagery. The softness of marabou and organza, trimmed topiary-like into shapes inspired by the domed caps and rippling underbellies of mushrooms, recalled the razor clam shell dress designed by Lee McQueen and worn by Erin O'Connor in his show of September 2000. Grace Coddington described Burton's collection as \"enchanting\"; Salma Hayek, who as the wife of PPR CEO Francois Henri Pinault is the unofficial First Lady of Parisian fashion, said it was \"joyous, like seeing beautiful flowers you have never seen before.\" But the starriest front row of the day belonged to neither Chanel nor McQueen. Kanye West, undeterred by mixed reviews of last season's catwalk debut, showcased his second collection in front of an audience which included P Diddy and Kim Kardashian as well as Anna Wintour. Kanye West not only loves fashion, but has an impressive instinct for the catwalk zeitgeist. This show included almost every major trend from next autumn's collections: black leather, velvet, high necklines, crocodile effect, and influences from sportswear, gothic and baroque aesthetics. It did not however make a strong case for West's possession of an original point of view on the season's trends. No one doubts that Kanye West genuinely loves fashion, but for the moment the passion remains unrequited.",

He stood throughout the tie in the technical area and enjoyed a yell when Birmingham let go an agricultural tackle. He strode out after the interval with a cool stare, kept the expression when Juan Mata opened the scoring, before allowing himself a celebration when Raul Meireles doubled Chelsea's lead. 2 Team selection Was this XI the first entry in the Di Matteo suicide note after the Italian left Frank Lampard on the bench and followed the decision to drop the man who fell out with AVB for the same treatment by blithely stating this was to \"freshen up\" the side? To suggest Di Matteo may already have caused disquiet from a key player would be outlandish hyperbole regarding any other manager taking charge of his first game at any other club. But this is the kingdom of Roman Abramovich and his trigger-happy fingers. 3 Players' attitude Some showy ear-flicking between the old Chelsea power axis of Lampard, John Terry and Didier Drogba in the warm-up brimmed smiles and bonhomie. Either they were smug at a successful coup in getting AVB removed, their morale boosted by the erasure of what they view as the sole cause of the club's plight, or the slack attitude that has allowed Chelsea to slump so badly was again threatening to imbue the team's play. Two quick goals after the interval offered one answer although Lampard, Terry and Drogba were still on the bench. 4 Fans' reaction Around 17 minutes had gone when the first few verses of \"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\" were offered, though the travelling support were becalmed as they watched on through a plodding opening half from their team. The Mata strike got them roused again and when Meireles burst the net for his goal with a 20-yard bullet the Blues fans exploded in unison with a bench that jumped to its feet to hail the second. This all followed the unfurling of a banner that was a message to Rafael Ben\u00edtez that informed him he is not wanted at Stamford Bridge. 5 Right to sack AVB? It is too early to tell of course but in the spirit of the club that react in 140 characters here's an answer: yes and no. A 2-0 win claimed despite a missed Mata penalty (and Daniel Sturridge unable to finish from three yards) puts Chelsea in the next round in a competition that offers a real chance of silverware. The no part of the answer? Getting rid of AVB to replace him with his No2 whose managerial experience at a club of this ilk is nil is one crazy HR decision.",

      "bodyText": "Chelsea's hopes of securing Pep Guardiola as Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's replacement appear even slimmer after it emerged the Barcelona manager may opt to take a year-long sabbatical if he leaves Camp Nou at the end of this season. Guardiola's glittering spell in charge at the Catalan club has made him Roman Abramovich's favoured candidate to succeed the Portuguese, who was dismissed on Sunday eight months into a three-year contract. Although Chelsea's pursuit of the 41-year-old had always appeared somewhat optimistic, advisers to the oligarch had suggested that, alongside Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the Bar\u00e7a coach should be considered a realistic target. Their conviction had been fuelled by the uncertainty in Spain over whether Guardiola will accept a contract extension to remain at the European champions, with his deal set to expire at the end of the season. The Barcelona coach \u2013 who has won 13 of the 16 trophies he has contested since taking over at his home club in 2008, including the European Cup twice \u2013 has tended to sign one-year contract extensions early in the new year and although he is happy at Camp Nou, he has spoken more recently of his fears of burnout. Guardiola and his assistant, Tito Vilanova, met the Bar\u00e7a president, Sandro Rosell, last week but did not reach an agreement over an extension \u2013 the club would like him to sign a two-year deal this time round \u2013 with reports in Spain suggesting he will seek a break from the game if he decides to leave in the summer. The Barcelona coach laughed off questions on the vacant Chelsea position on Tuesday. Asked if he had spoken to the club about the position he joked \"every day, every day\", though there was some sympathy for Villas-Boas. The Portuguese had dedicated last season's Europa League success with Porto to Guardiola, whom he had sought out for advice earlier in his fledgling coaching career and greatly admires, and the late Sir Bobby Robson. \"I think he is a fantastic coach but we all know that in this business everything depends on results and not on our own capacity as a coach,\" said Guardiola. \"Time is not something you get, but when you do this job you know that. I can't comment any more because I don't know the situation at Chelsea, but the results never came.\" Other potential candidates distanced themselves from the position, with Harry Redknapp \u2013 a leading contender for the vacant England manager's role ahead of the summer's European Championship \u2013 claiming that although Chelsea should be considered \"a dream job\", he is not interested. \"It would be difficult,\" said the Tottenham Hotspur manager. \"I wouldn't be able to come back to north London. So no, I will pass on that one.\" The highly rated Swansea City manager Brendan Rodgers, a former reserve-team coach at Stamford Bridge, offered a starker assessment of what awaits Villas-Boas's successor by claiming he is looking to build a career and \"not destroy it\". He added: \"The transition that is needed at the club is very much evident and it's a job that requires sensitivity about where the club is at. It's about understanding and respecting what the players have done there and also having that ruthless streak to manage the club. If any of our fans are wondering about me and Chelsea, they need not panic. I am trying to build my career and not destroy it.\" The Germany coach, Joachim L\u00f6w, was more coy when questioned about the vacancy but is unlikely to seek a move away from the national federation. \"I have a contract as national team coach until 2014,\" he said. \"The European Championships start in three months' time and everyone knows my goal. I see no reason for me to comment on media speculation.\" Rafael Ben\u00edtez, the former Liverpool manager, expressed a desire to be considered by Abramovich this week as he seeks a return to management 14 months after being sacked at Internazionale. The Spaniard had been sounded out over the possibility of taking over until the end of the season at Stamford Bridge but indicated he would consider only a longer-term arrangement until the summer of 2013. Chelsea's supporters, who had endured a torrid relationship with Ben\u00edtez's Liverpool, made their feelings clear before kick-off at Tuesday night's FA Cup fifth-round replay against Birmingham City by chanting against the Spaniard's candidacy and bellowing Mourinho's name.Copy ends",

Asked if he had spoken to the club about the position he joked \"every day, every day\", though there was some sympathy for Villas-Boas.</p> <p>The Portuguese had dedicated last season's Europa League success with Porto to Guardiola, whom he had sought out for advice earlier in his fledgling coaching career and greatly admires, and the late Sir Bobby Robson. \"I think he is a fantastic coach but we all know that in this business everything depends on results and not on our own capacity as a coach,\" said Guardiola. \"Time is not something you get, but when you do this job you know that. I can't comment any more because I don't know the situation at Chelsea, but the results never came.\"</p> <p>Other potential candidates distanced themselves from the position, with Harry Redknapp \u2013 a leading contender for the vacant England manager's role ahead of the summer's European Championship \u2013 claiming that although Chelsea should be considered \"a dream job\", he is not interested.</p> <p>\"It would be difficult,\" said the Tottenham Hotspur manager. \"I wouldn't be able to come back to north London. So no, I will pass on that one.\"</p> <p>The highly rated Swansea City manager Brendan Rodgers, a former reserve-team coach at Stamford Bridge, offered a starker assessment of what awaits Villas-Boas's successor by claiming he is looking to build a career and \"not destroy it\".</p> <p>He added: \"The transition that is needed at the club is very much evident and it's a job that requires sensitivity about where the club is at. It's about understanding and respecting what the players have done there and also having that ruthless streak to manage the club. If any of our fans are wondering about me and Chelsea, they need not panic. I am trying to build my career and not destroy it.\"</p> <p>The Germany coach, Joachim L\u00f6w, was more coy when questioned about the vacancy but is unlikely to seek a move away from the national federation. \"I have a contract as national team coach until 2014,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The European Championships start in three months' time and everyone knows my goal. I see no reason for me to comment on media speculation.\"</p> <p>Rafael Ben\u00edtez, the former Liverpool manager, expressed a desire to be considered by Abramovich this week as he seeks a return to management 14 months after being sacked at Internazionale. The Spaniard had been sounded out over the possibility of taking over until the end of the season at Stamford Bridge but indicated he would consider only a longer-term arrangement until the summer of 2013.</p> <p>Chelsea's supporters, who had endured a torrid relationship with Ben\u00edtez's Liverpool, made their feelings clear before kick-off at Tuesday night's FA Cup fifth-round replay against Birmingham City by chanting against the Spaniard's candidacy and bellowing Mourinho's name.Copy ends</p>",

I spent most of the first half uncharitably wondering whether the documentary was less about a disabled driver striving to compete on equal terms than about the power and influence bestowed by a rich and successful elder brother. It looked very much as if Nic's struggles to finish anywhere near the top half of every race owed as much to his total lack of experience as to his disability: unlike the other drivers who had been racing for years, Nic had never been near the hot seat until he was parachuted into the TCR Racing Team. But at about the half-hour mark I thought, what the hell? Nic is a lovely bloke, much of whose childhood was spent following Lewis's dream, and if he fancies getting behind the steering wheel of a super-fast car himself and his family can afford it, why shouldn't he? After that, the film glowed with good will. It also turned out I wasn't the only one who has a heart.

Three years ago United claimed the championship ahead of Rafael Ben\u00edtez's side by only four points. City lead United by two points with the rivals meeting on 30 April in what is shaping to be the Premier League title decider. Asked if pipping City could be mentally significant, Evans said: \"I think Manchester United have done that to a lot of teams over the years. A couple of years ago [three] Liverpool were pushing for the title, probably the closest they have come to it in a long while, and we managed to win the league. People always talk about that for the Rafa Ben\u00edtez situation [he left at the end of the following season] and it's kind of gone down in history for that. I just think, beating City, it's more about the Manchester thing than anything else.\" Evans believes the meeting with City next month will be the biggest ever derby. \"I think so, definitely,\" he said. \"But it all depends on the next few results from both teams. It's going to be a massive atmosphere, and whoever comes out on top in that game will fancy themselves to go on and win the title. It will be a deciding point, but I definitely think there's going to be points dropped by both teams along the way. But, obviously, whoever gets the upper hand in that game will have a great chance of winning it.\" United lost 6-1 in the reverse fixture in October and Evans said: \"I don't think it was just a case of losing that game, it was how we lost it that was really hard to take. Teams lose games. We've lost games at home to City in the past, and obviously this season they've gone on to be our main title contenders. But I think just because this is the first time in a long while the two teams from Manchester have been going for the title, it would be great to come out on top. \"I think it will always be a blot on the history of this club because of the manner of it. But there's more to it for us, in terms of beating Man City to win the league, rather than getting beat 6-1 by them in a game.\" Despite the defeat Evans can see the funny side of it. \"I don't go out that much now.

      "bodyText": "In the newly released full-length trailer for Men in Black III, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones sit at a bar reprising the roles of Agent J and Agent K respectively, the intergalactic counter-terrorists they first played in 1997. \"I am getting too old for this,\" says J. \"I can only imagine how you feel.\" Yet the issue for Smith is not that he's gotten too old for this \u2013 at 43, he looks like he's been trapped in amber since the Parents Just Don't Understand video \u2013 but that, just maybe, he's gotten too good for this. It's almost hard to remember at this point, but the former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is a two-time Academy Award nominee, once for Ali in 2001, then again for The Pursuit of Happyness in 2006. The reason this fact is so easy to lose sight of is that Smith has spent most of his time padding his resume with brainless blockbusters like I, Robot and Hancock, roles that seem to only require of him that he be able to memorize lines and behave like Will Smith. That's not entirely his fault. Like most actors who come from other disciplines, Smith was offered lots of roles that enable him to advance the Will Smith brand without expanding it. The Fresh Prince is a prime example; NBC approached Smith about starring in the sitcom, which was built around his goofy, affable, edgy-yet-family-friendly persona. Smith could have made his entire career out of cracking wise in run-and-gun summer action flicks, but in 1995 he took on the role of Paul, a gay con artist in Six Degrees of Separation. He didn't garner any nominations for his elegant, restrained performance, but he did win critical acclaim, and by choosing such an off-brand role, Smith made clear that his goal was to be an actor's actor, not coast by playing endless iterations of himself. Then the strategy changed. After Independence Day and the original Men in Black, a pair of massively successful blockbusters that bowed exactly one year apart and grossed over a billion dollars combined, Smith put his focus on movies with big budgets and big paychecks. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, or with Smith deciding he wants to be the world's biggest movie star rather than an actor with a string of well-regarded but soon-forgotten prestige films to his credit. But between Six Degrees and both of his Oscar-nominated performances, Smith has demonstrated an incredible capacity for and dedication to the craft of acting. To prepare for his turn as Muhammad Ali, Smith endured six-hour workouts for five days a week to prepare his physique, and spent hours watching footage of Ali in order to replicate the boxer's unique accent and speech patterns. Compared to that, donning a black suit and battling green-screen aliens is practically a vacation. It's understandable why Smith with do a film like Men in Black III: it's a high-profile, relatively low-commitment gig for which he'll take home a rumored $20m. That kind of dream job would be hard for anyone to turn down. But it's a shame that an actor and performer as prodigious as Smith wouldn't have greater ambition as an actor, rather than as a movie star. It isn't just MIB3. Smith's upcoming projects include After Earth, a sci-fi thriller set for release next summer, co-starring his son Jaden and directed by the increasingly disreputable M Night Shyamalan. On the sequels front, there's a third installment of the buddy-cop Bad Boys franchise in pre-production, and follow-ups to Hancock, Independence Day and I, Robot have been lurching through the development process, not to mention a second I Am Legend film \u2013 which would be a prequel, as Smith's character died at the end of the original film. It's a professional agenda that seems likely to earn a lot of people a lot of money, especially Smith. What it doesn't seem likely to do is garner Smith any further prestige nominations, or force him to stretch beyond his thespian comfort zone. It's a real shame, considering Smith has the talent to rank among his generation's finest actors, not just its most bankable stars. But perhaps MIB3 is just the remedy for Smith's slide into professional complacency. In spite of the buzz surrounding the franchise's return, the film is hardly money in the bank. The second Men in Black, which came out five years after the original, earned 30% less worldwide than the original, and that's at a point when the franchise was still considered fresh. A decade later, when both summer blockbusters and movies about aliens look so much different than they did then (back when Smith could still credibly rap over the closing credits) it's not a sure bet that Men in Black will translate for a younger audience. Here's hoping it doesn't, if only so that Smith, who is working far below his potential, will be inspired to stop looking backwards and start challenging himself.",

The reason this fact is so easy to lose sight of is that Smith has spent most of his time padding his resume with brainless blockbusters like I, Robot and Hancock, roles that seem to only require of him that he be able to memorize lines and behave like Will Smith. </p> <p>That's not entirely his fault. Like most actors who come from other disciplines, Smith was offered lots of roles that enable him to advance the Will Smith brand without expanding it. The Fresh Prince is a prime example; NBC approached Smith about starring in the sitcom, which was built around his goofy, affable, edgy-yet-family-friendly persona. Smith could have made his entire career out of cracking wise in run-and-gun summer action flicks, but in 1995 he took on the role of Paul, a gay con artist in Six Degrees of Separation. He didn't garner any nominations for his elegant, restrained performance, but he did win critical acclaim, and by choosing such an off-brand role, Smith made clear that his goal was to be an actor's actor, not coast by playing endless iterations of himself. </p> <p>Then the strategy changed. After Independence Day and the original Men in Black, a pair of massively successful blockbusters that bowed exactly one year apart and grossed over a billion dollars combined, Smith put his focus on movies with big budgets and big paychecks. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, or with Smith deciding he wants to be the world's biggest movie star rather than an actor with a string of well-regarded but soon-forgotten prestige films to his credit. But between Six Degrees and both of his Oscar-nominated performances, Smith has demonstrated an incredible capacity for and dedication to the craft of acting. To prepare for his turn as Muhammad Ali, Smith endured six-hour workouts for five days a week to prepare his physique, and spent hours watching footage of Ali in order to replicate the boxer's unique accent and speech patterns. Compared to that, donning a black suit and battling green-screen aliens is practically a vacation.</p> <p>It's understandable why Smith with do a film like Men in Black III: it's a high-profile, relatively low-commitment gig for which he'll take home a rumored $20m. That kind of dream job would be hard for anyone to turn down. But it's a shame that an actor and performer as prodigious as Smith wouldn't have greater ambition as an actor, rather than as a movie star. It isn't just MIB3. Smith's upcoming projects include After Earth, a sci-fi thriller set for release next summer, co-starring his son Jaden and directed by the increasingly disreputable M Night Shyamalan. On the sequels front, there's a third installment of the buddy-cop Bad Boys franchise in pre-production, and follow-ups to Hancock, Independence Day and I, Robot have been lurching through the development process, not to mention a second I Am Legend film \u2013 which would be a prequel, as Smith's character died at the end of the original film. </p> <p>It's a professional agenda that seems likely to earn a lot of people a lot of money, especially Smith. What it doesn't seem likely to do is garner Smith any further prestige nominations, or force him to stretch beyond his thespian comfort zone. It's a real shame, considering Smith has the talent to rank among his generation's finest actors, not just its most bankable stars. But perhaps MIB3 is just the remedy for Smith's slide into professional complacency. In spite of the buzz surrounding the franchise's return, the film is hardly money in the bank. The second Men in Black, which came out five years after the original, earned 30% less worldwide than the original, and that's at a point when the franchise was still considered fresh. A decade later, when both summer blockbusters and movies about aliens look so much different than they did then (back when Smith could still credibly rap over the closing credits) it's not a sure bet that Men in Black will translate for a younger audience. Here's hoping it doesn't, if only so that Smith, who is working far below his potential, will be inspired to stop looking backwards and start challenging himself.</p>",

A sensible way to proceed, says Ken, because the company in turn pays the salaries of others. No it isn't, says the Boris camp. He's playing fast and loose with tax. Boris doesn't approve of that. \"I want a crackdown on tax dodgers and tax avoiders of all kinds,\" he told Andrew Marr at the weekend. But if the objection is a moral one he must be looking askance at his senior adviser and ex-campaign chief, Dan Ritterband. For what we know, thanks to sharp work by blogger Adam Bienkov, is that Ritterband was hired as part of the mayor's transition team in 2008, and then his fees were paid as \"consultancy fees\" to DJR PR Ltd, registered in a residential street in Nottingham with Ritterband as sole director. Not illegal, of course, but then neither was Ken's arrangement. City Hall says everything was above board. \"DJR PR has not conducted any business since June 2008. All applicable taxes have been paid on fees paid to the company.\" But there is that thing about people who live in glass houses. And City Hall, all spherical and shiny on the Thames \u2026 that's a pretty big glass house. \u2022 Interesting, meanwhile, to hear claims concerning attempts by Boris's policing honcho Kit Malthouse to wind down Scotland Yard's phone-hacking inquiry. Interesting also to note how the allegations, from the former commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, were reported in the Sun. \"'Hysteria' on phone hacking,\" was the headline, quoting Malthouse. And the accompanying text? \"The multi-million pound probe into phone hacking has been driven by hysteria, the Leveson inquiry heard yesterday.\" They say at Wapping that they have grasped the public revulsion over hacking and the dark arts. Have they? \u2022 And there's continuing reflection about the 2011 riots. Andrew Motion is still struck by the horror of it. There stood Waterstones in Clapham Junction, the only store untroubled by looters. \"I felt it was a horrible manifestation of lack of educational opportunity,\" he tells the Camden New Journal. \"They didn't care about books. Books were so unimportant. They were left untouched while everything else was taken.\" Terrible! What would you get for a black market sonnet anyway? \u2022 Ahead of international women's day on Thursday, a cry of pain from fallen football pundit Andy Gray. You'll recall that, having disparaged a female line official and made lewd comments to a female co-worker, he was sent packing from Sky Sports. So unfair, he tells Mihir Bose in the London Evening Standard. \"I do not see myself as sexist. Not in a million years. I have four daughters and I was brought up by a wonderful mother on her own. She's 91 and is distraught about what happened.\" The rector of the church where he was married for the fourth time was also female. \"There you are,\" he says. Unarguable. M'lud, the defence rests. \u2022 Finally, howls of outrage from Damian McBride, erstwhile spin doctor for clunking fist Gordon. Why were you out dining with your mates when colleagues at the Catholic aid agency Cafod were fasting to raise funds, was our question yesterday. McBride, ever the master of rapid rebuttal, responds. \"My own Cafod fundraising fast is to give up booze for the 40-day duration of Lent, including St Patrick's day,\" he says. This is why, on the night in question, he alone drank non-alcoholic beverages. \"I'm putting \u00a320 per day aside that might otherwise have been spent on booze, so by Easter Sunday I'll have raised \u00a3800; and because Cafod is receiving Department for International Development match-funding this Lent, that will be \u00a31,600 to go to our water projects in the Horn and east of Africa.\" What's more, \"anyone who sees me take a drink during Lent can claim \u00a31,000 from me for a charity of their choice.\" Yes, he \"succumbed to a particularly delicious lasagne on Friday's fast day\", but even we can't question his commitment.

      "bodyText": "Rangers' players are on the verge of agreeing a tiered pay cut deal to avoid what earlier seemed an inevitable prospect of a raft of enforced redundancies at the club. Administrators from Duff and Phelps, who are in charge of affairs at Ibrox, need to eliminate \u00a34.5m from the Rangers budget between now and the summer. To aid that process, Rangers' top earners are close to accepting a 75% pay cut, with those lower down the wage scale taking on 50% and 25% drops until the end of May. For the highest paid players, Steven Davis and Allan McGregor, thought to earn \u00a328,000 and \u00a326,000 a week respectively, salaries will be slashed to less than \u00a310,000. The wages of the Rangers management team will be included in the scaled cuts. In exchange for absorbing vastly reduced terms, it is understood some players have sought to have clauses inserted in their contracts which offer a free transfer or one at a reasonable fee when the campaign ends. Kyle Bartley, the defender on loan at Rangers from Arsenal, said: \"All the players who will be taking wage cuts or leaving will be saving people's jobs. I don't think anyone who is still at the club wants to leave but it is a situation where some may have to leave to benefit the club. My parent club is Arsenal. It was said I'd go back if there were cuts but nothing has been decided yet. I am still a Rangers player for this season as it stands. It is a shame that such a big club has come to such a crisis. It is a very sad time for Rangers.\" A frantic Tuesday at Rangers' Murray Park training complex saw a wage deferral plan put forward by players \u2013 which had been described as \"final\" by Duff and Phelps on Monday evening \u2013 rejected by the administrators. At that stage, squad members faced the straightforward option of accepting significant pay cuts or being sacked. Thereafter, players departed and reappeared to the training ground, as did agents, as yet another round of deliberations surprisingly got under way. At 7.30pm, the Rangers captain Davis once again arrived at Murray Park with administrators thought to be ready to put their formalised wage cut proposal forward then. Two players, Gregg Wylde and Mervan Celik, were released from their contracts without any form of compensation at their own request but that matter will save Rangers only around \u00a350,000 a month in wages. Celik had moved to Rangers during the January transfer window. Wylde said: \"I volunteered to walk with no redundancy package today to help the other people in the club who have families, like the kitchen staff. I don't know what is going to happen next but I thought it was important to play my part in saving Rangers.\" Wylde, who says he has no future employer already lined up, told Scottish TV: \"I was so tired I couldn't really sleep at night. It was getting to me so I thought I would leave.\"",

      "bodyText": "He provided the glimmer of hope in an otherwise torturous pre-season for David Moyes and last week attracted the kind of praise the Everton manager has long predicted. \"Ross Barkley had a good game,\" said Trevor Brooking, the FA's director of football development, following the England Under-19s' defeat of the Czech Republic. \"I think he will be an outstanding talent for England in the future.\" It is the present, however, that has Evertonians vexed. Barkley, a homegrown 18-year-old midfielder of immense talent and stature, featured in five of Everton's first six games of the season having overcome a horrific triple leg fracture suffered in October 2010. The teenager was Everton's man of the match on his debut, the only positive from a home defeat by Queens Park Rangers, and rapidly making up for lost time in a struggling team. And then he vanished from the first-team picture. Only three substitute appearances have followed since September and requests for an explanation have proven tiresome for Moyes. The interest reflects Barkley's potential and the clamour that surrounds any emerging English talent, while Moyes's reticence on the subject reflected concern that an inexperienced teenager was being portrayed as Everton's saviour. Now, with signs of an improvement in form \u2013 Barkley was involved in both goals in the Under-19s' 2-1 win \u2013 his manager admits the absence has been a deliberate and necessary plan. \"My intention is to reintroduce Ross back into the first-team squad and my idea was always to do it around April time,\" Moyes revealed. \"I've told the boy what my thoughts were. I think he needed six months of games. I hear a lot of people asking where Ross is but he's not been ready to play in the team. But there are certainly signs that he is getting better now. \"I think it was for his own good. He needed the games and we've played him in the reserves and the youth team. We've tried to get as many games into him as possible because he missed a year and a half of football prior to that. He's missed so much football and now I'm looking to reintroduce him again towards the end of the season, when I think it's a bit easier to do.\" That process continued at Goodison Park on Tuesday, when Barkley featured for the reserves against Liverpool, the \"mini-derby\" finishing 0\u20130 and also featuring Phil Jagielka on his return from a knee-ligament injury. Moyes insists the midfielder accepted the decision to take him out of the first team, but believes it shows the hype around Barkley to describe his treatment in that way. \"He is 18, so to say, 'You are taking him out', all we are doing is putting him back into the reserves and youth team,\" the Scot added. \"When he came into the first team, he was ready to play. He'd trained all summer, he'd been training for months to recover from his triple broken leg. He came with us in pre-season and played games for us, so he was ready at the start of the season to play a couple of games. \"What's happened is probably because of the long schedule of training \u2013 there was a big dip not long after. In one or two games, we needed him. But there's a longer development of Ross Barkley and it shouldn't be expected that he is there right now.\" The dip was noticeable in the win at Blackburn Rovers, where Barkley conceded a penalty in his third senior appearance for the team, and Moyes admits Everton's predicament earlier in the season was not conducive to a youngster's development. He added: \"It was going to affect the team. On the day, he nearly cost the team the result. He had to come out to understand the game a little bit more. He'll be better once he gets back and has had the games. He played very well for England Under-19s so there are good signs we have a real promising player here. But that's what we do here, we bring them along at the right speed and hopefully we end up doing the right thing.\"",

But I was funny, so I could go up on an open mic night and tell five minutes of masturbation jokes the same way a fat girl goes up and does karaoke. What was your big breakthrough? Not having to work for a living. Back when I was young, with a mullet and a piece-of-shit car, going on stage for 30 minutes and 100 bucks: that was success. You've often been accused of being controversial in your choice of material. Do you set out to shock? You say it like being controversial is a crime. Honestly, the controversy is you [the media]. People go, \"Oh, you got into trouble for some things you said.\" No \u2013 you wrote that I got into trouble; maybe one guy got mad at a joke, but that happens at every show. At my last show in Cincinnati, I had someone walk out because I made a passing, flippant reference to Syria. I was like, you've sat through [jokes about] rape and paedophilia, and that made you walk out? Do you suffer for your art? I hate doing it a lot, but even poor, suffering people in our western culture aren't really suffering. And look at people like Charles Bukowski and Hunter S Thompson: I'd rather sell shoes than live that kind of lifestyle. When it comes to properly hard living, I'm a pedestrian. What's the worst thing anyone ever said about you? The ones that bother me the most are the media saying, \"He's like the next Bill Hicks.\" It's supposed to be complimentary, but then all these Bill Hicks fans show up thinking you're going to be like him, and then go, \"You're no Bill Hicks.\" And I'm like, \"I never wanted to try to be like him, I don't think I'm anything like him at all, and now you're mad at me for not being him because a journalist didn't have a better reference.\" Which other artists do you most admire? The ones that quit. Take [comedian] Dave Chappelle and [American football player] Ricky Williams: at the top of their game, when they were having the most money thrown at them, they said, \"Keep the money. This is just not how I want to live.\" What's the most difficult heckle you ever got? You can't throw superlatives at me: it's been a long career. But over here, the problem with the heckling is that you use your own vernacular, and I don't know whether you're being nice or mean. I remember at one of the first shows I did in Edinburgh, some guy just kept screaming: \"Scull it, scull it!\" Somebody else had to spell out for me that he meant I should drink my beer. Born: Worcester, Massachusetts, 1967. Career: Has performed at festivals around the world and on TV shows such as The Man Show and Girls Gone Wild.

      "bodyText": "More than 40,000 people have responded to the Boundary Commission for England's attempt to redraw the parliamentary constituency map. Their responses, mainly critical, many of them angrily so, went online yesterday. Last time the commission conducted such a review, they received 29,000 responses. So the large increase in responses this time is very striking \u2013 and should be taken very seriously. It suggests that the current review is particularly controversial and unsatisfactory. The 2011 review does not redraw the map in the mainly marginal manner familiar from its predecessors. It takes a more radical approach, largely dictated by a coalition act of parliament last year. This cuts the number of English constituencies from 533 to 502 and requires that each constituency should have an electorate within 5% of a quota of 76,641 voters. This is not wrong in principle, but it means that all save 77 English seats will have new boundaries by the time of the planned 2015 election and that the commissioners have broken up most existing seats in order to satisfy the need for equality. Inevitably, many communities feel they have been cast to the winds. Yesterday's anguished published responses reflect that. That anguish is articulated in the north and the south, in the towns and the counties, and by all political parties. \"To place part of Bedfordshire with Hertfordshire is frankly as big an anathema to the local population as though they had been grouped with Mars,\" writes the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries. \"The people of the City of Salford have a strong civic identity and pride as Salfordians, not Mancunians,\" echoes Labour's Hazel Blears. \"Rutland Liberal Democrats are totally opposed to a merger with Corby,\" says a press cutting provided by the local Tory MP, who agrees. In Cumbria, particularly brutally treated by the commission, a local Tory MP, Rory Stewart, quotes Wordsworth in defence of the region's existing boundaries. In London, Labour's Emily Thornberry cites Wesley in support of her attempts to keep Finsbury in the name of her new seat. The Conservative MP David Davis speaks for many on all sides when he says: \"Given the decline of civic society generally, and the political parties in particular, this process is highly corrosive of effective representation.\" There is now less than a month for responses to the responses. Later in 2012 the commission will come back with amended ideas. Next year, the government is due to put the whole plan to the Commons. Getting the changes right matters, partly because they are so extensive and partly because there is a growing awareness of what they portend for the political future. This process is politics in the raw. Major alterations are needed if the package is to command the respect it currently lacks.",

      "bodyText": "The great welfare overhaul has finally wended its way through parliament, and at no point during the tortuous debates were the poor offered a choice. There was no menu of pain that allowed for any preference between housing benefit caps, cuts to disability payments and the shredding of the social fund. All of these things, it was claimed, were indispensable to repairing Britain's battered balance sheet. But this week fiscal attention has turned to the other end of the social scale, and suddenly retrenchment has gone a la carte. Even as the eurozone's slide into slump is confirmed, the pre-budget debate on stinging the rich has taken an either/or turn, and top-rate taxpayers are being invited to pour their fears about lost child benefit into ministerial ears. It was no Conservative, but Vince Cable who yesterday sparked speculation about scrapping the new 50p tax rate, which exclusively bites on incomes over \u00a3150,000. A few hours before his blunt letter about the failings of the coalition's industrial policy leaked to the BBC, Dr Cable let slip to the same broadcaster that there were backroom discussions about ditching this levy in return for new ones on wealth, particularly palatial southern homes. He can claim consistency in a narrow sense here: in opposition he spent long years proposing to tax wealth more and income less. But that was in the good times. In an era where the coalition is asking poor parents to \u2013 in the calculations of one eminent Lib Dem economist \u2013 raise children on 62p a day, decency surely requires that both top pay and outsize assets take a hit. Only a nakedly self-serving plutocrat would openly deny this; the argument of the respectable right will be that high marginal rates lead to such a distortionary depression of taxable income that no revenue is raked in. That is very doubtful, and it has certainly not been proved \u2013 the evidence will only start to emerge after meticulous crunching of tax returns filed this January. While they wait for robust analysis, ministers should concentrate on reducing the extent of any distortion, by closing loopholes which allow top incomes to be converted into something less taxable. Jumping the gun and scrapping 50p now would be an outrage. After all, child benefit shows the danger of rushing out policies without thinking them through. There is a principled case for a universal payment which recognises the cost of raising a child, but faced with an exceptionally challenging fiscal repair job, there was also a case for targeting scarce public funds away from the better-off that could not be dismissed out of hand. This, however, was an argument to be developed in a careful, not an impetuous spirit. In the event, George Osborne was warned on the very day that he first said he would snatch child benefit from higher earners that his plan would lead to the harsh punishment of stay-at-home mothers and parents on the cusp of tax brackets. These fears were brushed aside. There was, as is explained on our Society pages today, a perfectly straightforward way to sort the anomalies through the tax credits, but the chancellor showed a bone-headed reluctance to deploy these inventions of Gordon Brown. Thus it is that the coalition is now flapping about to resolve these perversities at the eleventh hour. What is most damning, however, is that while all this attention is lavished on middle-class worries, there is casual disregard for the many perversities affecting the poor. To take one example, the government this week admitted that after a tax credit is snatched from 212,000 part-time workers in April many of them will be worse off than they would be if they quit and claimed the dole. Ministers protest this is a transitional glitch which will soon be ironed out, but does anyone seriously believe they would ask families in middle England to do a year's toil for negative pay? David Cameron's language continues to promote an inclusive Conservatism, which harks back to the pre-Thatcher one nation tradition. The priorities of his government, however, are steadily revealing a narrowing concern with \"our people\", worthy of the lady herself.",

There was, as is explained on our Society pages today, a perfectly straightforward way to sort the anomalies through the tax credits, but the chancellor showed a bone-headed reluctance to deploy these inventions of Gordon Brown. Thus it is that the coalition is now flapping about to resolve these perversities at the eleventh hour.</p> <p>What is most damning, however, is that while all this attention is lavished on middle-class worries, there is casual disregard for the many perversities affecting the poor. To take one example, the government this week admitted that after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/04/working-tax-credit-changes-postponed?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">a tax credit is snatched from 212,000 part-time workers in April</a> many of them will be worse off than they would be if they quit and claimed the dole. Ministers protest this is a transitional glitch which will soon be ironed out, but does anyone seriously believe they would ask families in middle England to do a year's toil for negative pay?</p> <p>David Cameron's language continues to promote an inclusive Conservatism, which harks back to the pre-Thatcher one nation tradition. The priorities of his government, however, are steadily revealing a narrowing concern with \"our people\", worthy of the lady herself.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hannah Miley could climb the podium as the first Team GB medallist next summer in the 400m medley \u2013 among the early finals to be contested in this glittering Olympic pool. But having on Tuesday night also qualified in style for the 200m medley in the fastest time in the world this year, the Scot may increasingly believe she can target a medal in both events. As Miley secured her second spot at the Games, stretching her unbeaten run at the British Gas Swimming Championship to six years, two surprise fellow qualifiers shared the limelight. Rebecca Turner, who won gold in the 200m freestyle, and Sophie Allen, who finished behind Miley in the 200m medley, demolished personal bests to exceed expectations and demonstrate the strength in depth that British Swimming's performance director, Michael Scott, paid tribute to ahead of this competition. For Miley, for whom qualification is just the first step towards a hoped-for medal in the summer, her time of 2min 10.77sec was faster than she swam at the distance last year. It is in the 400m, in which she was a silver medallist last year at the world championships in Shanghai and for which she qualified in style on Sunday, that the 22-year-old is expected to compete most strongly. But her assured performance in the 200m will raise already burgeoning expectations. Miley was sixth after the opening butterfly lap, second after the backstroke and \u2013 following a trademark breaststroke in which she powered ahead of Allen \u2013 went on to finish first. Miley, backed by the sporting philanthropist Barrie Wells and trained by her helicopter pilot father Patrick at a 25m pool in the Aberdeenshire market town of Inverurie, paid tribute to the young talent snapping at the heels of more established members of the British team. \"I knew it was going to be a big race on my hands with so many younger girls coming through and stepping up to the medley,\" she said. Earlier Turner had expressed disbelief at finishing first in the 200m freestyle. When she was 14 years old, she was told the times she would swim five years later by her Sheffield coach Russ Barber. She said she did not believe him until Tuesday night. As the 19-year-old demolished her personal best by almost a second with a \"gold or bust\" performance in the final length, Turner said she had surprised herself. \"I only came into this trying to get a relay spot, so to get an individual and win is pretty amazing,\" she said, having overhauled Caitlin McClatchey in the final 50m. Turner said training with Miley in Scotland had helped inspire her to claim her place at the London Games: \"It was a good taste to see what a world medallist does. We all really enjoyed ourselves and got a lot out of it.\" Despite finishing second, there was disappointment for McClatchey. She failed to secure the required time, despite having done so in the semi-finals when she swam half a second quicker, and she will have to try again at the ASA Championships in Sheffield in June. In the men's 200m butterfly final, the 2010 Commonwealth Games silver medallist Michael Rock missed out in a three-way shoot-out for the two places on offer, which was settled by the width of a single stroke. Joe Roebuck and Roberto Pavoni claimed the two Olympic places by finishing first and second respectively \u2013 a reverse of their positions in the 400m individual medley, in which they both also qualified on Saturday. Roebuck's winning time of 1:55.94 was the fastest in the world this year. Just like the 20 other British swimmers who have so far claimed places, Roebuck betrayed a mixture of relief and quiet determination. \"I knew it was going to be a good race between the three of us. Qualifying [on Saturday] gave me more hunger to come back today. I am sure my coach will think I did a lot of things wrong but at the moment I'm just enjoying my win.\"",

      "bodyText": "It was one comeback too far. Arsenal's performance touched on the exquisite in the first half yet the agonising failure tasted the same. No team in Champions League history have overturned a four-goal first-leg deficit and that remains the case. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's braves, though, gave it one hell of a roll. This team have refused to bow in recent weeks. In each of their previous three Premier League matches they came from behind to win, most memorably in the derby against Tottenham Hotspur. And when they hurled off the shackles that had inhibited them in the first leg of this last-16 collision to take a three-goal half-time lead, the platform was in place for an I-was-there evening. Arsenal emerged with European pride restored and then some; together with the continuation of recent progress, which ought to set them fair for a return to this competition next season. Players covered themselves in glory, particularly Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, in an unfamiliar deep-lying central midfield role, and Tomas Rosicky, who has emerged from what has felt like a hibernation. But in the second half they ran out of steam against a Milan side who belatedly recovered their composure and showed their experience. Robin van Persie had the best chance to square things up on aggregate in the 59th minute but, at close quarters, his attempted chip was read by Christian Abbiati. Milan have been scarred from seemingly unassailable positions in the past. Think Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a 2004 and Liverpool 2005. Arsenal 2012 so nearly checked into their hall of shame. Wenger raged at the Slovenian referee Damir Skomina, who did endure erratic moments, but the manager's frustration would have been better directed at his lack of credible options in reserve. As his players tired he had little on the substitutes' bench, particularly in midfield, where injuries had bitten. Arsenal were left to lament their shocking performance in the first leg, on a pudding of a pitch at San Siro, and the plaudits here could not mask the pain. At least, though, they could have few regrets on the night. They had prepared diligently, especially on the psychological side, with Wenger in almost ludicrously bullish pre-match form. There was, he had said, a \"real possibility\" that his team could prove the impossible was possible; if Milan could score four at home, so could they. His players took their cue and mustered every last ounce of effort from the first whistle. Wenger and his side are nothing if not hopeless romantics and they fired the dreams of the home support with the early goal. Mark van Bommel had already been booked for a foul on Rosicky that means he will be suspended for the first leg of the next tie when he failed to track the outstanding Laurent Koscielny from Oxlade-Chamberlain's viciously inswinging corner. Van Bommel was not helped by his team-mate Philippe Mex\u00e8s, who lost his bearings and blocked him off. Koscielny profited from close range. The crowd was energised; ditto those in red shirts. Van Persie twice worked Abbiati before the occasion was ignited by the second goal. Again the defending was dire; battle-hardened Serie A teams are simply not supposed to concede like this. Theo Walcott's low cross from the right looked harmless but Thiago Silva's clearance was directed weakly at Rosicky, who was hovering just inside the area. The Czech measured a cool side-foot finish inside the near corner and the passion of the celebrations reflected the feeling that Milan could be taken. The visitors were prisoners in their shells. Hope turned to conviction upon the third. Oxlade-Chamberlain's burst into the area was checked illegally by the dismal Djamel Mesbah and Van Persie did what he does from the spot. The longer that he was forced to delay his kick by Van Bommel, his Holland team-mate, the more of a certainty it became that he would score his 32nd goal of a remarkable season. Wenger did not want the first half to end. The TV cameras picked out a banner with the phrase \"It's up for grabs now\", and the sense that it could be Arsenal's night hardened when Stephan El Shaarawy, the Milan prodigy with the rock star's haircut, fluffed a gilt-edged chance in the 45th minute. The fear, though, was that Arsenal could not maintain their intensity in the second half and Milan, having regrouped at the interval, emerged in more compact fashion. Then again, it would have been difficult for them to be any more inept. Zlatan Ibrahimovic came to life and Milan made inroads into Arsenal territory. It felt as though the next goal would win it and Arsenal went dramatically close. Rosicky led a break and when Gervinho's shot deflected off Mex\u00e8s, Abbiati needed to change direction smartly to save. The ball broke to Van Persie; the Emirates held its breath. Abbiati, though, thrust up a hand to paw the effort away. The move was Arsenal's only clear opportunity of the second period. As they chased glory, Wenger's team diced with death. Wojciech Szczesny's dreadful clearance gave Ibrahimovic a sighting and the striker's shot fizzed just wide. Then Antonio Nocerino somehow diverted a poke from point-blank range back at the goalkeeper, when half of the net was empty. Milan, however, dragged themselves over the line.",

      "bodyText": "In a dour contest that did neither side credit, the stark contrast between the haves and the have-nots of the Championship was no greater illustrated than here last night. Newly rich Reading sneaked past newly in administration Portsmouth, the difference in fortunes off the pitch replicated on it. Reading continue to ride the crest of a wave, securing their seventh successive victory and eagerly anticipating the \u00a325m takeover, due to be completed this month, by Anton Zingarevich, a young Russian tycoon. In third place, Reading lie one point behind West Ham United, who play Watford at Upton Park on Wednesday night. Good times in Berkshire, perhaps, but desperate times in Hampshire. A record of one win in 10 matches, plus a 10-point deduction, has left Portsmouth at the foot of the table. Relegation \u2013 if, that is, they manage to finish the campaign \u2013 would appear inevitable. The Good Ship Pompey is sinking, fast. Still, Reading roll on. The beaten play-off finalists of last season have won 15 times in 19 matches, not having drawn a game since October, and have kept six clean sheets in seven outings. Brian McDermott, their manager, has a newly signed contract in his pocket and, apparently, the only way is up. \"We have to work hard for every result in this league,\" McDermott said. \"We couldn't get involved in all Portsmouth's problems, we just had to take care of ourselves, and we did. We relish every game, we work hard every day, and I don't think my players get the credit they deserve. But we stick together as a group. \"Since Anton Zingarevich came in, maybe there is a bit more expectation from the fans. But I like that, I encourage that. We want an exciting time at the end of this season, as we had at the end of last. We'll just keep ticking off the games and see where we end up.\" As Portsmouth head towards League One oblivion, Michael Appleton, their manager, puts on a brave face \u2026 week in, week out. \"We've talked about it with the players and we're still convinced we can survive,\" he said. \"We've got 12 games left and we know how many we need to win to get us out of this mess.\" Not if predator rivals keep picking off their best players. As Portsmouth have attempted to ease their wage bill, Birmingham City have nabbed Erik Huseklepp and Cardiff City took Liam Lawrence. Others may follow. \"We've had a few polite enquiries from various clubs about various players,\" Appleton said. \"But there's been no hard offers like we had for Erik and Liam.\" Still, the Pompey fans remain a resolute bunch and were in good voice on a chilly evening, chanting throughout. Not that they had much to cheer, with Portsmouth playing second fiddle for long spells in a mundane affair. Summing up the all-round lethargy, just one effort hit the target all night \u2013 Reading's goal. Ian Harte released Jason Roberts and his precise cross was glanced in by Noel Hunt for his sixth goal of the season and third in five games.",

Newly rich Reading sneaked past newly in administration Portsmouth, the difference in fortunes off the pitch replicated on it.</p> <p>Reading continue to ride the crest of a wave, securing their seventh successive victory and eagerly anticipating the \u00a325m takeover, due to be completed this month, by Anton Zingarevich, a young Russian tycoon. In third place, Reading lie one point behind West Ham United, who play Watford at Upton Park on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Good times in Berkshire, perhaps, but desperate times in Hampshire. A record of one win in 10 matches, plus a 10-point deduction, has left Portsmouth at the foot of the table. Relegation \u2013 if, that is, they manage to finish the campaign \u2013 would appear inevitable. The Good Ship Pompey is sinking, fast.</p> <p>Still, Reading roll on. The beaten play-off finalists of last season have won 15 times in 19 matches, not having drawn a game since October, and have kept six clean sheets in seven outings. Brian McDermott, their manager, has a newly signed contract in his pocket and, apparently, the only way is up.</p> <p>\"We have to work hard for every result in this league,\" McDermott said. \"We couldn't get involved in all Portsmouth's problems, we just had to take care of ourselves, and we did. We relish every game, we work hard every day, and I don't think my players get the credit they deserve. But we stick together as a group.</p> <p>\"Since Anton Zingarevich came in, maybe there is a bit more expectation from the fans. But I like that, I encourage that. We want an exciting time at the end of this season, as we had at the end of last. We'll just keep ticking off the games and see where we end up.\"</p> <p>As Portsmouth head towards League One oblivion, Michael Appleton, their manager, puts on a brave face \u2026 week in, week out. \"We've talked about it with the players and we're still convinced we can survive,\" he said. \"We've got 12 games left and we know how many we need to win to get us out of this mess.\"</p> <p>Not if predator rivals keep picking off their best players. As Portsmouth have attempted to ease their wage bill, Birmingham City have nabbed Erik Huseklepp and Cardiff City took Liam Lawrence. Others may follow. \"We've had a few polite enquiries from various clubs about various players,\" Appleton said. \"But there's been no hard offers like we had for Erik and Liam.\"</p> <p>Still, the Pompey fans remain a resolute bunch and were in good voice on a chilly evening, chanting throughout. Not that they had much to cheer, with Portsmouth playing second fiddle for long spells in a mundane affair. Summing up the all-round lethargy, just one effort hit the target all night \u2013 Reading's goal. Ian Harte released Jason Roberts and his precise cross was glanced in by Noel Hunt for his sixth goal of the season and third in five games.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barack Obama has accused Republican presidential candidates of casually \"beating the drums of war\" over Iran without having the political courage to directly advocate a military attack or considering the human cost of battle. In his first press conference of the year on Tuesday, Obama turned on the Republican politicians who for days have been accusing him of weakness and naivet\u00e9 over Iran, ramped up by the visit of the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and a meeting of the US's most powerful pro-Israel lobby group. The president said his policy of sanctions has united much of the international community to pressure Iran and that \"we have a window of opportunity where this can still be resolved diplomatically\". \"That's my track record. Now, what's said on the campaign trail \u2013 those folks don't have a lot of responsibilities. They're not commander-in-chief. And when I see the casualness with which some of these folks talk about war, I'm reminded of the costs involved in war,\" he said. \"I'm reminded that the decision that I have to make in terms of sending our young men and women into battle, and the impacts that has on their lives, the impact it has on our national security, the impact it has on our economy. This is not a game. There's nothing casual about it.\" Obama returned to the theme later in the press conference. \"When I sign letters to families that haven't \u2013 whose loved ones have not come home, I am reminded that there is a cost. Sometimes we bear that cost. But we think it through. We don't play politics with it,\" he said. \"Typically, it's not the folks who are popping off who pay the price. It's these incredible men and women in uniform and their families who pay the price.\" The president went on to challenge his Republican opponents to say if they want a war and then address the consequences of attacking Iran. \"Now, the one thing that we have not done is we haven't launched a war. If some of these folks think that it's time to launch a war, they should say so. And they should explain to the American people exactly why they would do that and what the consequences would be. Everything else is just talk,\" he said. Obama's comments were aimed, among others, at Mitt Romney, who described the president as \"feckless\" over Iran in Tuesday's Washington Post and advocated a policy of \"peace through strength\". The press conference came hours after the announcement that the US will join Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany in a new round of negotiations with Tehran, a move that led Rick Santorum to accuse Obama of \"appeasement\". Obama defended those talks, saying they are an opportunity to judge whether Iran understands that \"the world community means business\". \"I don't expect a breakthrough in a first meeting, but I think we will have a pretty good sense fairly quickly as to how serious they are about resolving the issue,\" he said. Obama derided the aggressive posturing of some of his opponents and more hawkish supporters of Israel who have pressed for an explicit commitment to the use of force against Iran by setting \"red lines\" that Tehran's nuclear programme must not cross. \"When I see some of these folks who have a lot of bluster and a lot of big talk but when you actually ask them specifically what they would do, it turns out they repeat the things that we've been doing over the last three years. It indicates to me that that's more about politics than actually trying to solve a difficult problem,\" he said. The president had a similar reaction to calls for military action against Syria, including Senator John McCain's demand this week that the US bomb in support of the forces fighting the regime in Damascus. Obama said events in Syria were \"heartbreaking\" but that military intervention was not the answer. \"For us to take military action unilaterally, as some have suggested, or to think that somehow there is some simple solution, I think is a mistake. What happened in Libya was we mobilised the international community, had a UN security council mandate, had the full co-operation of the region, Arab states, and we knew that we could execute very effectively in a relatively short period of time. This is a much more complicated situation,\" he said. \"The notion that the way to solve every one of these problems is to deploy our military, that hasn't been true in the past and it won't be true now. We've got to think through what we do through the lens of what's going to be effective, but also what's critical for US security interests.\" The president has been accused of weakness over both Syria and Iran, but the focus of recent days has been on Tehran because of differences with Netanyahu over the value of sanctions and diplomacy. The Israeli prime minister on Monday derided the effectiveness of sanctions in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) and said that \"none of us can afford to wait much longer\" to act against Tehran. Romney told Aipac on Tuesday that Obama's policy of \"engagement\" with Tehran was naive and gave the Iranian leadership time to develop its nuclear programme. \"Hope is not a foreign policy. The only thing respected by thugs and tyrants is our resolve backed by our power and our readiness to use it,\" he said. \"As president I'll be ready to engage in diplomacy but I will be just as ready to engage our military might.\" Newt Gingrich went further in telling Aipac that as president he would give Israel the means to attack Tehran's nuclear facilities and let it do so without question. \"I will initiate a strategy in the tradition of Reagan, Thatcher and Pope John Paul II to undermine and replace the Iranian dictatorship by every possible method short of war in order to achieve a government we could trust and could deal with,\" he said. \"At the same time I would provide all available intelligence to the Israeli government, ensure that they had the equipment necessary and reassure them that if an Israeli prime minister decides he has to avoid the threat of a second Holocaust through pre-emptive measures that I would require no advance notice to understand why I would support the right of Israel to survive in a dangerous world.\" Santorum said Obama should put an ultimatum to Tehran to end its nuclear programme and \"that if they don't tear down those facilities, we will tear down them ourselves\". Obama's pushback was reinforced by the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, who told the president's critics not to mistake a willingness to pursue diplomacy for weakness. Panetta, speaking to Aipac on Tuesday, said the military option is on the table as a last resort if sanctions fail and the president's record demonstrates that he will use it if he believes there is no alternative. \"As the president made clear, the United States does not bluff. In this town it's easy to talk tough. Acting tough is a hell of a lot more important,\" he said. \"The president ordered 30,000 additional troops to battle in Afghanistan to confront a resurgent Taliban. He launched a comprehensive precision bombing campaign to protect the Libyans and ultimately toppled a brutal dictator. He has ordered US warships to pass through the straits of Hormuz despite the threats that we have received from Iran. \"And he has been the driving force behind the most successful and lethal counter-terrorism campaign in US history culminating in the bold decision to send US special operations forces hundreds of miles into Pakistan to take the risk to take down bin Laden. And he did.\"",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has promised businesses that credit easing, the government's long-awaited plan for getting cheap loans to small businesses, would be underway by the budget, as anxious financial markets suffered their worst day's trading since December. Share prices plunged on both sides of the Atlantic, amid fears that global growth is waning and persistent rumours that \"private sector involvement\" for Greece \u2013 the voluntary deal to agree a reduction in the country's debts \u2013 is in jeopardy. In London, the FTSE 100 suffered its biggest daily fall since 14 December, losing 109 points, to close at 5765. As the market mood darkened, the chancellor struck a defiant tone in a speech to manufacturers, telling the Engineering Employers' Federation dinner that he would eschew \"unfunded giveaways\" in his budget a fortnight from now. However, he promised that the national loan guarantee scheme, which he first announced in his conference speech last autumn when he called the policy \"credit easing\", would be in operation by the time he delivers his budget on 21 March. Under the \u00a320bn scheme, the Treasury will offer to guarantee borrowing by high-street banks, bringing down their costs of funding. Banks will then be obliged to ringfence these funds for low-cost loans to small businesses. John Walker, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"We are pleased that credit easing is finally on its way as it should help firms reduce the cost of borrowing.\" Continental markets also sold off sharply after Eurostat, the eurozone's statistical agency, said growth in the 17-member area declined by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2011. Spain's IBEX index was down 3.1%, the Italian FTSE MIB down 3.4%, the German Dax down 3.1% and the French CAC off 3.3%. The Dow Jones had lost 200 points by lunchtime. In Athens on Tuesday morning, Greece was forced to deny that it would delay the crucial restructuring of its debts painstakingly negotiated with banks and other bondholders. The deal is a key condition of the latest \u20ac130bn bailout. Investors have until Thursday to sign up to the agreement to accept a write-down on the value of their Greek bonds. Athens needs two-thirds of investors to participate to impose the deal on the rest of its bondholders. The fragility of Greece's situation was underlined by a new analysis by RBS economists, who suggested the country could still face a debt burden of 160% of GDP by 2020 \u2013 around the same as last year's level \u2013 even if the bailout succeeds. Jacques Cailloux of RBS added that any fresh round of bailout negotiations would be even more fraught, because a large and growing proportion of Athens's debt is in the hands of official creditors such as the ECB, which will probably have to accept some debt forgiveness. \"Rising discontent about austerity, political resistance to the loss of more sovereignty combined with likely ongoing failure to reach still too ambitious quarterly targets under bailout II are a toxic combination \u2026 Politicians and policymakers alike should be preparing themselves for [this reaction] in the runup to the negotiations surrounding the next bailout which might require official debt forgiveness to reduce its debt burden,\" he said. Investors were also alarmed by a report that first emerged earlier this week from the Institute for International Finance \u2013 the body that negotiated the bailout deal on behalf of bondholders \u2013 suggesting a disorderly default by Greece could cost as much as \u20ac1tn (\u00a3833bn). \"With the fresh uncertainties coming into play about Greece and after the effects of the Chinese slowdown, investors are taking a defensive posture,\" said Andre Bakhos, director of market analytics at Lek Securities in New York.",

      "bodyText": "David Coulthard says Lewis Hamilton's move to Monaco, the home of so many famous racing drivers, could kick-start the McLaren man's return to form in the 2012 Formula One world championship, which starts in Melbourne on 18 March. Coulthard, a McLaren driver for nine seasons until 2004, said: \"I've been there since 1995 and I would endorse being there \u2013 from a lifestyle point of view, great training and great sports community, sports stars, easy to travel and get to most places in Europe in an hour \u2026 \" Hamilton has lived a comparatively secluded life in Switzerland but has now decided to live alongside his F1 rivals Nico Rosberg and Paul Di Resta as well as many other sports and showbiz celebrities. This year he will attempt to recharge his career after a most disappointing F1 season. Coulthard added: \"McLaren appear to have given him a chunk of time off, to go away and to focus. He has to come back with all that straightened out because when he flies to Australia that's it. It's relentless until the end of the season again, except a small summer break. \"He has grown up in the public eye and he laid himself bare last year, which you think on the one hand is very brave and I take my hat off to him, but now he's got to show he has the strength and is man enough to go again. F1 needs an on-form Lewis Hamilton because he is one of the most exciting drivers to see out there on the track.\" Speaking at a BBC function to launch the corporation's coverage of F1 this season,, when it faces an onslaught from the new boys at Sky, his fellow pundit Eddie Jordan recommended Hamilton remains with McLaren when his contract expires at the end of the year. Jordan said: \"Can you tell me that Lewis would be better off in another team, given their resources and level of investment? They have had a bad car last season but are unlikely to have another one this season. It looks a good car.\"But Jordan also felt McLaren could have done more to look after Hamilton last year. \"I think that McLaren \u2013 and this is in some way a criticism against McLaren \u2013 that they will have learned from their mistakes last season. \"Lewis was almost forlorn last season. He was on his own, he didn't have someone to talk to, someone to confide in. And when you're in that car it's the loneliest job you can ever do. There's nothing worse. \"You're cocooned in there. There's no way out, you're in here for two hours. You have to make all those decisions yourself. There is some communication but it's so poor that you basically have to make all the decisions yourself. I'm a huge, huge fan of Lewis and I think he will be there or thereabout in the championship this season.\"",

I lean against the brushed steel of the elevator as it purrs along to a monotonous voice declaring, \"Lift going up.\" Somewhere on my journey between the ground floor and second floor of London's Hayward gallery, something surreal takes over. The harmless voice of the lift is hijacked by the resonant tones of a monkey describing its intimate personal life to me. Welcome to the demented cosmos of artist David Shrigley. My first glimpse of the peculiar is his work Ostrich. A stuffed bird, mounted on a podium and neatly decapitated, provides an insight into the brilliant, comic and raw absurdity of this exhibition. If Michael Jackson and Bubbles were to open a department store, this is probably what it would look like: a headless squirrel, a stuffed terrier holding an \"I'm Dead\" sign, a slice of Black Forest gateau and a vase of toenail clippings. Modern art is always the subject of debate. Is it really art? Or can anyone just casually nail a Rich Tea biscuit to a wall, charge people to view it and declare it a satirical take on the ways of the world? There's the absurd: a giant teacup the diameter of a rose bush, brimming with what looks like Earl Grey. Then there's the visual pun: a stepladder that has been stepped on and destroyed. And there are insider jokes for artists \u2013 a two-minute animation of a finger flicking a light switch, a mocking tribute to Martin Creed's The Lights Going On and Off. But every now and again there is a connection between art and reality that is more than just a joke. I see a selection of miniature framed photographs on a wall. To look at them, I'm forced to crouch down and lie on the floor, earning disapproving glances from gallery visitors. They all symbolise smallness. Images of thumbs, pinkies and other tiny implements are displayed. Then, moving into obscurity, Shrigley adds a picture of Evo Stik adhesive. He's got me looking, and that's what it's all about. There are keys on hooks, signs saying \"Look at me\", a metal gate telling me not to linger. I crawl through a tiny gateway and peer through a hole in the wall to spy on inflatable worms. It's like being Alice in Wonderland. Drink me, eat me! And Shrigley is the White Rabbit. I am drawn in by a work called Dead and Dying. This is a mass of little bodies made of clay. You could find it comic or tragic. They are deformed, each one only three inches long, each moribund figure a sombre grey. Some are praying, kneeling on their scrawny and feeble knees. Their distorted hands clutch their damaged heads, their melancholic faces gouged out by Shrigley's hand. It offers an angle on the world \u2013 that pain and anguish occur too regularly, that death is omnipresent. It's reminiscent of Pompeian plaster casts, the final positions of the poor souls who perished there. His clay victims seem just as powerful. Shrigley is best known for his cartoons, and one wall displays more than 50 of them. The sketches are naively drawn, but the meaning and the punchlines are adult. One bears the title, \"The lecture you gave was not well received\", over a crowd of stickmen shouting \"Boring\", \"Rubbish\" and, \"I want to kill you.\" This mirrors the way Shrigley presents his art, and the way he expects us to react as an audience. Boring it is not. Rubbish? Well, you decide.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has the right instinct on tax. Get some sanity into child and housing benefit, relieve taxes at the bottom and, at the top, tax wealth rather than income. If so, there is no time like the present. The chancellor should drop the unloved 50% band of income tax and go for property. Housing is the most inefficient, mal-distributed, under-taxed and therefore overpriced asset in the land. Tax it properly, with something in return. Britons live more lavishly than any other big nation in Europe. More live in houses not flats, more have private gardens and more are home owners not renters. They also pay the lowest local taxes. What they do pay is a cockeyed, regressive, un-buoyant council tax, based on property valuations that bear little relation to actual or differential price. The top H band of council tax in the richer parts of the south-east embraces almost half of home owners. It is, in effect, a poll tax. Year after year the last Labour government funked revaluing England's council tax bands, meekly fearing that losers might howl louder than winners. The Welsh were bolder, revaluing in 2005 and now getting the benefit. Council tax on an I-band house in Gwynedd is higher than on a sheikh's palace in Kensington (\u00a32,870 against \u00a32,158). The Liberal Democrat answer is Vince Cable's \u00a32m mansion tax, an impost with built-in political impossibility. It is swingeing, posited at \u00a320,000 a year per mansion. It has a blatant cliff-edge effect, excusing houses just below the threshold yet savaging those above it. It evokes the \"granny tax\" protest, lacks regional variation and is merely a top-down fiscal wheeze to avoid the odium of rate revaluation. Meanwhile council tax remains the fiscal Cinderella, a miserable drudge of a thing, abused, beaten and kept in the localist broom cupboard. It was conjured into being by John Major's government in 1992 to purge the Tories of the stain of poll tax, while somehow pretending it was not a reversion to the rates. Council tax is unfair. Whereas under rates, the ratio of lowest to highest house valuation was roughly 1:100, the spread of the eight council tax bands is merely 1:3. The highest H band was \u00a3320,000 at 1991 prices (up to an average of \u00a3950,000 today). The bands have never been adjusted, while a growing sense of unfairness leads all governments to curry electoral favour by \"freezing\" council tax in favour of stealth taxes. The whole saga epitomises Britain's political cowardice. Osborne should follow gutsy Wales and introduce new upper bands that reflect the rise in house prices since the 1990s. He could do it now. Only the existing H band would need revaluing, and could be graduated in three stages to whatever value he chooses. The actual tax paid per band would still be determined by local councils. The allocation of properties to the new bands by currently under-employed estate agents would be no big deal. It must anyway be undertaken one day. Property is the easiest of all assets to tax because it the most visible, most recordable and most unavoidable. The private housing lobby is already hollering about losers, crying that any new top bands will \"unfairly target the income-poor and equity-rich\". This is like worrying about people who own Rolls-Royces they cannot afford to drive. The genteel poor may use inherited property inefficiently, but there is no reason for not taxing them for doing so. I cannot plead to be excused taxes because I get little benefit from them. The government is now proposing to \"tax\" housing benefit to reflect the number of rooms recipients leave unoccupied, and to discourage them from living in expensive properties. Taxing the living space of the rich is hardly unfair. Another group of much-bewailed losers is foreigners, many of whom pay neither taxes nor stamp duty. They can lump it. On one estimate, some 100,000 UK properties are now parked in offshore tax havens, which must comprise the bulk of the 155,000 houses in England and Wales thought to be worth more than \u00a31m. Why Gordon Brown left in place this massive tax loophole, costing some \u00a31bn a year, is a mystery. Nor are Britain's property taxes particularly high. New York's are fixed at between 1% and 2% of value. Westchester County's median property tax is $8,474, roughly three times the top rate in London's Kensington. Many New Yorkers pay $20,000 to $30,000. These can be partly offset against other taxes, but taxes they remain. There is another reason for raising taxes on property across the board. The biggest unexploited \u2013 and \"greenest\" \u2013 housing resource in Britain is empty and under-occupied property. There are empty rooms over shops, frozen by planning control. There are empty \"offshore\" mansions in central London. There are low plot ratios under urban renewal and more vacant commercial sites than ever. Britain is wasteful of residential land. An estimated million vacant homes are said to lie hidden within the urban and suburban landscape of Britain. Osborne is right to regard planning as one inhibitor of bringing them into use. Tax relief on residential lets would also help. The key here is to use the tax system as an aid to urban growth, properly so called. City sprawl is now a Europe-wide problem, with car-intensive building in the countryside increasing by 20% since 1980 to meet a population rise of just 6%. It may be impossible for a free market to \"monetise\" the value of open country for leisure and recreation, but it obviously makes sense to direct taxes at ensuring developed land is used more efficiently. We should tax its extravagant use and relieve taxes for public benefit. There is no denying the political price in progressive property taxes. The rich will pay more. But that price could be balanced by abandoning the 50p income tax band, which history suggests will raise little extra money. The net increase in revenue from council tax could then be diverted to the Liberal Democrat goal of a higher basic tax threshold. Each of these fiscal changes should yield pleasure somewhere on the political spectrum, while also delivering the chancellor a possible rise in overall revenue. Those who champion fiscal reform get precious few moments on stage. They no sooner start their song than they are deafened by cries of political expediency. This time the politics could just be in their favour. Might someone listen? \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

On one estimate, some 100,000 UK properties are now parked in offshore tax havens, which must comprise the bulk of the 155,000 houses in England and Wales thought to be worth more than \u00a31m. Why Gordon Brown left in place this massive tax loophole, costing some \u00a31bn a year, is a mystery.</p> <p>Nor are Britain's property taxes particularly high. New York's are fixed at between 1% and 2% of value. Westchester County's median property tax is $8,474, roughly three times the top rate in London's Kensington. Many New Yorkers pay $20,000 to $30,000. These can be partly offset against other taxes, but taxes they remain.</p> <p>There is another reason for raising taxes on property across the board. The biggest unexploited \u2013 and \"greenest\" \u2013 housing resource in Britain is empty and under-occupied property. There are empty rooms over shops, frozen by planning control. There are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/oct/16/empty-houses-london-wealthy-owners\" title=\"\">empty \"offshore\" mansions in central London</a>. There are low plot ratios under urban renewal and more vacant commercial sites than ever. Britain is wasteful of residential land. An estimated million vacant homes are said to lie hidden within the urban and suburban landscape of Britain. Osborne is right to regard planning as one inhibitor of bringing them into use. Tax relief on residential lets would also help.</p> <p>The key here is to use the tax system as an aid to urban growth, properly so called. City&#xa0;sprawl is now a Europe-wide problem, with car-intensive building in&#xa0;the countryside increasing by 20% since 1980 to meet a population rise of just 6%. It may be impossible for a free market to \"monetise\" the value of open country for leisure and recreation, but it obviously makes sense to direct taxes at ensuring developed land is used more efficiently. We should tax its extravagant use and relieve taxes for public benefit.</p> <p>There is no denying the political price in progressive property taxes. The rich will pay more. But that price could be balanced by abandoning the 50p income tax band, which history suggests will raise little extra money. The net increase in revenue from council tax could then be diverted to the Liberal Democrat goal of a higher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jan/26/lib-dems-options-tax-threshold\" title=\"\">basic tax threshold</a>. Each of these fiscal changes should yield pleasure somewhere on the political spectrum, while also delivering the chancellor a possible rise in overall revenue.</p> <p>Those who champion fiscal reform get precious few moments on stage. They no sooner start their song than they are deafened by cries of political expediency. This time the politics could just be in their favour.

      "bodyText": "Much has been written on Mitt Romney's rise ahead of Super Tuesday and Rick Santorum's relative decline. Indeed, Romney is on his way to having a good-to-great evening, while Santorum is likely to be disappointed by night's end. But what about Newt Gingrich? Can this GOP race's comeback specialist rise, Lazarus-like, from the grave one more time, to give his fans a final thrill? The answer is yes \u2013 though his reanimation is likely to be shortlived. Gingrich has camped out mostly in Georgia (Super Tuesday's greatest delegate prize), and it seems to be paying off. Despite a fall in the Georgia polls over the last month, Gingrich has seen a resurgence in recent weeks. He seems likely to win the state by 20 percentage points over Mitt Romney and capture the vast majority of the 76 delegates up for grabs. Gingrich's Georgia gains seem to be coming at the expense of Santorum. Santorum, who briefly passed Romney for second place in the Peach State, is now polling below 20%. If Santorum finishes at that level, he will not win any of Georgia's 31 at-large delegates; and he may not win any of the 42 congressional district delegates, either. Romney, meanwhile, will finish above 20% and is likely to win some district delegates, in addition. But Gingrich's boost has also spread across the state line into Tennessee. While Gingrich had looked unlikely to reach the 20% threshold required to win any of the 28 state-wide delegates just a few weeks, he now looks certain to win a healthy share of them. The HuffPollster sensitive trend has Gingrich within 3.5 percentage points of Santorum. The question now is whether he can ride that momentum and actually win the state. If Gingrich does, it gives him an even greater incentive to stay in the race. Unfortunately, for the former House speaker, however, his Ohio numbers have not risen significantly. Gingrich seems to be stuck in the mid-to-high teens, which is below the 20% threshold needed to win any of the 15 state-wide delegates. That percentage is high enough, though, to keep Santorum from consolidating the anti-Romney vote \u2013 and probably hands the state to Romney. We don't have enough polling data from the other primaries to understand whether Gingrich's late resurgence is manifesting itself in those places, as well. That said, the numbers we do have give us a fairly good idea that Gingrich's night is likely to be as \"good\" (comparatively speaking) as Santorum's. He can be predicted to win approximately as many delegates (75-90) as the former Pennsylvania senator \u2013 or even slightly more. These will be enough of a \"win\" for Gingrich to keep his campaign going past Super Tuesday. The real problem, then, for both Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum is that they will be still further behind frontrunner Mitt Romney in terms of delegates, organization and momentum.",

Again they showed courage, and discipline, to try to haul themselves out of a difficult situation. Even making this tie interesting was an achievement. As Wenger pointed out before the game, they somehow had to strike the right balance between attacking and defending. The only pity was that they did not have the attacking reinforcements from the bench to really crank it up. The out-of-favour Marouane Chamakh and Park Chu-young were the best they could do. 2 Italians stuck in first gear One of the oddest consequences of being in such command from the first leg is the difficulty for a team to psych themselves up for the task. That does not excuse Milan's extraordinary sluggishness. If Arsenal, as Kieran Gibbs suggested, were guilty of not \"turning up\" at San Siro, the same accusation could be thrown at Milan here. Their defensive lapses were extremely poor for all the goals that gave Arsenal a 3-0 half-time lead. Inept marking from a corner, uncharacteristic sloppiness from Thiago Silva, and a clumsy Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain sandwich put Milan in a position of anxiety they could barely have imagined having doled out that hammering three weeks ago. Van Bommel's early booking was another advantage for Arsenal, as he could ill afford any more reckless tackles. The question of whether this Milan team could be a contender and trouble the Spanish favourites got a pretty resounding answer here: not this time. 3 The real Rosicky stands up Wenger confessed before the game that he did not know what he would do if the Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky did not recover from an injury niggle to make the team. A player who promised so much when he signed from Borussia Dortmund in 2006, his Arsenal career has stuttered, mainly due to some horrendous injury problems. In the past couple of weeks he has shone, regaining the momentum to play with great personality, drive and guile in midfield. Having scored his first Premier League goal in two years to crown an action-packed display against Tottenham, he carried that form over with another performance full of purpose. His opportunist strike, for Arsenal's second goal, was deserved. A word, too, for Alex Song, whose exemplary display anchoring the Arsenal midfield underlines why his contract extension must be priority after Van Persie. 4 'The Ox' is the future Although he was selected in a more central role than anticipated, contrary to some of the pre-match speculation the teenager Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was deployed in a defensive midfield role, rather than as a playmaker. It had echoes of the education Wenger wanted Jack Wilshere to experience when he broke through, but was all the same a giant call to make in a game such as this against Mark van Bommel and Antonio Nocerino. Oxlade-Chamberlain was sensible in his positioning, tidy in possession, and able to demonstrate his technique with the beautifully whipped in cross for Laurent Koscielny to head in Arsenal's first goal. But it was hard to escape the feeling he was being reigned in, that he could make more of a difference. Then came the moment when he escaped the leash with a searing run into the box to win the penalty for Robin van Persie to make the score 3-0. The former Southampton player has come a long, long way since making his debut as a substitute 62 minutes into that infamous 8-2 thumping at Old Trafford. 5 Abbiati battered The Italian keeper Christian Abbiati had been watching from the bench the night Milan surrendered a 4-1 lead at Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a to suffer the consequences of the most dramatic turnaround in Champions League history. He, above all, deserves a pat on the back from his team-mates. A couple of important saves (added to the two fine efforts to ensure Van Persie did not score an away goal at San Siro) were vital. Milan were surprisingly open. For an Italian team to go away from home and play with an attacking trident hardly known for their capacity to track back in Zlatan Ibrahimovic flanked by Robinho and the youngster Stephan El Shaarawy was brave in a way. But it turned out to be a bad move, as a more conservative approach might have been more frustrating to Arsenal. As it was, there was not much of a barrier. The midfield area \u2013 where Wenger's team had no option but to experiment \u2013 was afforded far too much time and space to dictate the game. By all accounts the Milan coach was cross that it finished only 4-0 in the opener at San Siro. Now we know why.",

      "bodyText": "Chelsea might almost feel like presenting Birmingham City with a sum of money to equal the gate receipts here at St Andrew's. This FA Cup replay, which takes them to a home tie with Leicester City, provided the visitors with a generous helping of normality after the sacking of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. There was a clean sheet, even if little effort was called for to secure it, and John Terry's knee injury is less severe than it seemed since he was on the bench here as an unused substitute. Although Juan Mata was to fail from the penalty spot, Chelsea had little to concern them. The caretaker manager, Roberto Di Matteo, must have been eager to show that he could handle this assignment efficiently. An appointment will surely be made before long and it would help Di Matteo if he is seen as a trusty adviser to that newcomer. Complexities linger but they were invisible on Tuesday night. The game was mediocre at best and the goals were delayed until after the interval but there was nothing at all that preyed on Chelsea's nerves. Birmingham were far from full strength and that was all the more dismaying when Chelsea felt no need to pick all of their high-profile figures from the outset. Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and Michael Essien were named among the substitutes but that did not indicate demotion so much as Di Matteo's justified assumption that victory was well within reach of the line-up selected. Drogba was the one member of that trio not to take part eventually. In any circumstances under any Chelsea manager, it would have made sense to conserve strength for the Premier League and that second leg with Napoli in a Champions League tie where they lag 3-1. Chelsea had all the finesse required to win. Birmingham, sixth in the Championship, are trying to muster the momentum that could take them back to the top flight but their main feat here, with a greatly weakened line-up, was to match Chelsea before the interval. Even then they were tame. Despite the mundane quality of the win, this was still quite a night for Di Matteo. As a former Chelsea player he could draw on the sort of instinctive affection that was unavailable to Villas-Boas. Even so, the visiting fans seemed more intent on vetoing candidates than endorsing the caretaker manager. They were blunt in a chant that scorned the very notion of Rafael Ben\u00edtez filling the vacancy. The man in charge of Chelsea here does not depend solely on the affection of fans. Di Matteo may have been dismissed by West Bromwich Albion but there had been fine play and some good results before he suffered the rapid fall from grace. This win would have been welcomed. Chelsea have taken full points from just five away matches so far in this Premier League campaign. The challenge here was of a lower order but Chelsea still had to be efficient. Lampard, a box-to-box midfielder who turns 34 in June, was perhaps on the bench because Di Matteo sensed that he would do better by coming on as Birmingham faded. Even so, the match was mundane throughout. In general, there was a lack of individuals capable of menace. A header by Birmingham's Nikola Zigic that was tipped over the bar by Petr Cech in the 39th minute had to be deemed a highlight. When Fernando Torres did turn his marker and make space at the close of the first half, his effort was skewed off-target. This cannot have been the sort of quiet sought by Chelsea after the tumult of Villas-Boas's departure. Whoever does fill the vacancy will realise how much of a task he faces. The torpor in this game was stubborn in its refusal to leave the premises and the second half maintained the emphasis on industry over imagination. There was at least a hint of incisiveness in the 51st minute as Salomon Kalou played a pass to Mata inside the penalty area that called for a smart tackle by Pablo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. There was at least an indication then that Birmingham might buckle. The player who had been denied was soon to prevail. After 54 minutes Ramires crossed from the right and a blocked attempt by Salomon Kalou rebounded to Mata, who took his goal with a low finish. With an hour gone Raul Meireles extended the lead by shooting high into the net from the edge of the area. There might have been a third nine minutes later but Mata's penalty was saved by Colin Doyle after Guirane N'Daw had brought down Torres. All the same, there was little angst for anyone in Chelsea's colours.",

      "body": "<p>Chelsea might almost feel like presenting Birmingham City with a sum of money to equal the gate receipts here at St Andrew's. This FA Cup replay, which takes them to a home tie with Leicester City, provided the visitors with a generous helping of normality after the sacking of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas.</p> <p>There was a clean sheet, even if little effort was called for to secure it, and John Terry's knee injury is less severe than it seemed since he was on the bench here as an unused substitute. Although Juan Mata was to fail from the penalty spot, Chelsea had little to concern them.</p> <p>The caretaker manager, Roberto Di Matteo, must have been eager to show that he could handle this assignment efficiently. An appointment will surely be made before long and it would help Di Matteo if he is seen as a trusty adviser to that newcomer. Complexities linger but they were invisible on Tuesday night. The game was mediocre at best and the goals were delayed until after the interval but there was nothing at all that preyed on Chelsea's nerves.</p> <p>Birmingham were far from full strength and that was all the more dismaying when Chelsea felt no need to pick all of their high-profile figures from the outset. Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and Michael Essien were named among the substitutes but that did not indicate demotion so much as Di Matteo's justified assumption that victory was well within reach of the line-up selected. Drogba was the one member of that trio not to take part eventually.</p> <p>In any circumstances under any Chelsea manager, it would have made sense to conserve strength for the Premier League and that second leg with Napoli in a Champions League tie where they lag 3-1.</p> <p>Chelsea had all the finesse required to win. Birmingham, sixth in the Championship, are trying to muster the momentum that could take them back to the top flight but their main feat here, with a greatly weakened line-up, was to match Chelsea before the interval. Even then they were tame. Despite the mundane quality of the win, this was still quite a night for Di Matteo.</p> <p>As a former Chelsea player he could draw on the sort of instinctive affection that was unavailable to Villas-Boas.

      "bodyText": "The justice secretary, Ken Clarke, has admitted to being \"unsettled\" by criticism from lawyers about his plans for extending secret courts. Appearing before a parliamentary select committee, Clarke was forced to defend his plans against accusations that they were a \"corruption\" of the British legal system which undermined the tradition of open justice. The justice and security green paper, put out for consultation by the Ministry of Justice, proposes using \"closed material procedures\" to prevent sensitive intelligence being revealed in civil courts for the first time. Claimants would not be able to see the evidence against them and ministers would be able to make initial decisions about material that should be withheld. In some cases the full judgments would not be published at the end of a civil trial. The Conservative MP Richard Shepherd told Clarke he was very concerned about the integrity of the legal process, and described it as a \"corruption\" of the legal system. He said submissions by special advocates \u2013 who already appear in closed immigration appeal hearings \u2013 had described the green paper's proposals as \"an assault on common law principles\" and \"inherently unfair\". Clarke conceded: \"Of all the responses, the evidence of the special advocates most unsettled me. I was surprised by their strong reaction. It's important we take on board their strong strictures.\" The Liberal Democrat MP Mike Crockart said there was \"distrust about the motives behind this green paper\". But the justice secretary said the measures were about protecting the public. He said public interest immunity certificates were inadequate because they prevented evidence being shown to court. Closed material procedures, he said, would allow evidence to be put before a judge even if a claimant were not allowed to hear it. Clarke said: \"There's no one more concerned about open justice than I am. We are trying to see how open justice can be done in very restrictive circumstances. We are talking about where relevant evidence could be given by our intelligence services, our spies \u2013 where there's covert surveillance of various kinds, and where the parties are often unaware. \"Such evidence can't be used in open court [but] is often pertinent to the outcome of civil proceedings and can't be taken into account by the judge. I think that's extremely unsatisfactory. \"Our intelligence services should be accountable as far as is practicable if they are accused of malpractice of some kind. If I was a citizen I would like to know what the outcome was. \"But it's plainly not the case in any democracy in the world that you can have the countries' spies appearing in court openly and giving evidence about their [activities] and the technology they have used \u2013 or the means by which they infiltrated a terrorist organisation they are shadowing.\" When pressed Clarke gave few examples of cases where the government had had to settle because it could not present sensitive material to resist claims. He referred repeatedly to the Binyamin Mohamed case brought when the suspect had been released from Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The justice secretary also alluded to inquests in Northern Ireland that could not be completed because of disputes over security disclosures. The parliamentary joint human rights committee was told there were an estimated 27 legal claims being prepared, presumably similar to the Mohamed case, that were likely to raise sensitive security issues. James Brokenshire, the Home Office minister, said that there had been discussions with the intelligence services about the drafting of the green paper at early stages. Clarke insisted the green paper was a ministerial document drafted by civil servants. A white paper, fleshing out the details, is expected before the autumn. The committee also heard John Wadham, legal director of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, call the green paper proposals \"a fundamental departure from our common law principles\", while Eric Metcalfe, a barrister specialising in human rights law, warned its members that any attempt to limit the proposals to cases said to involve national security could still see a very large number being heard behind closed doors. An emergency motion is being put to this weekend's Liberal Democrat conference, expressing concern over the expansion of \"secret justice\". It is being supported by John Hemming MP and Sarah Ludford MEP. Responding to Clarke's words, Clare Algar, legal director at the charity Reprieve, said: \"At last it seems that the message is starting to get through to the government \u2013 that plans for a vast expansion of secret justice are deeply unfair. \"But it isn't enough just to be unsettled \u2013 it's time actually to act on the warnings of the people who know these processes from the inside, and who say they are fundamentally unfair. \"The government's proposals would effectively put politicians and their officials above the law, while excluding the public from their own legal system. \"We hope ministers will now see sense and drop these proposals before they wreck Britain's centuries-old tradition of open justice.\" Isabella Sankey, Liberty's director of policy, said: \"It's no surprise that having started with such sweeping proposals the government now hints at concessions. But minor nips and tucks won't make this chilling policy palatable. \"Secret courts for national security cases would have left CIA kidnap and torture victims locked out of their own civil claims and excluded bereaved relatives from the 7/7 inquest. \"The lord chancellor seeks to assure everyone that new laws will never be misused. No doubt that's what Gary McKinnon and others facing instant extradition thought was the case in 2003.\" A number of submissions made to the government during the consultation process that followed publication of the green paper have not been published, and the Cabinet Office is refusing to identify the organisations or individuals that have submitted them. One of the unpublished submissions is thought to have been made by Scotland Yard, and two have been made by unidentified private companies.",

      "bodyText": "Preamble: So here is Chelsea's first chance to prove that it was all AVB's fault. That that husky-voiced young interloper was so incompetent he made a perfectly dynamic bunch of footballers look washed-up and run-down. Will Roberto Di Matteo acknowledge the wisdom of the dressing room and pick the line-up that it dictates? Surely, for instance, he won't repeat the blunder of omitting Super Frankie Lampard? Of the 10 matches that Chelsea lost under Villas-Boas, Lord Lamps only featured in, um, 10. Hang on, that means Villas-Boas was unbeaten without Lampard! Petr Cech played in nine of those 10 defeats; Ashley Cole played in eight of them; John Terry played in six and was injured for the others; Didier Drogba played in five and got the same number of goals from open play as he got red cards; Fernando Torres writes his own punchlines. So the question, Roman, is the following: are you sure you got rid of the right person? Birmingham arrive at St Andrews tonight with lots of injury problems, which means AVB-free Chelsea should canter to victory, after which Chris Hughton should obviously be sacked on the spot. But what if Brum win? Then sack Roberto Di Matteo and hire a new caretaker; keep going like that and Roman will eventually find someone who'll tell him what's what. Oh, he already did, and that guy was ushered out of the Bridge too \u2026 and went on to win the Champions League with Inter and possibly Real Madrid soon too. So Roman, this mbm drone has no more advice to offer. But you're not reading this anyway, are you? And you're going to wind up appointing dear JT and Lamps as your dream manager-combo, aren't you? Oh Roman! Team news: No Lampard! No Cole! This has all the makings of caretaker managerial suicide! Or so Jamie Redknapp might say. Is this a sign of things to come from Di Matteo or is this a special 'FA Cup against lower league oppposition' selection? Either way, it's going to be interesting seeing Ryan Bertrand and it's a pity that Romelu Lukaku hasn't got a start, though perhaps this, at last, will be the game where Torres recovers his mojo. Any takers on that one? Birmingham: Doyle, Spector, Ibanez, Davies, N'Daw, Redmond, Mutch, Gomis, Elliott, Rooney, Zigic. Subs: Myhill, Burke, King, Valles, Reilly, Jervis, Packwood. Chelsea: Cech, Ivanovic, Luiz, Cahill, Bertrand, Ramires, Mikel, Meireles, Kalou, Torres, Mata. Subs: Hilario, Essien, Lampard, Drogba, Lukaku, Sturridge, Terry. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) A quibble: \"Those players you mention in the preamble have a combined 15 league titles and about 18 FA Cups,\" whimpers Nicholas, to which I offer a two-word reply. But which two-word reply? I'll go for this one: \"past glories\". Here: My colleague Jacob Steinberg has sent me this picture. How long before Chelsea fans are backtracking on that request? Oh, and by the way, a startlingly irate emailer named Bernard Keeling has demanded that I point out, again, that Birmingham are fielding a lot of fringe players tonight. I better do it in case he combust. 7:35pm: Roy Keane's is in splendid form on ITV. He made his intenteions clear from the start by saying \"some Chelsea players have let their manager down badly\" in reference to AVB's grim fate and then when the camers showed the players on the pitch at St Andrews gathering around Mikel to flick him in the ear and generally lark about, Keane thundered that they were \"stupid ... childish ... an absolute disgrace.\" Can I start the \"Di Matteo Out! Keane In!\" campaign now? 7.41pm: Di Matteo explains his team selection: \"I just wanted to freshen up the team a bit\". Is he calling those guys on the bench old? Talk likes that gets folks burnt at the stake down Chelsea way ... Words that have been said before \"You would think that today would have to be the day for Torres, if there is to be one,\" ventures Prateek Chadha. \"An opposition from a lower league, a side likely to play the ball into his feet and a new manager (even if he is a caretaker) who has shown more faith in him than some other senior members of the squad.\" 1 min: Brum kick off and immediately launch long towards Zigic. Well, not quite immediately as he would have been offisde, obviously. 2 min: Torres flicks on and suddenly Mata is scampering into the box ... the keeper comes out ot meet him ... Kalou is baying for a pass that would enable him to tap into the empty net ... but Mata dabs a feeble shot straight at the keeper. Doyle saves. 4 min: N'daw, as Jim Belgin has just pointed out, is being deployed at left-back and Ramires appears to have been assigned to exploiting him. With no effect so far. 6 min: Zigic with a dainty flick (yes, really) through for Rooney, who doesn't fancy his chances of racing into the box so instead tries to square to Redmond, but the pass is misdirected. Birmingham giving as good as they're getting so far. 8 min: My inbox is bulging with tributes to Dr Eva Caneiro, with football fans everywhere apparently pleased to see that she was not swept out with AVB. Clearly her medical knowledge is widely appreciated. 10 min: A very scruffy game so far, with Birmingham looking the more vigorous. They're winning the battles in midfield and Redmond looks lively wide on the left and Zigic seems to be in the mood to be a nuisance up front. No sign of Chelsea imposing any sort of Premier League class yet. 12 min: A lovely counter-attack by Birmingham, the highlight being a nifty exchange between Redmond and Zigic. Unfortunately the teenager (that's Redmond, by the way) miscontrolled just as they worked him into a prime shooting position. 15 min: Zigic's face is bloodied following a clash with Luiz, who flailed his arm in a way that was clumsy at best. \"What was amusing about the defeat at West Brom was that AVB selected the team most of the fans probably thought he should,\" qouth Ian Burch. \"Unfortunately Uncle Roy, like many managers this season, was too tactically astute for AVB. Also, teams are no longer that scared of Chelsea. Apart from Sturridge they don't have any players who can trouble opponents. Certainly Keane is right about the players letting AVB down, but it's all a shambles and it serves the club right. I'm not sure if my sides will burst from laughing at them or my head will off first from shaking in despair.\" I hear you. And on another note, my opinion, which is worth its weight in dodo traps, is that Roy Hodgson should be the next England manager. 17 min: Zigic is still off the pitch as his stigmata is stitched up, so Brum begin defending in depth. They were almost undone by some snappy interplay between Kalou and Ramires, with the latter poking over from 16 yards under pressure from Davies. 20 min: Plenty of noise at a full St Andrews,k adding to the fun. A sarcastic \"oooooooooooooh\" goes up when a misdirected Spector pass wobbles into Cech's arms. Meanwhile, in twitter, Oliver Kay reports that \"Chelsea fans at Birmingham singing \"F*** off Benitez, we don't want you here\" and chanting for Mourinho\". 23 min: Brave defending by David Luiz, who sticks his head where only Kevin Moran would venture to nut the ball clear before Rooney could connect with a flick into the six-yard box. 25 min: Zigic is back in the fray. And his first contribution is to nod the ball on to Elliot, who spins on the edge of the area and hooks a decent shot at goal, but it poses no problem for Cech. \"Who's this DIMattio fellow,\" carps Paul Conyngham. \"Looking at the photo that Jacob lent you, are these fans indulging in a bit of pre-SMS-era wrd rdction tcnqs, or did they just run out of sheet for their message? They should have used a double sheet, rather than one of their kids' sheets.\" Or just thought a little more before starting to write. A feeling I can empathise with, in fairness. 26 min: Nice cross from the right into the Birmingham box ... but it fell to the last person you'd want on the end of it ... and Torres' attempt to trap the ball results in him donking it into the keeper's grateful arms. 27 min: Mutch swings in a freekick from deep. Rooney rises but butts it way wide from 18 yards. 29 min: Zigic, who has seemed to be on a vengenace mission ever since copping that elbow, cops a deserved yellow card for a splenetic late tackle on Cahill. 31 min: Ramires romps past Ndaw down the right and centres for Torres, who attempts to swivel and shoot but is repelled and then knocks it to Kalou's whose shot from outside the box is blocked. Elsewhere, a penny for Daniel Farthing's thoughts? We have ourselves a deal: \"here's the perfect solution,\" emails Daniel. \"Wenger for Chelsea (adding fresh young blood to an inherited older squad to reap phenomenal success \u2013 sound familiar) and AVB for Arsenal (fresh young ideas applied to an impressionable squad of nippers young enough to regard his 34 years as old &amp; wise)\u2026 perfect!\" 33 min: Cahill nods wide from a Chelsea corner. 35 min: Chelsea so far seem content to keep Birmingham at arm's length, apparently in the belief that their presumed superior quality will enable them to counter incisively enough, possibly when the hosts tire. \"No offence but I'm going to follow the Arsenal mbm instead, that tie seems to be getting interesting!\" blurts Luke Crane and roughly 200 other splitters. Now I know how AVB felt. 38 min: Decent bout of pressure by Chelsea but Spector couldn't find a telling cross when given the chance. Chelsea defending well around the box. 40 min: Mutch raids down the right and then delivers a super cross that is rewarded with an equally super header by Zigic. Cech has to scramble backwards to prevent it from looping over him and into the net. Corner for Birmingham, which Meireles eventually clears. 43 min: Good pressure from Chelsea, but Mata's shot at the end of it is straight at Doyle. And you don't beat Doyles that easily. 44 min: Birmingham are having to defend desperately here as Chelsea finally begin to apply serious pressure. And when the visitors finally picked a way through, Torres, after shrugging off Davies impressively, dragged his shot badly wide from 16 yards. Half-time: Birmingham have played well but Chelsea appear to have surmounted the best that their hosts are going to muster tonight and started to get the upper hand in the last 10 minutes of the half. Bad finishing scuppered several half-chances for them but they'll likely get plenty more in the second half. Birmingham, with Zigic in impressive form, still carry some threat though. Most of you, however, are going to follow the Arsenal comeback/Milan captilation, aren't you? \"Just start making stuff up,\" counsel Philippa Booth. \"Any cat/squirrel/dog on the pitch antics will get you loads of hits.\" Golly, Chelsea appear to warming up a unicorn ... Half-time pep talk: \"I am going to splinter off to the Gunners as well, but if by the slim chance Torres actually pops a goal, please tell Barry to include it in his MBM. It should be in CAPS and BOLD to highlight the seriousness of the event.\" - Matthew Bathhurst. \"Just out of interest what are the rules on animals playing football [no Lee Cattermole jokes please]. I only ask because if Chelsea want to counteract some of this bad publicity they could do worse than fielding a football-playing golden retriever a la Air Bud. He couldn't be any worse than Torres and his shampoo sponsorships would probably be equally lucrative. Plus dogs are famously loyal so something for the nest manager to think about.\" - Alex H 46 min: We have resumption. No substitutions during the break. So that unicorn still awaits his big break ... 48 min: Cech hoofs a wonky clearance into the crowd, who jeer lustily. Chelsea fail to pick up Mutch from the throw-in and he is allowed to wriggle to the by-line and win a corner. \"Never mind unicorns, Paul, you need that even rarer of creatures, a Torres goal, to capture the popular imagination,\" squawks Phil Sawyer. \"According to myth and legend they used to exist in vast numbers, but now only denizens of a distant red land claim to have recollections that they used to exist.\" 49 min: Cech punches the corner out of the box ... Davies heads it back in ... Ndaw helps it on ... and Cech intervenes again, this time decisively. 50 min: Kalou slaloms his way into the box before slipping the ball through to Mata, whose shot is blocked brilliantly by Ibanez. GOAL! Birmingham 0-1 Chelsea (Mata 54') That is just reward for Chelsea's superior play in the second half. Ramires won the ball in midfield, romped forward and then curled a cross in from the right. That provoked chaos in the Brum defence and after a bout of ping-pong, Mata poked it into the net. \"A glimpse of a new daws\" bawls Peter Drury on ITV rather excitedly. 56 min: Redmond is robbed on the edge of the Chelsea area and suddenly Chelsea are on the counter. Torres has room to gallop down the left but when he attempts a pass towards Kalou he botches it badly. Chelsea substitution: Kalou off, Sturridge on. Birmingham substitution: Rooney off, Burke on. GOAL! Birmingham 0-2 Chelsea (Meireles 60') That's a superb goal! A nice build-up down the right culminated with an Ivanovic corss and then a smart lay-off from Ramires to Meireles, who smashed it into the top corner from 25 yards. That's why AVB liked him so much. 62 min: Notably that Meierles didn't celebrate his goal. Presumably out of solidarity for AVB. 63 min: Torres booked for a late tackle on Spector. 65 min: Ramires has tormented Ndaw tonight and the makeshift left-back decides to get his own back ... by kicking the Brazilian to the ground. Freekick to Chelsea in a promising position. 66 min: Zigic gets back to nod the freekick behind for a corner. 69 min: Chelsea re dominant now. Brum are broken. PENALTY! Ndaw clumsily brings down Torres. The fans bay for the Spaniard to take it himself ... 70 min: Well, the Spaniard did take it ... and Doyle saved! The Spaniard in question was Mata, who also missed one in the original match. Birmingham substitution: The hapless Ndaw off, King on. 74 min: Zigic flicks on towards King ... but Cahill slides in to knock the ball to safety just as the striker sized up a shot. 76 min: Lovely interplay down the right between Burke and Elliot forces Chelsea to concede a corner. It is cleared as far as Redmond, who spanks one over from 25 yards. Chelsea substitution: Ramires off, Chelsea jinx Lampard on. 77 min: Waht a miss! Torres cantered down the right and crossesd for Sturridge, who simply had to tap into the net from five ayrds ... but got the ball caught in his feet. 81 min: Burke splits the Chelsea defence with a wonderful pass to Mutch, who finds himself with only Cech to beat. But the ball bobbles as he hits it, taking his shot high over the bar. 83 min: Birmingham corner as David Luiz deflects a Zigic headear wide. Chelsea clear the set-piece. 86 min: Birmingham are besieging the Chelsea box as they seek to stay in the game but Cahill and David Luiz have repelled them very well. 88 min: No sooner had I praised the Chelsea centrebacks than Cahill nods the ball straight to King, who booms a shot at goal from 20 yards. Cech saves uncomfortably. Chelsea substitution: Mata off, Essien on. 90 mins: The fourth official has indicated (because that is all they ever do, apparently) that there will be a minimum of three more minutes. Full-time: Chelsea do the necessary, achieving a deserved victory thanks to some goof defending and two fine goals, particularly the second from Meireles - \"an absolute blooter\", according to ITV's Peter Drury.",

      "body": "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong><br>So here is Chelsea's first chance to prove that it was all AVB's fault. That that husky-voiced young interloper was so incompetent he made a perfectly dynamic bunch of footballers look washed-up and run-down. Will Roberto Di Matteo acknowledge the wisdom of the dressing room and pick the line-up that it dictates? Surely, for instance, he won't repeat the blunder of omitting Super Frankie Lampard? Of the 10 matches that Chelsea lost under Villas-Boas, Lord Lamps only featured in, um, 10. Hang on, that means Villas-Boas was unbeaten without Lampard! </p> <p>Petr Cech played in nine of those 10 defeats; Ashley Cole played in eight of them; John Terry played in six and was injured for the others; Didier Drogba played in five and got the same number of goals from open play as he got red cards; Fernando Torres writes his own punchlines. So the question, Roman, is the following: are you sure you got rid of the right person?</p> <p>Birmingham arrive at St Andrews tonight with lots of injury problems, which means AVB-free Chelsea should canter to victory, after which Chris Hughton should obviously be sacked on the spot. But what if Brum win? Then sack Roberto Di Matteo and hire a new caretaker; keep going like that and Roman will eventually find someone who'll tell him what's what. Oh, he already did, and that guy was ushered out of the Bridge too \u2026 and went on to win the Champions League with Inter and possibly Real Madrid soon too. So Roman, this mbm drone has no more advice to offer. But you're not reading this anyway, are you? And you're going to wind up appointing dear JT and Lamps as your dream manager-combo, aren't you?</p> <p>Oh Roman!</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news: </strong><br>No Lampard! No Cole! This has all the makings of caretaker managerial suicide! Or so Jamie Redknapp might say. Is this a sign of things to come from Di Matteo or is this a special 'FA Cup against lower league oppposition' selection? Either way, it's going to be interesting seeing Ryan Bertrand and it's a pity that Romelu Lukaku hasn't got a start, though perhaps this, at last, will be the game where Torres recovers his mojo.

      "bodyText": "Good evening everybody. You'd bet on a one-legged man to win an arse-kicking competition before risking it on Arsenal to overturning their 4-0 first leg deficit against AC Milan in tonight's Champions League last 16 second leg. But as my podcasting chum James Richardson said in yesterday's episode of our podcast Football Weekly, it's going to be fun to watch them try. Without going into the minutiae of what I'm sure were complex mathematical calculations, Arsene Wenger has stated that he puts Arsenal's chances of emerging triumphant from this tie at 5%, which makes Arsenal ... [minute-by-minute reporter counts on fingers] ... 19-1 longshots, but renders their cause far from hopeless, even if they are just one kick or header of the football away from needing six goals, rather than the comparatively derisory four that would put them in a penalty shootout. \"We'll put out the best possible team to qualify,\" said Wenger in yesterday's press conference. \"We want to have a real go and make it possible. Of course we will have to drive forward. The best way is to ignore the first game \u2013 we can score goals. In the last two home [Premier League] games we scored 12, so we know we can.\" Arsenal players can take heart from the fact that Milan have high profile previous in the field of Champions League collapses, having thrown away a 4-1 first leg lead to lose against Deportivo La Coruna in 2004, then allowing Liverpool to come back from 3-0 down at half-time to beat them on penalties in the final the following year. Small wonder, then, that their coach Massimiliano Allegri has been urging against compacency ... even though he'd probably be doing it anyway even if he thought his side were already home and hosed. \"When you're playing in the last 16 of the Champions League in London against Arsenal, despite being 4-0 up, I would never expect my team to relax,\" he said. \"In football you never know what might happen \u2013 so we need to forget the first game and focus on qualifying for the next round.\" The Gooners are going to get thumped, aren't they? Arsenal: Szczesny, Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Rosicky, Song, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Walcott, van Persie, Gervinho. Subs: Fabianski, Park, Djourou, Jenkinson, Chamakh, Miquel, Ozyakup. AC Milan: Abbiati, Abate, Mexes, Thiago Silva, Mesbah, Nocerino, Van Bommel, Emanuelson, Ibrahimovic, Robinho, El Shaarawi. Subs: Amelia, Aquilani, Zambrotta, Bonera, Ganz, Yepes, Roma. Referee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia) That's an attacking looking Arsenal side: But then, it needs to be. Despite doubts about their fitness, Kieran Gibbs and Tomas Rosicky will start, with the latter on the right-hand side of a midfield trio comprised of Alex Song in the centre and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right. Up front, Robin van Persie will lead the line, with Gervinho on his left and Theo Walcott on his right. Meanwhile in the Milan XI: Like Arsenal, the Italians will line up in a 4-3-3, albeit one that's likely to be less anxious to play expansively and get forward. In midfield, Mark van Bommel will do his usual job of kicking anything in a red shirt that attempts to run at the back four he's shielding, while Antonio Nocerino and Urby Emanuelson will play further forward on his right and left respectively. Up front, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Stephen El Shaarawy will line up on the right and left of Robinho, where they will no doubt attempt to cripple Arsenal with lightning fast counter-attacks. Prediction time: I can't see Arsenal winning this match, let alone the tie: Arsenal 1-3 AC Milan. Not long now: The players emerge from the tunnel, with Arsenal's players kitted out in their usual home strip of red shirts with white sleeves, white shorts and white socks. Milan's players wear black shirts shorts and socks with the three red stripes of Adidas on their sleeves, shorts and socks. Pre-match niceties: Skippers Robin van Persie and Christian Abbiati exchange pennants, the ref tosses the coin and Arsenal kick off playing from left to right. 1 min: Arsenal immediately go on the attack, switching from left flank to right, before working the ball all the way back to Wojciech Szczesny, via Laurent Koscielny. 2 min: Excellent play from Arsenal, who attack down the right-hand side, only for Theo Walcott to be caught offside as he makes a dartying run towards the edge of the six-yard box to get on the end of a short pass from Rosicky. 4 min: AC Milan attack, with Robinho trying to work an opening for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, only for Bacary Sagna to clear. 5 min: Amazing scenes! Mark van Bommel gets booked for his first tackle of the game, on Rosicky. Normally he gets away with seven or eight of those fouls before the referee even contemplates showing him a card. GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 AC Milan (Agg: 1-4) (Koscielny 5) Well, well well ... Arsenal win a corner, which Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain whips in to the near post. Completely unmarked, Laurent Koscielny nods home from just outside the six-yard box. 9 min: That early goal was just what the doctor ordered for Arsenal and has got the Emirates rocking. Arsenal need to be careful, though - they've looked vulnerable ever since scoring. 11 min: The early signs are promising for Arsenal, with both Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott having started brightly. On Sky Sports, match analyst Gary Neville suggests they should try dribbling towards Mark van Bommel at pace, in the hope of getting the slow, immobile midfielder sent off. 14 min: Bacary Sagna gets booked for a mistimed tackle on the slow, immobile midfielder Mark Van Bommel. 14 min: Thiago Silva does well to dispossess Theo Walcott in the Milan penalty area, shepherd the ball out to the flank under pressure from the Arsenal forward and hack clear. 15 min: Kieran Gibbs gets booked for sweeping the legs out from under Stephen El Shaarawy: free-kick for Milan, just to the right of Arsenal penalty area. The ball's whipped in to the penalty area, where Gibbs clears. 17 min: Arsenal carve open the Milan defence, courtesy of Rosicky and Van Persie. It's two on two as the former passes to the latter, albeit a mite too early. Under pressure from Thiago Silva, Van Persie is forced to pass the ball back to Rosicky, but his delivery is wayward and goes behind the midfielder. On the edge of the penalty area, being marked by Mexes, Rosicky backtracks, picks up the ball and plays it between defenders, but his pass is too weighty and Abbiati beats Van Persie to the ball, earning a free-kick when the Arsenal captain challenges him. Arsenal should have scored there. 20 min: Christian Abbiati is forced to fling himself to his right to palm a Robin van Persie shot from just outside the penalty area around his right upright. From the ensuing corner, Arsenal win another one. For the first time this evening Alex O-C's delivery is poor and fails to clear the first man, allowing under-siege Milan to clear their lines. 22 min: Arsenal continue attacking, with Alex O-C on the edge of the final third, attempting to dink the ball over the top of Milan defence and on to the head of Van Persie. Milan clear. 24 min: Arsenal attack down Milan's right flank again, having clearly identified Milan left-back Djamel Mesbah as a weak link. The link-up play between Song, Gervinho and Walcott is marvellous, releasing ... oh my word! GOAL! Arsenal 2-0 AC Milan (Agg: 2-4) (Rosicky 25) With Milan having repelled one attack down the right, Arsenal go down that flank again, courtesy of Walcott. Mesbah stands off him, allowing him to drive in a low hard cross. Thiago Abate's clearance is dismal and only goes as far as Tomas Rosicky, who coolly slots the ball into the bottom right-hand corner from about 18 yards. 28 min: On the goggler, Gary Neville is stressing the importance for Arsenal to defend. He points out that they will inevitably get another four or five chances to score, so their priority should be to keep their heads and avoid conceding a goal. Remember, if they do ship one, they'll be straight back to square one with a four-goal deficit to overcome. 29 min: From the edge of the final third, Tomas Rosicky slips the ball through to Robin van Persie, who has his back to goal in the penalty area. He tries to take possession on the turn, but is robbed by Thiago Silva, who hoofs clear. 32 min: AC Milan go on a rare sortie out of their own half, courtesy of Urby Emmanuelson. The ball finds its way cross-field to Ignazio Abate, who shoots straight into the gloves of Wojciech Szczesny. 34 min: Robinho attacks Arsenal down the right touchline, cuts inside and runs into Gervinho. The ball cannons off the Arsenal forward's shins and looks to be going out for a corner, but Kieran Gibbs hacks it out for a throw-in before it crosses the line. Funnily enough, if Roninho had looked up there, he would have seen Stephen El Shaarawy loitering with intent on the edge of the six-yard box. 37 min: From the left flank, Robin van Persie sends a low cross into the Milan penalty area, where Gervinho and Walcott are waiting. Thiago Silva intercepts and clears. 38 min: Arsenal free-kick, about 45 yards from goal. Robin van Persie tries to drop the ball in over the edge of the six-yard box, but completely miscues and fails to get any lift on it, failing to clear the first defender. 39 min: Theo Walcott sets off on a gallop down the right flank and is taken out by beleaguered full-back Djamel Mesbah, who he's been tormenting all night. The Arsenal winger goes down holding his thigh, but is fit to continue after receiving treatment. 40 min: Penalty for Arsenal! They attack down the right flank again courtesy of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who cuts into the box where Mesbah and Nocerino hack him down. GOAL! Arsenal 3-0 AC Milan (Agg: 3-4) (Van Persie 43pen) Robin van Persie buries the ball past Christian Abiatti! That's a splendid, unstoppable penalty. 44 min: You'd have to say Arsenal are the favourites to win this tie at this stage, as long as they don't lose the run of themselves and forget to defend stoutly. They've been making hay down the right wing, where the visitors' left-back Djamel Mesbah looks like some supporter who's won a competition where first prize was the opportunity to play for AC Milan in a Champions League match. He's having a shocker. 45+1 min: A lapse in concentration results in Stephen El Shaarawy being put clean through on goal with only Wojciech Szczesny to beat. Bearing down on goal from right to left, he fires across the keeper's bows only to see his shot fizz hopelessly wide. That's a let-off for the Gooners; he really should have scored there. Half-time Arsenal go off having reduced their arrears by 75%. They were 33-1 to qualify for the next round before the start of play tonight, now they're 5-6 favourites. Half-time punditry: Having spent several minutes ripping Milan's players a new one for their poor marking at set pieces and even poorer attitude going into this match, Sky pundits Graeme Souness, Alan Smith and Ruud Gullit are now singing the praises of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, just one of several home players who've been excellent tonight. Saltuk Ozertuk writes: \"I am a huge Arsenal fan, and I am really scared now,\" he says. \"Can we ever recover from going up 5-0 and then conceding a last minute goal to win 5-1 but lose the tie on away goals?\" There's always one: Having taken the time and trouble to copy and paste my predictions from earlier in the report into an email, the utterly charming and delightful Adal Mirza has writen this lovely missive: \"Guardian sports writers getting it spot on again. Are you wearing your Man Utd shirt? Wear it proud mind.\" You have to hand it to Adal and people like him (there are a lot of them about) - not content with being sore losers, they're so enraged and embittered with their lot in life that they seem incapable of enjoying the good times either. No doubt Adal was confident Arsenal would be 3-0 up at half-time tonight; probably as certain about it as he is that anyone who thought that Arsenal might struggle to overcome a 4-0 deficit against Milan must be a Manchester United fan. Second half: And we're off ... there don't appear to be any changes on either side. That seems odd to me, as I'd suggest Milan would be better off playing with 10 man rather than 11 including Djamel Mesbah. 49 min: From a Milan free-kick that might as well be a corner, Stephen El Shaaraway heads wide at the far post. He should have done better. 50 min: Early in this half, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain went down with what looked like a hamstring injury, but he appears to have recovered, which is good news for Arsenal. 53 min: Theo Walcott tries to square the ball across the face of goal for Gervinho, who was free in space. A Miilan defender sticks out a leg and makes a vital interception. 54 min: Great goalkeeping from Wojciech Szczesny, who dashes off his line to hack clear a through-ball which was being chased down by Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 54 min: Theo Walcott picks up the ball on the right flank, waltzes past the hapless Djamel Mesbah and tries to square the ball across the face of the Milan goal. At the near post, Thiago Silva clears. 56 min: For all his shortcomings, it could be argued that Djamel Mesbah is being left horribly exposed by his team-mates. Stephen El Sharawy and Urby Emanuelson are doing little or nothing to help him. 57 min: Alex Song gets booked for a foul on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, seven or eight yards outside the Milan penalty area, a tad right of centre. Urby Emanuelson tries his luck, but his effort is sloppy enough to prompt a bout of angry gesticulating from his manager on the touchline. 59 min: A Gervinho shot from about 11 yards takes a wicked deflection off a defender, but hits the legs of the wrong-footed Abbiati in the Milan goal. The ball rebounds to Robin van Persie on the edge of the six yard box, but rather than sidefoot it into one of the corners, he tries to lift it over the goalkeeper, who anticipates his intentions in advance, sticks up a hand and saves. You'd have bet the farm on Van Persie scoring there! 60 min: \"Aren't you always being accused of pro-Arsenal bias?\" asks Eamonn Maloney. \"The agony and indeed, the irony.\" Well, so far today, I've been accused of anti-Newcastle and anti-Chelsea bias, plus pro-Manchester United bias. That's not bad for a slow Tuesday. 63 min: Arsenal dodge a bullet there, when Zlatan Ibrahimovic pounces on a loose pass from Wojciech Szczesny to Alex Song, dispossesses the midfielder before he can control it and then shoots wide of a goal that was at his mercy. The mightily relieved Arsenal goalkeeper raises his hand by way of apology to his team-mates. 65 min: Bacary Sagna tries to pick out Robin van Persie with an inswinger of a cross from the right flank. Christian Abbiati dashes off his line and leaps to punch clear. 68 min: Milan are gifted possession and embark on a counter-attack when Tomas Rosicky miscontrols a pass from Alex Song with his chest. The move ends when Urby Emanuelson fails to get hold of a shot from distance and Wojciech Szczesny gets down to save easily. 71 min: Milan substitution: Stephen El Shaarawy off, Alberto Aquilani on. Yes, that Alberto Aquilani, the Harry Potter lookalike who's on loan at Milan from Liverpool. He's just returning from a long-term injury and probably wasn't expecting to get thrown into a cauldron this hot and bubbly on his comeback. 73 min: Theo Walcott picks up the ball on the right flank and tries to cut inside one ... two ... three players, rather than go around the woeful Djamel Mesbah on the outside. In the end, Walcott tries to take on one player too many and is crowded off the ball. 75 min: Arsenal substitution: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain off, Marouane Chamakh on. The under-performing Moroccan has big boots to fill and will probably never get a better chance to salvage his reputation as an Arsenal player. 75 min: Antonio Nocerino tries a shot from distance, Szczesny can only parry, but Kieran Gibbs is on hand to hack clear when the ball could have pinged anywhere. 77 min: Christ on a bike - a quite astonishing miss by Antonio Nocerino, who shoots straight at Szczesny with the outside of his right boot from about three yards out when he had half the goal gaping in front of him and all the time in the world to sidefoot the ball into it. 79 min: Gervinho takes on Philippe Mexes down the left flank, but the defender stands his ground, sticks out a leg and sends the ball cannoning off the Arsenal winger's shins. 81 min: Theo Walcott is hobbling and wincing, having apparently picked up a knock on his left leg. 82 min: With Walcott lying on the ground in the Milan penalty area, Rosicky tries to thread the ball through the defence for Robin van Persie. Philippe Mexes intercepts and clears. 84 min: Arsenal substitution: Theo Walcott off, Park Ji-Young on. 84 min: Milan win a free-kick just outside the D of the Arsenal penalty area. 86 min: Zlatan Ibrahimovic shoots the ball straight into the wall, where it hits Bacary Sagna and goes out for a corner ... only for the referee to award a goal-kick. Antonio Nocerino points out the referee's error and has a moan, only to be booked for his trouble. 87 min: Another Arsenal attack down the right flank, another Bacary Sagna cross wafts in the general direction of Robin van Persie. It's not close enough to the Dutchman and Milan clear. 88 min: Milan substitution: Djamel Mesbah gets put out of his misery and walks off very slowly - his first worthwhile contribution to his team's cause this evening. He's replaced by Daniele Bonera. 90 min: There'll be three minutes of added time, in which Arsenal must score a goal if they are to avoid being eliminated from this season's Champions League. 92 min: Alex Song dispossesses Zlatan Ibrahimovic on the edge of the Arsenbal penalty area and sets off on the counter-attack. He tries to pick out Robin van Persie, but succeeds only in gifting possession back to Milan. 90+3 min: Wojciech Szczesny is waved forward by his manager as Arsenal win as free-kick, which is wasted. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It's all over. Despite a heroic attempt at coming back from 4-0 down, Arsenal are out of Europe and their players look as thoroughly gutted as their Milan couterparts appear visibly relieved. The Italian side were awful this evening, but hung in bravely throughout the second half to scrape through to the quarter-finals. That was a dogged second-half performance, which has helped them avoid becoming an international laughing stock.",

The link-up play between Song, Gervinho and Walcott is marvellous, releasing ... oh my word!</p> <!-- Block 22 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387049308\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273742993249/MBM-goal-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM goal\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 2-0 AC Milan (Agg: 2-4) (Rosicky 25)</strong> With Milan having repelled one attack down the right, Arsenal go down that flank again, courtesy of Walcott. Mesbah stands off him, allowing him to drive in a low hard cross. Thiago Abate's clearance is dismal and only goes as far as Tomas Rosicky, who coolly slots the ball into the bottom right-hand corner from about 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> On the goggler, Gary Neville is stressing the importance for Arsenal to defend. He points out that they will inevitably get another four or five chances to score, so their priority should be to keep their heads and avoid conceding a goal. Remember, if they do ship one, they'll be straight back to square one with a four-goal deficit to overcome.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> From the edge of the final third, Tomas Rosicky slips the ball through to Robin van Persie, who has his back to goal in the penalty area. He tries to take possession on the turn, but is robbed by Thiago Silva, who hoofs clear.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> AC Milan go on a rare sortie out of their own half, courtesy of Urby Emmanuelson. The ball finds its way cross-field to Ignazio Abate, who shoots straight into the gloves of Wojciech Szczesny.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Robinho attacks Arsenal down the right touchline, cuts inside and runs into Gervinho. The ball cannons off the Arsenal forward's shins and looks to be going out for a corner, but Kieran Gibbs hacks it out for a throw-in before it crosses the line. Funnily enough, if Roninho had looked up there, he would have seen Stephen El Shaarawy loitering with intent on the edge of the six-yard box.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> From the left flank, Robin van Persie sends a low cross into the Milan penalty area, where Gervinho and Walcott are waiting. Thiago Silva intercepts and clears.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Arsenal free-kick, about 45 yards from goal. Robin van Persie tries to drop the ball in over the edge of the six-yard box, but completely miscues and fails to get any lift on it, failing to clear the first defender.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Theo Walcott sets off on a gallop down the right flank and is taken out by beleaguered full-back Djamel Mesbah, who he's been tormenting all night. The Arsenal winger goes down holding his thigh, but is fit to continue after receiving treatment.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Penalty for Arsenal! They attack down the right flank again courtesy of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who cuts into the box where Mesbah and Nocerino hack him down.</p> <!-- Block 31 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387049309\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273742993249/MBM-goal-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM goal\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 3-0 AC Milan (Agg: 3-4) (Van Persie 43pen)</strong> Robin van Persie buries the ball past Christian Abiatti! That's a splendid, unstoppable penalty.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> You'd have to say Arsenal are the favourites to win this tie at this stage, as long as they don't lose the run of themselves and forget to defend stoutly. They've been making hay down the right wing, where the visitors' left-back Djamel Mesbah looks like some supporter who's won a competition where first prize was the opportunity to play for AC Milan in a Champions League match. He's having a shocker.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> A lapse in concentration results in Stephen El Shaarawy being put clean through on goal with only Wojciech Szczesny to beat. Bearing down on goal from right to left, he fires across the keeper's bows only to see his shot fizz hopelessly wide. That's a let-off for the Gooners; he really should have scored there.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Arsenal go off having reduced their arrears by 75%. They were 33-1 to qualify for the next round before the start of play tonight, now they're 5-6 favourites.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Half-time punditry:</strong> Having spent several minutes ripping Milan's players a new one for their poor marking at set pieces and even poorer attitude going into this match, Sky pundits Graeme Souness, Alan Smith and Ruud Gullit are now singing the praises of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, just one of several home players who've been excellent tonight.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Saltuk Ozertuk writes:</strong> \"I am a huge Arsenal fan, and I am really scared now,\" he says. \"Can we ever recover from going up 5-0 and then conceding a last minute goal to win 5-1 but lose the tie on away goals?\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>There's always one:</strong> Having taken the time and trouble to copy and paste my predictions from earlier in the report into an email, the utterly charming and delightful Adal Mirza has writen this lovely missive: \"Guardian sports writers getting it spot on again. Are you wearing your Man Utd shirt? Wear it proud mind.\"</p> <p>You have to hand it to Adal and people like him (there are a lot of them about) - not content with being sore losers, they're so enraged and embittered with their lot in life that they seem incapable of enjoying the good times either. </p> <p>No doubt Adal was confident Arsenal would be 3-0 up at half-time tonight; probably as certain about it as he is that anyone who thought that Arsenal might struggle to overcome a 4-0 deficit against Milan <em>must</em> be a Manchester United fan.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Second half:</strong> And we're off ... there don't appear to be any changes on either side. That seems odd to me, as I'd suggest Milan would be better off playing with 10 man rather than 11 including Djamel Mesbah.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> From a Milan free-kick that might as well be a corner, Stephen El Shaaraway heads wide at the far post. He should have done better.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Early in this half, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain went down with what looked like a hamstring injury, but he appears to have recovered, which is good news for Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Theo Walcott tries to square the ball across the face of goal for Gervinho, who was free in space. A Miilan defender sticks out a leg and makes a vital interception.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Great goalkeeping from Wojciech Szczesny, who dashes off his line to hack clear a through-ball which was being chased down by Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Theo Walcott picks up the ball on the right flank, waltzes past the hapless Djamel Mesbah and tries to square the ball across the face of the Milan goal. At the near post, Thiago Silva clears.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> For all his shortcomings, it could be argued that Djamel Mesbah is being left horribly exposed by his team-mates. Stephen El Sharawy and Urby Emanuelson are doing little or nothing to help him.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Alex Song gets booked for a foul on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, seven or eight yards outside the Milan penalty area, a tad right of centre. Urby Emanuelson tries his luck, but his effort is sloppy enough to prompt a bout of angry gesticulating from his manager on the touchline.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> A Gervinho shot from about 11 yards takes a wicked deflection off a defender, but hits the legs of the wrong-footed Abbiati in the Milan goal. The ball rebounds to Robin van Persie on the edge of the six yard box, but rather than sidefoot it into one of the corners, he tries to lift it over the goalkeeper, who anticipates his intentions in advance, sticks up a hand and saves. You'd have bet the farm on Van Persie scoring there!</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> \"Aren't you always being accused of <em>pro</em>-Arsenal bias?\" asks Eamonn Maloney. \"The agony and indeed, the irony.\" Well, so far today, I've been accused of anti-Newcastle and anti-Chelsea bias, plus pro-Manchester United bias. That's not bad for a slow Tuesday.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Arsenal dodge a bullet there, when Zlatan Ibrahimovic pounces on a loose pass from Wojciech Szczesny to Alex Song, dispossesses the midfielder before he can control it and then shoots wide of a goal that was at his mercy. The mightily relieved Arsenal goalkeeper raises his hand by way of apology to his team-mates.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Bacary Sagna tries to pick out Robin van Persie with an inswinger of a cross from the right flank. Christian Abbiati dashes off his line and leaps to punch clear.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Milan are gifted possession and embark on a counter-attack when Tomas Rosicky miscontrols a pass from Alex Song with his chest. The move ends when Urby Emanuelson fails to get hold of a shot from distance and Wojciech Szczesny gets down to save easily.</p> <!-- Block 51 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387049310\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273743391802/MBM-substitution-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Milan substitution: Stephen El Shaarawy off, Alberto Aquilani on. Yes, that Alberto Aquilani, the Harry Potter lookalike who's on loan at Milan from Liverpool. He's just returning from a long-term injury and probably wasn't expecting to get thrown into a cauldron this hot and bubbly on his comeback.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Theo Walcott picks up the ball on the right flank and tries to cut inside one ... two ... three players, rather than go around the woeful Djamel Mesbah on the outside. In the end, Walcott tries to take on one player too many and is crowded off the ball.</p> <!-- Block 53 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387049311\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273743391802/MBM-substitution-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Arsenal substitution: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain off, Marouane Chamakh on. The under-performing Moroccan has big boots to fill and will probably never get a better chance to salvage his reputation as an Arsenal player.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Antonio Nocerino tries a shot from distance, Szczesny can only parry, but Kieran Gibbs is on hand to hack clear when the ball could have pinged anywhere.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Christ on a bike - a quite <em>astonishing</em> miss by Antonio Nocerino, who shoots straight at Szczesny with the outside of his right boot from about three yards out when he had half the goal gaping in front of him and all the time in the world to sidefoot the ball into it.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Gervinho takes on Philippe Mexes down the left flank, but the defender stands his ground, sticks out a leg and sends the ball cannoning off the Arsenal winger's shins.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Theo Walcott is hobbling and wincing, having apparently picked up a knock on his left leg.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> With Walcott lying on the ground in the Milan penalty area, Rosicky tries to thread the ball through the defence for Robin van Persie. Philippe Mexes intercepts and clears.</p> <!-- Block 59 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387049312\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273743391802/MBM-substitution-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Arsenal substitution: Theo Walcott off, Park Ji-Young on.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Milan win a free-kick just outside the D of the Arsenal penalty area.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Zlatan Ibrahimovic shoots the ball straight into the wall, where it hits Bacary Sagna and goes out for a corner ... only for the referee to award a goal-kick. Antonio Nocerino points out the referee's error and has a moan, only to be booked for his trouble.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Another Arsenal attack down the right flank, another Bacary Sagna cross wafts in the general direction of Robin van Persie. It's not close enough to the Dutchman and Milan clear.</p> <!-- Block 63 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387049313\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273743391802/MBM-substitution-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Milan substitution: Djamel Mesbah gets put out of his misery and walks off very slowly - his first worthwhile contribution to his team's cause this evening. He's replaced by Daniele Bonera.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There'll be three minutes of added time, in which Arsenal must score a goal if they are to avoid being eliminated from this season's Champions League.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>92 min:</strong> Alex Song dispossesses Zlatan Ibrahimovic on the edge of the Arsenbal penalty area and sets off on the counter-attack. He tries to pick out Robin van Persie, but succeeds only in gifting possession back to Milan.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> Wojciech Szczesny is waved forward by his manager as Arsenal win as free-kick, which is wasted.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep!</strong> It's all over. Despite a heroic attempt at coming back from 4-0 down, Arsenal are out of Europe and their players look as thoroughly gutted as their Milan couterparts appear visibly relieved. The Italian side were awful this evening, but hung in bravely throughout the second half to scrape through to the quarter-finals. That was a dogged second-half performance, which has helped them avoid becoming an international laughing stock.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is a wincing little scene right at the end of John Patrick Shanley's 2008 film, Doubt. The film is set in a Catholic church in the Bronx in 1964, and the action focuses on the suspicions aroused in the steely mind of the principal of the parish school, Sister Aloysius, about the conduct of the liberal-minded parish priest, Father Flynn. Sister Aloysius bullies Father Flynn into resigning, but in the final scene she confesses to another sister that she lied in order to get rid of him. Then, her steely facade disintegrating, Sister Aloysius bursts into tears as she speaks the last words in the film: \"I have doubts \u2026 I have such doubts.\" We are not told what it is she doubts, but we conclude that behind her severe and implacable front there lies a mind riven with uncertainty about the truth of the very beliefs she has given her life to. This is a well-understood phenomenon and it is one few of us have not experienced. We understand how often the proclamation of excessive loyalty is a cloak to hide unbearable doubt, even from ourselves. Doubt can be unbearable. It is one of our most painful experiences; but when we attend to what is happening and try to understand it, it can be the prelude to liberation and a kind of rueful peace of mind. Standing at the altar, doubting whether you can keep the promises you are about to make to the person standing beside you, can be a summons to accept the tremendousness of the commitment you are about to engage in, or it can be a signal to you to do the honest thing and get out of there right away. If doubt about earthly commitments is hard enough to deal with honestly, doubt about heavenly ones is even more difficult. We can test the scope and significance of an earthly doubt, but how are we to test the scope of a heavenly one, a supernatural one? It is this intractability that lends a note of desperation to religious debate and leads to the development of conflicted personalities like Sister Aloysius. It is why religious leaders in their public pronouncements on complex issues are often tempted to take their rhetoric too far. We heard it from Lord Carey recently, when he claimed to see in the genial secularity of contemporary Britain the prelude to full-blown religious persecution. And at the weekend we heard it again from Cardinal O'Brien in his latest fulmination against allowing same-sex couples to marry. It is striking that when these otherwise kindly and even-tempered men clap on their mitres to address the nation, they lose not only their sense of humour, but all sense of proportion. This is one reason why many decent-minded people are turned off religion in our society, being so blinded by its exaggerated prejudices that they fail to recognise its many virtues. But the same thing is increasingly true of our attitudes to politics and politicians. It is not, I think, that we have suddenly discovered that our politicians are as venal and compromised as the rest of us. One of the virtues of our democratic system is that we are frequently reminded of that fact. No, it is not the moral fallibility of politicians that troubles us; it is their claim to political infallibility that depresses us. We agree with TS Eliot that \"there is nothing quite conclusive in the art of temporal government\", and we fully understand why that should be so. Politics, after all, is the attempt to find the best way of ordering the unruly wills and affections of disordered humanity, and that is never going to be easy. We know that politics is more an art than a science, so we understand that uncertainty and doubt are intrinsic to its very nature. It is obvious to us now that economics is as cloudy and inexact a subject as parapsychology, which is why we are depressed when we see our politicians hammering out their rival economic certainties on the airwaves without any sense of the absurdities of the exercise. It is not that we want them to be endlessly swithering over what to do, but we do expect them to have the kind of experimental modesty that will acknowledge when something is not working and try something else. Sadly, like bishops, politicians are never allowed to air their doubts in public. Living with uncertainty does not mean that we have to live hesitant and uncommitted lives, either religiously or politically. It does mean that we will live with a certain lightness of being and bring a modest provisionality to our judgments \u2013 especially when we remember how many things we have been wrong about in the past. Artists seem to understand this better than either theologians or politicians. In a letter to his brothers George and Tom, the poet John Keats probably said it best. It should be read daily in their prayers by archbishops and cabinet ministers: \"Negative capability: that is when man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.\" Amen. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "Michael Frayn is momentarily puzzled. He knows there's a reason why he is talking to the Guardian, but he can't quite remember what it is. Is it about the transfer of his uproarious farce Noises Off to the West End? Or the season of his work in Sheffield this month? With two further productions scheduled this spring (Here, and his translation of Uncle Vanya), plus a novel published in May, the 78-year-old writer is astonishingly busy \u2013 but that's not what's causing the confusion. It's the persistent tap-tapping of a long-tailed tit at his study window. We can't sit in there, he says. It's too distracting. Reputation depicts Frayn as a reserved intellectual and, in many ways, the spindly figure who leads me through a book-lined hallway to a spacious, austere sitting room overlooking a huge expanse of lawn, conforms to type. But he also paints himself as a hapless bumbler, at the mercy of life's absurdities. Just the other day he missed the train to Sheffield, forgot to pack the details for his hotel, missed the train back to London, and didn't realise he'd left his bag on the train until he'd walked for 10 minutes to the tube. \"Things are always happening to me where one slight mishap leads to another, which makes me lose some rational sense of the best way to behave,\" he says, cheerfully. No wonder he's such a fan of farce. He has written several for the stage, and Skios, the new novel, represents his first attempt in book form. Not that he can quite define what it means. \"Any time anyone tries to explain what farce is, they fall on their faces,\" he says. \"I suppose there is an element of panic, of people being pressured by circumstances into behaving illogically. When it works, it can be hysterically funny, because the panic of the characters is catching. You get a corporate hysteria in the audience, just as there is a corporate hysteria on stage. Whether you can do that with someone reading a book on their own, I don't know.\" Frayn is reluctant to say anything more about the novel; in fact, despite an air of exquisite geniality, he seems reluctant to be drawn on anything much. He blames \"failing memory, brain cells dying off at a tremendous rate\", although it could be that he just doesn't want to go too deep. In 2010 he published a memoir of his father, written at the instigation of his children, which forced him to re-examine his own difficult childhood. His mother died when he was 12, and he frequently felt he was a disappointment to his cricket-loving, asbestos-salesman father. He didn't realise how unhappy he was, being bullied at an unsympathetic private school, until family finances forced his move to the local grammar. \"I hadn't really thought about those things for years,\" he says now. \"Some of them were quite painful, and thinking about them again was a really disturbing and emotional experience. People say, did you achieve catharsis? Not at all: I was just all stirred up by it.\" The turmoil of his adult life is now firmly in the past: when he fell in love with the biographer Claire Tomalin, he was still a married father of three; the couple have now lived together for 30 years. While he talks, Tomalin is visible through the vast sitting-room windows, pottering about the garden. He says he feels no great impulse to write another memoir. He doesn't rule it out, exactly, but \"I think I'd rather feel I'm writing about somebody else\". Frayn's reputation as a playwright is now so secure it's hard to remember it wasn't ever thus. For every hit, such as Noises Off or Copenhagen, there has been an equally substantial flop, the nadir being 1990's Look Look, which is not included in Frayn's four volumes of collected plays. His very first show, a Footlights review written as a student at Cambridge in the mid-1950s, was received so badly that he went into a sulk with the theatre that lasted several years. While a reporter on the Manchester Guardian, he also reviewed plays: \"I was a terrible critic, very sarcastic and impatient.\" During the 1960s, Frayn established himself as a novelist, most notably with Towards the End of the Morning, his hilarious, touching 1967 book detailing life in the dying days of Fleet Street's newspaper industry. It was an invitation to make a stage version of one of those novels, 1966's The Russian Interpreter, that lured him back to the stage. \"It's very difficult to resist a challenge,\" he says, and his failure to make this particular story work only sharpened his sense of that challenge. \"The restraints on telling a story in the theatre are very intriguing. Because as soon as someone says you can't do something, you immediately start thinking of ways around it. Whereas in a novel it's natural for an author to know what the characters are thinking and feeling, in the theatre you can't do that. Those restrictions are very stimulating to the imagination.\" Plays were to absorb him for a 16-year period, from 1973 to 1989, during which he published no novels. Nothing came easily: his 1984 play Benefactors (part of the Sheffield season) was typical in going through two entire incarnations, one of which was produced and badly reviewed, before reaching its present form. \"It's very painful reading bad reviews,\" he admits, \"but you can learn from them. You can see what's put the reviewer's back up \u2013 and with a play you've got a chance to do another version. I get more enjoyment out of rewriting, I think, than writing the original. The great difficulty is getting from nothing to something; going from something to something else is always easier.\" The other advantage of theatre is the director's input. Frayn credits his long-term collaborator, director Michael Blakemore, with much of the success of the original 1982 production of Noises Off. The pair worked on it together in Blakemore's holiday home in Biarritz, poring over the text in the morning, then spending the afternoons surfing (somehow the thought of Frayn surfing is unimaginable, but he assures me that he did). \"Noises Off would never have worked if Michael hadn't persuaded me to do all kinds of things with the text,\" he says. Writing farce, Frayn says, is the ultimate challenge, \"because you have to keep outbidding yourself. It demands escalation, and it's very difficult to keep in mind where you've got to from one moment to the next.\" His key inspiration for Noises Off was the plays of Georges Feydeau: he suddenly recalls how the first version, a single-act play, was built around a Feydeau pastiche. This prompts a momentary reverie: \"I would quite like to write pastiche Feydeau in French. I've never tried that.\" Frayn says he missed journalism when he stopped writing for the Observer in the 1970s. \"I think I felt more at home in newspapers than in any of the other professions I've had a foothold in.\" (He still believes that fiction-writers should be obliged to work as reporters, \"just to remind them how much more complicated the world is than it seems\"; these real-life complications, and Frayn's appetite for research, have fed into more recent historical plays such as Copenhagen, Democracy and Afterlife.) Will he write another play? Frayn has been announcing his retirement from the theatre on and off for the past decade; a long discussion detailing the different approaches to storytelling required by novel- and playwriting ends with him saying once again, quietly, wistfully: \"And now I've retired from both.\" Does he mean it this time? \"I have no more idea whether I've retired or not than whether it will rain next week.\" It rains the next week. Somehow, be it a novel, play, memoir or Feydeau pastiche, Frayn seems a long way from calling it quits. \u2022 Noises Off transfers to The Novello Theatre from 24 March to 30 June.",

      "bodyText": "The attorney general is examining whether the head of Scotland Yard's investigation into illegal news gathering has prejudiced fair trials for any journalists involved through her evidence to the Leveson inquiry. Dominic Grieve's office is scrutinising the testimony made by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers 10 days ago amid concerns that her comments were potentially in contempt of court. Akers is the head of three linked inquiries into phone hacking, alleged bribes and computer hacking. She said that the Sun newspaper was responsible for creating a \"network of corrupted officials\" and creating a \"culture of illegal payments\" to officials from the police, Ministry of Defence and other public bodies. In a statement about her investigation she included details of \"multiple payments\" by the Sun journalists to public officials, with one individual receiving \u00a380,000, while one journalist, she said, drew more than \u00a3150,000 over the years to pay sources, including public officials. The stories that resulted from these disclosures were \"salacious gossip\", she said, and not in the public interest. She also gave details of how the relative of one arrested public official acted as a conduit to hide the cheque payment to that individual. The Guardian understands the attorney general has received at least one complaint raising concerns that Akers's evidence \u2013 given in the midst of a criminal inquiry \u2013 could be in breach of the Contempt of Court Act and could prejudice further legal action against any of the individuals arrested. Lawyers for the attorney are investigating. A spokeswoman for the attorney general told the Guardian: \"Evidence given during the Leveson inquiry has been drawn to the attention of the attorney general's office. The attorney general will consider the concerns raised.\" Eleven Sun journalists have been arrested in relation to alleged bribes to public officials; all have been named in the media. None have been charged. The attorney general's intervention comes as a former Met commissioner warned that the move to secrecy by Scotland Yard in the wake of the phone hacking scandal threatened to increase the chance of rioting on Britain's streets. Lord Stevens, who ran the Met from 2000-05, told Lord Justice Leveson on Tuesday that the pendulum of police and media relations had swung too far away from openness. Stevens, who as Met commissioner introduced an open door policy for the media, said he would have picked up and \"tirelessly\" pursued the issues raised by the Guardian in 2009 about phone hacking at the News of the World. But he said the reaction to the hacking revelations had created an unhealthy fear of the press among police officers. \"From what I have heard people are absolutely terrified of picking up the phone and speaking to the press in any way,\" he said. \"I don't think that is healthy. The press has their job to do, they have delivered some outstanding work, there has to be a relationship with them for the right reasons.\" He said that not engaging with the press put the police at risk of not being trusted, and in turn risked causing outbreaks of rioting. \"Let me make this clear, in my view this is extremely damaging to British policing,\" he said. \"The media need to know what the police are doing.

This will ultimately result in them being distrusted \u2026 It is precisely in these conditions that public order outbreaks occur as community tensions are heightened and there is public concern over the actions of the police.\" Lord Condon, the Met commissioner from 1993 to 2000, said there should not be an overly bureaucratic response to the phone hacking revelations. \"I would be worried about anything which suggested that any contact between the police and the media was almost inherently wrong, that the media are given some sort of pariah status, and almost being in the same room, or within 50 yards of them, a police officer would be required to take a note,\" he said. But Condon suggested that officers accepting hospitality from journalists was a dangerous area. \"In my opinion hospitality can be the start of a grooming process which can lead to unethical or inappropriate behaviour.\" Both said they favoured no editors during their tenure at the Yard and their relationships with the media during their tenure had always been entirely professional. Stevens, who wrote for the News of the World after retirement from the Met, said he stopped the column after the 2007 convictions of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire over phone hacking. \"I saw Colin Myler and Neil Wallis and told them I didn't want to continue,\" he said. \"I never gave them reasons but from that night on I never saw them again.\" Stevens said his decision to end the contract with the paper \u2013 which latterly was paying him \u00a37,000 an article \u2013 was fuelled by other information he received about \"some unethical behaviour in relation to one or two articles that had got headlines in the News of the World.\" He did not elaborate.",

      "body": "<p>The attorney general is examining whether the head of Scotland Yard's investigation into illegal news gathering has prejudiced fair trials for any journalists involved through her evidence to the Leveson inquiry.</p> <p>Dominic Grieve's office is scrutinising the testimony made by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers 10 days ago amid concerns that her comments were potentially in contempt of court.</p> <p>Akers is the head of three linked inquiries into phone hacking, alleged bribes and computer hacking. She said that the Sun newspaper was responsible for creating a \"network of corrupted officials\" and creating a \"culture of illegal payments\" to officials from the police, Ministry of Defence and other public bodies.</p> <p>In a statement about her investigation she included details of \"multiple payments\" by the Sun journalists to public officials, with one individual receiving \u00a380,000, while one journalist, she said, drew more than \u00a3150,000 over the years to pay sources, including public officials.</p> <p>The stories that resulted from these disclosures were \"salacious gossip\", she said, and not in the public interest. She also gave details of how the relative of one arrested public official acted as a conduit to hide the cheque payment to that individual.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the attorney general has received at least one complaint raising concerns that Akers's evidence \u2013 given in the midst of a criminal inquiry \u2013 could be in breach of the Contempt of Court Act and could prejudice further legal action against any of the individuals arrested. Lawyers for the attorney are investigating.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the attorney general told the Guardian: \"Evidence given during the Leveson inquiry has been drawn to the attention of the attorney general's office. The attorney general will consider the concerns raised.\"</p> <p>Eleven Sun journalists have been arrested in relation to alleged bribes to public officials; all have been named in the media. None have been charged.</p> <p>The attorney general's intervention comes as a former Met commissioner warned that the move to secrecy by Scotland Yard in the wake of the phone hacking scandal threatened to increase the chance of rioting on Britain's streets.</p> <p>Lord Stevens, who ran the Met from 2000-05, told Lord Justice Leveson on Tuesday that the pendulum of police and media relations had swung too far away from openness.</p> <p>Stevens, who as Met commissioner introduced an open door policy for the media, said he would have picked up and \"tirelessly\" pursued the issues raised by the Guardian in 2009 about phone hacking at the News of the World.</p> <p>But he said the reaction to the hacking revelations had created an unhealthy fear of the press among police officers.</p> <p>\"From what I have heard people are absolutely terrified of picking up the phone and speaking to the press in any way,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I don't think that is healthy. The press has their job to do, they have delivered some outstanding work, there has to be a relationship with them for the right reasons.\"</p> <p>He said that not engaging with the press put the police at risk of not being trusted, and in turn risked causing outbreaks of rioting.</p> <p>\"Let me make this clear, in my view this is extremely damaging to British policing,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The media need to know what the police are doing. It is absolutely essential to have transparency and openness \u2026 If there's no engagement then the police risk not being part of the community. This will ultimately result in them being distrusted \u2026 It is precisely in these conditions that public order outbreaks occur as community tensions are heightened and there is public concern over the actions of the police.\"</p> <p>Lord Condon, the Met commissioner from 1993 to 2000, said there should not be an overly bureaucratic response to the phone hacking revelations.</p> <p>\"I would be worried about anything which suggested that any contact between the police and the media was almost inherently wrong, that the media are given some sort of pariah status, and almost being in the same room, or within 50 yards of them, a police officer would be required to take a note,\" he said.</p> <p>But Condon suggested that officers accepting hospitality from journalists was a dangerous area. \"In my opinion hospitality can be the start of a grooming process which can lead to unethical or inappropriate behaviour.\"</p> <p>Both said they favoured no editors during their tenure at the Yard and their relationships with the media during their tenure had always been entirely professional.</p> <p>Stevens, who wrote for the News of the World after retirement from the Met, said he stopped the column after the 2007 convictions of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire over phone hacking.</p> <p>\"I saw Colin Myler and Neil Wallis and told them I didn't want to continue,\" he said. \"I never gave them reasons but from that night on I never saw them again.\"</p> <p>Stevens said his decision to end the contract with the paper \u2013 which latterly was paying him \u00a37,000 an article \u2013 was fuelled by other information he received about \"some unethical behaviour in relation to one or two articles that had got headlines in the News of the World.\" He did not elaborate.</p>",

But at \u00a345m? As stunning as they are, we are not yet short of beauty in our splendid public galleries and grandiose purchases such as this \u2013 at this time \u2013 will give those who consider the arts elitist and irrelevant even more of an excuse to deny their worth. Given the government's statement that all children should have \"the opportunity to experience and take part in performance and visual arts\", some of those at the sharp end of arts education and projects might be forgiven for wondering what opportunities could have been made possible with a share in \u00a345m. Perhaps those holding the big money in the arts might consider taking the time to discuss sharing and caring with colleagues from all artistic areas. We then stand a chance of continuing to provide opportunities for artists of the future to display their beautiful works for the nation to see.<br><strong>Janet Fearnley</strong><br><em>Farnham, Surrey</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee is right to criticise the government for threatening access to justice for the most vulnerable members of society, against which the bar has been campaigning for some time (Yes, legal aid will be cut, but not where it hurts the silks, 6 March). But the focus of her anger is sadly misplaced. It is not the fees of criminal barristers in \"high profile criminal cases\" which have been left \"untouched\". The combination of Labour's cuts in its last term in government and further cuts imposed by the coalition government means fees for murder cases have been slashed by an eyewatering 40%. The real problem is that the taxpayer continues to fund legal aid for criminal cases involving hugely wealthy defendants whose assets have been frozen under restraint orders. Assets under restraint can be released under judicial control to cover defendants' children's private school fees, but not to cover the cost of their lawyers. Cases involving restraint orders are often highly complex, lengthy and costly, disproportionately swallowing a large chunk of the legal aid budget. The Treasury may wish to reserve the funds for later confiscation orders, but such orders are frequently left unpaid, or may not be made in respect of all of the funds restrained. The government must address this scandal, targeting those who can afford to pay their legal fees rather than those who can't, and freeing up funds for more hard-hit areas of the justice budget. Michael Todd QC Chairman of the Bar Council of England and Wales, Max Hill QC Chairman of the Criminal Bar Association \u2022 The abolition of legal aid for social cases will leave the poorest citizens at the mercy of the wide discretion of thousands of jobcentre and local authority officials making decisions about welfare eligibility, sanctions, civil penalties and the enforcement of overpayments. They now have similar powers to magistrates imposing fines and enforcing council tax. It is thus vital that they get their decisions right, otherwise the consequent debts, enforced against the poverty incomes of welfare claimants, will cause misery, ill health and homelessness. Checking whether officials know the Wednesbury principles, which underpin in law their decision-taking, has been depressing. Anecdotal evidence is that some have not heard of the case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation (1947), which set down the standard of unreasonableness of public body decisions that render them liable to be quashed on judicial review. Officials' decisions must take into account all relevant facts, ignore irrelevant facts and be rational. The minister for welfare reform highlighted these principles when debating the welfare reform bill, assuring peers that officials will abide by them; but there will be no quashing of their decisions when solicitors cannot afford to consider whether to challenge in judicial review the legal inconsistencies which happen in new laws or the inevitable errors and inefficiencies.The right of all citizens to challenge over-mighty government is being carelessly undermined by welfare reform. Rev Paul Nicolson Chair, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust \u2022\u2008The scale of the government's welfare reforms make it even more vital that people are able to challenge wrong benefit decisions by government agencies. Yet the legal aid bill \u2013 being debated in the House of Lords today \u2013 will remove all funding for specialist advice on welfare benefit issues. Each year 78,000 disabled people will no longer get help with complex and serious legal problems. Legal aid is at the heart of successful community advice agencies, such as Citizens Advice bureaux and law centres, which either include legal aid within their own provision or refer clients on to nearby solicitors. Without this specialist funding, agencies will struggle to deliver a comprehensive service. Advice on these issues saves the state money as it prevents problems escalating. Citizens Advice estimates it saves the nation \u00a38.80 for every \u00a31 spent. Support for 100,000 people will cost only \u00a316.5m each year. Therefore we urge peers to support the amendment led by Dee Doocey and tabled by peers from all parties to keep the most specialist welfare benefits cases within legal aid.

Most of these girls do not require sanctions and interventions. Resolving behavioural issues quickly and informally would avoid this and would be more effective. For the few who do need intervention, single gender projects have been shown to support girls who are truanting, living in chaotic families or experiencing abuse. These projects boost self-confidence, help resolve problems and can prevent girls from getting caught up in the revolving doors of the penal system. Government, local authorities and the police need to recognise the specific needs of girls so that the criminal justice system does not become a permanent fixture in their lives.

      "bodyText": "On this dewy morning the overgrown valley of Radland millstream echoes with birdsong and the drumming of a woodpecker. Sunlight haloes mosses on sprawling trunks, gilds catkins of hazel and illuminates the delicate white blossom of cherry plum. A stand of narcissus with orange cups and bright yellow petals survives among hart's-tongue fern under the regenerating woodland which casts a tracery of shadows across the adjoining lane, its verges of bluebell leaves and early primrose. Higher up, hedges around pastures are mechanically flailed every year and footings along the narrow ways are worn back by ever wider tractors and dung spreaders. When I was young, farmers coppiced hedge banks for firewood. Linesmen used paring hooks to cut back growth along roadsides, and shovels to cast up the fallen earth. Yet still, these eroded woody banks, entwined with honeysuckle and ivy berries, shelter bluebells, pennyworts and ferns, with primrose and foxglove seeded out in soil stirred up by burrowing rabbits. Dunnocks sing their jingly song and wrens clamour from the shelter of this stunted habitat.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago an academic I know had to suspend her career and go underground for a year. She was fleeing a stalker \u2013 an ex-boyfriend who had spent three years following, messaging and threatening her. She would wake up to dozens of texts and emails telling her the details of how he was going to attack her. He was blocked from her office email but constantly set up new accounts so that his threats would come through. She moved house but he tracked her down. He would wait in a car outside her flat to follow her to work, and outside her work to follow her home. Eventually she gave up and fled the country. She spent a year doing low-paid secretarial jobs. It was the only way that she could be sure that her name wouldn't figure on any staff lists, and that her ex-boyfriend wouldn't be able to find her online. She hoped that if she vanished entirely his malevolent obsession with her would start to wane. This woman was forced into exile because the legal system in the country she was living in, like almost every legal system in the world, was utterly uninterested in recognising or responding to the daily terror that she was being exposed to. The police told her they could only act once she was physically attacked. She could have sought an expensive civil injunction, but to do so she would have had to turn up in court, in full view of the man she was desperately trying to avoid, and give him the tremendous satisfaction of hearing just how effectively he had frightened her and damaged her life. \"That's everything he wants,\" she said. \"To force me to see him, to hear how scared I am and how powerful he is \u2013 that's just what he's trying to achieve.\" She decided not to when her solicitor told her that the police rarely arrested any man who broke such an injunction. It was a waste of time. The official response to stalking in England and Wales has always been just as inadequate. There is no offence of stalking, only of harassment. The Home Office estimates that there are 120,000 cases of stalking every year, almost all of them consisting of men threatening women, and some of them ending in murder, rape and violent assault. On average, women endure a hundred incidents before they even report their cases to police. But they are rarely taken seriously. Sometimes they are told they ought to be pleased at the attention. One woman showed police a series of terrifyingly graphic and obscene threats that she had been sent by a man she scarcely knew; they started laughing and reading them out to one another. Of those 120,000 cases, only 4% resulted in convictions in 2009, with just 735 sentences \u2013 few exceeding six months. Now that may be about to change. An independent parliamentary inquiry, set up last year to look at stalking, and which reported last month, came up with devastating evidence about its prevalence and its effects. A third of those stalked had full-blown post-traumatic stress disorder. Almost 90% of stalkers never had any action taken against them. Stalking was where domestic violence had been 30 years ago \u2013 a huge problem that wasn't taken seriously. There had to be legal change. Stalking needed to be made a specific offence. When Scotland did that in 2010, 150 stalkers were prosecuted in the first four months, and 90% pleaded guilty before trial \u2013 contrasting with just 70 prosecutions over the previous decade. The report was so powerful that David Cameron has decided to act. On Thursday he's expected to announce that stalking will be recognised as a crime for the first time and that serious cases will incur sentences of up to five years. That's to be commended, but campaigners worry that he won't go far enough. Harry Fletcher of the probation union Napo, who helped set up the inquiry, believes the politicians are being stalled by civil servants who are reluctant to do more than fiddle a little with existing law. The team that deals with stalking at the Ministry of Justice has no sense of why action is needed on a wider front, he says, because its members have never talked to a single victim and have no idea of the complexity of the problem. He is worried that changes will be limited to naming stalking as a crime and making it imprisonable: legal redefinitions alone won't do. What campaigners want is the promise of an entire bill dealing with the issue. Police and prosecutors must be trained to deal with stalking, so they act early to stamp on it; victims must be assessed for the risk they face, and given help to guide them through the system; and perpetrators must be given treatment in prison \u2013 which doesn't happen at the moment \u2013 so that they stop. The police need new powers. At present, for instance, they have none to arrest someone who has made threats and may be carrying equipment for kidnapping: rope, balaclavas and chloroform. That should be made an offence, just as going equipped for burglary is now. If the prime minister doesn't come up with a comprehensive solution , then the campaigners have one waiting: a whole series of amendments that they have tabled for debate in the Lords next Monday, and that they will push to a vote if they are dissatisfied with the government's proposals. Stalking's victims have been ignored for too long to be satisfied by an inadequate response now. Twitter: @jennirsl",

      "bodyText": "Cabinet unease over the slow pace of economic recovery burst into the open on Tuesday with the leaking of a letter by business secretary, Vince Cable, in which he warned that the government lacks a \"compelling vision\" beyond tackling Britain's record fiscal deficit. To the irritation of chancellor, George Osborne, who warned that Britain should prepare for an austerity budget on 21 March, the business secretary told the prime minister in his letter that the government cannot rely on markets alone to revive the economy. Contents of the letter, sent to the prime minister and Nick Clegg on 8 February, were first leaked to the FT on 12 February. But the full version of the highly sensitive letter, in which Cable called on No 10 to accept that the Royal Bank of Scotland will have to be broken up, was published on Tuesday afternoon by the BBC. In the most sensitive section, Cable wrote: \"I sense \u2026 that there is still something important missing: a compelling vision of where the country is heading beyond sorting out the fiscal mess; and a clear and confident message abut how we will earn our living in future \u2026 We can be more strategic and the economic backdrop will increase demands that we are ambitious.\" Cable highlighted Lib Dem unease over a central plank of the chancellor's economic strategy \u2013 that the private sector will pick up the slack as the public sector shrinks \u2013 as he warned that there are limits to what markets can achieve. \"Market forces are insufficient for creating the long term industrial capabilities we need. Despite the biggest devaluation since the war, improvement in the UK's trade balance has been disappointing. The Labour boom and bust hollowed out the supply chains on which exporters and inward investors depend. \"And while controversy rages over bankers' bonuses, the much bigger problem is the lack of confidence businesses have in their ability to find affordable financing for future investment. All in all, we must law out a strategic vision for where our future industrial capabilities should lie, and how to deliver it.\" The letter was leaked hours after the business secretary said the Lib Dems were prepared to drop their opposition to scrapping the 50p top rate of tax if a tax on wealth, with a \"mansion tax\" on properties with more than \u00a32m their preferred option. Cable told Radio 4's Today programme: \"If the 50p rate were to go \u2013 and I and my colleagues are not ideologically wedded to the 50p tax rate \u2013 if that were to go, it should be replaced by taxation of wealth, because the wealthy people of the country have got to pay their share, particularly at a time of economic difficulty. How exactly that is configured is a detailed matter for negotiation, but that principle must be upheld, and the mansion tax is actually a very economically sensible way of doing it. But there are different ways of approaching it.\" The intervention by Cable caused some irritation in the Treasury which is bracing itself for a tough round of negotiations before the budget in the \"quad\", the coterie of the cabinet's most senior ministers. This group comprises of the prime minister, the chancellor, the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander, Osborne's number two at the Treasury. Osborne is more open to the idea of a tax on wealth than the prime minister who is highly suspicious of increasing tax on property. The chancellor believes that the best bet is close down loopholes on stamp duty which allow millionaires to register new properties in the name of overseas companies. This means they pay 0.5% in stamp duty on properties worth more than \u00a31m rather than the standard 5%. Osborne warned on Tuesday that there would be no \"unfunded giveaways\" in the budget. In a speech to the annual dinner of the EEF manufacturers' organisation, he said: \"By facing difficult decisions head on, we have won the credibility which will allow us to constrain inflationary pressure, support long term low interest rates and provided the stability that creates the space for private sector investment. I have a budget in two weeks' time, I can tell you: we are not going to put that credibility and stability and low interest rates at risk. \"The days of unfunded giveaways are over \u2013 and they're not coming back in this budget. Everything has to be paid for.\" Osborne risked a row with his coalition partners by calling on Britain's industrialists to campaign in favour of one of the recommendations in the controversial Beecroft report on employment law. The venture capitalist argued in his report, commissioned by the Downing Street policy guru Steve Hilton, in favour of \"compensated no fault-dismissal\" for small businesses. The Lib Dems, who were wary of the Beecroft report, agreed to a consultation. Osborne said: \"Plenty of trade unions and others will be submitting their evidence for why we shouldn't do this. If you think we should, and it will increase employment, then don't wait for someone else to send in the evidence. Send it in yourself.\" The negotiations on the budget, in which the Treasury is expected to meet its forecast for a \u00a3127bn deficit in 2011-12 with a few billion pounds to spare, have highlighted divisions between the coalition partners and among the Tories.",

But the full version of the highly sensitive letter, in which Cable called on No 10 to accept that the Royal Bank of Scotland will have to be broken up, was published on Tuesday afternoon by the BBC.</p> <p>In the most sensitive section, Cable wrote: \"I sense \u2026 that there is still something important missing: a compelling vision of where the country is heading beyond sorting out the fiscal mess; and a clear and confident message abut how we will earn our living in future \u2026 We can be more strategic and the economic backdrop will increase demands that we are ambitious.\"</p> <p>Cable highlighted Lib Dem unease over a central plank of the chancellor's economic strategy \u2013 that the private sector will pick up the slack as the public sector shrinks \u2013 as he warned that there are limits to what markets can achieve. \"Market forces are insufficient for creating the long term industrial capabilities we need. Despite the biggest devaluation since the war, improvement in the UK's trade balance has been disappointing. The Labour boom and bust hollowed out the supply chains on which exporters and inward investors depend.</p> <p>\"And while controversy rages over bankers' bonuses, the much bigger problem is the lack of confidence businesses have in their ability to find affordable financing for future investment. All in all, we must law out a strategic vision for where our future industrial capabilities should lie, and how to deliver it.\"</p> <p>The letter was leaked hours after the business secretary said the Lib Dems were prepared to drop their opposition to scrapping the 50p top rate of tax if a tax on wealth, with a \"mansion tax\" on properties with more than \u00a32m their preferred option. Cable told Radio 4's Today programme: \"If the 50p rate were to go \u2013 and I and my colleagues are not ideologically wedded to the 50p tax rate \u2013 if that were to go, it should be replaced by taxation of wealth, because the wealthy people of the country have got to pay their share, particularly at a time of economic difficulty. How exactly that is configured is a detailed matter for negotiation, but that principle must be upheld, and the mansion tax is actually a very economically sensible way of doing it. But there are different ways of approaching it.\"</p> <p>The intervention by Cable caused some irritation in the Treasury which is bracing itself for a tough round of negotiations before the budget in the \"quad\", the coterie of the cabinet's most senior ministers. This group comprises of the prime minister, the chancellor, the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander, Osborne's number two at the Treasury.</p> <p>Osborne is more open to the idea of a tax on wealth than the prime minister who is highly suspicious of increasing tax on property. The chancellor believes that the best bet is close down loopholes on stamp duty which allow millionaires to register new properties in the name of overseas companies. This means they pay 0.5% in stamp duty on properties worth more than \u00a31m rather than the standard 5%.</p> <p>Osborne warned on Tuesday that there would be no \"unfunded giveaways\" in the budget.</p> <p>In a speech to the annual dinner of the EEF manufacturers' organisation, he said: \"By facing difficult decisions head on, we have won the credibility which will allow us to constrain inflationary pressure, support long term low interest rates and provided the stability that creates the space for private sector investment. I have a budget in two weeks' time, I can tell you: we are not going to put that credibility and stability and low interest rates at risk.</p> <p>\"The days of unfunded giveaways are over \u2013 and they're not coming back in this budget. Everything has to be paid for.\"</p> <p>Osborne risked a row with his coalition partners by calling on Britain's industrialists to campaign in favour of one of the recommendations in the controversial Beecroft report on employment law.</p> <p>The venture capitalist argued in his report, commissioned by the Downing Street policy guru Steve Hilton, in favour of \"compensated no fault-dismissal\" for small businesses. The Lib Dems, who were wary of the Beecroft report, agreed to a consultation.</p> <p>Osborne said: \"Plenty of trade unions and others will be submitting their evidence for why we shouldn't do this. If you think we should, and it will increase employment, then don't wait for someone else to send in the evidence. Send it in yourself.\"</p> <p>The negotiations on the budget, in which the Treasury is expected to meet its forecast for a \u00a3127bn deficit in 2011-12 with a few billion pounds to spare, have highlighted divisions between the coalition partners and among the Tories.</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has warned that Iran is seeking to build an inter-continental missile that would threaten the west, as he urged Israel to allow time for sanctions to force the Iranians to change their strategic stance. He was speaking after the cabinet was briefed for an hour by the national security adviser, Sir Kim Darroch, on the imminence of the threat to the UK posed by Iran. It is the first time Cameron has made such an explicit warning that Iran could endanger UK security, and has faint echoes of the warnings from Tony Blair's government that Iraq could fire weapons of mass destruction with 45 minutes' notice. It is understood that the government's National Security Council is also looking at potential reprisals in the UK if Israel were to launch a pre-emptive strike against an Iranian nuclear site. Critics accuse Iran of planning to use its enrichment of uranium for weapons. Cameron will be briefed by President Barack Obama next week on the US approach to any such strike when the two leaders meet in Washington. Speaking to MPs on the Commons liaison committee, the prime minister said Tehran's ambitions were dangerous for the Middle East. But Cameron also added that Iran \"is a danger more broadly, not least because there are signs that the Iranians want to have some sort of inter-continental missile capability. \"We have to be clear this is a threat potentially much wider than just Israel and the region.\" The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told an American Jewish group in Washington on Monday that diplomacy and sanctions had failed and that \"none of us can afford to wait much longer\" to act against Tehran. On Tuesday six global powers agreed to resume negotiations with Iran on its nuclear programme, calling for \"concrete and practical steps\" to restore international trust in Tehran's stated intentions. In a letter to Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, the EU foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton, said the negotiations should restart as soon as possible, at a venue to be decided. Writing on behalf of a negotiating group comprising the US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany, Ashton said: \"Our overall goal remains a comprehensive negotiated long-term solution which restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme, while respecting Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy consistent with the NPT [nuclear non-proliferation treaty].\" The last set of talks broke down in Istanbul in January last year. Western diplomats said Jalili refused at that meeting to negotiate over Iran's nuclear programme or any confidence-building measures previously discussed, such as an exchange of Iranian enriched uranium for foreign-made fuel rods for the Tehran research reactor. At the meeting, the Iranian negotiator laid down preconditions for talks including the lifting of all sanctions and a guarantee that Iran could continue its nuclear programme, including the most controversial element, uranium enrichment. Tehran says the programme is for purely peaceful purposes, but the west and Israel allege it is a front for an effort to build a nuclear arsenal, or at least establish the capacity to build a bomb at short notice. Jalili's reply to Ashton was delivered in February, four months after her proposal, suggesting talks on \"a spectrum of issues\" including \"Iran's nuclear issue\". French officials argued that in order to satisfy Israel that all was being done to resolve the nuclear crisis by peaceful means, the international response would have to make it absolutely clear that the talks would have to end with the \"full implementation\" of UN security council resolutions calling for the suspension of uranium enrichment. That language was spelt out in Ashton's latest letter. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), presented to the agency's board this week, said Iran had tripled its rate of production of 20%-enriched uranium \u2013 seen by the west as a particular proliferation threat \u2013 and reported that Iran had not co-operated with an inspection visit last month, refusing access to a sensitive military site known as Parchin. Iran is thought to have already developed a ballistic missile which can travel approximately 1,200 miles. The International Atomic Energy Agency has asked Iran to explain evidence that it once worked on a missile payload design that could be used to deliver a nuclear warhead. There is evidence that the Iranians and North Koreans cooperated in the past on missile technology. However, there is no proof of North Korean involvement in any payload design, nor is there conclusive proof that Iran itself has pursued the development of such a weapon. Cameron stressed that Iran should not be seen as \"a mini superpower\" but as \"a disastrous country\" with mass unemployment and a dysfunctional economy. He said he still believed the track of sanctions should be pursued, arguing EU-wide sanctions were causing dislocation to the Iranian foreign exchange position and \"should not be sniffed at\". He said the next step was to get the Indians and Chinese to also refuse to buy Iranian oil. \"The more pressure we pile on Iran through sanctions the more incentive they have to take a different path \u2013 it is the best option we have\". The prime minister said that no plans were being laid at this stage to increase the UK military presence in the region. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 adn 12 March 2012 because quotes attributed to David Cameron went farther than his words as spoken. Headings said, Iran 'seeking to build nuclear weapon', warns David Cameron; and Prime minister says Iran is planning an 'inter-continental nuclear weapon'. Story text said, David Cameron has warned that Iran is seeking to build an 'inter-continental nuclear weapon' that threatens the west. These have been corrected to conform with his remark about an intercontinental missile capability quoted elsewhere in the story. An assertion that Iran is working with North Korea to turn an existing Iranian missile into one that can accommodate a nuclear warhead has been replaced by a more detailed account. Finally, the original article mentioned possibility of a pre-emptive strike against an Iranian \"nuclear weapons site\". This has been changed to nuclear site.",

      "bodyText": "George Lucas may have thought up the Star Wars series, but it would have looked very different without the imaginative breadth of the conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie, who has died aged 82. McQuarrie's style was characterised by competing strains of industrial realism and aesthetic grandeur. \"I've always had sort of a dreamworld approach to sitting and sketching for myself,\" he said. \"I go for the romantic and what looks interesting while half my mind is occupied with practicality.\" Nowhere was this more apparent than in his design of Darth Vader, the terrifying Dark Lord from the Star Wars films. \"The first thing I thought was, 'Shouldn't he have some sort of breathing apparatus if he's entering the vacuum of space?' I asked George and he said, 'Fine, give him a breath mask.'\" A movie legend was born, along with millions of childhood nightmares. In the eight years it took to make the first Star Wars trilogy, various artists translated Lucas's ideas into sketches and paintings. However, McQuarrie was there from the beginning. Recruited by the filmmaker in 1975, he originated or modified the look of many of the movies' key characters, including the Yeti-like \"Wookiee\" Chewbacca and the androids R2-D2 and C-3PO, and worked on sets and matte paintings for the trilogy. McQuarrie also designed spacecraft for Steven Spielberg on Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and E.T. \u2013 The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), as well as the aliens in Cocoon (1985). He was part of the four-strong team that won an Academy award for its visual-effects work on the latter movie. McQuarrie was born in Gary, Indiana, and raised on a farm in Montana. His family then moved to the west coast and on to Vancouver, Canada, where he enrolled at a technical school. While serving in the military during the Korean war, he survived a bullet to the head. Returning to the US, he studied at California's Art Centre College of Design and then took a series of design-oriented jobs. He illustrated books, drew teeth and instruments for a dental firm, prepared aerodynamic illustrations for Boeing, storyboarded educational films and provided animated segments for CBS News. Two up-and-coming filmmakers, Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood, hired him to contribute designs for their science-fiction script Star Dancing. Although the project was never made, his designs were seen by Lucas, who was then nurturing an idea for a science-fiction adventure movie. \"Darth, R2-D2 and all of that came out of those first three or four weeks in early 1975,\" said McQuarrie. \"George gave me a script and I went away for a while. He said, 'Do what interests you.' It was like hearing music and seeing what you hear.\" Released in 1977, Star Wars broke box-office records and changed cinema forever, for both good and ill. McQuarrie's designs, functional but often beautiful, were central to the film's character, and led to other offers within the science-fiction genre, including the television series Battlestar Galactica (which he worked on until the show's overlap with the Star Wars universe became too pronounced). When Spielberg asked him to design the mothership for the climax of Close Encounters, the artist drew on a dream from years earlier, in which he had seen an awe-inspiring spacecraft with pipes and stairways jutting out from its underside. Spielberg turned that concept on its head, so that the protuberances were now crowded onto the top of the ship like a tightly-packed metropolis. McQuarrie often relied on the unconscious part of his mind to generate inspiration. \"I used to try squeezing work out, but it's like toothpaste in a tube that will only come out so fast \u2026 There's no point pounding my brain \u2013 the best thing I can do is collect my thoughts as soon as I'm told what's needed. Then I lie down and let it gel unconsciously. I sort of semi-sleep, and somewhere along the way of going to sleep or coming out of it, I get exactly what I need \u2013 it's just there, rising like the bubbles in champagne from somewhere inside.\" On the second and finest Star Wars picture, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), McQuarrie's responsibilities were greatly increased. Most of the movie's new elements (including a frozen planet called Hoth and a city floating in the clouds) bore his imprint; Lucas even named a minor character after him. But fewer of his ideas made the cut in Return of the Jedi (1983), and he seemed to be experiencing some fatigue. \"It became less fun as time went on. I had done the best part already and I was just rehashing everything. I kept meeting myself in my thinking. It became more and more difficult to keep my enthusiasm up.\" McQuarrie worked on a handful of subsequent films including Cocoon, *batteries not included (directed in 1987 by Robbins, his friend from the days of Star Dancing), Nightbreed (1990) and Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993). He also designed covers for short-story collections by Isaac Asimov, and collaborated with Douglas Trumbull on the Back to the Future ride at the Universal Studios theme park. About the series that made his reputation, he was unambiguously positive. \"It's really a nice feeling to go down the street and see, on the sidewalk, a bubblegum wrapper with Darth Vader's picture on it. And Darth's face on the cover of Time, too. It's interesting to have done something out in the world that everyone looks at all the time. You become part of the public happening.\" He is survived by his wife, Joan. \u2022 Ralph McQuarrie, artist, born 13 June 1929; died 3 March 2012 \u2022 The Art of Ralph McQuarrie website",

But fewer of his ideas made the cut in Return of the Jedi (1983), and he seemed to be experiencing some fatigue. \"It became less fun as time went on. I had done the best part already and I was just rehashing everything. I kept meeting myself in my thinking. It became more and more difficult to keep my enthusiasm up.\"</p> <p>McQuarrie worked on a handful of subsequent films including Cocoon, *batteries not included (directed in 1987 by Robbins, his friend from the days of Star Dancing), Nightbreed (1990) and Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993). He also designed covers for short-story collections by Isaac Asimov, and collaborated with Douglas Trumbull on the Back to the Future ride at the Universal Studios theme park.</p> <p>About the series that made his reputation, he was unambiguously positive. \"It's really a nice feeling to go down the street and see, on the sidewalk, a bubblegum wrapper with Darth Vader's picture on it. And Darth's face on the cover of Time, too. It's interesting to have done something out in the world that everyone looks at all the time. You become part of the public happening.\"</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Joan.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Ralph McQuarrie, artist, born 13 June 1929; died 3 March 2012</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.ralphmcquarrie.com\" title=\"Picture galleries at www.ralphmcquarrie.com\">The Art of Ralph McQuarrie website</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Last year this venturesome venue gave us a riveting portrait of Belfast's Protestant culture in St John Ervine's Mixed Marriage (1911). Now it crosses the border to show us Catholic passions in rural Cork in a rare revival of a 1924 work by TC Murray, who became a pillar of Dublin's Abbey Theatre. What strikes me is that tragedy, at the very time it was expiring in England, was flourishing across the Irish sea. Murray makes no bones about his tragic intentions: his play is clearly intended as an Irish variation on the classical story of Phaedra. His hero, Owen Keegan, is a boisterous, widowed farmer who, to the dismay of his grown-up daughter and son, marries a girl half his age. When Owen is bed-bound after a riding accent, the growing passion between his wife and son bursts into uncontrollable life. The problem is that Murray, writing as a devout Catholic and former headmaster, cannot disguise his innate moralism: his play almost reads like a lecture on the folly of May-to-December marriages. But Murray also has the Irish dramatist's gift for the vividly unexpected phrase: at one point, the pent-up Owen describes the frustration of \"hearing the cows gadding about in the heat\". And, as one of the so-called \"Cork realists\", Murray had a deep understanding of rural frustration. Indeed the most tragic character in the play is Owen's daughter, Ellen, who is described as \"a young woman having no youth\" and who seems doomed to a life of farmhouse drudgery. The role is also exquisitely played, in Veronica Quilligan's sensitive revival, by Aoife McMahon, who suggests a buried emotional longing that has never found fulfilment. Luke Hayden as the larger-than-life Owen and Valene Kane as the sprightly, soft-spoken girl he marries also give fine performances in a revealing revival. It's intriguing to think that, while Dublin was relishing Autumn Fire, London was first enjoying Hay Fever: two plays, two different worlds.",

Next week \u2013 on 11 March, if you're planning a party \u2013 it will be precisely two decades since the first email with an attachment was sent, rescuing email from its academic niche and sending it out into the big wide world, like the young Orca Willy, liberated from the amusement park hell and set free to make backflips in the sea (until it's time for the sequel). Maybe you are thinking, Why write this celebratory column now when it would surely make more sense to do it next week? Ah, but we live in an internet age now, in which news is supposed to break at least a week before the event itself happens. Get with the programme, grandad! So congratulations, email; in one more year you can legally get drunk in the US and then send late-night misguided missives to your ex-lovers on your own medium, and then suffer meta remorse. But as one matures, one's parents cease to treat one like a child. This at times shocking development (\"Wait, you expect me to do my own washing when I stay at yours for Christmas? MY OWN WASHING?\") often manifests itself in them not praising absolutely every little thing you do. Once a simple finger painting was viewed as proof that you were \"very advanced, developmentally \u2013 should we put her down early for an MA at the Courtauld, do you think?\" Now it's: \"Horizontal stripes? On your hips, honey? Are you sure?\" So it has proven for poor little email. On Monday, Nathaniel Borenstein, the frequently dubbed \"father of email\", said at a conference that, actually, he is disappointed in his child prodigy. Something about its cumbersome code, which makes his kid look bit of a chubster, or it clutters up the internet, which is basically the same thing in parenting terms. This code, according to Daddy Dearest Borenstein, was supposed to have changed as email evolved but instead has remained locked in the internet and this has caused Borenstein paroxysms of guilt. Well, Mr Borenstein, suffer no more. If you think a pesky code is the worst retort to the initial optimism we all had about the internet, you clearly have never been on dailymail.co.uk. My God, in the eyes of some of us, or possibly just one of us, the internet is nothing but one hot, bubbling sea of disappointment and human failure. So to slake Mr Borenstein's nights of insomnia, here are the worst things about the internet, all of which make a pudgy code look like a downright blessing: 1. Twitter feuds Just edging past retweeting of compliments, detailing your lunch in your Facebook status update, the concept of quantifying your friends as if they were currency and getting LinkedIn requests from the jerk who used to bully you at school, Twitter feuds are the worst of the detritus trailed by social media. Hearing about other people's petty quarrels is dull enough; having to watch them conducted on Twitter between the likes of Miley Cyrus and her ex-boyfriend makes one doubt Darwinism: \"I can't change you're [sic] mind \u2026 Maybe YOU'RE the one pretending you're fine,\" scribes the Achy-Breaky fille. Oh, Dorothy Parker \u2013 whither thou now? 2. The black hole of dailymail.co.uk's righthand column Look, I'm a journalist, ergo I'm very much on Team Journalism. Yay! So, fine, let the Daily Mail exist in all its fetid form. But not even an empty box of Krispy Kremes can cause as much self-loathing and act as a testament to the addictive nature of the product within as the righthand column of celebrity photos on the Daily Mail's home page. I look at that website more times a day than I go to the loo (forgive me, merciful God!) and I didn't even realise there were other stories on it besides those photos until about a month ago. What does Imogen Thomas wear to the gym? Why can someone called Lauren Goodger not stop eating? And how does Ice-T's wife maintain those curves? These are questions I have never asked myself and yet I seek their answers as soon as I am on the Daily Mail's website and the hours slip away. But what I lose in time, I gain in knowledge. Um, right. 3. Bankruptcy Wait a minute, I'll get to you as soon as I've bought this dress on theoutnet.com. And then done my Ocado order. Oh! And I meant to order those things off Amazon yonks ago! Here's the thing about spending money on the internet: it doesn't feel like you're spending money, and don't even get me started on the devilish taunt of websites asking if you want them to \"save your payment details.\" Damn you, netaporter.com! So if Borenstein really wants to improve an internet algorithm (oh yeah \u2013 I saw The Social Network), when you buy something over the internet, you should physically have to insert the money into the screen, one note at a time. It's the only thing standing between me, bankruptcy and death caused by drowning in my own flat beneath a sea of netaporter.com shopping bags.",

      "bodyText": "I saw Elizabeth Windsor's face every day when I was a small child. She was at the post office, in the newsagent, and there waiting for me on my first day at infants' school, on the wall, behind the teacher's desk. I had one of those splenetic teachers, Mrs Ralph, whom I occasionally see in my dreams. When Mrs Ralph was stalking the rows of desks, searching for a child to bring to tears, I would stare at Elizabeth's picture: she was in profile, wearing a small jewelled crown and dark red lipstick. She looked like my mother, Grace, as she emerged from her tiny bedroom after transforming herself with Max Factor and the scent of Evening in Paris. Like Elizabeth's showbiz sister, Margaret Rose, Grace used a silver cigarette case. Elizabeth was there, watching, when Mr Luker, our angry, red-faced headmaster, shouted at us pasty-faced English children as we struggled to sing \"De Camptown Racetrack five miles long \u2013 Oh! doo-dah day\", with an authentic southern accent and the same guileless joy of what he called \"the piccaninnies\". She was there watching, hanging from the tongue-and-groove wall of the eau-de-nil assembly hall. On Coronation Day I had excitedly carried a wobbling green jelly in a cut-glass dish from a neighbour's prefab to our own, because, amazingly, a television the size of a Punch and Judy tent had been installed in the corner of our living room. Richard Dimbleby told us in hushed tones that the St Edward's Crown was very heavy, at 4lb 12oz. When the time came for the archbishop to place the weighty crown on Elizabeth's delicate head, I swear nobody watching or listening took a breath until it was finally settled, and the shout of \"God save the Queen!\" rang out. I was doubly relieved because I had been worrying that the weight would snap her neck. I did not know then that Elizabeth Windsor was a figurehead. In my childish ignorance I thought she was in charge of England, and that she wore her crown after breakfasting on gold plates, and only took it off before she climbed into her fairytale-like bed at night. There was a brass plaque with a relief of her head and shoulders hanging from a nail on the living-room wall of our prefab. It was one of my jobs to polish the brasses on Saturday mornings. I would use a wad of Brasso to clean her; then, when the residue was dry, I'd buff her up. I had difficulty getting inside her Hanoverian nostrils with a duster, but a Swan Vesta matchstick helped. When the coal fire was glowing in half-light, Elizabeth shone like a golden goddess. Then came the great catastrophe: when I discovered that God had allowed Jesus to be nailed to a cross, even though Jesus had shouted \"My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?\", and I stopped believing in Him, Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and her \u2013 Mrs Windsor, a person called the Queen. I kept my loss of faith to myself. The royal family were the popular celebrities of the day. Criticism of the monarchy was unthinkable. We are told by the royal press office that the monarchy is good for tourism, but only one venue makes it to the top 20: Windsor Castle, at 17. It is easily beaten by Windsor Legoland, at number seven. Although Elizabeth must have been party to choosing a wife for Charles, she never truly approved of Diana. Her Jeremy Kyle Show confessional-style neurosis was anathema to the Queen, whose own youthful neurosis was quiet and unshowy \u2013 waking up in the night and getting out of bed to straighten and re-straighten her shoes. Sadly, our monarchical state has had a disastrous effect on her family. Perhaps it is time for Elizabeth Windsor to have her big jubilee party, tap her feet to Sir Cliff, Sir Paul and Sir Elton, and then, after thanking Gary Barlow, steal away quietly. We'll give her houses, land, dogs and horses. She may even enjoy living in the Falklands; it's like Scotland. She will have to go soon, because one day we will choose our own figurehead; and when he or she is elected there will be ceremonial splendour, brass bands, red tunics, flags, lasers and fireworks. There will be life after the monarchy's death. We have grown up now, and we no longer need her.

Richard Dimbleby told us in hushed tones that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Edward%27s_Crown\" title=\"\">St Edward's Crown</a> was very heavy, at 4lb 12oz. When the time came for the archbishop to place the weighty crown on Elizabeth's delicate head, I swear nobody watching or listening took a breath until it was finally settled, and the shout of \"God save the Queen!\" rang out. I was doubly relieved because I had been worrying that the weight would snap her neck.</p> <p>I did not know then that Elizabeth Windsor was a figurehead. In my childish ignorance I thought she was in charge of England, and that she wore her crown after breakfasting on gold plates, and only took it off before she climbed into her fairytale-like bed at night.</p> <p>There was a brass plaque with a relief of her head and shoulders hanging from a nail on the living-room wall of our prefab. It was one of my jobs to polish the brasses on Saturday mornings. I would use a wad of Brasso to clean her; then, when the residue was dry, I'd buff her up. I had difficulty getting inside her Hanoverian nostrils with a duster, but a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBL71A3XRc0\" title=\"\">Swan Vesta</a> matchstick helped. When the coal fire was glowing in half-light, Elizabeth shone like a golden goddess.</p> <p>Then came the great catastrophe: when I discovered that God had allowed Jesus to be nailed to a cross, even though Jesus had shouted <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+27%3A45-50&amp;version=KJV\" title=\"\">\"My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?\"</a>, and I stopped believing in Him, Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and her \u2013 Mrs Windsor, a person called the Queen. I kept my loss of faith to myself. The royal family were the popular celebrities of the day. Criticism of the monarchy was unthinkable.</p> <p>We are told by the royal press office&#xa0;that the monarchy is good for tourism, but only one venue makes it&#xa0;to&#xa0;the top&#xa0;20: Windsor Castle, at 17. It&#xa0;is easily&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/Tourism/index.php\" title=\"\">beaten by Windsor Legoland, at number seven</a>.</p> <p>Although Elizabeth must have been party to choosing a wife for Charles, she never truly approved of Diana. Her <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/jeremykyle/\" title=\"\">Jeremy Kyle Show</a> confessional-style neurosis was anathema to the Queen, whose own youthful neurosis was quiet and unshowy \u2013 waking up in the night and getting out of bed to straighten and re-straighten her shoes. Sadly, our monarchical state has had a disastrous effect on her family.</p> <p>Perhaps it is time for Elizabeth Windsor to have her big jubilee party, tap her feet to Sir Cliff, Sir Paul and Sir Elton, and then, after thanking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/07/queen-diamond-jubilee-concert-lineup\" title=\"\">Gary Barlow</a>, steal away quietly. We'll give her houses, land, dogs and horses. She may even enjoy living in the Falklands; it's like Scotland. She will have to go soon, because one day we will choose our own figurehead; and when he or she is elected there will be ceremonial splendour, brass bands, red tunics, flags, lasers and fireworks. There will be life after the monarchy's death. We have grown up now, and we no longer need her.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780718157159\">Buy Sue Townsend's new book The Woman Who Went to Bed for a Year, from the Guardian bookshop </a></p> <p>Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Government inaction over obesity is \"killing\" Britons, Jamie Oliver has claimed in a strongly worded new assault on the coalition's public health policies. Referring to the government's approach to the growing obesity crisis, the chef and food campaigner went further than his previous criticism of health secretary Andrew Lansley and education secretary Michael Gove, whom Oliver has accused of watering down policies designed to ensure school food is healthy. \"We are lacking real leadership in Britain, sadly, and it's killing us \u2013 literally. That whole government \u2013 they lack any imagination,\" he said in Australia, where he was launching an addition to his network of Ministry of Food centres. \"They haven't done anything that will even touch what's been announced today.\" In October he provoked Lansley's ire by condemning his new \"national ambition\" to tackle obesity as \"worthless, regurgitated, patronising rubbish\". The lack of government action in it represented \"a complete cop-out\", he said. The Department of Health responded by maintaining that it intended to reduce obesity and save lives. \"We have strong plans to reduce levels of obesity by 2020. These include giving councils a ring-fenced budget for public health, working with industry to show people how many calories are in the foods they eat and working with business on plans to help people eat fewer calories. There are encouraging signs that the level of obesity among children as a whole is stabilising\", said a spokeswoman. Food campaigners backed Oliver, however. \"Mr Oliver is absolutely right\", said Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum and founder of the Child Growth Foundation. \"The Labour government had the grace to listen when he made the case in 2005 to feed pupils with healthy food. But the current government has not. When it was told by its own obesity advisers the measures it should continue with to make our children healthy, it not only didn't listen but it fired the advisers.\" A diet of substandard food will lead to health problems, with some young people becoming obese then predeceasing their parents, Fry said. he criticised the coalition's reliance on the so-called \"responsibility deal\", which lets food firms avoid regulation in return for voluntary action to improve their products and make it easier for consumers to eat fewer calories. Malcolm Clark, co-ordinator of the Children's Food Campaign, which is backed by health, education and children's charities, said: \"It's a shame that Jamie isn't our health secretary \u2013 he wouldn't share the government's fear of taking the steps needed to tackle the nation's obesity crisis and poor dietary habits. \"Instead of robust action to protect our health, the government gives us weak, industry-friendly policies which have little chance of changing people's long-term behaviour. Austere times is not an acceptable reason for lacking an effective public health strategy.\"",

      "bodyText": "Farewell \"Mad Dog\", hello \"Mr Nice Guy\": nobody can accuse the wise men of Twickenham of being prescriptive about the tone of the captaincy of the national team. And, if they choose to confirm Chris Robshaw as Lewis Moody's long-term successor after this Six Nations tournament alongside his equally new coach, Stuart Lancaster, who is vying to be the full-time heir to Martin Johnson, they really will have put the fading turbulent past behind them. In the week England's last appointed \u2013 and, ultimately, lost \u2013 leader announced his departure from rugby after 16 mostly glorious years, Robshaw, a blond of an altogether different demeanour, declared himself content in the job but way short of being complacent after only three full internationals. At 25, the Harlequins captain is eight years younger than Moody, and looks it. There is no gnarl about him yet, but it will come, most likely in further increments against France in Paris on Sunday. Robshaw does not mind the stereotyping of him as \"fluffy\", a Surrey public schoolboy with rosy cheeks and excellent manners, but he almost blushes when reminded that one profiler said he could find nobody to say a bad word about him. Team-mates at Quins respect him as they would an older brother, while reserving the right to take the mickey out of him, as they did when he was required to tell a joke at a public function. \"It was a pretty bad joke, too,\" he says, as we look out of a rain-lashed window at his first club, Warlingham RFC, where he has come to spread the gospel on behalf of RBS Rugby Force, a grassroots programme that improves club facilities. \"It's great to come down here and coach,\" he says. \"I haven't been back here in maybe 10 or 15 years. Got a trophy still in my room from the Under-8s.\" So, how does it feel to be elevated to the highest job in his sport in such a hurricane fashion? \"Pretty surreal, to be honest,\" he says. \"I was in the leadership group and they weren't sure who was going to be captain. The following week Stuart called me into his office and said, 'I'd like you to be captain'. He said I couldn't tell anyone for half an hour but I left the room with this massive smile on my face. To run out at Twickenham and sing the national anthem in front of 80,000 people singing alongside you \u2026 That's the sort of thing you imagine as a kid. You dream about it. Incredible.\" What is also incredible is that, before he led the team on to the pitch against Wales two weeks ago, Robshaw had seen the Six Nations at Twickenham only on TV. \"It's true. I went to an autumn international once, against South Africa I think, for an 18th birthday present. Charlie Hodgson did a cross kick to Mark Cueto, who scored in the corner. Charlie scored as well. I reminded Charlie of that the other day.\" It has not been all smiles. Robshaw says his game suffered when he was first appointed as he was \"too worried about external things\". Nick Easter calmed his nerves when he told him: \"Relax, we're here to help.\" Robshaw also had the baggage of missing out on the World Cup (and he would not agree that it may have been a blessing in disguise). \"To play well all season and get that tap on the shoulder from Martin Johnson saying, 'You're not going', that was pretty devastating, really. Of course you have your dark moments and you mope about a bit but you have to get back on your horse.\" He did it with the gusto of Tonto riding into town with the Lone Ranger after being beaten up by the baddies yet again. \"I've been in contact with Stuart for quite a while now, with Saxons and with England. He's a great guy, very positive. He's very similar to Conor O'Shea [the Quins director of rugby] in that respect. He's switched on, great to have at the helm. He's done a tremendous job. We want to go out there and play for him. \"He's done what he said he's going to do: give players an opportunity. I'd like think we've repaid him, although there are two massive games left, against France and Ireland.\" So, is there a sense that this is a grand adventure between coach, captain and young team? \"Definitely. I think we've only been together 30, 35 days. Within that squad you've got guys who have never played before, and also guys who have played 30, 40 times, but it's generally quite a young group. We want to go places. We want to play against the best players in the world. We want to be there 39, 40 games from now, at the next World Cup.\" Away from work, Robshaw is a \"very fair-weather golfer\", likes to sit at home \"playing silly board games\" with his girlfriend, watches TV and even cooks. \"I did have a guitar,\" he admits, \"but very dusty\" \u2013 the epitome of Modern Rugby Man. While life looks sunny for the young England captain, realists will wait before anointing the new partnership. Success means more when ripe, however, and freshness is what Robshaw and Lancaster bring to the England project. Plus \u00e7a change, as the French say? Not always.

      "bodyText": "Liberal Democrats have objected to nearly one in three of the new constituencies proposed in a major shakeup of how MPs are elected \u2013 keeping alive the prospect of a rebellion by the coalition partners against the changes. In the most strongly worded objections, from the West Midlands region, party members describe the Boundary Commission for England proposals as \"schizophrenic, unnecessary and haphazard\". The Lib Dem response is revealed among 25,000 documents released on Tuesday onto the Boundary Commission website as part of their ongoing review, designed to reduce the number of English MPs from 533 to 502. Across the UK, the electoral map is being redrawn to consolidate 650 constituencies to 600, all with a roughly equal number of voters, plans which are due to be finalised later this year and voted on by both houses of parliament in 2013, before the next general election. There are conflicting reports about how great the impact will be on different parties, though many suggest the Lib Dems would lose a disproportionate level of their current 57 MPs. One analysis by Lewis Baston and Kevin Larkin for the Guardian showed Conservatives losing 15 seats, Labour 18, Liberal Democrats 14, and other parties three. The official Lib Dem responses, described by acting party chief executive, Hilary Stephenson, as \"strongly rooted in localism\" and written by members in the local regions, range from regions where only a handful of seats are singled out for significant changes, to areas like the West Midlands and the north-west, where the Boundary Commission proposals are all but torn up. In the West Midlands the party wants changes to 30 of the 54 proposed boundaries, in the north-west to 46 out of the 68 new seats. With many other \"minor changes\" requested, in the north-west party campaigners were happy to accept only five of the official new constituencies, and a further one where they only request a name change. The party said on Tuesday that very varying levels of happiness or objection to the plans was explained by different approaches taken by each of the nine English regional boundary commission teams, and \u2013 in turn \u2013 by the local party activists. Where the party was deeply unhappy about a few seats, redesigning the boundaries would have knock-on impacts on several others, leading to high numbers of proposals for the official proposals to be \"reconfigured\", in the language of the consultation. The depth of unhappiness reflected in the documents raises the prospect that Lib Dems might not vote for the new electoral boundaries when they are presented to MPs and lords later next year \u2013 something party leader Nick Clegg could use to exert influence in other areas of constitutional reform, such as the House of Lords. A Lib Dem source pointed out that the party had kept its \"end of the bargain\" by voting to allow the review, along with a referendum last year on whether to introduce an alternative vote (AV) system for elections. However a spokesman played down the issue, saying: \"Liberal Democrats agree with the principle of equalising constituencies so that every vote counts the same. We are actively engaging with the Boundary Review. The review is still at an early stage and it is appropriate to make representations to ensure issues like keeping communities together and respecting physical geography are taken into account.\" Among the commonest complaints are constituencies with hugely varied social make-up, and those with \"detached parts\". These include the case of Gloucester city centre, which has been removed from the middle of the Gloucester constituency and added to an outside constituency, to the anger of local residents. Another is the proposed new constituency of Mersey Banks, which would encompass communities on both sides of the Mersey river which are not connected by any bridge, and takes in parts of Liverpool city and swathes of neighbouring Cheshire. The proposal was strongly criticised when it emerged by sitting local Labour MP Alison McGovern: \"Under our current electoral system the link between electors and their elected representative has always been seen as one of the strong points of the system,\" said McGovern. \"The proposed Mersey Bank constituency stretches that link beyond credulity and risks doing irreparable damage to the relationship MPs have with their constituents.\" In most areas Lib Dems report they are happy with the Boundary Commission dividing regions into three areas, into which the new constituencies must fit. However the West Midlands response criticises the creation of \"artificial sub-regions\", which it claims make it harder for the commissioners to stick to other guidelines, such as respecting community links. Some regions also criticise the insistence on not \"splitting\" electoral wards, which they claim can create bigger problems for local voters forced into less cohesive groupings. Under national review, all but four constituencies would have an average of 76,641 registered voters - a number that can only vary either way by 5%, in practice giving a range of between 72,810 and 80,473 electors.",

      "body": "<p>Liberal Democrats have objected to nearly one in three of the new constituencies proposed in a major shakeup of how MPs are elected \u2013 keeping alive the prospect of a rebellion by the coalition partners against the changes.</p> <p>In the most strongly worded objections, from the West Midlands region, party members describe the <a href=\"http://consultation.boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Boundary Commission for England</a> proposals as \"schizophrenic, unnecessary and haphazard\".</p> <p>The Lib Dem response is revealed among 25,000 documents released on Tuesday onto the Boundary Commission website as part of their ongoing review, designed to reduce the number of English MPs from 533 to 502.</p> <p>Across the UK, the electoral map is being redrawn to consolidate 650 constituencies to 600, all with a roughly equal number of voters, plans which are due to be finalised later this year and voted on by both houses of parliament in 2013, before the next general election.</p> <p>There are conflicting reports about how great the impact will be on different parties, though many suggest the Lib Dems would lose a disproportionate level of their current 57 MPs. One <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/datablog/2011/jun/06/boundary-change-constituency-lewis-baston\" title=\"\">analysis by Lewis Baston and Kevin Larkin for the Guardian</a> showed Conservatives losing 15 seats, Labour 18, Liberal Democrats 14, and other parties three.</p> <p>The official Lib Dem responses, described by acting party chief executive, Hilary Stephenson, as \"strongly rooted in localism\" and written by members in the local regions, range from regions where only a handful of seats are singled out for significant changes, to areas like the West Midlands and the north-west, where the Boundary Commission proposals are all but torn up.</p> <p>In the West Midlands the party wants changes to 30 of the 54 proposed boundaries, in the north-west to 46 out of the 68 new seats. With many other \"minor changes\" requested, in the north-west party campaigners were happy to accept only five of the official new constituencies, and a further one where they only request a name change.</p> <p>The party said on Tuesday that very varying levels of happiness or objection to the plans was explained by different approaches taken by each of the nine English regional boundary commission teams, and \u2013 in turn \u2013 by the local party activists. Where the party was deeply unhappy about a few seats, redesigning the boundaries would have knock-on impacts on several others, leading to high numbers of proposals for the official proposals to be \"reconfigured\", in the language of the consultation.</p> <p>The depth of unhappiness reflected in the documents raises the prospect that Lib Dems might not vote for the new electoral boundaries when they are presented to MPs and lords later next year \u2013 something party leader Nick Clegg could use to exert influence in other areas of constitutional reform, such as the House of Lords.</p> <p>A Lib Dem source pointed out that the party had kept its \"end of the bargain\" by voting to allow the review, along with a referendum last year on whether to introduce an alternative vote (AV) system for elections. However a spokesman played down the issue, saying: \"Liberal Democrats agree with the principle of equalising constituencies so that every vote counts the same. We are actively engaging with the Boundary Review. The review is still at an early stage and it is appropriate to make representations to ensure issues like keeping communities together and respecting physical geography are taken into account.\"</p> <p>Among the commonest complaints are constituencies with hugely varied social make-up, and those with \"detached parts\".

      "bodyText": "He was the self-taught \"elite hacker\" behind devastating attacks on the US Senate, the Zimbabwean government and a string of enemies in between. From the New York apartment block he shared with his two children, 28-year-old Hector Xavier Monsegur led an audacious double life as the internet activist \"Sabu\" \u2013 something of a celebrity in the world of hackers. But Monsegur was finally unmasked on Tuesday after it emerged that he had pleaded guilty to computer hacking charges and had acted as an informant for the FBI since August 2011, just as the international crackdown on the notorious Anonymous hacker collective gathered pace. Monsegur was deeply involved in attacks on behalf of WikiLeaks in December 2010, according to court papers unsealed in New York on Tuesday. The hacker acted as a \"rooter\", identifying weak spots in the websites of multinational firms including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal which his Anonymous group of \"hacktivists\" would then attempt to exploit. The 27-page indictment of Monsegur reads like a hall of fame of online sabotage. According to the FBI, Sabu was intimately involved in the WikiLeaks \"Operation Payback\" attacks that managed to steal documents from the Yemen and Zimbabwe governments and deface the website of the Tunisian prime minister. Sabu was always quick to claim responsibility for the attacks, aiming to taunt law enforcement bodies and gain respect from his peers. And although rumours of his identity began to circulate in the hacker community, his precise details remained unknown. On 7 June last year, the act was over. FBI officials found Monsegur at his Manhattan apartment. According to the US media, the expert hacker had been foiled by his own carelessness. The FBI discovered that he had logged into an internet chatroom from his own internet address \u2013 a schoolboy error of computer hacking. Unknown to his fellow hackers, Monsegur quietly pleaded guilty to 12 charges related to computer interception on 15 August last year. And, threatened with 124 years in prison, he agreed to become an FBI informant. The FBI took his own battered laptop and replaced it with their own \u2013 which they monitored around the clock. Online, he maintained his bravura attitude. \"Next thing you'll say is I work for the CIA and I'm a blackop,\" he snapped at a Guardian inquiry on Twitter after the Sun's website was hacked in July. \"Am I snitch/informant? Lets be real \u2013 I don't know any identities of anyone in my crew,\" said an online post attributed to Monsegur in October last year \u2013 weeks after he was \"flipped\" by US authorities. \"And the last thing I'd ever do is take down my own people. I am a grown ass man I can handle my own issues. I've been to jail before \u2013 I don't fear it. In fact there is very little I am afraid of especially these days.\" The post was a response to other hackers who were increasingly accusing Sabu of being a \"media whore\" and an informant. The rumours were rife \u2013 little more than 14 hours after he avoided imprisonment by assisting the US government, one group claimed Sabu was a \"Chinese infiltrator\". \"Lately I've been chilling; enjoying time off to focus on my personal life. I'm not tied to this the rest of my life,\" said the post linked to Sabu's Twitter account. \"I've already made my impact. If I disappear now or get knocked, its already too late \u2026 Sadly people want to exonerate themselves from their responsibility \u2013 like emailing the feds for immunity.\" Monsegur described himself in the post as a professional security researcher, but the computer genius had been unemployed since the closure of filesharing giant LimeWire, according to US authorities who spoke to Fox News. The broadcaster cited Monsegur's handlers, who described him as an anti-government, anti-capitalist hacker who had a political edge. They said his now-infamous online moniker had been taken from a professional wrestler born on nearby Staten Island, known as Sabu the Elephant Boy. The hacker clearly drew inspiration from the New York fighter. He routinely responded aggressively to police, journalists and others on social networking websites. \"I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks, I also don't give a fuck if you have a beef with me,\" said a post attributed to him on the Pastebin website. \"The end result is always going to be: You. Can. Not. Stop. Me. Deal with it.\" The FBI handlers described Monsegur as brilliant but lazy. According to Fox News, US authorities found him selling stolen credit card details to others on Facebook. It is not clear how lucrative Monsegur's brief reign of terror was. But the downfall of Sabu will continue to send reverberations through online hacker collectives for a long time to come.",

      "bodyText": "The FBI turned a computer hacker to build its case against a group of people it alleges are responsible for a string of audacious attacks that captured the personal details of more than one million people, US court documents have revealed. They reveal an astonishing degree of co-operation between the FBI and its source, who gave the bureau details of other hackers and advance notice of attacks \u2013 which the FBI then apparently allowed to happen. The FBI even provided its own servers for members of hacking collectives to use. The indictment sheets detail charges against five men alleged to be principal members of the hacking groups Anonymous and Lulzsec. The source has been indicated to be Hector Xavier Monsegur, known as 'Sabu', one of the group's most visible members and often referred to as the group's leader. Monsegur was arrested by US authorities on 7 June 2011, according to his charge document, and from this point is not described as a member of Anonymous or Lulzsec. By August 2011 he had pleaded guilty to twelve charges relating to computer hacking. His online avatar, Sabu, has subsequently remained active on Twitter and elsewhere, posting a final update less than 24 hours before the latest spate of arrests. Monsegur's arrest and guilty pleas have been kept secret until today, as he is said to have provided information against other arrested individuals. The crimes to which Monsegur has lodged a guilty plea carry a maximum jail sentence in excess of 124 years. Such sentences are often mitigated if offenders co-operate with authorities after their arrest. Another charge sheet, against Donncha O'Cearrbhaill, 19, from Ireland, sets out how Sabu's cooperation was central in building the FBI allegations. O'Cearrbhaill, is accused of two offences relating to intercepting and recording a conference call between the FBI and the UK's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, which was subsequently posted online in February. The indictment, written by the investigating FBI officer, details how Sabu, referred to as 'CW', communicated with other hackers \"acting under the direction of the FBI\". From information taken from internet chat logs \"recorded by the FBI with the CW's consent\", the document relating to O'Cearrbhaill recounts an online conversation between the informant and another individual, allegedly the defendant, using the nickname \"anonsacco\". In the first conversation, on 14 January 2012, anonsacco gets in touch asking Sabu for some technical help with a hack. \"Hi mate. Could I ask you for help? I need to intercept a conference call which would be a very good leak \u2026 If you could help me I am happy to leak the call to you solely. I guarantee it will be of interest!!\" The FBI agent confirms the conference call under question did indeed take place, and believed information on how to gain access had been gleaned from a previous email hack of the Irish police force, the Garda. Two weeks later, anonsacco got in touch with Sabu again through private chat. \"Hey mate. Would you like a recording of a call between SOCA and the FBI regarding anonymous and lulzsec?\" he said. \"I think we need to hype it up. Let the feds think we have been recording their calls.\" Sabu's responses are not recorded, but the indictment says he agreed to receive the file, which was then checked by the FBI and found to indeed be a recording of the conference call. Five days later, the recording was posted online. The indictment later details an earlier conversation with Sabu in which \"palladium\", allegedly another identity used by O'Cearrbhaill, is asked to corrobrate his identity. Palladium confirms details about his internet address and services he used to anonymise himself. If extradited and convicted, O'Cearrbhaill faces up to15 years in prison. The logs also detail Sabu's astonishing involvement in the hacking attack on the security company Stratfor, of which US citizen Jeremy Hammond is accused. A cache of more than 5m emails taken from an attack on the company's servers in December 2011 is currently being published by WikiLeaks, but the indictment documents reveal that straight after the attack, Sabu offered an FBI-owned server to store the cache \u2013 which was quickly accepted. \"btw I started unpacking on [CW-1]'s new server,\" an online identity alleged to be Hammond notes. This not only gave the FBI access to review or even potentially amend the cache, but also an inside track on Anonymous' discussions on how to use the documents, and potentially \u2013 though not revealed within the files unsealed to date \u2013 conversations between Anonymous and WikiLeaks. The US department of justice has convened a grand jury investigation into WikiLeaks, based in Virginia. If through Sabu or information he had gleaned from other Anons the US could glean any evidence to tie Julian Assange to hacking attacks on US soil, such as Stratfor, the case for extradition would be substantially strengthened. The extent of communication between WikiLeaks and Anonymous regarding the Stratfor leak is currently unknown. Throughout the logs detailed in the indictments published to date, the informer talks to other hackers in the room, at one stage even proposing publishing private password details: \"Wanna release that list of 92% cracked stratfor hashes?\" he asks. \"Hrm, your call...\" the defendent replies. \"I'd err on the side of no, so that way we can more fully exploit.\" Sabu also provided detailed information to authorities carrying out physical surveillance on Hammond prior to his arrest, giving details of login and logout times of various identities while FBI agents tracked internet use, use of TOR \u2013 a service which anonymises internet connections \u2013 and other activity at Hammond's addresss alongside his physical movements from 28 February 2012. Sabu's online persona has been silent since the legal files have been unsealed, but had continued unabated until shortly before, with recent tweets angrily denouncing the federal government. \"The feds at this moment are scouring our lives without warrants. Without judges approval. This needs to change. Asap,\" said one sent within the last day. \"The federal government is run by a bunch of fucking cowards. Don't give in to these people. Fight back. Stay strong,\" said another shortly afterwards His final tweet, sent less than 4 hours later, contained the last words of Marxist revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg. They translate as: \"The revolution says I am, I was, I will be.\"",

      "body": "<p>The FBI turned a computer hacker to build its case against a group of people it alleges are responsible for a string of audacious attacks that captured the personal details of more than one million people, US court documents have revealed.</p> <p>They reveal an astonishing degree of co-operation between the FBI and its source, who gave the bureau details of other hackers and advance notice of attacks \u2013 which the FBI then apparently allowed to happen. The FBI even provided its own servers for members of hacking collectives to use.</p> <p>The indictment sheets detail charges against five men alleged to be principal members of the hacking groups Anonymous and Lulzsec. The source has been indicated to be Hector Xavier Monsegur, known as 'Sabu', one of the group's most visible members and often referred to as the group's leader.</p> <p>Monsegur was arrested by US authorities on 7 June 2011, according to his charge document, and from this point is not described as a member of Anonymous or Lulzsec. By August 2011 he had pleaded guilty to twelve charges relating to computer hacking.</p> <p>His online avatar, Sabu, has subsequently remained active on Twitter and elsewhere, posting a final update less than 24 hours before the latest spate of arrests. Monsegur's arrest and guilty pleas have been kept secret until today, as he is said to have provided information against other arrested individuals.</p> <p>The crimes to which Monsegur has lodged a guilty plea carry a maximum jail sentence in excess of 124 years. Such sentences are often mitigated if offenders co-operate with authorities after their arrest.</p> <p>Another charge sheet, against Donncha O'Cearrbhaill, 19, from Ireland, sets out how Sabu's cooperation was central in building the FBI allegations. O'Cearrbhaill, is accused of two offences relating to intercepting and recording a conference call between the FBI and the UK's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, which was subsequently posted online in February.</p> <p>The indictment, written by the investigating FBI officer, details how Sabu, referred to as 'CW', communicated with other hackers \"acting under the direction of the FBI\". From information taken from internet chat logs \"recorded by the FBI with the CW's consent\", the document relating to O'Cearrbhaill recounts an online conversation between the informant and another individual, allegedly the defendant, using the nickname \"anonsacco\".</p> <p>In the first conversation, on 14 January 2012, anonsacco gets in touch asking Sabu for some technical help with a hack.</p> <p>\"Hi mate. Could I ask you for help? I need to intercept a conference call which would be a very good leak \u2026 If you could help me I am happy to leak the call to you solely. I guarantee it will be of interest!!\"</p> <p>The FBI agent confirms the conference call under question did indeed take place, and believed information on how to gain access had been gleaned from a previous email hack of the Irish police force, the Garda.</p> <p>Two weeks later, anonsacco got in touch with Sabu again through private chat. \"Hey mate. Would you like a recording of a call between SOCA and the FBI regarding anonymous and lulzsec?\" he said. \"I think we need to hype it up. Let the feds think we have been recording their calls.\"</p> <p>Sabu's responses are not recorded, but the indictment says he agreed to receive the file, which was then checked by the FBI and found to indeed be a recording of the conference call. Five days later, the recording was posted online.</p> <p>The indictment later details an earlier conversation with Sabu in which \"palladium\", allegedly another identity used by O'Cearrbhaill, is asked to corrobrate his identity.

      "bodyText": "It was the format whose revival in James Cameron's $237m budget Avatar brought crowds flocking back to the cinemas, but 3D film is already losing its appeal, pushed out of the picture by low-cost, British-made blockbusters like The King's Speech. Despite a record 47 films released in 3D last year, including the final Harry Potter and the latest in the Transformers franchise, box-office receipts for the format fell \u00a37m to \u00a3230m, reducing its share of total ticket sales from 24% to 20%. The Lion King's re-release in 3D failed to impress, as did Kung Fu Panda 2, with half its audiences opting to see it in two dimensions. As a result, the average takings per 3D film slumped from \u00a38.5m in 2010, when there were just 28 in the genre, to \u00a34.9m, according to a report by research firm Enders Analysis. \"A few years ago people went to 3D films just to see what it was like,\" said the report's author, Alice Enders. \"That period of experimentation is over. The reality has set in and the momentum has gone. The recession is a factor and families are pushing back against 3D.\" With 3D tickets costing on average 30% more at Odeon and Vue cinemas than other films, and with the added cost of glasses, which small children and those who wear contact lenses and spectacles often find uncomfortable, the format is losing its lustre. The biggest-grossing film of 2011, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, was released in both formats but took just 48% of its box-office income from 3D screenings, suggesting that the JK Rowling generation, now starting university or battling for jobs, are feeling the pinch. Home-grown hits enjoyed a record year, taking the second and third slots at the UK box office, in a triumph of storytelling over digital technology. Colin Firth's Oscar-winning turn as King George VI helped The King's Speech into second place with \u00a346m, while adolescent comedy TV series turned feature film The Inbetweeners Movie netted \u00a345m. The King's Speech was made on an estimated budget of \u00a39.5m, The Inbetweeners Movie on only \u00a33.5m. Their performance meant British films, both Independent and US-backed, took 36% of box office receipts, their biggest share in 10 years. Of those, 14% were independent films, the highest share achieved by features without foreign investment. The release of Avatar in 2009 \u2013 with a budget of $237m \u2013 ushered in a 3D craze which boosted UK admissions from 164m to 174m, their highest for seven years, and with cinemas able to charge a premium for the new format, takings rose even more dramatically, climbing from \u00a3854m in 2008 to \u00a31.04bn in 2011. It was a trend that seemed to defy the odds after audiences had become increasingly distracted by the wide array of video available at home from a growing number of digital channels, American TV series box sets, the Lovefilm home rental service and legal or pirated films online. The UK is the second-largest market for theatrical exhibition in Europe, behind France and ahead of Germany. Adding popcorn sales and screen advertising, Enders estimates our cinema industry was worth about \u00a31.4bn in 2011. But the 3D fad looks to be running out of steam, just as it did in the 1950s. This year, the number of 3D films released in the UK will fall to 33, some 14 fewer than in 2011. The outlook for cinema in 2012 is gloomy, with the Olympics expected to distract audiences. The year has started strongly for domestic cinema with Daniel Radcliffe's period horror The Woman in Black, made by King's Speech studio Momentum, dominating the league tables with takings of \u00a314m. But British films are unlikely to fill the vacuum left now that the Harry Potter franchise has come to an end, and both the Twilight and Pirates of the Caribbean sagas appear to be losing their pull. \"Fuel costs have risen, people are more careful about out-of-home travel; all these are long-term trends that are draining people away from the cinemas,\" said Enders.

      "bodyText": "After Sunday's Russian election, David Cameron called Vladimir Putin. He didn't quite congratulate him, but Cameron said that he looked forward to working with Russia's new president when he moved back into the Kremlin. The PM also said he hoped London and Moscow could \"overcome the obstacles in the relationship\", which, as everyone knows, are rather large. Putin's election victory on Sunday poses a dilemma for all western nations, not just the UK. Nobody is any doubt that the Putin who returns to the Kremlin in May is the same Putin who has effectively run Russia for the past 12 years \u2013 prickly, uncompromising, suspicious and fond of snide remarks about western hypocrisy and double standards. Inside Russia, the middle-class-led, Moscow-centric uprising against Putin is likely to continue. But the calculation inside EU foreign ministries is that Putin will tough out the protests and complete his new term in office until 2018. For better or for worse, then, it is Putin who will call the shots on Russia's foreign policy and prove strategically co-operative \u2013 or not \u2013 on the western Balkans, Syria, Iran and other international problems. Relations between London and Moscow have been tricky for nearly a decade. They were made worse by the 2006 polonium assassination of Alexander Litvinenko. Cameron has attempted a mini \"reset\" of ties, including a visit last year to Moscow with William Hague. But while his emphasis is on British business interests, Hague can't afford to ignore Russia's abysmal human rights record. Plus, there is the outstanding extradition request \u2013 rejected by Putin \u2013 for Andrei Lugovoi, Litvinenko's alleged murderer. \"All foreign policy and diplomatic relations are a mixture of realpolitik and moralpolitik,\" said Denis MacShane, Labour's former Europe minister. He believes the \"big foreign ministries of the world\" need to get together to work out how to deal with Putin over the next five to 10 years, while also reaching out to Russia's growing opposition. They need to bear in mind that Putin won't last for ever, he said: \"We should learn from lying back and having our tummy tickled by Gaddafi and Assad.\" Over the past decade, nobody had managed to come up with a successful Putinpolitik, or policy towards Russia, MacShane added. \"The Germans refuse to criticise him. Mrs Clinton announced a great reset after the George Bush era. Blair rushed to embrace him. Cameron, to be fair, has been more cautious and distant. But none of this has worked.\" MacShane and other MPs will call for 60 Russian officials involved in the killing of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky to be named and shamed \u2013 and to be denied entry to the UK. Magnitsky died in prison in 2009. Officials refused him medical treatment. The 37-year-old had accused Russian interior ministry officials of having stolen \u00a3150m in taxes paid by Hermitage, a British asset management company. The backbench debate has attracted heavyweight support from three former foreign secretaries and Tory and Labour MPs. A similar bill in the US is making progress towards Senate approval. Foreign Office officials hint there is some government will for a travel ban for corrupt officials \u2013 but it would have to be applied globally. For the moment the emphasis with Russia is on business matters \u2013 Russia is Britain's third biggest trading partner. According to David Clark, a former adviser to Robin Cook and chair of the Russia Foundation, visa bans and asset freezes are one of the few levers Britain has in its dealings with Moscow. \"They make Russian officials extremely angry,\" Clark said. \"They are scared by the idea because they love to go shopping in London. 'It isn't like old Soviet times, with everyone penned into an insular state and not able to travel. Kremlin bureaucrats are global now. And while they proclaim Russian nationalism, they regard themselves as global citizens.\" Russian officials enjoyed \"hobnobbing\" in Britain, Clark said \u2013 which was also a place where Russia's elite offshores its money. He conceded, however, that there were obstacles towards taking a tougher line on Moscow, principally European disunity and dependency on Russian oil and gas. Clark singled out German and Italy, and to a lesser extent France, for their accommodating attitude towards Moscow, which saw \"unilateralist commercial interests\" placed above human rights. \"You have to identify the point of vulnerability in Putin's system. There is a disconnect between this greater Russia chauvinism and Russian officials jetting around the place.\" For the moment, the best cards remain with Putin. Over the past week, he has hinted that he is willing to let Britain play a role in the Nord Stream project, which will see Siberian gas pumped under the Baltic directly to Germany. He has also struck a slightly more conciliatory tone on Syria. This may be helpful. It may not. Either way, it is now Putin \u2013 and not the hapless Dmitry Medvedev \u2013 who is again the west's interlocutor.",

This time they settled in for a five-day outreach residency, and it's been, as this part of the world is wont to be, a total hoot. Players were teamed up with local musicians and dispatched to the remotest islands \u2013 out to Unst, northernmost tip of the UK, and even Foula, tiny and sheer-cliffed, with a population of 20, give or take. Local fiddler Chris Stout was commissioned to write a piece for the occasion, and to include in it a tune that each team could arrange for a kind of inter-island playoff. Those versions had turned out brilliantly varied and imaginative; the full version, called Tingaholm after Shetland's ancient Norse gathering point, was premiered in Lerwick. As always, Stout's tunes are haunting, underpinned with earthy drones and ferocious, foot-stomping rhythms. He treats his violins like a band of Shetland fiddlers hurtling through a lopsided fugue, and fragments his melodies into rhythmic motives with shifting accents \u00e0 la Stravinsky. There's a touch of Reich, too, in his ostinatos that loop until fadeout. Some of these tripped the orchestra \u2013 probably a mix of the score needing fine-tuning and the orchestra being under-rehearsed. There's great material here, though; I'd love to hear a repeat performance before long. Britten's Four Sea Interludes and Sibelius's First Symphony made up the rest of the programme. It's tricky to conjure much magic in school-gym acoustics, but the orchestra under David Danzmayr did what they could; really, though, the magic of this residency has been outside the formal concerts. Remote schools workshops, impromptu late-night sessions crammed with locals and orchestral players \u2013 the outreach, it seems, has been mutual.",

      "bodyText": "Spotify users have spent 1,500 years inside apps within its desktop application since the start of December, the company has announced. That's just over 13.1m hours, which with 10m active Spotify users, means around 1.3 hours per user. Sten Garmark, Spotify's director of platform, revealed the figures at the Music Apps: Beyond the Hype conference in London. He also gave some numbers for specific apps on the platform. In February, users of the SoundDrop application \u2013 which helps people create virtual rooms to listen to collaborative playlists \u2013 listened to 15m songs together. Moodagent is generating more than 3.5m playlists a week with its Spotify app, while users of TuneWiki's Spotify app have edited or synchronised more than 100k songs in its lyrics \"wiki\", so other users can see the words to songs displayed as they play. \"Everyone has their individual idea for what Spotify should do next, which is why we love music apps,\" said Garmark, speaking to The Guardian in advance of the event. \"They are important so we can cater to all those needs. And since people are asking us to provide these features, when we do, music will be more valuable to them. They will be more likely to pay, and that makes more money for artists.\" Spotify and its streaming-music rivals have faced regular questions in recent months about how much money artists are making from streams of their music. Spotify launched its applications platform in late November 2011. The theory \u2013 and the reason Garmark is talking about engagement stats for the first wave of apps \u2013 is that these apps will help people discover and play more music, and thus start to increase the payouts for artists. \"We have to turn ourselves into the OS of music,\" says Garmark. \"We are in the middle of a transformation from being an app ourselves to being a platform. Spotify has also been opening up its catalogue to mobile app developers, having launched its CocoaLibspotify API for iOS in August 2011. One of the first iPhone apps to launch was SpotOn Radio, a personalised radio app that creates playlists based on artists. A bit like\u2026 \"Users are telling us it's like Pandora but better,\" says Garmark. \"And here's the interesting thing: they just killed us on the Swedish App Store. They passed us and went to number six in the chart. That might not seem like an obvious success for us, but it is.\" So, an iPhone app built on Spotify's API is now more popular than the main Spotify app \u2013 but since SpotOn Radio requires users to be paying for Spotify, this isn't a problem for the company. A number of startups and media companies \u2013 including The Guardian \u2013 jumped on board Spotify's desktop apps platform when it went live. The next wave of apps may come from another source though: music labels. \"It's a really interesting platform for artists and labels to really enhance the experience around the music,\" says Garmark. \"In this digital age of music, the experience in some ways got reduced to just a track or a playlist. But with these apps, it can start getting back to the old way of immersing yourself in the album cover, or reading about the music while listening to it. And artists can use it to connect with their audience.\" At the Music Apps event, Garmark showed a sneak peek of two new Spotify apps \u2013 as in apps for Spotify's desktop platform \u2013 that focus on artists. The Complete Collection shows digitised CD booklets to accompany albums by the likes of 50 Cent, Lionel Richie and Keane, while The Legacy Of brings in biographies, photos and playlists for artists including Bob Dylan. The apps are built using standard HTML5 technology, but Spotify is continuing to carefully manage the approval process. \"We have tremendous interest in the app platform, so we have built a team and are scaling it up to manage the onslaught of developers who want to work with us,\" says Garmark. \"It's a curated platform: we want to make sure the content is great, so we're not just letting anyone release anything. We're working with them to make sure it's good. We don't want our users to have crappy experiences with apps.\" For now, Spotify isn't announcing any news on when its apps platform will move to its own mobile applications, nor is it providing an update on any plans for app developers to share in advertising or subscription revenues. This is likely to remain a question mark for a number of developers and startups, but for labels making their own Spotify apps, the reward will come in more streams of their artists' music \u2013 meaning better payouts, but also increasing the value of Spotify itself, which the four major labels and independent agency Merlin have minority stakes in.",

It's a hard way to earn a crust, transferring fish from sea to plate, not helped tonight as he comes down with a violent bout of seasickness, which threatens to capsize the entire project. But that's small beer compared with the fate of the coastal fishing industry overall, which today sees ever greater numbers going out of business. David Stubbs Gok Wan: Made In China 8pm, Channel 4 Gok Wan, who has \"Made in China\" tattooed across the back of his neck, visits his family's country to see what it means, both for him and the goods that are manufactured there. He's baffled and thrilled in turn as he makes his semi-spiritual journey, which takes in a bra factory and replica English village Thames Town. \"When I go to the afterlife I want someone to burn me an entire set of Louis Vuitton luggage,\" he declares at a Buddhist ritual to offer gifts to his dead ancestors. Hannah Verdier Venice 24/7 8.30pm, BBC4 Look past the sheer beauty of its grand facades and Venice is a city that requires plenty of upkeep just to stay afloat. Here's a fly-on-the-canal-wall series that follows those on the frontline of such efforts, the emergency services and other local officials. First up, it's winter. As snow covers the city, there's a sunken boat to retrieve, an elderly lady has had what appears to be a stroke and, a huge fear in a place of wooden buildings, fire breaks out. Plus, how Venice uses the rubbish it produces to generate power. Jonathan Wright She Wolves: England's Early Queens 9pm, BBC4 Say what you like about the Queen \u2013 she's either benign, or a globe-trotting charity worker-cum-ambassador with a sturdy waving schedule. It hasn't always been this way. Some early female usurpers of the crown, the \"she wolves\" of the title, were chased down and vilified. In a new series, Dr Helen Castor looks at the queens of medieval and Tudor times, their turbulent accessions to power, and their struggles to keep hold of it in excessively male-dominated societies. Ben Arnold Granny's Moving In: A Wonderland Film 9pm, BBC2 The combination of people living longer and the rising expense of housing the elderly in retirement residences has led to many relations deciding to care for the older generation themselves. Phil and Sue Carroll take in 83-year-old Peggy (Sue's mother), perhaps not realising what they have let themselves in for. Despite being in the early stages of dementia, Peggy isn't prepared to slow down any time soon, so while she's out on the town dancing, Phil and Sue sit at home and worry. Martin Skegg Free Speech 10pm, BBC3 BBC3's latest attempt to sell politics to the 16-24 demographic sees four prominent figures debate hot topics, such as recent benefit cuts, while the audience at home influence the debate via Twitter. Though it might be easy to scoff at the faintly ludicrous 'social media' element of the format \u2013 the blurb trumpets that viewers can \"use hashtags to show their like or dislike of panellists as they speak in real time\"- the fact remains that Question Time is a damn sight more enjoyable when watched alongside a rolling feed of snarky comments, so we're hoping for more of the same here.

      "bodyText": "A year ago Liberal Democrat members voted to demand changes to the government's proposed health reforms. At the time of their 2011 spring conference, the health and social care bill was beginning its passage through the Commons. The changes the party called for would have reduced the marketisation of the health service, controlled the introduction of competition, brought some local democratic accountability, and retained commissioning as a public sector function. The terms of the motion would still have respected the Conservative policies (for example, a greater role for GPs in commissioning) agreed in the coalition programme. The government subsequently embarked on a \"listening exercise\", but those of us in the party who proposed the key amendments were very disappointed with the results. It failed to deliver most of what had been called for in respect of competition, marketisation and undemocratic structures. We went to great lengths, explaining to the party leadership and parliamentarians what the problems were. Indeed the amendments we felt were needed were all tabled by Andrew George MP, but not debated. At the party's autumn conference activists were denied the opportunity to debate another motion setting out their concerns. \"Wait for the Lords to sort it out,\" we were told. On Tuesday night the Lords completed the bulk of the revision of the bill. Have the concerns of the party been met? In short, no. The bill does now offer improved transparency of decision-making in commissioning, tackles conflicts of interest, and rules out price competition. But it does not deliver on local democratic accountability. And it fails to provide the required safeguards against existing NHS services being destabilised by competition. The regulator, Monitor, is partly constrained from letting competition rip. But the bill is still framed so that a market-oriented regulator (which is what Monitor's personnel are bound to be) will be free to drive competition into the health service \"in the patient's interest\", as there is no reciprocal requirement to promote collaboration. The remaining problems are significant. First, the failure to hold in check Labour's own drive towards the privatisation of commissioning. This is despite the Lib Dem conference having called for planning of health services to be a public function and not hived off to the sharp suits from PwC or McKinsey with all their vested interests. Second, after the so-called \"listening exercise\", the government made the bill much worse by requiring GPs to promote both choice (and thus competition) and \"innovation\" above tackling the deep-seated problems of unfair access to healthcare and gross disparities in health outcomes. No Liberal Democrat should support a bill with that order of priority. So while Lib Dem peers have won important concessions, especially in the area of competition law, and while the bill now contains requirements designed to preserve integrated care, it still goes well beyond the coalition agreement. Despite the fact that this bill is designed in the image of successive Labour health secretaries, from Alan Milburn to Patricia Hewitt, the pure raw politics of health should dictate to many Liberal Democrats \u2013 and even Tories in their more sanguine moments \u2013 that this bill be ditched. It has no friends among even the non-party-political royal colleges, and has no mandate in those areas where it goes beyond the coalition agreement. The political impact will be to retoxify the Tory brand \u2013 which they are welcome to do, of course \u2013, but also, by association, to damage the Lib Dems. Some damage is a logical consequence of a deal that involves deficit reduction. But this bill adds extra unnecessary political pain. Unless there are more last-minute changes to deliver what the party required, at this weekend's party conference I urge Lib Dems to call for the plug to be pulled on this legislation \u2013 for the sake of the NHS. \u2022 Dr Evan Harris is vice chair of the Lib Dems' federal policy committee.

When he writes ballets or operas, or drags up for a Judy Garland tribute, he's not genre-hopping, but confirming that he stands alone, sui generis. Tonight he's gone for a high-art overload. Dressed in a dapper suit set off with a green diamante brooch, Wainwright performs fully orchestrated settings of five Shakespeare sonnets, preceded by a straight reading of each sonnet by actress Si\u00e2n Phillips. Wainwright has led different versions of these before, in Berlin and San Francisco, while three of them appeared on his last album, accompanied only by piano. Here, deliciously arranged for a 60-piece orchestra, these introspective miniatures are transformed into operatic arias, lurching between lush romanticism and sprightly modernism. If you're being churlish, the angular chord sequences on Sonnet 43 don't particularly suit Wainwright; the octave leaps on Sonnet 129 are a little too high for his voice; while his ultra-slow, one-syllable-a-bar delivery rarely enlivens the iambic pentameter. But these reservations are quickly forgotten, because the overall sound is so impressive. The first half of the show, showcasing the BBC Symphony Orchestra, kept to the Shakespeare theme, but also served as a whistle-stop tour through 20th-century modernism, featuring works by John Adams and Erich Korngold, and four lengthy excerpts from Prokofiev's majestic Romeo and Juliet. It would be hubristic to describe Wainwright as an orchestral composer to rank alongside them, but the noise he makes is wonderful, and his shtick is an effective one.",

      "bodyText": "An ancient political beast, who generally prowls his own area of the jungle quietly, came to life on Monday. To the surprise of some new Conservative MPs, who regard him as something of a Euro-softie, Kenneth Clarke jumped to the defence of controversial plans by George Osborne to withdraw child benefit from higher-rate taxpayers. \"We've all got, I'm afraid, to find that we're tightening our belt a bit to get ourselves out of the mess we're in to get the economy recovering again,\" the justice secretary told ITV News. The intervention by Clarke came as little surprise to senior Tories with more nuanced views of the oldest member of the cabinet, who is still regarded with suspicion on the right after his blunt advice to Margaret Thatcher in 1990 to stand down as prime minister. One veteran said: \"People have forgotten that Ken Clarke is a Thatcherite \u2013 if, of course, you take away his views on Europe. He was one of the few ministers in the 1980s and the 90s who delivered Thatcherite policies while others were big girl's blouses who wimped out. Only Ken can really ask why we are handing money out to the middle classes in the form of child benefit to help them pay their taxes.\" Clarke, who stood unsuccessfully for the Tory leadership on three occasions between 1997 and 2005, was summoned by David Cameron from the backbenches in 2009 on the advice of George Osborne. The future chancellor calculated that the presence of a former, highly respected chancellor would give the Tory team greater credibility on the economy after the financial crash in late 2008. A veteran of 11 general elections, Clarke criticised the idea of a coalition during the 2010 general election more strongly than any other Tory as he warned that the inevitable uncertainty could destabilise the pound. But since his appointment to the cabinet as justice secretary \u2013 the coalition meant that he lost his chance to succeed Lord Mandelson as business secretary \u2013 Clarke has won the confidence of the Liberal Democrats, who regard him as collegiate and a restraining influence on the Tory right. This explains why Lib Dems have been relatively relaxed about his proposals to extend the number of trials that will be held behind closed doors to protect intelligence. Clarke announced a watering-down of the policy yesterday. One Lib Dem said: \"Ministers from both parties have been working together to get the right balance. The nightmare scenario floated by some, in which cases in civil courts are held in secret, is not on the agenda. Nobody thinks Ken Clarke is trying to pull a fast one.\" Another Lib Dem explained the party's affection for Clarke. \"We think Ken Clarke is a great. We think he is a big beast who, in the face of relentless campaigning by the rightwing media, has kept his humour and not changed his principles. Most other people would struggle to do that.\" Clarke has been attacked by the rightwing press, though less stridently in the Daily Mail, which gave him the best part of a page to explain his change of tack yesterday. It is often forgotten that Paul Dacre, the Mail's editor, supported his leadership bid in 2001 instead of the impeccably eurosceptic Iain Duncan Smith. The Sun has been forthright in pushing for Cameron to move Clarke from the Ministry of Justice as punishment for watering down Tory crime policy. Clarke, who will be 72 in July, has let it be known in Downing Street that he has no intention of retiring and would like to remain in the cabinet until the general election. One senior Tory said: \"Any idea that Ken is ready to shuffle off and go to the House of Lords \u2013 forget it. He is thoroughly enjoying life in the cabinet. He looks amazingly young for a man in his 70s, apart from the tum. \"Ken has a great deal to offer; David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg recognise his vast experience. And he has a hide like a rhinoceros. When the right turns on him he responds with humour and, like a true big beast, shakes off the criticism and carries on.\"",

      "bodyText": "Syria has again refused to allow aid into the destroyed suburb of Homs amid mounting evidence of human rights abuses, including the torture of victims at a hospital inside the city. A defiant President Bashar al-Assad said he was determined to go on fighting what he called \"foreign-backed terrorism\". \"The Syrian people, who have in the past managed to crush foreign plots \u2026 have again proven their ability to defend the nation and to build a new Syria through their determination to pursue reforms while confronting foreign-backed terrorism,\" he said, according to the state news agency Sana. State television claimed residents were now slowly returning on foot to Baba Amr. It showed men, women and children trudging past ruined and bullet-marked buildings. There was also footage of a cramped tunnel which Damascus says was used to smuggle arms. But locals said the reports had been fabricated. Speaking via Skype from the Insha'at area, which neighbours Baba Amr, one resident, Sami, said: \"No one has tried to go back there.\" He said the accents of people interviewed on state TV suggested they were from coastal areas and not from Homs. \"It makes me laugh when I see state TV,\" he said. \"We know that it is untrue.\" A spokesman for the Red Cross said that despite the authorities giving permission for it to deliver aid and medical supplies to Baba Amr last Thursday, they were still being denied access on the grounds of security. Russia and China have made clear again that they are still standing by the regime in Damascus, while western leaders again ruled out a Libya-style military intervention. The White House said on Tuesday that the president, Barack Obama, was committed to diplomatic efforts to end the violence, saying Washington sought to isolate Assad, cut off his sources of revenue and encourage unity among his opponents. The United States is proposing a new security council resolution demanding an end to the violence in Syria, first by government forces and then by opposition fighters. Residents who fled Baba Amr spoke of bodies decomposing under rubble, sewage mixing with litter in the streets and a campaign of arrests and executions. \"The smell of death was everywhere. We could smell the bodies buried under the rubble all the time,\" said Ahmad, who escaped to Lebanon, according to agency reports. \"We saw so much death that at the end the sight of a dismembered body \u2026 stopped moving us.\" There was further violence reported across Syria. In Herak, in Deraa province, where the revolt erupted nearly a year ago, residents said armoured vehicles and tanks had massed on the western fringe of the city and in parts of the centre. There were raids reported in the city of Deir al-Zor. Activists also claimed attacks had continued in Rastan. Video footage emerged apparently showing a staff general who had defected to the Free Syrian Army in protest at the assault on the city. In it, Adnan Qassim Farazat, holding his identity card, said: \"I declare my defection from the Syrian army to the Free Syrian Army, because of the artillery bombing against Rastan which is continuing violently.\" He added: \"Houses have been damaged and children and women were killed. This is not the right behaviour of the Syrian army.\" Security forces also opened fire on Tuesday on protests in Douma, a suburb north-east of Damascus which was briefly held by the rebels in January, according to reports that could not be verified. Omer Hamza, an activist in Douma, claimed several tanks and armoured vehicles, and ten busloads of shabiha, or armed thugs, were seen in a village north of Yabrud, between Damascus and Homs. \"A few houses were damaged and some people were detained,\" he said. Four people were killed in Yabrud, he added. Once again three of the bodies were taken by the security forces, he said. A large funeral was held for the fourth victim, Burhan al-Sihli, whose body was recovered. Secretly shot video footage aired on Monday by Channel 4 showed what it said were Syrian patients tortured by medical staff at a state-run hospital in Homs. The video, which Channel 4 said it could not independently verify, showed wounded, blindfolded men chained to beds. A rubber whip and electrical cable lay on a table in one ward. Patients showed what looked like signs of severe beatings. \"I have seen detainees being tortured by electrocution, whipping, beating with batons, and by breaking their legs. They twist the feet until the leg breaks,\" the employee who made the video said.",

      "bodyText": "Thulami Mtembu has worked at Magwa tea farm for 33 years. For him it's more than a job. \"It's the smell. Every day I come here I feel so refreshed,\" he says. \"I love the aroma of the tea bush. The conditions here make our tea special.\" The fragrant, lime-green bushes stretch away to the horizon at the biggest tea plantation in the southern hemisphere. It is a deceptively tranquil scene. Magwa has been racked by strikes, violence and financial strife that have brought production to a standstill and put its future in doubt. The crisis encapsulates South Africa's struggle to realise the potential of its wealth of natural resources. It is a story of low or unpaid wages, powerful unions, political inertia and allegations of financial mismanagement. It is a stark example of self-destruction. The 1,800-hectare (4,450 acre) Magwa farm outside Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape province is blessed with an ideal climate and soil type for growing tea. At its peak five years ago it came close to profitability, producing 2.7m tonnes of tea in a season, sold in advance to countries including Britain, China, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The farm employed 1,200 permanent and 2,300 seasonal workers. But when the market shrank and the tea price declined, the problems began. The provincial economic development corporation stepped in and, despite emergency subsidies from the state, tensions over wages erupted. The farm claimed its workers were the best paid in the industry, earning five times more than their counterparts in Malawi. But even today, some still earn 1,100 rand (\u00a391) a month, below the national minimum wage of R1,376 for farm work, according to Nkosinathi Mbolo, who is arbitrating between management and employees. Sweating in the afternoon sun, Vukile Jikwayo, 51, a mechanic clad in blue overalls, said he earned R1,250 a month: \"It is not enough. That is why we are still fighting. The money is too little \u2013 I have to buy food and educate five children. All we want is a better income.\" From 2009, the workers rebelled over changes to their terms of conditions which they said were made without consultation. Labourers who pluck tea leaves and throw them over their shoulder into a backpack were told to increase their haul from 200kg to 253kg a day on the same pay, according to the Food and Allied Workers Union (Fawu). Then, despite tight finances, Magwa's management gave pay rises of 100% to some workers but not others, the union claims. \"This led to conflict among the workers: management was selective in terms of compensation,\" said Mbalisi Tonga, Fawu's provincial secretary in Eastern Cape. \"The manager said he would reward, in his words, 'deserving cases'.\" Tonga said there was further resentment when, to comply with the law, workers' lunch breaks were extended from 30 minutes to an hour \u2013 but with a deduction of six rand. \"At that point, they unified the workers. The workers said we must fight and the strike started.\" There was a strike in 2010 and again in 2011. What happened during the latter is bitterly disputed. Tonga claims picketing workers were beaten and arrested by police. Magwa's management accused the workers of a violent rampage in which shots were fired, buildings gutted and a security guard killed. Estate manager Mtembu said: \"The place was ruined. They burned all the houses, destroyed protective clothing and removed everything \u2013 furniture, ceilings, floors, windows. It was a looting spree. They bashed and burned managers' cars. Offices were torched and quite a lot of rebuilding had to be done. \"The management ran away and it was a free-for-all. A security guard was killed and supervisors were severely beaten. Any manager present that day would have been killed too. We've had strikes before but nothing as violent as this one. It was workers versus management. Some of the workers themselves were beaten because they got caught off guard.\" King Masangwana, a factory manager, said: \"It was so violent you can't stand it. You had to run for your life.\" Magwa security manager Daan Schoeman was quoted by South African media last year as saying a manager called him with a desperate plea for help. \"He said, 'Help Daan, they're killing me,' but I couldn't do anything. It was impossible to get in. They chopped him up with pangas [machete-like tools], but he made it out [alive]. One of the security guards, though, was shot dead. It was terrible. That day, I started becoming an old man.\" The union denies the charges. Tonga said: \"From the information we got, there was no violence. We trust our sources because there were court cases. Complainants \u2026 have not been able to sustain their claims in court.\" Asked about the death, he replied: \"I have heard about it and some members were taken to court, but it could not be sustained and they were acquitted.\" The management used the strikes as a convenient excuse to flee, Tonga added. \"You can't, when you have a strike, go away. This escalates the strike. We sympathise with the taxpayers. As the management, you are supposed to take the responsibility and face it. That's what they have been failing to do. \"What happens at Magwa is that if there's a strike, it's a holiday for management. They got paid for sitting at home. We try talking to them but they are not available.\" The general manager, Ian Crawford, left the estate last September. Attempts by the Guardian to contact him failed. Last month, speaking to South Africa's Financial Mail, he described Magwa as \"a murky, messy scenario with politicians and other people ducking and diving\" and said he was taking it to court for money he is owed. \"Until the politics around Magwa is resolved and discipline is restored in the workplace, it will never recover,\" he added. \"I don't believe it will ever get up and running again. It's game over for a project that had huge potential to uplift poor people.\" Crawford has been criticised by workers and the government alike. Ayabulela Ngoqo of the department of rural development and agrarian reform, said: \"Mr Crawford was running Magwa like his own house. He was a man who could stop on the side of the road and sign a cheque. There was a revolt from the workers who were not satisfied with the way he was managing Magwa.\" Other managers who had left the farm in February 2011 returned in November, too late to save that year's harvest. In some months workers went unpaid. Mtembu said: \"When we came back, pruning was a waste of time. A whole season was lost: maybe about R30m. Everything we are doing now is getting ready for next season. We talk to the workers \u2013 but we make sure we don't talk about the past.\" An uneasy truce has been reached, with managers and workers in dialogue, though some managers remain offsite. But a shortage of funds to invest in tractors, trailers, coal and diesel means that employees have been reduced to \"piece work\" of six hours instead of the standard nine. The fields are being maintained in readiness but there is no guarantee of a harvest in September. Machinery is lying idle. The last date written on a chalkboard at the entrance is 04-02-11. Inside the giant sheds, rows of conveyor belts are standing still and tea-cutting equipment gathers dust. Power generators are lifeless, while vast coal boilers for steaming tea are empty. \"This would normally be operating at full steam,\" said Mbolo. \"But there is a shortage of coal and parts.\" So the paralysis continues. Mtembu said: \"As far as production is concerned, there is nothing happening. We don't have funds to buy coal or diesel. We have made requests to the government. It did promise R20m to assist with the planting but sometimes politicians make promises and don't cover all the costs. \"There is no pay rise. We cannot predict another strike. If the workers want to do those things they'll simply do them. If they want to resort to violence, they'll resort to violence. It depends on the quality of the union leadership.\" But Mtembu is determined and optimistic that South Africa's last tea plantation can be saved. \"I would not have come back if I did not feel the company has potential. There's no point sitting at home with so much knowledge: let me assist. The company was once a star and can be a star again. Once you get this place going, it will be so beautiful.\" That will require some 30m rand to be found \u2013 and quickly. Ngoqo said the government was still working on a rescue package. \"The department is trying to source funding so the farm can be running smoothly and undertaking harvesting. It is a priority. We don't want the people to lose their jobs.\" Until then, Magwa is left clinging to past glories. Tonga reflected: \"People say it's the best quality tea. Twenty years ago they got a trophy from France for the best tea in the world. That trophy is not there now. I don't know if it got lost or burned down with the office.\"",

Every day I come here I feel so refreshed,\" he says. \"I love the aroma of the tea bush. The conditions here make our tea special.\"</p> <p>The fragrant, lime-green bushes stretch away to the horizon at the biggest tea plantation in the southern hemisphere. It is a deceptively tranquil scene. Magwa has been racked by strikes, violence and financial strife that have brought production to a standstill and put its future in doubt.</p> <p>The crisis encapsulates South Africa's struggle to realise the potential of its wealth of natural resources. It is a story of low or unpaid wages, powerful unions, political inertia and allegations of financial mismanagement. It is a stark example of self-destruction.</p> <p>The 1,800-hectare (4,450 acre) Magwa farm outside Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape province is blessed with an ideal climate and soil type for growing tea. At its peak five years ago it came close to profitability, producing 2.7m tonnes of tea in a season, sold in advance to countries including Britain, China, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The farm employed 1,200 permanent and 2,300 seasonal workers.</p> <p>But when the market shrank and the tea price declined, the problems began. The provincial economic development corporation stepped in and, despite emergency subsidies from the state, tensions over wages erupted.</p> <p>The farm claimed its workers were the best paid in the industry, earning five times more than their counterparts in Malawi.

The council's planning committee on Tuesday unanimously rejected plans for 11 turbines, submitted by Acciona Energy UK for the Waun Garno site which is 12 miles south of the Snowdonia national park. The decision followed a vociferous opposition campaign and is being seen by opponents of onshore wind power as a major setback for the industry in Wales. The application for the 115m-tall structures was the first of a series to be heard by Powys council, which has 17 windfarm applications pending, spokesman said. Next week it will consider plans for a much larger 65-turbine windfarm, which will ultimately be decided by the Westminster government. Council planners said the Waun Garno scheme would have an \"unacceptable adverse impact on the landscape of the area\", adding the application lacked information about the impact on ecology and habitats. They also voiced concern about its impact on conservation areas. \"The combined landscape impact, visual impact, biodiversity impact, cultural heritage impact, public rights of way impact, noise impact and highway impact of the proposed development is considered to outweigh the benefits of the renewable energy contribution of the proposed development,\" said a council report. Close to 100 opponents of the scheme protested before the lunchtime meeting at Powys county hall in Llandrindod Wells. Opposition to new onshore wind farms has grown rapidly in Wales and 2,000 people attended a debate on the issue in Welshpool in June. The new turbines are much taller than existing ones and generate greater power, meaning they need new pylons. \"It is the first big refusal in mid-Wales of a windfarm application and it shows the protests, which started a year ago and have triggered a popular revolt against onshore wind farms, have been a success,\" said Robert Harvey, a co-ordinator of the Montgomeryshire Against Pylons campaign. \"A lot of us are green in that we support renewable energy but there is a massive contradiction in destroying some of the most beautiful places on the planet in order to achieve that. Increasingly, research is showing that wind energy is the most inefficient form of renewable energy.\" In a statement Acconia Energy said: \"We are naturally disappointed with today's decision not to grant planning approval for the Waun Garno windfarm. We will now carefully review the grounds for this decision and consider our options going forward.\"",

      "bodyText": "BP rewarded chief executive Bob Dudley with a $1.6m (\u00a31m) bonus and share payout last year despite paying out \u00a35bn to cover the long-running lawsuit over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Dudley was handed the bonus on top of his $1.7m pay \"for turning around the company\" after it plunged into loss after the Deepwater Horizon explosion that left 11 workers dead and much of the Louisiana's Gulf coast covered in oil. Former finance director Byron Grote, who took on a more general corporate business role in January, topped Dudley with a combined bonus and share payout worth $2.1m. Iain Conn, head of refining and marketing, received more than $1.4m in bonuses, shares and cash in lieu of a pension contribution. The pay and bonus figures were revealed in filings that Britain's biggest oil group made to the US securities and exchange commission as part of its New York listing. They were published only a day after the oil firm settled with restaurants, fishermen, hotel owners and other businesses and individuals affected by the blowout and subsequent spill disaster. Shares in BP on Tuesday dipped after rising nearly 2% on Monday as the City digested the \u00a35bn settlement agreed over the weekend. A BP spokesman said: \"Bob Dudley and his management team performed exceptionally well. They have put BP back on track to recovery. They turned a $5bn loss in 2010 into a $24bn profit in 2011. \"The company delivered $22 billion cash flow, took the value of assets sold above $20 billion, resumed dividend payments, and won a record 55 new exploration and production opportunities. He added: \"The downstream business delivered a record year of earnings and the company generally made huge progress in implementing a new safety organisation worldwide and fundamentally restructuring its upstream business.\" BP's future was put in doubt when the Deepwater Horizon well started spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Shares valued at more than 650p before the accident, had slumped to 305p, within months. The chief executive at the time, Tony Hayward, came under attack from US congressmen for mishandling the aftermath of the spill and eventually resigned. Dudley has overseen a rise in the share price to 504p, though his record has been tarnished by failed attempts to establish a large presence in Russia. The company still faces claims from various states and most significantly action by the Department of Justice, which said at the weekend the private settlement did not compensate for significant damages or BP's \"violation of the law\". The US state is bringing a negligence case against BP for the explosion on April 2010, which caused millions of barrels of oil to be leaked from the Deepwater Horizon rig, killed 11 workers and polluted beaches in Louisiana. If BP is found \"grossly negligent\" it could be fined as much as $18bn under the Clean Water Act alone but the company said \u2013 as it had argued all along \u2013 that this would not be the case. It said the \u00a35bn settlement reinforced previous estimates that the total cost of all liabilities should be no more than $37.2bn.",

      "bodyText": "London 2012 organisers have promised to provide a detailed breakdown of the final batch of 1.3m tickets that will be made available next month, to help prospective purchasers choose which to apply for. The organising committee and its partner Ticketmaster are under pressure to deliver following technical issues and controversies that have dogged the ticketing process amid huge demand. \"When we do our ticketing process in April, we'll tell people exactly how many tickets are available,\" said the Locog chief executive Paul Deighton. Around 20,000 people who thought they had secured tickets in the second round of sales but were subsequently let down have been given a 24-hour window to buy tickets. After that, the remaining 1m or so who missed out in the first phase will be given five days to apply on a first come, first served basis. But not all the tickets for all sessions will be made available at once and Deighton promised it would be clear exactly how many would be on offer for each session in every sport to help prospective purchasers plan their buying strategy. Deighton, who along with the chairman Lord Coe will face the London Assembly members who have been critical of the transparency of the ticketing process, will continue to resist requests to break down the percentage of tickets sold to the public for each session so far. \"The debate has been had. I'm not sure there's any more to say. We're not going to give any estimates before we're completely clear which tickets we've sold to whom and we can give a complete picture,\" he said. \"We're not going to give a running commentary after each sale, because it creates a misleading picture. I don't like putting out numbers based on assumptions and estimates.\" With hundreds of thousands of tickets likely to be on sale at public box offices in the run-up to the Games, in practice that means the final breakdowns will not be available until after the Olympics. Deighton, speaking at a Locog event to highlight diversity and inclusion policies that were praised by the equalities minister Lynne Featherstone, said he was confident the crowds at the Games would reflect London's population and not have a white, middle class bias. \"One of the reasons we saw such huge demand was because there was an awful lot of cheap tickets. By the time we've finished this, more than 2.5m tickets will have gone for \u00a320 or less. That's a very big chunk of them. People who normally wouldn't be able to get tickets had a chance to do that,\" he said. \"The final few hundred thousand tickets we're able to identify right at the end, there will be some box office stuff as well that will have a natural advantage for the local community. If the test events are anything to go by, I think we've got a decent balance in there.\" He said the cycling and diving test events highlighted the extent to which the crowd would \"reflect the fact it's the world's biggest international event\". Of the 8.8m tickets, 6.6m have been made available to the British public but for some of the most high profile events just over a third of those present will have received tickets reserved for the public. Deighton argued that, once sponsors tickets given away to the public and tickets sold in Europe to British buyers had been taken into account, the proportion would be much higher in practice. The final batch of 1.3m tickets will be for all sports except synchronised swimming, which was the first event to sell out following an embarrassing error where the tickets were over-sold. There are also still around 1.5m football tickets remaining, which will be marketed in earnest once the draw is made.",

      "bodyText": "He had been compared to Nureyev and Baryshnikov by critics and was made the Royal Ballet's youngest principal dancer at 19. Then he stunned the dance world by quitting a week before he was due to appear on stage. Now, in an interview with the Guardian, the Ukrainian Sergei Polunin has revealed that the gruelling demands of ballet, the boredom of rehearsals and a hankering for a more normal life mean that he intends to give up dance entirely by the time he is 26. By quitting the Royal Ballet in January, Polunin, now 22, lost his right to work in the UK, but he is back with a new visa that doesn't tie him to a specific company, and is about to dance in Men in Motion, a celebration of male ballet, with his friend Ivan Putrov. Polunin and Putrov sit in a harshly lit meeting room backstage after rehearsals at Sadler's Wells in London, where the show will be staged this month, its second outing after a run at the end of January. Putrov has clearly decided to take the role of elder brother, and starts the interview by announcing that Polunin will not discuss why he left the Royal Ballet. But it doesn't take long for Polunin to reveal attitudes which make the reasons for his departure clear. Performing is the only time he really enjoys dancing, he says. Rehearsing is \"very hard physical work and it can sometimes be very boring as well, learning stuff. You stop rehearsing at 8pm, by the time you come home it's 10 and then it's like: 'OK, I want to have at least six hours of normal life, just watching TV,' and the next morning it's just harder to wake up.\" He says he wishes ballet companies would do a month of rehearsal and then 30 performances of the same show, \"so you're just enjoying being on stage \u2013 not rehearse for a month then have one show, rehearse for another month and change the show. What's the point?\" \"So you would repeat a show 30 times?\" asks a baffled Putrov. \"I would not mind,\" says Polunin. \"I would not mind just waking up, knowing I have seven hours before a show, doing [a dance] I already know, and then doing my own thing. \"After a show you can't sleep for about seven, eight, nine hours and you think: 'I can't sleep anyway \u2013 I may as well just use [the time],'\" says Polunin. A few weeks before he left the Royal Ballet, Polunin's nocturnal activities raised some eyebrows. He tweeted a photograph of himself with his feet up, drinking from a can of Kronenbourg at 9.40am; another asked: \"Does anybody sell heroin? Need to bring my mood up.\" Of course it was a joke, but the Royal Ballet were unimpressed. \"They straight away told me off, because three people called in and complained,\" says Polunin. \"Not fans, critics. I was like, come on.\" The tweet remains undeleted to this day. Polunin says he wants to stop dancing at 26: \"I don't think I'd enjoy going against the body.\" Underlining how harsh the physical effects of ballet can be, he says the body starts deteriorating from the age of 24. \"Your feet and your knees \u2026 everything starts to hurt more.\" The dancer says he used to watch films like Goodfellas and The Godfather before performing at Covent Garden to keep his mind off things. Men in Motion includes the first dance he has ever choreographed, a piece about James Dean. \"I love movies and there's something close to me about James Dean \u2013 I always wanted to do choreography on him,\" says Polunin. \"First of all I saw James Franco play James Dean [in a 2001 TV movie] and I loved the character, the way he impersonated him. I went and got a tattoo of James Dean on my shoulder without actually seeing him in any movies.\" Tattoos spell freedom to Polunin. The subject makes his eyes light up; suddenly he sits up straight and stops fiddling with the chain around his neck. \"When I was a kid I always liked scratching myself \u2013 making shapes, making drawings, and I always thought I would have a tattoo,\" he says. He is part-owner of a tattoo parlour in London's Holloway Road, near his home, and went there to spend the night after leaving the Royal Ballet. It is his sanctuary from the regimented world of dance. The tattooists, he says, are \"normal people, from the streets, it's kind of gangster. They can do anything while they're tattooing: they can drink, they can smoke, all of them are free.\" Polunin says that hanging out there reminds him of spending time in amusement arcades as a child with his friends. He is from a poor background in Kherson, a remote town in Ukraine, and was pushed into dance by his parents in the hope that it would bring the family a better life. Having attained a scholarship to the Royal Ballet at the age of 13, it's easy to see how Polunin would have missed the camaraderie of his peers, and how he found it again at the tattooists. He says he envies people with tattoos on their faces or hands: they are, he believes, \"free people because they're not attached to anything \u2013 it means their job allows them to have this tattoo.\" However, rumours that Polunin will learn the craft himself are wide of the mark: \"It's a hard type of art to learn \u2013 you have to be able to draw.\" Polunin is cagey about what he would like to do next. \"I'd love to guest with an Arabic company and America always looked good,\" he says. \"In my head I want to do dancing as a hobby. I don't want it to be my job. I want to do it as a joy, not having to do not-very-good galas just to make my living.\" Polunin says that he would rather not dance at all than feel he was falling under par. As a child he was top of his class in gymnastics: \"I always had a medal, every competition, and then I got ill for a month and a half. When I came back, people who were not even close to being as good as me overtook me in competitions and I just changed \u2013 I was like 'I don't want to do it any more.' \"What's the point of being below people? So from there on I was like, if I'm not good enough, do something else, if you don't enjoy something, change it.\" He is enjoying not having to depend on the Royal Ballet for his visa, suggesting that they used it as a means of enforcing discipline: \"It was a big pressure. Because you're attached to one place, and if you mess it up by doing anything, you're out of the country, and they're constantly on your head so it wasn't really nice, but now it's much better.\" Monica Mason, the Royal Ballet's director, strongly denied the allegation. \"To suggest that the Royal Ballet has ever, or would ever put pressure on a dancer to stay with the company by threatening to have their visa removed is categorically untrue. There are over 90 dancers in the company and I would hate to think that any of them were here under pressure of any kind.\" Polunin's immediate plans involve going to Georgia, with other projects on the horizon he can't talk about. He acknowledges that in order only to do projects that excite him he has to make some money. He would like to embark on a career in films, somehow mixing acting and dance. \"I think England is a good place to start \u2013 to get an acting coach and then maybe move to America.\"",

      "body": "<p>He had been compared to Nureyev and Baryshnikov by critics and was made the Royal Ballet's youngest principal dancer at 19. Then he stunned the dance world by quitting a week before he was due to appear on stage.</p> <p>Now, in an interview with the Guardian, the Ukrainian Sergei Polunin has revealed that the gruelling demands of ballet, the boredom of rehearsals and a hankering for a more normal life mean that he intends to give up dance entirely by the time he is 26.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/25/royal-ballet-shocked-sergei-polunin\" title=\"\">By quitting the Royal Ballet in January,</a> Polunin, now 22, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/02/sergei-polunin-loses-right-work\" title=\"\">lost his right to work in the UK</a>, but he is back with a new visa that doesn't tie him to a specific company, and is about to dance in <a href=\"http://www.sadlerswells.com/show/Ivan-Putrov-Sergei-Polunin-Men-in-Motion\" title=\"\">Men in Motion</a>, a celebration of male ballet, with his friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/15/ballet-men-step-out-shadows\" title=\"\">Ivan Putrov</a>.</p> <p>Polunin and Putrov sit in a harshly lit meeting room backstage after rehearsals at Sadler's Wells in London, where the show will be staged this month, its second outing after a run at the end of January. Putrov has clearly decided to take the role of elder brother, and starts the interview by announcing that Polunin will not discuss why he left the Royal Ballet. But it doesn't take long for Polunin to reveal attitudes which make the reasons for his departure clear.</p> <p>Performing is the only time he really enjoys dancing, he says. Rehearsing is \"very hard physical work and it can sometimes be very boring as well, learning stuff. You stop rehearsing at 8pm, by the time you come home it's 10 and then it's like: 'OK, I want to have at least six hours of normal life, just watching TV,' and the next morning it's just harder to wake up.\"</p> <p>He says he wishes ballet companies would do a month of rehearsal and then 30 performances of the same show, \"so you're just enjoying being on stage \u2013 not rehearse for a month then have one show, rehearse for another month and change the show. What's the point?\"</p> <p>\"So you would repeat a show 30 times?\" asks a baffled Putrov.</p> <p>\"I would not mind,\" says Polunin. \"I would not mind just waking up, knowing I have seven hours before a show, doing [a dance] I already know, and then doing my own thing.</p> <p>\"After a show you can't sleep for about seven, eight, nine hours and you think: 'I can't sleep anyway \u2013 I may as well just use [the time],'\" says Polunin.</p> <p>A few weeks before he left the Royal Ballet, Polunin's nocturnal activities raised some eyebrows. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/sergei_polunin/status/155939337043836928\" title=\"\">tweeted a photograph of himself with his feet up</a>, drinking from a can of Kronenbourg at 9.40am; another asked: \"Does anybody sell heroin? Need to bring my mood up.\"</p> <p>Of course it was a joke, but the Royal Ballet were unimpressed.</p> <p>\"They straight away told me off, because three people called in and complained,\" says Polunin. \"Not fans, critics. I was like, come on.\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/sergei_polunin/status/145981405023838208\" title=\"\">The tweet remains undeleted to this day.</a></p> <p>Polunin says he wants to stop dancing at 26: \"I don't think I'd enjoy going against the body.\"</p> <p>Underlining how harsh the physical effects of ballet can be, he says the body starts deteriorating from the age of 24. \"Your feet and your knees \u2026 everything starts to hurt more.\"</p> <p>The dancer says he used to watch films like Goodfellas and The Godfather before performing at Covent Garden to keep his mind off things. Men in Motion includes the first dance he has ever choreographed, a piece about James Dean.</p> <p>\"I love movies and there's something close to me about James Dean \u2013 I always wanted to do choreography on him,\" says Polunin.</p> <p>\"First of all I saw James Franco play James Dean [<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240628/\" title=\"\">in a 2001 TV movie</a>] and I loved the character, the way he impersonated him. I went and got a tattoo of James Dean on my shoulder without actually seeing him in any movies.\"</p> <p>Tattoos spell freedom to Polunin. The subject makes his eyes light up; suddenly he sits up straight and stops fiddling with the chain around his neck. \"When I was a kid I always liked scratching myself \u2013 making shapes, making drawings, and I always thought I would have a tattoo,\" he says.</p> <p>He is part-owner of <a href=\"http://www.londontattoocompany.co.uk/\" title=\"\">a tattoo parlour in London's Holloway Road</a>, near his home, and went there to spend the night after leaving the Royal Ballet. It is his sanctuary from the regimented world of dance. The tattooists, he says, are \"normal people, from the streets, it's kind of gangster. They can do anything while they're tattooing: they can drink, they can smoke, all of them are free.\"</p> <p>Polunin says that hanging out there reminds him of spending time in amusement arcades as a child with his friends. He is from a poor background in Kherson, a remote town in Ukraine, and was pushed into dance by his parents in the hope that it would bring the family a better life. Having attained a scholarship to the Royal Ballet at the age of 13, it's easy to see how Polunin would have missed the camaraderie of his peers, and how he found it again at the tattooists.</p> <p>He says he envies people with tattoos on their faces or hands: they are, he believes, \"free people because they're not attached to anything \u2013 it means their job allows them to have this tattoo.\"</p> <p>However, rumours that Polunin will learn the craft himself are wide of the mark: \"It's a hard type of art to learn \u2013 you have to be able to draw.\"</p> <p>Polunin is cagey about what he would like to do next. \"I'd love to guest with an Arabic company and America always looked good,\" he says. \"In my head I want to do dancing as a hobby.

      "bodyText": "The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, has warned critics of Barack Obama's Iran policy not to mistake a willingness to pursue diplomacy for weakness. Panetta, speaking to a largely sceptical audience at the annual conference of the powerful pro-Israel lobby in Washington, derided the aggressive posturing of some of the president's opponents and more hawkish supporters of Israel, who have pressed for an explicit commitment to the use of force against Iran by setting \"red lines\" that Tehran's nuclear programme must not cross. Panetta said the military option is on the table as a last resort if sanctions fail, and the president's record demonstrates he will use it if he believes there is no alternative. \"As the president made clear, the United States does not bluff. In this town it's easy to talk tough. Acting tough is a hell of a lot more important,\" he told the the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) conference. \"The president ordered 30,000 additional troops to battle in Afghanistan to confront a resurgent Taliban. He launched a comprehensive precision bombing campaign to protect the Libyans and ultimately toppled a brutal dictator. He has ordered US warships to pass through the straits of Hormuz \u2013 despite the threats that we have received from Iran. \"And he has been the driving force behind the most successful and lethal counter-terrorism campaign in US history, culminating in the bold decision to send US special operations forces hundreds of miles into Pakistan to take the risk to take down Bin Laden. And he did.\" Panetta's speech was a clear rebuke to other speakers at Aipac, including three of the four Republican presidential candidates who also addressed the conference on Tuesday. Ron Paul was not invited following his calls to cut off aid to Israel, along with every other country, and because of his criticism that sanctions on Iran are driving it toward developing a nuclear weapon. The other candidates also came out swinging against Obama's Iran strategy. Mitt Romney called Obama's policy of \"engagement\" with Tehran naive, and said it gave the Iranian leadership time to develop its nuclear programme. \"Hope is not a foreign policy. The only thing respected by thugs and tyrants is our resolve backed by our power and our readiness to use it,\" he said. \"In recent days and weeks we've heard a lot of words from the administration. Its clear message has been to warn Israel to consider the costs of military action against Iran. I don't believe we should be issuing public warnings that create distance between the United States and Israel.\" But in the end, Romney's position was not so far from Obama's. \"I will bring the current policy of procrastination toward Iran to an end. I will not delay in imposing further crippling sanctions,\" he said. \"As president I'll be ready to engage in diplomacy but I will be just as ready to engage our military might.\" Newt Gingrich, also speaking via video link, went furthest in saying that as president he would give Israel the means to attack Tehran's nuclear facilities and let it do so without question. \"I will initiate a strategy in the tradition of Reagan, Thatcher and Pope John Paul II to undermine and replace the Iranian dictatorship by every possible method short of war in order to achieve a government we could trust and could deal with,\" he said. \"At the same time I would provide all available intelligence to the Israeli government, ensure that they had the equipment necessary and reassure them that if an Israeli prime minister decides he has to avoid the threat of a second Holocaust through preemptive measures that I would require no advance notice to understand why I would support the right of Israel to survive in a dangerous world.\" Rick Santorum was the only candidate to appear in person at Aipac. \"As I've sat and watched this play out on the world stage I've seen a president who has been reticent. He says he has Israel's back. From everything I've seen from the conduct of this administration, he's turned his back on the people of Israel,\" Santorum said to applause. He accused Obama of appeasement over today's news that the US will join Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany in a fresh round of negotiations with Iran. \"Another appeasement, another delay. Another opportunity for them [Iran] to go forward while we talk,\" he said. Santorum \u2013 breaking with the tradition that the president's opponents do not generally side with other powers on the question of foreign policy \u2013 said there was a \"tragic disconnect\" between how Obama and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, viewed the urgency of the situation. \"We need to set forth a clear ultimatum to the Iranian government. We need to say to the Iranian government: the time is now \u2013 you will stop your nuclear production now, you will open up your facilities for inspectors from the United States ad other countries so we can certify that those efforts are stopping and being dismantled, now,\" he said to strong applause from the Aipac audience. \"We need to put that ultimatum in place and we need to be prepared if that ultimatum is not met \u2026 that if they don't tear down those facilities, we will tear down them ourselves.\" The Republican candidate also had stinging criticism for the US military chief, General Martin Dempsey, who called Iran a \"rational actor\". \"Rational actors don't call for the destruction of other states, call them cancers, preach radical theologies,\" he said. \"Rational actors do not develop nuclear capability, calling for nuclear power, when they have hundreds of years of oil and gas to provide for their power and their medical research.\" Romney broke with the focus on Iran to mention the Palestinians \u2013 who have been virtually invisible as an issue at this Aipac conference to the gratification of the Israeli government \u2013 although his comments will have brought them little comfort. \"The current administration has distanced itself from Israel and visibly warmed to the Palestinian cause. It's emboldened the Palestinians. They're convinced that they can do better with America directly than they can at the bargaining table with Israel,\" he said. Romney took a stab at Obama's assertion last year that a two-state solution will be based on the 1967 armistice lines with land swaps \u2013 a statement long accepted as the basis of a deal but which brought a torrent of accusations from the Republican right and some of Israel's more militant supporters that he was selling out the Jewish state. \"I've seen Israel by land and by air. I've seen its narrow waist and its vulnerability,\" said Romney. \"I would never call for a return to the indefensible '67 lines because I understand that, in Israel, geography is security.\"",

      "bodyText": "At the Liberal Democrat spring conference last year in Sheffield a detailed amendment to a motion on the health and social care bill was passed by the conference. I was a co-sponsor of that amendment. What follows is an analysis of the motion and the degree to which its requirements have been met and what amendments to the bill could have been made to deliver on that motion more fully. (These amendments are given in full in an appendix at the end of this post.) The Lib Dem amendment (with my comments indented): Conference recognises however that all of the above policies and aspirations can be achieved without adopting the damaging and unjustified market-based approach that is proposed. Conference regrets that some of the proposed reforms have never been Liberal Democrat policy, did not feature in our manifesto or in the agreed Coalition Programme, which instead called for an end to large-scale top-down re-organisations. Conference therefore calls on Liberal Democrats in Parliament to amend the Health Bill to provide for: I) More democratically accountable commissioning. This is not delivered via clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), but could be delivered if health and wellbeing boards (HWBs) were more democratic and they, and the local authority overview and scrutiny function, could hold CCGs to account democratically by \u2026 \u2022 Amendment (A) to ensure that the voting members of HWBs are elected or that a majority of the HWB are elected representatives. \u2022 Amendment (B) to ensure that disputes between HWBs and CCGs are ultimately resolved in favour of the democratic body or by a democratically accountable arbitrator. \u2022 Amendment (C) to ensure that where the local authority overview and scrutiny function disputes a decision of a CCG the matter is referred to an elected person or body (eg the Secretary of State) for resolution and not a quango. II) A much greater degree of coterminosity between local authorities and commissioning areas. Not delivered. There is only a non-statutory declaration of a \"presumption\" of coterminosity. This could be delivered by amendment (D) which provided that affected HWBs and local authorities need to approve non-coterminous CCGs III) No decision about the spending of NHS funds to be made in private and without proper consultation, as can take place by the proposed GP consortia. Delivered IV) The complete ruling out of any competition based on price to prevent loss-leading corporate providers under-cutting NHS tariffs, and to ensure that healthcare providers 'compete' on quality of care. Delivered V) New private providers to be allowed only where there is no risk of 'cherry-picking' which would destabilise or undermine the existing NHS service relied upon for emergencies and complex cases, and where the needs of equity, research and training are met. Not delivered. This could be delivered by amendment (E) placing duty on CCGs, NHS Commissioning Board (NCB), Monitor and the Care Quality Commission to act with a view to ensuring that remaining and essential services are not destabilised by a loss of income or of clinical caseload VI) NHS commissioning being retained as a public function in full compliance with the Human Rights Act and Freedom of Information laws, using the skills and experience of existing NHS staff rather than the sub-contracting of commissioning to private companies. Not delivered. Needs an amendment (F) to ban the WHOLESALE outsourcing of commissioning support to non-pubic sector bodies VII) The continued separation of the commissioning and provision of services to prevent conflicts of interests. Delivered VIII) An NHS, responsive to patients' needs, based on co-operation rather than competition, and which promotes quality and equity not the market. Not delivered Needs amendments (G) to stop competition/choice being pursued by commissioners at the expense of equity of access and equality of outcome by raising the duty on CCGs and the NCB to tackle inequity and inequality to the \"act with a view to\" level and reduce the duty on CCGs and the NCB to promote innovation and enable choice to the \"have regard for the need to\" level And needs further amendments (H) to make Monitor a balanced regulator by \u2022 including \"anti-collaborative\" as well as \"anti-competitive\" practices which go against the patient's interests as those which need to be prevented \u2013 clause 61 \u2022 similar amendments to clause 73 and 97 \u2022 give Monitor enforcement powers on its duty to secure integration (as well as duties around competition) \u2013 clause 73 There have been a number of amendments to the bill which improve it in other areas, but the above eight were specifically required by the Lib Dem Conference. And in summary, of the eight broad (or in some cases narrow) \"asks\" three have been delivered and five have not. On that basis, assuming no changes are made to the bill, I advise Liberal Democrat party activists at the forthcoming Spring Conference to call for the bill to be dropped. ************************************************************ Appendix For the anoraks reading this science blog (there must be a few) these are the amendments I knocked out in an afternoon to deliver these changes - these amendments are to the current version of the bill as it left the Lords' Committee stage.

      "bodyText": "On the screen an awestruck Nicole Kidman stares down at Rio's spectacular, undulating mountains from the comfort of an executive jet. She steps onto the tarmac and is ushered into a stretch limousine. It carries her through the sun-kissed streets of this seaside city, past the Sugar Loaf mountain and along Ipanema beach to the seductive beat of a bossa nova. Finally, Kidman emerges from the car and sweeps down a green carpet in a skin-tight red ballgown, surrounded by paparazzi. Her destination? Rio's Village Mall, a R$350m (\u00a3125m) luxury shopping centre being erected in Barra da Tijuca, a rapidly growing neighbourhood in the city's west zone. \"The Village Mall is the shopping centre Rio de Janeiro was waiting for,\" gushes the voiceover on the glamorous television commercial, for which Kidman was reportedly paid some R$400,000. Set to open later this year, the mall is only the latest symbol of Brazil's commodity-fuelled boom which on Tuesday helped the country overtake the UK as the world's 6th largest economy. Multiplan, the company behind the shopping centre \u2013 which will boast four VIP lounges and six state of the art cinemas \u2013 claims it will exemplify \"Rio Chic\". On Tuesday, as sweat-drenched workers in blue uniforms clambered over the complex's colossal concrete shell and giant cranes hauled steel columns into place it became yet another indication of Brazil's arrival onto the world stage. While growth slowed in 2011, down from 7.5% in 2010 to 2.7%, that was still enough to help this booming South American nation leap-frog the UK, another step on the path towards global economic and political greatness. Speaking in Hanover, Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff captured the public mood declaring her country \"the land of opportunities\". It was just one of many superlatives currently being heaped on Brazil and in particular Rio de Janeiro, a city politicians say is being \"reborn\". Increasingly it feels like one giant construction site with luxury condominiums, shopping centres and office blocks springing up across town and cranes dotting the horizon. Hardly a day goes by without reports in the local press of Brazilians flocking home in search of a piece of the boom, or crisis-hit Europeans turning up in droves seeking job opportunities. One recent article in the news magazine Veja claimed that of the 200,000 professionals who had abandoned Rio's stagnant economy between 1980 and 2000, 70% had returned home since 2009. The magazine attributed the reversal to three factors: a fledgling oil boom off the Rio coastline, the upcoming 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics and improved security. In total, Veja said some R$181.4bn would be invested in the local economy between now and 2015. The magazine claimed that represented an average investment of R$4.17m per square metre \u2014 \"the highest concentration of resources in the world.\" Among those to have returned is Marcelo Haddad, the executive director of Rio Negocios, the city's newly created investment agency. Like many local businessmen and financial workers Haddad spent much of the last two decades in Sao Paulo but came back three years ago lured by an explosion of investment in Brazil's former capital. \"Since I have come back I have seen so much energy, so much motivation to make things happen... and I think that in the future Rio will be even more attractive than it is now,\" said Haddad, 50, a Harvard graduate and former HSBC employee who came back to Rio to head a project revitalizing the city's port. \"We have always been dreamers, we have always had a vision but now we are achieving that vision,\" he said. \"I feel very proud to come back to Rio to work. It's a very special moment. We are getting a lot of talent back.\" Claudio Bruni, the CEO of BR Properties, Brazil's biggest commercial real-estate company, is also smiling. His company is pushing ahead with ambitious plans to build and remodel offices in Rio for foreign and Brazilian companies, many of them linked to the oil boom. Bruni's latest project saw an abandoned 12-storey Oscar Niemeyer building restored, modernized and rented to BP and the Norwegian oil company Statoil. Bruni said Rio's market for office space was booming as the city was becoming \"one of the greatest oil centres in the world.\" \"Today our best quality properties and those with the highest prices are in Rio \u2026 because of the great demand. We are excited and looking to make more investments.\" Foreign businessmen and politicians are also lining up for a slice. \"This is a visit I've been looking forward to for a very long time,\" the foreign secretary William Hague told the Guardian during a visit to Rio earlier this year, intended, he said, to show the UK's \"desire to intensify relations with Brazil\". Challenges remain despite the superlatives. While security has improved, much of Rio remains off-limits to outsiders with heavily armed gangs still controlling many of the city's slums. Murder rates have dropped but remain startling high in many corners of the city. Poverty persists. A study released last month by Brazil's Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, found that while the number of people living in absolute poverty has declined from about 4% of the population in 2001, to round 2.2% now, some 351,000 people in Rio state were still surviving on less than $2 a day in a state of 15.9m people. But the overall mood is one of optimism. \"It's a very interesting time,\" said Haddad, the head of Rio's investment agency. \"Rio is facing one of the brightest and most attractive moments [in its history].\" Asked if he regretted returning to the city where he was born, Haddad, a native of Copacabana, laughed. \"Absolutely not.\"",

      "body": "<p>On the screen an awestruck Nicole Kidman stares down at Rio's spectacular, undulating mountains from the comfort of an executive jet.</p> <p>She steps onto the tarmac and is ushered into a stretch limousine. It carries her through the sun-kissed streets of this seaside city, past the Sugar Loaf mountain and along Ipanema beach to the seductive beat of a bossa nova.</p> <p>Finally, Kidman emerges from the car and sweeps down a green carpet in a skin-tight red ballgown, surrounded by paparazzi. Her destination? <a href=\"http://www.webluxo.com.br/menu/negocios/10/shopping-villagemall-rio.htm\" title=\"\">Rio's Village Mall</a>, a R$350m (\u00a3125m) luxury shopping centre being erected in Barra da Tijuca, a rapidly growing neighbourhood in the city's west zone.</p> <p>\"The Village Mall is the shopping centre Rio de Janeiro was waiting for,\" gushes the voiceover on the glamorous television commercial, for which Kidman was reportedly paid some R$400,000.</p> <p>Set to open later this year, the mall is only the latest symbol of Brazil's commodity-fuelled boom which on Tuesday helped the country overtake the UK as the world's 6th largest economy.</p> <p>Multiplan, the company behind the shopping centre \u2013 which will boast four VIP lounges and six state of the art cinemas \u2013 claims it will exemplify \"Rio Chic\". On Tuesday, as sweat-drenched workers in blue uniforms clambered over the complex's colossal concrete shell and giant cranes hauled steel columns into place it became yet another indication of Brazil's arrival onto the world stage.</p> <p>While growth slowed in 2011, down from 7.5% in 2010 to 2.7%, that was still enough to help this booming South American nation leap-frog the UK, another step on the path towards global economic and political greatness.</p> <p>Speaking in Hanover, Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff captured the public mood declaring her country \"the land of opportunities\".</p> <p>It was just one of many superlatives currently being heaped on Brazil and in particular Rio de Janeiro, a city politicians say is being \"reborn\". Increasingly it feels like one giant construction site with luxury condominiums, shopping centres and office blocks springing up across town and cranes dotting the horizon.</p> <p>Hardly a day goes by without reports in the local press of Brazilians flocking home in search of a piece of the boom, or crisis-hit Europeans turning up in droves seeking job opportunities.</p> <p>One recent article in the news magazine Veja claimed that of the 200,000 professionals who had abandoned Rio's stagnant economy between 1980 and 2000, 70% had returned home since 2009. The magazine attributed the reversal to three factors: a fledgling oil boom off the Rio coastline, the upcoming 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics and improved security. In total, Veja said some R$181.4bn would be invested in the local economy between now and 2015. The magazine claimed that represented an average investment of R$4.17m per square metre \u2014 \"the highest concentration of resources in the world.\"</p> <p>Among those to have returned is Marcelo Haddad, the executive director of Rio Negocios, the city's newly created investment agency. Like many local businessmen and financial workers Haddad spent much of the last two decades in Sao Paulo but came back three years ago lured by an explosion of investment in Brazil's former capital.</p> <p>\"Since I have come back I have seen so much energy, so much motivation to make things happen... and I think that in the future Rio will be even more attractive than it is now,\" said Haddad, 50, a Harvard graduate and former HSBC employee who came back to Rio to head a project revitalizing the city's port.</p> <p>\"We have always been dreamers, we have always had a vision but now we are achieving that vision,\" he said. \"I feel very proud to come back to Rio to work. It's a very special moment. We are getting a lot of talent back.\"</p> <p>Claudio Bruni, the CEO of BR Properties, Brazil's biggest commercial real-estate company, is also smiling. His company is pushing ahead with ambitious plans to build and remodel offices in Rio for foreign and Brazilian companies, many of them linked to the oil boom. Bruni's latest project saw an abandoned 12-storey Oscar Niemeyer building restored, modernized and rented to BP and the Norwegian oil company Statoil.</p> <p>Bruni said Rio's market for office space was booming as the city was becoming \"one of the greatest oil centres in the world.\" \"Today our best quality properties and those with the highest prices are in Rio \u2026 because of the great demand. We are excited and looking to make more investments.\"</p> <p>Foreign businessmen and politicians are also lining up for a slice.</p> <p>\"This is a visit I've been looking forward to for a very long time,\" the foreign secretary William Hague told the Guardian during a visit to Rio earlier this year, intended, he said, to show the UK's \"desire to intensify relations with Brazil\".</p> <p>Challenges remain despite the superlatives. While security has improved, much of Rio remains off-limits to outsiders with heavily armed gangs still controlling many of the city's slums. Murder rates have dropped but remain startling high in many corners of the city.</p> <p>Poverty persists. A study released last month by Brazil's Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, found that while the number of people living in absolute poverty has declined from about 4% of the population in 2001, to round 2.2% now, some 351,000 people in Rio state were still surviving on less than $2 a day in a state of 15.9m people.</p> <p>But the overall mood is one of optimism. \"It's a very interesting time,\" said Haddad, the head of Rio's investment agency. \"Rio is facing one of the brightest and most attractive moments [in its history].\"</p> <p>Asked if he regretted returning to the city where he was born, Haddad, a native of Copacabana, laughed. \"Absolutely not.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Adele is closing in on 20m sales of her album 21, but the British singer has also been a big hit on Apple and Google's app stores. The official Adele app has been downloaded more than 1.5m times on iPhone and Android, according to David Emery, head of marketing at Beggars Group, the parent company of Adele's label XL Recordings. He announced the milestone at the Music Apps: Beyond the Hype conference in London. \"It's just going gangbusters, especially on Android,\" says Emery. The app was released for iPhone in September 2011, and then Android in mid-February 2012. XL used the Mobile Roadie platform to create both versions. \"Android is now overtaking the iPhone version for downloads,\" says Emery, citing promotion on the homepage of Google's Android Market as the key reason. \"They're about half and half, but the Android one has been out for less than a month.\" In terms of features, Adele's app is fairly standard \u2013 news, photos, videos, song previews and tour dates, as well as a social section for comments and photo postings. Emery says the aim was less about selling more music and tickets, than to provide \"another communication platform\" for Adele's fans, sitting alongside her own website, Facebook and Twitter. The social aspect has been incredibly popular: there's a whole set of people that use the app on an hourly basis,\" says Emery, citing stats from the app's leaderboard, which ranks fans according to their in-app activity. \"The top person has 386,000 points, and they've made 6,600 comments and 6,540 fan-wall posts. And the next person down has made almost 13,000 wall posts! It's not a big surprise though, because we've seen the same levels of engagement on Adele's website forums.\" Are there lessons to be learned from Adele's 1.5m downloads for other artists, though? The most obvious reason why the app is so popular is the phenomenal success of Adele herself, at a scale that very few artists can hope to repeat. \"I have no idea what this means for artist apps more generally, as it's such an odd outlier,\" says Emery. \"What it does say is that if you have a mainstream artist or brand and get coverage on these stores, it can really take off.\" He admits that when it comes to the rest of Beggars' roster of independent artists, the label group takes a pragmatic approach when deciding whether to invest in an app: if a band isn't at a certain scale, it may be more sensible to focus on their existing website and social media presence. \"We're working very hard on making our artist websites more mobile-friendly though,\" says Emery. \"These days, around 10-15% of visitors are coming from mobile devices, including tablets.\" That's unsurprising: as Bloomberg's mobile boss Oke Okaro explained to Apps Blog earlier in March, any mobile user who finds their way to a brand (or band) from a browser search or a link posted on Twitter or Facebook will pitch up at their website, not their native app. For now, though, Beggars will continue to use Adele's app as part of its wider communication with her fans, bridging the gap between the end of the campaign for 21, and whatever she comes up with next. One thing that isn't a huge focus for the app is selling music, even though the iTunes Store links are in there. \"Nobody's retiring off the money we've made selling tracks through Adele's app,\" says Emery. \"And when you're talking about an app that's done 1.5m downloads with the biggest-selling artist in quite some time, the fact that they're only making a little bit of money selling tracks tells you this is primarily a communication platform.\"",

The choice of a law school was a curious place for discussion of authoritarian powers. Obama has replaced the constitutional protections afforded to citizens with a \"trust me\" pledge that Holder repeated Monday at Northwestern. The good news is that Holder promised not to hunt citizens for sport. Holder proclaimed that: \"The president may use force abroad against a senior operational leader of a foreign terrorist organization with which the United States is at war \u2013 even if that individual happens to be a US citizen.\" The use of the word \"abroad\" is interesting since senior administration officials have asserted that the president may kill an American anywhere and anytime, including in the United States. Holder's speech does not materially limit that claimed authority. He merely assures citizens that Obama will only kill those of us he finds abroad and a significant threat. Notably, Holder added, \"Our legal authority is not limited to the battlefields in Afghanistan.\" The Obama administration continues to stonewall efforts to get it to acknowledge the existence of a memo authorizing the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki. Democrats previously demanded the \"torture memos\" of the Bush administration that revealed both poor legal analysis by Judge Jay Bybee and Professor John Yoo to justify torture. Now, however, Democrats are largely silent in the face of a president claiming the right to unilaterally kill citizens. Holder became particularly cryptic in his assurance of caution in the use of this power, insisting that they will kill citizens only with \"the consent of the nation involved or after a determination that the nation is unable or unwilling to deal effectively with a threat to the United States.\" What on earth does that mean?

Simpson Miller said Jamaica's people should take full charge of their destiny and replace the Queen with a home-grown head of state, severing ties with the British monarchy. However, she gave no timescale for any referendum. Simpson Miller also suggested that Britain might want to apologise for the \"wicked and brutal\" years of slavery. \"No race should have been subjected to what our ancestors were subjected to,\" she said in an interview with the BBC. \"We gained our freedom through the sweat, blood and tears of our ancestors and we are now free. If Britain wishes to apologise, fine with us, no problem at all.\" Her comments came just hours before the arrival of Prince Harry, who is representing his grandmother, the Queen, on a tour of Belize, the Bahamas, and Jamaica. The third in line to the British throne, later met Simpson Miller at a private lunch reception. If that encounter had required the 27-year-old prince to employ some diplomatic tip-toeing, he was earlier given the perfect opportunity to practice dextrous footwork of a different kind \u2013 a race against Usain Bolt, the world's fastest man. Prince Harry took on the Olympic 100m and 200m champion at the University of the West Indies track in Kingston, and showed him a clean pair of heels after jumping the start gun. \"He cheated,\" said the world record-holding sprinter as the two struck his trademark \"lightning bolt\" pose for the cameras. Bolt later tweeted: \"Good Jamaican vibes hanging with the Prince Harry \u2026 See you at the Olympics.\" Jamaica is the final stop on the prince's week-long tour. Given Simpson Miller's sentiments, could it be the final visit by a member of the royal family as representative of the head of state? \"I am not going to say that,\" she said. \"Even if the Queen does not remain head of state the Queen at any time will be welcome to visit. \"It's not about getting rid of the Queen \u2013 who could get rid of the Queen? She is a wonderful, beautiful lady. The decision to become a republic shouldn't be taken in the context of us wanting to get rid of the Queen.\" But, she added, as Jamaica prepares to celebrate 50 years of independence in August, it was an appropriate time in our history to be looking at changes.",

However, she gave no timescale for any referendum.</p> <p>Simpson Miller also suggested that Britain might want to apologise for the \"wicked and brutal\" years of slavery.</p> <p>\"No race should have been subjected to what our ancestors were subjected to,\" she said in an interview with the BBC. \"We gained our freedom through the sweat, blood and tears of our ancestors and we are now free. If Britain wishes to apologise, fine with us, no problem at all.\"</p> <p>Her comments came just hours before the arrival of Prince Harry, who is representing his grandmother, the Queen, on a tour of Belize, the Bahamas, and Jamaica. The third in line to the British throne, later met Simpson Miller at a private lunch reception.</p> <p>If that encounter had required the 27-year-old prince to employ some diplomatic tip-toeing, he was earlier given the perfect opportunity to practice dextrous footwork of a different kind \u2013 a&#xa0;race against Usain Bolt, the world's fastest man.</p> <p>Prince Harry took on the Olympic 100m and 200m champion at the University of the West Indies track in Kingston, and showed him a clean pair of heels after jumping the start gun. \"He cheated,\" said the world record-holding sprinter as the two struck his trademark \"lightning bolt\" pose for the cameras.</p> <p>Bolt later tweeted: \"Good Jamaican vibes hanging with the Prince Harry \u2026 See you at the Olympics.\"</p> <p>Jamaica is the final stop on the prince's week-long tour. Given Simpson Miller's sentiments, could it be the final visit by a member of the royal family as representative of the head of state?</p> <p>\"I am not going to say that,\" she said. \"Even if the Queen does not remain head of state the Queen at any time will be welcome to visit.</p> <p>\"It's not about getting rid of the Queen \u2013 who could get rid of the Queen? She is a wonderful, beautiful lady. The decision to become a republic shouldn't be taken in the context of us wanting to get rid of the Queen.\"</p> <p>But, she added, as Jamaica prepares to celebrate 50 years of independence in August, it was an appropriate time in our history to be looking at changes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stuart Webb was mandated to become an A4e \"customer\" under the government's Work Programme in January this year. The 40-year-old from Lincoln, having worked as a bus driver, had been unemployed for a year. As with all Work Programme participants, A4e was paid an initial \"attachment fee\" of \u00a3400 for its work with him, with the prospect of two further tranches of money if he stayed in a job for at least three months, and \"sustainment payments\", made \"every four weeks when a participant stays in work longer\", according to the Department of Work and Pensions. During his first appointment with an A4e adviser, Webb was told he would have to attend weekly two-hour sessions, titled \"structured job searches\". He expected \"an individual, tailor-made service\", but found he was \"just expected to sit in front of a computer for two hours\" in the company of about eight other people, and \"go through job sites\". His adviser's motivation, he claims, appeared to be \"to get you to fill out as many job applications as you could within a two hour period. He wasn't bothered about what you were applying for.\" On two occasions Webb was called to A4e's Lincoln offices for meetings, but the people he was meant to see were absent. One of these visits involved a round trip by foot of 90 minutes; the other, petrol and parking costs of about \u00a38. \"When you're getting \u00a3135 a fortnight, that's a lot of money,\" he told the Guardian. When he complained to the company about these experiences, their written response claimed that one member of staff was called to \"attend training on the same day\" and \"forgot to rebook\" the appointment (though there was an apology for \"the oversight\"), and that another had tried to reschedule their meeting, but had been \"unable to speak\" to him. Webb says no messages were left on either his home or mobile voicemail, and he received no emails about changing the latter appointment, either. During the fourth session, Webb found a vacancy as a carpet salesman, and was offered the job. \"I could just as easily have found it the day before or the day after on my own computer,\" he says. \"They didn't flag it or highlight it to me \u2026 There was no help from them, other than providing the computer. All they did was switch it on.\" When he told A4e staff he had been invited for an interview, \"they were really happy and cheerful, shaking my hand and patting me on the back. And I was leaving their office, I suddenly remembered that they get money when I find work: they'll say it was down to them that I got that job. And it absolutely wasn't.\" \" A4e said that some of his comments about Job Search sessions were \"entirely subjective\", and that advisers are always available to \"support individuals\" as well as helping them \"structure their job search\". They said their \"staff are always 'bothered' \", and that Webb's view of his adviser was \"disingenuous\". They also refuted the claim that A4e gave him no help. One of its staff had informed Webb of the vacancy that led to his new job, the firm claimed. Webb also received a letter notifying him of an appointment with an A4e adviser named \"Ann Other\". He says he was told that this was \"a made-up name\" A4e staff attach to appointments \"when they don't know who the appointment is with\". A4e said: \"It is not our standard practice to issue letters in the name 'Ann Other'. This is something that was done at a local level, and we are addressing it directly with the Lincoln office.\"",

      "bodyText": "The welfare-to-work company A4e was forced to withdraw from part of a \u00a3900,000 project to place vulnerable people into work after an employee forged signatures on official forms. A4e was helping to place 630 youngsters with disabilities and mental health difficulties into jobs in Teesside in a project funded with European Union money. Former colleagues said the employee invented signatures to increase the number of people who appeared to have been placed in jobs or on courses. The disclosure will add to questions concerning governance within A4e. The company, which has \u00a3180m worth of public contracts, is at the centre of a fraud investigation in Slough, where four people have been arrested. A subcontractor of A4e is also subject to an official inquiry. An inquiry into its Hull office resulted in one former employee being fined for falsifying job outcomes. On Monday, Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, told MPs she has received new allegations of fraud against the company. A spokesman for A4e said the company did not know about these allegations. In February company founder Emma Harrison, who was paid an \u00a38.6m dividend last year, resigned as an unpaid Downing Street adviser and as chairman of A4e. She denies any wrongdoing. David Cameron told the parliamentary liason committee on Tuesday that if allegations of fraud against A4e are proven and show that problems in the company are systemic, then government contracts with the company could be halted. The inquiry into forged signatures dates back to 2009 when A4e was among subcontractors working to Redcar and Cleveland borough council in the Elite Project, funded with European Social Fund cash, to help hundreds of young people who might otherwise slip through the net. They included teenage parents, those with learning difficulties and disabled people. But a council inquiry found that learners' signatures had been forged. A source close to the inquiry said: \"The fraud was obvious and was an attempt to make it look as if the individual had got more vulnerable people involved than was the case.\" A spokeswoman for A4e said the employee resigned before disciplinary action was taken. \"We would have treated this as a disciplinary matter,\" she said. There had been no financial gain and no evidence of criminal activity. \"This was a case of poor administration, nothing more,\" she said. \"The individual involved admitted that she was the only person involved in this activity and had undertaken this activity of her own volition.\" A spokesman for the council said: \"In 2010, Redcar and Cleveland council had a contract with A4e to deliver part of a programme to support young people who were not in education, employment or training. After scrutiny regarding some of this work, part of this contract was discontinued.\" Another part of A4e's contract \u2013 to evaluate the Elite project by interviewing young people \u2013 continued, sources close to the project said. In a further development, Labour accused the prime minister of misleading parliament by failing to disclose A4e was subject to a fraud inquiry when Harrison was recruited as his adviser on troubled families in December 2010. Last month, Cameron told MPs: \"At the time she [Harrison] was appointed there were no formal investigations into A4e, there was just the company's own probe into irregularities.\" The Department of Work and Pensions said in a statement that an inquiry into fraud in A4e's Hull office \u2013 first reported in the Observer in November 2009 \u2013 resulted in a successful prosecution in July 2011. A DWP official said this was a \"live case\" in 2010.Liam Byrne, the shadow cabinet office minister, called for Cameron to apologise to MPs. \"Incredibly, David Cameron is simply flat wrong. There was actually an investigation under way when he appointed Emma Harrison that was so serious that someone has been convicted. \"The government must publish all correspondence between officials and A4e so that we can start to get to the bottom of what's going on in this huge government contract.\"Downing Street has been accused of ignoring warnings that appointing Harrison as an adviser could lead to a conflict of interest. Figures released to this newspaper show that the DWP has launched nine fraud investigations since 2005 into A4e's involvement in the Labour government's Flexible New Deal scheme and has asked the company to pay back money on five occasions since 2005. There was no case to answer in three of the inquiries, and there was no evidence of systemic problems in any of them, officials said. DWP officials have told the Financial Times they warned No 10 of their concerns. Cameron told the Commons that information about alleged fraud at A4e had not been passed to ministers quickly enough and he had asked the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, to investigate. It has also emerged that A4e has been advising No 10 on value for money in privatisation, including writing a guide on contracting out.",

      "bodyText": "A4e, the welfare-to-work company, has a culture of lavish trips abroad and big-spending hospitality, several former managers at the company have told the Guardian. One person who worked there has also made allegations of expenses irregularities, claiming there was a laissez-faire attitude to claims particularly from senior staff. The allegations against the company, which holds up to \u00a3180m worth of public contracts and depends for all its UK income on government money, cover an eight-year period, and follow the resignation of its chairman and founder, Emma Harrison, two weeks ago. One former manager said that some in the company enjoyed a \"champagne culture\". \"If the marketing director wanted to take out a team of 10 marketing people for a night out you wouldn't get change out of \u00a32,000,\" the former manager said. Management conferences, another former member of staff said, have taken place in such locations as Monaco and the Spanish resort of La Manga, and each event included about 100 staff. Another former manager claimed that at the company's expense, about 25 A4e managers were taken to Paris in spring 2011, to celebrate the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) awarding the company contracts for the Work Programme. In April 2011, Emma Harrison travelled to New York to meet charities and organisations working with the city's poor and jobless. A4e managers have told the Guardian that, though Harrison's personal assistant was booked to fly economy class, Harrison herself flew business class with a member of her family. The trip was billed to the company at a cost of more than \u00a320,000, and one of Harrisons' expenses claims was for a meal in a restaurant in excess of $800 (\u00a3504). A4e said the visit was a business trip and Harrison had been accompanied by her husband \"who paid for all his own costs in full\". On the allegations about company entertaining and other staff trips abroad, A4e said it was not aware of some nights out being billed at \u00a32,000 and that the allegation was \"obviously a highly subjective observation [or] understanding\". The company confirmed that there were A4e conferences in Monaco in 2006, and La Manga in 2004, and did not deny that about 100 employees were involved. The company said that \"in some instances, these conferences included frontline staff for whom the trip was part of our rewards scheme to thank them for dedicated work throughout the year\". During the three-year period when the foreign trips took place, among other work it obtained from government, A4e was given public contracts to work with incapacity benefit claimants, to run Labour's New Deal programme for the unemployed, and to administer education in prisons. \"It is hardly unusual for businesses to hold off-site conferences,\" A4e said, \"but please be aware that previous and subsequent conferences have been held in locations including Rotherham and Manchester.\" The staff visit to Paris \"was a 24-hour trip, and centred on an annual conference \u2013 the focus of which was on supporting the French side of the business who were undertaking a major tender round\". It was not, the firm said, \"a celebration, and to suggest otherwise is entirely erroneous\". The Guardian has also seen a dossier compiled by Russell Kynoch, a former Jobcentre Plus employee. An unemployed A4e client, he was given a four-week work experience placement in the finance department of A4e's Sheffield offices from 23 January to 17 February this year, funded by a government training allowance with the same value as jobseeker's allowance. Kynoch processed pre-authorised expenses claims from across the company. He said he came across numerous irregularities including \"missing receipts for taxi, rail, bus, train, tram, parking and wrong calculations of payments\". He saw claims for travel expenses that were not backed up with receipts, and others which contravened company rules. He was told, he said, to \"not spend a lot of time scrutinising every [expenses] claim and with each expenses invoice\", and with any claim, to \"only examine a couple of receipts\". He said: \"I would get a claim with 15 or 20 receipts. I was told to just pick a couple out \u2026 [They said] 'Don't spend time going through every receipt with the form.'\" He saw \"lavish wine and dine bills\", mostly from staff based in London.

The company added: \"Our expenses are in line with any private business, and our accounts are fully audited by independent auditors.\" Kynoch has raised concerns about what he saw with senior figures, including chief executive Andrew Dutton. Though Emma Harrison has not replied to an email detailing the alleged abuses, Kynoch has had an email assuring him that the company \"takes these matters very seriously\". This and another email, signed by Dutton, refer to A4e's appointment of law firm White &amp; Case to review internal controls and processes, a move made after Harrison's resignation. Dutton's email assures Kynoch that \"internal processes, such as the expenses process, will form part of that audit\". A4e told the Guardian: \"As a responsible business we would take any allegations of incorrect expenses claims very seriously and investigate thoroughly, including taking relevant disciplinary action if appropriate.\"",

      "body": "<p>A4e, the welfare-to-work company, has a culture of lavish trips abroad and big-spending hospitality, several former managers at the company have told the Guardian.</p> <p>One person who worked there has also made allegations of expenses irregularities, claiming there was a laissez-faire attitude to claims particularly from senior staff.</p> <p>The allegations against the company, which holds up to \u00a3180m worth of public contracts and depends for all its UK income on government money, cover an eight-year period, and follow the resignation of its chairman and founder, Emma Harrison, two weeks ago.</p> <p>One former manager said that some in the company enjoyed a \"champagne culture\".</p> <p>\"If the marketing director wanted to take out a team of 10 marketing people for a night out you wouldn't get change out of \u00a32,000,\" the former manager said.</p> <p>Management conferences, another former member of staff said, have taken place in such locations as Monaco and the Spanish resort of La Manga, and each event included about 100 staff. Another former manager claimed that at the company's expense, about 25 A4e managers were taken to Paris in spring 2011, to celebrate the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) awarding the company contracts for the Work Programme.</p> <p>In April 2011, Emma Harrison travelled to New York to meet charities and organisations working with the city's poor and jobless. A4e managers have told the Guardian that, though Harrison's personal assistant was booked to fly economy class, Harrison herself flew business class with a member of her family. The trip was billed to the company at a cost of more than \u00a320,000, and one of Harrisons' expenses claims was for a meal in a restaurant in excess of $800 (\u00a3504). A4e said the visit was a business trip and Harrison had been accompanied by her husband \"who paid for all his own costs in full\".</p> <p>On the allegations about company entertaining and other staff trips abroad, A4e said it was not aware of some nights out being billed at \u00a32,000 and that the allegation was \"obviously a highly subjective observation [or] understanding\".</p> <p>The company confirmed that there were A4e conferences in Monaco in 2006, and La Manga in 2004, and did not deny that about 100 employees were involved. The company said that \"in some instances, these conferences included frontline staff for whom the trip was part of our rewards scheme to thank them for&#xa0;dedicated work throughout the year\".</p> <p>During the three-year period when the foreign trips took place, among other work it obtained from government, A4e was given public contracts to work with incapacity benefit claimants, to run Labour's New Deal programme for the unemployed, and to administer education in prisons.</p> <p>\"It is hardly unusual for businesses to hold off-site conferences,\" A4e said, \"but please be aware that previous and subsequent conferences have been held in locations including Rotherham and Manchester.\"</p> <p>The staff visit to Paris \"was a 24-hour trip, and centred on an annual conference \u2013 the focus of which was on supporting the French side of the business who were undertaking a major tender round\". It was not, the firm said, \"a celebration, and to suggest otherwise is entirely erroneous\".</p> <p>The Guardian has also seen a dossier compiled by Russell Kynoch, a former Jobcentre Plus employee. An unemployed A4e client, he was given a four-week work experience placement in the finance department of A4e's Sheffield offices from 23 January to 17 February this year, funded by a government training allowance with the same value as jobseeker's allowance.</p> <p>Kynoch processed pre-authorised expenses claims from across the company. He said he came across numerous irregularities including \"missing receipts for taxi, rail, bus, train, tram, parking and wrong calculations of payments\".</p> <p>He saw claims for travel expenses that were not backed up with receipts, and others which contravened company rules.</p> <p>He was told, he said, to \"not spend a lot of time scrutinising every [expenses] claim and with each expenses invoice\", and with any claim, to \"only examine a couple of receipts\". He said: \"I would get a claim with 15 or 20 receipts. I was told to just pick a couple out \u2026 [They said] 'Don't spend time going through every receipt with the form.'\"</p> <p>He saw \"lavish wine and dine bills\", mostly from staff based in London.</p> <p>A4e said the claims were \"entirely subjective\" and that \"without any evidence to support them\" besides Kynoch's account, the company could not be expected to comment on them directly.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has tried to regain the initiative on the NHS by pledging \u00a3336.5m to build new emergency units, help a major hospital cope with the booming birthrate and buy extra scanners. \"Millions\" of patients would benefit and thousands of lives would be saved as a result of the cash injection, including newborn babies and women having screening for breast cancer, the prime minister said. The money would also pay for new operating theatres and improvements to community hospitals. The North West London Hospitals NHS trust will get \u00a320.8m for a new A&amp;E department and new diagnostic equipment, while the maternity unit at Birmingham Women's Hospital \u2013 one of England's busiest for births \u2013 will be extended, and new induction and recover suites added at a cost of \u00a33.2m. The money is for \"new medical equipment, from CT scanners to cancer therapy and neonatal care facilities\", said Cameron. \"It will ensure millions of people see better buildings, better equipment and brand new facilities and equipment as well as saving thousands of lives,\" he added. The Department of Health said the money represented \"extra\" spending on capital projects and had become available after savings had been made elsewhere in its budget, including to the troubled NHS IT programme. It had confirmed in January that hospitals could bid for \u00a3300m of unexpected funding for capital projects . Unusually, hospitals will start receiving the money right away, with the rest coming in the new financial year. The money will also pay for: \u2022 New urgent care centres at Burnley hospital (\u00a39m); Hillingdon, west London (\u00a312.4m); and an upgrade to the existing urgent care centre at St Helier, south London (\u00a35.5m) to help take the pressure off local A&amp;E units. \u2022 A new paediatric facility at Scarborough general hospital (\u00a326.7m), which will let it look after 5,000 paediatric inpatients and 4,500 outpatients each year. \u2022 Redevelopment of community hospitals in Bridgwater, Somerset (\u00a316m); Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire (\u00a312m); Purley, Surrey (\u00a312m); and Surbiton, south-west London (\u00a35.2m). \u2022 Improved breast cancer screening equipment to enable more women in Hackney and Newham, east London, to undergo screening (\u00a31.1m). \u2022 New CT scanners for hospitals in Dorset (\u00a31.9m), East Sussex (\u00a31.2m) and Newham (\u00a3700k). Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, claimed the \u00a3336.5m showed how the government's drive to be more efficient would benefit patients. The projects \"will help over two and a half million patients per year\", he said. \"This investment will mean that old facilities are revamped, there is more world-class equipment in NHS hospitals and more patients get the scans and treatment that they need.\" Labour declined to criticise the move. Instead it contrasted the announcement with the \u00a33bn estimated cost of implementing the coalition's radical restructuring of the NHS. \"The government's damaging and unnecessary NHS reorganisation is wasting over \u00a33bn and causing ministers to lose their grip on the health service. Patients are beginning to pay the price of David Cameron's reckless reorganisation as waiting lists rise, services are cut and thousands of nursing jobs are axed,\" said shadow health minister Jamie Reed. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 April 2012.

      "bodyText": "Ed Miliband has called for a new patriotic economic policy to give British firms a better chance of competing with their foreign rivals. Setting out Labour's industry policy in a speech to the Engineering Employers Federation, the party leader said successive administrations had failed to grasp how important \"pride and patriotism\" were to ensuring the country's manufacturing sector can thrive and create jobs for the economy. The Labour leader argued that supporting British firms was crucial to jobs and growth in the UK. \"We should not be embarrassed about the need for more patriotism in our economic policy,\" he said. He accused the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition of letting British business down by sticking to the view that government should \"get out of the way\" amid recent anger at the way thousands of jobs at Canadian-owned Bombardier in Derby were put on the line after an important contract to build Thameslink trains was awarded to German rival Siemens. Miliband said that while there should never be a return to the protectionism of \"propping up lame ducks or putting up trade barriers\" of the 1970s, an active industrial policy was essential. Citing the way former business secretary Lord Mandelson had in the latter years of the Labour government \"recognised the need for a change in attitude\" by bringing government, unions and management together, he claimed the decision by Nissan to build its new compact car at its factory in Sunderland, was a \"culmination of that approach\". \"The business department stopped being a sleepy backwater and became a great office of state,\" he said. \"What's the lesson I draw from this? To work, an active industrial strategy must have real vision, real drive right across government. And I don't think the government gets it. From Sheffield Forgemasters, to Bombardier, to BAE Systems, I think they've let British business down. They're still wedded to the old rules which says that government should get out of the way. A proper industrial strategy cannot become a reality if other parts of government act as a roadblock to this approach.\" Miliband later denied the fault with the Thameslink contract lay with the previous Labour administration \u2013 which set up the procurement process. Challenged on BBC Radio 5 Live after his speech, Miliband told 5 Live that the coalition government \"could have changed course on this\". \"You can find ways of redrawing the contract, you can find ways of opening it up to other firms and they could have found ways, in our view, of helping Bombardier,\" said. Asked about Labour's \u00a3150m injection into MG Rover shortly before the car firm collapsed, he said: \"I'm not saying you always make the right decisions. If you are saying the conclusion we should draw from this is that government should just stand out of the way, that it wasn't right to support the car industry during the recession, I don't agree with that.\" In his speech, Miliband made the case for pride and patriotism in British industry. \"Patriotism is about an active government using all the means at its disposal to give competitive British firms every chance to succeed,\" he said. \"Patriotism means recognising they can and do compete with the best in the world \u2013 and the belief that they deserve our backing. Patriotism means supporting fair competition, so that British firms make it onto the pitch to compete in the first place, something governments in other countries take for granted. The patriotism we need is about pride in firms headquartered here in Britain, but also in internationally-owned firms that choose to locate and invest here.\" He called for a more prominent standard Made in Britain label on all British products, which he said should receive cross party support. Backing an initiative by Merseyside-based kitchen appliance firm Stoves for a new Made in Britain mark, Miliband said they were \"three words we don't hear enough, or see enough\". He added: \"We can't recognise or celebrate our strength in manufacturing unless we know what is designed, invented and made here. It is about building the brand of British manufacturing around the world and supporting our exporters, particularly to new markets in the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China).\" The Labour leader also announced a review into the barriers to long-term corporate decision-making, which will be conducted by Sir George Cox, an engineer, former head of the Institute of Directors and currently a director of the New York Stock Exchange. \"The rules of the game, the nature of corporate governance, are at fault too. We can't encourage manufacturing investment for the long-term with rules which are geared to speculation for the short-term.\" Conservative deputy chairman Michael Fallon slammed Miliband's speech as \"just more hypocritical posturing from a weak leader\". He said: \"It was on Labour's watch that British manufacturing was abandoned and left to shrink to half its size. Labour ran our economy and our manufacturing sector into the ground. This government is working to ensure Britain makes things again.\"",

      "bodyText": "How did you come to write Jerusalem? I'd always wanted to write it, but was waiting for the right time. There are a thousand books on Jerusalem, but most of them are on the Israel-Palestine conflict. What was most difficult about it? It was the hardest and most daunting book I've ever written. I felt the Jews and Christians and Muslims of a hundred nations and three thousand years looking over my shoulder. What did you most enjoy? Spending time in Jerusalem itself and meeting Jerusalemites. How long did it take? Three years. What has changed for you since it was first published? It has been a life-changing book for me. The number of people from so many countries who write to me about it on Facebook or want me to speak in their country is much greater than with any other book. Who's your favourite writer? Guy de Maupassant, Marcel Proust, Pushkin, Isaac Bashevis Singer, John le Carr\u00e9 ... I can't decide on one. What are your other inspirations? I listen to music when I am writing \u2013 a real mixture, from Sephardic music from Jerusalem and 1940s Soviet jazz songs to Pitbull and David Guetta. I love the crassest pop and dance stuff. I went to Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg recently and thought I would hate it, but I adored it, so now that's been added to my playlist as I work. Give us a writing tip. Get it written, however imperfect. Then rewrite, rewrite, rewrite. What, if anything, would you do differently if you were starting the book again? I really wrote the book I wanted to write. Of course it is far from perfect, but the end result is exactly what I wanted it be. What are you working on now? I am writing a new novel, a sequel to my novel Sashenka. It's about the same Russian family and is set in an elite school in Stalin's Moscow in 1945. \u2022 Jerusalem is published in paperback on 1 March (\u00a39.99; Phoenix).",

      "bodyText": "The late and much missed Douglas Adams threw some spectacular parties, triggering complaints about noise from sentient beings all over the Milky Way. Now family, friends and fans of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy are marking what would have been his 60th birthday this Sunday with another bash, this time at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, which will celebrate the author's diverse talents and passionate interests via sketches, music, tributes and a rhino raffle. Assuming the venue is not demolished by evil Vogons for a hyperspace bypass in the meantime, Terry Jones, Clive Anderson, Professor Brian Cox, zoologist Mark Carwardine, Stephen Fry (by videolink from New Zealand) and Stephen Mangan (Dirk Gently in the BBC4 series) will be among those discussing Adams's unique takes on the environment, comedy, music and, in the case of co-writer John Lloyd, the Meaning of Liff. Save the Rhino will feature strongly; Adams was the charity's patron. Sketches dating back to 1974 will be fished out, and the \"Partially Plugged\" sessions of distinguished musicians who played at his parties will be recreated on stage. As Adams's 42nd birthday present, David Gilmour invited him to play guitar with Pink Floyd at Earls Court. Subsequently Adams's younger half-brother, James Thrift, heard a rumour that a film existed of this one-off moment from rock history. \"I found it a month ago,\" he rejoices. The clip will get its first public screening. Sunday's party is Thrift's brainchild. \"After Douglas died [in 2001, aged 49], my sister Jane and I set up, for Save the Rhino, the Douglas Adams memorial lecture every year on his birthday. Always at the back of my mind was the idea that we were going to get a big venue with music and comedy and gather all his friends together.\" \"It will be a bit like an end-of-term concert,\" says Dirk Maggs, one of the event's organisers. Maggs was writer and producer of the 2003-2005 Radio 4 renaissance of Hitchhiker. The original series, which began in 1978, gave birth to the novels, TV adaptation, computer game and film. Maggs is also director and scriptwriter of the Hitchhiker tour which takes to the road in June with cast members from the radio version. For six weeks this team will breath new life \u2013 or liff \u2013 into those familiar themes: the unknown question to which the answer is \"42\"; the infinite improbability drive that powers spaceships; the command \"don't panic\"; and the life-saving properties of a towel when in trouble in deep space. \"Douglas found the world a fascinating place,\" Maggs says, attempting to explain what it is that makes Adams's work such an astronomical success, 34 years after the first broadcast of Hitchhiker in 1978. \"He had a sense of discovery. We live in such a fascinating world and we are slowly killing it off. The rhino is an example, a wonderful yet so vulnerable mammal.\" Adams was not so hot on deadlines: he famously loved the \"whooshing sound\" they made as they passed him by, without his having written much on his extensive collection of computers. Years after receiving a publisher's advance for Starship Titanic, he delegated the entire book to Terry Jones, who wrote it from Adams's 16-page synopsis. \"He's not famed for his characterisation \u2013 there's no character arc,\" says Jones. \"It's about ideas. He had a totally different take. Maybe it comes from being very large? [Adams was 6ft 5in] He's the only novelist who can make ideas into page-turners and make philosophy funny. For example, he says every civilisation goes through three phases: survival ('how can we eat?'), inquiry ('why do we eat?') and sophistication ('where shall we have lunch?').\" So will Adams be at the Apollo party in spirit? \"He belonged to a strict order of atheists,\" Maggs points out, \"but it's amazing how many references there are to the afterlife or 'apr\u00e8s vie'. There is an awful lot of escaping from death.\" God features, too: the Babel fish (an in-ear instant translation device) is used both to disprove and prove the existence of the deity. But if, after the candles are blown out, the partygoers sense a tall, ghostly figure astride a rhino materialising on stage, they shouldn't panic, just check their improbability drives.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago last month one of the strangest manhunts in US history ended with police, journalists and satellite trucks surrounding a modest townhouse in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Inside was the fugitive billionaire fraudster Allen Stanford. Stanford had disappeared after the US authorities had accused him of orchestrating a \"massive ongoing fraud\". Billions were said to be missing and investors were panicking in cities from Houston to London, Caracas to Switzerland. With investors still reeling from the revelations about Bernard Madoff's historic Ponzi scheme, Stanford had become a media sensation. He had yet to be charged with criminal wrongdoing but $7bn of funds were said to be unaccounted for and the US authorities were scouring the country to ask him some questions. The 6ft 4in Texan had been run to ground after attempting to flee to Antigua, where he spent much of his time and moored his 112ft motor yacht, Sea Eagle Bikini. Sir Allen, as he was known on the island, was knighted by the island's former prime minister. He was Antigua's most powerful businessman. He owned the local newspaper, restaurants and his own cricket ground. As stories of his fall made headlines around the world a private jet company refused to accept his credit card in payment to take him back to the island. Antigua has now revoked Stanford's knighthood. But it wasn't just the Caribbean island left red-faced by its association with Stanford. The scandal proved a major embarrassment on both sides of the Atlantic. In Washington, he and his executives gave over $1.8m to Democrat and Republican politicians. President Barack Obama received $4,600 for his 2008 election campaign. He was also said to have been close to former president George W Bush. It was also a blow to the august England and Wales Cricket Board, which in 2008 signed a five-year deal with Stanford for a series of matches between England and an all-star West Indies team. Announcing the deal, Stanford arrived at Lord's cricket ground in a black helicopter and posed with a perspex case containing $20m. \"First of all this was not any kind of Ponzi scheme whatsoever. There was not any intent or plan to defraud anybody,\" Stanford told CNBC shortly before he was formally charged. He said he was \"devastated\" by what had happened and blamed the US authorities for killing off his \"solid, solvent\" businesses with their \"over-reaching\" actions. It was the last the world was to hear from Stanford for sometime. In June 2009 he was charged with fraud, conspiracy and obstruction and jailed as a flight risk. And then matters got worse. The disgraced tycoon was attacked and severely beaten in the Joe Corley Detention Facility in Conroe about 40 miles north of Houston. The assault happened in a cell holding 14 other men that had been designed to hold eight inmates. At the time of the assault the cell had no electricity, air conditioning and was in virtual darkness. Shocking photos of Stanford, his face a mass of cuts and bruises, chained at the ankles and strapped to a gurney emerged. The altercation over a telephone call left him unable to recall his own name, according to reports filed in court. He was prescribed powerful anti-anxiety medicine that doctors claimed contributed to \"extensive retrograde amnesia\" and was \"completely amnestic to his life prior to the assault\". Gone were the memories of his childhood in the tiny town of Mexia, Texas. Of how his mother, a nurse, left his father when she was nine, taking Allen and his brother with her. Gone were the stories of his failed attempt to crack the gym business, of how he made his first fortune in real estate before moving into investment management. No memories remained of his three decades of marriage to Susan and their daughter Randi, or of the women he called \"outside wives\" \u2013 mothers to at least five other children. All those happy memories of yachts, fast cars, a moated mansion in Miami, they had gone too. His lawyers claimed he was unfit to stand trial. Stanford's ever-changing legal team and the arguments over his mental health delayed the trial until late last year when judge David Hittner ruled the \"preponderance of evidence\" was that Stanford was fit to stand trial. The jury never heard from Stanford during his six-week trial. But his former Stanford Group finance chief James Davis, testifying against him, said clients were told their money went into conventional, conservative investments but the cash really went to fund his boss's lavish lifestyle. Davis has pleaded guilty to three felony charges. The picture that emerged was of one long spending spree to disaster. By the end of December 2008 Stanford International Bank had only $88m in cash \u2013 it claimed to hold $1bn in assets. As worried investors pulled out their cash, Davis told the court Stanford tried to use his beloved Antigua to bail him out.

      "body": "<p>Three years ago last month one of the strangest manhunts in US history ended with police, journalists and satellite trucks surrounding a modest townhouse in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Inside was the fugitive billionaire fraudster Allen Stanford.</p> <p>Stanford had disappeared after the US authorities had accused him of orchestrating a \"massive ongoing fraud\". Billions were said to be missing and investors were panicking in cities from Houston to London, Caracas to Switzerland.</p> <p>With investors still reeling from the revelations about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bernard-madoff\" title=\"\">Bernard Madoff's historic Ponzi scheme</a>, Stanford had become a media sensation.</p> <p>He had yet to be charged with criminal wrongdoing but $7bn of funds were said to be unaccounted for and the US authorities were scouring the country to ask him some questions.</p> <p>The 6ft 4in Texan had been run to ground after attempting to flee to Antigua, where he spent much of his time and moored his 112ft motor yacht, Sea Eagle Bikini. Sir Allen, as he was known on the island, was knighted by the island's former prime minister. He was Antigua's most powerful businessman. He owned the local newspaper, restaurants and his own cricket ground. As stories of his fall made headlines around the world a private jet company refused to accept his credit card in payment to take him back to the island.</p> <p>Antigua has now revoked Stanford's knighthood. But it wasn't just the Caribbean island left red-faced by its association with Stanford. The scandal proved a major embarrassment on both sides of the Atlantic. In Washington, he and his executives gave over $1.8m to Democrat and Republican politicians. President Barack Obama received $4,600 for his 2008 election campaign. He was also said to have been close to former president George W Bush.</p> <p>It was also a blow to the august England and Wales Cricket Board, which in 2008 signed a five-year deal with Stanford for a series of matches between England and an all-star West Indies team.</p> <p>Announcing the deal, Stanford arrived at Lord's cricket ground in a black helicopter and posed with a perspex case containing $20m.</p> <p>\"First of all this was not any kind of Ponzi scheme whatsoever. There was not any intent or plan to defraud anybody,\" Stanford told CNBC shortly before he was formally charged. He said he was \"devastated\" by what had happened and blamed the US authorities for killing off his \"solid, solvent\" businesses with their \"over-reaching\" actions.</p> <p>It was the last the world was to hear from Stanford for sometime. In June 2009 he was charged with fraud, conspiracy and obstruction and jailed as a flight risk. And then matters got worse.</p> <p>The disgraced tycoon was attacked and severely beaten in the Joe Corley Detention Facility in Conroe about 40 miles north of Houston. The assault happened in a cell holding 14 other men that had been designed to hold eight inmates. At the time of the assault the cell had no electricity, air conditioning and was in virtual darkness.</p> <p>Shocking photos of Stanford, his face a mass of cuts and bruises, chained at the ankles and strapped to a gurney emerged. The altercation over a telephone call left him unable to recall his own name, according to reports filed in court. He was prescribed powerful anti-anxiety medicine that doctors claimed contributed to \"extensive retrograde amnesia\" and was \"completely amnestic to his life prior to the assault\".</p> <p>Gone were the memories of his childhood in the tiny town of Mexia, Texas. Of how his mother, a nurse, left his father when she was nine, taking Allen and his brother with her. Gone were the stories of his failed attempt to crack the gym business, of how he made his first fortune in real estate before moving into investment management. No memories remained of his three decades of marriage to Susan and their daughter Randi, or of the women he called \"outside wives\" \u2013 mothers to at least five other children. All those happy memories of yachts, fast cars, a moated mansion in Miami, they had gone too.</p> <p>His lawyers claimed he was unfit to stand trial.</p> <p>Stanford's ever-changing legal team and the arguments over his mental health delayed the trial until late last year when judge David Hittner ruled the \"preponderance of evidence\" was that Stanford was fit to stand trial.</p> <p>The jury never heard from Stanford during his six-week trial. But his former Stanford Group finance chief James Davis, testifying against him, said clients were told their money went into conventional, conservative investments but the cash really went to fund his boss's lavish lifestyle. Davis has pleaded guilty to three felony charges.</p> <p>The picture that emerged was of one long spending spree to disaster.</p> <p>By the end of December 2008 Stanford International Bank had only $88m in cash \u2013 it claimed to hold $1bn in assets.</p> <p>As worried investors pulled out their cash, Davis told the court Stanford tried to use his beloved Antigua to bail him out. He cooked the books and 1,500 undeveloped acres Stanford had bought on the island for $64m were set to be valued at $3.2bn, Davis told the court.</p> <p>The trial has left us with a clear picture of what happened to the money but mystery remains.</p> <p>US diplomats were warning government officials not to be seen or photographed with Stanford two years before he landed at Lord's.</p> <p>\"Embassy officers do not reach out to Stanford because of the allegations of bribery and money-laundering. The ambassador managed to stay out of any one-on-one photos with Stanford during the breakfast,\" a government official wrote in a cable obtained by Wikileaks.</p> <p>While he had the money to pay, it seems few people asked him any tough questions.

      "bodyText": "The razzmatazz of the Dream Team hits Manchester on 19 July when Great Britain will take on the USA in a final warm-up match just a week before London 2012 starts. For the Team GB men's captain, Drew Sullivan, it means swapping De Montfort University's sports hall, with a capacity of 800, for the 18,000-seat Manchester Arena to lead his side against Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and their NBA superstar colleagues: the successors to Michael Jordan and company of the original Dream Team, who were all-conquering at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. In a nine-club, pan-Europe professional career Sullivan has played for the Netherlands' EiffelTowers and Pizza Express Primetel Apollon of Cyprus and he earns a modest five-figure salary as a small forward for the Jelson Homes DMU Leicester Riders. LA Lakers' Bryant is the NBA's highest earner with a $25m (\u00a316m) salary and owns five NBA championships rings. Like James, who plays for Miami Heat and earns $16m, Bryant won gold at the 2008 Beijing Games. On facing the USA, Sullivan, who has won every domestic team and individual honour plus Commonwealth bronze with England in 2006, says: \"You always want to test yourself against the best and the USA are ranked No1 in the world. To have the US team playing in Manchester will be a really big deal.\" Sullivan has led GB 26 times. What will his team talk be against the side oozing talent who hope to claim a 14th gold medal in London? \"Obviously we understand it will be a huge task, a huge challenge, but it is another game for us to get better as a team,\" he says. \"That's what I'll tell the guys: 'Enjoy the occasion, immerse yourself in the occasion, but do your best to try and win the game.'\" Sullivan, who is two inches taller than Bryant, would love the chance to mark the 6ft 6in shooting guard: \"Why not? I've had the opportunity to mark some of the best players in Europe so why not try and mark probably the best player in the world \u2013 it's the next challenge isn't it?\" There are three NBA players in the squad that Sullivan leads. The Chicago Bulls' 6ft 9in small forward Luol Deng, 26, the country's best ever player who featured in this year's NBA All-Star game; 6ft 3in shooting guard Ben Gordon, 28, of the Detroit Pistons; and Byron Mullens, who is 7ft and a centre for the Charlotte Bobcats. Deng, in particular, should be able to pass on tips to his GB team-mates, a fact Sullivan recognises. \"He's around them all the time. One of the Americans, Derrick Rose, is a team-mate so I'm sure he'll be telling us some of the things he's picked up from scouting reports, playing against these guys and giving us advice on what some of their weaknesses are as he sees them up front on a regular basis.\" Deng's presence, along with Mullens and Gordon, is significant both in Manchester and London in July: \"It will make a huge difference,\" Sullivan says. \"They've experienced playing against those guys [so] some of the knowledge that they'll bring [will be invaluable].\" Having three of the five-man team playing in the NBA allows Sullivan, 32, to be bullish when asked of his ambitions for GB at the Olympics: \"It's going to be the biggest event that I've ever been a part of. From a professional standpoint this is what you dream of: representing your country on home soil in the Olympics. \"I honestly do believe that for all the guys who put a lot of time and effort into the national team and qualifying to make the Olympics, we want to be able to leave with something. We've kind of challenged each other: let's try and medal. Let's give ourselves the best possible chance to medal. We understand that it's going to be extremely hard. But nothing worthwhile in life is easy.\" Lauren Thomas-Johnson, a member of the GB women's team who face the USA the day before in Manchester, has more modest hopes for the Olympics. \"We'd like to not have the USA or Australia in our group and get out of our group,\" she says.

Canon EOS 50D Question: The previous few mystery birds have been challenging to identify, so this one will be easy. This Ecuadorian mystery bird has no sister species, although it and its relatives have taught scientists a thing or two about evolutionary relationships. What was the result of that lesson? And what am I talking about? Can you identify this bird's taxonomic family and species? The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don't spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird's identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints so others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints may read like \"inside jokes\" and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others' enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone's enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4.

      "bodyText": "Charles Malik, the Christian architect of the universal declaration of human rights, battled against intense Soviet pressure to secure basic definitions of rights for groups and individuals as a protection against arbitrary state power after the end of the second world war. But what we have today is a human rights industry that exists as a totalising creed for a secular humanist agenda in which rights are no longer universal, but subjective. They favour some minority identities and disfavour others. If anyone has any lingering doubts about the myth of secular neutrality, they should take a look at the 2012 review of human rights, launched yesterday by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The report gauges the extent to which our society is enjoying our rights through a set of protected characteristics such as race, age, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, marriage and civil partnership, gender reassignment, and last (and also least), religion and belief. The review explicitly states that religion is to be trumped in any dispute over rights claims. Really. It says that an employer \"may legitimately refuse to accommodate an individual's religious beliefs where such accommodation would involve discrimination on the basis of other protected characteristics\". This is the much talked about \"hierarchy of human rights\" in technicolour. It follows the flawed logic of Trevor Phillips's recent comments that religious rules should end \"at the door of the temple\" and it makes it more difficult for Christians to be properly Christian in their everyday lives. The review confirms the findings of last week's Clearing the Ground inquiry report from the Christian all-party parliamentary group. It found that, although much of the recent human rights legislation was introduced in the name of equality and diversity, what it actually enforces is inequality and sameness. Unsurprisingly, the report recommends that in light of such profound religious illiteracy, the commission needs urgently to be reviewed and restructured. Whether as a reflection of the intrinsic deficiencies of the Equality Act, or as a reflection of the intrinsic deficiencies of the commission, or both, this relegation of religious freedom should concern us all. Historically, freedom of religion or conscience is not an add-on to some imagined pre-existing rights. It is foundational. Other rights such as freedom of association, speech, assembly, movement, representation, expression etc, depend on it. James Madison once observed: \"The rights of conscience \u2026 is one of the characteristics of a free people.\" And this was confirmed in recent debates in parliament that identified freedom of religion as the \"litmus test\" for emerging democracies in the Arab spring. Our own liberal democracy desperately needs to remember that pluralism makes religious liberty more necessary, just as religious liberty makes pluralism more likely. Perhaps the greatest challenge to politics today is that nobody really knows how to manage a diverse and fragmenting society. Reconciling the competing rights claims of different groups will always be a complex, messy and thankless task. The task is made harder by a law that bundles rights together and then treats them unequally. The law performs a double disservice when it eschews any pleas for reasonable accommodation, instead preferring to pit one group against another. But when we review the condition of human rights today, this is the situation we find. It is unsustainable. A society that is at ease with itself should be the goal of us all. And if the Equality and Human Rights Commission is going to help achieve this, it must begin by taking freedom of religion seriously. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

Indeed, he added, he did not know of any journalist who believed such unedited material should be disclosed. That is not, of course, the point. What we are concerned about, along with many others, is the suppression of evidence and information which would allow MI5, MI6, the police, and other agents of the state to cover up wrongdoing and unlawful acts. It was difficult to know, as he responded to questions in his characteristic rumbustious manner, how convinced Clarke really is about the merits of the government's proposals, outlined in its justice and security green paper. He certainly seems to have been heavily briefed by the spooks. It was \"ridiculous\", he said, to have officers from MI6 identifying themselves and giving evidence in open court. It would be absurd, he suggested, if an English court suddenly alerted an \"al-Qaida leader\" to discover who among his followers had been \"turned\" by MI6. It would be very dangerous, Clarke went on, to expose someone who had penetrated a hostile group on behalf of British intelligence. \"Spies are uppermost in our minds\", he told the committee. His other preoccupation was \"the need to satisfy the Americans\". Threats by the CIA to stop sharing information with UK security and intelligence agencies is what really lies behind the green paper. Washington was very angry about the decision by the appeal court, supporting earlier high court rulings, in 2010 to disclose a short summary of CIA material backing up allegations by the British resident and Guantanamo Bay detainee Binyam Mohamed that he had been abused and unlawfully treated and that British security and intelligence agencies knew about it. That, Clarke stressed, breached the control principle, whereby information supplied by the intelligence agency of one country can, on no account, be released by another country in receipt of it. The purpose behind the government's proposals is to prevent any such evidence, any wrongdoing by the security and intelligence agencies, being exposed ever again. The government has attempted to provide a sweetener by proposing that the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) should be made a little more independent. Yet the ISC, in its comments on the green paper, says the governent has not gone far enough to ensure that all intelligence material must be kept secret. Clarke must know all this though, interestingly, he said he was \"most unsettled\" by criticism of the government's plan from special advocates - the vetted lawyers who would have the unenviable task of trying to represent claimants in secret hearings from which the claimants and their own lawyers would be excluded. Clarke made it clear he will offer some concessions - narrowing the government's definition of \"sensitive\" information and the \"public interest\". But the claim that the proposals are vital in the interests of \"national security\" will remain. It is a concept that should protect a genuine need for secrecy. As Clarke inadvertently demonstrated, it also covers a multitude of sins.",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron \"almost certainly\" breached the ministerial code by failing to ask the independent adviser on ministers' interests to investigate allegations against the former defence secretary Liam Fox. The prime minister should have invited Sir Philip Mawer to examine claims that Fox's relationship with his friend Adam Werritty was in breach of parliamentary rules, according to the Whitehall watchdog Sir Christopher Kelly, chairman of the committee on standards in public life. The claim follows concerns from MPs across the House that the prime minister let the government and civil service \"off the hook\". The subsequent inquiry by then-cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell was criticised for not coming down hard enough on Fox and Ministry of Defence officials. Fox resigned last year after admitting he had misjudged his relationship with Werritty, who was best man at his wedding. Werritty was granted access to the MoD headquarters on 22 occasions over 16 months and had travelled to a number of official destinations to meet Fox and foreign government officials. Mawer, the prime minister's former adviser on ministerial interests, quit the post shortly after Fox resigned and expressed his \"frustration\" that Cameron did not call him in to handle the case. Kelly told the public administration select committee on Tuesday that Cameron had probably broken the rules and called for a change to allow the adviser on ministerial interests to launch inquiries on his own initiative, rather than having to wait for the prime minister to ask him to investigate. \"On this occasion, I think [Mawer] should have been employed. Indeed, I think it was almost certainly a breach of the ministerial code that he was not employed. \"The view of the committee [on standards in public life] is that there is advantage in this post existing and if it is going to exist, it has to be used in the way that was envisaged. \"Just like the parliamentary commissioner [on standards], the adviser should be able to initiate inquiries of their own where there is a prima facie case to investigate, whereas at the moment he is only able to do so at the request of the prime minister.\" Mawer was the first holder of the post, created by former prime minister Gordon Brown in 2008. He was given a remit to conduct inquiries into possible breaches of the ministerial code, but could do so only when requested by the prime minister, who retained the power to decide whether a minister should keep his job if a breach was committed. Mawer cleared former justice minister Shahid Malik of allegations relating to his office rental in 2009 but was not called upon to conduct any other investigations and resigned at the start of this year, to be replaced by Sir Alex Allan. Speaking to the same committee shortly after his departure, Mawer denied he had quit the post in anger at Cameron's failure to call him in but said he would have liked to have conducted a \"quick and dirty\" inquiry into the allegations against Fox. \"I believe that the adviser ought to have been brought in and ought to been brought in pretty well from the outset. That is my view,\" Mawer said in January. \"I was frustrated at the failure to call me in and I made clear to the Cabinet Office that the credibility of the role of the adviser had not been assisted. It was a missed opportunity and I regret it. \"I made my views very clear to the Cabinet Office and to the Cabinet Secretary,\" he said. A senior Conservative source said the prime minister had taken the inquiry off Mawer because he wanted a quick and hard-hitting inquiry. \"Mawer's inquiries tend to be quite slow, if thorough. It was the right decision,\" the source said.",

The company, whose gigantic sales of iPhones and computers have driven up its share price to make it the world's most valuable company by market capitalisation, more even than oil company Exxon, is also rumoured to be readying an assault on the \"smart TV\" market. That would put it into head-on competition with Google, Samsung and Sony, which have also been pushing at television \u2013 seen as one of the last bastions where the internet has not yet made a serious impression. The new iPad is expected to further accelerate the uptake of tablets across the board, whose sales are growing by more than 50% a year while those of PCs remain flat worldwide. Tablet use is growing so rapidly that in the last three months of 2011 Apple sold more iPads \u2013 15.4m \u2013 than any single vendor of PCs, including the two biggest, HP and Lenovo. Amazon's Kindle Fire and Samsung's Galaxy Tab range are also adding to the growing uptake, according to the research company IDC. The iPad is becoming so pervasive that it has begun to replace textbooks in schools and flight manuals in aircraft cockpits. The new tablet is widely expected to boast a super-high resolution \"retina display\" screen like that used on the iPhone 4, where the pixel density is so great that Apple says individual pixels cannot be distinguished. So far only Asus's latest Transformer 3 tablet, due to go on sale this summer, has achieved that measure. The focus on the display has led some, including former Apple advertising executive Andrew Miller, to forecast that it will be called the \"iPad HD, not iPad 3\". But the invitation from Apple also hints that the new device will offer something extra. \"We have something you really have to see. And touch,\" it reads. That is being seen by analysts as a hint at something beyond just a high-resolution display. \"Apple never uses words in its invitations without them meaning something,\" said Carolina Milanesi, smartphones and tablets analyst for the research company Gartner. As she pointed out, the invitation for Apple's previous event in October had a picture of some app icons, a \"1\" against the iPhone, and the phrase \"Let's talk iPhone\" \u2013 in retrospect, a pun on the planned introduction of the single iPhone 4S, with the Siri voice-driven \"assistant\" software. Milanesi thinks similar analysis will pay dividends: \"Saying you have to 'see' it obviously refers to the retina display. As for 'touch', my first thought was that they have done something to the back of the iPad.\" But the Guardian believes that the \"touch\" refers to a technology from Senseg, a Finnish startup which has developed a system called E-Sense which appears to give texture to a touchscreen. By using \"tixels\" generated by electric fields from elements embedded around the screen, it can make areas of the screen feel rough, ridged or rounded \u2013 and change those just as the screen pixels can change. When the Guardian met Senseg's chiefs in their Helsinki offices in January, its directors declined to say whether they had spoken to Apple about the use of the technology in the iPad \u2013 but said they were talking to tablet manufacturers. Apple is famously secretive about which companies it is using for its new products; in the past it has cut companies out of announcements when they have leaked information ahead of time, making those involved especially paranoid about speaking out of turn. But asked this week whether Apple is a customer for the E-Sense technology, Petri Jehkonen, Senseg's technical marketing manager, declined to comment. Asked whether Apple is not a customer, he replied: \"That would be for Apple to say. My comment is no comment.\" The update to the Apple TV has long been expected, with some retailers saying they are short of stock, which usually indicates that a new version is in the works. Expectation that Apple would move into the smart TV space, where sets can connect directly to the internet, have been high since the publication of the biography of Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder who died in October. In that he told his biographer Walter Isaacson that he had been puzzling over the problem of how to improve TV \u2013 and that now he had \"cracked it\". But so far nobody outside Apple has seen the fruits of that insight. Wednesday evening may bear fruit. \u2022 The Guardian will cover the launch at Guardian Technology",

In a deviation from the original plan, which involved a crucial piece of work at his Ditcheat stable on Saturday, Nicholls is likely to delay a final decision over Kauto Star's quest for a third Gold Cup victory until after a schooling session on Monday morning. \"It's all about taking little stepping stones forward now and it wouldn't be fair to say that any day in particular is D-day,\" said the trainer, who has been pleased with the horse's steady progress since last Thursday, when he revealed Kauto Star had been injured in a schooling fall the previous week. \"He is a thorough professional and I think that's helping him,\" Nicholls added, explaining that Kauto Star had come through his most testing workout since the fall in good condition. \"We gave him two strong canters up the hill alongside my Fred Winter hopeful, Ulck Du Lin, and I have to report that he came through it fine and I'm happy with him. \"What particularly pleased me was that, aside from looking great, he came back from the work and had a good roll in his box, always a good sign with him. \"We'll take him to Wincanton, where he will work with Mon Parrain and everybody can make their own minds up about how he works and how he looks. \"He had a racecourse gallop before he won the Betfair Chase and I thought it a better idea to give him a spin, and a good workout, on the grass away from home. \"I must stress that it is one step at a time and it is important that people don't get carried away. We aren't, just yet, but we are heading in the right direction. Quickly, it seems.\" On Tuesday it was the participation of the Gold Cup favourite, Long Run, which was seemingly thrown into question after peculiar betting market moves were followed by television reports hinting at problems afflicting Nicky Henderson's charge. The trainer, who had already described himself as a bundle of nerves with the start of the Festival inching nearer, claimed to be bemused by it all, and Long Run's owner, Robert Waley-Cohen, offered a measured response. \"I've been lucky enough to be friends with Nicky since the 1970s and if there was the slightest problem I know him well enough to expect the phone call,\" he said. \"It's a call all owners dread at this time of the year and I'm not sure it gets any easier just because I've been lucky enough to have been in this position before, but you just have to accept that things can go wrong. \"I can't tell you what was going on with the betting. Maybe it's just someone trying to do a bit of market manipulation. But I've spoken to Nicky and he was watching the horse work when we talked. Everything's fine. \"They say that 24 hours is a long time in politics and it's even longer in racing. The slightest thing can derail weeks and months of careful planning. But so far, so good for Long Run and I'm pleased that the news sounds promising for Kauto Star too.\" Waley-Cohen's words came as the participation of another Festival favourite, the Triumph Hurdle hope Grumeti, was thrown into question after his trainer, Alan King, revealed a minor setback. \"On Monday night Grumeti spread his right fore shoe and the toeclip has gone into the foot, which left him lame and quite sore this morning,\" King said. \"We certainly would not have wanted this to happen next Tuesday but the Triumph is still 10 days away and I would hope that he would be sound again in 48 hours and able to exercise again at the weekend.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest property manager Peverel Group has been rescued from administration by two private equity companies in a \u00a362m deal that saves 4,200 jobs and severs Peverel's ties with the Vincent Tchenguiz property empire. It ends 12 months of uncertainty for thousands of tenants in retirement homes and residential blocks managed by Peverel. Chamonix Private Equity and Electra Partners have bought Peverel, whose holding companies collapsed into administration a year ago after property tycoon Tchenguiz ran up debts of \u00a3125m. All 4,200 employees will stay on, after Peverel traded profitably during its year in administration with Zolfo Cooper. Peverel manages 59,000 retirement flats in 1,300 developments, including many McCarthy &amp; Stone retirement homes, as well as 132,000 leasehold apartments in residential blocks. Tenants have accused the company of charging excessive fees and giving a poor service. Chamonix and Electra have appointed Janet Entwistle, previously the managing director of BT Fleet, as chief executive of Peverel and Paul Lester, the former chief executive of VT Group, as chairman. Entwistle said her background working in service businesses would help. \"I've swapped vehicles for properties,\" she said. She admitted that there were serious issues that she would need to address. Last year a Guardian Money investigation highlighted a catalogue of accusations \u2013 denied by Peverel \u2013 regarding rising service charges, maintenance failures, broken promises, excessive insurance costs and high exit fees from retirement homes. \"There are clearly a lot of concerns that people have and we will talk to them; we want to have a reputation for having excellent customer service,\" said Entwistle. \"There clearly are some industry-wide issues that are of concern, and potentially some structural issues in the sector.\" Crucially, she said, Peverel's debt has been slashed from \u00a3125m to just \u00a325m. The debt was owed to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which gets about \u00a360m net sale proceeds. The new debt financing of \u00a325m is being provided by Royal Bank of Scotland. Peverel had an \"inappropriate capital structure \u2013 that debt burden led to it being in administration,\" said Entwistle. Tchenguiz bought Peverel in 2007 with financial backing from Merrill Lynch, now part of Bank of America. Peverel's collapse came just days after he was arrested as part of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the failure of Iceland's Kaupthing bank. The tycoon denied wrongdoing and the SFO apologised to Tchenguiz over the way it handled the investigation, admitting to \"very regrettable errors\". He has started a multimillion-pound damages claim against the SFO. A three-day judicicial review hearing is due to start on 22 May. The tycoon blamed Peverel's collapse on Bank of America Merrill Lynch's \"sudden\" decision after his arrest to demand repayment of the \u00a3125m loan plus \u00a311m interest. Chamonix, an investment firm founded in 2006, had been working on the rescue deal for a year and brought in Electra, which is investing \u00a333m of equity in Peverel. Andrew Hartley, one of Chamonix's three partners, said the two firms would invest in improving IT and services, and expanding Peverel's telecare and telehealth arms. Careline, Peverel's telecare subsidiary, provides social alarm call monitoring through alarm systems wired up to people's homes or by wearing a pendant which activates if they suffer a fall. Its new telehealth division Appello offers monitoring of people living at home with critical illnesses such as diabetes, heart conditions and high blood pressure.",

      "bodyText": "Libya has all but closed the door on allowing British police to travel to the country to investigate the Lockerbie bombing and the killing of the police officer Yvonne Fletcher. The interior minister, Fawzi Abdel A'al, said there was no treaty allowing UK police to visit Libya, and any agreement at some future date might depend on whether Britain answered questions about its past involvement with Muammar Gaddafi's regime. \"There is no treaty between Britain and Libya to allow such a thing,\" he said in an interview with the Guardian and Agence France Press. \"The Libyan people have questions for Britain when talking about this case,\" he said of Fletcher's death. \"Why did they shut up about this all these years and bring it up now?\" Discussing Lockerbie and the release of the convicted bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi on compassionate grounds, he said: \"Didn't America and Britain accept millions of dollars from Gaddafi as the price to end this case? Who let Abdelbaset al-Megrahi go? Did we? \"Do you remember when Fletcher was killed? We are now in 2012. Where was the British government from 1984 until 2011?\" He said Britain needed to explain the reasons for the rapprochement between Britain and the Gaddafi regime in 2004, sealed when the former prime minister Tony Blair visited Libya. \"Why did the British government improve its relations with Gaddafi? Something happened in this case between the former Libyan regime and the British government to end this dispute. Didn't the former British prime minister Tony Blair visit Libya more than one time? Saif al-Islam [Gaddafi's son] came out one time in a statement to say that Blair was an adviser to his father. Blair was an adviser to Gaddafi after he left the government.\" Abdel A'al, a former Misratan district attorney who is seen by diplomats as a high flier in Libya's cabinet, was appointed to the job in November and has access to tens of thousands of files detailing the Gaddafi regime's dealings with foreign powers. He said he might consent to an investigation by Libyan authorities without the involvement of UK police. \"We see that the best way to solve this now is that the British government ask the Libyan authorities to open an investigation inside Libya, and for the Libyan side to hand in all the information they have on this case so the Libyan authorities can start investigations.\" His statement is likely to be viewed as a setback to both the Metropolitan police, investigating the 1984 killing of Fletcher by shots fired from the London Libyan embassy, and Scottish police wanting to pursue the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie in 1988. In December the minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, met Abdel A'al in Tripoli and announced that Libya had agreed to allow UK investigators to visit Libya. Instead, Libya's authorities seem to have decided against it, although the governing National Transitional Council is due to hand over to an elected government in elections expected in June. Abdel A'al said he had no animosity towards the British people. \"Britain is loyal to the Libyan state and I don't think the British politicians or the British people are trying to embarrass the Libyans by bringing up these cases at this time,\" he said. The interior minister also said he had armed units ready to attack a militia base in Tripoli to liberate two British journalists being held there, but wanted to give negotiations a chance. The reporter Nick Davies and cameraman Gareth Montgomery-Johnson have been held by a Misratan militia at a base on Tripoli's seafront since 23 February, accused of possible espionage. \"We have the capacity to raid this base, we are capable of applying a military solution, but this would cost a lot of blood so we continue to negotiate,\" said Abdel A'al. He said the Misratan militia unit had no authority for its capture and detention of the journalists. \"The behaviour is completely illegal. Why do they detain journalists or anyone? We do not recognise any measures taken by this militia,\" he said.",

It also sponsors Libor, or the London InterBank Offered Rate. Every working day a panel of banks is asked this question: \"At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 11am?\" A lot hinges on the banks' answers. The submissions are totted up, trimmed of outliers, and then processed by Thomson Reuters to produce the arithmetic mean called Libor. The BBA describes Libor as \"a benchmark giving an indication of the average rate at which a leading bank can obtain unsecured funding in the London interbank market for a given period, in a given currency\". And since there are 10 currencies and 15 different maturities, there are in fact 150 different Libor benchmarks. They matter because piles and piles of debt and derivative instruments are priced off Libor \u2013 worth some $350tn (\u00a3225tn), it is thought \u2013 including corporate loans, household mortgages and credit cards. It would be a poor show, therefore, if the Libor could be manipulated to give an artificial reading \u2013 or even if an attempt at manipulation could be made. That, though, is the suspicion. Several banks and brokers have suspended employees and a massive global inquiry by regulators has been under way for months. The whiff of a financial mega-scandal is in the air. The first culprit \u2013 once again \u2013 looks likely to be the regulatory system. To outside eyes, it seems bizarre that oversight of something as important as setting the benchmark for $350tn of financial products could be left to the bankers' trade body. Shouldn't the regulators be in direct charge, since this is territory where a difference of even a fraction of a percentage point matters? As currently conducted, the process seems worryingly lacking in transparency. One can understand why best estimates of borrowing rates, rather than achieved rates, are used, since not every bank will borrow on a given day. But that introduces a large slice of subjectivity into the system. How are ambiguities policed? \"Thomson Reuters runs a collection of automated and manual tests on the submitted rates before they are sent to the calculation engine,\" explains the BBA's website. That doesn't tell us much. It's time for some fresh air to blow through the Libor-setting system.",

Thirty workers living in a two-bedroom house that was structurally dangerous, threatened by men wielding baseball bats if they complained. A worker who lost a leg when the illegal minivan transporting him was involved in an accident. A bonded worker doing 12 hours hard labour six days a week from 3.30am milking cows and breaking rocks on a dairy farm. These are a tiny number of the cases of extreme exploitation found by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) during its recent inspections. Last year it uncovered 845 cases of workers being exploited in the food processing and farming business in the UK. More than 90% of its operations, which are driven by intelligence it receives, identified serious cases of abuse. Yet the government has deemed all this activity \"a burden on business\", so much tedious red tape around a beleaguered industry that should be swept aside in favour of a more \"voluntary\" and \"light-touch\" approach to enforcement. On coming into office it set up a farming regulation taskforce as part of its \"red tape challenge\", a Tory pledge to revisit all regulation to see whether it is really necessary and to free business where possible of its shackles. The taskforce made 220 recommendations of ways to ease the burden on farmers, and the government has just published its response to those. Its answer to the vast majority of the recommendations is an enthusiastic yes, with no pause even to consult further as would be usual. The recommendations include the idea of inspecting \"good\" farmers less often, and looking at alternatives to the mandatory licencing of gangmasters including voluntary registration. The taskforce was drawn almost entirely from the farming industry or people with vested interests in it and chaired by Richard Macdonald, the recently retired director general of the National Farmers Union. There was no one on it representing workers, or the wider environment. No one to remind them as they considered their bonfire of rules designed to protect the rural environment and the safety of those working in it that this sector has the worst workplace death and injury rates of any, including those often considered more dangerous: mining and construction. But inviting industry in to rewrite the policy rules is a pattern with this government: the secretary of state for health, Andrew Lansley, has the food and alcohol industry coming up with voluntary measures to tackle the public health crises of obesity and binge drinking; the Treasury has the tax directors of major corporations on its working groups drawing up new rules on easing the burden of taxation on multinationals. The farming industry has been greatly displeased by the GLA's activities in exposing abuses in the dairy industry. It is currently prosecuting 19 dairy farmers who include some of the largest and most high-profile in the country for using an unlicensed gangmaster to supply them with skilled migrant dairy men (18 of the defendants have pleaded not guilty, the other has entered no plea). Many in the industry have accused the GLA of being overzealous and argued a warning would have done, as though the law need not apply to them. It is an open secret that some have lobbied ministers against the authority, which has already endured the punishment of a 25% cut in funding over the lifetime of this parliament. But before the government rushes to undermine the GLA and its powers any further, it would do well to remember that much of the anger against immigration that has boiled up in its rural and blue-collar working heartlands has been fuelled by dismay at the crime that has been so clearly and visibly associated with gangmaster employment of migrants. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "Allen Stanford, the Texan financier, knight of Antigua, Washington power player and billionaire benefactor of English cricket, has been found guilty of orchestrating a $7bn Ponzi scheme. After a six-week trial in Houston, Texas, a jury found him guilty of conspiracy and 12 other criminal charges including obstruction. He was acquitted of one wire fraud charge. Stanford, who turns 62 on 24 March, faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced. The jury of eight men and four women had appeared to be deadlocked on Monday and had to be given instructions by the judge, David Hittner. Outside, family members had gathered to offer their support. \"I'm hoping for the best,\" Stanford's 84-year-old father, James, told the Houston Chronicle as he waited for the verdict. \"We support him 100%. In fact, 150%.\" During the trial prosecutors argued that Stanford used his clients' money to fuel his \"lavish lifestyle and his loser companies\" in a massive Ponzi scheme that spanned two decades. Stanford, they argued, conned investors into buying certificates of deposit, or CDs, from his bank on the Caribbean island nation of Antigua, telling them they were a safe investment. Instead the bank was \"his own personal ATM\", the prosecutor William Stellmach said. By 2008 Stanford's bank owed depositors more than $7bn that it did not have and Stanford had blown huge chunks of that cash on luxury yachts, private jets and cricket sponsorship. In damning testimony James Davis, Stanford Financial Group's former chief financial officer, told jurors his boss was \"the chief faker\" \u2013 a man who threatened to fire anyone who questioned the $2bn prosecutors say he pocketed from his Antiguan bank. The picture that emerged during Davis's testimony was one of a long spending spree to disaster. By the end of December 2008 Stanford International Bank had only $88m in cash, but claimed to hold $1bn in assets. As worried investors pulled out their cash, Davis told the court Stanford tried to use his beloved Antigua to bail him out. He cooked the books and 1,500 undeveloped acres Stanford had bought on the island for $64m were set to be valued at $3.2bn, Davis told the court. Stanford's attorneys argued that the bank would be solvent today if the US government had not shut it down in February 2009. They did not put the businessman on the witness stand, although Stanford had reportedly wanted to testify.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest commercial news provider, ITN, has vowed to face down \"increased pressure\" from the police to hand over unbroadcast footage of public unrest. The head of compliance for ITN, John Battle, criticised a \"worrying trend\" of wide-ranging production orders from the police. He compared the situation to Russia and said journalists were in danger of being seen as an evidence-gathering arm of the police. Broadcasters including the BBC, ITN and Sky News have been ordered in recent months to hand over footage of the England riots, the evacuation of Dale Farm and protests outside the Syrian embassy in London. ITN, the producer of ITV News, Channel 4 News and 5 News, is seeking a judicial review of the Chelmsford magistrates' court order to disclose 36 hours of footage from the Dale Farm eviction to Surrey police. \"It has clearly become a real issue,\" Battle said. \"In the past these things were rare \u2013 they weren't a deluge. The message needs to be sent to police and the courts that broadcasters have a role to play and that is being jeopardised by increased pressure and being seen as evidence gatherers. It's a steelier stance than we've seen before.\" Battle said the UK would condemn as \"outrageous and chilling\" attempts by Russian law enforcement to demand media footage of this weekend's election protests in that country. \"The fact is that's what is happening here,\" he said. Asked why there had been an increase in productions orders from police, a spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: \"Indications are that the increase in the number of production orders sought by police are a direct result of the summer disturbances and other such high-profile incidents that have attracted recent media attention. \"Broadcast and correspondence evidence retrieved in these cases has been fundamentally vital in securing convictions and furthering investigations.\" Earlier on Tuesday, British Transport police chief constable, Andy Trotter, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that broadcasters should not be seen as an arm of the law. Trotter, media advisor to ACPO, said the police have an \"overriding duty\" to obtain all evidence available. He added: \"And the test we have to take to the judge, and this is a judge who decides, is a stringent test, there's got to be a serious crime.

He writes economically and you never know where the story's going next. A friend put me onto him and I read Little Hands Clapping, which is delightfully bizarre.

      "bodyText": "Keir Hardie Hall Working Men's Club in Norwich looks like \u2026 well, a working men's club in Norwich. But on this particular Sunday, the clientele look unusual. Hoodies and neck tattoos are the order of the day. The Don't Flop rap battle league has come to town, and the venue is stuffed with rowdy youngsters, apart from one slightly incongruous older man in a blue corduroy blazer. Some big names in the rap battle scene are here \u2013 gregarious Croydon MC Micky Worthless, the outrageously camp Pamflit, and local hero Sensa, one of the UK's finest battlers. But most of the pre-battle buzz centres on that man in the blazer. Mark Grist of Peterborough: poet, battle rhymer, former English teacher and genuine internet sensation. A few weeks ago, 30-year-old Grist's recent battle with teenage Mancunian MC Blizzard was uploaded by Don't Flop, and it went viral. At the time of writing, it has garnered 1.75m views all over the world and turned Grist into a star and unlikely heart-throb. He's not actually Blizzard's teacher (he lives in Peterborough, Blizzard in Manchester), but it seems people liked the fiction more than the fact. One thing's for certain \u2013 when he steps up in battle against the diminutive London MC Pedro, there's palpable anticipation in the room, which is immediately justified when his first line (\"Pedro/You're shorter than any hedgerow\") brings the house down. \"I rate him highly,\" says Rowan \"Eurgh\" Faife, the organiser of Don't Flop. \"People relate to him because he's just himself, battling in a suit because that's how he's comfortable. Realistically, I thought their battle would get 100,000 views but it got picked up by people who wouldn't normally watch Don't Flop. It's a bit more interesting than just two guys shouting.\" Grist grew up in Unst, in Shetland, and the northernmost island in Great Britain, where the sporadic presence of electricity led him to read \"a lot\". He ended up at Norwich's University of East Anglia studying American and English literature, then went into fast-track teaching: \"I always wanted to be a teacher or a rock star.\" His unorthodox techniques involved \"battling\" his pupils in the character of figures from books such as Lennie and Curley in John Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men. And he did very well \u2013 his next step would have been an assistant headmaster role, but Grist had other ideas. \"I wanted to expand my poetry a bit more. It felt like the teaching route was to get rid of my creativity, and the other was exciting, terrifying. It took a while for my mum to acknowledge that I wasn't unemployed.\" His spoken-word duo with MC Mixy, Dead Poets, now perform at literary and musical festivals and appear at schools. Blizzard was only his second solo Don't Flop battle, and Grist still seems a touch dazed by the reaction. \"I got told that it was the second or third highest clip on Reddit, and I'd never even heard of Reddit. I looked back on YouTube and there were comments on there with 40 or 50 thumbs up.\" As much as the subsequent hysteria is flattering, it's clear that much of the ire directed at his opponent, for the crime of being young and working-class, bothers Grist. \"Blizzard's wordplay is a lot more complex than other rappers \u2013 including mine. What frustrates me is that we have taken a lot of artistic opportunities away from our teenagers. Sticking up a skateboard park isn't going to solve the problem of their having nothing to do. It's a bit like the last kick in the teeth, when we take away so many artistic opportunities; they develop their own form of artistic impression, and we seem to look very negatively on it. Blizzard is much more eloquent than I am in that battle. He wasn't 'destroyed'.\" Since that battle, in which Blizzard's mother came in for rather caustic stick, Grist has vowed to eliminate from his verses the aspects of battle rap that many find distasteful. But he is quick to point out that he does not stand in judgment over those who won't. \"Rap battles police themselves \u2013 if something is not all right, the room will make it clear. Mum jokes, homophobic insults, they're just targets to hit. But there are lots of other targets. All I'm doing is questioning whether you need to hit certain ones or whether you can only hit the ones that you're comfortable hitting. It's not a moral stance, because I don't believe those guys believe a single word they're saying. They're just following a routine.\" His battle over, Grist doesn't get to enjoy the post-event pub crawl around a deserted Norwich city centre \u2013 being an internet sensation, it seems, is a full-time job. \"I am spending all of my time responding to emails. I have people who want to talk about larger projects, which may involve moving into TV. The other day, my barber chased me down because his apprentice can't believe he cuts my hair. Very embarrassing.\"",

In fact, they do come from Manchester, and as per other bands from that city, they have retained their anonymity to the extent that we don't know their names or indeed if they are a he, she or they. Wait, come back! They \u2013 or he, or she \u2013 can hardly be accused of being fashionably mysterious when acts from their (or his, or hers \u2013 we'll stop doing that now and use the generic plural) hometown have a history of assuming such a stance going back to the early 80s, when mystique and obfuscation were the air the music press breathed. So what do we know about No Ceremony///? We know they were one of Amazing Radio's tips for 2012, their name is followed by three forward slashes (the devil is in the pop detail), they've been played on Radio 1, and they're making their live debut in Manchester on 18 May at Spinningfields for an event called New Sounds of the North alongside alt-J, Money, and more. By which point their cover will presumably be blown, unless they perform wearing masks. Everything else about them is opinion \u2013 some say their artwork hints at Metallica if they'd signed to Factory \u2013 rumour and hearsay. It has even been speculated that Wu Lyf's \"War God\" Warren Bramley may actually be No Ceremony///. We don't have a problem with that, with pop groups or rock bands as the front for Men with Ideas. No Ceremony/// are more of a pop group than a rock band, going by the four tracks we've heard, and that includes new single Heartbreaker, which is available for free download and apparently features Joey Santiago of Pixies on guitar. It's heavier, fuzzier, guitarier than their other songs, but it's still melodic and commercial in a New Order/Pet Shop Boys way. It is, of course, predominantly electronic, epic and anthemic with a synth-bass throb and piano pulse that suggests Coldplay remixed by Coldcut. Like everything with the NC/// imprimatur it is dominated by Auto-Tuned vocals, which pleases us no end: that they should, in this, the age of the tyranny of the voice, make as their leitmotif, their trademark, the non-voice, the machine cry, the studio whimper, that they should prioritise the inhuman when elsewhere we are being overwhelmed with \"passion\". On Hurt Love, their previous single, piano and Auto-Tuned vocals \u2013 ones not easily identifiable as male or female \u2013 are employed once more, this time to set an emotional scene, with \"I love the way you caught me deep inside\" as good an opening line as we've heard of late. Deliverus is more acoustic, only with industrial FX, and WeAreMe is ghostly and rhythmic, with handclaps and a 4/4 beat although it's not dance or house. Call us fanciful, but it would delight us no end to discover \u2013 and it would make perfect sense if it were true \u2013 that this was Natalie Curtis, coaxed from behind the camera lens to make her musical debut \u2026 The buzz: \"A dissonance that carries an implication of doom but manages to do so harmoniously\" \u2013 tumblr.com. The truth: If New Order were an out and out pop group operating today, with Paul Epworth as producer. Most likely to: Tear you apart. Least likely to: Cause resentments to ride high. What to buy: The single Heartbreaker is released by NOC on 30 April. File next to: Hurts, New Order, Chemical Brothers, James Blake. Links: tumblr.com. Wednesday's new band: Electric Guest.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of Republicans were flocking to the polls on Super Tuesday, the biggest day of the presidential nomination race, with Mitt Romney hoping he will end the day having finally managed to break away from the pack. Romney's campaign team, while anxious not to be seen as over-confident, are anticipating winning about half of the 10 states in play, including make-or-break Ohio. Having been behind in the polls in Ohio, Romney has seen a surge in support over the last few days that has left him neck-and-neck with Rick Santorum, a pattern similar to last week's Michigan primary, which he eventually won after overcoming Santorum's double-digit poll lead. Romney, who is to spend election night at his headquarters in Boston, is anxious to bring the race to an end to concentrate money and effort on the campaign against President Barack Obama in November. Speaking in Ohio on the eve of polling, Romney expressed the hope he would win support in Ohio and other Super Tuesday states. \"I believe if I do, I'll get the nomination. And then we can start organising our effort to make sure that we replace President Obama.\" But Santorum's team is hoping that the demographics in Ohio, with its large working-class population and its closeness to his home state of Pennsylvania, will tip the balance in his favour. He is holding his election night rally in Steubenville, Ohio, close to the Pennsylvania border. \"I'm feeling good \u2013 not just about Ohio, but about all of Super Tuesday,\" Santorum said. He had been outspent 12-1 in advertising in Ohio, he claimed. \"To be this close is a remarkable thing.\" If he pulls off a surprise win in Ohio, it will wreck Romney's hopes of an early end to a race that has been marked by intense infighting and may be damaging the party's chances in the White House race. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich is well ahead in the polls in his home state, Georgia, and signalled today he is not planning to quit the race anytime soon. \"Tuesday is going to be a mixed bag, and I think the race will go on,\" Gingrich told CNN. \"There won't be any decisive winner Tuesday.\" Gingrich, as evidence he intends to keep going, bought up advertising space for next week's contests in Mississippi and Alabama. After months of crazy swings back and forth in the Republican race, even if Gingrich wins Georgia and Santorum Tennessee and Oklahoma, there could still be clarity at the end of the night, with Romney establishing a clear lead in the tally of delegates. There are 419 delegates at stake on Super Tuesday, and Romney expects to take at least half of them to add to the 203 he has accumulated so far. Santorum has 92, Gingrich 33 and Ron Paul, who has been campaigning in the smaller states \u2013 Idaho, North Dakota and Alaska \u2013 25. A candidate needs 1,144 delegates, half of those attending the Republican convention in Florida in August, to seal the nomination. Santorum and Gingrich have been unable to match Romney in terms of money and organisation, running ramshackle outfits. As a result of poor organisation, neither Santorum nor Gingrich is on the ballot in Virginia, leaving just Romney and Paul to fight it out, and Santorum has already lost 18 of Ohio's 66 delegates through incompetent organisation. Even as polling was under way in the Super Tuesday states, Romney's supporters, who have already been airing ads in Mississippi and Alabama before next week's contests, announced they are looking beyond next week and have bought ads for the contests after that, in Illinois and Louisiana.",

      "bodyText": "A French government report is calling for a ban on \"mini-miss\" beauty pageants and children's lingerie to combat what it describes as the \"hyper-sexualisation\" of children. The moves follow an international controversy over a Vogue magazine photographic shoot featuring provocative images of a 10-year-old French girl. The parliamentary report, Against Hyper-Sexualisation: A New Fight For Equality, calls for a ban on child-size adult clothing, such as padded bras and high-heeled shoes for children, and an end to beauty competitions for the under-16s. Chantal Jouanno, the author of the report and a senator and former sports minister, has also called for the outlawing of young models in advertising campaigns and the return of uniforms in primary schools as part of a series of measures to stem the psychological damage she believes is being done to children. Jouanno said young girls were being disguised as \"sexual candy\" in a competition over appearance, beauty and seduction, which she said was \"contrary to the dignity of the human being\" and a step backwards in the battle for sex equality. \"This phenomenon is a real concern for society,\" Jouanno told Le Figaro newspaper. \"Today, children are building their identities amid a regression of sexual equality and on the return of stereotypes contained in music clips, games, reality television programmes. The danger is not only individual but collective. \"We have a great responsibility as both politicians and parents.\" She argued that while the sexualisation of children is not widespread in France, it is increasing and becoming acceptable because of what she described as the insidious \"normalisation\" of pornographic images. The issue has also been taken up in Britain, Belgium and Quebec. A British report last year, Letting Children be Children, recommended excluding sexual imagery from children's daily lives by tighter controls on advertising and pre-watershed television schedules. The French report was prompted by international outrage after publication of a multi-page feature in Vogue's December 2010 issue in which 10-year-old Thylane Loubry Blondeau, and two other girls, were photographed pouting and posing heavily made up, with lipstick, tight dresses, jewels and high heels. While the feature initially failed to rouse anger in France, it caused outrage in America where the pictures were considered inappropriate, prompting the French government to announce its inquiry. Vogue defended the article, saying the young models were simply dressing up \"like maman\", as all young girls do. Blondeau, whose mother is French actress turned designer Veronica Loubry and father former footballer Patrick Blondeau, has been modelling since she was five. Her mother, Loubry, defended the photographs in a blog at the time, writing: \"The only thing that shocks me about the photo is that the necklace she is wearing is worth three million euros \u2026 my daughter isn't naked, let's not blow things out of proportion.\" The view was not shared by most French mothers; a survey carried out at the time of the controversy by the parenting website Magicmaman found 84% of those asked thought the images of Blondeau were demeaning. The government report, published on Monday, criticised the marketing of padded bras for eight year olds, thong underwear, make-up kits, and leggy dolls, all aimed at pre-pubescent girls under the age of 12. Specialists involved in the research concluded that this precocious sexualisation affected mostly girls and caused \"psychological damage that is irreversible in 80% of cases\". At worse, said the report, it could result in eating disorders including anorexia. As well as banning clothing and make up considered inappropriate for young girls, Jouanno also proposes making it illegal for top fashion houses or companies to use models under 16 in their campaigns. Reintroducing school uniforms was a way of combatting competition between pupils over fashion label clothes which highlight social inequalities, said the report.",

      "bodyText": "The Muppets could once again be lighting the lights and playing the music on television following the global success of their big-screen return. A senior Disney executive said the company was considering all options for the show, which originally ran between 1976 and 1981. Disney has announced a sequel for the film, which won the best song Oscar and by the end of last week had taken $158m (\u00a3132m) worldwide. \"I am looking at that as we speak, it's a really fun one to work on,\" said marketing chief and channels manager for Disney in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Tricia Wilber. Disney also on Tuesday announced plans for a new original animated series, Randy Cunningham: Ninth Grade Ninja, which is being co-produced by Boulder Media in Ireland and Titmouse Inc in Los Angeles. It will air on the Disney XD channel. It will feature the voice of Tim Curry as the \"evil sorcerer\", Ben Schwartz as Randy Cunningham and John Oliver of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart fame. Disney is also rebooting Winnie the Pooh for a younger audience with Tales of Friendship with Winnie the Pooh, a preschool storytelling-based series. Wilber said there was a \"strong affinity and passion and connection\" to the Muppets in the UK. \"The investment in the film was obviously significant ... we did want to see where and how it performed. We are looking at what this means for us and how we could take that further. Obviously the success here [in the UK] is a key driver in that,\" she told a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch on Tuesday. \"What we'd do is ask what's the right opportunity for the franchise,\" she added. \"If you went down the television series route it could play on the Disney Channel but it could also play in primetime on a free-to-air network. We would look at a variety of different models.\" Wilber said it also might return in other formats such as an app, which she said could be turned around much faster than a new TV show. Disney's senior vice president, original programming in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Marc Buhaj, said there was \"no shortage of excitement with various creative folk in the world how we could work with the Muppets\". The Jim Henson Company, the original creators of the Muppets, are currently developing a Saturday teatime chatshow format with a puppet host for BBC1.

It will air on the Disney XD channel.</p> <p>It will feature the voice of Tim Curry as the \"evil sorcerer\", Ben Schwartz as Randy Cunningham and John Oliver of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart fame.</p> <p>Disney is also rebooting Winnie the Pooh for a younger audience with Tales of Friendship with Winnie the Pooh, a preschool storytelling-based series.</p> <p>Wilber said there was a \"strong affinity and passion and connection\" to the Muppets in the UK.</p> <p>\"The investment in the film was obviously significant ... we did want to see where and how it performed. We are looking at what this means for us and how we could take that further. Obviously the success here [in the UK] is a key driver in that,\" she told a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"What we'd do is ask what's the right opportunity for the franchise,\" she added.</p> <p>\"If you went down the television series route it could play on the Disney Channel but it could also play in primetime on a free-to-air network. We would look at a variety of different models.\"</p> <p>Wilber said it also might return in other formats such as an app, which she said could be turned around much faster than a new TV show.</p> <p>Disney's senior vice president, original programming in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Marc Buhaj, said there was \"no shortage of excitement with various creative folk in the world how we could work with the Muppets\".</p> <p>The Jim Henson Company, the original creators of the Muppets, are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/01/muppets-team-develop-bbc1-show\" title=\"\">currently developing a Saturday teatime chatshow format with a puppet host for BBC1</a>.</p> <p>The original Muppets series ran in the UK on ITV.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "Robert B Sherman was the son of Jewish immigrants to the US, and while still in his teens he was part of the first American military unit to enter the Dachau concentration camp shortly after its evacuation in 1945. After the war, he joined with his younger brother Richard to form a songwriting partnership. It took until 1958 before they had their first top 10 hit, Tall Paul, with Mouseketeer Annette Funicello. As a result, the duo subsequently came to the notice of Walt Disney, and they became staff songwriters for the Disney studio. They composed a song for Disney's It's a Small World attraction at the 1964 New York World's Fair and, as the song remained uncopyrighted at the request of Unicef, is most likely the most widely known of all their work. The brothers were also put to work on Disney's musicals. In 1961 The Parent Trap featured Hayley Mills in a dual role as twins, and she wowed audiences by performing the Sherman song Let's Get Together as a duet. Four years later, Mary Poppins became Disney's biggest film, with the Shermans making their mark in songwriting myth by winning the 1965 Oscar for best song for Chim Chim Cher-ee, featuring Dick Van Dyke's appalling Cockney accent. The score remains fantastically popular to this day, with any number of hummable classics. You might prefer this: Or this: Or even this: The Shermans did not rest on their laurels. In 1967 they did arguably their greatest work, on The Jungle Book. Can anything top I Want to Be Like You, sung into immortality by Louis Prima? Then again: Disney himself died during the making of The Jungle Book, the end of an era in movie history. It precipitated a change for the Shermans too: they accepted their first non-Disney film, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Fortunately Chitty Chitty Bang Bang turned out a firm family favourite \u2013 as did Bedknobs and Broomsticks, their 1971 film back in the Disney stable. Using the same mix of live action and animation as Mary Poppins, it got them more Oscar nominations \u2013 but unfortunately not for The Beautiful Briny, their most memorable effort on the score. They lost at the Oscars, anyway, to the Theme from Shaft \u2013 perhaps a telling comment on the way things were going. Although The Slipper and the Rose brought an Oscar nomination in 1976, repackagings of Winnie the Pooh cartoons, for which they had penned songs in the 1960s, was the highlight of the late 70s and 80s.",

      "bodyText": "Russians furious about Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency fear a wider crackdown after hundreds were arrested following a post-election protest. \"It is absolutely certain that the period of peaceful protests and marches is over,\" the novelist Boris Akunin, a member of the protest organising committee, told Kommersant FM radio. He criticised riot police, deployed by the thousand to the capital during and after the vote, for violently detaining hundreds of protesters on Monday. Future protests would lead to \"a clear manifestation of aggression from the authorities\", he said, a testament to their \"nervousness\". Putin's spokesman defended the arrests, saying the helmet-clad riot police had acted with a \"high level of professionalism, legitimacy and effectiveness\". The Russian foreign ministry took it further, writing directly to the US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, to criticise the New York police department's handling of Occupy Wall Street protesters. \"The police on Pushkin Square were many times more humane than what we saw during the breakup of Occupy Wall Street, tent camps in Europe,\" the ministry wrote. Opposition activists said they feared authorities would use means both legal and extralegal to squash the anti-Putin movement that exploded after a disputed parliamentary vote in December. The prosecutor general's office said it would investigate whether speakers at the rally on Monday had provoked \"mass unrest\". Riot police detained hundreds of people who had refused to leave Moscow's Pushkin Square following an anti-Putin protest that gathered around 20,000 people. Among those detained were the opposition leaders Alexey Navalny and Sergei Udaltsov. They were released hours later. Navalny's court date has been set for 15 March. \"Investigators are currently studying videotapes of the events that happened on Pushkin Square, questioning participants in the protest and police officers that were securing the public order,\" prosecutors said in a statement. If charges are brought, the guilty could face up to two years in jail. Police have already swooped on other activists. Six members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot were arrested at the weekend, suspected by police of \"gross violation of the public order and religious hatred\" following an unsanctioned performance in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Two remain in custody, and have launched a hunger strike. They could face up to seven years in jail if police bring charges of hooliganism. Protesters also suspected that the campaign against them had been taken to the internet. Dr Web, a Russian IT security firm, said it had flagged a new computer virus sent in emails calling on people to attend the protests. Also on Tuesday, Andrew Ryvkin, a political blogger for the Russian edition of GQ, said he was attacked by two men known for their pro-Kremlin views. The writer Sergei Minayev and Eduard Bagirov, a member of Putin's election campaign, admitted to the attack on Twitter, but said that it involved \"no politics\". Despite the pressure, protesters have vowed to continue their calls for new elections. A fresh protest has been set for 10 March, but organisers have yet to receive approval from city authorities. After the attempt to occupy Pushkin Square, organisers indicated that they may carry out unsanctioned protests in future. \"It is necessary to start a movement to return to us the city that we live in,\" they wrote on their Facebook page. \"There is currently no authority in Moscow that represents the interests of Muscovites.\" Putin has refused to address the protesters' concerns, saying on Tuesday that the fraud claims were \"an element of political struggle. It has no relation to the election.\" \"Putin doesn't really believe that something changed,\" said Andrei Soldatov, an analyst specialising in the Russian security services. \"He clearly doesn't understand what happened in September.\" Although many Russians expected Putin to seek a return to the Kremlin, popular anger grew with his announcement in September that he would run for re-election. \"Putin will try to return the situation to as it was before, in the summer of 2011,\" Soldatov said. \"But I don't think that's possible.\" He said sources inside the security services were becoming increasingly nervous that the opposition would seek to capitalise on a fresh expression of discontent during Putin's planned inauguration in early May. Akunin, the novelist, said the authorities' nervousness was palpable, prompting the show of force on Monday. \"Putin's victory in the first round is becoming more and more doubtful,\" he said. Activists and election monitors continued to pore over reports of falsifications, revealing rates in the troubled Caucasus republics that rarely dipped below 97% support for Putin. \"I think exactly this explains the authorities' nervousness,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "According to the latest CEO survey by PwC, the \"talent challenge\" has become critical to the competitive position of businesses. Finding, attracting, deploying, developing, engaging and retaining the right people to create organisational effectiveness and success is now not just a lever of advantage but key to long term survival for many organisations. The penny seems to have dropped \u2013 if you don't have the staff, you don't have an organisation. CEOs realise this across business units and functions, and countries. If people are so important, why is there evidence that they are not being nurtured, and protected and sustained as you would normally do with your most precious resource? One disturbing recent image is of Chinese workers at Apple's iPad supplier Foxconn hanging out of their factory apartments above suicide nets, the firm trying to ensure that no more workers end their life, at least not on their premises. The factory owner in the news report states quite candidly that if it had not been for the spate of suicides, work conditions in the factory would not have been addressed. Quite probably, Apple would also not have intervened, clearly understanding the ramifications on its own reputation and realising that these employees are effectively their responsibility too. So does it take the deaths of employees for firms to notice that they have responsibility towards them? This is not just a problem in emerging economies. Developed nations continue to see employee health, wellbeing and safety compromised on almost routine basis. From CEO's through to the most junior staff, health &amp; wellbeing is increasingly recognised as a widespread problem. And a typical response is a softer version of the suicide net such as the use of employee assistance programmes, onsite massage therapy, or workplace 'chill out zones' to try and prevent symptoms arising, but not necessarily addressing the causes of any erosion in health. The 2012 survey of the UK workforce by King's College London and Speechly Bircham found that longer working hours are still increasing and that smaller, stretched workforces are causing problems for firms and their employees. The impact of higher workloads and uncertain business environments include higher levels of stress, absenteeism, presenteeism (the act of attending work while sick) and staff turnover. While some more positive findings show that firms which use flexible work arrangements and provide greater autonomy to their people can potentially mitigate these problems, the general picture is not pretty. Presenteeism has emerged as a serious HR issue. More employees are feeling compelled to come to work when ill due to the uncertain economic climate and fears of job security. 25% of organisations saw presenteeism increase in 2011, while 41% anticipate that it will increase again for 2012. It appears that leaders and managers remain largely ignorant or unconcerned about the scale of the problem, in contrast to absenteeism, where organisations tend to be more focused in finding ways to avoid paying people while they are away from work and unproductive. However, according to Professor Gary Johns, presenteeism is a much worse problem. \"There is considerable agreement across [academic] studies that presenteeism accounts for more aggregate productivity loss than absenteeism.\" The message here is that people do not work well when they are ill, that ill health is prolonged when they come to work, and that their ill health can also affect other team members. Not only is this a serious employee health issue that firms should address, it also has potentially significant implications on business performance. Ironically, aggressive strategies to reduce absence can also drive presenteeism, as staff come to work in fear of the implications of their absence upon their own job security or their own professional standing and reputation. Driving down one problem could create a bigger one. There is also a legal dimension. In the UK organisations have a duty to ensure health, safety and welfare at work of their employees. This includes ensuring employees do not work excessive hours and take suitable breaks; minimising risk of infections and stress-related illness. The general lack of concern about health and wellbeing in organisations is further highlighted by findings which show that a number of HR challenges such as employer branding are ranked higher in terms of priority than the health and wellbeing of staff. Only 31% of organisations reported the health and wellbeing of staff as a key priority. And while most organisations cite employee engagement as a key HR challenge, there has been a sharp fall in taking initiative. Employee engagement scores in many organisations remain high, possibly creating a false sense of wellbeing \u2013 it is certainly unlikely in the current environment that it is because staff are happy. More likely is that they have little choice but to pretend to being commited. Organisations that have higher workloads and lean workforces erode wellbeing. This is counterproductive and should worry all leaders, managers and HR teams. Above all else, a lack of focus on health and wellbeing is likely to undermine any ability to create a highly engaged and sustainable workforce that can leverage competitive advantage. As Mikaal Abdulla, CEO of a high profile financial services startup in Asia argues: \"Your employee's wellbeing and security should be on the top of your agenda. This is one of the most important investments you can make that shows your team you are serious about building a company for the long-term. [Also] give your team the freedom to balance their life and work. If someone has to go out for an hour, don't keep tabs. Let people have some downtime during the day, go out for a coffee, or surf the internet. Nobody can be productive from morning to night. Without small mental breaks productivity is killed anyway.\" Stuart Woollard is director of the King's College London Management Learning Board This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "Sir Paul McCartney has made some comments about fame and, more specifically, how it has changed since he first sprang into the public eye back in the 60s. He singled out the widespread use of cameraphones as having a dramatic impact on the experience of being famous, saying: \"Sometimes I want to have a peaceful evening with my wife in a restaurant without every few seconds having to pose for a mobile phone photograph. And increasingly people just don't seem to understand that. That sometimes causes unpleasant scenes.\" Now, while I would never in a million years compare my level of fame to that of a member of the most beloved band of all time, I have to admit that I know what he means. These days pretty much everyone has a camera on their phone, and whereas once people would stop you and ask for an autograph, now they'll whip out their phone for a photo. Even for a D-list celeb like me that happens many times a day, so I can imagine that for a star like McCartney it's pretty overwhelming. Ninety-nine per cent of the time it's not a problem. Indeed, I'm incredibly thankful that people feel so positively about seeing me, and I'm well aware that it's the support of fans that means I even have a career. But on occasion people do cross the line, and it can leave me feeling anything from annoyed to a bit anxious. So here are a few tips for any would-be paparazzi out there. 1. Make sure you're not making a difficult situation worse I was out shopping with my two-year-old recently. She started to throw a tantrum in the shop (as little kids do) and, while I was in the middle of trying to deal with a screaming toddler, a woman came up and demanded a photo right there and then. I obliged of course but, frankly, not helpful. 2. Be polite and, at the very least, say hello Yesterday on the train a man walked right up to my seat, took a full face picture, and just walked off without saying a word. That's just rude. 3. Don't be scary A few days ago I was in a restaurant eating a pizza when someone tweeted me \"how's your pizza?\" I tweeted back \"it's delicious\" but it was weird not knowing who around me was watching me. I left quite soon after that. 4. Don't try to hide what you're doing Pretending you're taking a picture of your mate, when really you're taking one of me, is a pretty obvious tactic. It makes you look silly and me feel self-conscious. The thing about being in a show like Coronation Street is that it puts you right into people's living rooms, and very often they do feel like they know you, in a way that they probably don't feel about, say, Brad and Angelina. That's a real privilege for an actor, and the vast majority of contact with the fans is fantastic and rewarding (Corrie has some of the best fans in the world). It really is lovely when people take the time to stop you and tell you how much they like your work, and that more than makes up for the occasional ill-mannered person who doesn't seem to understand that you are an actual person, as opposed to an exhibit to be gawped at. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

He singled out the widespread use of cameraphones as having a dramatic impact on the experience of being famous, saying: \"Sometimes I want to have a peaceful evening with my wife in a restaurant without every few seconds having to pose for a mobile phone photograph.

      "bodyText": "One of the hoary old chestnuts of academic life is the contention that teaching plays second fiddle to research. To get on as an academic, it is argued that you should ditch teaching and instead, research and publish in high impact academic journals. But in an attempt to redress this inequity, the Higher Education Academy introduced National Teaching Fellowships NTFs in 2000. The National Teaching Fellowship Scheme is open to all higher education institutions in England, Northern Ireland and, since Autumn 2010, Wales. Each year up to 55 individual awards of \u00a310,000 are made to recognise individual excellence. And there are currently some 500 NTFs in total. During 2007 I was lucky enough to be awarded a National Teaching Fellowship. I have no doubt whatsoever that my fellowship was crucial to securing promotion to principal lectureship. It also brought me \u00a310,000 which enabled me to attend some wonderful events \u2013 most notably International Teaching and Learning Conferences in Edmonton, Canada and Rotorua (NZ). Furthermore, it gave me much greater confidence in what I do, particularly in relation to active and blended learning approaches. The quotes from students and others were humbling and a treasure in themselves. So how do you go about this? And is it worth the effort? The current competitive round of submissions need to be in by 21 March at high noon. First of all you have to be nominated by your university or college. In my case the fact that I had been awarded a University Teaching Fellowship, was the passport to institutional sponsorship. Once over this hurdle there are three more, that comprise the NTF application: \u2022 A 1,000 word letter of support from your institution \u2022 A statement of how the individual demonstrates excellence relevant to each of the three headline award criteria (5,000 words maximum) \u2022 A short CV of no more than 1,500 words The meat of the bid is the second item \u2013 a personal statement pitching against three criteria: evidence of individual excellence in enhancing and transforming the student learning experience; evidence of supporting colleagues and influencing support for student learning; and developing excellence in terms of continuing professional development related to teaching and learning. This is a beauty parade, in the sense that you must be prepared to blow your own trumpet; it's not for the shrinking violet. My own university (Gloucestershire) has 12 NTFs and we deliberately mentor colleagues bidding for a fellowship. So, mentors comment on draft material and help to assemble the supporting institutional statement. I certainly found this assistance invaluable. I was told that I could either go for the safer bet of a chronological story or I could adopt the riskier strategy of putting in something 'different'. I took the second tack and began my statement: \"Once upon a time....There was a young man who was brought up in North London. James was a child of the sixties \u2013 concerned about environmental apocalypse and overpopulation; influenced by the writings of Schumacher (Small is Beautiful) and Rachel Ward's Silent Spring.\" Ironically I hate the academic convention of not using 'I', but on this occasion chose to talk about myself in the third person. I would encourage others to endeavour to tell a compelling and personal story of their journey through teaching and learning. I would also say that short, glowing, quotes from students, graduates, colleagues and practitioners, help to flavour the submission. Once the bid goes in, there then follows...silence! So this year applicants will have to chew their fingernails from end March until July 4. It's a long wait, and by the time I heard, I was convinced that I hadn't been successful. As with the 2012 NTFs, I attended an awards ceremony at the Middle Temple in London; and was presented with my award by the universities minister. To improve your chances of getting to that dinner, here are my top tips: \u2022 Tell a compelling story tied to the selection criteria \u2022 Present supporting evidence: quotes from colleagues, students and graduates: \"Jo Fox is the Rolls Royce Phantom V of the history department. She is the lecturer that Harrods would sell.\" (History student 2006.) \u2022 Remember to accentuate individual excellence \u2013 in this arena good is not good enough \u2022 Seek out an NTF colleague to help and advise \u2022 Use this as an opportunity to reflect on what you do, why you do it and to set down your philosophy in relation to teaching and learning James Derounian is a principal lecturer in community development and local governance and National Teaching Fellow, University of Gloucestershire This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The slide in British business confidence has been laid bare by official statistics showing that spending on domestic acquisitions has slumped to its lowest level in almost two decades. UK businesses spent just \u00a37.6bn acquiring other UK businesses in 2011, the lowest amount since 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists attribute the drop to a lack of confidence in a UK recovery stalled by rising unemployment and stringent austerity measures. Those companies hoping to grow by acquisition appeared to be looking overseas for opportunities. The value of acquisitions abroad by UK companies was more than six times higher at \u00a350.8bn. That was the highest level since 2007, before the UK slid into recession. There has been a steady upward trend in both the number and value of acquisitions by UK companies abroad over the past two years, though both remain well below pre-crisis levels. Domestic acquisitions by UK companies have been generally subdued since the crisis, running well below pre-recession levels. Chris Williamson, chief economist at data specialist Markit, said that pattern reflected low confidence in the UK outlook. \"What we are seeing is that companies are increasingly seeking to make acquisitions abroad where they perceive returns on investment to be higher than in the UK. This is not surprising \u2013 UK growth prospects are weak given the outlook for employment, consumer spending and government spending, and importantly look set to remain weak for some years,\" he said. \"In contrast, growth in emerging markets will remain strong.

(Sherwood Anderson's Winesberg, Ohio is embedded in American literature because of Anderson's success in showing how the monotony of being so wretchedly normal isolates us and perverts our ability to communicate. Insert your own Rick Santorum joke here.) The very normalcy of Ohio, combined with some statistical superstition, is what makes it special. For those of you who will be watching tonight's returns with a drink in your hand and a desire to see double by the close of the polls, take a swig every time you hear that no Republican presidential candidate has won the office without winning Ohio. (Please have a designated driver.) That bit of trivia is meaningful, of course, only in so far as there are reasons why Ohio has been such a bellwether \u2013 and this is where its representativeness comes in. Demographically, Ohio is a completest patchwork of American socio-economic clusters. It has industry and agriculture, urban areas and suburban sprawl, high-tech and low-tech employers. It is whiter than the United States as whole \u2013 largely because of a lower-than-average Hispanic population \u2013 but its age distribution mirrors that of the country and average income is on the dot. Another measure that nicely symbolized Ohio is that it tracks national trends: in 1995, the largest employer in Ohio was General Motors. In 2011, it was Walmart. Ohio was hit slightly harder by the economic downturn, with a marginally higher unemployment rate and a more significant foreclosure rate \u2013 but it has recently seen economic improvements that make it a hopeful outlier in the quest for recovery. If you want to participate even more fully in that Super Tuesday drinking game, look to take a sip every time someone says \"microcosm\" in reference to the state. Does that mean that Ohio's results will help predict the outcome of the 2012 general election? Not really. It's unclear if the results will even have a significant impact on the GOP primary. With Santorum and Romney neck-and-neck in the polls, Ohio's delegate prize (66, the second largest awarded tonight) appears to be decisive, but the delegates will be doled out proportionally, so the rewards will be neck-and-neck as well \u2026 and Santorum's failure to file the paperwork allowing him to receive delegates in all 16 states prevents any sweep he might have had hope for. What's more \u2013 and more important \u2013 the math has begun to make Santorum's chances to actually wrest the nomination away from Romney a logical impossibility. ABC News has an analysis that puts it baldly: Santorum can get to the magic delegate number of 1,144 only if he wins every remaining primary (including those today) with over 50% of the votes state-wide and in each congressional district. Barring an act of God (undoubtedly Santorum's ultimate strategy), this simply will not happen. No matter how successful he turns out to be in states that are demographically friendly to him, or among the party's base \u2013 or in Ohio! \u2013 Santorum would have to win in states that show no sign of swinging his way, such as Utah and New Jersey. Still, it's worth paying attention to the Buckeye State. Who wins which county (the units that a state breaks down into, after the manner of the United States) may suggest the mood and preferences of the demographic blocks that make up the national electorate: if, for instance, Santorum does not pull out significant wins in blue-collar areas with large evangelical populations, we will see evidence that the culture wars are a losing proposition for the GOP. A minor cautionary note: Santorum vote totals could be affected by Democrats voting in the open primary with the intent of throwing a roadblock in Romney's path; I personally doubt that will be a significant factor. Romney's path isn't going to be smooth, anyway. Though Santorum can't get to 1,144 delegates himself, he and Newt Gingrich, if they both stay in the race, can keep Romney from getting there. Which, from a political journalist's standpoint is awesome: we won't have to write about things that are more complicated than an electoral horse race, like Iran and the eurozone crisis. It is also, obviously, awesome for Democrats. Already, Republican leaders (and Barbara Bush!) are bemoaning what the increasingly ugly contest is doing for the party as a whole, and polls show (pdf) these concerns are valid: 40% of all voters say the primaries have made them feel less favorable about the GOP.

I am thrilled to share this image of a young woman from Papua New Guinea -- a place I've been fascinated by ever since I was a child. As you can see, she is wearing a spectacular traditional costume, consisting of a dozen or more native bird species or their feathers.

I am sure there are more. How many bird species can you identify?

      "bodyText": "The civil service is going to have to change faster and more radically than at any time since the second world war. That is not an option but a necessity if we are to create a high-quality, high-morale and highly effective civil service. The alternative is a downward spiral of cuts, inadequate services ,and not only a demoralised civil service but also a disillusioned public angry about deteriorating services. That is the central theme of an open letter on civil service reform which the Institute for Government has just published. Of course, the civil service has never been static but has been subject to frequent calls for reform. Indeed, the current Whitehall is very different from 10, 20 or even 30 years ago; it is more diverse, more open to change and with a much wider range of skills and backgrounds than before. But that is not enough. Not only do serious weaknesses remain, in managing big projects and in securing value for money, but the pressures for change are greater than ever. Listen to Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, who gave his response to the IfG open letter at an Institute meeting this week along with Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service, and Francis Maude, the minister for the Cabinet Office. Sir Jeremy noted that, while the cuts in civil service numbers already amounted to as much as was achieved during the Thatcher years, the process was only about a quarter complete. Moreover, as the autumn statement made clear, spending austerity - and headcount reductions - will have to continue for longer than planned, for at least seven years, well into the next parliament. All three speakers agreed that this requires a continuous push for improvement. Three main points emerged. First, the quality of management information has to be improved. As Maude said, there needs to be better data in government since it is hard for ministers to know what is going on. This is the subject of a forthcoming IfG report. Second, policymaking has to be more ambitious and innovative, as Sir Jeremy noted that it was outsiders like Steve Hilton, the prime minister's outgoing policy strategist, who had been responsible for being fresh ideas like nudge, behavioural change and well-being into Whitehall. Sir Jeremy floated the possibility that policy development on new areas could be made contestable, by being thrown up to private sector or other groups. This idea, which has emerged from 10 Downing Street is being treated very much as an experiment.

      "body": "<p>The civil service is going to have to change faster and more radically than at any time since the second world war.</p> <p>That is not an option but a necessity if we are to create a high-quality, high-morale and highly effective civil service. The alternative is a downward spiral of cuts, inadequate services ,and not only a demoralised civil service but also a disillusioned public angry about deteriorating services.</p> <p>That is the central theme of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/mar/05/whitehall-reform-unprecedented-future\" title=\"\">open letter on civil service reform </a>which the Institute for Government <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/open-letter-two-challenges-and-opportunity\" title=\"\">has just published</a>. Of course, the civil service has never been static but has been subject to frequent calls for reform. Indeed, the current Whitehall is very different from 10, 20 or even 30 years ago; it is more diverse, more open to change and with a much wider range of skills and backgrounds than before.</p> <p>But that is not enough. Not only do serious weaknesses remain, in managing big projects and in securing value for money, but the pressures for change are greater than ever. Listen to Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, who gave <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/mar/06/whitehall-dismay-on-policy-outsourcing\" title=\"\">his response</a> to the IfG open letter at an Institute meeting this week along with Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service, and Francis Maude, the minister for the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>Sir Jeremy noted that, while the cuts in civil service numbers already amounted to as much as was achieved during the Thatcher years, the process was only about a quarter complete. Moreover, as the autumn statement made clear, spending austerity - and headcount reductions - will have to continue for longer than planned, for at least seven years, well into the next parliament.</p> <p>All three speakers agreed that this requires a continuous push for improvement. Three main points emerged. First, the quality of management information has to be improved. As Maude said, there needs to be better data in government since it is hard for ministers to know what is going on. This is the subject of a forthcoming IfG report.</p> <p>Second, policymaking has to be more ambitious and innovative, as Sir Jeremy noted that it was outsiders like Steve Hilton, the prime minister's outgoing policy strategist, who had been responsible for being fresh ideas like nudge, behavioural change and well-being into Whitehall. Sir Jeremy floated the possibility that policy development on new areas could be made contestable, by being thrown up to private sector or other groups. This idea, which has emerged from 10 Downing Street is being treated very much as an experiment.</p> <p>As significant, though less eye-catching, was the stress put by Maude on ministers being more involved in policy implementation, not just leaving it to others.</p> <p>Third, all the speakers stressed the need for permanent secretaries to be made more personally responsible and accountable\u2014in achieving value for money in their departments and in leading cross-Whitehall efficiency and reform efforts. Perhaps their individual performance goals could be made public.</p> <p>The key to these efforts is not what the centre desires or imposes but how far various departments and their permanent secretaries actively commit themselves to the joint effort; hence the emphasis on corporate and collaborative leadership.</p> <p>It was fascinating to see Maude on the same platform as Sir Jeremy and Sir Bob.

      "bodyText": "As the FTSE 100 recorded its biggest one day fall since 14 December on renewed fears about a Greek default and a global economic slowdown, the leading loser was Russian gold miner Polymetal. The company's shares slumped 64.5p to 951.5p after analysts at UBS moved from buy to neutral and cut their price target from \u00a314 to \u00a311. UBS slashed its earnings forecasts by 6% to 22% between 2012 and 2015, reflecting a cut in its forecast gold output since it believes output from the Amursk site is unlikely before 2013. UBS said: We view Polymetal as a high-quality name with an attractive 2010-15 estimated output compound annual growth rate of 11%, though we think this growth is largely priced in. Without catalysts such as a strong gold/silver price or expansion in reserves base, the stock is unlikely to outperform the sector in the short term. Mining shares were generally weaker in the wake of China cutting its growth forecasts on Monday. Fresnillo bucked the trend for much of the day after a 63% rise in full year profits, but finally caved in to close down 2p at \u00a318.30. Overall, growing concerns about Greece ahead of this week's deadline for agreement with its private bondholders, as well as poor European surveys and China's downgrade on Monday, left the FTSE 100 109.02 points lower at 5765.80. This left the leading index at its lowest level since 31 January. Germany and French markets were even worst hit, each down more than 3%. Josh Raymond at City Index said: March not always a great month for the FTSE. The last 11 years has seen March be a bearish month six times. When it's bearish, the average loss is 2.4%. There were only two risers in the leading index. Hargreaves Lansdown added 13.8p to459.1p despite its expected ejection from the leading index in this week's quarterly review, while BSkyB edged up 0.5p to 683.5p. Essar Energy, another due for demotion from the FTSE 100, fell 5.5p to 101.6p, while insurer Aviva lost 17.2p to 350.2p after Exane BNP Paribas moved its recommendation from neutral to underperform. Ahead of results on Thursday, Exane's Andy Hughes said: We have long seen Aviva as cheap but leveraged, but with the earnings power to pay down the high level of debt. We have changed our view on the group's earnings power. In the current low-yield, low-growth environment Aviva's earnings will be lower and cash flows under pressure. Declining earnings put more pressure on the group to further reduce debt leverage, in our opinion. In the meantime, Aviva's share price has re-rated based on the recovery in Italian government bonds over the last three months. Cape topped the FTSE 250 risers, up 15.9p to 445.3p after the industrial services group issued an upbeat outlook statement despite flat full year profits of \u00a369.4m. Both JP Morgan Cazenove and WH Ireland raised their target prices. But Centamin, a miner focused on Egypt, fell 7.3p to 79.2p as the company said it had temporarily stopped operations at its Sukari mine due to what it called \"illegal labour unrest.\" Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide lost 2.25p to 31.21p on doubts about whether Vodafone would end up bidding for the business after its earlier expression of interest, although India's Tata is still in the frame. Finally drug discovery company Summit rose nearly 2% to 7p after unveiling positive trial data for its programme targeting Alzheimer's disease. Analysts at its broker Singer Capital Markets said: The results announced today complement positive pre-clinical data highlighted over summer 2011, increasing the likelihood of Summit's candidate attracting a partner.",

Without catalysts such as a strong gold/silver price or expansion in reserves base, the stock is unlikely to outperform the sector in the short term. <br> </blockquote> <p>Mining shares were generally weaker in the wake of China cutting its growth forecasts on Monday. <strong>Fresnillo</strong> bucked the trend for much of the day after a 63% rise in full year profits, but finally caved in to close down 2p at \u00a318.30.</p> <p>Overall, growing concerns about Greece ahead of this week's deadline for agreement with its private bondholders, as well as poor European surveys and China's downgrade on Monday, left the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>109.02 points lower at 5765.80. This left the leading index at its lowest level since 31 January. Germany and French markets were even worst hit, each down more than 3%. Josh Raymond at City Index said:</p> <blockquote> March not always a great month for the FTSE. The last 11 years has seen March be a bearish month six times. When it's bearish, the average loss is 2.4%. </blockquote> <p>There were only two risers in the leading index. <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> added 13.8p to459.1p despite its expected ejection from the leading index in this week's quarterly review, while <strong>BSkyB</strong> edged up 0.5p to 683.5p.</p> <p><strong>Essar Energy</strong>, another due for demotion from the FTSE 100, fell 5.5p to 101.6p, while insurer <strong>Aviva</strong> lost 17.2p to 350.2p after Exane BNP Paribas moved its recommendation from neutral to underperform. Ahead of results on Thursday, Exane's Andy Hughes said:</p> <blockquote> We have long seen Aviva as cheap but leveraged, but with the earnings power to pay down the high level of debt. <br> We have changed our view on the group's earnings power. In the current low-yield, low-growth environment Aviva's earnings will be lower and cash flows under pressure. Declining earnings put more pressure on the group to further reduce debt leverage, in our opinion. In the meantime, Aviva's share price has re-rated based on the recovery in Italian government bonds over the last three months. </blockquote> <p><strong>Cape</strong> topped the FTSE 250 risers, up 15.9p to 445.3p after the industrial services group issued an upbeat outlook statement despite flat full year profits of \u00a369.4m. Both JP Morgan Cazenove and WH Ireland raised their target prices.</p> <p>But <strong>Centamin</strong>, a miner focused on Egypt, fell 7.3p to 79.2p as the company said it had temporarily stopped operations at its Sukari mine due to what it called \"illegal labour unrest.\"</p> <p><strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide</strong> lost 2.25p to 31.21p on doubts about whether Vodafone would end up bidding for the business after its earlier expression of interest, although India's Tata is still in the frame.</p> <p>Finally drug discovery company <strong>Summit</strong> rose nearly 2% to 7p after unveiling positive trial data for its programme targeting Alzheimer's disease. Analysts at its broker Singer Capital Markets said:</p> <blockquote> The results announced today complement positive pre-clinical data highlighted over summer 2011, increasing the likelihood of Summit's candidate attracting a partner. </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "Passengers on an Air France flight travelling from Paris to Bogot\u00e1 have spoken of how they thought they were going to die when the plane they were on plummeted towards the Atlantic ocean after a burning smell filled the cabin. Euclides and Rosa Montes, Colombians with British nationality travelling from London to Bogot\u00e1 via Paris, told the Guardian that people on board were \"saying their goodbyes to one another\" as the plane \u2013 an Airbus A340-300 \u2013 rapidly descended to within 2,000 feet of the sea to offload fuel. \"We looked out of the window and the sea was directly below us,\" said Euclides. \"Fuel was pouring out over the wings. We thought we were going to die.\" Another passenger on the plane, Eden Victoria Erlandsson, told the Swedish newspaper Expressen, that \"panic took over, the cabin crew were sweating and shouting, and people were crying and praying. It was total panic.\" Air France told the Guardian the atmosphere was \"tense\" after an alarm went off in the crew rest area, but said the reports of smoke in the cabin and panic were \"false\" and a \"gross exaggeration\". The flight, which was carrying hundreds of passengers, made an emergency landing on the Azores island of Terceira at about 1.30pm on Monday afternoon. After landing on a runway at Lajes airport on the tiny island, passengers claimed they were evacuated via emergency slides amid general chaos. Fire brigades and ambulances were scrambled to the scene. At least 50 of the Colombian nationals on board were reportedly refused permission to enter the Azores as they do not hold the required Shengen visa documentation. However, Air France said all passengers were transferred to hotels. After the incident some passengers questioned whether the flight should have taken off, after its departure was delayed for 34 minutes due to unspecified technical problems at Charles de Gaulle airport. Passengers claimed when flight AF422 finally took off from Charles de Gaulle at 11.24am the smell of burning was already apparent. Two hours into the flight the plane rapidly diverted, turning back to the nearest landing point available, after the alarm went off. However, Air France contested the version of events given by passengers. \"There was no smoke on board and no use of the emergency slides,\" said Air France spokeswoman Marina Tymen. \"After the fire alarm went off the masks came down and the plane was diverted. Another plane and crew were despatched to take the passengers on to Bogot\u00e1. This was all perfectly normal standard procedure according to the rules that apply not just to Air France but to any airline, even though it was a false alarm.\" \"I can say categorically: there was no smoke, there was no fire and the emergency slides were not deployed,\" she said. \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 6 March to include a response from Air France",

      "bodyText": "The last time I clapped eyes on Ubisoft's I Am Alive was when its teaser trailer was released ahead of E3 in 2008. It then dropped off the radar almost completely until news of its impending release started flitting about game websites at the end of last year. The promotional push behind it seemed miniscule, and even though a couple of previews sounded promising, the general consensus did not. After all, what is one to make of Triple-A game that went dark after its first trailer, only to resurface four years later as a download-only title that its publisher is keeping rather quiet about? Sounds like it's probably a dud, right? Well hang onto your hats, kids, because I Am Alive is arguably one of the strongest games that will see release this year. On paper it doesn't sound particularly original; it's packed with familiar elements such as platforming third-person combat, and its story is set in a lawless, broken future. But I Am Alive's developers have applied these familiar gaming tropes in a unique and compelling manner, resulting in a game that stealthily burrows under the player's skin and then begins to chill their blood with an ever-increasing sense of dread. The only respite against this horror comes in the form of empty-handed resignation. Players are likely to feel emotionally drained by the time the end credits roll. I Am Alive is set in a post apocalyptic future where a cataclysmic series of earthquakes known as The Event have reduced much of the US to a pile of rubble. The player takes on the role of a man named Adam who has spent a year since The Event trekking across the country to the fictional city of Haventon, to be reunited with his wife and child. As the game opens, Adam \u2013 a gaunt, dust-covered individual with a thousand-yard stare \u2013 is recording messages to his family on a video camera. He then begins clambering over the broken highway and pulverised cars and heads towards home. I Am Alive starts off as a slow-burner. Initially, as the player guides Adam through the collapsed city in the dust-bleached daylight, I Am Alive threatens to turn into a fairly standard dystopian adventure with some interesting free-climbing mechanics thrown into it. In what amounts to the game's opening tutorial, Adam navigates his way across a broken bridge by pulling himself up support columns, shimmying along ledges and balancing on beams \u2013 and it's here I Am Alive tosses its first curveball. Unlike every other free-running hero in gaming today, Adam is limited in the amount of energy he can exert on his vertical travels. A life-bar and a stamina-bar appear at the top of the game's HUD. The stamina bar decreases if the player makes Adam climb something or run (walking and standing still have no affect). If the stamina bar runs out while Adam is in mid-climb, the player has to frantically tap the right-trigger to force him to push on. This, however, decreases Adam's overall stamina over time. Once that runs out, Adam will fall to his death. As the stamina decreases, players are alerted to Adam's plight by the game's increasingly urgent orchestral score. Players can restore Adam's stamina with items such as water bottles and cans of soda. They can also restore his health with first aid kits and food. However, knowing when and where to use these items is crucial to Adam's survival and as the player slowly realises this, I Am Alive begins to stick the knife in. You see, the world of I Am Alive is an unforgiving and ruthless place. Food, water and other human necessities are in very short supply and, after the first hour, a dust storm covers the streets of Haventon, which makes foraging a potentially lethal activity. So for most of the game, players are urged to safeguard every useful item they come across. They should only use items from their inventory if they have no alternative, whether it's a can of food to restore their health or a piton they can gouge into a wall and take a breather on a long climb. This goes double for any bullets they find for Adam's gun, which is empty at the beginning of the game. The reason for this is because the only law in Haventon is the law of the jungle and the only other people Adam encounters are either predators or potential prey. The former roam in packs, killing anyone they come across and looting their bodies for food and supplies. When Adam encounters them, the player has the opportunity to lull attackers into a false sense of security and get an early quick-kill. Once the weapons are drawn, fights are short, sharp and tactical. If the player can take down any opponents armed with a gun first, they can threaten remaining foes with an empty gun and they may surrender. But if they find themselves being rushed by more than one opponent, and they're out of ammunition, they're dead. Adam will face more than just random attacks and looting, though. Over the course of its plot, I Am Alive presents players with a harrowing look into the dark side of the human psyche and the sort of horrific acts people are capable of when might-is-right becomes the rule of law. The moral depths that some of the people in Haventon have plummeted to are sickening, but the developers explore them in a way that is never cheap or tawdry. They always feel like realistic by-products that would occur after the collapse of civilisation. Not every human the player encounters will attack them on sight. Some simply threaten them until they back away. Other reach out to them for help, begging for an item \u2013 perhaps some food, or water, or bandages from the player's very rare and very hard-to-come-by first aid kit. Some may offer information about Adam's family in return for this help. Some may offer more. Most will ensure the player receives another \"re-try\" token that stops them from being dumped back into early stages of the game should Adam die. The player can choose to help them or not. I Am Alive doesn't force a choice on the player with these survivors. It simply puts someone in need in the player's path and leaves the decision up to them. Sometimes the player might not even have the item these survivors are after, while in other instances, they may decide that helping someone else comes secondary to their survival. Adam isn't some superhuman he-man who can hang indefinitely off the side of a building or machine gun his way through rooms full of enemies. He's a tired, haggard shell of a man and he's relatively easy to kill. It's a hard, brutal world and those who give charity too often don't survive in it. In this way, I Am Alive uses its post-apocalyptic environment far more effectively than many other games that share its nightmare vision of the future. I Am Alive joins games such as Fallout, RAGE and Left 4 Dead in its setting where a some horrendous event put paid to civilisation as we know it, but in truth, it's far closer in its atmosphere and aesthetic values to Cormac MacCarthy's grim post-apocalyptic novel, The Road. It takes a hard, unblinking look at how humans behave when social order is destroyed and then builds horror upon horror, allowing only the briefest glimpses of human decency to shine through. It's a work of art that speaks to the human condition. It shows us what we could become if we allowed our basest impulses to take over and what we could be if we cling to our humanity at all costs. It reminds us that there's more to being alive than simply surviving. \u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360",

Other reach out to them for help, begging for an item \u2013 perhaps some food, or water, or bandages from the player's very rare and very hard-to-come-by first aid kit. Some may offer information about Adam's family in return for this help. Some may offer more. Most will ensure the player receives another \"re-try\" token that stops them from being dumped back into early stages of the game should Adam die.</p> <p>The player can choose to help them or not. I Am Alive doesn't force a choice on the player with these survivors. It simply puts someone in need in the player's path and leaves the decision up to them. Sometimes the player might not even have the item these survivors are after, while in other instances, they may decide that helping someone else comes secondary to their survival.</p> <p>Adam isn't some superhuman he-man who can hang indefinitely off the side of a building or machine gun his way through rooms full of enemies. He's a tired, haggard shell of a man and he's relatively easy to kill. It's a hard, brutal world and those who give charity too often don't survive in it.</p> <p>In this way, I Am Alive uses its post-apocalyptic environment far more effectively than many other games that share its nightmare vision of the future. I Am Alive joins games such as Fallout, RAGE and Left 4 Dead in its setting where a some horrendous event put paid to civilisation as we know it, but in truth, it's far closer in its atmosphere and aesthetic values to Cormac MacCarthy's grim post-apocalyptic novel, The Road.</p> <p>It takes a hard, unblinking look at how humans behave when social order is destroyed and then builds horror upon horror, allowing only the briefest glimpses of human decency to shine through. It's a work of art that speaks to the human condition. It shows us what we could become if we allowed our basest impulses to take over and what we could be if we cling to our humanity at all costs. It reminds us that there's more to being alive than simply surviving.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "A homeless charity which specialises in helping destitute Scots who hit hard times in London has been thrown a lifeline, after the Church of Scotland won a meeting with Alex Salmond to raise its plight. The first minister has effectively reversed an earlier decision to cancel all Scottish government funding for the charity Borderline, a move which threatened the organisation with complete closure after 18 years helping homeless and stricken Scots in the city. This problem grew to crisis levels in the 1980s, when thousands of workless Scots left areas devastated by the collapse in heavy industries and headed to London searching for jobs and a new life. Often travelling through Victoria bus station, many became rough sleepers, and hit the drink and drugs. Set up by Church of Scotland ministers in London back in 1984, it was known to many as the \"Scottish embassy in London\". Now, rather than get a direct grant from Edinburgh, the charity will be given up to \u00a350,000 for the next three years from criminals' cash confiscated under proceeds of crime legislation. But those funds will be pegged to whatever the Church of Scotland itself can raise. So the new deal, brokered after the Moderator of the General Assembly David Arnott complained directly to Salmond, is far from unconditional. It puts the pressure on church congregations, many struggling to meet their own parish's needs, to raise enough money. Back in January, Willie Docherty, Borderline's chief executive, was furious. He said then Scottish government officials had made clear its funding was being withdrawn \u2013 after several years of decline \u2013 because it was being spent in London and not in Scotland, and times were hard. It had been getting \u00a3107,000 a year, but that was whittled down to \u00a324,500 for this year, to zero from next month. The charity does work no-one else will: it helps about 200 Scots a year, mostly men, find hostel beds, homes or work in London, or a ticket back home to Scotland. If it can, Docherty said, Borderline will make sure someone is at the other end to greet them. Arnott focused minds in the Scottish government by launching his own initiative, issuing an emergency fund-raising appeal to all 1,450 Church of Scotland congregations to each donate \u00a3100 immediately to ensure Borderline could stay open this summer. At the weekend, he presaged the Scottish government announcement on Monday by revealing the kirk had raised \u00a38,000 so far since mid-January \u2013 a figure the Scottish government ought to match. Yet there was a touch of wariness about the difficulties of finding \u00a350,000 a year from kirk congregations from Arnott on Monday, when he said: It is crucial that the Scottish community stands together to ensure that no vulnerable Scot in London is without the support they need. The Church of Scotland is willing to do what it can and I am delighted the first minister has stated the Scottish government will match whatever congregations raise. A Church of Scotland spokesman suggested the kirk was more bullish about hitting that target than might appear. He said: Just to reaffirm, we have already managed to raise around \u00a38,000 in a short space of time and are very optimistic about our prospects of raising the \u00a350,000 needed the trigger the Scottish government's \u00a350,000 contribution in each of the next three years. Docherty added to the moderator's wider appeal, warning this deal was a just a temporary fix: There is a great need for support for vulnerable homeless Scots in London and had we not received this grant, it is highly likely that the Borderline would have closed its doors within months. Recognition by the Scottish government that there is a need for this kind of support in London and re-instating our funding is very welcome. However, this is only a stepping stone as we still require to enlist the support of more Scots generally, and here in London in particular, to ensure the long term future of our service to homeless Scots in London. Referring to the continuing funding of homeless groups within Scotland, Keith Brown, the Scottish housing minister, said: In the face of deep cuts to our budget from Westminster we continue to fund a wide range of initiatives to help tackle homelessness. That is why it is good news we have been able to find this money for Borderline, which I hope will make a real difference for Scots who have fallen on hard times in London.",

      "bodyText": "For years Zooey Deschanel has skirted round the edges of mass fame, the doe-eyed indie pin-up, repeatedly cast as a wise-cracking companion or whimsical dream girl (and sometimes both). Now, at 32, suddenly Deschanel finds herself centre stage. Her comedy New Girl \u2013 which was the most watched show on Channel 4's on-demand service in January \u2013 is, she says, reviving a grand American heritage of sitcom centred on a female character. It revolves around a group of male flatmates who find their merry existence disrupted by the arrival of a female room-mate (Deschanel's character, Jess), a schoolteacher, given to occasional bouts of singing and who gets entangled in complicated situations. Two weeks into the first series, a further 11 episodes were commissioned (bringing the total to 24) and are currently airing in the US. Golden Globe nominations have swiftly followed \u2014 including a Best Actress nod for Deschanel. \"I get sent a lot of scripts, but this one stood out,\" she says down the line from LA. \"The writing was quirky and I loved the character \u2013 I liked that there was a lot of physical stuff, that she was completely herself always, and that they hung a lot of the comedy on her. We do have that tradition of female-driven sitcoms like Roseanne and I Love Lucy and the Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" It is to this last example that she feels New Girl most easily compares. \"Most sitcoms are joke-driven and less emotional. But ultimately this show isn't about one-liners, it's about situations. I think the show's a little bit like a movie in that way.\" New Girl was written by playwright and screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether, who was inspired by her own turbulent experiences of Craigslist flat-shares. \"She's amazing,\" Deschanel says. \"She's the head writer on the show, and ultimately it's her creation, but it's a very collaborative environment, rather than the power-flip thing you get sometimes on a project. I think maybe it's because we're around the same age, and we're sort of peers. We have a lot of friends in common \u2013 we first met randomly at a Superbowl party last year.\" The two women work together well, she says, because \"it's more like a discussion, a lot of back-and-forth, and you have a lot of the same cultural reference points, so you have a kind of shorthand.\" Meriwether is often grouped with female screenwriters including Diablo Cody (Juno), Dana Fox (What Happens in Vegas) and Lorene Scafaria (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist) as \"the Fempire\". The term was coined light-heartedly, but seems to reflect a gender shift in the largely male-dominated world of US film and television, with an increasing number of projects written, produced and directed by women, and many of the characters and storylines being female-focused. \"Yes!\" bawls Deschanel. \"I really do feel that for a long time women didn't have the place in comedy that they should. I mean, I've had some amazing roles, but when you get sent scripts and you see you're always playing someone's girlfriend when you want to be the central role, it's so depressing. As a comedienne, it felt so frustrating to always be setting up someone else's comedic moments.\" The change, she believes, began with the success of Bridesmaids, the 2011 film written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, and starring Wiig as a somewhat troubled maid of honour. The scenario was not revolutionary, but the comedy, and portrayal of female friendship, was honest and fresh and strikingly funny. \"Bridesmaids' success meant that a lot of the networks realised people were interested in that kind of comedy,\" Deschanel explains. \"We already had our show in production, but it made the networks pay more attention. You know the 2010-2011 pilot season was diametrically opposed to the 2012 pilot season; it was all these male-dominated shows. But in 2012, what got picked up were all these female-driven shows.\" \"The Fempire\" now seems to extend to the stars of these new series. \"I am friends with all the women on these shows,\" she says proudly. \"It's this great atmosphere \u2013 we all support each other. When there aren't enough roles for women then of course it gets competitive. But right now, it's wonderful.\" The ring of satisfaction is all the greater for Deschanel, as she had been pushing for this shift; last spring, she and two friends \u2013 producer Sophia Rossi and writer Molly McAleer \u2013 launched an entertainment website, HelloGiggles, aimed principally at women. \"There were no websites for my comedic tastes,\" she says. \"Sites like Funny or Die and College Humor are great, but I'd say it's appealing to 80% men and 20% women. On HelloGiggles we make stuff for guys too, of course, but it's more weighted towards the female, maybe it's even just to females of a certain generation, but it's to our sensibility.\" She pauses and recasts: \"But I'm not trying to say there is male humour or female humour, I want to step back from saying that.\" HelloGiggles is one of Deschanel's many off-screen enterprises. She also developed a (now-suspended) show for HBO based on Pamela Des Barres' groupie autobiography I'm With the Band. She hopes one day to write and produce and direct, and to continue her music career \u2013 at one time part of an LA-based jazz cabaret act, Deschanel joined up with musician M Ward in 2008 to release an album as the duo She &amp; Him. Since then, there has been a second record and a Christmas album, and while her schedule is constraining, the pair have further plans to work together. \"Obviously I won't be able to tour in the same way,\" she says, \"but we'll still be able to record \u2026 hopefully.\" There is suddenly a vague wistfulness to Deschanel's tone, as if she recognises the changes that New Girl's success is bringing to her life \u2013 surrendering the delights of indie obscurity for crazy schedules and mainstream fame. There are definite drawbacks to her new-found recognition: in February, gossip columns reported that the newly single Russell Brand was in hot pursuit (she is separated from her husband, Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie). Brand, the tittle-tattlers claimed, had been bombarding her with calls and flirty texts. \"That's complete fabrication!\" she cries with exasperation. \"I don't even know him! I maybe met him once, in passing, four years ago. And he definitely doesn't have my phone number! That was a story made up by a single website. It's crazy how that got picked up \u2014 I mean how does that even happen?\" Deschanel huffs with frustration. She is composed, still, and bright-voiced, but perhaps just a little dazzled by all the new craziness unfolding. New Girl is on Channel 4 on Fridays at 8.30pm",

      "body": "<p>For years <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/zooeydeschane\" title=\"\">Zooey Deschanel</a> has skirted round the edges of mass fame, the doe-eyed indie pin-up, repeatedly cast as a wise-cracking companion or whimsical dream girl (and sometimes both). Now, at 32, suddenly Deschanel finds herself centre stage. Her comedy <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/new-girl/4od\" title=\"\">New Girl</a> \u2013 which was the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/the-new-girl-at-channel-4-tops-the-4od-chart-for-january\" title=\"\">most watched show on Channel 4's on-demand service in January</a> \u2013 is, she says, reviving a grand American heritage of sitcom centred on a female character. It revolves around a group of male flatmates who find their merry existence disrupted by the arrival of a female room-mate (Deschanel's character, Jess), a schoolteacher, given to occasional bouts of singing and who gets entangled in complicated situations. Two weeks into the first series, a further 11 episodes were commissioned (bringing the total to 24) and are currently airing in the US. Golden Globe nominations have swiftly followed \u2014 including a Best Actress nod for Deschanel.</p> <p>\"I get sent a lot of scripts, but this one stood out,\" she says down the line from LA. \"The writing was quirky and I loved the character \u2013 I liked that there was a lot of physical stuff, that she was completely herself always, and that they hung a lot of the comedy on her. We do have that tradition of female-driven sitcoms like Roseanne and I Love Lucy and the <a href=\"http://www.mtmshow.com/\" title=\"\">Mary Tyler Moore Show</a>.\"</p> <p>It is to this last example that she feels New Girl most easily compares. \"Most sitcoms are joke-driven and less emotional. But ultimately this show isn't about one-liners, it's about situations. I think the show's a little bit like a movie in that way.\"</p> <p>New Girl was written by playwright and screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/liz-meriwether\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Meriwether</a>, who was inspired by her own turbulent experiences of Craigslist flat-shares. \"She's amazing,\" Deschanel says. \"She's the head writer on the show, and ultimately it's her creation, but it's a very collaborative environment, rather than the power-flip thing you get sometimes on a project. I think maybe it's because we're around the same age, and we're sort of peers. We have a lot of friends in common \u2013 we first met randomly at a Superbowl party last year.\" The two women work together well, she says, because \"it's more like a discussion, a lot of back-and-forth, and you have a lot of the same cultural reference points, so you have a kind of shorthand.\"</p> <p>Meriwether is often grouped with female screenwriters including Diablo Cody (Juno), Dana Fox (What Happens in Vegas) and Lorene Scafaria (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist) as \"the Fempire\". The term was coined light-heartedly, but seems to reflect a gender shift in the largely male-dominated world of US film and television, with an increasing number of projects written, produced and directed by women, and many of the characters and storylines being female-focused.</p> <p>\"Yes!\" bawls Deschanel. \"I really do feel that for a long time women didn't have the place in comedy that they should. I mean, I've had some amazing roles, but when you get sent scripts and you see you're always playing someone's girlfriend when you want to be the central role, it's so depressing. As a comedienne, it felt so frustrating to always be setting up someone else's comedic moments.\"</p> <p>The change, she believes, began with the success of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/23/bridesmaids-review\" title=\"\">Bridesmaids</a>, the 2011 film written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, and starring Wiig as a somewhat troubled maid of honour. The scenario was not revolutionary, but the comedy, and portrayal of female friendship, was honest and fresh and strikingly funny.</p> <p>\"Bridesmaids' success meant that a lot of the networks realised people were interested in that kind of comedy,\" Deschanel explains. \"We already had our show in production, but it made the networks pay more attention. You know the 2010-2011 pilot season was diametrically opposed to the 2012 pilot season; it was all these male-dominated shows.

Despite vociferous objections from English Heritage and other conservation groups, the council's planning committee granted permission for Liverpool Waters, the UK's biggest planning application. English Heritage's formal objection means the scheme will automatically be referred to the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, who will decide whether to hold a public inquiry or allow the project to go ahead. In January, a delegation from Unesco concluded that the skyscraper proposal would result in \"a serious loss of historic authenticity\". The inspectors praised the \"more or less symmetrical profile\" of the city's waterfront, with the Three Graces \u2013 the Port of Liverpool and the Liver and Cunard buildings \u2013 at centre stage and historical docklands to the north complementing those to the south. The Graces were \"at the heart of the shipping and harbour operations during the height of [Liverpool's] glory, surrounded by dockyards and port structures,\" they said. The \u00a35.5bn Peel Holdings development would \"[relegate] the Three Graces to playing second violin \u2026 thereby losing an important visual and historical reference to the city's glorious past.\" The council leader, Joe Anderson, said Liverpool was not a museum and investment was crucial to the city's future. \"Today's decision to grant planning permission for Liverpool Waters is one of the most significant and far-reaching made in Liverpool's recent history. It is a vote of confidence in a new beginning of a great city,\" he said. \"Liverpool has to grow and redevelop if we are to thrive and succeed in the future. We do not live in the past, we are not a museum. I care passionately about the future of Liverpool and the opportunities and life chances we give our children. \"Today's decision is for future generations. The new investment, businesses and employment opportunities Liverpool Waters will bring is the future for our city.\" The Liverpool Waters plans feature 9,000 flats, hundreds of offices, hotels, bars and a cruise terminal, as well as the 55-storey Shanghai Tower and other high-rises. It involves two clusters of tall buildings, one near the city centre and a second further north. English Heritage said it was disappointed by the decision and unhappy with the council's assessment which, it said, downplayed the adverse impacts of the development on Liverpool's heritage. It said the scheme would \"severely compromise\" the setting of some of Liverpool's most significant historic buildings, risk damaging the archaeological remains of parts of the docks and unbalance the city's urban landscape. Henry Owen-John, planning director for the north-west at English Heritage, said: \"The decision is in no way a surprise because it has been presented very much as a choice between jobs and growth on one side and heritage on the other. We are really disappointed that it has been presented like that because we have always believed that it was possible to develop a scheme that maximised heritage and developed jobs and growth.\"",

      "bodyText": "Some love him, others mistrust him but few dispute London mayor Boris Johnson's gift for making his mark. No policy of the celebrity Conservative politician has demonstrated this more conspicuously than the 6,000 bulky, blue, Barclays-sponsored bicycles for hire he has brought to the centre of the capital. Johnson, himself a highly recognisable cyclist, has made the scheme \u2013 Barclays Cycle Hire (BCH) \u2013 a flagship policy for what he calls his cycling revolution in the capital, proclaiming it a \"glorious new form of public transport\". The bikes and the more than 400 docking stations from which users collect and return them have become familiar sights in central London since their introduction in July 2010. On Thursday the scheme will be extended eastwards to within a 15-minute walk of the Olympic Park, with a further 160 docking stations across the East End hosting a further 2,300 bikes. Yet as his campaign to retain the mayoralty at the 3 May election intensifies, critics are questioning the success of \"Boris Bikes\". Transport for London (TfL), the public body responsible for running the scheme, says 137,000 people have active membership accounts, though these include people who might not have used their membership key to hire a bike for many months. Numbers of casual users, who hire by swiping a credit card at a docking station terminal point, varied last year between 48,379 in January and 240,000 in July. About 20,000 hires altogether are made each weekday and 13,000-15,000 at weekends. Johnson's election campaign website boasts of \"nearly 10m hires\" since launch. However, a customer satisfaction survey conducted for TfL by Ipsos Mori last summer found the scheme's novelty had worn off for many of its members with cyclists becoming \"more critical of the BCH offer\". There was growing dissatisfaction over bike maintenance and finding docking stations full when attempting to return the cycles. Early teething problems with the system, run for TfL by Serco, had meant that casual users could not access it until December 2010 and nearly 2,800 people were incorrectly charged during its first five months, though TfL says such problems are now long solved. The survey also found that more than half of members are men aged 35-54, that only 71% live in London and that nearly half used the bikes for commuting, primarily instead of walking or taking the tube. It also found 93% of all Boris Bikes trips lasted less than half an hour, which is a free period after casuals and members have paid an access fee. Jenny Jones, the Green party's London mayoral candidate and a regular cyclist, said: \"Cycle hire is a brilliant idea but the London scheme has been hijacked by corporate interests.\" She also said it was unambitious compared with Paris's much larger V\u00e9lib scheme. She cites TfL figures to claim it has generated only 3% of the extra 1m daily cycle trips the mayor is committed to seeing by 2026, compared with 2000. At the first mayoral election hustings both the Labour candidate Ken Livingstone and Liberal Democrat Brian Paddick attacked the cost of the scheme, which Johnson pledged in his 2008 transport manifesto would be delivered at no cost to the taxpayer through \"a deal with a private company.\" Yet Barclays' contribution has offset only an undisclosed fraction of TfL's outlay. When the deal was announced in May 2010 it was described by TfL as being worth \"up to\" \u00a325m over five years with the sum also contributing to the \"Barclays cycle superhighways\" Johnson has begun introducing on some main commuter routes. The cost of installing the first phase of the scheme was \u00a379.5m. Only \u00a33.4m had been received from Barclays by the end of 2010. Last July Johnson applauded Barclays' agreeing to \"provide another \u00a325m sponsorship,\" extending its support to 2018 and planned further expansion into west and south London next year. But in November he said the \"anticipated total operational and project cost\" over the following five years for the first two phases of the scheme was \u00a3140.5m, and that over the life of the contract with Barclays there was \"a potential\" of \u00a350m in sponsorship. Johnson added: \"The profiling and detail of the payment of the sponsorship is commercially sensitive.\" A report by the London Assembly transport committee last month criticised the process by which Barclays was selected as a sponsor as \"almost totally opaque\". Johnson has enjoyed a close relationship with Barclays throughout his mayoralty, appointing the bank's now global chief executive Bob Diamond the first chair of his charitable Mayor's Fund for London in 2008. Diamond has since stepped down but Barclays Capital is a \"strategic partner\" of the fund. BBC London last year reported that he had made \"a personal approach\" to Barclays chairman Marcus Agius about sponsoring the scheme and that other high street banks were not sounded out. Three advertising consultants put the publicity value of the deal to Barclays, whose name and Barclays blue corporate colour adorns the bikes and docking points, at \u00a39m-\u00a315m a year. But Johnson and TfL have always insisted the deal is good value for money in tough economic times. The original colour of the signage and roundels for the scheme was mint green, but was changed to Barclays blue as part of the deal. TfL has always denied that the blue paint used to mark the cycle superhighway lanes was chosen because of its similarity to the Barclays hue, saying it was settled on at least three months before Barclays came on board. London's boroughs are now being asked to help fund the scheme's growth. Citizen journalists at MayorWatch and the Shepherd's Bush blog have disclosed that Tower Hamlets, Wandsworth and Hammersmith &amp; Fulham are each required to provide \u00a32m. TfL puts annual operating costs at \u00a315m a year, rising to \u00a320m with phase 2. Johnson wants these to break even by 2015, but TfL is forecasting only \u00a37m income from users by the end of this financial year. Come 3 May Londoners' votes may be swayed by whether they consider Boris Bikes to be the triumph Johnson says they are \u2013 or a taxpayer-subsidised advertising vehicle for Barclays and the Tory mayor.",

      "bodyText": "A few hours after Mum died, we sent her body to Southampton and back, a round trip of 70 miles. That sounds like a curious thing to do at a moment of great family distress and it certainly felt fairly weird at the time. But the posthumous journey was necessary if we were to honour Mum's long-held desire for her body to be used after death for medical research. We had arranged for NHS scientists to take her brain for investigation and experiment, but on the day she died we encountered a series of obstacles that looked likely to stop them receiving it. Mum's name was Florence Carvel and she died aged 92 \u2013 the oldest by far of any member of our family. She lived resolutely in her own home until dementia took hold. After a medical crisis and a spell in hospital, she spent the last year and a bit in a care home. During her final days, when the dementia finally got the better of her, we knew she did not have much longer to live. In the nick of time, we set about finding out how to implement her wishes. The journey to Southampton was unexpected. There were several mortuaries close to the care home where she spent her final months. Any one of them could have performed the postmortem. The Brain Bank for Neurodegenerative Diseases at King's College London had completed all the paperwork and had the signatures that were required to legitimise the procedure. Its courier was ready to come to take her brain to the lab where it would be preserved for subsequent investigation. A brain donation should be completed soon after death to keep the proteins intact. Ideally, the extraction should be done on the day of death, although tissue taken within three days is still of scientific value. But, on the day Mum died, the brain bank's administrator hit a brick wall. A senior technician in the nearest local authority mortuary refused to perform the postmortem, as was his right. A pathologist at a nearby NHS district general hospital offered to extract Mum's brain, but her superiors told her not to, suggesting (probably inaccurately) that it was not licensed by the Human Tissue Authority to do this work. For the brain bank, such obstacles are a fairly regular frustration. It has the funds to pay the NHS or local authorities (mortuary services may be provided by either) for the services of the pathologists. It also recompenses undertakers who will take the deceased to and from the postmortem. The Medical Research Council, which funds a network of brain banks, including the one at King's College London, says the banks are making a huge contribution to progress in the neurosciences. For example, the discovery of deficient dopamine levels in the brains of patients who had Parkinson's disease led to the development of l-dopa treatment. Other areas of medicine to benefit include research into Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. Mum's older brother Ernest had Parkinson's disease and died in his early 60s. He had wanted to donate his body for research to help find a cure. On his deathbed he asked Mum to make sure this happened. But Ernest's wife objected and his wish went unfulfilled. Mum bitterly regretted that. Through the donation of her brain, we would go some way towards honouring the memory of her brother as well as her wishes for herself. It took on massive importance because it was the last thing we could do for her. She died in the early hours and the brain bank's administrator spent the morning trying in vain to find a local mortuary for the postmortem. He called to say he was having to look further afield and warn us of a potential snag. Fear of reprisals Some NHS mortuaries will not conduct postmortems without documentary evidence that the death had been officially registered, although this is not a legal requirement. Trusts are entitled to make up their own rules. Some are happy to help the cause of dementia research by allowing their staff to conduct postmortems without documentation, as long as costs are covered by the brain bank. Others fear reprisals. What if the removal of a brain destroyed evidence of a crime? However, surely a pathologist who removes a brain for research is not destroying evidence, but preserving it? Waiting until after the death has been registered may allow the evidence to degrade. These were not the questions confronting us on the day Mum died. The first task was to see the GP to pick up the certificate showing cause of death. We were then fortunate to get an early appointment with the registrar, in a town a few miles away. She signed the death certificate and gave us the green form that is normally required to give authority for burial or cremation. We hurried to fax it to the brain bank. While we were rushing around, the brain bank administrator finally found a willing pathologist in the mortuary at Southampton general hospital. With our approval, he asked the undertakers to take Mum there and wait while her brain was removed. The brain bank courier set off for Southampton. By evening, Mum was back, minus her brain, which was being preserved at King's College in London. Dr Claire Troakes, co-ordinator of the brain bank at King's College London, says the main reason that relatives are having to jump through hoops to make sure that medical research has the tissue needed for scientific discovery is a shortage of staff. \"This is not work the mortuaries are obliged to do. We depend on their goodwill and, often, individual members of staff respond brilliantly. We have had mortuary technicians going back in to work at 8pm on a Friday night after putting the kids to bed. We've even had a postmortem carried out for us over Christmas. \"What we have been finding recently is that some trusts are saying we can go ahead only when the death certificate has been signed. And some are asking for the death to have been registered and the green form obtained. We have not had to decline a donation because of this yet, but colleagues in some other areas have. We have been able to find sympathetic GPs and registrars within the three-day timescale. But it is involving the family a lot more than we would have wished. We would like to make the arrangements and leave the family alone to grieve.\" From my family's perspective, the solution seems clear. The Department of Health, with the agreement of coroners and the Ministry of Justice, should issue guidelines encouraging NHS trusts to carry out prompt brain donation postmortems, without prior sight of a death certificate. Dementia affects 750,000 people across Britain and the number is forecast to reach one million by 2021. The cost is \u00a320bn a year \u2013 more than cancer and heart disease combined \u2013 and rising fast. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, says: \"Research using brain tissue is vital if we are to understand what causes dementia, develop better treatments and eventually find a cure. One in three people over 65 will die with dementia and yet there is eight times less spent on dementia research than cancer research. We must invest now and it is vital that people continue to donate.\" Improving care David Stout, NHS Confederation deputy chief executive, says: \"We know that dementia has a huge impact on the NHS \u2026 Increasing our knowledge of its cause and development is a crucial part of improving the care we provide to people living with the condition. Organ research is an important part of this. The NHS should do whatever it can to support this work.\" Florence looked peaceful as she lay in the coffin before the funeral. We could not see any traces of the postmortem. It was good that she got what she wanted and, who knows, she may play a part in making a medical breakthrough. \u2022 Does your family have experience of brain donation?

      "bodyText": "The former New Zealand cricket captain Chris Cairns has angrily denied allegations of match-fixing during a libel trial at the high court in London. Cairns said repeatedly \"I am not a cheat\" as he was cross-examined by the QC acting for Lalit Modi, the ex-chairman of the Indian Premier League. Cairns is suing Modi over what he described as an \"unequivocal allegation\" of match-fixing made on Twitter. The retired international cricketer claims that his achievements have been turned to \"dust\" by Modi's claim, made on the social network in January 2010. Modi is defending the action on the grounds of justification, maintaining that the charge is true. Cairns repeatedly denied various allegations put to him by Ronald Thwaites QC, for Modi, under hours of questioning on the second day of the judge-only trial in London. The court heard that Cairns denied to directors of the Indian Cricket League in October 2008 that he was involved in match fixing. \"It was dressed as my name along with others \u2026 I refuted it and we moved on,\" Cairns said. \"My answer is, I am not a cheat. Sir, I am not a cheat.\" Cairns was paid $1m (\u00a3640,000) as captain of the Chandigarh Lions in three competitions in the now-defunct Indian Cricket League (ICL) between 2007 and 2008, the court was told. Modi's allegation of match fixing relates to the second and third of these competitions, between March and April 2008 and October and November 2008. Thwaites, counsel for Modi, told the court that Cairns received two cash payments of $100,000 into his Dubai bank account shortly before the third edition of the ICL in late 2008. Cairns denied any imputation of wrongdoing, saying: \"You [Thwaites] are deeming it as the first payment before a major tournament \u2026 I am deeming it as the first instalment of future occupation.\" The all-rounder, who retired from Test cricket in 2004 after winning 62 caps, was suspended from the ICL in October 2008 along with his Candigarh Lions team-mate, Dinesh Mongia. Rumours of alleged match fixing circulated in the Indian media following the suspensions, the court was told. Asked by Thwaites why Cairns did not ask the ICL to state in his notice of dismissal that he was not suspected of cricket corruption, the player said he took legal advice and \"the tactic was not to inflame the situation\". Cairns said he asked his London-based lawyer to \"shut down\" the rumours. \"I said to him, fix it. Sort it out. Shut it down.\" Cairns denies any involvement in match fixing. Modi watched Tuesday's proceedings from the back of the court. He was suspended from his role as IPL commissioner in April 2010 over separate claims. The hearing continues.",

      "bodyText": "There is an assumption that Bashar al-Assad's military solution to the current crisis in Syria is hopeless \u2013 that no matter how many centres of resistance like Baba Amr he brutally crushes, the opposition won't be quelled and the fall of his regime, whether it takes months or years, is inevitable. Yet there are recent examples where Arab governments have repressed uprisings and won. With the exception of Libya, when rebels toppled the incumbent regime only with the aid of Nato support, almost all insurgencies have ended in failure. Assad already has one template to follow: his father's crushing of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1976-82. Other successful violent strategies in the region, such as Saddam Hussein's suppression of the Iraqi Shia rebellion in 1991 and the Algerian government's victory in the civil war of 1991-2000, may also persuade the regime it can hold on. Are the conditions that allowed those regimes to survive different enough from contemporary Syria to give the opposition hope, or would Assad be right to believe that history is on his side? The strength of the security forces compared with a weak opposition is one reason why embattled regimes favour the military option. For a long time the demonstrators in Syria resembled the Shia uprising against Saddam in 1991: a spontaneous, uncoordinated rebellion against the regime. The Iraqi Shia were, in fact, in a stronger position than Syria's demonstrators today as they successfully liberated great swaths of southern Iraq for a time. In spite of this, a loyal core of Saddam's Republican Guard reconquered all lost territory within weeks, killing tens of thousands. Cultivating loyal units was a tactic utilised by Hafez Assad as well, using his brother Rifaat's Defence Companies throughout 1976-82. Today, President Bashar has regularly utilised loyal fourth armoured division troops (headed by his own brother, Maher) in Baba Amr and elsewhere \u2013 suggesting that this survival technique has been noted. Even when facing armed opposition, which the Assad regime now does, past Arab governments have overcome far greater threats than that currently posed by the Free Syrian Army (FSA). It took the Algerian government nine years and up to 200,000 deaths to overcome Islamist militia in its civil war, while it took Hafez al-Assad's regime six years and up to 60,000 deaths, but both regimes eventually held. Even with the prospect of Qatar and Saudi Arabia arming the FSA, the Syrian rebels are unlikely to reach the parity with regime forces needed for a military victory unless they persuade sizeable chunks to defect with equipment. Without major external support, as with Libya, precedent would suggest either a regime victory or at best a civil war stalemate. Importantly, in all three past cases the core of the regime held together under the pressure of an uprising. In Iraq, where Saddam faced a simultaneous rebellion from Kurds in the north, his core Sunni constituency, key members of his inner circle and the security forces all stayed loyal. The same was true in Hafez's Syria during the Muslim Brothers' uprising, particularly because of the loyalty of the Damascus merchant class. In Algeria, the military took power in a coup in 1992 and retained enough establishment support for the state to function throughout the civil war. For now, the Syrian regime also shares these traits. Its social base has shrunk but its core support, particularly members of Syria's religious minorities led by Assad's Alawi sect, has stayed loyal or neutral. The military has not splintered, with conscripts rather than officers or whole units defecting, and the merchant and middle classes of Aleppo and Damascus have remained quiet. Unlike Gaddafi's Libya, which disintegrated very quickly, the Ba'athist state continues to function. Assad may, therefore, equate his regime with those of Algeria, Iraq and his father's that survived an uprising. However, key differences may yet undo Assad. For one, the international and regional community are more mobilised against Assad than they were against either the Algerian government or that of Assad's father. In the past, too, tight control on the press ensured only piecemeal media coverage, unlike the constant stream of brutal YouTube footage outraging international public opinion today. At present, the regime seems to believe that such pressure can be weathered, perhaps hoping that the international community will repeat the climbdown that was seen in Iraq in 1991: calling for an uprising against Saddam but limiting action to a no-fly zone over Iraqi Kurdistan and economic sanctions that hurt the people more than the regime. However, both the global and regional stance may change if the slaughter continues, confronting the regime with either direct military intervention or a concerted attempt to arm the rebels. The second question is whether Assad can continue to keep a critical mass of public opinion on his side or, at least, not actively against him. The Algerian government and Hafez both faced a credible Islamist threat, whose atrocities rallied support for the regime. Contrary to regime propaganda, the majority of FSA fighters are not Islamists, and atrocities are being committed by the regime rather than the opposition. Even if the regime's minority core stays loyal, fearing retribution and a loss of privilege, will the silent majority of Syrians, particularly in central Damascus and Aleppo, accept many more Baba Amrs? The more the regime kill, the more they risk affecting extended families in other cities, widening the opposition. Recent demonstrations in the previously loyal middle-class district of Mezze in Damascus suggest the tide of public support may yet turn, particularly if the economy continues to decline under the weight of sanctions and unrest. For now, however, as with Algeria, Iraq and his father before him, the pillars of Bashar's regime remain in place. Recent historical examples in the region illustrate how difficult it is to unseat a ruling regime without the assistance of western firepower. In its absence, those seeking to topple Assad must thus consider how best to erode those pillars in a manner least damaging to Syria in the long run. For those wondering about Assad's next move, however, policymakers could do worse than look at the past Algerian, Iraqi and Syrian examples for a dictator's handbook on how to survive an uprising. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "Brazil has claimed the UK's spot as the world's sixth largest economy after official figures showed its economy rose 2.7% last year against the UK's 0.8%. France remains in fifth place behind Germany, Japan, China and the US. The per capita income of Brazilians remains less than a third of that enjoyed in the UK at $11,000 (\u00a37,000) per head, but the situation is improving all the time while western economies largely stagnate. The economic thinktank, the CEBR, predicted last year that Brazil would climb above the UK in 2012 and would itself be leapfrogged by India and Russia by 2020. Tim Ohlenburg, of the CEBR, said the high value of Brazil's currency was a big factor in the country's burgeoning wealth. \"It is a bigger economy when measured at current market exchange rates,\" he said. Brazil's dash for growth can be traced back to the mid 1990s when a string of privatisations ended the state's dominance of commercial life. China became a big customer, with a particular liking for soya beans and iron ore. The US also began to invest heavily in the country. Top of the list of economic attractions is agriculture and the processing of foodstuffs, which account for about a quarter of Brazilian GDP and 36% of exports. In the last 20 years it has become the world's largest producer of sugarcane, coffee, tropical fruits, and has the world's largest commercial cattle herd (50% larger than that of the US) at 170m animals, according to official figures. Oil is expected to become the next big commodity for export, especially if a way can be found to drill safely in the Atlantic's deep waters. Reserves are believed to equal those shared by Norway and the UK in the North Sea. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva brought in social policies to raise the incomes of Brazil's poorest after his election in 2002. Dilma Rousseff, his handpicked Workers' party successor, oversees a country where most people are considered middle class. Rousseff is considered a strong advocate for transparency in government, which is code for tackling corruption. Within the first year of her government, several cabinet ministers resigned after accusations of graft in awarding contracts. Yet bribery and the politicisation of the civil service continue to cause problems, with many overseas companies complaining that contracts are only signed and completed after dollars have greased many palms. Lula gave workers the right to sit on pension boards as a way for the low paid to exercise control over the country's growing commercial and industrial businesses. But the project has failed to realise much in the way of action and despite further labour protections, a small group of wealthy families own most of Brazil's major banks and companies. Still, the combination of huge natural resources and significant growth in manufacturing and services has meant Brazil is one of the most attractive places for the world's super rich, and that includes corporations, to park their money. One of the knock-on effects has been to push up the value of the real, which has appreciated 40% since the financial crisis of 2008. For Brazil's wealthy it is a boon because it increases their wealth and foreign buying power. It has also allowed the government to embark on a spending spree. But for exporters it is a huge headache. The long-serving finance minister, Guido Mantega, has railed against the rising value of the currency, which he knows pushes up the price of exports and could put whole industries out of business. Should the commodity boom end, the high value of the real could mean the country has little in the way of business to fall back on. Mantega blames the US, UK and continental Europe for driving investors towards Brazil. He argues that quantitative easing schemes have cheapened the world's major currencies, leaving his as one of the few attractive ones around. However, he is trapped because domestic savings are not sufficient to sustain long-term high growth rates. That means Brazil must continue to attract foreign investment, especially as the government plans to cover the cost of oil extraction, nuclear power, and other infrastructure sectors over the next few years. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2012. The original sub-heading said that figures show Brazilian economy rose 2.7% last year compared with the UK's 0.8% \u2013 but per capita income remains a third less. This has been corrected. In addition, the text stated that President Lula was elected in 2001. This has also been corrected.",

China became a big customer, with a particular liking for soya beans and iron ore. The US also began to invest heavily in the country.</p> <p>Top of the list of economic attractions is agriculture and the processing of foodstuffs, which account for about a quarter of Brazilian GDP and 36% of exports. In the last 20 years it has become the world's largest producer of sugarcane, coffee, tropical fruits, and has the world's largest commercial cattle herd (50% larger than that of the US) at 170m animals, according to official figures.</p> <p>Oil is expected to become the next big commodity for export, especially if a way can be found to drill safely in the Atlantic's deep waters. Reserves are believed to equal those shared by Norway and the UK in the North Sea.</p> <p>President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva brought in social policies to raise the incomes of Brazil's poorest after his election in 2002. Dilma Rousseff, his handpicked Workers' party successor, oversees a country where most people are considered middle class.</p> <p>Rousseff is considered a strong advocate for transparency in government, which is code for tackling corruption. Within the first year of her government, several cabinet ministers resigned after accusations of graft in awarding contracts.</p> <p>Yet bribery and the politicisation of the civil service continue to cause problems, with many overseas companies complaining that contracts are only signed and completed after dollars have greased many palms.</p> <p>Lula gave workers the right to sit on pension boards as a way for the low paid to exercise control over the country's growing commercial and industrial businesses. But the project has failed to realise much in the way of action and despite further labour protections, a small group of wealthy families own most of Brazil's major banks and companies.</p> <p>Still, the combination of huge natural resources and significant growth in manufacturing and services has meant Brazil is one of the most attractive places for the world's super rich, and that includes corporations, to park their money.</p> <p>One of the knock-on effects has been to push up the value of the real, which has appreciated 40% since the financial crisis of 2008.</p> <p>For Brazil's wealthy it is a boon because it increases their wealth and foreign buying power. It has also allowed the government to embark on a spending spree.</p> <p>But for exporters it is a huge headache. The long-serving finance minister, Guido Mantega, has railed against the rising value of the currency, which he knows pushes up the price of exports and could put whole industries out of business. Should the commodity boom end, the high value of the real could mean the country has little in the way of business to fall back on.</p> <p>Mantega blames the US, UK and continental Europe for driving investors towards Brazil. He argues that quantitative easing schemes have cheapened the world's major currencies, leaving his as one of the few attractive ones around.</p> <p>However, he is trapped because domestic savings are not sufficient to sustain long-term high growth rates. That means Brazil must continue to attract foreign investment, especially as the government plans to cover the cost of oil extraction, nuclear power, and other infrastructure sectors over the next few years.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2012. The original sub-heading said that figures show Brazilian economy rose 2.7% last year compared with the UK's 0.8% \u2013 but per capita income remains a third less. This has been corrected. In addition, the text stated that President Lula was elected in 2001. This has also been corrected.</p>",

In a research paper Mehran Nejati et al, question to what extent universities behave like large corporations and demonstrate responsibility for stakeholders and society as a whole. The authors identify seven strands that make up CSR (including organisational governance, student issues, community involvement and the environment) and conclude that developing strategies around all of these can help universities create an understanding of their role in their communities and help them manage potential conflict. While CSR is in part about building positive relationships, business consultant Richard Goossen also suggests that CSR can help an institution develop a competitive advantage and stand out from its competitors. He says: \"Universities realise that it is a competitive market in terms of creating an ongoing stream of satisfied alumni, attracting new students and addressing the concerns of business supporters, a strategy which incorporates CSR is a start.\" So how should universities be satisfying they diverse stakeholders?

Nigel Parkin, 56, allegedly befriended both girls and warned them they would not be believed if they told anyone what he had done. Married Parkin, from Somerset, is accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting and raping one girl, from the age of nine until she was 16. He allegedly indecently assaulted a second girl on two occasions when she was aged between 11 and 13. Taunton crown court heard that neither of the girls had told anyone about the alleged abuse at the time. Police were only alerted when the younger girl, now aged 19, confided in her headteacher in August 2010. Parkin, a former organist at St Andrews' church in Wiveliscombe, Somerset, and an ex-presenter on the community radio station 10Radio, denies eight charges of rape, five of indecent assault and four of sexual assault alleged to have been committed between August 1998 and October 2009. The prosecutor Sarah Regan told the jury that the alleged offences were said to have taken place in Parkin's car and at his house. Regan told jurors the younger girl was the first to come forward to say she had been sexually abused. \"She didn't tell anyone until she was 17, and that was in the school holidays in August 2010,\" Regan said. \"The reason she told her headmaster was that she knew things in her life would not get better if she kept the abuse to herself.\" Regan said Parkin was alleged to have indecently assaulted the older girl for the first time when he gave her a piano lesson when she was 11. A second incident is said to have happened when the girl was aged 12 or 13 and, she alleged, Parkin again indecently assaulted her. The girl, who is now 24, did not tell anyone of the alleged abuse until she confided in a university tutor. \"It was in that way gradually what had happened to her over the years at the hands of Nigel Parkin came out,\" Regan said. The prosecutor told the court that Parkin, of Wiveliscombe, denied all the allegations, accused the two girls of lying and said they were both suffering from mental health problems.

      "bodyText": "The gradual development of tidal generating power, which has the advantage of generating less controversy than wind turbines, has taken another step forward in the Humber estuary. A floating turbine platform is being commissioned this week which will supply electricity to The Deep in Hull, the dramatic, jaggedly-shaped aquarium which is very definitely worth a day out. The yellow Neptune Proteus device is moored 60 metres offshore with buoyancy tanks sustaining fascinating gadgetry which is explained in detail on Neptune Renewable Energy's website. The Deep is the company's first customer and ideal as for an eye-catching demonstration of how the fledgling system works. Potentially, similar small but efficient units could be sited in areas of regular and reliable tidal streams, generating power as the water flows one way and then the other during the lunar cycle. The north is well-provided with such places, especially in estuaries; although a maritime version of the turbine controversy is easy to imagine if large numbers of them were to appear. That's for the future. Meanwhile, the Proteus will keep the lights and heating on at The Deep from April, after five years of research. Neptune hope to prove the system's merits in reliability as well as cost: 3,500 fish depend on everything going smoothly in their display tanks. Nigel Petrie, chairman of Neptune Renewable Energy, which is based in Hull and North Ferriby, says: The development of the Neptune Proteus has paved the way for the design of our production model, arrays of which will provide a dedicated supply of clean power to major industries located on the Humber estuary and other suitable British locations. Supplying power to our first customer, The Deep, presents us with a great opportunity to raise the profile of our technology and of the potential for tidal stream power generation to make a significant contribution to meeting both commercial and domestic electricity demands. In spite of the recession, the Humber remains the scene of much technological innovation and its docks, from Hull round to Immingham and Grimsby via Goole, have retained their place as the UK's largest port. The combination of suitable tide and seabed conditions with potential customers onshore add to its appeal as a testbed for maritime renewable energy, which could, at the most optimistic estimates, provide 20 percent of current UK electricity needs. The secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, will be in Hull on Friday to launch the Humber local economic partnership's new forum, and tour the regeneration of Alexandra dock into the new Green Port Hull, which Siemens has chosen as the base for offshore wind turbine development. Let's hope his hosts point out the Proteus to him. He could have one just off Whitehall in the Thames.",

      "body": "<p>The gradual development of tidal generating power, which has the advantage of generating less controversy than wind turbines, has taken another step forward in the <a href=\"http://www.riverhumber.com\">Humber estuary</a>.</p> <p>A floating turbine platform is being commissioned this week which will supply electricity to <a href=\"http://www.thedeep.co.uk\">The Deep </a>in Hull, the dramatic, jaggedly-shaped aquarium which is very definitely worth a day out.</p> <p>The yellow <a href=\"http://www.neptunerenewableenergy.org.uk/advantages-of-the-neptune-proteus/\">Neptune Proteus</a> device is moored 60 metres offshore with buoyancy tanks sustaining fascinating gadgetry which is explained in detail on <a href=\"http://www.neptunerenewableenergy.org.uk/\">Neptune Renewable Energy</a>'s website. The Deep is the company's first customer and ideal as for an eye-catching demonstration of how the fledgling system works.</p> <p>Potentially, similar small but efficient units could be sited in areas of regular and reliable tidal streams, generating power as the water flows one way and then the other during the lunar cycle. The north is well-provided with such places, especially in estuaries; although a maritime version of the turbine controversy is easy to imagine if large numbers of them were to appear.</p> <p>That's for the future. Meanwhile, the Proteus will keep the lights and heating on at The Deep from April, after five years of research. Neptune hope to prove the system's merits in reliability as well as cost: 3,500 fish depend on everything going smoothly in their display tanks.</p> <p>Nigel Petrie, chairman of Neptune Renewable Energy, which is based in Hull and North Ferriby, says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The development of the Neptune Proteus has paved the way for the design of our production model, arrays of which will provide a dedicated supply of clean power to major industries located on the Humber estuary and other suitable British locations. Supplying power to our first customer, The Deep, presents us with a great opportunity to raise the profile of our technology and of the potential for tidal stream power generation to make a significant contribution to meeting both commercial and domestic electricity demands.</p> </blockquote> <p>In spite of the recession, the Humber remains the scene of much technological innovation and its docks, from Hull round to Immingham and Grimsby via Goole, have retained their place as the UK's largest port. The combination of suitable tide and seabed conditions with potential customers onshore add to its appeal as a testbed for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/20/uk-exporter-wave-tidal-power?INTCMP=SRCH\">maritime renewable energy</a>, which could, at the most optimistic estimates, provide 20 percent of current UK electricity needs.</p> <p>The secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, will be in Hull on Friday to launch the Humber local economic partnership's new forum, and tour the regeneration of Alexandra dock into the new <a href=\"http://www.greenporthull.co.uk\">Green Port Hull</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Residents-line-Siemens-wind-turbine-factory-plans/story-14398103-detail/story.html\">Siemens</a> has chosen as the base for offshore wind turbine development.</p> <p>Let's hope his hosts point out the Proteus to him. He could have one just off Whitehall in the Thames.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week, Iran's parliament approved a new amendment to a controversial law in the civil code that allows men to have as many sexual partners as they want \u2013 all sanctioned by sharia law under the term \"temporary marriage\". Sex outside marriage is a crime in Iran punishable by 100 lashes or, in the case of adultery, potentially a sentence of death by stoning. However, a man and a woman can marry for a fixed period of time after performing specific religious rituals, in a practice called sigheh. The marriage can last for a few minutes up to several years without need to be officially registered. The man can end the sigheh almost at any time, but there is no divorce right for women in temporary marriages. The new amendment, passed on Monday by 104 MPs who were all male, requires registration in certain circumstances such as those leading to a pregnancy but still largely allows sigheh without formal registration. An opposing MP, Sattar Hedayatkhah, was quoted in the reformist newspaper Etemaad as saying: \"From tomorrow, no woman can be sure that her husband is not in a sexual relationship with another woman. Therefore, there is now no difference between here [Iran] and the west. Anyone can have a sexual relationship with someone without the need to prove that there has been a 'temporary marriage' agreement.\" Those who say sigheh does not need to be registered argue that it is a matter of privacy. Sex is indeed a private matter but the truth is that Iran does not respect people's privacy when it comes to sex. Sexual affairs outside marriage or temporary marriage are considered crimes. The sigheh law has long formalised temporary marriage in favour of men, giving them right to have sex with women for as long as they wish with law on their side. The new amendments do little to recognise women's rights and let the old law continue to get away with discrimination against women, threatening the foundations of family in Iran.",

She added that the green paper which the government will publish by the end of the year setting out the scope for the act needs to examine ways of curbing Murdoch's power. \"The accumulation of too much power led to a sense of invincibility and impunity,\" Harman said, speaking at a Westminster Media Forum event about the upcoming communications legislation in Whitehall on Tuesday. \"Murdoch owns too many newspapers and had it not been for the phone-hacking scandal the government would have waved through his bid to take control of the whole of BSkyB.

You were too close weren't you?',\" she told delegates. \"When we were in government, it was the case that many senior figures did become too close to News International and Murdoch.\" However, Harman said this was a direct result of the mauling the Labour party received during the 1992 general election, which damaged its performance at the polls. \"The answer to that lies in what happened before 1992.

      "bodyText": "Rahul Gandhi, the crown prince of Indian politics, suffered a serious setback to his ambitions after voters handed the Congress party a string of defeats in crucial state elections. In five state polls, Congress secured a victory only in the politically insignificant north-eastern state of Manipur, while in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, the party trailed in fourth place. Gandhi, who had staked his political future on reviving his party's fortunes in the northern state, was not the only loser: Mayawati, the tough female chief minister from the \"untouchable\" Dalit caste, also suffered a humiliating defeat. Mayawati's party had been at the centre of a string of corruption scandals, while her administration had drawn criticism for spending lavishly on public parks with giant statues of herself and other party leaders. Congress initially sought to deflect the blame from Gandhi, but he later appeared outside his mother Sonia's Delhi home to accept his part in the defeat. \"I accept responsibility for the fact that we did not perform well. After all, I was the main campaigner \u2026 the Congress party fought well, but the result is not good,\" the 41-year-old said. There was little doubt that the result in Uttar Pradesh, where Rahul had staked his personal prestige and unleashed an aggressive campaign in a bid to revive the party, was a major blow for the young leader. The state has historical significance for the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty. During the past hundred years, six generations from the family have fought and won elections in Uttar Pradesh, with three of them ruling India as prime minister, including Rahul's father, Rajiv Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi was being touted as the fourth if the Congress party, currently in power in Delhi, were to win the next parliamentary poll due in 2014. A good performance in Uttar Pradesh would have clinched the issue for him. The winner in Uttar Pradesh was the regional socialist Samajwadi party led by a father-son duo. The media often contrasted the low-key style of the son, Akhilesh Yadav, who has a master's degree in environmental engineering from Sydney, with Gandhi's combative posturing. During the final phase of the campaign, Gandhi publicly tore up a list of promises made to the voters by Yadav, saying they were worth nothing. \"But unlike Rahul, Yadav inspired greater confidence and trust amongst upper-caste voters who wanted to get rid of Mayawati,\" said the political analyst Smita Gupta. Analysts have now begun to predict that the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty will have to wait longer than 2014 for its next prime minister. \"I am going to stick my neck out and say that Rahul Gandhi will opt out of the prime ministerial race now,\" said NDTV's Barkha Dutt. Uttar Pradesh was not the only worry for the Congress. The party suffered shock defeats in both Punjab and Goa, while it was deadlocked with its main national rival, the BJP, in the hill state of Uttarakhand. Besides Gandhi's future, the big question now is how these election results will impact on the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and his Congress-led coalition government, which has been widely criticised for poor governance and corruption, and for its failure to push ahead with much-delayed economic reforms. Much will depend now on the attitude of the Samajwadi party, the winner in Uttar Pradesh, which supports the government at the centre. Paradoxically, after the setback to Gandhi, Singh may find he has more room to execute policies that improve his administration and revive India's sagging economic growth. \"Singh's opponents in both the government and the party will now stop demanding constantly that Rahul replace him as prime minister,\" said Gupta. \"This will strengthen the prime minister's hand.\"",

Mayawati's party had been at the centre of a string of corruption scandals, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/mayawati-profile-uttar-pradesh-chief-minister\" title=\"\">while her administration had drawn criticism for spending lavishly on public parks with giant statues of herself</a> and other party leaders.</p> <p>Congress initially sought to deflect the blame from Gandhi, but he later appeared outside his mother Sonia's Delhi home to accept his part in the defeat.</p> <p>\"I accept responsibility for the fact that we did not perform well. After all, I was the main campaigner \u2026 the Congress party fought well, but the result is not good,\" the 41-year-old said.</p> <p>There was little doubt that the result in Uttar Pradesh, where Rahul had staked his personal prestige and unleashed an aggressive campaign in a bid to revive the party, was a major blow for the young leader.</p> <p>The state has historical significance for the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty. During the past hundred years, six generations from the family have fought and won elections in Uttar Pradesh, with three of them ruling India as prime minister, including Rahul's father, Rajiv Gandhi.</p> <p>Rahul Gandhi was being touted as the fourth if the Congress party, currently in power in Delhi, were to win the next parliamentary poll due in 2014. A good performance in Uttar Pradesh would have clinched the issue for him.</p> <p>The winner in Uttar Pradesh was the regional socialist Samajwadi party led by a father-son duo. The media often contrasted the low-key style of the son, Akhilesh Yadav, who has a master's degree in environmental engineering from Sydney, with Gandhi's combative posturing.</p> <p>During the final phase of the campaign, Gandhi publicly tore up a list of promises made to the voters by Yadav, saying they were worth nothing.</p> <p>\"But unlike Rahul, Yadav inspired greater confidence and trust amongst upper-caste voters who wanted to get rid of Mayawati,\" said the political analyst Smita Gupta.</p> <p>Analysts have now begun to predict that the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty will have to wait longer than 2014 for its next prime minister. \"I am going to stick my neck out and say that Rahul Gandhi will opt out of the prime ministerial race now,\" said NDTV's Barkha Dutt.</p> <p>Uttar Pradesh was not the only worry for the Congress. The party suffered shock defeats in both Punjab and Goa, while it was deadlocked with its main national rival, the BJP, in the hill state of Uttarakhand.</p> <p>Besides Gandhi's future, the big question now is how these election results will impact on the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and his Congress-led coalition government, which has been widely criticised for poor governance and corruption, and for its failure to push ahead with much-delayed economic reforms. Much will depend now on the attitude of the Samajwadi party, the winner in Uttar Pradesh, which supports the government at the centre.</p> <p>Paradoxically, after the setback to Gandhi, Singh may find he has more room to execute policies that improve his administration and revive India's sagging economic growth.</p> <p>\"Singh's opponents in both the government and the party will now stop demanding constantly that Rahul replace him as prime minister,\" said Gupta. \"This will strengthen the prime minister's hand.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "What is a slut? What does Rush Limbaugh mean when he says \"slut\"? Do we see each other as sexual archetypes and vote accordingly? \"Anybody who has several sexual partners in a year is committing spiritual suicide,\" David Brooks wrote a few years ago in one of his Times op-ed columns, in about as forthright a declaration of conservative sexual revulsion as you're likely to get. \"He or she is ripping the veil from all that is private and delicate in oneself, and pulverizing it in an assembly line of selfish sensations.\" In other words, in the conservative world, sluttiness is binary: you are or you aren't. Although Brooks is correct enough to include men here \u2013 \"he or she\" \u2013 it is probably truer that he mostly means women. His formulation is about fragility and weakness (pulverized) and veils. It's the ladies who are most at risk from sluttiness. Brooks, along with Charles Murray, and more recently joined by Rick Santorum, apply a disapproving sociology to show that sexual permissiveness has not only a vast negative moral dimension, but is harmful to the commonweal: people who have a lot of sex are a problem demographic. Rick Santorum's position on sex and how it should be confined is strictly Catholic in an old-time sense. It seems to have surprised just about everybody that he's been able to bring it back with such gusto \u2013 he's made birth control an issue! He cannot be \"born-again\" because Catholics don't go in for that, but he certainly has a born-again zeal and a convert's militancy (rightwing fundamentalists are not classically partial to Catholics, but he seems to have captured an impressive number of diehard protestant hearts). The New York Times ran a curious recent profile of Santorum pointing out that his wife, Karen, had had a long-time relationship with an older man, to whom she wasn't married, who was, to boot, a well-known abortionist. Whatever happened between her and her former boyfriend, and later, her and Rick, seems to have drawn a battle line between her former life and their current one. They both seem to have been fortified by rejecting and now demonizing a certain behavior, and returning to the most rigid and proscribed Catholicism. She repented. Rush Limbaugh is the opposite of Brooks and Santorum, both who seem quite non-sexual. Whereas Rush seems debauched: sated, flabby, flushed. He and Newt Gingrich are in this other conservative mold: they are the bad boys (a different category from bad girls). There are, of course, their many wives and, for Rush, the pills. Rush, we know, has a life full of excess and indulgence \u2013 and perhaps, though it is not that easy to imagine, sensual pleasure. In his attack on birth control advocate, Sandra Fluke, Rush hooked the word \"slut\" to the word \"prostitute\". I suppose, historically, in a Dickensian sort of world, being the former could lead, or was thought to lead, to the latter. But now, they're two vastly different categories of sexual activity. But obviously not to Rush. It is, I think, reasonable to trust what Rush says. All his utterance seem spontaneous and from some horrifying but genuine core. This is, undoubtedly, why he is so popular: he's unfiltered. It's an electrifying id. In other words, he probably does think that women who have a lot of sex, or perhaps anything more than a minimal amount, are \"whores\". And whores, in this usage, seem to have sex not just for money, but for deranged, subversive, and anarchic reasons. This is an old-time view that has mostly been badgered out of liberal men, but that the conservatives have somehow been able to forthrightly hold onto: good girls and bad girls. Karen Santorum going from bad to good seems to be among Rick Santorum's proudest accomplishments. Rush, we might imagine, has spent more time with bad girls than with good girls and, indeed, might well bear a grudge against the women who have, in his eyes, led him astray. The point has been crystallized by Limbaugh and the Republican field: the sexual world is a terrible threat. But the reverse is also true: if conservatives see a liberal world of extreme sexual goings-on, liberals look back with awe and mockery, too. Santorum, let's face it, seems sexually puzzling. He would likely make a sexually active nation quite uncomfortable. (Likewise, David Brooks, on his part, has always seemed to me, in his Sunday morning show appearances, to be an odd, furtive, hidden, quite alarming figure.) Mitt Romney has benefited from the Santorum contrast. But in a general election, I think Mitt's sexual basis will be judged more critically. The plastic issue will be have to be overcome. The sense that a candidate is having sex is a much more powerful and positive attribute than the sense that he is not. (Bill Clinton, most obviously.) That is, actually, the corner the Republicans have gotten themselves into now. For some time, the conservative subtext has been to suggest that the liberals were less flesh-and-blood than the visceral Republicans. One was fey, the other strong. One snobbish and remote, the other popular and direct. The message here was simple: Republican men are men. The present field of Republican men, together with Rush's anger at liberals for having sex, recasts these roles. The liberals, after a long time in the wilderness, are emerging as the much more sexy bunch.",

      "bodyText": "NOW THE TEACHER IS AWAY, ALL THE KIDS BEGIN TO PLAY Considering some members of the fawning English press pack are so enraptured by 'Arry Redknapp they saw nothing untoward about serenading him Marilyn Monroe-style with a rendition of 'Appy Birthday at a recent press conference, it was only going to be a matter of time before the Tottenham and future England manager was linked with the vacant manager's job at Chelsea. So it came as no great surprise this morning when 'Arry was quoted coyly denying having any interest in one of world football's most lucrative gigs. \"It would be difficult. I wouldn't be able to come back to north London,\" guffawed the man who is so loyal he once took a sabbatical from Portsmouth to relegate Southampton and then go back again. \"So no, I will pass on this one,\" he added, no doubt in a bid to appease his nephew Frank Lampard, who \u2013 poor results aside \u2013 seems to have been doing a perfectly adequate job co-managing Chelsea for some months now. Of course, seeing as the club's Russian owner Roman Abramovich is famously as thick and difficult to read as a copy of James Joyce's Ulysses, football hacks have been forced to speculate feverishly and almost exclusively without foundation about who might succeed Andre Villas-Boas beyond the obvious handful of usual suspects. And considering he once worked with Jose Mourinho, manages a team that plays attractive passing football and has done more to advance the careers of promising Chelsea youngsters in recent months than any actual Chelsea managers in recent memory, it's small wonder Swansea City boss Brendan Rodgers' name has cropped up in dispatches. \"If any of our fans are wondering about me and Chelsea, they need not panic. I am trying to build my career and not destroy it,\" said the Norn Irish manager, who either genuinely doesn't want the job or is cleverly forcing his way on to Abramovich's radar by deliberately playing hard to get. Other men linked with the Chelsea job today? Rafa Benitez (\"As a manager with experience in [Big Cup], in Spain and in Italy, I am open to offers\"), Germany manager Jogi Low (\"I see no reason for me to comment on media speculation\") and Glenn Hoddle (blah blah blah \"unfinished business\" situation). With just three months of this drivel to go, tune in to tomorrow's Fiver, when we fully expect Micky Adams, John Gregory and Dvd O'Lry to have thrown/withdrawn their titfers into/from the ring. \u2022 Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm for live MBM coverage of Birmingham 1-2 Chelsea in the FA Cup fifth round replay. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"This was a private bit of banter released to the social media and for some reason the press etc tore us apart \u2026 For 17 years, my life was a dressing room and everyone who's been in a dressing room knows what kind of banter goes on. It's a place where you can get ripped apart at times by your fellow players. We had that type of dressing room at Sky where we wanted people to feel comfortable and we had conversations about many things. In 20 years in studios up and down the country I've heard people saying things off camera that would make your hair curl. I do not see myself as $exist. Not in a million years. I have four daughters and I was brought up by a wonderful mother on her own\" - former Sky Sports presenter Andy Gray tells Lahn's Lahn E'n'n Stannah about his sacking last year, and also admits that he considered taking his own life: \"I would be lying if I said I didn't.\" ALL THIS USELESS BEAUTY When a young boy falls off his bike, the caring parent urges him to get straight back on so that, before fear embeds itself, he realises that he really can do this cycling thing. But what about when a young boy falls off his bike because his bike is made of paper and came from a Christmas cracker and the pedals are broken and the saddle is soiled with stains of a suspicious nature?

Wenger himself persisted with similarly strange reversals of logic, explaining that it is Milan, who breezed to victory in Italy, whose heads must be all askew. \"Sometimes when you have made a big score, the difficulty is always psychological,\" jabbered Wenger, tossing in a \"sometimes/always\" clash to confuse matters further. \"When you have a big lead, you think you just need to turn up and defend well,\" elaborated the man oddly voted manager of the month for February, as if turning up and defending well is not all that Milan have to do tonight. Following on from such logic, we might say that Arsenal's cause is helped by the fact that they are without several midfielders tonight, including Mikel Arteta. Arsenal's cause may be helped. \"Basically I have only two midfielders, with [Alex] Song and [Tomas] Rosicky, so that means we have to play with four strikers,\" blathered Wenger.

I wouldn't be able to come back to north London,\" guffawed the man who is so loyal he once took a sabbatical from Portsmouth to relegate Southampton and then go back again. \"So no, I will pass on this one,\" he added, no doubt in a bid to appease his nephew Frank Lampard, who \u2013 poor results aside \u2013 seems to have been doing a perfectly adequate job co-managing Chelsea for some months now.</p> <p>Of course, seeing as the club's Russian owner Roman Abramovich is famously as thick and difficult to read as a copy of James Joyce's Ulysses, football hacks have been forced to speculate feverishly and almost exclusively without foundation about who might succeed Andre Villas-Boas beyond the obvious handful of usual suspects. And considering he once worked with Jose Mourinho, manages a team that plays attractive passing football and has done more to advance the careers of promising Chelsea youngsters in recent months than any actual Chelsea managers in recent memory, it's small wonder Swansea City boss Brendan Rodgers' name has cropped up in dispatches.</p> <p>\"If any of our fans are wondering about me and Chelsea, they need not panic. I am trying to build my career and not destroy it,\" said the Norn Irish manager, who either genuinely doesn't want the job or is cleverly forcing his way on to Abramovich's radar by deliberately playing hard to get. Other men linked with the Chelsea job today? Rafa Benitez (\"As a manager with experience in [Big Cup], in Spain and in Italy, I am open to offers\"), Germany manager Jogi Low (\"I see no reason for me to comment on media speculation\") and Glenn Hoddle (blah blah blah \"unfinished business\" situation). With just three months of this drivel to go, tune in to tomorrow's Fiver, when we fully expect Micky Adams, John Gregory and Dvd O'Lry to have thrown/withdrawn their titfers into/from the ring.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\"><em>Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm for live MBM coverage of Birmingham 1-2 Chelsea in the FA Cup fifth round replay</em></a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"This was a private bit of banter released to the social media and for some reason the press etc tore us apart \u2026 For 17 years, my life was a dressing room and everyone who's been in a dressing room knows what kind of banter goes on. It's a place where you can get ripped apart at times by your fellow players. We had that type of dressing room at Sky where we wanted people to feel comfortable and we had conversations about many things. In 20 years in studios up and down the country I've heard people saying things off camera that would make your hair curl. I do not see myself as $exist. Not in a million years. I have four daughters and I was brought up by a wonderful mother on her own\" - former Sky Sports presenter Andy Gray tells Lahn's Lahn E'n'n Stannah about his sacking last year, and also admits that he considered taking his own life: \"I would be lying if I said I didn't.\"</p> <h2>ALL THIS USELESS BEAUTY</h2> <p>When a young boy falls off his bike, the caring parent urges him to get straight back on so that, before fear embeds itself, he realises that he really can do this cycling thing.

BBC director of policy and strategy, John Tate, said CBeebies, the BBC's pre-school service, is now 13th on the EPG list of children's channels on Sky, with CBBC in 14th. Above it are channels such as Nicktoons, Boomerang and six Disney services. Speaking at a Westminster Media Forum seminar about the upcoming communications green paper in Whitehall on Tuesday, Tate claimed the current situation was \"counter intuitive\" and \"wrong for the British public\". \"The work that goes into our channels could not be larger in terms of UK-originated content,\" he added. He said the BBC was worried about a situation where \"due prominence is not respected\". Speaking at the event after his session Tate said the current situation was \"ridiculous\" and called on the government to look at tightening up the definition of due prominence. \"When you look at the channels above CBBC and CBeebies then you realise they don't have the earthy UK material we do,\" he said. \"Sky crows about its commitment to UK content so it should be doing something about this. We need a new framework for due prominence and Sky needs to show goodwill and some common sense.\" Tate's comments were refuted by Sky's director of policy and public affairs, David Wheeldon, who said at the event the existing regulatory model built around a public service broadcaster such as the BBC was \"out of date\" because it failed to properly recognise the contribution of commercial companies. \"We follow a very rational EPG policy at Sky which is very heavily regulated,\" he said. \"CBeebies has a higher share on Sky where it's not at the tip of the EPG than it does on Virgin [Media] where it is at the top of the EPG,\" Wheeldon added. Sky is obligated to provide \"due prominence\" to public service channels on the EPG according to a code of practice policed by Ofcom. However, the broadcaster does have some discretion and Ofcom does not currently have the power to prescribe positioning on the EPG. The broadcasting minister, Ed Vaizey, has suggested this could change. In January he told the Oxford Media Convention that the 2015 broadcasting green paper will suggest that broadcasters are rewarded with a higher slot on EPGs if they commit to transmitting more public-service programmes such as news and children's shows. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

As widely expected, the Spaniard Alejandro Valverde won the uphill sprint, scooping up a 10-second time bonus that lifted him up the standings to 20sec behind the Briton. Before his ban for doping the Spaniard was virtually unbeatable in this type of finish. There are at least four more stages where he has a chance of winning, so he will have plenty of opportunity to claw back more seconds. \"It was really hard today,\" said Wiggins, the Team Sky leader. \"Everybody was knackered.\" After Monday's unexpectedly tough stage to Orleans, Tuesday was more routine, a three-man escape given enough latitude to inspire faint hope they might last to the finish but kept sufficiently within reach to be scooped up in the final kilometres. Wiggins's Team Sky kept the peloton rolling along until the road began to rise to the finish, at which point Valverde's Movistar \u2013 managed by the same group of directors who ran the legendary Banesto team of Miguel Indurain \u2013 took over. In the sprint the Spaniard did well to hold off the fast-finishing Australian Simon Gerrans, one of Wiggins's team mates at Sky until this year, when he moved to the new Australian set-up GreenEDGE, who, like Sky, have close links to the national team. It was straightforward stuff but Valverde's is a contorted story, like that of his fellow Spaniard Alberto Contador. Valverde spent almost four years as one of the best specialists at hilly one-day races and short stage races, all the while denying any links with the blood doping ring Operaci\u00f3n Puerto, unmasked in 2006. One of the blood bags was labelled Piti, apparently the name of his dog; another Valv. Eventually a connection was established through DNA testing and after a lengthy appeal process he was banned in 2010. He returned at the start of this year, hungry for success, although redemption will be harder to find. Wednesday's stage looks anything but simple on paper, with two second category and four third category climbs in the 111 miles through the Cantal and Aveyron, with another uphill finish in the town of Rodez. It is not massively steep but the ascent lasts 2.5km, with a third category prime 1.5km from the line. It will suit Valverde, who will again be looking to shave at least 10sec from his deficit. To avoid that happening, Sky may well let an escape have its head, in the hope that some of its number get to the finish to scoop up the time bonuses. That in turn, could force the Spaniard and his team to show their hand.",

Wiggins's Team Sky kept the peloton rolling along until the road began to rise to the finish, at which point Valverde's Movistar \u2013 managed by the same group of directors who ran the legendary Banesto team of Miguel Indurain \u2013 took over. In the sprint the Spaniard did well to hold off the fast-finishing Australian Simon Gerrans, one of Wiggins's team mates at Sky until this year, when he moved to the new Australian set-up GreenEDGE, who, like Sky, have close links to the national team. It was straightforward stuff but Valverde's is a contorted story, like that of his fellow Spaniard Alberto Contador.</p> <p>Valverde spent almost four years as one of the best specialists at hilly one-day races and short stage races, all the while denying any links with the blood doping ring Operaci\u00f3n Puerto, unmasked in 2006. One of the blood bags was labelled Piti, apparently the name of his dog; another Valv. Eventually a connection was established through DNA testing and after a lengthy appeal process he was banned in 2010. He returned at the start of this year, hungry for success, although redemption will be harder to find.</p> <p>Wednesday's stage looks anything but simple on paper, with two second category and four third category climbs in the 111 miles through the Cantal and Aveyron, with another uphill finish in the town of Rodez. It is not massively steep but the ascent lasts 2.5km, with a third category <em>prime</em> 1.5km from the line.</p> <p>It will suit Valverde, who will again be looking to shave at least 10sec from his deficit. To avoid that happening, Sky may well let an escape have its head, in the hope that some of its number get to the finish to scoop up the time bonuses. That in turn, could force the Spaniard and his team to show their hand.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The outpouring of genuine affection for Lewis Moody from all quarters of the game speaks volumes. Not every retiring England captain is guaranteed a standing ovation but there have been few more popular players inside or outside the dressing room since the dawn of professionalism in the mid-90s. The announcement of the 33-year-old flanker's enforced exit from the fray deprives us of a man who thought nothing of hurling his body where others feared to look, let alone tread. Not for Moody the easy crutches of self-preservation or selfishness. His former captain Martin Johnson summed up his qualities better than most. \"When I look back at playing with Lewis it always brings a smile to my face \u2013 it was never dull. He was one of the most committed guys I ever played with and had a complete disregard for his own physical wellbeing. It's sad that he has had to retire but he should be remembered for a great career and someone who never gave less than 100% for his club and country.\" A tally of 71 caps, seven Premiership titles for Leicester and two Lions Test caps do not, as Johnson hints, tell the entire story. Nor did the final, acrimonious World Cup campaign to New Zealand which ended so messily. Better, perhaps, to dwell on the annus mirabilis of 2003 when his soaring lineout take famously set up the drive from which Jonny Wilkinson kicked Australia to defeat in the World Cup final. Moody was writing a column for the Guardian at the time and, clearly, this would be a first-person piece to grace any scrapbook. I vividly remember turning up at the Manly Pacific Hotel the following lunchtime to assist Lewis with his composition. It was a triumph of optimism over bleary-eyed reality. The author, along with everyone else, had been up all night and had the tell-tale weary grin of a man struggling to recall his own name. Hunter S Thompson would have appreciated the hazy recollections printed the following day. Moody's gift, though, was to survive and thrive in a ferociously intense top-level sport for 16 years without exhibiting a shred of malice for anyone or anything. He relished the physical contact almost as much as he loved galloping off in search of it. He might as well have played with the words \"No Regrets\" tattooed across his forehead; even after a dozen operations he retained an almost child-like enthusiasm for a game which caused him no end of pain. As England captain he was decent, courteous, polite and wholly committed, without once pretending to be Mike Brearley. As a player, particularly in his early days, he was a fly-half's waking nightmare. He was also loyal to his mates, even when they retold embarrassing stories at his expense, The all-time favourite has to be his failure to pay an overdue gas bill while living in a student house in Leicester. He had opened the letter, seen the words \"Outstanding Balance\" and thought they were writing to congratulate him. There was also the time he argued Argentina was definitely in Europe, not to mention the occasion he revealed his mum had phoned to tell him to close the windows because it was raining. Genius. For all this, and more, Moody will be fondly remembered whatever he does with the rest of his life. He has also become a standard-bearer for colitis sufferers, having gone public about his lengthy struggle with the condition. Finally he can relax on a Saturday afternoon, although that may not be as easy as it sounds. \"Rugby has been my life for such a long time now, it is scary to imagine what it will be like without it,\" he confessed on Tuesday. Having played just 44 minutes of Premiership rugby for Bath this season, however, his body will certainly relish a break. In the end it was a shoulder operation following his last appearance against Worcester in November that proved the final straw for a player whose injury woes rivalled Wilkinson's. \"Sometimes it's just luck. Sometimes maybe I trained too hard, though I can't speak for Jonny. We both went through a hideous run of injuries and it does affect you on all sorts of levels,\" he told me before Christmas. \"But it's the nature of the beast. I'll look back at my career and say that I still managed to play a lot of rugby. I'll never look back and say I wish I'd tried a bit harder. I'll always know I achieved as much as I possibly could have done. That said, I don't think I appreciate yet quite how much I will miss it.\" Or, in turn, how much people will miss him.",

In fact, if you've read either of the great epics, Iliad or Odyssey, you'll notice that the poetically eloquent Homer had an unexpectedly sparse colour vocabulary. Does this mean that Homer lived in a relatively colourless world? These intriguing observations led British statesman and Homeric scholar, William Ewart Gladstone, to \"launch a thousand ships of learning\" when more than 150 years ago he proposed that the Greeks were partially colour-blind. This peculiar hypothesis has had a profound effect on the development of three academic disciplines and triggered a debate that continues to this day: Does the language you speak affect or reflect how you perceive and think about the world? This recasting of the nature/nurture debate has kept scholars engaged in verbal arm-wrestling contests to this very day, a theme that author Guy Deutscher explores at length in his book, Through the Language Glass: Why The World Looks Different In Other Languages [2011: Arrow Books; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US]. The first section of the book, entitled \"The Language Mirror\", provides an overview of the practical reasons why words for individual colors appear in a consistent order across human languages. Words for black and white appear first since night and day are the most obvious events in a human's daily life and they present the strongest contrasts. The word for red then follows, since blood is red, and this is the next most important colour as humans regularly engage in warfare, hunting, childbirth and other bloody exercises. Colour names for yellow and green emerge later in many cultures due to the influence of agriculture and the need to specifically signify ripe or unripe grains and fruits. Then finally, the word for blue typically pops up. This orderly semantic progression sets the stage for a prolonged examination of whether our mother tongue affects our colour perception. For example, if the sea is \"wine-coloured\" as Homer asserted, or if there is no word-name distinguishing green from yellow or green from blue in a particular language, can the speakers of that language perceive these colours? A separate section containing colour plates anchors this discussion, but overall, I found the shades of grey in this line of argument to be tedious and circular. Further, how the brain processes neural colour input is far more complex than Deutscher ever lets on, although he briefly revisits his colour idea at the end of the book to let us know that he probably shouldn't have discussed the colour example at all. Ho hum. The second section of the book, \"The Language Lens\", segues into an investigation of word gender (or type) in languages. Some languages do not have gender at all (e.g. the Finno-Ugric branch), whilst some are gender neutral (e.g. English), others have masculine, feminine and neuter genders (the Romance and Germanic languages) whilst still others have a plethora of additional genders, such as human/animal/canine/vegetable/drinks/liquids/mineral, etc. After introducing and attempting to explain the logic of gender assignment for particular words (an impossible task to do properly), the author then asks whether the gender of an object's name word affects how we think about those objects? Deutscher, a native Hebrew speaker, illustrates this idea using an example translated from Hebrew: Out of the masculine window I can see the masculine trees and on them the birds, which are feminine regardless of the accident of their anatomy. If I knew more about (feminine) ornithology, I could tell by looking at each bird what biological sex she was. I would point at her and explain to the less initiated: 'You can tell she is a male because of that red spot on her chest and also because she is larger than the females.' And I would not feel there was anything remotely strange about that. [p. 204] Is that so strange? This is no more strange than ships retaining their feminine gender in English until, well, the publishing industry formally neutralised that charming little holdout in previous decade or so. Deutscher goes on to discuss a number of psychological experiments designed to get at this fundamental gender/perception question. For example, native Spanish speakers are more likely perceive bridges (el puente; masculine gender) as being particularly big, strong or dangerous whilst native German speakers are more likely to perceive bridges (die Br\u00fccke; feminine gender) as elegant, fragile and slender. The second half of the book, particularly Deutscher's discussion of gender and perception, was far more interesting and compelling than his prolonged expos\u00e9 on colour, in my opinion. But it is a relief that, in the end, Deutscher concludes with what most of the rest of us already knew: neither the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (language determines one's worldview) nor the Pinker hypothesis (language has no effect on one's worldview) can fully answer this nature (brain) versus nurture (culture) debate. In short, it's a little of both. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

He is a former Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge and of the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Languages in the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.

Some languages do not have gender at all (e.g. the Finno-Ugric branch), whilst some are gender neutral (e.g. English), others have masculine, feminine and neuter genders (the Romance and Germanic languages) whilst still others have a plethora of additional genders, such as human/animal/canine/vegetable/drinks/liquids/mineral, <em>etc</em>.</p> <p>After introducing and attempting to explain the logic of gender assignment for particular words (an impossible task to do properly), the author then asks whether the gender of an object's name word affects how we think about those objects? Deutscher, a native Hebrew speaker, illustrates this idea using an example translated from Hebrew:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>Out of the masculine window I can see the masculine trees and on them the birds, which are feminine regardless of the accident of their anatomy. If I knew more about (feminine) ornithology, I could tell by looking at each bird what biological sex she was. I would point at her and explain to the less initiated: 'You can tell she is a male because of that red spot on her chest and also because she is larger than the females.' And I would not feel there was anything remotely strange about that. [p. 204]</p> </blockquote> <p>Is that so strange? This is no more strange than ships retaining their feminine gender in English until, well, the publishing industry formally neutralised that charming little holdout in previous decade or so. </p> <p>Deutscher goes on to discuss a number of psychological experiments designed to get at this fundamental gender/perception question. For example, native Spanish speakers are more likely perceive bridges (<em>el puente</em>; masculine gender) as being particularly big, strong or dangerous whilst native German speakers are more likely to perceive bridges (<em>die Br\u00fccke</em>; feminine gender) as elegant, fragile and slender.</p> <p>The second half of the book, particularly Deutscher's discussion of gender and perception, was far more interesting and compelling than his prolonged expos\u00e9 on colour, in my opinion. But it is a relief that, in the end, Deutscher concludes with what most of the rest of us already knew: neither the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (language determines one's worldview) nor the Pinker hypothesis (language has no effect on one's worldview) can fully answer this nature (brain) versus nurture (culture) debate. In short, it's a little of both. </p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guydeutscher.org/\">Guy Deutscher</a> is an Israeli linguist and an honorary Research Fellow at the <a href=\"http://www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/\">School of Languages, Linguistics and Cultures in the University of Manchester</a>.

The vacancy at Dior remains unfilled, while the designers Raf Simons and Stefano Pilati, handed their P45s under the glaring spotlight of catwalk season, have been forced to take their final bows under a crossfire of rumour and denial. Such was the backstory to the Chanel show, which brought the fashion industry to the Grand Palais on the penultimate day of Paris fashion week. Six weeks ago, designer Karl Lagerfeld turned part of this building into a plane interior, complete with an above-the-clouds view projected beyond the rows of small oval windows, for the set of his Chanel Couture show. This time, Lagerfeld transformed the domed glass building into the Fortress of Solitude, the sparkling crystalline lair of Superman. The floor was thickly covered with glinting white-grey sand. Polished matchstick slivers of amethyst and smokey quartz, tall and angular as catwalk models, were arranged in chic piles between the benches. In pride of place on the front row was Katy Perry, sporting the exact bluebottle hair shade of the cartoon Lois Lane. Was Karl Lagerfeld about to save Planet Fashion? But heroes, it seems, are rather last season; right now, fashion is all about the bad guys. This was a dark, moody Chanel collection that made no attempt to lift the brooding gloom that has engulfed the catwalk shows. Why cheer people up when brooding can be so glamorous? The breakout stars of the Chanel catwalk were the gem-encrusted eyebrows \u2013 handmade for the show by the legendary Parisian embroidery house of Lesage \u2013 that served to make the models look both fed up and spectacular. Lagerfeld appears to have decided that what a downcast fashion industry needs is not cheering up, but a way to give frowning a bling makeover. Showmanship aside, the material impact of a Chanel collection is twofold: in the silhouette it promotes, and in the accessories. The line was slim, rather than skinny, with volume in the dropped shoulders and in the geometric mouldings of knits and coats. Glitter tweed, a Chanel classic, gave a mineral glint to jackets that had sportswear styling in their half-elasticated waists and oversized hoods, while full skirts were worn over slim velvet trousers. Standout accessories included ankle-strap sandals with crystals prettily encrusted around the heel, and a new line of miniature bags in classic Chanel shapes that will ensure packed-out boutiques from Beijing to Buenos Aires. It was a celebration of the dark arts of fashion, as practised by its master. But \u2013 as if to assure the industry that not all is doom and gloom \u2013 Lagerfeld added one special ingredient to lighten the mood of the show.

So the idea of turning human waste into algae and then into biofuel is an attractive one and is now going to be put to the test on a commercial scale in southern Spain. The \u20ac12m project will see the sunny skies of Cadiz beaming down on open ponds in which algae suck up the nutrients from the waste water. If all goes to plan over the next five years, the plant will produce about three tonnes of algae a day from 10 hectares of ponds, enough to run about 200 vehicles. The project is led by Aqualia, the third largest private water company in the world, with six other technology and academic partners providing expertise. The European Commission has provided \u20ac7m of the \u20ac12m funding. Aqualia's Frank Rogalla says the project would turn the sewage treatment facility from a consumer of energy to a producer of energy, very much like the fuel-cell technology I wrote about last week. First, much of the organic matter will be anaerobically digested to produce methane, another fuel source. This is already done on in some tropical countries and for special waste waters, such as that from breweries. The reason for the pre-treatment is so the algae don't have to battle it out with bacteria for the organics. Instead, the carbon dioxide produced alongside the methane is pumped back into the waste water, to feed the algae. A key advantage of the proposal is that the waster water is already full of the nutrients - nitrogen and phosphorus - that the algae need to grow. \"We would get the nutrients for free, when today we get paid to destroy them,\" says Rogalla. He says 30% of the costs for commercial algae growers is buying in nutrients. The algae will not be specially selected strains but instead what grows naturally in the ponds. To use specialised strains would require a closed system, to avoid contamination, which would make the operation very expensive, says Rogalla. Once the algae is harvested and the oils separated to produce biofuel, the remaining organic matter will be burned to generate electricity, as Thames water in the UK are doing. So the operation will produce enough methane to power 400 vehicles (the fuel is commonly used to power buses and trucks in Spain and being tested in the UK), biodiesel for 200 other vehicles and electricity. Rogalla claims that no-one is yet producing tonnes of algae per day, and neither is Aqualia, yet. But if they can, at a reasonable cost, then they will have demonstrated where there's muck, there is indeed brass.",

Robert A Levinson vanished on Kish Island, a Persian Gulf resort, in March 2007. He was 59 at the time. Formerly an FBI agent, Levinson was working as a private investigator when he disappeared. His family and US officials say he was investigating cigarette smuggling for a private client at the time of his disappearance. In December, a video of Levinson surfaced showing him alive, if gaunt, a year earlier. Levinson addresses the camera from inside a concrete cell, where he claims to have been held for three years. He said he had been treated well, but implored US authorities to co-operate with his unidentified captors. \"I need the help of the United States government to answer the requests of the group that has held me,\" Levinson said at the time. \"Please help me get home. Thirty-three years of service to the United States deserves something,\" he added. Levinison's wife and seven children received an email last year containing photographs of him wearing what appears to be an orange prison uniform and with a full beard. While federal agents were able to trace the emails back to Afghanistan or Pakistan, they were unable to pinpoint their exact source. On Tuesday, the FBI issued a statement reading: \"The Federal Bureau of Investigation will hold a press conference to announce a reward of up to $1,000,000 for information leading directly to the safe location, recovery and return of Robert A Levinson. Robert A Levinson is a US citizen and former FBI Special Agent who disappeared from Kish Island, Iran, five years ago on March 9, 2007.\" The agency announced the reward at a press conference at the FBI's field office in Washington, DC. Officials in Iran have denied any knowledge of Levinson's disappearance. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, during a 2010 trip to the US, said his government was willing to co-operate in the investigation. Last year, the secretary of state, Hilary Clinton, indirectly referred to the case, saying the US had evidence Levinson was alive.",

The aim of the conference is to review the global treaty widely credited for creating the basis of today's connected world, thus the international regulatory framework governing all ICT technologies. The conference comes at a time when technology is having a major impact on economic and social development, and represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve it even further. The treaty under review is known as the International Telecommunication Regulations, or ITRs. It provides governments and industries across the globe with the necessary frameworks for bringing variety and competition to their telecommunications and ICT markets. Telecom regulations opened the door in the 1990s for mobile and the internet technologies. They have stood the test of time but need to adapt to the rapid technological innovations and address critical issues such as cybersecurity. Cyberthreats are on the rise and the risk of cyberwar is very real. But there are no superpowers in cyberspace. In a connected world we are as strong as our weakest link. We can only achieve global solutions through a global framework that promotes \u2013 for example \u2013 the secured sharing of information and expertise, more effective early warning systems to mitigate cyberrisks, and developing effective resilience across society. The WCIT-12, which is being convened at the request of our 193 member states, will discuss these issues. We have the depth of experience that comes from being the world's longest established intergovernmental organisation and we've been carrying ITU's essential role from the days of the telegraph right through to the modern interconnected world. The right to communicate has been central to the ITU's mission since its origins. Many feel that the time has come to build on the success of the ITR treaty and pave way for creating a fully inclusive information society over the next decade, one that ensures the world's people can gain equitable and affordable access to voice, video and data. Governments and the private sector have complementary roles. Governments shape policy and regulation in consultation with all stakeholders, and the private sector delivers services and infrastructure. Together, ultimately, they implement. WCIT will express the common will of ITU's major stakeholders \u2013 its government and private sector membership \u2013 and we'll continue to ask for input and feedback. The conference should find win-win solutions that will act as a positive catalyst for the future development of ICT, to benefit all countries and every aspect of people's social lives.

      "bodyText": "Men and women are being urged to donate any unwanted suits cluttering up their wardrobes as part of a national drive to help homeless people in the UK get back into work. A major barrier facing homeless people trying to get a job is having nothing clean or smart to wear for an interview, so suitmaker A Suit That Fits has teamed up with three homelessness charities to encourage donations. Anyone handing over a suit will be given a \u00a350 gift voucher that can be spent on bespoke tailoring at the retailer. Until 26 April suits can be donated to the Suit for Success campaign, which will then be distributed to homelessness charities Amber, Broadway and Emmaus who will pass them on to those in need. The items can be handed into individual stores, or a number of other locations listed on the website, or arrangements can be made to collect them from corporate outlets. Each of the charities involved offer work and learning outreach programmes to equip members with the skills and confidence they need to get a job and fully support themselves. But they find that members often have nothing suitable to wear to their interview which affects their confidence and can ruin that crucial first impression. By providing people with a smart, clean suit, the company wants to make the process easier. There is little financial help for those needing a hand to buy clothing or pay for travel costs from either government or other sources. In April 2011 several pots of government funding were replaced by the Department of Work and Pensions with the Flexible Support Fund (FSF) \u2013 a fund which gives Jobcentre Plus Districts greater freedom to tailor back-to-work support to individual and local need, giving Jobcentre Plus advisers and managers discretion to decide how to help individuals. There is no exhaustive list of needs that may be met by the FSF, but examples could include travel costs, tools or training and even clothing for interviews or specialist items required once work is obtained, such as heavy-duty boots for construction workers. The new fund is estimated to be worth about \u00a3147m nationally but there is limited information about it in the public domain and some claimants have complained that the application process is time-consuming and bureaucratic. Warren Bennett, co-founder of A Suit That Fits, said: \"Wearing a suit has a massive effect on confidence \u2013 especially when looking for work. If we can help individuals to feel more confident when going to interviews, and therefore increase their chances of getting a job, then the campaign will have been a resounding success.\" Amber has three residential centres which each accommodate 30 young people who are referred by various organisations including the prison service, probation, Youth Offending Teams, social services, local authorities, hostels, addiction treatment agencies, other voluntary organisations as well as family and friends and self-referrals. A recent beneficiary is unemployed Jared, 20, who came to Amber in August 2011 after spending two weeks living on the streets and following a period of \"sofa surfing\". Jared said: \"I recently attended an army selection weekend and interview; for the interview I used the money I had saved since being at Amber to purchase a suit as I wanted to make a good impression.\"",

      "bodyText": "Almost half a century may have elapsed since he competed in his first Olympic games, but Hiroshi Hoketsu is poised to enter the record books after qualifying for London's 2012 Olympics at the age of 70. The former company director qualified for Japan's Olympic equestrian team after finishing in first place in the International Equestrian Federation's Asia-Oceania dressage rankings. He must now await a formal decision on his selection for individual dressage. It would be Hoketsu's third Olympics, having competed in his native Tokyo in 1964, aged 23, and again in Beijing in 2008, where he was the oldest Olympian. Now living in Aachen, in west Germany, Hoketsu said he was very pleased to have qualified, especially as his horse, Whisper, a 15-year-old mare, had suffered some problems. She is \"a little bit old, but still a good age\", Hoketsu, who will be 71 at the time of the London Olympics, told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. If he does compete, Hoketsu will increase the record he set in 2008 for being the oldest Japanese Olympics competitor, but fall a fraction short of taking the record for the oldest Olympian ever, held by Swedish shooter Oscar Swahn, who won a silver medal at the 1920 Antwerp Games aged 72, his sixth medal in three games. Hoketsu, who moved to Aachen after retiring as a director of the multinational pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson eight years ago to train full-time, has been riding Whisper for five years but had ruled out competing in the 2012 Olympics because of the horse's health. \"It started with the front legs and no one was able to determine the cause of the horse's health problems. It was very complicated,\" he said. The problems began in February last year and three different vets were unable to find a cure until eventually there was a diagnosis of tendinitis. \"I had totally given up on trying to go to London,\" he said. \"But then in mid-November a friend introduced me to a good vet and one month later I was training again, and in January I started competing again. The horse's recovery was a miracle.\" Hoketsu, who started riding at the age of 12, finished 40th in the showjumping event in Tokyo. Throughout his long equestrian career he has won several national championships and qualified for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but did not compete following quarantine issues with his horse. He was a named reserve for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, though not called. At Beijing he was part of the team that finished ninth, and in the individual dressage competition he was placed 35th. \"In London, I hope to do a little better,\" he said. \"I didn't do that well in Beijing because they had that big screen in the hall and my horse just hates to see that moving screen.\" Old and young Oscar Swahn, 72 The oldest ever Olympic competitor won silver for shooting in the 100m running deer event at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp. He was selected again in 1924 but illness forced him to withdraw. Lorna Johnstone, 70 Britain's oldest Olympian, known as the Galloping Granny, competed in dressage at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Galen Carter Spencer, 68 The American won silver in archery in the 1904 games in St Louis. Paul Cerutti, 65 Competing for Monaco in 1976, the trapshooter was disqualified after failing a drugs test. Ian Millar, 61 The Canadian showjumper competed in his ninth Olympics in Beijing in 2008, taking silver in the team event. Dimitrios Loundras, 10 The youngest identified entrant competed at the 1896 Athens Olympics for Greece, winning a team bronze in gymnastics. Katy Stoddard",

      "bodyText": "The economist Joseph Schumpeter long ago argued that crises were seedbeds of innovation and entrepreneurship. In today's economic crisis, we certainly need all the innovation we can get, particularly in addressing big social challenges, such as rising youth unemployment and the care needs of an ageing population. As a social investor that invests in and supports organisations that are using digital technology for social good, it is inspiring to see just how many social enterprises are using technology as a tool for innovation. We're seeing an ever-increasing tide of inspiring individuals who recognise the potential of technology to support new forms of collaboration, untap and reorganise resources across communities and create new opportunities for social participation. It is also interesting to see that the most effective examples of positive social change result from collaboration across the public, private and third sectors. FutureGov is an example of a social enterprise that is using technology to address a big social challenge. Recognising that there are numerous agencies involved in the complex and challenging world of child protection, FutureGov's Patchwork project used social media to put children and their families at the centre of the professional support networks, bridging the communication gaps between agencies. Patchwork is an app that enables any member of a family's team to administer their case, breaking down organisational silos in public services and also empowering frontline staff and the family to maintain an up-to-date picture of who's involved. The Patchwork prototype was co-designed in Lichfield, Staffordshire, with a project team that included children's charity Barnardo's, technologists, policy advisers and family representatives. They developed a concept for how social technology could contribute to keeping children safe. It is the buy-in and collaboration from the senior leadership teams across the various child protection agencies and support services that has been the key to Patchwork's success. As part of the prototype phase, FutureGov developed a change management methodology to ensure the technology influenced wider attitudinal change among public agencies working with children. An investment by Nominet Trust, the social enterprise I run, is helping FutureGov to develop the prototype into a service that can be scaled across all 400 UK local authority areas. Nominet Trust funding has also been able to help Cockermouth Centre for the Third Age, on the edge of the Lake District, to develop a \"virtual centre\". Using an online platform, GPs can refer patients who are lonely, mildly depressed or have mobility issues to the volunteer-run centre which offers company, help with shopping, training on the internet and generally a shoulder to lean on. In the first three months of the Cockermouth project, emergency admissions to hospital were down by 143 on the previous year. Its founders were asked by the Department of Health to write a paper on how this model for GP engagement could be replicated nationally. A key factor in the success of both projects is the early collaboration between the public, private and third sectors. Herein lies the challenge: we need to find new opportunities for cross-sector collaboration that draw on the imagination, expertise and networks across industry, government and social enterprise to develop co-designed and scalable solutions to big social challenges. These projects demonstrate how digital technology can help us to redesign how we address social challenges. At a time of financial constraint, we need to be particularly innovative in our use of resources. Technology gives us the opportunity to think differently, develop new social connections and reorganise resources across communities. When approached by nimble, enthusiastic social entrepreneurs who are prepared to test out genuinely new approaches, the role for public managers is to embrace these new forms of collaboration. \u2022 Annika Small is director of the Nominet Trust, which invests in projects where digital resources are being mobilised to create positive social change",

Recognising that there are numerous agencies involved in the complex and challenging world of child protection, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/nov/04/working-better-social-care-patchwork\" title=\"\">FutureGov's Patchwork project</a> used social media to put children and their families at the centre of the professional support networks, bridging the communication gaps between agencies.</p> <p>Patchwork is an app that enables any member of a family's team to administer their case, breaking down organisational silos in public services and also empowering frontline staff and the family to maintain an up-to-date picture of who's&#xa0;involved.</p> <p>The Patchwork prototype was co-designed in Lichfield, Staffordshire, with a project team that included children's charity Barnardo's, technologists, policy advisers and family representatives. They developed a concept for how social technology could contribute to keeping children safe. It is the buy-in and collaboration from the senior leadership teams across the various child protection agencies and support services that has been the key to Patchwork's success. As part of the prototype phase, FutureGov developed a change management methodology to ensure the technology influenced wider attitudinal change among public agencies working with children. An investment by Nominet Trust, the social enterprise I run, is helping FutureGov to develop the prototype into a service that can be scaled across all 400 UK local authority areas.</p> <p>Nominet Trust funding has also been able to help <a href=\"http://www.cockermouth.org.uk/C3A/\" title=\"\">Cockermouth Centre for the Third Age,</a> on the edge of the Lake District, to develop a \"virtual centre\". Using an online platform, GPs can refer patients who are lonely, mildly depressed or have mobility issues to the volunteer-run centre which offers company, help with shopping, training on the internet and generally a shoulder to lean on.</p> <p>In the first three months of the Cockermouth project, emergency admissions to hospital were down by 143 on the previous year. Its founders were asked by the Department of Health to write a paper on how this model for GP engagement could be replicated nationally.</p> <p>A key factor in the success of both projects is the early collaboration between the public, private and third sectors. Herein lies the challenge: we need to find new opportunities for cross-sector collaboration that draw on the imagination, expertise and networks across industry, government and social enterprise to develop co-designed and scalable solutions to big social challenges.</p> <p>These projects demonstrate how digital technology can help us to redesign how we address social challenges. At a time of financial constraint, we need to be particularly innovative in our use of resources. Technology gives us the opportunity to think differently, develop new social connections and reorganise resources across communities. When approached by nimble, enthusiastic social entrepreneurs who are prepared to test out genuinely new approaches, the role for public managers is to embrace these new forms of collaboration.</p> <p>\u2022 Annika Small is director of the <a href=\"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Nominet Trust</a>, which invests in projects where digital resources are being mobilised to create positive social change</p>",

Because it's linked to whether or not there's an earner in the household who takes home more than the \u00a342,745 threshold for paying 40% income tax, families where both parents go out to work have an in-built advantage. They can earn \u00a380,000 between them (so long as it's evenly divided), while hanging on to their child benefit. If mum (or dad) is at home looking after the kids, however, the benefit will be withdrawn when the household's total income hits \u00a342,745. As Cameron and a growing band of Tory backbenchers have begun to suggest, that differential treatment offends against basic notions of fairness: that families with the same circumstances should receive the same level of help from the state. It's extraordinary that the coalition is still having this argument now. It was evident from the moment the chancellor announced the policy in autumn 2010 that it would throw up exactly these anomalies. Yet like Gordon Brown's disastrous abolition of the 10p tax rate \u2013 overshadowed in the headlines at the time by the reduction in the basic rate of income tax it paid for \u2013 politicians have failed to focus until the moment for implementation is near, and the tide of letters from furious constituents has started to flood in. The fact is, there's no easy solution: income tax is administered completely separately for each earner \u2013 something women have long campaigned for \u2013 and there's no system of joint taxation in place to provide the kind of data necessary for full-blown means-testing. Household income as a whole is only assessed when families come into contact with the tax credits or benefits system. But many of those who will lose out here are not in that category; and the Tories want to dismantle the means-tested tax credit system, not extend it into fresh areas. The beauty of the \"cliff edge\", from the Treasury's point of view, is its simplicity, and the fact that it piggy-backs on information the state already holds. A more nuanced alternative would be likely to impose considerable administrative costs. Perhaps the vehemence of the row, and the difficulty of resolving it, should point towards the fact that attacking child benefit is the wrong place to start dismantling the welfare state, even in these painfully austere times. Maintaining democratic support for a modern, flexible welfare system means that it shouldn't just redistribute from the wealthy to the needy, but help share the burden of saving for the leanest times of our lives. That way almost everyone contributes, and almost everyone gets help when they most need it. That's the justification for establishing a generous flat-rate state pension, instead of disincentivising saving by means-testing every last penny, an idea Iain Duncan-Smith has enthusiastically embraced. By that logic, everyone should also get a helping hand with one of the toughest and most socially important jobs there is: bringing up children. And as for where else to find the money, taxing higher-rate earners on their assets \u2013 their million-pound homes, for example, if Cable gets his way with a \"mansion tax\", or the pension savings on which they currently receive more tax relief than lower earners \u2013 might be a better place to start.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson's undertaking to get to grips with knife and youth crime was one of the most welcome of his pledges during the last mayoral campaign. Since moving in to City Hall he's put time and energy into delivering. But what has really been achieved? Three members of an advisory group Boris set up to help him tackle serious youth violence have made known their disappointment with his administration's approach to the issue. The educationalist and social investment consultant Professor Gus John describes the mayoral strategy as \"directionless\" and \"a shambles.\" Leadership coach and social policy adviser Viv Ahmun believes the group's work was undermined by people around the mayor. Richard Taylor, the father of Damilola Taylor who was killed when aged 10 in south London in November 2000, was \"hugely frustrated\" by his experience with the mayor's regime. The mayor's expert advisory group (MEAG) was formed at Boris's instigation in July 2010 in response to concerns that his Time For Action programme aimed at deterring young people from crime was failing to address the specific needs of black youths in London, who are over-represented in crime statistics both as perpetrators and victims of violent and other offences. The other members of the MEAG were Bevan Powell of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, community activist churchman Nims Obunge of the Tottenham-based Peace Alliance and Ray Lewis, who Boris had begun to rehabilitate following his forced resignation as his deputy for youth in July 2008. Following a number of meetings and discussions with Boris, his then chief of staff Sir Simon Milton (who died in April 2011) and his policing deputy Kit Malthouse - who Boris has since appointed to head the new Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime - a report came out of the MEAG in January 2011 which set out the group's \"initial consolidated views\" and recommendations for developing \"an effective, long-term approach to addressing and preventing the serious youth violence that has particularly impacted on the Black community in London.\" The report argued that, \"There remains widespread official confusion about the nature of the problem and what works in practice,\" and contrasted the failures of \"top down\" public sector provision and \"community safety and policing policy\" and with emerging research showing that community-based, \"bottom up\" interventions could help to diagnose and address the issue. It described a programme of research to enhance understanding of serious youth violence as being \"essential\" and said that any failure to accurately gauge what types of interventions work \"will result in serious public health and community safety issues.\" The report stressed the importance of engaging local people in the strategy, and listed educational underachievement, the need to \"develop a narrative which addresses the challenges of families beyond current 'broken Britain' thinking,\" and the alienating psychological impact of stop-and search on innocent young black people among key issues for close attention. Lewis, Ahmun, Obunge, Powell and Taylor all signed up to the report, but Professor John, whose previous contributions it acknowledges, had resigned from the MEAG the previous month. He says it, \"Lacked credibility, purpose, integrity, everything.\" In his letter of resignation to Boris he wrote: \"From the outside, the continued operation of the group in its current form looks like a cynical exercise of going through the motions.\" John, who has previously run youth services for the Inner London Education Authority and had recently been involved with Channel 4's Street Weapons report, says he agreed to help Boris in the hope that the mayor would listen to a \"steering group, monitoring his strategy.\" But he soon concluded that Boris, \"Really only wanted people who would say what he wanted to hear.\" Though John thought some of the City Hall officers involved very competent, he describes Malthouse and Milton as \"dinosaurs,\" and \"very dismissive.\" He says, for example, that his suggestion that Boris hold a youth conference in keeping with a \"bottom up\" approach was dismissed. John is also critical of the composition of the group, which he says was in theory to be \"a conduit for community input,\" yet contained no women or young people. He feels there was confusion and conflict from the start about its role, with different members having very different ideas about what their contribution should be, and queried the transparency of criteria by which people were deemed eligible to join the group. John says that at one point the name of Shaun Bailey, the unsuccessful Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Hammersmith constituency in 2010, began to be included in correspondence to MEAG members without any explanation. He says that Boris and Ray Lewis had decided to bring Bailey in. \"It was as though people were being added to the group on a whim,\" John says. It took until mid-December 2010 \u2013 five months after the MEAG was formed \u2013 for Lewis, who chaired the group for the mayor, to produce a strategy document for discussion. John says that after giving a verbal assessment of it Lewis responded to his criticisms by saying the document was not really his work but put together by \"one of the girls in the office,\" at his Eastside Young Leaders Academy in Newham. \"We'd been waiting for this for months,\" John said, \"and when it turned up it was weak and baseless. It didn't even have a name or a date on it.\" John also produced his own discussion paper, but resigned from the MEAG on Christmas Eve 2010, a few days after a meeting with Boris. \"I didn't want to give it any credibility by being associated with it,\" he says. Viv Ahmun says he was approached by Lewis shortly after Boris's election in May 2008, when Lewis was the mayor's full-time \"deputy for youth.\" Although Ahmun had previously assisted Ken Livingstone on youth issues he says he had \"no problem,\" with doing the same for his successor, whom he already knew because their children had attended the same primary school. He recalls attending an early meeting with Kit Malthouse, who was then deputy chair of the now defunct Metropolitan Police Authority, where he says he was told that the focus of police action on serious youth violence would be stop-and-search and enforcement. Following Lewis's resignation as youth deputy in July 2008 after investigations into his past culminated in the discovery that he was not, as he had claimed, a justice of the peace, Ahmun says he had no further contact with City Hall until the summer of 2010. He felt that concerns he had raised about the forthcoming Time for Action programme had not been heeded. But he says he received a phone call from Boris, who told him that he agreed with critics who said that Time for Action wasn't working for the key group affected - young black Londoners - and asked him to join the advisory group to help put that right. \"I told him I would be happy to help if he was serious,\" Ahmun said, and stresses that he happily gave his time for free. However, he describes the ensuing months as, \"A very painful period because there was so much resistance to what we were doing.\" He says he believes the group's efforts were, \"Sabotaged behind the scenes,\" by infuential members of the mayor's team. Ahmun says that he continued to provide unpaid help with starting the mayor's mentoring scheme \u2013 which had become a key strand of Time for Action \u2013 but severed all ties after the controversial decision not to award the contract to deliver it to a consortium of black voluntary sector organisations, despite its bid twice being judged the best by a mayoral decision panel. \"It had become very political and messed up,\" Ahmun says. By this time the MEAG had effectively ceased to exist. Asked to comment on its work and the views of disappointed members City Hall issued the following statement: The Mayor and his team met on a number of occasions with a small group of individuals to discuss methods of tackling youth violence. These meetings resulted in an ambitious programme of local engagement - the Mayor's Community Conversations Programme - where the Mayor joined community leaders and local people across seven boroughs to discuss solutions to violence. The Mayor has thanked the group for their tremendous contributions and he remains committed to working on long term solutions to youth crime. A statement issued on Richard Taylor's behalf by the Damilola Taylor Trust says that \"Richard was hugely frustrated by the inability of City Hall to deliver on its promises of engagement with the youth of London especially in the areas of tackling youth crime,\" despite feeling \"from the outset that the Mayor was entirely serious about [the advisory group's] objectives.\" The statement expresses regret over \"in-fighting and disagreements,\" within the group and says that Taylor thinks the mayor's \"hands are largely tied,\" by City Hall's being \"too bureaucratic for its own good,\" resulting in a failure to achieve what it promises, for all its power and influence. The statement concludes: \"City Hall has never delivered positive results in tackling youth crime since it first took power over London in the same year that Damilola died.\" Something for Ken Livingstone to reflect on there too.",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson's undertaking to get to grips with knife and youth crime was one of the most welcome of his pledges during the last mayoral campaign. Since moving in to City Hall he's put time and energy into delivering. But what has really been achieved? </p> <p>Three members of an advisory group Boris set up to help him tackle serious youth violence have made known their disappointment with his administration's approach to the issue. The educationalist and social investment consultant Professor Gus John describes the mayoral strategy as \"directionless\" and \"a shambles.\" Leadership coach and social policy adviser <a href=\"http://coreplanuk.com/home/?page_id=283\">Viv Ahmun</a> believes the group's work was undermined by people around the mayor. Richard Taylor, the father of Damilola Taylor who was killed when aged 10 in south London in November 2000, was \"hugely frustrated\" by his experience with the mayor's regime.</p> <p>The mayor's expert advisory group (MEAG) was formed at Boris's instigation in July 2010 in response to concerns that his Time For Action programme aimed at deterring young people from crime was failing to address the specific needs of black youths in London, who are over-represented in crime statistics both as perpetrators and victims of violent and other offences. The other members of the MEAG were Bevan Powell of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, community activist churchman Nims Obunge of the Tottenham-based Peace Alliance and Ray Lewis, who Boris had begun to rehabilitate following his forced resignation as his deputy for youth in July 2008.</p> <p>Following a number of meetings and discussions with Boris, his then chief of staff Sir Simon Milton (who died in April 2011) and his policing deputy Kit Malthouse - who Boris has since appointed to head the new Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime - a <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/uk/davehillblog/interactive/2012/mar/06/meag-initial-position-paper\">report came out of the MEAG in January 2011</a> which set out the group's \"initial consolidated views\" and recommendations for developing \"an effective, long-term approach to addressing and preventing the serious youth violence that has particularly impacted on the Black community in London.\"</p> <p>The report argued that, \"There remains widespread official confusion about the nature of the problem and what works in practice,\" and contrasted the failures of \"top down\" public sector provision and \"community safety and policing policy\" and with emerging research showing that community-based, \"bottom up\" interventions could help to diagnose and address the issue. </p> <p>It described a programme of research to enhance understanding of serious youth violence as being \"essential\" and said that any failure to accurately gauge what types of interventions work \"will result in serious public health and community safety issues.\" The report stressed the importance of engaging local people in the strategy, and listed educational underachievement, the need to \"develop a narrative which addresses the challenges of families beyond current 'broken Britain' thinking,\" and the alienating psychological impact of stop-and search on innocent young black people among key issues for close attention.</p> <p>Lewis, Ahmun, Obunge, Powell and Taylor all signed up to the report, but Professor John, whose previous contributions it acknowledges, had resigned from the MEAG the previous month. He says it, \"Lacked credibility, purpose, integrity, everything.\" In his letter of resignation to Boris he wrote: \"From the outside, the continued operation of the group in its current form looks like a cynical exercise of going through the motions.\" </p> <p>John, who has previously run youth services for the Inner London Education Authority and had recently been involved with Channel 4's Street Weapons report, says he agreed to help Boris in the hope that the mayor would listen to a \"steering group, monitoring his strategy.\" But he soon concluded that Boris, \"Really only wanted people who would say what he wanted to hear.\" </p> <p>Though John thought some of the City Hall officers involved very competent, he describes Malthouse and Milton as \"dinosaurs,\" and \"very dismissive.\" He says, for example, that his suggestion that Boris hold a youth conference in keeping with a \"bottom up\" approach was dismissed.

      "bodyText": "3.42pm: We are now winding up the live blog for today, but we will be tomorrow for evidence from former Met commissioner Lord Blair, ex-deputy commissioner Tim Godwin and former former assistant commissioner (specialist operations) Bob Quick. In the meantime, you can read the latest developments on the MediaGuardian homepage and our Leveson inquiry page. 2.54pm: Lord Justice Leveson is surprised by the brevity of today's hearing. \"You have failed me, Mr Jay,\" he quips. 2.51pm: Owens has now finished her evidence. 2.50pm: One of the challenges the police face is it is quite difficult to get measured and balanced reports in the media because the sensational and exciting developments are the ones that hit the headlines, says Owens. She says she finds it \"abhorrent that any police officer\" could leak information about celebrities when they show up at the police station. \"I don't think people who behave like that should be in the police service,\" she adds. 2.45pm: Owens says all meetings are logged onto a database, this includes all on-the-record and off-the-record contacts. One of the matters under review is that perhaps too many things are being recorded, leading to potential omissions. 2.44pm: Jay asks if her view is the policy is not sufficiently austere or if is it austere enough. Owens says her \"preliminary view is that generally it is in the right space\" but she is not sure if it makes sufficient distinction between senior staff and frontline staff. 2.43pm: Jay asks about Surrey police and its policy on hospitality. An unsolicited gift would be politely declined. When an offer of a meal is made and it is the interest of the force to attend, then the correct officials are contacted. This policy is being reviewed in light of the Filkin and O'Connor reports. 2.36pm: Owens says journalists found it \"slightly strange\" that she would not meet them for lunch or in a social setting. Leveson asks her what she means by this comment in the written statement that she \"had not experienced any of the recent difficult history whereby the effectiveness of the MPS and its senior leaders was judged through media reporting\". She says she still engaged with the media; she would rather explain to the press the \"totality\" of the police story rather than have commentary based on gossip and piecemeal information. 2.30pm: Owens says did not received media training in London but has received it at other times. 2.28pm: Owens says she preferred not to meet journalists for a drink because there would be an expectation that she should say something that she otherwise would not. She declined to give her mobile number out to journalists. Jay asks if this policy of never meeting the press socially is a little \"austere\". 2.25pm: Lynne Owens, chief constable of Surrey police, is the last witness of the day. She was appointed to her position last month. In her previous rule as an assistant commisisoner of the Metropolitan police, she was responsible for security at the royal wedding, Barack Obama's visit and was involved in the Met's response to last summer's rioting. She will be largely be questioned on her time at the Met. 2.25pm: Stevens has now finished his testimony. 2.21pm: Jay asks id Stevens is being \"diffident\" about his reasons for leaving the News of the World because he was picking up rumours about phone hacking. Stevens says no, this wasn't the reason for ending his column at the News of the World. [It was the] convictions of Goodman and Mulcaire, my thoughts about that and the thoughts about the admission of that and the resignation of Andy Coulson.... The whole thing just didn't seem right to me and I had to get out. 2.19pm: Stevens is asked about the investigation into the murder of Daniel Morgan and if he was aware the News of the World put detective Dave Cook and his wife Jacqui Hames, under surveillance. Stevens says: \"No.\" 2.18pm: Stevens says he became aware that a number of newspapers were receiving information from an unidentified police officer. This individual and those surrounding him were selling stories to whoever would buy them. Some of it was \"salacious gossip\". 2.17pm: They are now talking about private investigator Southern Investigations. Stevens says he was never aware that News of the World used it. In his book his says that at the end of the 1990s it kept coming up in the \"anti-corruption squad's radar\". The agency was set up by murdered private eye Daniel Morgan. 2.15pm: Stevens says he used to meet the MPA at least once a week. Most of them were experienced people. Lord Harris of Haringey, the first chair of the MPA, had decided that all of these meetings should be open. Stevens said it was an examination beyond what he had experienced before. 2.05pm: The inquiry has resumed and Jay is revisits Stevens's remarks about \"unethical behaviour\" that led him to sever his ties with the News of the World, where he was contracted to write a column. He says this revolved around an article concerning Max Mosley. Jay points out that the infamous article about Mosley appeared in April 2008, but Stevens had terminated his contract in October 2007. Stevens is pressed on what he means by \"unethical behaviour\". \"General behaviour,\" he says. Asked whether this means phone hacking or behaviour more widely, he says: \"Just more widely.\" 1.00pm: The inquiry has now broken for lunch and will resume at 2pm. 1.00pm: Stevens says he had a system called \"ethical testing\" and that strategy \u2013 which wasn't far from being an \"agent provocateur\" \u2013 did not turn up \"any real issue on my watch\". 12.58pm: Stevens says he was aware of allegations of corruption in relation to the press. \"Every now and then\" he heard stories that people either still employed or retired were being paid for stories or for tipping people off about where raids were taking place. 12.56pm: Asked about politicians, Stevens says the former home secretary David Blunkett briefed the press against him behind his back. He says Blunkett didn't understand his relationship with the Metropolitan Police Authority. 12.54pm: Jay returns to the issue of leaks \u2013 this time in relation to Stevens's Northern Ireland inquiries. He says he can usually work out who is gaining by the leak, but it is a \"very difficult business\" identifying the person responsible. However, there were prosecutions for leaks in Northern Ireland. He says at the Met his deputy, Ian Blair, would have been responsible for leak inquiries. 12.49pm: Stevens says he does not think \"professional relationships could have been fostered without some sort of hospitality\". \"This is the way they did business \u2013 if you didn't do it that way, they probably wouldn't see you,\" says Stevens. 12.48pm: Stevens revisits his dealings with Rebekah Wade and Paul Dacre, reiterating that his meetings with the former concerned Sarah's Law and the latter was very keen on the investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. 12.46pm: Stevens says he has heard people in the Met \"are terrified\" of picking up the phone to the press in the current climate. 12.37pm: Stevens says he was paid \u00a35,000 each for the first two News of the World articles, which was a vast amount as far as he was concerned, but he \"was told this was the going rate\". Wallis edited the articles. He quit after two articles because of the conviction of NoW royal editor Clive Goodman and investigator Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking in 2007. Stevens resigned the contract in October 2007 which was nine months or so after the convictions. He revealed however that when the convictions were taking place, \"certain other information was coming to my ears\" which alarmed him. \"I didn't just want to do it,\" he adds. Stevens says: I didn't complete that contract because of the conviction that took place of the two people in the News of the World, and I saw Colin Myler and Neil Wallis and told them I didn't want to continue. I never gave them specific reasons, but from that night on I never saw them again. The remaining five articles were negotiated at \u00a37,000 apiece. \"With five articles to write it was throwing away a lot of money,\" he says. \"I'd never have written the articles had I known what I know now.\" 12.34pm: Jay moves on to the \"revolving door\" between police and the press following retirement. Stevens was hired to write seven articles for the News of the World, arranged by his book publisher through managing editor Stuart Kuttner. This was part of the package negotiated around his autobiography Not for the Faint Hearted. He reveals he lost all the proceeds from his autobiography after the Northern Rock bank collapsed. 12.30pm: Jay quotes the Met's 2003 gifts and hospitality policy. It says the perception of suspicion is as important as the facts. It says light working lunches in the region of \u00a310 are acceptable, but \u00a3150 dinners are not, except in exceptional circumstances. Jay says private dinners raise a difficult issue. 12.29pm: Stevens says he found it difficult to get some stories into the papers. For example, Scotland Yard held awards to commend officers on their bravery every six weeks to two months, and it was \"incredibly difficult\" to get coverage. 12.27pm: Stevens agrees with Condon's evidence that the press should not be \"pariahs\". To use Lord Condon's pharase they weren't pariahs; they were highly professional people who I respected immensely. 12.26pm: Stevens says he had to sue the press twice. Once was when he complained to the PCC after it was reported he believed in legalising cannabis and the second time was inaccurate reporting on his level of pay. 12.22pm: Stevens says he finds it hard to criticise his successors, but says he thinks he would have been \"ruthless\" on phone hacking. I would like to have thought the issues that the Guardian raised I would have picked up as commissioner. I think I would have been quite ruthless in pursuing it. Stevens says he would have gone where the investigation took him wherever that may be. \"I know of no other way of pursuing wrongdoing,\" he says. 12.22pm: Stevens is asked how he would describe his relationship with Neil Wallis. \"It was totally professional,\" says Stevens. \"I never went to his house or he to mine.\" 12.19pm: In 2002, there was dinner with Neil Wallis at Convivio. This was one of the two charity events Stevens referred to ealier. In September 2003, Stevens dined with the News of the World's Wallis, Andy Coulson and Stuart Kutter, as well as Dick Fedorcio. This was part of the general pattern of meeting with editors, he says. 12.16pm: In 2002, there was dinner with Rebekah Wade and her then husband Ross Kemp at the Ivy. Stevens says from 2000 to 2005, he met up with Wade 12 times, three times of which were for charity. \"Ross Kemp very kindly agreed to front an evening,\" he says. \"My wife was at two of these and on one of those ocassions I personally paid at the Ivy.\" 12.14pm: In Oct/Nov 2000, there was a meeting with Wallis and Waheed Alii \u2013 the former Planet 24 owner and now Labour peer. Stevens wanted Alli, who was a friend of Wallis, as an adviser to the Met. In June 2001 there was a dinner with Neil Wallis, editor of the People. 12.12pm: On 16 October 2000, Stevens had lunch with Rebekah Wade, editor of the News of the World, with Andy Coulson in a hotel in W1 \u2013 he thinks that was the Sanderson Hotel. \"I always saw Rebekah Wade with the DPA,\" he says. \"She was pursuing Sarah's Law and at that stage she had threats to her \u2026 so the conversations were Sarah's Law and [issues] pursuant to that.\" 12.11pm: Stevens's diary details a dinner with Neil Wallis, the former deputy editor of the News of the World, at the Birdcage, a restaurant in London W1, in 2000. Stevens says he met Wallis twice with their wives in relation to a charity. 12.10pm: Stevens's diary shows he had frequent meetings with the press across all newspapers. On occasion there were dinners with Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail. He says he did not favour one newspaper group and the diary bears this out. 12.09pm: Lord Stevens's witness statement has now been published on the Leveson inquiry website. 12.07pm: Stevens said he had lunches with the editors of all papers but Dick Fedorcio, the director of public affairs, would always attend. He had more frequent \u2013 quarterly \u2013 meetings with Evening Standard editors Sir Max Hastings and Veronica Wadley because he considered it the \"local newspaper for London\". 12.06pm: Lord Condon's witness statement has now been published on the Leveson inquiry website. 12.05pm: Stevens says he was keen to take media on police operations because it showed how the Met was tackling crime. However, like Condon, he says it shouldn't interfere with an individual's right to a fair trial. 12.04pm: Stevens says the people who are on the frontline tell the story \"far better\" than senior officers. But there are always inherent risks in allowing officers to speak to journalists. \"The risk is you are exposing people who haven't had full training in dealing with the press,\" he adds. 11.57am: Stevens explains what he means by \"off the record\", and says it depended on the context. He says if a police officer is offering comment it is \"very dangerous territory\". He says it is in the public interest for the police to give off-the-record briefings to editors, for example, on anti-terrorism. Stevens adds he is cynical about the phrase \"police sources\" as it could cover an officer who is not involved in the story or someone who may not even be in the police force. 11.52am: Stevens drew up a policy to reinforce confidence in the force and part of this involved a strategy in relation to the media covering three areas: proactive; reactive; and media training. He says he was one of first officers to get media training, and was told on an an FBI course: \"Never to tell lies to the press.\" Stevens says the policy required officers to be \"open and honest\". 11.49am: The Met's relationship with the media was built on mistrust before he arrived as deputy commissioner in 1998, says Condon. He adds that the reason people didn't want to deal with the media was because they thought it would be counterproductive and they would be criticised. 11.47am: Stevens is currently the chair of Labour's \"independent review\" into the future of policing, which has all-party support. He says he hopes it will take into account the Leveson inquiry's findings and report next year. 11.46am: Stevens says he wanted to engineer a culture change, which he says were successful. Complaints against the police had dropped 50%; crime was coming down; and the Met had managed to divert IRA terrorist attacks. 11.45am: Stevens says his new policy was not to banish bad news stories \u2013 the nature of policing means there are always bad news stories \u2013 but he wanted to allow \"officers on the street to tell their stories far more in a positive fashion\". \"I know good news doesn't sell newspapers or the media, but we were going to try and do some of that,\" he tells the inquiry. 11.44am: Stevens says the Met was dealing with crisis management, but dealing with the media was only one part of the strategy. \"The media were a major part of it, but it was a matter of getting on the front foot \u2026 and getting the anti-corruption practices that we developed at that time. 11.42am: Stevens says the Met lost hundreds of officers in the wake of the Macpherson report and by 2000 it found recruitment difficult. \"No one thought the Met was an organisation worth joining,\" he adds. 11.40am: As deputy commissioner at the Met from 1998, Stevens oversaw a major anti-corruption initiative. The Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence was published in 1999 and found the police force was institutionally racist. Jay asks how that affected his relationship with the media. Stevens says it had a \"massive effect\" because ordinary officers felt they were all being painted as racist. 11.39am: Stevens joined the police in 1962 and remained there for 23 years. He took a break and returned to the force in Hampshire and Cambridge. He had a standout stint in northern Ireland where he led what turned out to be a 20-year investigation into alleged collusion between loyalists and the police force. 11.35am: The inquiry has resumed and Condon's successor as Met commissioner, Lord Stevens, takes the stand. Robery Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, is doing the questioning. 11.26am: Lord Condon has finished giving evidence and the inquiry is taking a short break. 11.25am: Leveson asks Condon how he would achieve long-lasting change. Condon says that before Christmas he spent some time with HMIC chief Sir Dennis O'Connor to discuss this very matter. He said he will respond to Leveson's question at length later. He says the challenge is \"if you have police officers, tweeting, blogging, the service is at the point where it needs to totally recalibrate how it communicates directly to the public.\" The service has to \"get its act together nationally\" on this issue, he adds. 11.21am: Condon says police discipline is \"cyclical\"; \"it's about human weakness and opportunity and those two are omnipresent\". He tells Leveson it goes: \"scandal, inquiry, remedial action, relaxation, complacency, scandal \u2026 that's been on a 20-year cycle\". He adds that malpractice is very basic: it is about human weakness and while the Met will be \"chomping at the bit\", the challenge will be to make changes that are lasting. 11.18am: Condon says he has been very disappointed by some of the issues that led to the Leveson inquiry. He adds that had he been still involved in the police service, he would have been very angry. 11.18am: The Guardian's Josh Halliday has been tweeting from the high court, where former New Zealand and Nottinghamshire cricketer Chris Cairns is claiming substantial damages from former Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi for an alleged libel on Twitter: Chris Cairns is being cross examined by QC for Lalit Modi in libel trial over tweet accusing fmr New Zealand cricket captain of match fixing \u2014 Josh Halliday (@JoshHalliday) March 6, 2012 and QC for Modi alleges that Cairns \"deepened suspicion on himself\" by accepting cash payments of \u00bb100k before major tourn. Cairns disagrees. \u2014 Josh Halliday (@JoshHalliday) March 6, 2012 and Lalit Modi sat patiently observing at back right of court. Cairns wife front left. She will give evidence during two-week trial. \u2014 Josh Halliday (@JoshHalliday) March 6, 2012 and It's a judge-only trial, by the way. Was previously going to be heard before jury but very rare these days. Last was more than two years ago \u2014 Josh Halliday (@JoshHalliday) March 6, 2012 11.13am: Condon says the current threat to restrict meetings between the press and media would be a backward step. He adds it would be wrong to make journalists \"pariahs\". He says it would be a bureaucratic nightmare if every time a police officer was within 50 yards of a journalist, they would have to write up some sort of record. This is in contrast to Elizabeth Filkin, who gave evidence to the inquiry yesterday that she has recommended that officers record every meeting with journalists and restrict off-the-record briefings. 11.10am: Condon says he was attacked in a 1998 article by former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie, who was then working for TalkSport. He says he remembers at the time wondering what had caused MacKenzie to write the article, but thinks it must have been his stance on leaks. 11.09am: Condon is asked about police leaks to the media. He says in a force of 45,000, occasionally there may be leaks for different motivations and probably occasionally for \"financial reasons\". 11.07am: Condon says he had some very \"seductive offers\" either from publishers or agents and all of those would have had serialisation rights element, but these were never explored as he didn't take up any of the offers. He says he was offered a column with the Telegraph group, and had a limited approach from the People, which offered to \"ghost\" a column for him. Condon adds he doesn't remember any specific approaches from the Murdoch stable. 11.06am: Condon is asked about the \"revolving door\" that sometimes sees police working for the media following retirement. He says he refused all offers to write an autobiography. \"I declined not because I saw anything morally or ethically wrong per se,\" he says. \"Having spent my career majoring on integrity, indepenence, being apolitical, it just seemed I would have to take decisions to be partial or be drawn into favouring one group over another. \"My view is there is nothing inherently wrong with that but it would have taken me out of my comfort zone.\" 11.03am: Condon says he launched what he calls the \"blush test\" for his officers: Every meeting with the press that involves hospitality should be able to pass what some people have described as the blush test: would you be happy for a local politician, a neighbour, a member of your family [to be at the meeting] \u2013 does this meeting feel right? 11.02am: Condon says after the 1995 Nolan committee investigating cash for questions, the Met set up new guidelines for hospitality at the Met covering gifts, payment for interviews, hospitality and contacts. It also set up hospitality registers for the first time. 10.54am: Party Hoskins says Condon says in his witness statement that \"Hospitality is the start of a grooming process that can lead to inappropriate or unethical behaviour.\" He says that inappropriate closeness with journalists can ultimately lead to criminal behaviour. 10.53am: Condon recalls how he gave a confidential briefing on IRA terrorism and how it remained off the record. The Met briefed on the sort of the attack and the nature of the surveillance, which would go on for months at a stretch. If the editors or their reporters started to pick up information and published it, it would have been damaging to the counter-terrorism initiative. 10.49am: Condon says his preference was that meetings were held at Scotland Yard or at the journalists' newspaper. Only on \"a small handful of occasions\" were they in a restaurant. Condon said former Daily Telegraph and London Evening Standard editor Max Hastings was an exception. \"Max Hastings as editor of the Telegraph and the Evening Standard always moaned about the quality of food at Scotland Yard and I think I weakened and I probably had lunch with Max, probably at his club,\" he says. \"I remember the doyen of the crime reporters, Peter Burden, I remember having a lunch with him at the end of this time when he was retiring. \"I remember a lunch or a dinner with an editor of the Sun, Stuart Higgins.\" 10.41am: Condon says he invited all print, TV and radio editors to brief them on his planned reforms. He says he aimed to brief each of the editors once a year. He held about eight to 12 meetings a year with editors. He says the commissioner must be totally apolitical and without favourites in the media. \"No editor seems to have had more than one [meeting] a year,\" says Condon. This is in contrast to yesterday's evidence when the inquiry heard how the last commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, met former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis several times a year. 10.36am: Condon is asked about how he built relationships with journalists. He says it had been a longstanding arrangement that the commisisoner of the day met with crime reporters. In his time, this practice \"petered out\" and meetings with the Crime Reporters' Association were no longer monthly events. The CRA didn't seem to be as \"tight\" or elitist as the parliamentary lobby, Condon says. 10.35am: Condon says it was \"a sensitive issue\" to invite the media to witness the arrests. The dignity and the rights of the suspects had to be respected so the footage would not be the police in someone's bedroom at 6am in the morning, but pictures of police breaking into the premises. He says he would have been very angry if he had seen anything that showed the media had trespassed into private property. \"They [these raids] were very tightly controlled,\" he says. 10.29am: Condon gives as an example as Operation Bumblebee, the campaign to reduce domestic burglary. He says the Met staged events that \"captured the imagination and transferred fear from the public to the burglars\", such as making 200-300 arrests on one day. The media would be told about this and there would be dramatic footage of the raids. Condon would front such events through personal briefings and interviews. 10.28am: Condon says the Met did not have a website until 1996 or 1997, and previously a small number of editors and leader writers dominated the media agenda around policing. The internet and social media have given the police more opportunities to communicate directly to the public, but in his era a high level of contact with the media was necessary. 10.28am: Condon says his dealings with the media were completely different from anything he had encountered before. However, he tells Patry Hoskins, this did not detract from his ability to fight crime. \"Rightly or wrongly, the commissioner is seen as the voice of the police force,\" he adds. 10.26am: Stevens says his professional relationship with the media became \"a significant part of my life and at times would completely dominate it\". He had to deal with IRA terrorism in his time as well as the royal family and the policing of London, in itself a huge job. \"There would be insatiable demand for the commissioner of the day to be saying things about it, to be saying things to the public,\" he adds. 10.23am: Condon has been out of the force now for 13 years and says he is reluctant to comment on the police force currently but says he would be amazed if there wasn't a serious attitude to malpratice. 10.21am: Condon says he was delighted to get John Stevens in has his deputy in 1998 as he was able to carry through his policy when he took over in 2000. One of the key planks of the strategy was detection of corruption. One of the issues identified was to research cultural issues that might act as a barrier to staff whistleblowing. \"Some people think its wrong to inform on their colleagues, some might be frightened to do it \u2026 What I was seeking to do was to leigitimise, to demand and to encourage, that it was the right thing to do to whistleblow.\" 10.19am: Everyone in the Met would have been in no doubt by the end of 1998 how serious it was about dealing with the issues of corruption, he says. The strategy document was not an \"ephemeral, quick in and out\" policy on corruption, he adds. 10.15am: Condon says he started a campaign that eventually led to changes in regulations on police discipline. His anti-corruption strategy was the culmination of a number of years work \u2013 1997 and 1998 were particularly busy. Early in 1998 he remembers, that with warrants, the Met raided the homes of about 30 serving and retired police officers. He wanted before the end of 1998 to deal with the malpractice and produced a document to define the \"rules of engagement\" on corruption. 10.12am: Patry Hoskins asks Condon about his experience of countering police corruption. When he was appointed as head of the Met in 1993, he was briefed on a number of corrupt officers. There was a hope and expectation that he would find ways of responding to this challenge. Condon says in any big force \"there will always be a small number of police officers who can sadly be drawn into criminal matters\". Police corruption linked to the media was \"not part of the briefing and at the time was not my concern,\" he says. He says the motivation for corruption was \"primarily financial gain\". 10.07am: Condon joined the police force in 1967, and is a former chief constable of Kent police. He was commissioner of the Met from 1993 to 2000, when he was succeeded by his deputy, Lord Stevens. He is an independent member of the House of Lords, and is chairman of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit. He has served on a number of commercial boards in the US and Australia. 10.04am: Lord Condon, the former Met commissioner, will be the first witness. Carine Patry Hoskins, junior counsel to the inquiry, is doing the questioning. 10.04am: The inquiry has now begun. 9.57am: After leaving the Met, Condon's roles have included setting up the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit. After the Pakistan match-fixing scandal, Condon said the the ICC should have the \"nuclear option\" of ultimately excluding national boards who fail to clean up the sport in their country. He went on to praise the News of the World for its involvement in exposing the scandal, adding: I've congratulated the News of The World because this was a sting that was done very well and I think they have done cricket a great service. If the ICC had done this it probably would not have got to court because rules around entrapment are complex. The News of The World had the freedom and courage to take this on and, although this was a huge embarrassment, it was necessary. 9.48am: Good morning and welcome to the Leveson live blog. Today we hear from two former Met commissioners and the most senior officer at Surrey police, the force responsible for the investigation into the murder of Milly Dowler. The Inquiry will hear evidence from Lord Condon, Lord Stevens and Lynne Owens. Condon's term at the top of the Met from 1993 to 2000 has been described as \"the most traumatic six years a commissioner has faced\". He was said to have a business-like approach to policing and launched major anti-corruption and anti-racism initiatives. His legacy was badly tarnished by the force's failure to investigate the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Stevens was Met commissioner from 2000 to 2005, and is now the chair of Labour's \"independent review\" into the future of policing. In January he said the review was needed in place of a royal commission on policing, the last of which took place around 50 years ago. He said the issue he was most concerned about was morale, identifying this as a potential challenge with the Olympics. The third witness is Owens, appointed as chief constable of Surrey police in 2012. She was responsible for the security for the royal wedding last year and will have a role in the Olympics security.

Stevens says no, this wasn't the reason for ending his column at the News of the World.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[It was the] convictions of Goodman and Mulcaire, my thoughts about that and the thoughts about the admission of that and the resignation of Andy Coulson....</p> <p>The whole thing just didn't seem right to me and I had to get out. </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 75 --> <p>2.19pm: Stevens is asked about the investigation into the murder of Daniel Morgan and if he was aware the News of the World put detective Dave Cook and his wife Jacqui Hames, under surveillance.</p> <p>Stevens says: \"No.\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p>2.18pm: Stevens says he became aware that a number of newspapers were receiving information from an unidentified police officer.</p> <p>This individual and those surrounding him were selling stories to whoever would buy them. Some of it was \"salacious gossip\".</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p>2.17pm: They are now talking about private investigator Southern Investigations.</p> <p>Stevens says he was never aware that News of the World used it.</p> <p>In his book his says that at the end of the 1990s it kept coming up in the \"anti-corruption squad's radar\".</p> <p>The agency was set up by murdered private eye Daniel Morgan.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p>2.15pm: Stevens says he used to meet the MPA at least once a week. Most of them were experienced people.</p> <p>Lord Harris of Haringey, the first chair of the MPA, had decided that all of these meetings should be open. Stevens said it was an examination beyond what he had experienced before.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p>2.05pm: The inquiry has resumed and Jay is revisits Stevens's remarks about \"unethical behaviour\" that led him to sever his ties with the News of the World, where he was contracted to write a column.</p> <p>He says this revolved around an article concerning Max Mosley.</p> <p>Jay points out that the infamous article about Mosley appeared in April 2008, but Stevens had terminated his contract in October 2007. </p> <p>Stevens is pressed on what he means by \"unethical behaviour\". \"General behaviour,\" he says.</p> <p>Asked whether this means phone hacking or behaviour more widely, he says: \"Just more widely.\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p>1.00pm: The inquiry has now broken for lunch and will resume at 2pm.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p>1.00pm: Stevens says he had a system called \"ethical testing\" and that strategy \u2013 which wasn't far from being an \"agent provocateur\" \u2013&#xa0;did not turn up \"any real issue on my watch\".</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p>12.58pm: Stevens says he was aware of allegations of corruption in relation to the press.</p> <p>\"Every now and then\" he heard stories that people either still employed or retired were being paid for stories or for tipping people off about where raids were taking place.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>12.56pm: Asked about politicians, Stevens says the former home secretary David Blunkett briefed the press against him behind his back.</p> <p>He says Blunkett didn't understand his relationship with the Metropolitan Police Authority.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p>12.54pm: Jay returns to the issue of leaks \u2013 this time in relation to Stevens's Northern Ireland inquiries.</p> <p>He says he can usually work out who is gaining by the leak, but it is a \"very difficult business\" identifying the person responsible.</p> <p>However, there were prosecutions for leaks in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>He says at the Met his deputy, Ian Blair, would have been responsible for leak inquiries.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p>12.49pm: Stevens says he does not think \"professional relationships could have been fostered without some sort of hospitality\".</p> <p>\"This is the way they did business \u2013 if you didn't do it that way, they probably wouldn't see you,\" says Stevens.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p>12.48pm: Stevens revisits his dealings with Rebekah Wade and Paul Dacre, reiterating that his meetings with the former concerned Sarah's Law and the latter was very keen on the investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p>12.46pm: Stevens says he has heard people in the Met \"are terrified\" of picking up the phone to the press in the current climate.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p>12.37pm: Stevens says he was paid \u00a35,000 each for the first two News of the World articles, which was a vast amount as far as he was concerned, but he \"was told this was the going rate\". Wallis edited the articles.</p> <p>He quit after two articles because of the conviction of NoW royal editor Clive Goodman and investigator Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking in 2007.</p> <p>Stevens resigned the contract in October 2007 which was nine months or so after the convictions.</p> <p>He revealed however that when the convictions were taking place, \"certain other information was coming to my ears\" which alarmed him. \"I didn't just want to do it,\" he adds.</p> <p>Stevens says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn't complete that contract because of the conviction that took place of the two people in the News of the World, and I saw Colin Myler and Neil Wallis and told them I didn't want to continue. I never gave them specific reasons, but from that night on I never saw them again.</p> </blockquote> <p>The remaining five articles were negotiated at \u00a37,000 apiece. </p> <p>\"With five articles to write it was throwing away a lot of money,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I'd never have written the articles had I known what I know now.\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p>12.34pm: Jay moves on to the \"revolving door\" between police and the press following retirement.</p> <p>Stevens was hired to write seven articles for the News of the World, arranged by his book publisher through managing editor Stuart Kuttner. This was part of the package negotiated around his autobiography Not for the Faint Hearted.</p> <p>He reveals he lost all the proceeds from his autobiography after the Northern Rock bank collapsed.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p>12.30pm: Jay quotes the Met's 2003 gifts and hospitality policy. It says the perception of suspicion is as important as the facts.</p> <p>It says light working lunches in the region of \u00a310 are acceptable, but \u00a3150 dinners are not, except in exceptional circumstances. </p> <p>Jay says private dinners raise a difficult issue.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p>12.29pm: Stevens says he found it difficult to get some stories into the papers. For example, Scotland Yard held awards to commend officers on their bravery every six weeks to two months, and it was \"incredibly difficult\" to get coverage.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p>12.27pm: Stevens agrees with Condon's evidence that the press should not be \"pariahs\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To use Lord Condon's pharase they weren't pariahs; they were highly professional people who I respected immensely. </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 57 --> <p>12.26pm: Stevens says he had to sue the press twice.</p> <p>Once was when he complained to the PCC after it was reported he believed in legalising cannabis and the second time was inaccurate reporting on his level of pay.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p>12.22pm: Stevens says he finds it hard to criticise his successors, but says he thinks he would have been \"ruthless\" on phone hacking.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would like to have thought the issues that the Guardian raised I would have picked up as commissioner. I think I would have been quite ruthless in pursuing it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stevens says he would have gone where the investigation took him wherever that may be.</p> <p>\"I know of no other way of pursuing wrongdoing,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p>12.22pm: Stevens is asked how he would describe his relationship with Neil Wallis.</p> <p>\"It was totally professional,\" says Stevens. \"I never went to his house or he to mine.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p>12.19pm: In 2002, there was dinner with Neil Wallis at Convivio. This was one of the two charity events Stevens referred to ealier.</p> <p>In September 2003, Stevens dined with the News of the World's Wallis, Andy Coulson and Stuart Kutter, as well as Dick Fedorcio. This was part of the general pattern of meeting with editors, he says.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p>12.16pm: In 2002, there was dinner with Rebekah Wade and her then husband Ross Kemp at the Ivy.</p> <p>Stevens says from 2000 to 2005, he met up with Wade 12 times, three times of which were for charity.</p> <p>\"Ross Kemp very kindly agreed to front an evening,\" he says. \"My wife was at two of these and on one of those ocassions I personally paid at the Ivy.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p>12.14pm: In Oct/Nov 2000, there was a meeting with Wallis and Waheed Alii \u2013 the former Planet 24 owner and now Labour peer. Stevens wanted Alli, who was a friend of Wallis, as an adviser to the Met.</p> <p>In June 2001 there was a dinner with Neil Wallis, editor of the People.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p>12.12pm: On 16 October 2000, Stevens had lunch with Rebekah Wade, editor of the News of the World, with Andy Coulson in a hotel in W1 \u2013&#xa0;he thinks that was the Sanderson Hotel. </p> <p>\"I always saw Rebekah Wade with the DPA,\" he says. \"She was pursuing Sarah's Law and at that stage she had threats to her \u2026 so the conversations were Sarah's Law and [issues] pursuant to that.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p>12.11pm: Stevens's diary details a dinner with Neil Wallis, the former deputy editor of the News of the World, at the Birdcage, a restaurant in London W1, in 2000.</p> <p>Stevens says he met Wallis twice with their wives in relation to a charity.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p>12.10pm: Stevens's diary shows he had frequent meetings with the press across all newspapers. On occasion there were dinners with Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail.</p> <p>He says he did not favour one newspaper group and the diary bears this out.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p>12.09pm: Lord Stevens's witness statement <a href=\"http://t.co/ecAWsSNt\">has now been published</a> on the Leveson inquiry website.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p>12.07pm: Stevens said he had lunches with the editors of all papers but Dick Fedorcio, the director of public affairs, would always attend.</p> <p>He had more frequent \u2013 quarterly \u2013 meetings with Evening Standard editors Sir Max Hastings and Veronica Wadley because he considered it the \"local newspaper for London\".</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p>12.06pm: Lord Condon's witness statement <a href=\"http://t.co/zep72f4b\">has now been published</a> on the Leveson inquiry website.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p>12.05pm: Stevens says he was keen to take media on police operations because it showed how the Met was tackling crime.</p> <p>However, like Condon, he says it shouldn't interfere with an individual's right to a fair trial.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>12.04pm: Stevens says the people who are on the frontline tell the story \"far better\" than senior officers. But there are always inherent risks in allowing officers to speak to journalists.</p> <p>\"The risk is you are exposing people who haven't had full training in dealing with the press,\" he adds.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p>11.57am: Stevens explains what he means by \"off the record\", and says it depended on the context. He says if a police officer is offering comment it is \"very dangerous territory\".</p> <p>He says it is in the public interest for the police to give off-the-record briefings to editors, for example, on anti-terrorism.</p> <p>Stevens adds he is cynical about the phrase \"police sources\" as it could cover an officer who is not involved in the story or someone who may not even be in the police force.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>11.52am: Stevens drew up a policy to reinforce confidence in the force and part of this involved a strategy in relation to the media covering three areas: proactive; reactive; and media training.</p> <p>He says he was one of first officers to get media training, and was told on an an FBI course: \"Never to tell lies to the press.\"</p> <p>Stevens says the policy required officers to be \"open and honest\".</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>11.49am: The Met's relationship with the media was built on mistrust before he arrived as deputy commissioner in 1998, says Condon.</p> <p>He adds that the reason people didn't want to deal with the media was because they thought it would be counterproductive and they would be criticised.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>11.47am: Stevens is currently the chair of Labour's \"independent review\" into the future of policing, which has all-party support. </p> <p>He says he hopes it will take into account the Leveson inquiry's findings and report next year.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p>11.46am: Stevens says he wanted to engineer a culture change, which he says were successful.</p> <p>Complaints against the police had dropped 50%; crime was coming down; and the Met had managed to divert IRA terrorist attacks.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>11.45am: Stevens says his new policy was not to banish bad news stories \u2013 the nature of policing means there are always bad news stories \u2013 but he wanted to allow \"officers on the street to tell their stories far more in a positive fashion\".</p> <p>\"I know good news doesn't sell newspapers or the media, but we were going to try and do some of that,\" he tells the inquiry.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>11.44am: Stevens says the Met was dealing with crisis management, but dealing with the media was only one part of the strategy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"The media were a major part of it, but it was a matter of getting on the front foot \u2026 and getting the anti-corruption practices that we developed at that time.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>11.42am: Stevens says the Met lost hundreds of officers in the wake of the Macpherson report and by 2000 it found recruitment difficult. </p> <p>\"No one thought the Met was an organisation worth joining,\" he adds.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>11.40am: As deputy commissioner at the Met from 1998, Stevens oversaw a major anti-corruption initiative.</p> <p>The Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence was published in 1999 and found the police force was institutionally racist.</p> <p>Jay asks how that affected his relationship with the media.</p> <p>Stevens says it had a \"massive effect\" because ordinary officers felt they were all being painted as racist.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>11.39am: Stevens joined the police in 1962 and remained there for 23 years. He took a break and returned to the force in Hampshire and Cambridge.</p> <p>He had a standout stint in northern Ireland where he led what turned out to be a 20-year investigation into alleged collusion between loyalists and the police force.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>11.35am: The inquiry has resumed and Condon's successor as Met commissioner, <strong>Lord Stevens</strong>, takes the stand.</p> <p>Robery Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, is doing the questioning.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>11.26am: Lord Condon has finished giving evidence and the inquiry is taking a short break.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>11.25am: Leveson asks Condon how he would achieve long-lasting change.</p> <p>Condon says that before Christmas he spent some time with HMIC chief Sir Dennis O'Connor to discuss this very matter. He said he will respond to Leveson's question at length later.</p> <p>He says the challenge is \"if you have police officers, tweeting, blogging, the service is at the point where it needs to totally recalibrate how it communicates directly to the public.\"</p> <p>The service has to \"get its act together nationally\" on this issue, he adds.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>11.21am: Condon says police discipline is \"cyclical\"; \"it's about human weakness and opportunity and those two are omnipresent\".</p> <p>He tells Leveson it goes: \"scandal, inquiry, remedial action, relaxation, complacency, scandal \u2026 that's been on a 20-year cycle\".</p> <p>He adds that malpractice is very basic: it is about human weakness and while the Met will be \"chomping at the bit\", the challenge will be to make changes that are lasting.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>11.18am: Condon says he has been very disappointed by some of the issues that led to the Leveson inquiry.</p> <p>He adds that had he been still involved in the police service, he would have been very angry.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>11.18am: The Guardian's Josh Halliday has been tweeting from the high court, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/05/chris-cairns-libel-high-court\">former New Zealand and Nottinghamshire cricketer Chris Cairns is claiming substantial damages from former Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi for an alleged libel on Twitter</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>Chris Cairns is being cross examined by QC for Lalit Modi in libel trial over tweet accusing fmr New Zealand cricket captain of match fixing</p> <p>\u2014 Josh Halliday (@JoshHalliday) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshHalliday/status/176986003788152832\" data-datetime=\"2012-03-06T11:02:06+00:00\">March 6, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>and </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>QC for Modi alleges that Cairns \"deepened suspicion on himself\" by accepting cash payments of \u00bb100k before major tourn.

He adds it would be wrong to make journalists \"pariahs\". </p> <p>He says it would be a bureaucratic nightmare if every time a police officer was within 50 yards of a journalist, they would have to write up some sort of record.</p> <p>This is in contrast to Elizabeth Filkin, who gave evidence to the inquiry yesterday that she has recommended that officers record every meeting with journalists and restrict off-the-record briefings.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>11.10am: Condon says he was attacked in a 1998 article by former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie, who was then working for TalkSport. </p> <p>He says he remembers at the time wondering what had caused MacKenzie to write the article, but thinks it must have been his stance on leaks.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>11.09am: Condon is asked about police leaks to the media.</p> <p>He says in a force of 45,000, occasionally there may be leaks for different motivations and probably occasionally for \"financial reasons\".</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>11.07am: Condon says he had some very \"seductive offers\" either from publishers or agents and all of those would have had serialisation rights element, but these were never explored as he didn't take up any of the offers.</p> <p>He says he was offered a column with the Telegraph group, and had a limited approach from the People, which offered to \"ghost\" a column for him.</p> <p>Condon adds he doesn't remember any specific approaches from the Murdoch stable.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>11.06am: Condon is asked about the \"revolving door\" that sometimes sees police working for the media following retirement. He says he refused all offers to write an autobiography.</p> <p>\"I declined not because I saw anything morally or ethically wrong per se,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Having spent my career majoring on integrity, indepenence, being apolitical, it just seemed I would have to take decisions to be partial or be drawn into favouring one group over another.</p> <p>\"My view is there is nothing inherently wrong with that but it would have taken me out of my comfort zone.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>11.03am: Condon says he launched what he calls the \"blush test\" for his officers:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every meeting with the press that involves hospitality should be able to pass what some people have described as the blush test: would you be happy for a local politician, a neighbour, a member of your family [to be at the meeting] \u2013 does this meeting feel right?</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>11.02am: Condon says after the 1995 Nolan committee investigating cash for questions, the Met set up new guidelines for hospitality at the Met covering gifts, payment for interviews, hospitality and contacts.</p> <p>It also set up hospitality registers for the first time.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>10.54am: Party Hoskins says Condon says in his witness statement that \"Hospitality is the start of a grooming process that can lead to inappropriate or unethical behaviour.\"</p> <p>He says that inappropriate closeness with journalists can ultimately lead to criminal behaviour.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>10.53am: Condon recalls how he gave a confidential briefing on IRA terrorism and how it remained off the record.</p> <p>The Met briefed on the sort of the attack and the nature of the surveillance, which would go on for months at a stretch.</p> <p>If the editors or their reporters started to pick up information and published it, it would have been damaging to the counter-terrorism initiative.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>10.49am: Condon says his preference was that meetings were held at Scotland Yard or at the journalists' newspaper. Only on \"a small handful of occasions\" were they in a restaurant.</p> <p>Condon said former Daily Telegraph and London Evening Standard editor Max Hastings was an exception.</p> <p>\"Max Hastings as editor of the Telegraph and the Evening Standard always moaned about the quality of food at Scotland Yard and I think I weakened and I probably had lunch with Max, probably at his club,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I remember the doyen of the crime reporters, Peter Burden, I remember having a lunch with him at the end of this time when he was retiring.</p> <p>\"I remember a lunch or a dinner with an editor of the Sun, Stuart Higgins.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>10.41am: Condon says he invited all print, TV and radio editors to brief them on his planned reforms. He says he aimed to brief each of the editors once a year. </p> <p>He held about eight to 12 meetings a year with editors. He says the commissioner must be totally apolitical and without favourites in the media.</p> <p>\"No editor seems to have had more than one [meeting] a year,\" says Condon. </p> <p>This is in contrast to yesterday's evidence when the inquiry heard how the last commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, met former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis several times a year.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>10.36am: Condon is asked about how he built relationships with journalists. </p> <p>He says it had been a longstanding arrangement that the commisisoner of the day met with crime reporters. In his time, this practice \"petered out\" and meetings with the Crime Reporters' Association were no longer monthly events.</p> <p>The CRA didn't seem to be as \"tight\" or elitist as the parliamentary lobby, Condon says.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>10.35am: Condon says it was \"a sensitive issue\" to invite the media to witness the arrests. The dignity and the rights of the suspects had to be respected so the footage would not be the police in someone's bedroom at 6am in the morning, but pictures of police breaking into the premises.</p> <p>He says he would have been very angry if he had seen anything that showed the media had trespassed into private property.</p> <p>\"They [these raids] were very tightly controlled,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>10.29am: Condon gives as an example as Operation Bumblebee, the campaign to reduce domestic burglary.</p> <p>He says the Met staged events that \"captured the imagination and transferred fear from the public to the burglars\", such as making 200-300 arrests on one day. The media would be told about this and there would be dramatic footage of the raids. </p> <p>Condon would front such events through personal briefings and interviews.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>10.28am: Condon says the Met did not have a website until 1996 or 1997, and previously a small number of editors and leader writers dominated the media agenda around policing. </p> <p>The internet and social media have given the police more opportunities to communicate directly to the public, but in his era a high level of contact with the media was necessary.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>10.28am: Condon says his dealings with the media were completely different from anything he had encountered before.</p> <p>However, he tells Patry Hoskins, this did not detract from his ability to fight crime.</p> <p>\"Rightly or wrongly, the commissioner is seen as the voice of the police force,\" he adds.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>10.26am: Stevens says his professional relationship with the media became \"a significant part of my life and at times would completely dominate it\".</p> <p>He had to deal with IRA terrorism in his time as well as the royal family and the policing of London, in itself a huge job.</p> <p>\"There would be insatiable demand for the commissioner of the day to be saying things about it, to be saying things to the public,\" he adds.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>10.23am: Condon has been out of the force now for 13 years and says he is reluctant to comment on the police force currently but says he would be amazed if there wasn't a serious attitude to malpratice.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>10.21am: Condon says he was delighted to get John Stevens in has his deputy in 1998 as he was able to carry through his policy when he took over in 2000.</p> <p>One of the key planks of the strategy was detection of corruption. One of the issues identified was to research cultural issues that might act as a barrier to staff whistleblowing.</p> <p>\"Some people think its wrong to inform on their colleagues, some might be frightened to do it \u2026 What I was seeking to do was to leigitimise, to demand and to encourage, that it was the right thing to do to whistleblow.\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>10.19am: Everyone in the Met would have been in no doubt by the end of 1998 how serious it was about dealing with the issues of corruption, he says.</p> <p>The strategy document was not an \"ephemeral, quick in and out\" policy on corruption, he adds.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>10.15am: Condon says he started a campaign that eventually led to changes in regulations on police discipline.</p> <p>His anti-corruption strategy was the culmination of a number of years work \u2013 1997 and 1998 were particularly busy.</p> <p>Early in 1998 he remembers, that with warrants, the Met raided the homes of about 30 serving and retired police officers.</p> <p>He wanted before the end of 1998 to deal with the malpractice and produced a document to define the \"rules of engagement\" on corruption.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>10.12am: Patry Hoskins asks Condon about his experience of countering police corruption.</p> <p>When he was appointed as head of the Met in 1993, he was briefed on a number of corrupt officers.</p> <p>There was a hope and expectation that he would find ways of responding to this challenge.</p> <p>Condon says in any big force \"there will always be a small number of police officers who can sadly be drawn into criminal matters\".</p> <p>Police corruption linked to the media was \"not part of the briefing and at the time was not my concern,\" he says.</p> <p>He says the motivation for corruption was \"primarily financial gain\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>10.07am: Condon joined the police force in 1967, and is a former chief constable of Kent police. He was commissioner of the Met from 1993 to 2000, when he was succeeded by his deputy, Lord Stevens.</p> <p>He is an independent member of the House of Lords, and is chairman of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit. He has served on a number of commercial boards in the US and Australia.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>10.04am: <strong>Lord Condon</strong>, the former Met commissioner, will be the first witness.</p> <p>Carine Patry Hoskins, junior counsel to the inquiry, is doing the questioning.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.04am: The inquiry has now begun.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>9.57am: After leaving the Met, Condon's roles have included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/16/t20-lord-condon\">setting up the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit</a>.</p> <p>After the Pakistan match-fixing scandal, Condon said the the ICC should have the \"nuclear option\" of ultimately excluding national boards who fail to clean up the sport in their country.</p> <p>He went on to praise the News of the World for its involvement in exposing the scandal, adding:</p> <blockquote> <p>I've congratulated the News of The World because this was a sting that was done very well and I think they have done cricket a great service.</p> <p>If the ICC had done this it probably would not have got to court because rules around entrapment are complex.</p> <p>The News of The World had the freedom and courage to take this on and, although this was a huge embarrassment, it was necessary.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.48am: Good morning and welcome to the Leveson live blog. </p> <p>Today we hear from two former Met commissioners and the most senior officer at Surrey police, the force responsible for the investigation into the murder of Milly Dowler. </p> <p>The Inquiry will hear evidence from <strong>Lord Condon</strong>, <strong>Lord Stevens</strong> and <strong>Lynne Owens</strong>. </p> <p>Condon's term at the top of the Met from 1993 to 2000 has been described as \"the most traumatic six years a commissioner has faced\".

      "bodyText": "Six global powers have agreed to resume negotiations with Iran on its nuclear programme, calling for \"concrete and practical steps\" to restore international trust in Tehran's stated intentions. In a letter to Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, the EU foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton, said the negotiations should restart as soon as possible, at a venue to be decided. Writing on behalf of a negotiating group comprising the US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany, Ashton said: \"Our overall goal remains a comprehensive negotiated, long-term solution which restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme, while respecting Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy consistent with the NPT [nuclear non-proliferation treaty].\" The last set of talks broke down in Istanbul in January last year. Western diplomats said Jalili refused at that meeting to negotiate over Iran's nuclear programme or any confidence-building measures previously discussed, such as an exchange of Iranian enriched uranium for foreign-made fuel rods for the Tehran research reactor. At the meeting, the Iranian negotiator laid down pre-conditions for talks including the lifting of all sanctions and a guarantee that Iran could continue its nuclear programme, including the most controversial element, uranium enrichment. As military tensions rose in the Gulf, with growing speculation over the possibility of an Israeli attack aimed at setting back the Iranian nuclear programme, Ashton wrote to Jalili in October last year suggesting that talks be resumed, but only on condition that they focused on Iran's nuclear activities. Tehran says the programme is for purely peaceful purposes, but the west and Israel allege it is a front for an effort to build a nuclear arsenal, or at least establish the capacity to build a bomb at short notice. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told an American Jewish group in Washington on Monday that diplomacy and sanctions had failed and that \"none of us can afford to wait much longer\" to act against Tehran. Jalili's reply to Ashton was delivered in February, four months after her proposal, suggesting talks on \"a spectrum of issues\" including \"Iran's nuclear issue\". That was taken by the six-nation group as specific enough to warrant a positive response, but there were differences between the capitals over how open-ended the talks could be, with the hardest line taken by Paris. French officials argued that in order to satisfy Israel that all was being done to resolve the nuclear crisis by peaceful means, the international response would have to make it absolutely clear that the talks would have to end with the \"full implementation\" of UN security council resolutions calling for the suspension of uranium enrichment. That language was spelt out in Ashton's latest letter. \"Therefore, looking forward to a sustained process of dialogue aimed at producing concrete results and in order not to repeat the experience of Istanbul, I would propose that we resume our talks at a mutually convenient date and venue as soon as possible,\" Ashton concluded, adding that junior officials should meet in the near future to agree a time and venue. Western officials do not expect the negotiations to take place before the Iranian new year, or Nowruz, holiday. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), presented to the agency's board this week, said Iran had tripled its rate of production of 20%-enriched uranium, seen by the west as a particular proliferation threat, and reported that Iran had not co-operated with an inspection visit last month, refusing access to a sensitive military site known as Parchin. The Iranian mission to the IAEA said on Tuesday that access would be provided as long as the inspectors dealt with all their concerns about Parchin in a single visit. \"Considering the fact that it is a military site, granting access is a time-consuming process and cannot be permitted repeatedly,\" the mission said.",

      "body": "<p>Six global powers have agreed to resume negotiations with Iran on its nuclear programme, calling for \"concrete and practical steps\" to restore international trust in Tehran's stated intentions.</p> <p>In a letter to Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, the EU foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton, said the negotiations should restart as soon as possible, at a venue to be decided.</p> <p>Writing on behalf of a negotiating group comprising the US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany, Ashton said: \"Our overall goal remains a comprehensive negotiated, long-term solution which restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme, while respecting Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy consistent with the NPT [nuclear non-proliferation treaty].\"</p> <p>The last set of talks broke down in Istanbul in January last year. Western diplomats said Jalili refused at that meeting to negotiate over Iran's nuclear programme or any confidence-building measures previously discussed, such as an exchange of Iranian enriched uranium for foreign-made fuel rods for the Tehran research reactor.</p> <p>At the meeting, the Iranian negotiator laid down pre-conditions for talks including the lifting of all sanctions and a guarantee that Iran could continue its nuclear programme, including the most controversial element, uranium enrichment.</p> <p>As military tensions rose in the Gulf, with growing speculation over the possibility of an Israeli attack aimed at setting back the Iranian nuclear programme, Ashton wrote to Jalili in October last year suggesting that talks be resumed, but only on condition that they focused on Iran's nuclear activities.</p> <p>Tehran says the programme is for purely peaceful purposes, but the west and Israel allege it is a front for an effort to build a nuclear arsenal, or at least establish the capacity to build a bomb at short notice.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told an American Jewish group in Washington on Monday that diplomacy and sanctions had failed and that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/06/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-weapons-israel\" title=\"\">\"none of us can afford to wait much longer\"</a> to act against Tehran.</p> <p>Jalili's reply to Ashton was delivered in February, four months after her proposal, suggesting talks on \"a spectrum of issues\" including \"Iran's nuclear issue\". That was taken by the six-nation group as specific enough to warrant a positive response, but there were differences between the capitals over how open-ended the talks could be, with the hardest line taken by Paris.</p> <p>French officials argued that in order to satisfy Israel that all was being done to resolve the nuclear crisis by peaceful means, the international response would have to make it absolutely clear that the talks would have to end with the \"full implementation\" of UN security council resolutions calling for the suspension of uranium enrichment. That language was spelt out in Ashton's latest letter.</p> <p>\"Therefore, looking forward to a sustained process of dialogue aimed at producing concrete results and in order not to repeat the experience of Istanbul, I would propose that we resume our talks at a mutually convenient date and venue as soon as possible,\" Ashton concluded, adding that junior officials should meet in the near future to agree a time and venue. Western officials do not expect the negotiations to take place before the Iranian new year, or Nowruz, holiday.</p> <p>A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), presented to the agency's board this week, said Iran had tripled its rate of production of 20%-enriched uranium, seen by the west as a particular proliferation threat, and reported that Iran had not co-operated with an inspection visit last month, refusing access to a sensitive military site known as Parchin.</p> <p>The Iranian mission to the IAEA said on Tuesday that access would be provided as long as the inspectors dealt with all their concerns about Parchin in a single visit. \"Considering the fact that it is a military site, granting access is a time-consuming process and cannot be permitted repeatedly,\" the mission said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The pendulum of police and media relations has swung too far away from openness in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, with police officers terrified to speak to the press, Lord Stevens, the former commissioner of the Metropolitan police told the Leveson inquiry. Stevens, who as Met commissioner introduced an open-door policy for the media, said he would have picked up and \"tirelessly\" pursued the issues raised by the Guardian in 2009 about phone hacking at the News of the World. But he said the reaction to the phone-hacking revelations had created an unhealthy fear of the press among police officers. Asked by Robert Jay QC, for the inquiry, if the pendulum had swung too far, Stevens said: \"From what I have heard people are absolutely terrified of picking up the phone and speaking to the press in any way. I don't think that is healthy. The press has their job to do, they have delivered some outstanding work. There has to be a relationship with them for the right reasons.\" He said that not engaging with the press put the police at risk of not being trusted, and in turn risked causing outbreaks of rioting. \"Let me make this clear: in my view this is extremely damaging to British policing,\" he told the inquiry. \"The media need to know what the police are doing. It is absolutely essential to have transparency and openness \u2026 If there's no engagement then the police risk not being part of the community. This will ultimately result in them being distrusted.\" He added: \"It is precisely in these conditions that public order outbreaks occur as community tensions are heightened and there is public concern over the actions of the police.\" Giving evidence before him, Lord Condon, Met commissioner from 1993 to 2000, said there should not be an overly bureaucratic response to the phone-hacking revelations. \"I would be worried about anything which suggested that any contact between the police and the media was almost inherently wrong, that the media are given some sort of pariah status, and almost being in the same room, or within 50 yards of them, a police officer would be required to take a note,\" he said. But Condon suggested that hospitality from journalists was a dangerous area. \"In my opinion hospitality can be the start of a grooming process which can lead to unethical or inappropriate behaviour,\" he said. During their tenures at Scotland Yard, Stevens and Condon said they met editors from all national newspapers. Both denied favouring any particular editors. Stevens said he and his wife dined with Neil Wallis and his wife, as part of a charity project to take a convoy to Romania. Former News of the World deputy editor Wallis, who was later employed by the Met as a public relations adviser, did not eventually take part in the convoy. Stevens met former News of the World and Sun editor Rebekah Brooks 12 times in his five years in the commissioner role, and said she was concerned to push her desire to introduce Sarah's Law. Both men said their relationships with the media during their tenure were entirely \"professional\". Stevens, who wrote a column for the News of the World on his retirement from the Met police, said he resigned from it following the conviction in 2007 of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire over phone hacking. \"I saw Colin Myler and Neil Wallis and told them I didn't want to continue. I never gave them reasons but from that night on I never saw them again,\" he said. Stevens said his decision to end the contract with the paper was fuelled by other information he received around that time about \"some unethical behaviour in relation to one or two articles that had got headlines in the News of the World\". He did not elaborate. Stevens, who was commissioner of the Met police from 2000 to 2005, said whether you had a professional relationship with a member of the media or not, if evidence came to light of wrongdoing it had to be pursued. \"I would like to have thought that as commissioner I would have picked up on the issues the Guardian raised. I would have been quite tireless about pursuing them,\" he said. The former commissioner introduced a policy of openness towards the media when he was at Scotland Yard after taking over from Paul, now Lord, Condon. At the time he said the Met police was in crisis: morale was at an all-time low and recruitment was difficult, relationships with the media were poor and the force was seen as secretive and defensive. He said he was clear about the guidance officers should follow: \"Be open and honest, directly answer questions and, mostly importantly, never lie to the press.\" His philosophy, he said, was to let his frontline officers tell their stories to the media and officers of inspector rank and above were allowed to talk to the press without prior clearance. He said it was a matter of letting \"officers on the street and support staff tell their stories in a positive way\". He went on: \"I believe actions speak louder than words \u2026 it is not for the commissioner, chief constable or anyone to say their force is doing brilliantly. Let others do that.\"",

      "bodyText": "\"To try to write love is to confront the muck of language: that region of hysteria where language is both too much and too little, excessive (by the limitless expansion of the ego, by emotive submersion) and impoverished (by the codes of which love diminishes and levels it).\" \u2013 Roland Barthes. * A man stands alone in a baggy white suit, a black masquerade visor over his eyes. He is concealing a broken heart and a loudhailer \u2026 Just imagine: you have the opportunity to write one of those all-time sexiest and most heartbroken of songs. First step: you get involved with someone who drives you crazy with desire \u2013 ensnares you, mesmerises you, has you at arm's length and in the palm of their hand. Then something happens: that inevitable separation. You're classically awry \u2013 but where's the gain (or the end) in being uselessly melancholy? Write that song about it, summing up both your despair and the wonder of the love and sex that caused it in the first place. You have to choose your words carefully, carnally; you have to find a crucial metaphor. It has to be just so \u2013 to sound like you're completely drunk on love and near suicidal through the absence of your loved one. You recline on a couch and clutch your heart. The evening seems impossible: so many hours to go and no chance of the loved one appearing \u2026 The song has to read like a love letter, from miles away. You map it out, the scenario is precarious. You get dressed up to kill, take enough numbing drugs and stand alone at the peak of your metaphorical island. You whisper \u2013 the loudhailer turns it to a plea for all the world to hear \u2026 \"Off the coast of me lies you; In a waterfall of solitude. I must find a one-way passage through. To the very heart and private part of you.\" Just imagine: the song of my dreams. The August Darnell world \u2013 as manifested in a lot of Dr Buzzard's Original Savannah Band and all of Kid Creole and the Coconuts \u2013 is a looking glass world, a somewhere far away peopled by metaphors. But you don't need a map to find this island, because its mythology is built around that very real, most easily found (and lost) of places \u2013 love. Sexual love, romantic love, high life love, hedonistic love, hardship love whatever, wherever or whoever \u2026 There's a whole new lyrical country here just waiting to be discovered. It is cavalier, cinemascope and carnal. It's a subliminal carnival, a bit of a circus, a sip of a cocktail: amorous, clandestine, physical, light-headed and heavy-lidded. The dance of love \u2013 do you know the opening steps? You awful flirt! \"High heels / Straplessly red / Seedless grapes / Cozied in the bed/ Peg leg pants / Tossed aside / Scarlet smears across the bathroom tile / No, you needn't explain: / First comes the thunder, then the rain.\" Just look: there's the author. An infinitely cool and not unshifty looking character. A character somewhere between Alice's mysterious little late White Rabbit and a black market spiv, between Cab Calloway and Graham Greene, between Glenn Miller and the De Niro of New York, New York. Observe the cool. Study the deportment: the stall, the sly romantic glance up from his drink. Takes out a pocket watch from his waistcoat, on a too-long golden chain. His second hand's playing for time \u2026 * For a contemporary popular music scene \u2013 \"rock's rich tapestry,\" call it what you will \u2013 all too often devoid of true troubadours and the conveyed bliss of sexual love, Mr August Darnell is a person we scarcely seem to deserve, an unusually conscientious and industrious writer, composer, arranger, producer, player, singer, stage manager, character, bon vivant. As his sartorial projection might lead you to believe, he belongs to a different age. An age when songwriting was a craft \u2013 your profession, your pride, and often a crafty progression from the very heart and poison pen parts of your day-to-day life. August Darnell makes use of words. He savours them, seduces their meanings, makes them his own. The pimp! (Just my little metaphorical joke.) In the course of both Dr Buzzards Original Savannah Band and Kid Creole, Darnell has slyly, slowly been redesigning the content and tenor of the subject matter (the one that matters) of which so many songs are fashioned. Saying it, crooning, orienting it, jiving it, driving it, steering it like a captain in his ship. He has been most recently renowned for a widespread association with a number of acts resident in the New York Ze/Antilles label: James White and the Blacks, Cristina, The Aural Exciters, Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band and of course Kid Creole and the Coconuts. If you're a keen modern soul fan you may also have happened upon his involvement with an outfit named Machine (more on them later) and maybe even a project known as Gichy Dan's Beechwood No. 9 (too obscure even for me). But our maestro's story goes back a few years to the group (or legend) known as Dr Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, which he co-ran and all too seldom co-runs with a man named Stony Browder Jr, an even more elusive gentleman than August. The Savannah Band are best known or remembered for a mini hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1976 \u2013 Cherchez La Femme, taken off the group's first RCA album (same name as the name). Two more albums have since appeared \u2013 1978's D.B.O.S.B. Meets King Penett (RCA) and the recent James Monroe H.S. Presents D.B.O.S.B. Goes To Washington (Elektra) \u2013 the latter being their classiest and craziest yet. It would always have been easy to peg the Savannah Band as mere ritzy revivalists \u2013 a frivolous private joke, albeit a painstakingly self-referential one \u2013 a la Pointer Sisters or Manhattan Transfer. The beat goes a lot further and deeper. Just listen: the lush text of their performance is deceptively, danceably lighter on the ear. If you dip and dig around you'll find a clearer complexity \u2013 those scores sound very learned! The hook to each song is usually deep in a choppy rhythmic current \u2013 a shuffling samba. Very insistent, very dreamy. Less speed and more taste than that more popping popular amyl (night rate) disco beat. Lined and fleeced with a multiplicity of signs from a predominantly 40s Swing Era code book: seedy jazz, seething calypso, reedy rhumba, rude rhythm'n'blues. The horn section and vocal harmony arrangements are many sided and exquisitely twisted, counter-counter-pointed. What poise! What a slinky noise. Dr Buzzard's Savannah Band always have been about arrangement (so difficult to get hold of good arrangers these days, my dear) but it still all sounds informally natural. Music and lyrics travel all over the place. Benny Goodman horns highlight a Scott Fitzgerald scenario of tiffs, Tia Maria and tension \u2026 Brass band surrounds a fairground tryst \u2026 Itchy crickets chorus of percussion brings a come-down hell to life. \"You did the mambo, the cha-cha, bolero, the rhumba \u2026/ You did the tango, the conga, the disco, the samba\u2026\" The music is full of jokes, references, interruptions, homage: recreation recycled into contemporaneity. It isn't just waxwork. Stony Browder is usually credited for musical arrangements, Darnell for lyrics, but like everything else in Savannah land the accepted borderlines are smudged. While we're here, the rest of the Band besides Browder (guitar, piano) and Darnell (bass) are Ms. Cory Daye (main vocalist), Micky Sevilla (drums/ percussion) and \"Sugar Coated\" Andy Hernandez (vibes, marimba) \u2013 also a mainstay of the Coconut enterprise. Dr Buzzard's Savannah Band is a perfect marriage of music and words \u2013 it wouldn't be the same if either partner wasn't just so compatible, as sophisticated as the other. Both Browder and Darnell translate into various languages, idioms, styles. They really are good \u2013 I think Darnell is perhaps without par amongst contemporary lyricists. Early Ferry gets somewhere near to the territory (but he lost his sense of humour). Darnell knows it's not simply a question of saying what was or wasn't done to one party or the other (at one party or another) in the name of love \u2013 and how it was done; but of constructing, in and around the particular sexual mise en scene, all the bitty thoughts that recapitulated it, the obsessions that accompanied it, the decorations that surrounded it, the images, desires, modulations, and quality of the pleasure that animated it. His lyrics really begin to get sharp on the second Savannah Band album. Going beyond the fixed range of expressions we expect from our songs and singers, Darnell's lovers and losers go off into dreams, into rages, into hospital, into too many clubs and even off their heads. The stories echo Damon Runyon one moment, the Brothers Grimm the next \u2026 \"Of all the dames I fancied / She's the only one I loved. / And when she left the pavement turned to mud. / I sought refuge in a dim saloon, / But I would have drowned in booze, / If it weren't for the troubadour.\" Chorus: \"Restless lovers everywhere / Dry your eyes, pull up a chair / Spill the cup and cup the ear / For the organ grinder's tale\u2026\" The pictures switch from an exaggerated ball \u2013 \"When Crosby starts to croon / The jitterbuggies cruise the room / Their fingers poke the air / Man-o-man-o-man-o-man, they look just like that Fred Astaire! / \"Swing it with me, my Mattie Mario\" / No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm saving this fling for Mister Love.\" \u2013 to obscure outbreaks of gang hatred \u2013 \"Soraya, bring big gun / And let's have some bloody fun / Nignats do the Rats in \u2013 / Kunta and grimel don't mix / Like creme et cocoa.\" Various characters and symbols \u2013 some figurative, some actual \u2013 make a recurrent entrance into the play of Savannah Band language, as the mad covers to all their albums testify. Wouldn't you just love to visit The New Syringe Club? Mambo Eddie's Beatnix School? And finish off at The New York At Dawn Show? During the course of the evening you might learn that both Stony Browder and August Darnell attended the James Monroe High School, that the Tommy Mottola of Cherchez La Femme really was their manager, and couldn't fail to be convinced that the Savannah Band really are Champions of the Romantic. Darnell is also a champion of the untold story, the surreptitious and strictly confidential. But unlike so many \"songwriters\" who are respected for their \"honesty\" about \"relationships\" \u2013 who write songs which convey nothing but venom and connivance \u2013 Darnell never loses his humour or humanity. He can fall from ecstasy to squalor in one coded coda. No one is producing better mnemonics for nightlife \u2013 even Chic got left behind a while back. \"Tired smiles / Censored romance / Premature sighs \u2013 / Now it all makes sense. / Trolley car /Take me along / To some distant shore far from Babylon. / For their air here reeks of lies; / And even the robins sound warlike. / Nocturnal interludes / Like so many tsetse flies / Nocturnal interludes / Damaging merchandise / Make-me-believe-it solitude.\" * ZE Records' New York Office is housed on one floor of a big building which also contains the Carnegie Hall Recital rooms. You can get stuck in the same lift as Harvey Keitel did in a movie called Fingers. Except that now they've got a lift-man. I sat down opposite August Darnell in the traditional false comfort of a record company \"hospitality\" room. I should have specified a bar in advance. Also in the room are a couple of Coconuts (Andy Hernandez \u2013 who asks me more questions than I ask anyone \u2013 and \"Mister Piano\" Peter Scott, the youngest member of the ensemble, who says virtually nothing throughout) and a varying number of people from both the band entourage and ZE. Darnell is wearing a moderately baggy, immaculately tailored creamy white suit, and everything else seems to match, natch. He twirls a tiny pink parasol (decoration pinched off a birthday cake) between thumb and forefinger, and answers all queries in a very businesslike but charming manner. \u2022 To read Penman's interview with Kid Creole, visit Rock's Backpages.",

He is concealing a broken heart and a loudhailer \u2026</p> <p>Just imagine: you have the opportunity to write one of those all-time sexiest and most heartbroken of songs. First step: you get involved with someone who drives you crazy with desire \u2013 ensnares you, mesmerises you, has you at arm's length and in the palm of their hand. Then something happens: that inevitable separation. You're classically awry \u2013 but where's the gain (or the end) in being uselessly melancholy?</p> <p>Write that song about it, summing up both your despair and the wonder of the love and sex that caused it in the first place.</p> <p>You have to choose your words carefully, carnally; you have to find a crucial metaphor. It has to be just so \u2013 to sound like you're completely drunk on love and near suicidal through the absence of your loved one. You recline on a couch and clutch your heart. The evening seems impossible: so many hours to go and no chance of the loved one appearing \u2026</p> <p>The song has to read like a love letter, from miles away. You map it out, the scenario is precarious. You get dressed up to kill, take enough numbing drugs and stand alone at the peak of your metaphorical island. You whisper \u2013 the loudhailer turns it to a plea for all the world to hear \u2026</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Off the coast of me lies you;<br>In a waterfall of solitude.<br>I must find a one-way passage through.<br>To the very heart and private part of you.\"<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Just imagine: the song of my dreams.</p> <p>The August Darnell world \u2013 as manifested in a lot of Dr Buzzard's Original Savannah Band and all of Kid Creole and the Coconuts \u2013 is a looking glass world, a somewhere far away peopled by metaphors. But you don't need a map to find this island, because its mythology is built around that very real, most easily found (and lost) of places \u2013 love. Sexual love, romantic love, high life love, hedonistic love, hardship love whatever, wherever or whoever \u2026</p> <p>There's a whole new lyrical country here just waiting to be discovered. It is cavalier, cinemascope and carnal. It's a subliminal carnival, a bit of a circus, a sip of a cocktail: amorous, clandestine, physical, light-headed and heavy-lidded. The dance of love \u2013 do you know the opening steps? You awful flirt!</p> <p>\"High heels / Straplessly red / Seedless grapes / Cozied in the bed/ Peg leg pants / Tossed aside / Scarlet smears across the bathroom tile / No, you needn't explain: / First comes the thunder, then the rain.\"</p> <p>Just look: there's the author. An infinitely cool and not unshifty looking character. A character somewhere between Alice's mysterious little late White Rabbit and a black market spiv, between Cab Calloway and Graham Greene, between Glenn Miller and the De Niro of New York, New York. Observe the cool. Study the deportment: the stall, the sly romantic glance up from his drink. Takes out a pocket watch from his waistcoat, on a too-long golden chain. His second hand's playing for time \u2026</p> <p>*</p> <p>For a contemporary popular music scene \u2013 \"rock's rich tapestry,\" call it what you will \u2013 all too often devoid of true troubadours and the conveyed bliss of sexual love, Mr August Darnell is a person we scarcely seem to deserve, an unusually conscientious and industrious writer, composer, arranger, producer, player, singer, stage manager, character, bon vivant. As his sartorial projection might lead you to believe, he belongs to a different age. An age when songwriting was a craft \u2013 your profession, your pride, and often a crafty progression from the very heart and poison pen parts of your day-to-day life.</p> <p>August Darnell makes use of words. He savours them, seduces their meanings, makes them his own. The pimp! (Just my little metaphorical joke.) In the course of both Dr Buzzards Original Savannah Band and Kid Creole, Darnell has slyly, slowly been redesigning the content and tenor of the subject matter (the one that matters) of which so many songs are fashioned. Saying it, crooning, orienting it, jiving it, driving it, steering it like a captain in his ship.</p> <p>He has been most recently renowned for a widespread association with a number of acts resident in the New York Ze/Antilles label: James White and the Blacks, Cristina, The Aural Exciters, Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band and of course Kid Creole and the Coconuts. If you're a keen modern soul fan you may also have happened upon his involvement with an outfit named Machine (more on them later) and maybe even a project known as Gichy Dan's Beechwood No. 9 (too obscure even for me).</p> <p>But our maestro's story goes back a few years to the group (or legend) known as Dr Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, which he co-ran and all too seldom co-runs with a man named Stony Browder Jr, an even more elusive gentleman than August. The Savannah Band are best known or remembered for a mini hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1976 \u2013 Cherchez La Femme, taken off the group's first RCA album (same name as the name). Two more albums have since appeared \u2013 1978's D.B.O.S.B. Meets King Penett (RCA) and the recent James Monroe H.S. Presents D.B.O.S.B. Goes To Washington (Elektra) \u2013 the latter being their classiest and craziest yet.</p> <p>It would always have been easy to peg the Savannah Band as mere ritzy revivalists \u2013 a frivolous private joke, albeit a painstakingly self-referential one \u2013 a la Pointer Sisters or Manhattan Transfer. The beat goes a lot further and deeper. Just listen: the lush text of their performance is deceptively, danceably lighter on the ear. If you dip and dig around you'll find a clearer complexity \u2013 those scores sound very learned!</p> <p>The hook to each song is usually deep in a choppy rhythmic current \u2013 a shuffling samba. Very insistent, very dreamy. Less speed and more taste than that more popping popular amyl (night rate) disco beat. Lined and fleeced with a multiplicity of signs from a predominantly 40s Swing Era code book: seedy jazz, seething calypso, reedy rhumba, rude rhythm'n'blues. The horn section and vocal harmony arrangements are many sided and exquisitely twisted, counter-counter-pointed. What poise! What a slinky noise.</p> <p>Dr Buzzard's Savannah Band always have been about arrangement (so difficult to get hold of good arrangers these days, my dear) but it still all sounds informally natural.</p> <p>Music and lyrics travel all over the place. Benny Goodman horns highlight a Scott Fitzgerald scenario of tiffs, Tia Maria and tension \u2026 Brass band surrounds a fairground tryst \u2026 Itchy crickets chorus of percussion brings a come-down hell to life.</p> <p>\"You did the mambo, the cha-cha, bolero, the rhumba \u2026/ You did the tango, the conga, the disco, the samba\u2026\"</p> <p>The music is full of jokes, references, interruptions, homage: recreation recycled into contemporaneity. It isn't just waxwork. Stony Browder is usually credited for musical arrangements, Darnell for lyrics, but like everything else in Savannah land the accepted borderlines are smudged. While we're here, the rest of the Band besides Browder (guitar, piano) and Darnell (bass) are Ms. Cory Daye (main vocalist), Micky Sevilla (drums/ percussion) and \"Sugar Coated\" Andy Hernandez (vibes, marimba) \u2013 also a mainstay of the Coconut enterprise.</p> <p>Dr Buzzard's Savannah Band is a perfect marriage of music and words \u2013 it wouldn't be the same if either partner wasn't just so compatible, as sophisticated as the other. Both Browder and Darnell translate into various languages, idioms, styles. They really are good \u2013 I think Darnell is perhaps without par amongst contemporary lyricists. Early Ferry gets somewhere near to the territory (but he lost his sense of humour).</p> <p>Darnell knows it's not simply a question of saying what was or wasn't done to one party or the other (at one party or another) in the name of love \u2013 and how it was done; but of constructing, in and around the particular sexual mise en scene, all the bitty thoughts that recapitulated it, the obsessions that accompanied it, the decorations that surrounded it, the images, desires, modulations, and quality of the pleasure that animated it.</p> <p>His lyrics really begin to get sharp on the second Savannah Band album. Going beyond the fixed range of expressions we expect from our songs and singers, Darnell's lovers and losers go off into dreams, into rages, into hospital, into too many clubs and even off their heads. The stories echo Damon Runyon one moment, the Brothers Grimm the next \u2026</p> <p>\"Of all the dames I fancied / She's the only one I loved. / And when she left the pavement turned to mud. / I sought refuge in a dim saloon, / But I would have drowned in booze, / If it weren't for the troubadour.\"</p> <p>Chorus: \"Restless lovers everywhere / Dry your eyes, pull up a chair / Spill the cup and cup the ear / For the organ grinder's tale\u2026\"</p> <p>The pictures switch from an exaggerated ball \u2013 \"When Crosby starts to croon / The jitterbuggies cruise the room / Their fingers poke the air / Man-o-man-o-man-o-man, they look just like that Fred Astaire! / \"Swing it with me, my Mattie Mario\" / No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm saving this fling for Mister Love.\" \u2013 to obscure outbreaks of gang hatred \u2013 \"Soraya, bring big gun / And let's have some bloody fun / Nignats do the Rats in \u2013 / Kunta and grimel don't mix / Like creme et cocoa.\"</p> <p>Various characters and symbols \u2013 some figurative, some actual \u2013 make a recurrent entrance into the play of Savannah Band language, as the mad covers to all their albums testify. Wouldn't you just love to visit The New Syringe Club? Mambo Eddie's Beatnix School? And finish off at The New York At Dawn Show? During the course of the evening you might learn that both Stony Browder and August Darnell attended the James Monroe High School, that the Tommy Mottola of Cherchez La Femme really was their manager, and couldn't fail to be convinced that the Savannah Band really are Champions of the Romantic.</p> <p>Darnell is also a champion of the untold story, the surreptitious and strictly confidential. But unlike so many \"songwriters\" who are respected for their \"honesty\" about \"relationships\" \u2013 who write songs which convey nothing but venom and connivance \u2013 Darnell never loses his humour or humanity. He can fall from ecstasy to squalor in one coded coda. No one is producing better mnemonics for nightlife \u2013 even Chic got left behind a while back.</p> <p>\"Tired smiles / Censored romance / Premature sighs \u2013 / Now it all makes sense. / Trolley car /Take me along / To some distant shore far from Babylon. / For their air here reeks of lies; / And even the robins sound warlike. / Nocturnal interludes / Like so many tsetse flies / Nocturnal interludes / Damaging merchandise / Make-me-believe-it solitude.\"</p> <p>*</p> <p>ZE Records' New York Office is housed on one floor of a big building which also contains the Carnegie Hall Recital rooms. You can get stuck in the same lift as Harvey Keitel did in a movie called Fingers. Except that now they've got a lift-man.</p> <p>I sat down opposite August Darnell in the traditional false comfort of a record company \"hospitality\" room. I should have specified a bar in advance.</p> <p>Also in the room are a couple of Coconuts (Andy Hernandez \u2013 who asks me more questions than I ask anyone \u2013 and \"Mister Piano\" Peter Scott, the youngest member of the ensemble, who says virtually nothing throughout) and a varying number of people from both the band entourage and ZE.</p> <p>Darnell is wearing a moderately baggy, immaculately tailored creamy white suit, and everything else seems to match, natch. He twirls a tiny pink parasol (decoration pinched off a birthday cake) between thumb and forefinger, and answers all queries in a very businesslike but charming manner.</p> <p>\u2022 To read Penman's interview with Kid Creole, visit <a href=\"http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=10725\" title=\"\">Rock's Backpages</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This is an experimental blog exploring new ways to make a complex issue accessible to complete outsiders. The complex issue here is finance. This blog started in the summer of 2011 and officially launched on 15 September of that year. As the blog's author I began at zero, meaning I knew as little about finance as any other outsider. Since then each time I learn or discover something new, it goes on this blog and periodically I write wrap-up pieces surveying surprises, \"light bulb moments\" and larger lessons. At TEDxAmsterdam 2011, I gave a talk called Sharing Your Learning Curve, on the thinking behind documenting one's journey from complete outsider to eventually something of an insider. By now the blog features more than 40 interviews with finance professionals in London, as well as three wrap-up pieces; the article surveying the first 10 interviews is the second most-read piece on the blog. The most popular wrap-up is the one about what it's like to be a woman in finance \u2013 based on a dozen interviews with female professionals in finance. Most recent is the one which, after about 35 interviews, looks at why finance has so few whistleblowers. Though the wrap-up articles probably give you best value for time in terms of quick insights, I would definitely recommend dipping into a few of the interviews, just to get a flavour of how people in finance see themselves. You can find these Voices of Finance here, but bear in mind that if you work in finance you can lose your job for talking to the press, so there can't be any names or identifiable details. More importantly, this is not a random sample. Around one third of the interviewees comes from my extended network of colleagues and acquaintances, the rest volunteered through this blog's email address: jlbankingblog@gmail.com. I would ask each of them: what is a typical working day for you and why? Then we'd talk about whatever came up. Personally, I love all my interviewees in equal measure, of course. But if I came to the world of finance for the first time, these are the five articles that I would have wanted to read most. 1. I will never look at people in finance in the same way since I know that they have zero job security. They can literally get a phone call and be marched out of the building by security five minutes later. This interviewee is tasked with firing bankers. An astonishing testimony. 2. I never realised the extent to which information technology is changing finance. Trading has become an almost completely different job from only 20 years ago. But that's nothing compared with so-called high-frequency trading (HFT). This is a profoundly frightening stuff. If you haven't heard of this yet, you want to read this interview with a programmer at an HFT hedge fund. There's also a follow-up interview where he replies to readers' often very angry questions and comments. 3. If I have taken away one thing from the interviews so far, it is how large and hugely diverse the world of finance is. It makes little sense to talk about \"the bankers\" when so much in finance happens outside the banks, and when no two banks are the same. Next are two interviews with professionals demonstrating this diversity; the first works in project finance banking, where she gets roads, oil rigs and hospitals financed: \"Who has the boring job here?\" 4. The second of these interviews is with a woman working for a venture capital firm; smaller operations companies that seek out promising companies and try to grow them rapidly by investing money and expertise. Her job is fascinating, as is her personality. This is not someone afraid to speak out: \"Some people need to see that you have made a pact with the devil, compromised something. They want me to be one of those lonely career women.\" 5. Finance is more than banking, and banking breaks into very different activities. Media attention usually goes to investment banking, the areas to do with deal-making and financial markets where some people make huge bonuses. Many of the interviewees in investment banking talk about extreme working hours and an almost complete subjugation to their bank's demands. This fifth interview is with a young investment banker who quit because he felt he was losing himself. I have had many conversations about the sacrifices necessary for a career in investment banking, but none as powerful as this one. Here are five league tables for this blog, laying out how outsiders, like you, rated the interviews. Interestingly, Twitter users recommend very different interviews from those on Facebook. And the most-read interview isn't even in the top five of those most commented upon. One more thing: among the most popular posts are two interviews in a rather controversial sub-category. These are two voices on, rather than of, finance; people who are not in the industry but who have a special perspective on it, in this case because they are in a relationship with a banker, or were in one. Please do keep in mind that both the banker's ex-girlfriend and the banker's wife are just two pieces in a growing mosaic.

      "bodyText": "Millions of customers who were sold payment protection insurance are to receive letters from their lenders explaining that their policies may have been mis-sold and telling them how to make a claim \u2013 an exercise the City regulator cost the banks billions of pounds. Over the next year letters will be sent to between four million and 12 million customers who bought the insurance, usually alongside loans and credit cards, to tell them they may be able to claim to have their premiums refunded. This is because exclusions on the policies, which are supposed to pay out in the event that redundancy or sickness prevented them from working, meant they were not able to claim. In 2011, customers received more than \u00a31.9bn in compensation for mis-sold policies, and the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), said payouts prompted by these letters \"may well exceed\" what has been paid out so far. The FSA has issued guidelines on what the letters must include, and is now consulting on these with banks. The guidance states that the letters should be clear and fair, and free from financial jargon and marketing material. They must: \u2022 make it clear that the letter contains important information and should be read carefully; \u2022 say that the customer may have been mis-sold insurance and outline the specific failings that lead the firm to believe this may be the case; \u2022 say that the customer may have suffered a financial loss and could be entitled to redress; \u2022 make it clear that the letter requires careful and immediate consideration and there is a time limit for making a complaint. The FSA said that historically, response rates to this type of exercise were low, with sometimes only one in 10 consumers responding. It urged customers who did receive a letter to consider their options carefully. The watchdog's managing director, Martin Wheatley, said: \"So far the majority of payouts have been for complaints received before, or put on hold during, the judicial review. However, we are now beginning to see firms considering how to treat customers who were mis-sold but have not complained. \"We think that the redress due from this process may well exceed what has been paid so far, and that is why we are acting now to clarify our expectations. By ensuring that firms are clear about the problems they have identified and the potential redress due, we are aiming to prevent people running out of time if they choose to complain.\" The letters are part of a process being undertaken by PPI firms to establish what caused the large number of complaints; this is called \"root cause analysis\". Normally, customers have six years from a sale to complain or, if later, three years from when they became aware (or ought to have become aware) that they had cause for complaint. These deadlines will be outlined in the letters. A joint statement from the British Bankers' Association and the Association of Finance Brokers (AFB) welcomed the FSA's guidance consultation and promised that customers can expect \"clear communication\" on PPI. The statement said: \"A number of our member firms are likely to send targeted letters to some PPI customers over the coming months. \"These letters bring specific, potential problems with the product \u2013 that the firms have themselves identified \u2013 to customers' attention, inviting recipients to respond.\"",

The key is an idea that starts off in once space then goes through others. With the NSPCC, what started off as something in social media and then through to PR and then went on to support what they did through advertising, so it just snowballed. That's what we're trying to explore - what is great communication now? It's not just about briefing an agency and saying 'we need a TV ad', it's about saying 'this is the problem, this is what we're trying to achieve' and then coming up an idea and then that idea needs to work through different channels. You've got to start with a notion of open creativity. What some types of marketing tend to be held back by is the thought that you have an agency, client or brand owner that thinks 'I need an ad', then once that ad's done we'll try to figure out how we execute that in stores, then the direct mail pack, loyalty, the different channels. They're going about it the wrong way. The standout case study is the NSPCC campaign run by Livity, it just shows the power of a great idea. It was something that started off in social media that could go through many different channels and it shows what a massive impact it had on their organisation. It picked up three awards including 'Best of the Best' and people will be able to come and read what it's all about and what it achieved. What all the winners have in common is identifying the business problem, the consumer target market and what channels that audience touches.

      "bodyText": "One of my favourite pastimes is making a meal with my family. The kitchen is typically a place of warmth and good memories, but what I've recently learned about kitchens in many countries around the world has moved me to take action. As the world unites to celebrate International Women's Day this week, I am thinking of the woman who risks her life through the simple act of cooking. In fact, preparing a meal for herself and her family can be one of the most dangerous activities that a woman does. Alarmingly, nearly 3 billion people still rely on solid fuels to cook their food each day. When burned in open fires and inefficient cookstoves, fuels such as wood, coal, charcoal and animal waste create a toxic smoke that fills homes and communities the world over. Two million people die annually from pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and heart disease caused by cookstove smoke, and millions more suffer from these ailments for years, as well as from injuries such as cataracts and burns. Women are predominantly the household cooks in most countries, and with their children swaddled to their backs or at their side as they cook, the entire family becomes victim to this silent killer. Before they can even begin cooking, however, women will likely have spent hours searching for wood and other fuel sources. Children often accompany their mother on this journey, which keeps them from attending school or earning an income. Such a nurturing act as cooking should not put lives at risk. There are effective solutions, which can save lives, improve livelihoods, empower women and combat climate change. That is precisely why the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves was created. Launched by the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and hosted by the United Nations Foundation, the alliance and its hundreds of partners across the world believe that cooking shouldn't kill. It is under this remit that the alliance hopes to shape a robust market for clean cookstoves and fuels \u2013 a market that begins and ends with the needs of women. Their involvement can include providing input on stove design, owning a cookstove business, and training other women on new stove and fuel technologies. Clean cookstoves can have a transformative impact on women, as well as on their families, their communities and their environment. The numerous benefits include better health, increased safety, reduced poverty, cleaner air, and a more sustainable environment. That's why I am helping the alliance promote the adoption of 100 million clean cookstoves by 2020, inspired by the possibilities that lie ahead for women and their families once the smoke clears. \u2022 Julia Roberts serves as the global ambassador of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.",

      "bodyText": "When 16-year-old Stephanie Willis visits Ivy Gunn, who is 70 years her senior, they spend their time on simple pleasures. The teenager paints the pensioner's nails, or they look at pictures together. But for Ivy's husband Mike, 79, these short visits are a lifeline. For Ivy has dementia, and the time volunteered by Willis gives him a break from round-the-clock caring. \"Ivy's face lights up when Steph comes in,\" he says. \"For me, it's just a relief to have someone else with her who I can trust \u2013 I can slide off and know she's OK.\" For the youngster, who is hoping to become a doctor, giving up a couple of hours every week to help the Gunns in their home in St Albans, Hertfordshire, has been a rewarding experience. \"It's just a little bit of my time but I know it makes a lot of difference to them,\" she says. \"It feels like I'm giving something back to the community, but it's not just about helping them \u2013 I feel like I am developing my own skills as well. It's great that I can decide how much time to give and when it fits in with my school work.\" The Gunns and their young volunteer \"sitter\" are among the first users of one of the initiatives that ministers hope will encourage many more people to give up their time for free to help others. They book their time together using a computer system that's just won a slice of a new \u00a310m fund to boost volunteering and charitable giving. The Slivers-of-Time model allows volunteers to upload details of any free hours they mayhave, while clients can use their computer to book slots of a carer's time to suit them. Wingham Rowan, director of the social business Slivers-of-Time that developed the system, compares the convenience of this type of \"self-management\" of volunteering to online shopping. \"Anyone who can offer services to their community, or needs services from their community, should be able to book them with all the speed, control and immediacy that anyone buying a book on Amazon takes for granted,\" he says. \"Community transactions need the kind of 21st-century tools that consumers now take for granted to be in place for those who can use them.\" He adds that with two-thirds of the population already having used some sort of website for buying groceries or booking holidays, the main barrier to take-up is not the response from the public, but the willingness of voluntary organisations to adapt. \"It requires organisations to simply vet and set controls around people who have registered online, then set them free to make their own day-to-day arrangements.\" Slivers-of-Time was originally developed as a way to match employers with potential employees who needed flexible hours. On top of some 48,000 who signed up for paid work, more than 2,000 volunteers and time-bankers who swap free services are already using the online model. But now, thanks to a \u00a3150,000 grant from the \u00a310m Innovation in Giving Fund from Nesta, the system is being scaled up, with funding going into partnerships in the London borough of Newham, Bristol, and Hertfordshire, where the fire and rescue service plans to also use the online booking system to manage its volunteer rota. But can going online really boost volunteering, which last year fell to a 10-year low? Nesta certainly believes so. It says ideas like Slivers-of-Time could help encourage higher participation across the country. \"In just a few months, we've already found ideas that have the potential for national impact and which together could make the UK an even more generous country and a world leader in the field,\" says Philip Colligan, executive director of Nesta's Public Services Lab. Such is the potential of online volunteering for caring that next month the Young Foundation is launching a venture, Care4care, that builds on the Slivers-of-Time concept to allow people to \"bank\" each hour they volunteer and draw on it when they or their family members need care. On the ground, the early signs of Slivers-of-Time are positive. Hertfordshire county council's Breakaway for Carers service, which has 55 volunteers and 101 clients registered, says would-be volunteers now know that they only need to give up time when they can. \"It has helped because we can tell people they can give the time they want when they want to,\" says Breakaway manager April Parrott. \"And the carers like it too. At first I thought we'd struggle to get people online because of the amount of older people we have but I have been surprised by the number who choose to use it.\" As more volunteers are attracted by the flexible approach, more carers can be given a break. \"The costs of running a service like this are minimal compared with the benefits of keeping 100 or so clients in their home, even for just six months longer,\" says Parrott. One of those who, like the Gunns, has taken to the online approach is Jeanette Grenby. She says booking a volunteer sitter online has \"made the most fantastic difference\" to her life. She cares for her 77-year-old husband Trevor, who has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. \"I use it on an ad hoc basis if I want to go to the hairdresser or go out in the evening,\" she says. \"I can book some time on the computer and get out of the house and stop thinking about Trevor for a few hours \u2013 the alternative is being imprisoned here.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Scottish edition of the Sun on Sunday shed almost 50,000 sales on the weekend, forcing Rupert Murdoch's launch to relinquish the title of Scotland's biggest-selling newspaper after just one week. News International's Scottish edition of the new Sunday version of the Sun sold more than 320,000 copies on its launch on 26 February. The sales figure, which put it more than 10,000 copies ahead of the longtime market leader, the Trinity Mirror-owned Sunday Mail, prompted a full-page story in the Scottish Sun on 28 February exclaiming \"No 1 Sunday\". Featuring testimonials from buyers praising the title for, among other things, its support for the SNP, the article said that the Scottish Sun outsold its \"so-called rival\" to be the top-selling paper in Scotland. However, according to unofficial sales estimates the Sunday edition of the Scottish Sun recorded a fall in sales of about 15% to about 275,000 mark on its second outing at the weekend. Overall the Sun on Sunday is estimated to have sold about 2.6m copies across the UK for its second edition at the weekend, down 17% to 19% week on week, or about 550,000 to 600,000. However, the paper remains the biggest-selling Sunday title and several of its rivals continued take a significant circulation hit. Trinity Mirror rival the Sunday Mail is thought to have improved its position week on week by more than 5,000 copies to reclaim the mantle of top-selling Scottish newspaper with sales of 316,000, according to unofficial estimates. The Sunday Mail maintained a price cut from \u00a31.30 to 50p in the north of Scotland and Tay regions for the second week running. News International has backed the launch of the newspaper with a multimillion-pound marketing campaign, which includes a controversial tie-up with Scottish broadcaster STV and a cut price of 50p. The Sunday Mail has traditionally been the market leader in Scotland, reporting a total circulation of 360,475 in June last year, the last full month the News of the World reported audited sales figures, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Of those 329,237 copies were sold in Scotland, compared with 241,600 for the News of the World. The most recent Audit Bureau of Circulations figures for January show that the Sunday Mail has a circulation of 370,355, a 1.4% month-on-month rise and 1.1% year-on-year sales increase, of which 357,724 were in Scotland. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "A German clothing company favoured by far-right extremists has provoked outrage after allegedly naming its newest branch after the self-confessed Norwegian mass murderer who killed 77 people last summer. Thor Steinar, which models itself as a Nordic company and uses the Norwegian flag, has named its shop in the eastern city of Chemnitz as \"Brevik\" \u2013 a name whose similarity to Anders Behring Breivik is too close for coincidence, critics say. The name Brevik hangs prominently in the window of its central store flanked by Norwegian flags. Breivik, who has been remanded in custody since the killings last summer, has become a hero among neo-Nazis. The company, which is registered in Dubai said the shop had been named after a Norwegian community called Brevik, which lies south-east of Oslo. Politicians and citizens' groups in Chemnitz are campaigning to have the shop closed down. Katja Uhlemann, a spokeswoman for Chemnitz council, told Die Welt: \"We've already been in touch with the landlord and will take every other necessary step to ensure this shop is closed down as soon as possible.\" Sensitivities remain high because Chemnitz is the third-largest city in Saxony, whose state government has been accused of not doing enough to halt the rise of far-right extremism since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In November, a neo-Nazi terror cell, which had killed 10 people and planted nail bombs, was found to have remained at large in nearby Zwickau for 13 years. Thor Steinar, which markets itself as an outdoor clothing company and has at least 12 stores in Germany, has become a popular label among neo-Nazis. Clothing from the label is banned from being worn in the German Bundestag. The Norwegian government has sought to ban it from using the Norwegian flag in its logo.",

      "bodyText": "There can be no doubt that women are under-represented in theatre. Research by Sphinx (a theatre company which \"places women centre stage\") suggests that in 2010 only 17% of the plays performed across the UK were by female playwrights, and only 35% of actors and 23% of directors were women. Add to that a dearth of roles for older women, a lack of women in the top jobs and a tendency for funders to concentrate on other under-represented groups, and we have a problem. Yes, men have been writing plays longer than women. Yes, we need to support ethnic minorities and disabled people to make work \u2013 and it is right that arts councils across the UK should support this. However, as Sue Parrish, artistic director of Sphinx, says: \"Osmosis and natural selection will not work without intervention and support.\" Director Thomas Hescott points out \"how many high powered women there are in commercial theatre. Kim Poster and Nica Burns (who owns half of Shaftesbury Avenue), Sonia Friedman, Rosemary Squire and Sally Greene... the commercial sector seems to be dominated by women at the top.\" However, in contrast, young director Tess Seddon makes an interesting point about perceptions: \"When I turned up to work in a dress, I didn't get asked to do anything, but as soon as I turned up in jeans, trainers, no make-up, I was given interesting, challenging things to do. My rule now is that I'll never direct in a skirt.\" Women are increasingly forming their own companies and getting on with the business of making theatre. But are female-only companies empowering, or do they risk ghettoising women? Do they create opportunities, or are they being used as a get-out clause for other theatres and companies to ignore a problem? \"I think setting up an all-female company can be empowering,\" says Parrish. \"But I don't think it is a long term answer. The arts establishment assumes and believes that women's underrepresentation in the arts has been addressed.\" Lucy Perman, executive director of Clean Break, a theatre company that works with women affected by the criminal justice system, is frank: \"The fact that we're still talking about it means that there's still a problem. There is a place for all-women companies. There are no glass ceilings in all-women theatre companies, and when women move into the main theatre world they have more chance of competing with men.\" New company Agent160 wants to move away from this idea of competition, and is dedicated to putting on work by female playwrights. Although it is led by women, it also employs Dan Baker, a man, as its producer. Baker has no doubt there is a problem but hopes that his company can contribute to solving it. \"Women seem to be low down the equality agenda,\" he says. \"We talk to lots of people who perceive that there is an issue, but there is not much debate about how we actually address it. Women should not be a marginal group.\" Morrison agrees, of course, and emphasises that \"the onus has to be on men as well as women \u2013 if you're not holding the power, it is difficult to affect that change. Women are working together to create that change, but it needs active and strong dialogue with men and others who hold power. It's a collective responsibility, and women-led theatre companies are only part of the picture.\" Daisy Orton, co-director of Accidental Collective, says women \"still have to shout louder to be heard\". Her company works in a very collaborative way, meaning that although she is interested in work which is about women and their concerns, she questions whether it has to be, or should be, made by female-only companies: \"That would feel an old-fashioned way of making theatre to me.\" Is there a danger that all-female companies become a way for directors, literary managers, funders and the like to assume the underrepresentation of women is no longer their problem? Baker agrees that there's a risk. \"For Agent160 it's about the quality of work more than anything else,\" he says. \"We don't want to be 'that company that puts on plays about women's issues' and get pigeonholed into that identity. We want people to say it's good work, not 'it's work by female writers \u2013 what does that mean to me?' It's about letting the writers write about what they want to. The best thing is for women to make good work, and for it to be respected as good work, without them having to bang the drum for other women in the arts.\" Concerns have also been raised that all-female companies can become a self-inflicted form of marginalisation, where the work is always viewed on political rather than artistic terms. Rachel Barnett, co-artistic director of Peut-\u00eatre theatre company, says: \"My worry is about working within my ghetto \u2013 I would hate to be thought of as a 'female playwright', I'm a person! It's the same thing as being judged by race: I would hate to work in a Jewish theatre company just because I'm Jewish, or in a female-led company just because I'm a woman, but if one of them wanted to put on my play then that'd be great.\" On self-marginalisation, Baker says: \"There is a sense of marginalising further by becoming political about things. The work needs to speak for itself. There's a danger that companies and individuals, female artists and female-led companies, will inadvertently fall into a trap of trying to become representative of a whole group, or a whole gender. Take Josie Rourke at Donmar, for example; her work is differently examined because she's a woman.\" Baker is clear that there is a problem with ongoing support and development. \"In the past 20 years, there have been a number of female writers who have emerged and then not continued to create work and be supported. There are a lot of writers who have exploded onto the scene and then not been seen any more. I'm delving into generalisations, but perception is a big challenge. Agent160 wants to challenge the perception that female writers won't be seen as much and will be supported less.\" Eleanor Turney is a freelance writer, editor and proofreader currently working for The Poetry Society and Edinburgh's C venues \u2013 follow her on Twitter @eleanorturney This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "Newspapers, websites and internet service providers will have to be much more vigilant about sectarian hate messages now a new law has come into force in Scotland. The vigilance that publishers will have to show to weed out such messages may leave them open to defamation actions because they will be forced by the new law to deny themselves a very important defence. The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act was brought in to crack down on sectarian songs, chants and abuse at football matches, but also applies to such messages posted on the net. It came into force on 1 March and there is concern in the media in Scotland, and further afield, about how they are to comply with the law on communications. Scottish minister for community safety and legal affairs, Roseanna Cunningham, said: \"We listened to Scotland's police and prosecutors when they told us they needed greater powers to take a hard line on sectarianism at football and threats of harm being posted on the internet. These new laws make it very clear that religious hatred will no longer be tolerated and there should be no mistake that those who promote sectarianism will feel the full force of the law.\" Jock Brown, a consultant at the law firm Brodies, said: \"I am saying to people that there needs to be much more scrutiny. \"I think in the first instance the crown will be interested in the authors of the material. But if it's lying there for a while and it says something offensive then I think they will come after the publishers.\" Brown said a delay in removal of offensive material of as little as 24 hours could get a publisher into trouble, but how strict an attitude the crown takes will be shown in the cases they bring in the coming weeks and months. The act also applies to people or organisations based outside Scotland, as Brown explained: \"For instance Celtic and Rangers have a lot of fans in Dublin and Belfast and if one of them commits an offence before the travel to a game, or on the ferry over, they can be prosecuted here.\" The law would also apply to Twitter and Facebook if they allowed offensive material to remain on their sites, as it would to any publishers based in England. The practicalities of getting them into a Scottish court might be more onerous, but nonetheless the threat is there and it would not be the first time that an English publisher has been up in a Scottish court because of ignorance of the law. At present many ISPs, newspapers and websites operate light-touch moderation. They do not pre-moderate messages and only remove a message if it is flagged up to them and it is either illegal, or contravenes their own policies for content. Removing material as promptly as the new law appears to require is going to require intense moderation of sites, or else pre-moderation of message boards, building in delays which many users used to immediate posting would find unacceptably slow. By not scrutinisng messages before they are posted publishers retain a defence against an action for defamation (in Scotland there is no distinction between libel and slander \u2013 it's all defamation) called innocent dissemination. In essence this means that those providing forums for debate on the web cannot be sued because they do not know the content of specific messages on their boards. They become liable if that content is flagged up to them and they fail to act upon that warning in a timely manner. Brown said defendant lawyers would fight hard to retain the defence of innocent dissemination against defamation, a civil matter, when the new law is concerned with criminal activity. However, it is easy to see claimant lawyers arguing the reverse and that monitoring for sectarian hatred makes publishers aware of all content, including that which is defamatory. The problem is that even the most basic attention to such messages can make you aware of their content as a publisher and therefore fully liable for them from the point they go up on your site. In one case, even correcting spelling and grammar of posts that appeared on a post meant that the blog publisher could not claim innocent dissemination as a defence. Brown said: \"I commend the Scottish government for applying their minds to this issue, but it's created a minefield.\" Cunningham said: \"The majority of Scots, 91%, supported tougher action to tackle sectarianism. I am under no illusion, this legislation will not be the one-stop solution to all our problems and that is why I recently announced \u00a39m over the next three years to continue work to tackle sectarianism across society. Attitudes change over time and this marks the beginning of the end of the shame that has blighted our glorious game for too long.\" A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Any behaviour covered by the 'Threatening Communications' offence on a website or message board is likely to already be an offence under the Communications Act 2003. The most significant difference with the 2012 act is that such behaviour will now attract a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine rather than only six months. \"The offence covers threats of severe injury or threats intended to incite religious hatred and websites already weeding out threats of this nature have no reason to be concerned.\" David Banks is a media law consultant and legal author",

With Rory Lamont out of action for the next four months after breaking a leg against France last time out, Robinson calls in Nick de Luca to play at centre against Ireland in Dublin. It is where the Edinburgh centre finished the France game after coming on as Lamont's replacement. His promotion from the bench means that elder brother, Sean moves out to the wing, his preferred position, but there is plenty of interest in the shuffling of the replacements. Euan Murray, whose religious beliefs do not allow him to play on Sundays \u2013 he thus missed both Wales and France \u2013 returns but for once not at the immediate expense of Geoff Cross, who remains the starting tight-head prop; Ruaridh Jackson, Robinson's preferred fly-half at the World Cup but injured since, also bides his time as Greig Laidlaw is given a third consecutive start; and Max Evans is back in the match-day 22 less than 48 hours after being the starring turn in an five-day assault case that ended on Monday at Edinburgh Sherrif Court. Evans was cleared of glassing a drinker with a champagne flute at an Edinburgh night club two years ago, and immediately rejoined the squad for a fitness test on a damaged ankle.

      "bodyText": "The Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, has contradicted claims that the housing market is in recovery by reporting a 0.5% fall in house prices during February. The drop offsets a 0.6% rise in January, and is in sharp contrast to the 0.6% rise in prices reported by the Nationwide building society for the same time period. The Halifax three monthly index, the measure its economists prefer because it smooths out blips in house price movements, showed prices being 1.1% lower than in the previous three months, while the annual index shows a 1.9% fall. Martin Ellis, the Halifax housing economist, said the differences were probably caused by the small number of transactions being completed, as it meant a any variation in prices had more impact: \"Overall, prices nationally are at broadly the same level as last spring. This stability in prices is explained by the fact that market conditions have changed very little over this period with demand supported by low interest rates and supply remaining tight.\" He added: \"Falling inflation should relieve some of the pressure on household finances over the coming months. Many of the economic statistics released in recent weeks have also been encouraging, suggesting that the UK may avoid slipping back into recession. \"These developments are positive for the housing market outlook. Significant uncertainties, however, persist and the prospects for house prices during 2012 will, to a large extent, depend on events in the eurozone and the potential knock-on effects on the UK.\" Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight said the Halifax index generally portrayed weaker house prices than other surveys recently, but added that the contrasting figures provided \"a timely reminder that the sector still faces very challenging conditions\". He said housing market activity was being lifted by first-time buyers rushing to complete before the stamp duty concession ends later in March. \"Nevertheless, with housing market activity recently trending up moderately and the economy showing signs of improvement, some of the downside risks to house prices are currently abating. We still expect house prices to drift downwards over the coming months, although we have recently trimmed our forecast overall fall in 2012 to 3% from 5%,\" he said.",

But this is a zombie drama, and the girl in question is already very much dead, even though she may still be shuffling around. Lincoln, in a hugely charismatic performance, plays Rick Grimes, an Atlanta police officer who, after being badly injured in a shootout, wakes from a coma in a suburban hospital to discover his town overrun with zombies. (These are very much off-the-shelf zombies: decomposing people who groan a lot and want to eat anyone left alive.) With the army, police and government seemingly incapacitated, and virtually everybody else shuffling around trying to eat him, Grimes's first task is to keep himself alive. He quickly teams up Morgan Jones (played by fellow Brit actor Lennie James, who seems to be making a niche for himself in this sort of thing; he also starred in the so-so post-nuclear-war drama Jericho) and they spend a little quality time together killing zombies with guns, baseball bats or whatever else comes to hand. There is one hugely disturbing scene when Jones has to sit and watch his wife, now a zombie, shuffling around in the street outside, while he desperately searches her face for any sign of the person she once was. It's moments like this that set it apart from films such as The Evil Dead. It has more in common with a more thoughtful, old-fashioned British storytelling tradition, such as John Wyndham's Day of the Triffids. This isn't just about shocks and gore; it's a thoughtful exploration of characters thrown into an unimaginably horrible world. Who will sink, who will swim, and who will become a zombie? Having said that, nobody would accuse the makers of shying away from the blood-splatter: the camera, notably, never flinches. In one strangely moving scene, Grimes comes across a zombie \u2013 or rather the top half of one \u2013 dragging itself painfully across a field with its hands. The two seem to share a moment before he pulls out his enormous gun and blows its brains all over the grass. It's part of the drama's very strange mixture of compassion and nastiness; perhaps no surprise given that the series creator is Frank Darabont, who directed The Green Mile, a film with similar mixed sensibilities \u2013 remember that botched electric-chair execution? Our hero, meanwhile, having made contact with an entertainingly dysfunctional group of survivors \u2013 including his former police partner and a psychotic survivalist \u2013 go off in search of a \"cure\" for whatever is happening.

And it has proved that there's plenty of life in the zombie drama yet. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2012 because the original said The Walking Dead is now in its third series in the US.

      "bodyText": "When, back in the election-victory afterglow of 2010, George Osborne announced he was cutting all child benefit for higher tax earners, it seemed like a neat trick, whereby you help cut the deficit and can claim \"we're all in it together\" at the same time. Back then, the 2013 date for implementing the changes seemed comfortably in the distance: maybe he thought Britain would be well on the way to economic recovery under his Treasury masterplan, so we'd all see the burden as worthwhile. Now, though, there's a new dynamic. The changes are next year. And even Osborne knows there will be no incipient national feelgood factor in 12 months. So it's reported that he's now planning to water down his proposals. Osborne had originally decided to cut all child benefit for those earning over \u00a343,000. This would have had a huge impact on larger families. Those with three children would lose \u00a32,500. Those with five, \u00a33,800. And there was always the anomaly that a double-income couple earning \u00a340,000 each \u2013 ie, \u00a380,000 in total \u2013 would face no cut, whereas a single-income family on \u00a345,000 would lose everything. (Again, this hits larger families hardest, because the costs of childcare often lead to one partner giving up work.) Despite this, the changes seemed popular. At a time of austerity, there was little sympathy for those who could be called better off, and polls showed that 85% of voters were in favour. I have five kids myself, and when I wrote that \u00a343k is not a lot of money when you have a lot of mouths to feed, it's fair to say that I didn't get a lot of love in return. These sentiments are understandable when the government's overall cuts agenda is hitting so many people. As well as local services such as libraries, daycare centres and youth groups being hit, many people are feeling the pinch directly in their pockets. The most shocking and counter-productive of these changes must surely be the cuts to tax credits, which, as Polly Toynbee pointed out, mean that low-paid working couples with children will lose \u00a33,870 from a typical income of \u00a317,000. These cuts, which gain far less media coverage than the child benefit cuts because they don't affect the Tory core vote, must be fought, and pressure brought on the government \u2013 especially its Liberal Democrat wing \u2013 to back down. As the events in Greece and elsewhere in Europe clearly demonstrate, extreme austerity not only brings immense hardship, it also doesn't help pay off national deficits. But the massive injustice of the tax credits does not make the child benefit cuts fair. What came across strongly in the reaction to Osborne's 2010 announcement was that a lot of people consider that anyone who earns \u00a345,000 is \"rich\". \"Why should bankers be subsidised?\" was a typical comment. It's probably true that someone with no kids will have a very decent disposable income on that salary. But for families, and especially large ones, it's not the case. It's equivalent to a two-income couple earning just over \u00a320k each, and barely enough even to get a mortgage on an average-priced UK house. A large part of this misperception goes back to 1988. That year, in his disastrous inflationary giveaway budget, Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson abolished the top rates of tax. So that instead of a rate of 40% for the relatively well off, and 60% for the rich, there was just one higher rate. Suddenly, everyone could be lumped together as \"rich\"; and this feeling persists, even though we've had a separate 50% rate for the rich (set at those who earn over \u00a3150,000) for nearly three years. The Treasury itself sought to play on this: \"It is not fair to ask someone earning \u00a320,000 to pay for the child benefit that goes to someone earning \u00a380,000 or \u00a3100,000,\" it said, deliberately ignoring the fact that most of those hit would be earning under \u00a350,000. Now, thankfully, it seems the Tories are having a rethink. A report by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that couples with children were being hardest hit by Osborne's cuts. And even the Child Poverty Action Group opposes the child benefit cuts. In truth, though, both Osborne and work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith always knew the changes were unfair.

      "body": "<p>When, back in the election-victory afterglow of 2010, George Osborne announced he was cutting all child benefit for higher tax earners, it seemed like a neat trick, whereby you help cut the deficit and can claim \"we're all in it together\" at the same time. Back then, the 2013 date for implementing the changes seemed comfortably in the distance: maybe he thought Britain would be well on the way to economic recovery under his Treasury masterplan, so we'd all see the burden as worthwhile.</p> <p>Now, though, there's a new dynamic. The changes are next year. And even Osborne knows there will be no incipient national feelgood factor in 12 months. So it's reported that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9122278/Child-benefit-cap-for-high-earners-to-be-watered-down.html\" title=\"\">he's now planning to water down his proposals</a>.</p> <p>Osborne had originally decided to cut all child benefit for those earning over \u00a343,000. This would have had a huge impact on larger families. Those with three children would lose \u00a32,500. Those with five, \u00a33,800. And there was always the anomaly that a double-income couple earning \u00a340,000 each \u2013 ie, \u00a380,000 in total \u2013 would face no cut, whereas a single-income family on \u00a345,000 would lose everything. (Again, this hits larger families hardest, because the costs of childcare often lead to one partner giving up work.)</p> <p>Despite this, the changes seemed popular. At a time of austerity, there was little sympathy for those who could be called better off, and polls showed that 85% of voters were in favour. I have five kids myself, and when I wrote that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/04/osborne-child-benfit-war-families?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">\u00a343k is not a lot of money when you have a lot of mouths to feed</a>, it's fair to say that I didn't get a lot of love in return. These sentiments are understandable when the government's overall cuts agenda is hitting so many people. As well as local services such as libraries, daycare centres and youth groups being hit, many people are feeling the pinch directly in their pockets. The most shocking and counter-productive of these changes must surely be the cuts to tax credits, which, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/01/tax-credits-cut-tories-working-families\" title=\"\">as Polly Toynbee pointed out</a>, mean that low-paid working couples with children will lose \u00a33,870 from a typical income of \u00a317,000.</p> <p>These cuts, which gain far less media coverage than the child benefit cuts because they don't affect the Tory core vote, must be fought, and pressure brought on the government \u2013 especially its Liberal Democrat wing \u2013 to back down. As the events in Greece and elsewhere in Europe clearly demonstrate, extreme austerity not only brings immense hardship, it also doesn't help pay off national deficits.</p> <p>But the massive injustice of the tax credits does not make the child benefit cuts fair. What came across strongly in the reaction to Osborne's 2010 announcement was that a lot of people consider that anyone who earns \u00a345,000 is \"rich\". \"Why should bankers be subsidised?\" was a typical comment. It's probably true that someone with no kids will have a very decent disposable income on that salary. But for families, and especially large ones, it's not the case. It's equivalent to a two-income couple earning just over \u00a320k each, and barely enough even to get a mortgage on an average-priced UK house.</p> <p>A large part of this misperception goes back to 1988. That year, in his disastrous inflationary giveaway budget, Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson abolished the top rates of tax. So that instead of a rate of 40% for the relatively well off, and 60% for the rich, there was just one higher rate. Suddenly, everyone could be lumped together as \"rich\"; and this feeling persists, even though we've had a separate 50% rate for the rich (set at those who earn over \u00a3150,000) for nearly three years. The Treasury itself sought to play on this: \"It is not fair to ask someone earning \u00a320,000 to pay for the child benefit that goes to someone earning \u00a380,000 or \u00a3100,000,\" <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2110244/George-Osborne-backs-bid-cut-child-benefit-following-Tory-revolt.html#ixzz1oLGAw0FQ\" title=\"\">it said</a>, deliberately ignoring the fact that most of those hit would be earning under \u00a350,000.</p> <p>Now, thankfully, it seems the Tories are having a rethink. A report by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/04/couples-children-coalition-tax-benefit?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">couples with children were being hardest hit by Osborne's cuts</a>. And even the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17254985\" title=\"\">Child Poverty Action Group opposes the child benefit cuts</a>. In truth, though, both Osborne and work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith always knew the changes were unfair. They were more interested in the administrative simplicity of fixing the change to the tax bracket. Cameron has admitted that \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jan/13/child-benefit-plans-modified-cameron Osborne\" title=\"\">there's a threshold, a cliff-edge issue</a>\" for those whose earnings go into the higher rate. But he knows that, for the families who are affected by these cuts, it will be his own party's votes that go over a cliff.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>",

But how does an artist see beyond the distractions of faces and clothes to hint at the hidden world of thoughts and emotions? In his painting Woman Reading a Letter, the 17th-century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer achieves this by depicting the most private of all cultural acts: reading. This great painting has just been restored and is going back on view at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The blue of the woman's gown looks deeper than ever, the light from a window that creeps across a map hanging on the wall more silvery. It is a new chance to appreciate one of the most profound of all paintings. Vermeer is a very objective artist. As far as we can tell from his views of the inside and outside of houses in Delft where he lived, he paints what he sees. Furnishings and decorations \u2013 including maps and paintings that he hangs on the wall to introduce layers of symbolism \u2013 are all real, and painted with meticulous accuracy. Women pose for him, dressed presumably as they appear in his pictures. But through his almost scientific scrutiny of visible phenomena, he tells of invisible passions and secret selves. The letter reader in his masterpiece in the Rijksmuseum may be studying a love letter \u2013 that's what we feel from her deep absorption in its contents. Or she may be reading news from a war, for the map behind her suggests navies and armies and campaigns. But what holds us is the act of reading itself, and the look it gives the reader: she is in another world, unaware of the colours and details of the scene that attract us. For her, only the words on that sheet of paper exist. She has forgotten that she is being looked at \u2013 by Vermeer \u2013 as she reads. She is in her own place, a place of the mind. This painting stops time. Looking at it you are drawn into the reader's rapt moment, and forget the beauty of the scene. It invites everyone who looks at it to share this silent, absorbed moment of reading. Dutch art in the 17th-century abounds in visual information. It shows us, like a photograph, exactly what life looked like there and then. But its deepest moments draw away from the dazzle of appearances into the darkness of introspection. Rembrandt is far bolder in the way he goes about this. The shadows and golds of his paintings, ripe with contrast and drama, delve straight into the soul. People seem to look back at you from his epic portraits. Vermeer does not reach for the grandeur that is natural to Rembrandt. He paints the quiet room, the morning light, the woman reading a letter. And in that simplicity, he reveals the power of the inner life.",

      "bodyText": "Are there enough women on the TV and in our media in general? Previous posts and the women's blog's campaign to change the Today programme make it pretty clear what I think, but now it seems that senior producers at Channel 4 and Sky News agree. Both organisations have signed the pledge organised by Broadcast magazine to work to improve the ratio of male-to-female experts. The campaign comes after research from City University showed that male experts outnumbered females by a ratio of four to one across five major TV and radio programmes last year. BBC Radio 4's Today programme was the worst offender, with six times as many male experts in one four-week monitoring period. Which, after Kira Cochrane's research last year for the Guardian, comes as no surprise. In signing the pledge, Channel 4's head of output Ben Monro-Davies wrote: \"Sometimes when we host a debate that comprises three or four white, middle-aged men, it is with a heavy heart, because that line-up isn't 'surprising'. They might be excellent, competent, engaging speakers. But unless the debate is about white, middle-aged men, they aren't necessarily reflective of who the topic might affect.\" While asking for the same 30% (McKinsey has done interesting research on why scale matters in decision making), the Broadcast pledge stops way short of the quotas being mooted for women in the boardroom by the European commissioner Viviane Reding, among others, this week. Yet still the BBC has refused to sign, stating in a piece of semantics worthy of Monty Python that the diversity of its licence fee payers actually rules out signing anything. \"As the BBC is funded by all licence fee payers we cannot endorse individual campaigns and our guest booking has to reflect the choice of leaders and spokespeople by organisations and society at large \u2026 That said, our news programmes are endeavouring, where possible, to increase the use of female spokespeople in all major stories.\" It's hard not to agree that if \"political parties, businesses, public bodies, charities and pressure groups were prepared to promote more women to leadership positions\" media organisations such as the BBC and indeed the Guardian would not have to work hard at all to encourage greater diversity. Yet the BBC, which I am an enormous fan of, is consistently failing to lead the way on this. Is it really good enough to blame society at large for the media's failures? The industry is a special case because it affects how society sees itself. To put it another way, if girls only hear older men asked their opinions while women are confined to the margins, why should they grow up thinking their own opinions matter? The state-owned, self-funded Channel 4 gets this enough to at least show willing, as does the news channel part-owned by Rupert Murdoch. To add to the sense that this isn't just about numbers, the research from City, which gained a grant to study five programmes throughout 2012, found: \"where women were used, it was overwhelmingly as case studies or victims\". So when the deeper voices on Today are interrupted by a higher tone, the women are normally speaking of their problems. I'm not denying that this is a tricky issue. Many media organisations speak of the fact that fewer women agree to go on the radio or TV and speak up. This could be an issue of childcare or confidence, or maybe just the fact that there are always going to be people \u2013 men as well as women \u2013 who don't like appearing on the TV or radio. The BBC should sign up to the pledge and do more than issue key programmes with a database of women experts. After all, it is the only broadcaster with a full-time head of diversity and a requirement as a public body to take active steps to reduce inequality where possible. Otherwise Mark Thompson's mea culpa over older women on the front page of the Daily Mail will just seem like window dressing. We can also do something. Help us monitor the Today programme for its most egregious examples of male-centric programmes and sign the Broadcast petition.",

As well as basic repairs to the workaday building, including full weatherproofing and a proper staircase in place of the current ladder, the dilapidated roof-room where the coastguard kept watch will be turned into a 360 degrees, round-the-compass observatory. The view from the heugh, a local word for cragg or cliff, will take in the whole of the Lindisfarne national nature reserve, 3,500 hectares (8,650 acres) of grassland, saltmarsh, dunes and tidal mudflats which are home to both resident and migrating birds and unusual plants. The reserve, which includes a swath of the mainland coast between Bamburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed, has also been invaded, mind, by the non-native pirri-pirri bur, a menace to dogs and clothes.

Natural England reckons that this view, the first time the whole NNR has been visible from the ground, will be complemented on good days by the Farne islands out to see and the Cheviot hills inland.

It is notable for wildlife, especially in autumn and winter when wildfowl and waders congregate. The 'window' will be sheltered in a stone building with a 'living turf' roof on a site, like the coastguard tower, which has played a part in many islanders' lives. The chair of the community development trust, Dick Patterson, says: I well remember sprinting between the Lookout Tower and the Rocket House as a lad to raise the alarm after the coastguard had spotted a ship in trouble. I'm delighted that our Trust is leading on exciting projects at both sites that will benefit local people and visitors. Both will give an excellent chance to safeguard an important part of the Island's history and also a great opportunity to open the eyes of visitors to the wonderful natural environment here.

      "bodyText": "US evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson was in the UK last month to talk about the field study he has been running for six years in his home town of Binghamton, New York State, in economic decline. \"There are things that are natural to a field biologist, and one of them is to study species in their natural environment,\" explains Wilson. \"Jane Goodall [famous for her studies of chimpanzees] has the Gombe Stream Park [Tanzania] and Darwin's finches are studied in the Gal\u00e1pagos, so why don't we study humans in the context of their everyday life?\" In 2006, Wilson decided to study the 47,000 residents of Binghamton. He hoped that by observing, making predictions based on his theories and then staging interventions to see if those predictions are confirmed, the field study would generate evidence for his evolutionary theories and, in the process \"make the world a better place too\". Wilson's theories are contrary to what we have been told for the last 30-odd years, ever since Richard Dawkins published The Selfish Gene. In contrast to Dawkins, Wilson argues that genetic self-interest is not humankind's default setting and says we are altruistic and co-operative by nature. Prosociality, as he terms it, is a behaviour that gives a group a genuine competitive advantage. \"Selfishness beats altruism within groups, [but] altruistic groups beat selfish groups, and everything else is commentary,\" says Wilson. The idea of testing out these ideas in the field with work in communities was new when Wilson began, as, with the help of a team of graduates and undergraduates, he attempted to measure levels of co-operation across the city. Surveys were carried out among school students, asking them to rate statements such as: \"I think it is important to help other people.\" A map was then created with hills to represent the areas with high co-operation, and valleys representing the low co-operation areas. The team tried to confirm these results by carrying out tests such as dropping letters to see if they got posted and going into schools to play games measuring co-operation. They even canvassed Binghamton neighbourhoods on Halloween and Christmas to see which were lit more decoratively because they believed that the more holiday decorations a neighbourhood had, the more nurturing it was, and so the better its civic health. Wilson then kicked off a number of local projects in order to see if he could use what he calls his \"evolutionary toolkit\" to improve levels of co-operation. The design-your-own-park competition, for example, was supposed to pit neighbourhoods against each other in friendly competition. His educational programme, similarly, was set up to encourage co-operation and friendly competition using design features based on the principles developed by Nobel-prizewinner Elinor Ostrom, including a strong sense of community, a safe environment, and graduated rewards and sanctions. Reviews of his ambitious Binghamton Neighbourhood Project vary from wild enthusiasm, through to bemusement and some fairly patronising write-offs. One recurring question is: what does evolution have to do with all this? In the New York Times, Mark Oppenheimer wondered if Wilson is not \"being a little hasty\" in \"co-opting most any idea he likes as evidence of cultural evolution\". There are a few queries, too, about his methodology, given the enormous scale of the project and an approach that can appear scattershot. Wilson is disarmingly honest about the fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants nature of the research and has previously paraphrased Einstein by saying: \"If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be research.\" As for results, the work is still at an early stage but Wilson points to his academic programme for at-risk students where the students significantly outperformed their comparison group in a randomised controlled trial. The students, who had failed at least three out of five courses in their previous year, were made to feel part of a special unit in an extremely safe and nurturing environment, given lots of short-term incentives and genuine responsibility in running the programme. Having been out in the cold for decades, his theories are now finding favour with politicians and policy thinktanks on both sides of the Atlantic who are desperate to engage communities in their own neighbourhoods to work together at solving intractable social ills more effectively and cheaply than the state. They resonate too with questions about communities and co-operation in the age of social media that sociologists such as Richard Sennett are grappling with, and the wellbeing agenda being pushed by economist Richard Layard. Wilson was in the UK at the invitation of the Co-operative Group, which is keen to make a case that co-operative behaviour is the norm, not the exception. \"We want people to begin thinking differently, to realise that the norm is not the man who doesn't get his round in when everyone is in the pub, but the man who does,\" says the Co-op's head of social goals Paul Monaghan. The group is considering setting up a UK version of Binghamton, and is talking to Wilson about how this could work. In the US, Mary Webster describes herself as \"this little mouse in David's maze, behaving just the way I should\". The 71-year-old has been involved in community work in her home town of Binghamton for over a decade, but a couple of years ago her group, Safer Streets, became one of several taking part in Wilson's field study. Webster says that slowly she can see some results. She is now in charge of three design-your-own park competitions, and she says that some neighbours with whom she had been clashing turned up out of the blue to one of the block parties with a huge tray of tacos. \"That's the sort of thing that gives me a shiver down my back,\" she says. \"Local schools are now coming to us, we're talking to the city council, people seem to be taking us more seriously.\" But it's slow work, she concedes. \"You know the funniest thing? David thinks I'm some sort of incredible example of altruism. But I started all this because the neighbourhood was going downhill and I didn't want my house to get less valuable. So really, I'm as self-interested as anyone. What do you think of that?\" Wilson laughs when I relay Mary's words. \"Mary told me that the very first day we met,\" he says. \"But in fact, she could express her self-interest in any number of ways \u2013 by leaving the neighbourhood, by investing in a security system, by attempting to drive out the bad element, and so on. Instead, she expresses it by working to improve the whole neighbourhood. If she succeeds, then she will share in the improvement of the neighbourhood, but it will be at great personal cost. That's altruism defined in behavioural terms. Perhaps altruism makes the altruist feel good, or is performed out of a sense of duty, or to gain admission into heaven, or is based on a sense of enlightened self-interest. Insofar as they result in the same society-oriented behaviours, they can be regarded as functionally equivalent.\" He adds: \"Perhaps Mary really is entirely self-interested in her own mind, but in my experience, it is extremely common for altruists to profess selfish motives as a way to downplay what they do. It's not altruistic to wear altruism on your sleeve!\" Curriculum vitae Age 63. Status Married, two daughters. Lives Binghamton, New York.

      "body": "<p>US evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson was in the UK last month to talk about the field study he has been running for six years in his home town of Binghamton, New York State, in economic decline.</p> <p>\"There are things that are natural to a field biologist, and one of them is to study species in their natural environment,\" explains Wilson. \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Goodall\" title=\"Wikipedia: Jane Goodall\">Jane Goodall</a> [famous for her studies of chimpanzees] has the Gombe Stream Park [Tanzania] and Darwin's finches are studied in the Gal\u00e1pagos, so why don't we study humans in the context of their everyday life?\"</p> <p>In 2006, Wilson decided to study the 47,000 residents of Binghamton. He hoped that by observing, making predictions based on his theories and then staging interventions to see if those predictions are confirmed, the field study would generate evidence for his evolutionary theories and, in the process \"make the world a better place too\".</p> <p>Wilson's theories are contrary to what we have been told for the last 30-odd years, ever since Richard Dawkins published The Selfish Gene. In contrast to Dawkins, Wilson argues that genetic self-interest is not humankind's default setting and says we are altruistic and co-operative by nature. Prosociality, as he terms it, is a behaviour that gives a group a genuine competitive advantage.</p> <p>\"Selfishness beats altruism within groups, [but] altruistic groups beat selfish groups, and everything else is commentary,\" says Wilson.</p> <p>The idea of testing out these ideas in the field with work in communities was new when Wilson began, as, with the help of a team of graduates and undergraduates, he attempted to measure levels of co-operation across the city. Surveys were carried out among school students, asking them to rate statements such as: \"I think it is important to help other people.\" A map was then created with hills to represent the areas with high co-operation, and valleys representing the low co-operation areas.</p> <p>The team tried to confirm these results by carrying out tests such as dropping letters to see if they got posted and going into schools to play games measuring co-operation. They even canvassed Binghamton neighbourhoods on Halloween and Christmas to see which were lit more decoratively because they believed that the more holiday decorations a neighbourhood had, the more nurturing it was, and so the better its civic health.</p> <p>Wilson then kicked off a number of local projects in order to see if he could use what he calls his \"evolutionary toolkit\" to improve levels of co-operation. The design-your-own-park competition, for example, was supposed to pit neighbourhoods against each other in friendly competition. His educational programme, similarly, was set up to encourage co-operation and friendly competition using design features based on the principles developed by Nobel-prizewinner <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom\" title=\"Wikipedia: Elinor Ostrom\">Elinor Ostrom</a>, including a strong sense of community, a safe environment, and graduated rewards and sanctions.</p> <p>Reviews of his ambitious Binghamton Neighbourhood Project vary from wild enthusiasm, through to bemusement and some fairly patronising write-offs. One recurring question is: what does evolution have to do with all this? In the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/books/the-neighborhood-project-by-david-sloan-wilson-review.html\" title=\"\">New York Times, Mark Oppenheimer wondered if Wilson is not \"being a little hasty\" in \"co-opting most any idea he likes as evidence of cultural evolution\"</a>. There are a few queries, too, about his methodology, given the enormous scale of the project and an approach that can appear scattershot.</p> <p>Wilson is disarmingly honest about the fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants nature of the research and has previously paraphrased Einstein by saying: \"If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be research.\"</p> <p>As for results, the work is still at an early stage but Wilson points to his academic programme for at-risk students where the students significantly outperformed their comparison group in a randomised controlled trial. The students, who had failed at least three out of five courses in their previous year, were made to feel part of a special unit in an extremely safe and nurturing environment, given lots of short-term incentives and genuine responsibility in running the programme.</p> <p>Having been out in the cold for decades, his theories are now finding favour with politicians and policy thinktanks on both sides of the Atlantic who are desperate to engage communities in their own neighbourhoods to work together at solving intractable social ills more effectively and cheaply than the state.</p> <p>They resonate too with questions about communities and co-operation in the age of social media that sociologists such as Richard Sennett are grappling with, and the wellbeing agenda being pushed by economist Richard Layard.</p> <p>Wilson was in the UK at the invitation of the Co-operative Group, which is keen to make a case that co-operative behaviour is the norm, not the exception. \"We want people to begin thinking differently, to realise that the norm is not the man who doesn't get his round in when everyone is in the pub, but the man who does,\" says the Co-op's head of social goals Paul Monaghan. The group is considering setting up a UK version of Binghamton, and is talking to Wilson about how this could work.</p> <p>In the US, Mary Webster describes herself as \"this little mouse in David's maze, behaving just the way I should\". The 71-year-old has been involved in community work in her home town of Binghamton for over a decade, but a couple of years ago her group, Safer Streets, became one of several taking part in Wilson's field study.</p> <p>Webster says that slowly she can see some results. She is now in charge of three design-your-own park competitions, and she says that some neighbours with whom she had been clashing turned up out of the blue to one of the block parties with a huge tray of tacos. \"That's the sort of thing that gives me a shiver down my back,\" she says. \"Local schools are now coming to us, we're talking to the city council, people seem to be taking us more seriously.\"</p> <p>But it's slow work, she concedes. \"You know the funniest thing? David thinks I'm some sort of incredible example of altruism. But I started all this because the neighbourhood was going downhill and I didn't want my house to get less valuable. So really, I'm as self-interested as anyone.

      "bodyText": "There is rarely much doubt about the fervour of Ron Paul's supporters. But even so, Kate Dalebout, 23, counts as one of the most enthusiastic. Cradling her 14-month old baby and waiting for her hero to speak at a rally in her hometown of Moscow, Idaho, she explained that her husband worked as a teacher for a local school. But, despite the fact her young family relied almost solely on a government wage, Dalebout said she and her spouse were vehement Ron Paul supporters even though the budget-slashing Texan congressman wanted to scrap the department of education. \"There would be less money spent on education. We are OK with that,\" Dalebout said. \"It would be better for the country as a whole. We are not focused on ourselves.\" Yet, despite such hardcore support, the Paul campaign remains without a win in the 2012 Republican race. It is hoping to change that in today's Super Tuesday polls by making a serious bid for Idaho, a vast but sparsely populated slice of the American west. It could prove to be fertile ground. In 2008, Paul won 24% of the vote in Idaho, in what was then a primary contest. It was Paul's strongest showing by far. Since then, his campaign has only grown stronger and now Idaho is holding a caucus vote, which should favour his committed, hardworking support base. Paul has also devoted a massive amount of time to the state compared with his rivals. Paul spent Tuesday in Idaho criss-crossing its mountains and valleys and making four campaign stops. On Super Tuesday itself he is due to hold yet another rally near the state's biggest city, Boise. \"He thinks he can pull this off in Idaho. He thinks he has a chance of winning,\" said Professor Gary Moncrief, a political scientist at Boise State University. At the meeting in Moscow, Paul addressed a crowd of more than 1,000 in the local university's vast sports arena. He hit all his usual themes: calling for US troops to come home, promising massive cuts, condemning government and vowing to fight for a different monetary policy. He framed it all in the context of a revolution of ideas. \"Even armies can't stop an idea whose time has come \u2026 I see a turning point,\" he said. But Paul is not the only candidate with an interest here. Idaho is deep in the Republican heartland with a strong anti-government streak. That makes it ideal territory for Paul but also a good test for Mitt Romney to see if the frontrunner can win in a state so dominated by conservatives. Romney has cause for hope. In nearby Wyoming, which held a lengthy series of precinct caucus meetings that concluded a week ago, Romney won 39% of the vote, compared with 32% for former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum and 21% for Paul. If Romney could repeat that performance in Idaho it would show he can win states where conservatives dominate. That victory would be used to answer critics who say he fails to excite the activist base. Romney, too, has spent valuable time in the state recently. He pulled in big crowds at an Idaho Falls rally and is hoping for a boost from the quarter or so of the population that shares his Mormon faith. Suddenly, Idaho \u2013 usually ignored in the nomination race \u2013 has attracted national interest. \"The local party here has moved Idaho up the calendar in order to have more of a voice and they have been successful. Idaho has got a lot of attention,\" said Moncrief. But Idaho remains a fundamental test for the Paul campaign and it has pulled out all the stops. In a cheeky move aimed at tweaking the nose of the Romney campaign, the Paul team in Idaho has recruited members of Romney's family; the campaign is touting five distant relatives who all bear the surname Romney but at the caucuses will be urging Idaho residents to vote for Paul. \"I support Ron Paul because he defends the constitution, loves America and understands what it means to be an American,\" said Travis Romney, who is a second cousin once removed to the former Massachusetts governor. But, unlike Romney, winning the popular vote is not the be all and end all for the Paul campaign. Idaho is a classic example of a state where Paul's \"delegate strategy\" could bear fruit. That refers to the plan to focus on the complex rules often deployed by caucus states in the ways they apportion the delegates sent to the national party convention in Tampa in August. It is often a Byzantine process that favours more committed supporters, rather than those who just turn up, vote and leave. With its hardcore voters, the Paul campaign is betting it will get a far larger proportion of delegates than its headline popular vote would suggest. And it is those vital delegates who will officially pick the Republican nominee at the party convention. Paul's aim is to take as many delegates as he can to Florida in order to \u2013 at minimum \u2013 grab a primetime speaking slot and influence the party's policy platform. Idaho could be a rich haul. The state has 32 delegates; a greater number than more publicised states like Nevada, Iowa and New Hampshire. \"We are not cheating the system,\" said Doug Wead, a senior Ron Paul adviser. \"It is a poor man's campaign. It is a chance for people who really care to express themselves. The people who win the delegates in the caucus states are the people who will care enough to put the work in.\" Paul himself, speaking to reporters after the Moscow rally, said the strategy was working well in caucus states so far and already bringing in more delegates than rivals who beat him in the popular vote. \"Our supporters are willing to go through the process,\" he said. Scott Thurston, 53, is one of those who care enough to be an activist. He will be speaking at an Idaho caucus, acting as a campaign surrogate and urging his fellow Idahoans to back Paul. He has been a Paul supporter since the 1990s, even maintaining a website devoted to him. Thurston is overjoyed at the delegate strategy. \"I think he'll get the majority of delegates in Idaho,\" he said. Wead said he was convinced the Paul campaign could also win the popular vote in Idaho. But he added that the Paul campaign had wider aims than those of rivals. \"We have got a campaign for Ron Paul that wants to win but we also have an educational side to it. We are thrilled with that. There are many victories besides the simple result.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ah, the romance which was Blackpool reaching the Premier League. The tangerine shirts, the tower, the nostalgic gust of Stanley Matthews and football in its simpler, 1950s image. Yet amid all that heartwarming sentiment as Ian Holloway's team played manfully and just failed to stay in the billionaires' league, it always seemed that last season Owen Oyston and his family, who own the club, were conspicuously not spending modern football's great promotion windfall, but banking it. On Friday, published while the chairman, Karl Oyston, Owen's son, was on holiday, came the astonishing, unsentimental, black and white financial record of the Tangerines' single season in the world's richest league. The club's income increased by \u00a342m due to the Premier League's vast TV rights deals, but Karl Oyston kept Blackpool's wage bill to almost the same as in the 2010 Championship promotion season. So fully \u00a332m surplus was recorded, at 17,000-seat Bloomfield Road, which had a temporary stand at one end. And with part of that, the Oystons paid themselves the highest salary, by many millions, ever awarded to a director, even in football's fabulously overpaid executive class. You had to look twice, then again, to make sure you were not seeing too many noughts, before accepting that lovely old Blackpool, now back in the Championship, really did pay a company owned by Owen Oyston a salary of \u00a311,000,000. That revelation, in a sport only now coming to terms with the century-old reality that the men in charge of \"clubs\" are not just chairmen, but owners, has prompted open-mouthed outrage. To the tradition of directors being \"custodians\", the \u00a311m looks like outsized two fingers. Of the fans' reactions, blasting across the internet, the most succinct has been the repeated exclamation: \"At least Dick Turpin wore a mask!\" Yet Karl Oyston, discussing it while in transit on holiday, was emphatically not apologetic, as he explained the circumstances, which are not quite as straightforward as they appear. To clarify, the \u00a311m was paid not to Owen Oyston personally, but out of Blackpool to a company Oyston Sr owns: Zabaxe. Karl Oyston says his father has not taken the money personally and will not be spending it on indulgences \u2013 \"He does not lead an extravagant lifestyle.\" The reason the money was paid out of the club, rather than sitting in its account as a huge cash surplus, was for tax planning, Karl Oyston said. \"We have done all this on professional advice. We were advised that if we left the money in the football club it could attract a very large tax bill, which would fall on the football club. \"The money has been paid to my father's company, and if the club needs it for the next stage of development, which is to build a new training ground, I am sure my father will lend it to the club interest-free, as he always has over 25 years of ownership.\" Famously determined to keep players' wages below gigantic, and not pay agents if he can help it, Karl Oyston says he refused to spend Blackpool's Premier League bonanza on players' wages in an effort to stay up. Blackpool did sign the striker James Beattie and midfielder Andy Reid in January 2011 and Oyston appears disappointed with the impact they made in return for the wages they commanded. \"I am stubborn, I just won't blow the club's money, so we had a big cash surplus,\" he argues. \"If I had spent the \u00a311m on players' wages, nobody would be complaining, but that money would be gone to Ferrari dealers and whatever else players spend it on. So many clubs have fallen into financial trouble by paying players too much \u2013 I don't see a massive queue of ex-Portsmouth players lining up at Fratton Park to help Portsmouth now.\" He argues that his running of Blackpool \u2013 sticking with managers, not serially sacking them, keeping wages affordable but with a \u00a35m bonus incentive to the players for winning promotion, and gradually rebuilding a Bloomfield Road, which was partly condemned when he became chairman \u2013 is being vindicated. Blackpool's coffers will fill again this year whether the club win promotion or not \u2013 they are enjoying the first year of massively increased parachute payments from the Premier League's \u00a33.5bn 2010-13 TV deal: \u00a316m for each of the first two seasons after relegation, \u00a38m for two after that. He does not think, therefore, that in fact the club will need any of the \u00a311m back for the training ground, which he believes will cost around \u00a35m, an upgrade from the ragged Squires Gate site largely unchanged since Matthews ran around on it. Karl Oyston points to his family's ownership of Blackpool as a success story, given that his father, a Blackpool fan, bought the club in 1987 when Bloomfield Road was about to be sold for a supermarket and the club faced extinction. After his father's conviction for rape in 1996, Karl Oyston's mother, Vicki, took over as the chairman for dire years at a tumbledown ground. Oyston Jr took over in 2000 and Blackpool were immediately relegated to the bottom division. Since then he has clattered the club up to the Premier League, and now back in the upper reaches of the Championship, rebuilt three sides of Bloomfield Road, is currently filling in the south-east corner, and preparing to build the new training ground. \"I'm a rebel against the whole way things are done in football,\" he says. \"Everywhere I go in the boardrooms I hear the same thing: clubs are overspending by \u00a35m on players and agents. Perhaps it is because this is a job I was given by my family, to sort out the mess of the football club; I didn't come into football for some dream.\" He says that in 25 years, Owen Oyston put in money in return for shares, although he does not say whether it amounts to \u00a311m. The family loaned substantial money to mop up losses, and contributed to the ground rebuilding, while not taking interest, dividends or large salaries out. He points to other clubs: Birmingham City and Coventry City with investor owners, hit with transfer embargos; Portsmouth and Rangers insolvent, Leicester City, announcing a \u00a315m loss and \u00a327.5m loans from the club's Thai owners, at 8% interest. \"We are not in trouble, like so many other clubs,\" he says. \"I find it perverse: if I'd spent in on players I'd be lauded, but we're being pilloried. The \u00a311m was paid out as part of sound tax planning \u2013 we are UK-based and believe in paying our taxes but still have to plan sensibly. I understand, it was paid to Zabaxe as a salary and people will draw the conclusion it is a salary to my father. We could have explained it better. But the money is in an Oyston company; the football club is an Oyston company too, and that money is there should we require it. \"But frankly,\" he argues, \"after the way he has supported the club all these years, if it was an \u00a311m salary to my father, so what?\"",

      "bodyText": "Outside the US, an all-too-apparent note of surprise can be the immediate response to the idea that the heartland of capitalism also shelters a healthy co-operative economy. But the United States is, above all, a diverse land. Look closely and there are about 29,000 co-operatives businesses across the country, with between them some 350 million members. For Paul Hazen, a Board member of the International Co-operative Alliance and the previous chief executive of US National Co-operative Business Association (NCBA), this is entirely to be expected. Co-operatives offer solutions for all Americans, regardless of their social background, he claims: \"It's the American dream \u2013 the idea that anyone can be an owner of a business. And it's very easy to join a coop,\" he says. He detects a resurgence in interest in co-operatives during the present recession, mirroring in some respects the wave of co-ops which occurred during the Great Depression. \"It's a natural response if the market isn't functioning properly to get together with neighbours and see if you can find a solution by working together,\" he explains. Recent years have seen considerable interest in workers' co-operatives \u2013 one example is the cleaning co-operative S\u00ed Se Puede, set up by Teresa Perez and fourteen other immigrant women in New York city which has grown quickly and helped the women members triple their income. As in the UK, there is also a burgeoning network of consumer-owned wholefood and organic food shops, tapping in to a demand for the sort of food which major stores like WalMart don't offer. Nevertheless, when it comes to the larger co-operative businesses in the US, there is a strong sense of history and of the mid-West. Agricultural co-operatives head the Co-op 100 league table produced each year by the National Co-operative Bank (NCB), together generating just about half of the $193 bn revenue earned in 2010 by the top hundred co-op businesses. Even outside the US, some of their names will be familiar: Ocean Spray, for example, has been supplying cranberries to eat with the turkey roast ever since Marcus L Urann and two fellow cranberry growers first set up their co-op in 1930. The enterprise is now co-owned by its 600 cooperative grower-members. The largest US co-operative, the Minnesota-based CHS Inc, also operates in the agricultural sector. It has accessed equity capital by offering non-voting preference stock on the NASDAQ market and is currently in position 103 in the Fortune 500 table of US corporates. Second to CHS in the NCB league table is dairy producer Land O'Lakes. The rural areas of America are also home to the network of more than 900 rural electricity co-operatives, which together supply electricity to more than 42 million Americans, in 47 of the 50 states. \"We've been fortunate that the electric co-ops have created a national brand and advertise their co-operative principles and values,\" Paul Hazen says, adding that regrettably not all co-ops choose to promote their co-operative structures quite so directly. NCBA surveys suggest that about 40% of the US adult population know what a co-operative is and how it functions. Within the overall US co-operative movement, for which the NCBA plays a role similar to that of Co-operatives UK in Britain, there is also a strong financial sector, including not only the National Co-operative Bank but also the network of 7,500 credit unions. US credit unions have played a big role in the development of the global organisation, the World Council of Credit Unions, which has its head office in Wisconsin. In the absence of a universal state-provided health service, co-operatives such as HealthPartners and Group Health Co-operative (both turning over more than three billion dollars annually in revenue) offer their members access to health care. The US also has a much stronger tradition of housing co-operatives than in Britain. According to the NCB, the country has about eight thousand housing co-ops which together provide more than a million homes. Another feature of the US co-operative movement has been its determination to engage directly in overseas development work. Paul Hazen, who stepped down in January this year after twelve years in the top job at NCBA, is now executive director for the Overseas Co-operative Development Council (OCDC), the umbrella group which links a number of co-op-led development agencies. He argues that US co-operative organisations have long had a strong global vision, reflected among other things in the Co-operative for American Remittances to Europe initiative in 1945 which was strongly backed by NCBA as a way of helping fellow co-operative movements in war-torn Europe. Post war, US co-operative support has been instrumental among other things in helping the Indian co-operative sector, including supporting the creation of the Indian Farmers Fertilizer Co-operative now the largest fertiliser business in Asia. As elsewhere in the world, the NCBA and other US co-operative organisations are hoping to make the most of this year's UN International Year of Co-operatives (IYC) to promote the co-operative message. The timing is good, given the dissatisfaction felt by many towards corporate America after the 2007-8 financial crisis and the subsequent global recession. The NCBA is currently lobbying in Washington for a new National Co-operative Development Act, and is also reminding cooperatives of the value of registering for the .coop high-level Internet domain name, a initiative first introduced ten years ago. For Paul Hazen, the IYC also offers the chance to reposition co-operatives in popular consciousness as a modern business form. \"We want to use the IYC as a springboard, to get the message across that co-ops are innovative and cutting edge. They aren't an alternative - they are mainstream successful businesses which are creating jobs,\" he says.",

      "bodyText": "If Barack Obama and Bibi Netanyahu liked each other more, you might almost think they'd worked it out. If the two men were pals, you could guess that the little performance the two of them laid on in Washington over the last few days had been carefully choreographed, a \"good cop, bad cop\" routine staged for the benefit of the only audience that matters: the regime in Iran. But the American president and the Israeli prime minister are not pals, far from it. That much was obvious when they were photographed sitting together in the White House on Monday, the body language still chilly between the two \u2013 even if it lacked the barely-concealed hostility of their encounter in May 2011, when Netanyahu presumed to lecture Obama in his own office. But there is no hiding it. As Aluf Benn, editor in chief of the Israeli daily Haaretz, wrote at the weekend, \"the contacts between Netanyahu and Obama are devoid of warmth, mutual esteem and credibility.\" The president sees the Israeli PM \"as a liar who uses subversive tactics, shamelessly meddles in American politics and is encouraging the Republican campaign to topple him,\" wrote Benn, while \"Netanyahu sees Obama as a spineless leftwinger whose fantasies about world peace are threatening Israel with the prospect of a second Holocaust.\" So, not exactly chums, then. Which means that what we saw played out was real rather than confected. With the America-Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) conference in Washington as the backdrop, the two men have been conducting a negotiation in public. The message of the president in his weekend speech to the pro-Israel lobby group was to cool the \"loose talk\" of war with Iran and to give non-military forms of pressure on Tehran \u2013 sanctions and, to a lesser extent, diplomacy \u2013 time to work. Netanyahu's reply, in his speech Monday night, was a declaration of his own impatience: \"We've waited for diplomacy to work,\" he said. \"We've waited for sanctions to work. None of us can afford to wait much longer.\" In this negotiation, both men have leverage. Obama's resides in the fact that, for all the Israeli leader's bluster, Netanyahu does not want to go it alone. Both politically and militarily, he wants the backing of the United States. Indeed, Netanyahu's urgency partly arises out of his fear that the longer he waits, the more time Iran would have to secrete its nuclear installations deep underground, out of reach of Israeli firepower and where only US \"bunker-buster\" bombs could find them. All of which lent a certain irony to his insistence last night that \"Israel must always have the ability to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.\" If that were completely true, then Netanyahu would have had no need to plead his case in Washington. But the Israeli PM has leverage too, provided by the calendar. He knows that the last thing Obama needs between now and election day on 6 November is yet another war involving the US. Part of the president's pitch to the voters will be his winding down of George W Bush's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; new conflict in Iran undermines that message. More importantly, an attack on Iran could trigger a surge in oil prices, inflicting immediate damage on America's economic prospects. Yet, it's hard for Obama to give Israel a clear red light to military action when he faces a clutch of Republican presidential candidates desperate to cast him as insufficiently supportive of Israel. Mitt Romney and the others may believe they can win over some of the Jewish vote \u2013 a stunning 78% of which chose Obama over John McCain in 2008 \u2013 even though most experts reckon Jewish support for the president is holding firm. More likely, Republican leaders calculate that rattling the sabre for Israel helps them with the much larger Christian evangelical bloc, for whom support for Israel has become an article of faith. So, the task for Obama is managing Netanyahu, offering him sufficient reassurance that Israel holds off, at least till 7 November. It's not that the president doesn't believe there's a problem with Iran and its nuclear ambitions \u2013 even as a candidate in 2008, Obama was surprisingly hawkish on the Iranian question. As he reiterated in his interview with the Atlantic last week, when he says that he intends to stop Iran acquiring a bomb, he means it. The dispute with Israel is chiefly over timing and when, exactly, Iran will be deemed to have crossed the red line: is the crucial moment when Tehran has the ability to make a nuclear weapon or when it has actually done so? The danger is that this public negotiation unleashes a dynamic of its own. The more Netanyahu bangs the drum for war \u2013 Monday night, he compared the Iranian threat, once again, to the Nazis \u2013 the harder it becomes for him to back down. What kind of concession could Obama extract from Tehran that would be enough to placate Bibi? As Israelis put it, now that Netanyahu has climbed up the tree, how does he get down? \u2022 Commenting will remain open on this article for 24 hours and may be switched off overnight Follow Jonathan Freedland on Twitter @j_freedland",

      "bodyText": "Capcom's eccentric tank sim is a throwback to a distant era \u2013 and that is meant as a compliment. As a game experience, it is as bulky and unforgiving as the machine you're required to pilot. It forces you to become proficient at weird, complex controls, in a strange fraught environment. If you're expecting to sit down with the family for a few minutes of Disneyfied tank fun, you're going to have a horrible shock. This is where motion controls go hardcore. Set in a future that has been blasted back to 1940s technology by an apocalyptic computer virus, the game sees crusty old tank commander, Winfield Powers (best tank commander name ever) returning to the front line in order to quell an invasion of America by a new, unknown super power. Throughout the game you sit down in your hulking bipedal vehicle, with a machine gun loader on the left, a missile loader on the right and a subcom perched at your side shouting intel into your ears. And you blow stuff up. In my hands-on session with the game, I start with the tutorial mission, which takes place in a scruffy military base. As I walk to the vehicle in a first-person view, one of my crew saunters up to me and stretches an arm out \u2013 it takes a while for me to figure out that I actually need to physically offer my own hand to shake his. This is almost certainly the first time a game has ever made me feel awkward about social etiquette, and in a title filled with such gestures and interactions, it won't be the last. Inside the tank, a huge instrument panel awaits your flailing attention. A yanking motion with your right hand switches the engine on, a lever pull with your left gets it into gear, then you're ready to chuck the analogue stick forward and move off. In the cockpit position, your view of the landscape ahead is confined to a teeny letter box - but if you push your controller forward, you're put into a full-screen mode that lets you view the world as though in a first-person shooter. Around the parameter of the screen are various other contraptions to grab. Reaching up accesses the periscope, essentially a sniper sight used to aim at distance objects. A slightly lower grab will bring down the shutter on your viewing window, while aiming your hand more to the right brings out an instrument panel, complete with switches for vehicle lights and smoke evacuation. There's also a self-destruct button. I have no idea when I'll need that, but it's the last button I want to hit by mistake. At first, it's all rather overwhelming, especially when you chuck in the monitor screen on the left, which can be swung round to show you four camera views of your tank's surroundings - great for spotting enemies and mission objectives. The vehicle chugs onto the firing range like a volvo on wonky scaffolding stilts. It hisses and steams, and your tank chums whine and shout. A superior officer yells at you continually through an intercom. I feel like I'm in a steampunk Top Gun. During your first desperate lunges at the instrumentation, you often grab at the wrong bits and pieces. I was constantly bringing down the metal shutter on my windscreen instead of the periscope, or moving into the first-person view, only to immediately pan out again when I accidentally jogged my pad. After a while though, you learn to trust the hand icon that appears on the screen whenever you lift an arm \u2013 you only need delicate movements to get it into position, and then it clamps around the relevant lever or handle with eager accuracy. Eventually, you're swapping gracefully between first-person view and periscope while swishing your arm left or right to swirl round and check on your crew. My favourite though, is standing up, which opens the top hatch and lets you have a peek outside. Cup your hands to your eyes and you get a binoculars view. You will feel like Field Marshal Montgomery, although from outside your window, you will actually look like a lunatic conducting an animated argument with your TV. And in some ways, of course, your are. I learn the basics of tank fighting on the firing range, switching between armour-piercing and incendiary rounds to blast different objects. Then I'm let loose on an early mission, where allied forces are storming Lower Manhattan. It's a scene reminiscent of the New York invasion mission in Modern Warfare, except here you don't just sprint up the beach following a kindly commander. There's no one to follow \u2013 just soldiers and armoured vehicles everywhere, blasting at each other below a charcoal black sky. I switch into high gear (it's faster but harder to manoeuvre) and leg it up the coast, attempting a complex periscope-assisted shot at two enemy tanks far off at the back of the bay. My subcom is yelling something about mines, there are alarms going off; a shell hits the tank, turning the screen red and sending me jolting backwards. It's equally exciting and confusing. The big problem \u2013 or challenge, let's call it \u2013 is navigating this beast through the dense action environment. Even in slow gear it can be tricky to get the thing where you need it, while organising your attack option. Later, we're in the bomb-blasted streets of the financial district, having to deal with RPGs and tanks (that are clearly piloted by experts rather than a waving idiot like myself), scuttling between city blocks pounding me with fire. But it is also hugely immersive, the claustrophobia and panic of the unique interior testing both your tactical prowess and your ability to interact with this frantic virtual environment. I also love the interplay with your weird, often faintly psychotic crew. There are around 30 members to choose from before missions, all with different strengths and weaknesses. In my demo, for example, I am accompanied by a twitchy left gunner who swears his way through a lengthy diatribe about how crap it is to be a left gunner, and then swears his way through every subsequent encounter. He is Hudson from Aliens, but less reserved. Indeed, when I saw a demo of this game last year, it was this character who panicked and tried to climb out of the tank. Apparently, you have to drag him back in and punch him. I've heard from another journalist that if you don't get him inside in time, all that you pull back are a pair of smoking legs. This has yet to be confirmed, but I wouldn't put it past Steel Battalion's dev team. My subcom, Natch, meanwhile, seems to be nursing a small crush on Winfield; after one successful tutorial task he puts out his fist for me to bump \u2013 but when I fumble my response he looks away crestfallen, muttering apologies about being over-enthusiastic. When my failed fist movement is finally registred on the screen, it unintentially becomes an awkward grope at Natch's face. You could have cut the tension with a knifing movement \u2013 as long as you did it clearly enough for Kinect to understand. Anyways, the action isn't confined to the the tank. At certain points, you have to get outside to complete sub-missions, like helping a wounded member of another tank crew. These look to be short on-rails events, but they provide a brief counterpoint to all that cockpit tension. You'll also get enemy soldiers trying to get in the tank, or lob in grenades; if that happens, you need to open a hatch in the floor and pop it out. Your tank apparently has eight damage points and its perforamce will be affected if one of these is shelled. Get too much damage on one leg for example, and your tank hobbles like ED 209 on a spiral staircase. The story takes you from New York, to Europe and into the deserts of Northern Africa, with each location providing different gameplay experiences. Morocco, for example, is more about exploration and surviving the environment, than combat. Your vehicle is also customisable, with parts available to be scavenged from the battlefield. Steel Battallion will remind old timers of '90s mech monsters such as Virtual On, or even idiosycratic gems like train sim Densha de Go, which came with its own vast controller \u2013 as did, of course, the original Steel Battalion on the Xbox. Honestly, don't be fooled by the Kinect integration \u2013 this is a challenging, hardcore mech battler, with tons of bizarre little moments that'll delight gamers willing to try something a bit offbeat and bluntly challenging. It is this year's Dark Souls. But in a tank. With a panicking maniac and a comms expert who may or may not fancy you. Good luck out there, commander. \u2022 Steel Battalion: Heavy Armour is out on Xbox 360 on 19 June (US) and 22 June (Europe)",

      "body": "<p>Capcom's eccentric tank sim is a throwback to a distant era \u2013 and that is meant as a compliment. As a game experience, it is as bulky and unforgiving as the machine you're required to pilot. It forces you to become proficient at weird, complex controls, in a strange fraught environment. If you're expecting to sit down with the family for a few minutes of Disneyfied tank fun, you're going to have a horrible shock. This is where motion controls go hardcore.</p> <p>Set in a future that has been blasted back to 1940s technology by an apocalyptic computer virus, the game sees crusty old tank commander, Winfield Powers (best tank commander name <em>ever</em>) returning to the front line in order to quell an invasion of America by a new, unknown super power. Throughout the game you sit down in your hulking bipedal vehicle, with a machine gun loader on the left, a missile loader on the right and a subcom perched at your side shouting intel into your ears. And you blow stuff up.</p> <p>In my hands-on session with the game, I start with the tutorial mission, which takes place in a scruffy military base. As I walk to the vehicle in a first-person view, one of my crew saunters up to me and stretches an arm out \u2013 it takes a while for me to figure out that I actually need to physically offer my own hand to shake his. This is almost certainly the first time a game has ever made me feel awkward about social etiquette, and in a title filled with such gestures and interactions, it won't be the last.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386970437\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/3/6/1331040169632/Steel-Battalion-005.jpg\" alt=\"Steel Battalion\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steel Battalion</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inside the tank, a huge instrument panel awaits your flailing attention. A yanking motion with your right hand switches the engine on, a lever pull with your left gets it into gear, then you're ready to chuck the analogue stick forward and move off. In the cockpit position, your view of the landscape ahead is confined to a teeny letter box - but if you push your controller forward, you're put into a full-screen mode that lets you view the world as though in a first-person shooter. </p> <p>Around the parameter of the screen are various other contraptions to grab. Reaching up accesses the periscope, essentially a sniper sight used to aim at distance objects. A slightly lower grab will bring down the shutter on your viewing window, while aiming your hand more to the right brings out an instrument panel, complete with switches for vehicle lights and smoke evacuation. There's also a self-destruct button. I have no idea when I'll need that, but it's the last button I want to hit by mistake.</p> <p>At first, it's all rather overwhelming, especially when you chuck in the monitor screen on the left, which can be swung round to show you four camera views of your tank's surroundings - great for spotting enemies and mission objectives. The vehicle chugs onto the firing range like a volvo on wonky scaffolding stilts. It hisses and steams, and your tank chums whine and shout. A superior officer yells at you continually through an intercom. I feel like I'm in a steampunk Top Gun.</p> <p>During your first desperate lunges at the instrumentation, you often grab at the wrong bits and pieces. I was constantly bringing down the metal shutter on my windscreen instead of the periscope, or moving into the first-person view, only to immediately pan out again when I accidentally jogged my pad. After a while though, you learn to trust the hand icon that appears on the screen whenever you lift an arm \u2013 you only need delicate movements to get it into position, and then it clamps around the relevant lever or handle with eager accuracy. </p> <p>Eventually, you're swapping gracefully between first-person view and periscope while swishing your arm left or right to swirl round and check on your crew. My favourite though, is standing up, which opens the top hatch and lets you have a peek outside. Cup your hands to your eyes and you get a binoculars view. You will feel like Field Marshal Montgomery, although from outside your window, you will actually look like a lunatic conducting an animated argument with your TV. And in some ways, of course, your are. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386970438\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/3/6/1331040031504/Steel-Battalion-005.jpg\" alt=\"Steel Battalion\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steel Battalion</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I learn the basics of tank fighting on the firing range, switching between armour-piercing and incendiary rounds to blast different objects. Then I'm let loose on an early mission, where allied forces are storming Lower Manhattan. It's a scene reminiscent of the New York invasion mission in Modern Warfare, except here you don't just sprint up the beach following a kindly commander. There's no one to follow \u2013 just soldiers and armoured vehicles everywhere, blasting at each other below a charcoal black sky. </p> <p>I switch into high gear (it's faster but harder to manoeuvre) and leg it up the coast, attempting a complex periscope-assisted shot at two enemy tanks far off at the back of the bay. My subcom is yelling something about mines, there are alarms going off; a shell hits the tank, turning the screen red and sending me jolting backwards. It's equally exciting and confusing.</p> <p>The big problem \u2013 or challenge, let's call it \u2013 is navigating this beast through the dense action environment. Even in slow gear it can be tricky to get the thing where you need it, while organising your attack option. Later, we're in the bomb-blasted streets of the financial district, having to deal with RPGs and tanks (that are clearly piloted by experts rather than a waving idiot like myself), scuttling between city blocks pounding me with fire. </p> <p>But it is also hugely immersive, the claustrophobia and panic of the unique interior testing both your tactical prowess and your ability to interact with this frantic virtual environment. I also love the interplay with your weird, often faintly psychotic crew. There are around 30 members to choose from before missions, all with different strengths and weaknesses. </p> <p>In my demo, for example, I am accompanied by a twitchy left gunner who swears his way through a lengthy diatribe about how crap it is to be a left gunner, and then swears his way through every subsequent encounter. He is Hudson from Aliens, but less reserved. Indeed, when I saw a demo of this game last year, it was this character who panicked and tried to climb out of the tank. Apparently, you have to drag him back in and punch him. I've heard from another journalist that if you don't get him inside in time, all that you pull back are a pair of smoking legs. This has yet to be confirmed, but I wouldn't put it past Steel Battalion's dev team.</p> <p>My subcom, Natch, meanwhile, seems to be nursing a small crush on Winfield; after one successful tutorial task he puts out his fist for me to bump \u2013 but when I fumble my response he looks away crestfallen, muttering apologies about being over-enthusiastic.

According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), Brazil has now overtaken the UK as the world's sixth largest economy. Despite growing at a mere 3.5% last year (against 7.5% over the previous few years) the Latin American powerhouse has seen its GDP reach a record \u00a31.6tn. And it's not about to hit the buffers any time soon. Population: Partly explains the above. As well as being the world's sixth largest economy, Brazil is also the world's sixth most populous country. It has around 200 million people and is (another plus) overwhelmingly young: some 62% of Brazilians are under 29 years of age. The country also has the the largest number of people of Japanese descent outside Japan. Although that's probably not relevant. Football: Now we're getting to it. As they say in Brazil: \"Os ingleses o inventaram, os brasileiros o aperfei\u00e7oaram\" (\"The English invented it, the Brazilians perfected it\"). The most successful national football team in the history of the Fifa World Cup, Brazil are the only national team to have played in every World Cup finals and have lifted the trophy a record five times Beaches: The Brazilian equivalent of \"just my cup of tea\" is apparently \"\u00e9 minha praia\" (\"That's my beach\"); that's two different cultures for you. More than 8,000 miles of glorious coastline and a host of cultural icons: The Girl from Ipanema, Copacabana, Havaianas flip-flops, unfeasibly small bikinis, eponymous waxings ... Tropical rainforest: Loads of it (and disappearing slightly less fast than before). Exotic indigenous peoples: The national Indian foundation Funai has confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil. UK: Economy: Not so hot. In economist-speak, the politest way to put it is that Britain's recovery \"failed to gain any traction in 2011\". The latest figures suggest the UK economy grew by a lousy 0.9% for the full year, having actually gone into reverse by 0.2% at the end of the year. The gloomier forecasts for this year predict a further 1% shrinkage. Go Blighty! Population: Well, we're trying. Britain's population is growing at its fastest rate in almost half a century, but it's still barely a third the size of Brazil's. According to the Office for National Statistics, 62.3 million people were living in Britain in 2010, around 0.8% more than the previous year. Football: We (at least, the English) drew up the first set of modern rules for the Beautiful Game. We boast the world's oldest association football club (Sheffield FC), the first national team (with Scotland), the first national league and the first knockout cup. Other than that, we apparently won the World Cup, once, a long time ago. Since then the best we've done is fourth.

      "bodyText": "Regulars at The Head of Steam on Huddersfield station can expect a change from their usual viewing this week as televised sport in the pub gives way to a series of harrowing films about domestic violence. Seven short films, called Lives, by Yorkshire artist Beverley Addy will be played in pubs, hairdressers, shops and other public places across the town in a launch coinciding with International Women's Day on 8 March. Addy says the project was born out of her own experience of an abusive relationship and a desire to \"hold a mirror up to society\" and get people talking about an issue that is still taboo. For the films she ran a series of workshops with women who had used domestic violence services and asked them: \"What sights and sounds make your hair stand on end?\" \"They said 'hot things', so in one of the abstract films I use a pulsing electric cooker ring and an iron. And I weave in other images that kept cropping up, like falling down stairs and the sound of doors slamming,\" explains Addy. There are three text-only films using animated words, and two narratives, one based on a woman's description of how she rode her bike along a canal towpath to try to get away from the horrible thoughts in her head. Just one of the Arts Council-funded films features the victim herself: a woman who describes how, when she was pregnant, her partner pushed her down the stairs and she miscarried. Addy says: \"Sometimes the emotional abuse was as damaging as the violence. At the mundane end it's men saying they don't like what you're wearing. But that's not about the clothes, it's about pulling the rug from under you and controlling you. \"It's hard for people to talk about all this. The women described how, slowly slowly, their confidence was ground down and they felt smaller and smaller.\" At the film's preview at the Lawrence Batley theatre in Huddersfield last week one woman wrote in the comments' book: \"It reminded me of my life and my childhood.\" Another noted: \"That film with the doors slamming \u2013 I was back there.\" Addy says: \"I apologise to anybody who is upset because they've been through it. Material like this is not often seen by the general public, but art should not exist in a bubble. \"It's not a public information film, but maybe it might make a man in a pub reflect on his behaviour. Or a woman in a hairdresser watching while she waits for her colour to take might think, 'Oh my God, I don't want to be like that.' \"If it saves someone wasting five or 10 years of their life being somebody they really don't want to be, that would be great.\"",

      "bodyText": "Famously wedded to her pink sofa, founder member Barbara Cartland probably wouldn't have approved of the fact that bestselling author Katie Fforde, who has just been named contemporary romance novelist of the year by the Romantic Novelists' Association, went on a survival course to research her new book. Fforde foraged, built fires and constructed shelters to learn about life as an explorer, the chosen occupation for the hero in her award-winning novel Summer of Love. \"The whole premise is of a girl getting pregnant and then having no contact with the father, so I needed a good reason for that without having him be a complete bastard,\" said Fforde. \"So I gave him this job, and I've brought bits from the course in to the book. I didn't know anything about exploring but it was the best fun you can have while wearing a duvet coat and sleeping in a pop-up tent \u2013 I was totally out of my comfort zone.\" Summer of Love, set in the English countryside where single mother Sian Bishop tries to make a new life only to stumble again upon the handsome Guy Berresford, took the RNA award for the best contemporary romance on Monday. The prize for the best epic romantic novel was won by Rosie Thomas for her multi-generational story of a family, The Kashmir Shawl, which moves from the life of newlywed Nerys as she is posted to Kashmir, to that of her granddaughter Mair as she uncovers family secrets. Best historical novel was Christina Courtenay's Highland Storms, best romantic comedy was Jane Lovering's Please Don't Stop the Music and best young adult romance was Caroline Green's Dark Ride. All five novels will now compete for the overall romantic novel of the year prize, which counts Joanna Trollope and Philippa Gregory among its former winners. Despite reports of a decline in the popularity of romantic fiction, the Romantic Novelists' Association insisted that the prizes showed \"the breadth\" of the genre, and that it is still alive and kicking. \"Like Mark Twain, I think the reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated,\" said author and chair Annie Ashurst. \"We feel it is thriving. We have a new writers' scheme and this year 13 new authors have got contracts with publishers, which is amazing \u2013 the most we have ever had. There is a strong appetite there for romantic fiction from publishers, not just from the public.\" Fforde agreed. \"I really don't think romantic fiction is dying in the way people say it is. People still want romance, especially when times are hard,\" she said.",

      "bodyText": "Public health is currently in a state of transition, with the responsibility of public health services transferring from the NHS to local authorities across the country by April 2013 under plans set out in the government's public health white paper last summer. Each primary care trust (PCT) is required to submit an integrated plan for public health to the Department of Health by the start of April, ensuring that transition measures have been developed with local authorities for the next year. Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies and LGA chief executive Carolyn Downs have also written to local authorities providing advice and support on appointing new joint directors of public health. But according to a recent NHS Future Forum report, the NHS and its staff must also continue to do more to prevent poor health by \"making every contact count\". The report, The NHS's role in the public's health (pdf), recommends that NHS staff should promote healthy lifestyles through contact with the public and also set a good example themselves. The NHS should also refocus on prevention and promotion in public health through commissioning and sharing best practice through the new Public Health England, according to the report. So how can the NHS deliver a successful public health transition? And in what ways can the proposals \u2013 which have been accepted by the government \u2013 successfully be adopted in the new evolving NHS? Join us from 12pm on Wednesday to discuss all this and more with our panel. You can also leave your questions ahead of the discussion below, or tweet us at @GdnHealthcare. Panel Richard Shircore is an advisor to the Royal Society for Public Health on commissioning and an independent health promotion consultant. Dr Keith Reid is co-chair of the BMA's public health committee. David Buck is a senior fellow in public health and inequalities at The King's Fund. Previously he worked at the Department of Health as head of health inequalities. Dr Alison Hill is managing director at NHS Solutions for Public Health. She is also director of the South East Region Public Health Observatory. Dr Ian Walton is a GP commissioner, chair of the professional executive committee at Sandwell PCT and spoke at the NHS Confederation's event on public health and clinical commissioning last month. Dr Felix Greaves is a research fellow in the department of primary care and public health at Imperial College London and is a public health registrar. Dr David McCoy is a consultant in public health medicine in London and is based at the Centre for International Health and Development at University College London. He was also managing editor of the Global Health Watch. This article is published by Guardian Professional. Join the healthcare network to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes when you have to demonstrate your authority the best thing to do is pick a fight. Or better still let someone start the row for you. Miche\u00e1l Martin can thank his most recalcitrant and awkward of parliamentary colleagues for allowing the leader of Fianna F\u00e1il to show who is boss. The grandson of \u00c9amon de Valera, the founder of Fianna F\u00e1il, initiated a rebellion on Europe late last week that would have warmed the cockles of British eurosceptic hearts. \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv's apparent opposition to the EU fiscal treaty, which Irish voters will be asked to endorse in a forthcoming referendum, would not have been out of place at the UK Independence party's annual conference last weekend. While Martin and Fianna F\u00e1il have come out in favour of saying yes to the EU fiscal compact, \u00d3 Cu\u00edv expressed grave doubts about it and indicated he would probably vote no. He spent Saturday and Sunday at Fianna F\u00e1il's annual gathering \u2013 or ard fheis \u2013 in Dublin looking rather sheepish after being slapped down by the party leader. Martin went even further at the end of the ard fheis and warned that anyone from Fianna F\u00e1il sharing an anti-EU platform would face internal party discipline. Through the \u00d3 Cu\u00edv row Martin has displayed grit and determination and, according to long-term Fianna F\u00e1il sources, secured his leadership as the party seeks to rebuild after its historic defeat in last year's general election. Ard Fheis 2012 was the beginning of Fianna F\u00e1il's resurrection from its near-death experience just over 12 months ago when it suffered its greatest loss of deputies and failed to win a seat in Dublin. But another resurrection \u2013 that of ghosts of its recent past \u2013 pose a problem for the party. Brian Cowen, who was blamed for the disastrous terms of Ireland's international bailout, attended the conference. Some delegates gave him a rousing ovation which has gone down badly with a general public still bearing the brunt of austerity cuts and smouldering over the Irish bank rescue programme which has poured billions of euros into the country's poorly managed banks. There were other reminders of Fianna F\u00e1il's failings while in power. As party members filed into Dublin's RDS for the conference, hundreds of people queued patiently to get into an exhibition held in the same venue, for foreign companies and businesses looking for Irish workers to settle abroad. The lines of would-be migrants was a stark demonstration of the human face of a 14.2% unemployment rate that led to the migration of 50,000 workers last year. The final skull at the Fianna F\u00e1il banquet could be the most damaging \u2013 the presence of Bertie Ahern. Fianna F\u00e1il's Tony Blair, the young, energetic, ideologically neutral leader who delivered a hat-trick of election victories for Ireland's one-time number one party now cuts a divisive figure. He still has core supporters who adore him but there are many in the party high command who regard him as an electoral liability. Ahern too gets much of the blame for the wasted years of the Celtic Tiger when the property boom was allowed to get out of control and the economy to overheat to danger-level. Ahern's defenders will point out that he achieved a great deal in office and, most crucially of all, established enough trust and confidence with unionists (first with David Trimble and later Ian Paisley) to persuade them into an historic compromise in the north with republicans. Even Paisley himself has repeatedly stated that Ahern played a critical role in demonstrating good faith to the unionist community and keeping his word when he promised that Sinn F\u00e9in would start supporting the police and the justice system in Northern Ireland. Yet even his greatest fans cannot ignore the potential danger his legacy poses. Within the next few weeks a report on political corruption in Dublin will be published. It is expected that the Mahon inquiry, which started off by investigating corrupt practices between politicians and property speculators in north County Dublin, will be critical of Ahern's personal finances. The report will also question the validity of the evidence Ahern gave at the Mahon tribunal. There may even be, according to the same Fianna F\u00e1il sources, criticism of the way he used funds donated by businessmen to support the party. In its existential struggle to stave off a threat from Sinn F\u00e9in, riding high in recent opinion polls ahead of Fianna F\u00e1il, Martin may need to pick another scrap even more significant than the one he seems to have won with De Valera's grandson. Martin may have to give the Ahern legacy a good kicking in order to create critical distance between New Fianna F\u00e1il and a party perceived for so long as being in the pockets of an avaricious nexus of bankers, builders and speculators.",

Unlike other stars she runs her own account, using Twitter to chat directly to her \"little monsters\" as she calls fans, post pictures and share information about tours and releases. She took over as the most popular person on Twitter from Britney Spears in August 2010. Like any Twitter user, a smattering of recent tweets reveal Lady Gaga's key obsessions. \"Told you MINT would be big in fashion this spring. Naturally, I will continue to wear black. (perpetual mourner),\" she informed her Coke-can headdress wearing fans. A recent tweet about a cookie \u2013 \"The chef at hotel made me a surprise. So awesome to see the message spreading already. One cookie at a time.\" \u2013 inspired 179 comments. A tweet on Valentine's Day gave fans some sage advice: \"Happy Valentine's Day everyone. If you have someone special, give them a kiss. If you don't, make a voodoo doll of your ex and cast spells.\" Despite an ever-morphing number of experts, commentators and political leaders on Twitter, the five most followed people all come from the world of pop. Lady Gaga leads the pack, with teen star Justin Bieber following close behind with 18 million followers. Statistics from twittercounter.com suggest Gaga's daily Twitter growth rate is consistently higher than Bieber's, meaning her supremacy looks unlikely to be challenged in the near future.

Barack Obama can only manage eighth place with 12.84 million followers of his @barackobama account. Lady Gaga's online presence is key to her success, which saw her sell 8m copies of her latest album, Born This Way. As well as 20 million Twitter followers she has 48.8 million fans on Facebook and is in approximately 830,000 circles on Google+. She recently launched her own social network, Little Monsters, which gives her fans an outlet to create or share Lady Gaga-related content, and communicate with other fans to show whether they like what other users post.",

In response, protests took place where Muslims inadvertently killed more than 30 other Muslims in anger. Apologies were issued by the president of America himself; the religious authorities in Afghanistan (the Ulema council) have stated that these actions \"could not be forgiven and an apology is not enough. The criminals of this action should be openly prosecuted and punished as soon as possible\". I'm speechless. Caliph Uthman, one of the four \"rightly guided caliphs\", ordered that all copies of the Qur'anic text that were different to the dialect of the Quraysh be burned. From the earliest days of Islam to the modern era, burning texts with the name of God, Allah, and/or whole copies of the Qur'an have been an accepted form of disposal. The wisdom behind Caliph Uthman's approach was that certain versions of the Qur'an were authored in different dialects, thus misrepresenting the spirit and message of the Qur'an. In parallel, many of the materials being burnt at the airbase were misquotes of the Qur'an used to validate terrorist ideologies. That is to say that in both cases, the Qur'anic text was not representative of the prophet Muhammad's message (peace be upon him), and in both cases were destroyed by burning. At worst, the actions in Bagram were intentional, to insult Muslims, but how could this be when an Afghan man \u2013 presumably a Muslim \u2013 was among them? At best, it was a simply a bad decision, irrespective of general Muslim ignorance of their own faith: that burning texts with Qur'anic script is permissible. Whatever the case, Islam teaches us the importance of forgiveness. The prophet Muhammad, when facing ignorance and abuse, once spoke: \"O Allah, guide these people, as they did not know what they were doing.\" And the Qur'an is full of verses speaking on the subject of forgiveness, such as, \"Show forgiveness, encourage what is good, and do not punish the foolish\" (7:199). The Qur'an has become, to so many, nothing more than a text which is recited beautifully, echoing the prophet Muhammad's own sentiment, that a time will come when it will not pass beyond the people's throat. In the words of Egyptian cleric Gamal al-Banna: \"Human dignity must be at the root of all social, economic, and political policies, and anything which threatens human dignity, whether in body or in soul, must be completely forbidden.\" Protests leading to the death of people, for a method of disposing of the Qur'an, which is lawful, are the antithesis of an understanding of faith and human dignity. The prophet Muhammad once said that there was a wealthy merchant who would lend people money. When he saw that some struggled to repay the debt he would tell his children who administered his financial affairs: \"Pardon him his debt, perhaps Allah will pardon us.\" Given the apathy of Muslims worldwide to the values which the message of Islam preaches such as addressing hunger, providing safe shelter, availability of medicine, adopting justice and fairness, eradicating pollution and most of all, mutual respect regardless of faith, when bad things happen which do not cause us (Muslims) harm, and we receive an apology, perhaps we should listen and accept it.

      "bodyText": "During a recent visit to Kampala, Uganda, we heard multiple stories of people being forced to move because the government or local business wanted to acquire land they had inhabited for generations. In one case, the bodyguard of a government official addressing disputes over a land acquisition project opened fire on protesters, killing two. The official and his guard now face murder charges. Such cases, where disproportionate force is used against people resisting land projects, are becoming common in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. As Liz Alden Wily pointed out on the Poverty Matters blog, many plots of land throughout Africa do not have individual ownership or well-recognised customary titles for collective ownership. This lack of clear ownership rights allows investors \u2013 domestic or foreign, state-owned or private, small or large \u2013 to stake a claim. But ownership isn't the only issue. Titled or untitled, land is often taken over without due process by invoking the loosely defined doctrine of eminent domain (by which the government can appropriate private property). And where there are contracts, they often disproportionately favour those with power. The principles of participation, transparency and accountability, which form the cornerstone of the notion of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), are usually absent in such transactions. Corporate buyers typically contend that any investments they make in land will bring economic benefit to communities as well as to the government \u2013 and the acquirer. But the story in Africa (and elsewhere) shows that benefits too often are shared only between companies and local elites, while surrounding communities end up worse off. What leads so many land deals in Africa to such destructive results for local communities? One factor is that those people most affected by land deals usually lack financial resources and the negotiating power to defend their rights. Their claims to land ownership are easily exploited by governments and by some companies. But there are signs that situation may finally be changing. In 2010 the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, in considering a case by the Endorois people of Kenya, moved towards institutionalising and providing greater protection to traditional ownership of land. The commission concluded: \"Traditional possession of land by indigenous people has the equivalent effect as that of a state-granted full property title\", and that \"indigenous peoples who have unwillingly lost possession of their lands, when those lands have been lawfully transferred to innocent third parties, are entitled to restitution thereof or to obtain other lands of equal extension and quality\". This is an encouraging sign of greater legal protection for traditional landholders. But for the growing number of companies investing in Africa, what \u2013 in practical terms \u2013 should be done when states offer prime land on a platter? How should companies respond if they learn that people who lived off that land are likely to be evicted forcefully, and are unlikely to have any documentation proving ownership of the place from which they were forcibly removed? To ensure that the process of acquiring or using land is transparent, and in keeping with international human rights principles, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation has launched an effort to develop guidelines on responsible governance of tenure of land and other natural resources. The focus of this effort on the state's role in protecting rights is of vital importance. Olivier de Schutter, UN special rapporteur on the right to food, has called for guidelines to protect the vulnerable against land grabbing. Earlier, the UN Human Rights Council's unanimous adoption of guiding principles to implement the protect-respect-remedy framework on business and human rights (pdf) is another step in the right direction. It clarifies state obligations to protect human rights from abuses involving private participants such as companies, the independent responsibility of all businesses to respect human rights, and where there is a governance gap, the need for remedies that are consistent with human rights standards. But the reality remains that states often fail to protect human rights. So what should companies do? In an effort to provide practical guidance based on international human rights principles and standards, the Institute for Human Rights and Business embarked in 2009 on a project on business responsibilities towards use and acquisition of land. This initiative has resulted in a set of draft guidelines (pdf) targeted at the business sector, which are due to be finalised later this year. The guidelines are based on the principles of transparency, accountability and non-discrimination, and provide step-by-step advice to businesses to help them avoid conduct that undermines human rights. Such steps won't be sufficient to ensure corporate respect for human rights in all cases, but they are a necessary stage in an ongoing process of due diligence that will help companies ensure they respect the dignity of local communities. We think that is a good place to start. \u2022 Salil Tripathi is director of policy at the Institute for Human Rights and Business. Wambui Kimathi is senior consultant for Africa at the institute",

A row broke out after the enlargement directorate of the European commission, which is responsible for the expansion of the EU, released a video clip that was designed to appeal to young voters. The video, entitled Growing Together, features a white woman dressed in yellow \u2013 the colour of the stars of the EU \u2013 walking calmly through a warehouse. As a gong sounds, she looks behind her as an aggressive Chinese-looking man shouting kung fu slogans jumps down in the style of the film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. As he moves towards her, an Indian-looking man in traditional dress wielding a knife levitates towards her. He is a master of kalaripayattu, a martial art from the southern Indian state of Kerala. As she deals with him, a black man with dreadlocks cartwheels towards her in the style of capoeira, the Brazilian martial art. The woman stares at the men. She then multiplies herself to form a circle around the men who drop their weapons and sit down. The woman's yellow outfit then turns into the stars of the EU. The video shows the words: \"The more we are, the stronger we are.\" It then says: \"Click here to learn more about EU enlargement.\" Raoul Ruparel, of Open Europe, said: \"This was an ill-advised move by the European commission. It is strange because normally there is something of the Kum Ba Yah about the commission. But it has produced a video which shows a white female being threatened by foreign men with weapons. This is in dubious taste and judgment. \"We also question whether it was necessary to produce the video in the first place. We are in favour of EU enlargement but we are not sure that making viral videos is the best way to go about that.\" Stefano Sannino, the director general of the enlargement division of the European commission, said: \"We have received a lot of feedback on our latest video clip, including from people concerned about the message it was sending. It was a viral clip targeting, through social networks and new media, a young audience (16-24) who understand the plots and themes of martial arts films and video games. The reactions of these target audiences to the clip have in fact been positive, as had those of the focus groups on whom the concept had been tested. \"The clip featured typical characters for the martial arts genre: kung fu, capoeira and kalaripayattu masters; it started with demonstration of their skills and ended with all characters showing their mutual respect, concluding in a position of peace and harmony. The genre was chosen to attract young people and to raise their curiosity on an important EU policy. The clip was absolutely not intended to be racist and we obviously regret that it has been perceived in this way. We apologise to anyone who may have felt offended. Given these controversies, we have decided to stop the campaign immediately and to withdraw the video.\"",

      "bodyText": "The first major commercial airline flight into Somalia's volatile capital in more than 20 years has touched down safely. Turkish Airlines' maiden flight to Mogadishu was the first from outside east Africa since the country descended into anarchy and war. It was the latest sign of confidence in growing stability in the Somali capital \u2013 and of Turkey's emergence as an influential geopolitical player. Bekir Bozdag, the Turkish deputy prime minister, was among a high-profile delegation on board the flight from Istanbul's Atat\u00fcrk airport. He was welcomed by Somalia's president, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, as well as the acting prime minister, parliamentary speaker and other members of the cabinet. Bozdag said: \"After 20 years of a lack of international flights to Europe, Asia and America, the Turkish government has facilitated for the Somalis to travel by Turkish Airlines to the world again.\" UN ambassadors and officials were also present. A group of women danced and sang as the aircraft landed at an airport that for many years was controlled by rival militia groups. Turkey's national carrier intends to operate a twice-weekly passenger service from Istanbul and hopes it will prove popular with Somali exiles around the world. Cemalettin Kani Torun, the Turkish ambassador to Somalia, told the Africa Review website that Turkish Airlines flew to 146 destinations around the world, adding: \"Such a huge network will facilitate diaspora Somalis flying home.\" A number of private airlines, including Kenya-based African Express, fly into Somalia from neighbouring countries but Turkish Airlines is the first from outside the region. Security in Mogadishu was stepped up ahead of the flight, with main roads leading to the airport blocked off. Heavily armed police could be seen manning checkpoints. The flight follows a visit to Mogadishu last year by the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said he wanted to challenge the idea that the Somali capital was a no-go area. Erdogan, the first leader from outside Africa to visit for nearly two decades, said he would set up an embassy in Somalia and promised major infrastructure projects in Mogadishu. Turkey has been quicker than other countries to make its presence felt in reconstruction efforts since the militant Islamist group al-Shabaab was driven out of Mogadishu by African Union soldiers. Some 200 Turkish nationals are now living and working in the city on construction, logistics, aid and other projects, while over the past year Turkey has reportedly sent $365m in cash and in-kind aid to Somalia. In December, Turkish officials announced a plan to modernise Mogadishu's Aden Abdulle international airport. Istanbul will host a follow-up to the recent London conference on Somalia in June. The engagement reflects Turkey's efforts to boost its profile in Africa, as it has in the Middle East in recent years, and to promote itself as a model Muslim democracy. It has increased trade and opened several new African embassies, mainly in Islamic states. Somalia has been engulfed in chaos and conflict for more than 20 years. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimates that fighting, famine and disease have killed up to a million people since the last government collapsed in 1991. But al-Shabaab is under attack on several fronts, with troops from Kenya and Ethiopia also gaining territory recently.",

In December, Turkish officials announced a plan to modernise Mogadishu's Aden Abdulle international airport.</p> <p>Istanbul will host a follow-up to the recent London conference on Somalia in June.</p> <p>The engagement reflects Turkey's efforts to boost its profile in Africa, as it has in the Middle East in recent years, and to promote itself as a model Muslim democracy. It has increased trade and opened several new African embassies, mainly in Islamic states.</p> <p>Somalia has been engulfed in chaos and conflict for more than 20 years. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimates that fighting, famine and disease have killed up to a million people since the last government collapsed in 1991. But al-Shabaab is under attack on several fronts, with troops from Kenya and Ethiopia also gaining territory recently.</p>",

Until recently the vast majority of Bangladeshis migrating to France came as asylum seekers. But the interior ministry concluded that many of these applications were \"unfounded\" and largely driven by economic motives, prompting the French Agency for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (Ofpra) to put Bangladesh on its list of \"safe countries\". Applications for political asylum by people from these countries are given \"priority\" treatment, with no protection against deportation, even if they appeal against a rejected application. Last week, several hundred Bangladeshis demonstrated in Paris demanding that Bangladesh be removed from the list of safe countries, which limits access to refugee status. \"Human rights are disregarded and the press is no longer free [in Bangladesh],\" asserted a flyer signed by the Bangladesh Federation, the main organisation behind the protest. \"I arrived on 10 November and they took my fingerprints,\" said one woman. \"On 26 January, I heard my application had been refused. I don't have any family in France. I can't go back to Bangladesh either, but next month I won't have anywhere to live. They should have warned us.\" The rise in immigration from Bangladesh is part of a larger trend, with growing numbers of asylum seekers and serious overloading of French detention centres, which have been underfunded for years. All the more reason, according to the interior ministry, to change the status of Bangladesh. A mission to Bangladesh in November 2010 by Ofpra pinpointed many outstanding problems: \"corruption which affects the working of institutions \u2026 and compromises impartiality\", \"underhand expropriation of land targeting the poorest people\", and the \"obvious inadequacy of checks and balances\". \"One of the main problems we have with asylum applications relates to the difficulty of lodging a complaint in Bangladesh. Only members of the ruling parties can authorise a complaint,\" said Klaudia Miosga, a barrister specialising in immigration law. \"Putting Bangladesh on the list of safe countries is the result of a mistaken understanding of the situation,\" adds Abdul Maleque Forazi, 53, head of the Bangladesh Federation.

      "bodyText": "I have a new neighbour a few doors down. Since he moved in a couple of weeks ago I could count on one hand the number of times I've walked past his window day or night without seeing him sitting there alone staring out into the street. The window is huge and looks directly on to the pavement. The pavement looks directly into the room. The man sits on a folding wooden chair surrounded by a litter of cardboard boxes. If it weren't for the thin pane of glass that divides us I could reach out and shake his hand. In one sense I know nothing about the man. My assumptions are all conjecture. But in another way, I feel I know far too much. I strongly suspect he has mental health problems, that he is isolated, that the football shirt he has hung in the window is not so much an advertisement for his club as a tiny, futile attempt to create some sort of barrier between himself and the world outside. I could be wrong, of course. But I don't think I am. The sense of recognition is too strong. It is hard for those living in more private circumstances to appreciate just how public life in social housing can feel. Partly this is due to the nature of the flats. However, small, inadequately soundproofed flats are by no means unique to social housing: more significant is the fact that a social tenancy is so difficult to get. Demand so massively outstrips supply that if a young single person is given a flat, everyone knows there must be a reason for it. And the reason, if not quite public knowledge, is certainly an object of public interest, most particularly to the longer-term residents. Feeding this interest is the highly visible nature of the various interventions. Police, bailiffs and ambulances can be obvious and regular visitors. As can social and support workers, at least to those in the know. Some tenants respond by abandoning any attempt at privacy. One mother who lived near to me used to call her kids from across the street. \"No, you come here! I can't come out, can I; I got a fucking tag on!\" And then, of course, you recognise your own. You may recognise people personally, having seen them on the wards or in the waiting room. Or you may, as with my new neighbour, recognise a situation. The inevitable question is how to respond. It's straightforward enough if you have reason to believe a neighbour is at serious risk. In that situation you have an obligation to act. But my current dilemma is more common and much more complex. In a sense, not responding is impossible; I cannot \"unaware\" myself of something I am aware of, walking on past is in itself a response. I've tried smiling, but even that felt intrusive, let alone knocking on the door and offering some curtains. And it's not only my neighbour I'm thinking of. I have to protect my own boundaries. For professionals these come with the role and indeed enable it. Hours and a place of work should help to protect other times and places for things outside work. When you live next door to someone you must establish such boundaries yourself. This is something that I, like many people, struggle with. It may be 3am but if someone's in need, it's difficult to say no. If you know that support is available, this makes things much easier for everyone. But in the age of the \"big society\", professional support is being cut dramatically. Situations such as this are going to become ever more common. I do hope someone's considered the implications.

They also feature the performing arts and the basement contains a superb theatre, just right for illustrating the dialogue between cultures advocated in the institution's charter. In the case of the Puppet Master, such dialogue involves a French director, Dominique Pitoiset, who heads the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National in Bordeaux, and Vietnam's tradition of mua roi nuoc (water puppets). This unique art form, only found in Vietnam, was in danger of disappearing altogether in the 1960s when the National Theatre was set up in Hanoi, duly gathering up the secrets of the puppets' construction and operation, and the repertoire from surviving artists. This timely move saved from oblivion a tradition dating back to at least the 12th century, which was part of the rice-growing culture in the northern part of the country. For centuries the technique was carried on, serving the same stories, fed by daily life and mythology. The sculpted, brightly coloured wooden puppets are between 40cm and a metre tall, so as to create an impression of perspective. They are operated by marionettists standing up to their chests in water. The largest puppets are fitted with floats and an ingenious system of rods and wires, which enables them to perform remarkably sophisticated movements. Some of them even spit water and fire onto the surface of the murky pool, which conceals all the machinery, with its poles, wires and stakes. Pitoiset is not the first westerner to rediscover this tradition and the magical scenes it conjures up. In 2010 Robert Lepage made excellent use of this art form to breathe new life into Stravinsky's Song of the Nightingale. Here the approach is more restrained and the Puppet Master is pretty close to what you might see in Vietnam, apart from the pictures of the countryside projected onto the backdrop, giving the show the feel of a travelogue. Dragons and serpents, silver and gold fish range around the rice-growers' imaginary landscape. Here too are goddesses and immortals, peasants and buffaloes, fishermen and boats with wickerwork roofs. The puppets are magnificent and brilliantly operated by their masters, dressed in waterproof dungarees. But rather than drawing on the many traditional tales, which are packed with action, Pitoiset and his team have opted for more poetic drama \u2013 which is a bit thin \u2013 focusing on work and passing time, the beauty of nature, life and death. But thanks to the contribution of singer, narrator and musician Ngo Thi Quam, the spell finally took hold. This article originally appeared in Le Monde",

      "bodyText": "In the final round of previews for the 2012 MLS season we ask Western Conference fans about their memories of last year and hopes and predictions for the coming campaign. Warning: may contain bias. Chivas USA Julio Ramos, \"Chivas Mayor\", Union Ultras What was the highlight of 2011? Definitely Dan Kennedy proved he was ready to be the number one goalkeeper not just for Chivas USA, but the best in the league. The best game was probably getting the first win of the season at San Jose. To get the win and for it to be there, was a really good experience. What was the low point? Our defense. We thought with our coaching that they were going to be the strongest part of the team - but they were the weakest part. They were a real disappointment. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? I'm very happy with the players that we've got. A lot of impressive new faces - particularly the new South Americans Miller Bola\u00f1os and Oswaldo Minda. With Juan Pablo Angel staying another season, we're definitely going to have a stronger team than last year. We'll miss players like Justin Braun and Michael Uma\u00f1a, but a change was needed. What do you expect this season? I think the team will make the play-offs and have a chance to win the championship. A team needs a strong defense to win and that's what we'll have this year. Where will the team finish? I don't know if it will be 1, 2, 3 or 4. But we'll be top 4. Who will win the Western Conference? Going to be very tough this year - definitely should be LA (I'd like it to be Chivas USA). Who will win the MLS Cup? Get in the playoffs and anyone can win - Chivas USA! Colorado Rapids Todd Hagerty, Pid Army What was the highlight of 2011? It is hard to argue with the first home game of the 2011 season, when the MLS cup was paraded around the pitch. To top it off the Rapids then scored three goals in the first 30 minutes of their opening game as defending MLS Cup champions in a comprehensive thrashing of the Timbers. What was the low point? So many to choose from: Mullan's tackle on Zakuani; Conor Casey's injuries; Omar's disappearing act; the Champions League debacle; Gary Smith's public arguing with team management and subsequent departure. The 2011 season couldn't have been closer to an episode of Dream Team. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? Not much is known about draftee, Tony Caisco, but he should provide depth on the wings of new manager Oscar Pareja's 4-3-3 lineup. New signings Jaime Castrillon and Martin Rivero have many supporters drooling and should provide some attacking flair in Denver. What do you expect this season? I expect a more exciting and watchable team. Success depends on Conor Casey's return from injury and Omar's return to form. Where will the team finish? Despite all of the changes, the core of the 2010 championship team remains. That being said, the Western Conference is stacked - LA, RSL and Seattle are still legit and Vancouver, Portland and San Jose have made interesting additions. I think the Rapids experience will have them battling for 3rd or 4th in the Conference and another trip to the playoffs is on the cards. I think a championship is just a bit beyond them this year, but anything can happen in the playoffs. Who will win the Western Conference? The LA Gals ability to manipulate the salary cap make them the prohibitive favorites for the Western Conference and the Supporters Shield. Who will win the MLS Cup? The Galaxy will be tired come playoff time. The Rapids bid farewell to their long-time Captain, Pablo Mastroeni, and make it to the Cup final only to lose heroically to Sporting KC. FC Dallas Jon Beard, VP of Inferno What was the highlight of 2011? It's hard to argue against the history that FC Dallas made last season as being the highlight. People can talk about the quality of the opposition all they want, but the fact remains, and the record book will record, that FCD were the first ever MLS team to win a competitive game on Mexican soil - with a 1-0 victory over Pumas in Champions League play. The breakout play of Brek Shea and the way the team banded together to grind out results despite the loss of MVP David Ferreira, also rank up there. What was the low point? The team ended up running out of gas during the home stretch and unfortunately flamed out of CCL, the US Open Cup, and eventually the playoffs, to teams that they perhaps should have beaten, or at least had closer games against. However, I think a lot of FC Dallas fans, particularly those that have been around more than the last year or two, would agree that the death of Bobby Rhine (former player and commentator) was the biggest blow to the team. Bobby had been with the team his entire professional career, was a huge fan favorite and a big presence at the club. Besides the fans though, I think the team felt his loss more than they ever really admitted. . What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? At the beginning of the silly season, things didn't look so great, with a huge hole opening up at right mid with the losses of Marvin Chavez and Jackson, and at center back with George John looking to be on his way out. However, Schellas and his team have brought in some excellent cover at defense (something that was sorely lacking last season) in Hernan Pertuz, Matt Hedges and Carlos Rodriguez, and it appears that Andrew Wiedeman and Fabian Castillo are taking huge steps in proving why they should be the starting RM. The biggest deal is that the striker problem appears to be finally solved - Blas Perez should prove to be the target forward this club has been missing since Kenny Cooper left the club. What do you expect this season? I expect the club to do everything they can to make it back to CCL play next season. The US Open Cup should be a huge priority for this team this year, and now the format has changed, the competition should be very winnable. I'm also expecting a slow start to the season, with a lot of close, low-scoring games. The defense should be tight with Kevin Hartman, Ugo Ihemelu and Zach Loyd leading the way, but it may take a few weeks for Perez and Ferreira to fully gel as they both try to regain fitness. Where will the team finish? The West is once again looking to be the strongest of the two conferences, and it's hard to look past LA for the Supporters Shield. FCD should definitely be in the playoff mix however, it just remains to be seen where they, and the other likely front-runners, Salt Lake and Seattle, round out the season. There's no reason to think FCD can't make their second MLS cup final - with less fixture congestion and more depth, the team should be stronger and fitter in the home stretch, and will definitely be motivated to prove they can win it all after the disappointments of the last 2 years. Who will win the Western Conference? LA. That team is stacked. Who will win the MLS Cup? Post-season's always a crapshoot. Two years ago LA were supposed to win and Dallas beat them 3-0 in the playoffs. It just depends on who gets hot at the right time - I see no reason why it can't be Dallas. LA Galaxy Brian Lynch, Public Relations Representative, Angel City Brigade What was the highlight of 2011? Winning the MLS Cup in our home stadium was the highlight, of course! Our CONCACAF Champions League win at home against Morelia was an easy number two - people who were there will remember that night for a long, long time. Juninho's last second goal, in front of a small but raucous crowd, to put us through to the CCL quarterfinals, was simply mesmerizing. What was the low point? Early in the season when Leonardo, a young, promising center back from Brazil injured his knee and was declared out for the season we were a little demoralized. We had already lost Edson Buddle to Germany and Juan Pablo Angel wasn't fitting into the team as well as we would have liked. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? We honestly couldn't be happier with our off season - with one major exception. We essentially have our team back and with the acquisition of Marcelo Sarvas and the \"re-acquisition\" of Edson Buddle we're looking to have a very potent offense. The loss of Omar Gonzalez is huge however and we're a little thin at center back, but we're looking forward to Leonardo coming back from injury soon. What do you expect this season? Our toughest, and arguably our most important, goal is to win the CONCACAF Champions League. It's a goal not only for the Galaxy and the supporters, but for Major League Soccer as a whole. There is a big push now to become the best league in North America and winning the CCL will be a huge step in that direction. Of course we're also looking for our third consecutive Supporters Shield and second consecutive MLS Cup. What position will the team finish in? We should finish first in the Western Conference and first in MLS, although with the unbalanced schedule it will be more difficult for a Western team to be the points winner then it has been for the past two years. With Portland and Vancouver making significant additions there are 5 or 6 teams in the West that are very high quality. Who will win the Western Conference? LA. Who will win the MLS Cup? LA. Portland Timbers Roger Anthony, The 107ist What was the highlight of 2011? A dominating, delirious 3-0 win over the eventual champion Galaxy on Aug. 3. The Timbers were a much more competitive side from that point on. . What was the low point? As a first-year expansion team, you expect matches like the dreadful 0-4 \"Debacle in Dallas\" on June 25. The real low point was the six weeks between May 29 and July 10 that saw the club concede late goals in four out of five home matches. All told, that cost the club at least five points during an inaugural season in which they fell four points short of a playoff spot. Beyond that, pick almost any road match - the club won only two away contests. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? Most of the effort went into retooling the attack. American striker Kenny Cooper, who closed with a rush last season, was sent to New York to make room for former Rangers player Kris Boyd. Two other high-profile signings joined up: The injured Jose Adolfo Valencia and Barca academy grad Franck Songo'o. The famously devoted fans of the Timbers Army are excited. But little was done on the back end, though Colombian CB Hanyer Mosquera is a welcome addition. The four returning fullbacks \u2013 Rodney Wallace, Mike Chabala, Steve Purdy and Lovel Palmer \u2013 personify inconsistency. Devoted fans of the Timbers Army are curious \u2013 and scouring the internet for word about the future of Colombian fullback Juan David Duque. What do you expect this season? First of all, more possession. Even by the standards of a first-year side, the Timbers spent an awful lot of time chasing and defending. Still, with the uptick during the second half of last season \u2013 Portland won four and drew four of its final 10 matches \u2013 a playoff spot seems reachable. Where will the team finish? This year's unbalanced schedule, in which teams play 24 of 34 matches against divisional foes, is going to make it tough for Portland, as the balance of power in MLS remains in the Western Conference. Los Angeles, Seattle and Salt Lake are still out of reach; so the Timbers are in a second-tier scrum with Colorado, Dallas and perhaps Chivas. Pencil in Portland for fifth in the West and 11th overall. Who will win the Western Conference? LA. Who will win the MLS Cup? I'd hate to be drummed out of the corps, but Seattle's overdue a win. Real Salt Lake Denzel Eslinger, Editor, RSL Soapbox What was the highlight of 2011? Clearly the highlight was making it to the final of the CONCACAF Champions League - being the first MLS team to do so, with the new format, was a huge accomplishment for RSL. What was the low point? Losing in the 2nd leg (at home) of the CCL final, after fighting hard for a 2-2 draw on the road against Monterrey. To come home and lose 1-0 - our first loss at Rio Tinto in over a year (37 matches in all competitions) - was heartbreaking. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? This was the first time in 5 years that RSL made more than just minor moves in the off-season. 9 players left the team, but a number of new faces are joining. I think the biggest losses will be Andy Williams and Robbie Russell - both played big roles with the team over the last few years. The biggest gains appear to be Enzo Martinez, and getting a healthy Javier Morales back to the squad. What do you expect this season? I expect a very solid season from RSL. They have set their goal to get back to the knockout rounds of the CONCACAF Champions League. To get there they will really need to get a lot out of their new and younger players, as the veteran depth is gone this year. Where will the team finish? I think RSL will battle for 2nd place in the Western Conference with Seattle and likely FC Dallas - everyone will be trying to catch the LA Galaxy. This year MLS has made big changes to the playoffs. I expect RSL will qualify for them and hopefully be able to play host to MLS Cup on December 1st. Who will win the Western Conference? LA. Who will win the MLS Cup? RSL. San Jose Earthquakes Donald Rickard, Board Member, San Jose Casbah What was the highlight of 2011? The first highlight of 2011 was our first home game of the season (even though we lost) - which has been dubbed \"the Great Deluge\" by San Jose fans. It poured the entire game and only the hardcore fans stuck around. The other highlight would be our game at Stanford Stadium, where there were over 40,000 fans there to watch a great game. What was the low point? The low point was our 13 game winless streak in the middle of the season. It was very very tough to watch, but we were finally able to bury the streak. What do you think of the off-season trades? I think we have had one of the best off seasons of all teams. We have brought in players to fill all of the major holes from last season. I am especially happy that we were able to bring back Dawkins for the season. When Dawkins and Wondo are working together they do some amazing give and goes. What do you expect this season? I, like every other fan, has high expectations for their team. I honestly believe we can be a dark horse for the MLS Cup since many are not expecting it, while we have silently stacked our team. Where will the team finish? I believe we will be top 3 in the west and will make a far run in the playoffs. Who will win the Western Conference? I hate to say it, but LA. Who will win the MLS Cup? RSL or Seattle. Seattle Sounders Samuel Chesneau, Gorilla FC member What was the highlight of 2011? The highlight of 2011 would probably be a toss up between winning our 3rd consecutive US Open cup in as many seasons and our tribute game (att. 64,120) against the San Jose Earthquakes to a national and local icon in US Soccer, Kasey Keller. . What was the low point? The low point was losing to Real Salt Lake in the playoffs. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? The Sounders unloaded a lot of the high salary veterans that didn't seem to get much playing time or production, replacing them with younger foreign talent (Sivebaek, Johansson, Cato) - and then shocked the supporters base by unloading a fan favorite (Fucito) and a local talent (Neagle) for Eddie Johnson, right before the season started. This move showed that the front office wants to win NOW and will take the risks necessary to do so. Whether or not the big trade pans out remains to be seen, but the staff clearly will do whatever it takes to overtake the LA Galaxy. What do you expect this season? I expect much more of the same, minus the slow start like last year: high scoring offense and a solid defense; more record crowds and a continuous improvement. I believe the Sounders and LA Galaxy will, like last year, distance themselves from the rest of the West early. Where will the team finish? With all sincerity, the only team we have to answer to is the defending champion Galaxy, and believe the front office made the moves necessary to ensure we will do that. I expect the Sounders will advance to another US Open Cup final and the quarterfinals of CONCACAF Champions League. Anything less than a Supporters Shield &amp; an MLS Cup would be a disappointment. This is our year to get the treble! Who will win the Western Conference? Seattle. Who will win the MLS Cup? Seattle. Vancouver Whitecaps Brenton Walters, Director of External Communications, Vancouver Southsiders What was the highlight of 2011? Opening day was magical. We beat Toronto 4-2 under sunny skies, with our new DP Eric Hassli scoring twice. Hassli's wonder goal in Seattle, to tie the game, is a close second. What was the low point? Opening our new stadium with a 0-1 loss to Cascadia rivals Portland. It felt like we had lost our last opportunity to salvage anything from our season. What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts? Our new coach, Martin Rennie, has been very active in the off-season, and has put together an exciting team, with Sebastian Le Toux the obvious stand-out. What do you expect this season? After a disappointing inaugural MLS season, we'd like to win the Voyageur's Cup, finally get a win on the road, and get more fans on their feet and chanting. Where will the team finish? 6th in the difficult Western Conference and 12th overall. We're bullish, given the dramatic moves by Rennie and the club. Who will win the Western Conference? LA. (Seattle if Eddie Johnson starts well). Who will win the MLS Cup? LA. Eastern Conference: the Guardian view Western Conference: the Guardian view Eastern Conference: the fans' view",

      "body": "<p>In the final round of previews for the 2012 MLS season we ask Western Conference fans about their memories of last year and hopes and predictions for the coming campaign.</p> <p><em>Warning: may contain bias.</em></p> <h2>Chivas USA</h2> <p>Julio Ramos, \"Chivas Mayor\", <a href=\"http://www.unionultras.com/\">Union Ultras</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>Definitely Dan Kennedy proved he was ready to be the number one goalkeeper not just for Chivas USA, but the best in the league. The best game was probably getting the first win of the season at San Jose. To get the win and for it to be there, was a really good experience.</p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>Our defense. We thought with our coaching that they were going to be the strongest part of the team - but they were the weakest part. They were a real disappointment.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>I'm very happy with the players that we've got. A lot of impressive new faces - particularly the new South Americans Miller Bola\u00f1os and Oswaldo Minda. With Juan Pablo Angel staying another season, we're definitely going to have a stronger team than last year. We'll miss players like Justin Braun and Michael Uma\u00f1a, but a change was needed.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>I think the team will make the play-offs and have a chance to win the championship. A team needs a strong defense to win and that's what we'll have this year.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>I don't know if it will be 1, 2, 3 or 4. But we'll be top 4.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Western Conference?</strong><br>Going to be very tough this year - definitely should be LA (I'd like it to be Chivas USA).</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>Get in the playoffs and anyone can win - Chivas USA!</p> <h2>Colorado Rapids</h2> <p>Todd Hagerty, <a href=\"http://www.pidarmy.com/Pid_Army/Home.html\">Pid Army</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>It is hard to argue with the first home game of the 2011 season, when the MLS cup was paraded around the pitch. To top it off the Rapids then scored three goals in the first 30 minutes of their opening game as defending MLS Cup champions in a comprehensive thrashing of the Timbers.</p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>So many to choose from: Mullan's tackle on Zakuani; Conor Casey's injuries; Omar's disappearing act; the Champions League debacle; Gary Smith's public arguing with team management and subsequent departure. The 2011 season couldn't have been closer to an episode of <a href=\"http://www.harchester.net/\">Dream Team</a>.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>Not much is known about draftee, Tony Caisco, but he should provide depth on the wings of new manager Oscar Pareja's 4-3-3 lineup. New signings Jaime Castrillon and Martin Rivero have many supporters drooling and should provide some attacking flair in Denver.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>I expect a more exciting and watchable team. Success depends on Conor Casey's return from injury and Omar's return to form.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>Despite all of the changes, the core of the 2010 championship team remains. That being said, the Western Conference is stacked - LA, RSL and Seattle are still legit and Vancouver, Portland and San Jose have made interesting additions. I think the Rapids experience will have them battling for 3rd or 4th in the Conference and another trip to the playoffs is on the cards. I think a championship is just a bit beyond them this year, but anything can happen in the playoffs.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Western Conference?</strong><br>The LA Gals ability to manipulate the salary cap make them the prohibitive favorites for the Western Conference and the Supporters Shield.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>The Galaxy will be tired come playoff time. The Rapids bid farewell to their long-time Captain, Pablo Mastroeni, and make it to the Cup final only to lose heroically to Sporting KC.</p> <h2>FC Dallas</h2> <p>Jon Beard, VP of <a href=\"http://www.the-inferno.net/\">Inferno</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>It's hard to argue against the history that FC Dallas made last season as being the highlight. People can talk about the quality of the opposition all they want, but the fact remains, and the record book will record, that FCD were the first ever MLS team to win a competitive game on Mexican soil - with a 1-0 victory over Pumas in Champions League play. The breakout play of Brek Shea and the way the team banded together to grind out results despite the loss of MVP David Ferreira, also rank up there.</p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>The team ended up running out of gas during the home stretch and unfortunately flamed out of CCL, the US Open Cup, and eventually the playoffs, to teams that they perhaps should have beaten, or at least had closer games against. However, I think a lot of FC Dallas fans, particularly those that have been around more than the last year or two, would agree that the death of Bobby Rhine (former player and commentator) was the biggest blow to the team. Bobby had been with the team his entire professional career, was a huge fan favorite and a big presence at the club. Besides the fans though, I think the team felt his loss more than they ever really admitted.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XsN8JwUAHXQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XsN8JwUAHXQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.<br><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>At the beginning of the silly season, things didn't look so great, with a huge hole opening up at right mid with the losses of Marvin Chavez and Jackson, and at center back with George John looking to be on his way out. However, Schellas and his team have brought in some excellent cover at defense (something that was sorely lacking last season) in Hernan Pertuz, Matt Hedges and Carlos Rodriguez, and it appears that Andrew Wiedeman and Fabian Castillo are taking huge steps in proving why they should be the starting RM. The biggest deal is that the striker problem appears to be finally solved - Blas Perez should prove to be the target forward this club has been missing since Kenny Cooper left the club.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>I expect the club to do everything they can to make it back to CCL play next season. The US Open Cup should be a huge priority for this team this year, and now the format has changed, the competition should be very winnable. I'm also expecting a slow start to the season, with a lot of close, low-scoring games. The defense should be tight with Kevin Hartman, Ugo Ihemelu and Zach Loyd leading the way, but it may take a few weeks for Perez and Ferreira to fully gel as they both try to regain fitness.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>The West is once again looking to be the strongest of the two conferences, and it's hard to look past LA for the Supporters Shield. FCD should definitely be in the playoff mix however, it just remains to be seen where they, and the other likely front-runners, Salt Lake and Seattle, round out the season. There's no reason to think FCD can't make their second MLS cup final - with less fixture congestion and more depth, the team should be stronger and fitter in the home stretch, and will definitely be motivated to prove they can win it all after the disappointments of the last 2 years.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Western Conference?</strong><br>LA. That team is stacked.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>Post-season's always a crapshoot. Two years ago LA were supposed to win and Dallas beat them 3-0 in the playoffs. It just depends on who gets hot at the right time - I see no reason why it can't be Dallas.</p> <h2>LA Galaxy</h2> <p>Brian Lynch, Public Relations Representative, <a href=\"http://angelcitybrigade.net/\">Angel City Brigade</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>Winning the MLS Cup in our home stadium was the highlight, of course! Our CONCACAF Champions League win at home against Morelia was an easy number two - people who were there will remember that night for a long, long time. Juninho's last second goal, in front of a small but raucous crowd, to put us through to the CCL quarterfinals, was simply mesmerizing.</p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>Early in the season when Leonardo, a young, promising center back from Brazil injured his knee and was declared out for the season we were a little demoralized. We had already lost Edson Buddle to Germany and Juan Pablo Angel wasn't fitting into the team as well as we would have liked.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>We honestly couldn't be happier with our off season - with one major exception. We essentially have our team back and with the acquisition of Marcelo Sarvas and the \"re-acquisition\" of Edson Buddle we're looking to have a very potent offense. The loss of Omar Gonzalez is huge however and we're a little thin at center back, but we're looking forward to Leonardo coming back from injury soon.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>Our toughest, and arguably our most important, goal is to win the CONCACAF Champions League. It's a goal not only for the Galaxy and the supporters, but for Major League Soccer as a whole. There is a big push now to become the best league in North America and winning the CCL will be a huge step in that direction. Of course we're also looking for our third consecutive Supporters Shield and second consecutive MLS Cup.</p> <p><strong>What position will the team finish in?</strong><br>We should finish first in the Western Conference and first in MLS, although with the unbalanced schedule it will be more difficult for a Western team to be the points winner then it has been for the past two years. With Portland and Vancouver making significant additions there are 5 or 6 teams in the West that are very high quality.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Western Conference?</strong><br>LA.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>LA.</p> <h2>Portland Timbers</h2> <p>Roger Anthony, <a href=\"http://timbersarmy.org/\">The 107ist</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>A dominating, delirious 3-0 win over the eventual champion Galaxy on Aug. 3. The Timbers were a much more competitive side from that point on.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9w9U_CwBr4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9w9U_CwBr4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.<br><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>As a first-year expansion team, you expect matches like the dreadful 0-4 \"Debacle in Dallas\" on June 25. The real low point was the six weeks between May 29 and July 10 that saw the club concede late goals in four out of five home matches. All told, that cost the club at least five points during an inaugural season in which they fell four points short of a playoff spot. Beyond that, pick almost any road match - the club won only two away contests.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>Most of the effort went into retooling the attack. American striker Kenny Cooper, who closed with a rush last season, was sent to New York to make room for former Rangers player Kris Boyd. Two other high-profile signings joined up: The injured Jose Adolfo Valencia and Barca academy grad Franck Songo'o. The famously devoted fans of the Timbers Army are excited. But little was done on the back end, though Colombian CB Hanyer Mosquera is a welcome addition. The four returning fullbacks \u2013 Rodney Wallace, Mike Chabala, Steve Purdy and Lovel Palmer \u2013 personify inconsistency. Devoted fans of the Timbers Army are curious \u2013 and scouring the internet for word about the future of Colombian fullback Juan David Duque.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>First of all, more possession. Even by the standards of a first-year side, the Timbers spent an awful lot of time chasing and defending. Still, with the uptick during the second half of last season \u2013 Portland won four and drew four of its final 10 matches \u2013 a playoff spot seems reachable.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>This year's unbalanced schedule, in which teams play 24 of 34 matches against divisional foes, is going to make it tough for Portland, as the balance of power in MLS remains in the Western Conference. Los Angeles, Seattle and Salt Lake are still out of reach; so the Timbers are in a second-tier scrum with Colorado, Dallas and perhaps Chivas. Pencil in Portland for fifth in the West and 11th overall.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Western Conference?</strong><br>LA.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>I'd hate to be drummed out of the corps, but Seattle's overdue a win.</p> <h2>Real Salt Lake</h2> <p>Denzel Eslinger, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.rslsoapbox.com/\">RSL Soapbox</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>Clearly the highlight was making it to the final of the CONCACAF Champions League - being the first MLS team to do so, with the new format, was a huge accomplishment for RSL.</p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>Losing in the 2nd leg (at home) of the CCL final, after fighting hard for a 2-2 draw on the road against Monterrey. To come home and lose 1-0 - our first loss at Rio Tinto in over a year (37 matches in all competitions) - was heartbreaking.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>This was the first time in 5 years that RSL made more than just minor moves in the off-season. 9 players left the team, but a number of new faces are joining. I think the biggest losses will be Andy Williams and Robbie Russell - both played big roles with the team over the last few years. The biggest gains appear to be Enzo Martinez, and getting a healthy Javier Morales back to the squad.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>I expect a very solid season from RSL. They have set their goal to get back to the knockout rounds of the CONCACAF Champions League. To get there they will really need to get a lot out of their new and younger players, as the veteran depth is gone this year.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>I think RSL will battle for 2nd place in the Western Conference with Seattle and likely FC Dallas - everyone will be trying to catch the LA Galaxy. This year MLS has made big changes to the playoffs. I expect RSL will qualify for them and hopefully be able to play host to MLS Cup on December 1st.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Western Conference?</strong><br>LA.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>RSL.</p> <h2>San Jose Earthquakes</h2> <p>Donald Rickard, Board Member, <a href=\"http://www.sjcasbah.com/\">San Jose Casbah</a></p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>The first highlight of 2011 was our first home game of the season (even though we lost) - which has been dubbed \"the Great Deluge\" by San Jose fans. It poured the entire game and only the hardcore fans stuck around. The other highlight would be our game at Stanford Stadium, where there were over 40,000 fans there to watch a great game.</p> <p><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>The low point was our 13 game winless streak in the middle of the season. It was very very tough to watch, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hTz7oJcQaio\">we were finally able to bury the streak</a>.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades?</strong><br>I think we have had one of the best off seasons of all teams. We have brought in players to fill all of the major holes from last season. I am especially happy that we were able to bring back Dawkins for the season. When Dawkins and Wondo are working together they do some amazing give and goes.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>I, like every other fan, has high expectations for their team. I honestly believe we can be a dark horse for the MLS Cup since many are not expecting it, while we have silently stacked our team.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>I believe we will be top 3 in the west and will make a far run in the playoffs.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the Western Conference?</strong><br>I hate to say it, but LA.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the MLS Cup?</strong><br>RSL or Seattle.</p> <h2>Seattle Sounders</h2> <p>Samuel Chesneau, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a> member</p> <p><strong>What was the highlight of 2011?</strong><br>The highlight of 2011 would probably be a toss up between winning our 3rd consecutive US Open cup in as many seasons and our tribute game (att. 64,120) against the San Jose Earthquakes to a national and local icon in US Soccer, Kasey Keller.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sscwZ8_JWo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sscwZ8_JWo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.<br><strong>What was the low point?</strong><br>The low point was losing to Real Salt Lake in the playoffs.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the off-season trades/drafts?</strong><br>The Sounders unloaded a lot of the high salary veterans that didn't seem to get much playing time or production, replacing them with younger foreign talent (Sivebaek, Johansson, Cato) - and then shocked the supporters base by unloading a fan favorite (Fucito) and a local talent (Neagle) for Eddie Johnson, right before the season started. This move showed that the front office wants to win NOW and will take the risks necessary to do so. Whether or not the big trade pans out remains to be seen, but the staff clearly will do whatever it takes to overtake the LA Galaxy.</p> <p><strong>What do you expect this season?</strong><br>I expect much more of the same, minus the slow start like last year: high scoring offense and a solid defense; more record crowds and a continuous improvement. I believe the Sounders and LA Galaxy will, like last year, distance themselves from the rest of the West early.</p> <p><strong>Where will the team finish?</strong><br>With all sincerity, the only team we have to answer to is the defending champion Galaxy, and believe the front office made the moves necessary to ensure we will do that. I expect the Sounders will advance to another US Open Cup final and the quarterfinals of CONCACAF Champions League. Anything less than a Supporters Shield &amp; an MLS Cup would be a disappointment.

      "bodyText": "Working closely with New York's Whitney Museum of American Art, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts has put together a retrospective devoted to Lyonel Feininger. Unlike the Whitney exhibition last year, which focused exclusively on his paintings, the Montreal show looks at the artist's whole career, with illustrations, drawings, paintings, engravings, photographs and music. \"He was one of the 20th century's greatest artists,\" says Whitney curator Barbara Haskell, who supervised the catalogue for both shows. The broad reach of Feininger's work is reflected in the design of the exhibition itself, moving from the turbulent world of the 1920s, through a series of highly coloured paintings, to a large room evoking the purity of the Bauhaus aesthetic, and thence to a music room, which highlights the importance of music in his work. Concurrently a series of concerts explores Feininger and the art of the fugue. Some 350 works by Feininger are on show in Montreal, almost twice as many as in New York, presented in a very different way, according to Nathalie Bondil, the museum's head. Feininger: From Manhattan to the Bauhaus is divided into five parts, starting with drawings and caricatures from Feininger's youth. He was born in New York in 1871 but left for Germany aged 18, starting a successful career as an illustrator and cartoonist, working in Hamburg, Berlin and Paris, as well as the city of his birth. He sketched Parisians in the street and architectural details, but above all published a large number of cartoons in German and US newspapers and magazines. The second part of the exhibition (1907-18) opens with his early attempts at painting, in particular in Paris. Oils on canvas, such as Lecteurs de Journaux, depict a carnival world with larger-than-life figures, or pedestrians and cyclists in motion in a cameo of vibrant loud colours. The oblique perspective and distorted scale are a foretaste of Feininger's subsequent encounter with cubism, at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, where he showed six paintings in 1911. Feininger joined the German avant garde \u2013 Klee, Kandinsky, Franz Marc \u2013 but the paintings in Montreal show that he eschewed the colours of expressionism, preferring shades of grey to achieve volume, with geometrical planes set at various angles as in his Gables series. Surfaces overlap or merge, producing a prismatic effect. In contrast, other works are full of lively colours, as in his Jesuits series or his superb Yellow Street II. Also displayed here are wooden toys that Feininger made for his children. The exhibition pays particular attention to the 1920s, when Feininger became a leading light in the Bauhaus movement. He headed the graphic printing workshop at the school while also composing music. He found time to paint \u2013 works inspired by architecture or nature, such as Clouds Above the Sea, are from this period. He also indulged in photography. While his pictures are workaday, the show also contains 70 photographs by his son Andreas, taken from a collection recently donated to the museum. Apart from their intrinsic artistic value they throw light on the period starting in 1925 when the family moved to Dessau, home to the Bauhaus. The next part focuses on the rise of Nazism and Feininger's return in 1937, aged 66, to New York, shortly before he was classified as a \"degenerate\" artist by the German authorities.

      "body": "<p>Working closely with New York's <a href=\"http://whitney.org/\" title=\"\">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/index.html\" title=\"\">Montreal Museum of Fine Arts</a> has put together a retrospective devoted to <a href=\"http://www.lyonel-feininger.com/\" title=\"\">Lyonel Feininger</a>. Unlike the Whitney exhibition last year, which focused exclusively on his paintings, the Montreal show looks at the artist's whole career, with illustrations, drawings, paintings, engravings, photographs and music. \"He was one of the 20th century's greatest artists,\" says Whitney curator Barbara Haskell, who supervised the catalogue for both shows.</p> <p>The broad reach of Feininger's work is reflected in the design of the exhibition itself, moving from the turbulent world of the 1920s, through a series of highly coloured paintings, to a large room evoking the purity of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus\" title=\"\">Bauhaus</a> aesthetic, and thence to a music room, which highlights the importance of music in his work. Concurrently a series of concerts explores Feininger and the art of the fugue. Some 350 works by Feininger are on show in Montreal, almost twice as many as in New York, presented in a very different way, according to Nathalie Bondil, the museum's head.</p> <p>Feininger: From Manhattan to the Bauhaus is divided into five parts, starting with drawings and caricatures from Feininger's youth. He was born in New York in 1871 but left for Germany aged 18, starting a successful career as an illustrator and cartoonist, working in Hamburg, Berlin and Paris, as well as the city of his birth. He sketched Parisians in the street and architectural details, but above all published a large number of cartoons in German and US newspapers and magazines.</p> <p>The second part of the exhibition (1907-18) opens with his early attempts at painting, in particular in Paris. Oils on canvas, such as Lecteurs de Journaux, depict a carnival world with larger-than-life figures, or pedestrians and cyclists in motion in a cameo of vibrant loud colours. The oblique perspective and distorted scale are a foretaste of Feininger's subsequent encounter with cubism, at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, where he showed six paintings in 1911.</p> <p>Feininger joined the German avant garde \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/klee\" title=\"\">Klee</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kandinsky\" title=\"\">Kandinsky</a>, Franz Marc \u2013 but the paintings in Montreal show that he eschewed the colours of expressionism, preferring shades of grey to achieve volume, with geometrical planes set at various angles as in his Gables series. Surfaces overlap or merge, producing a prismatic effect. In contrast, other works are full of lively colours, as in his Jesuits series or his superb Yellow Street II. Also displayed here are wooden toys that Feininger made for his children.</p> <p>The exhibition pays particular attention to the 1920s, when Feininger became a leading light in the Bauhaus movement. He headed the graphic printing workshop at the school while also composing music. He found time to paint \u2013 works inspired by architecture or nature, such as Clouds Above the Sea, are from this period.</p> <p>He also indulged in photography. While his pictures are workaday, the show also contains 70 photographs by his son Andreas, taken from a collection recently donated to the museum. Apart from their intrinsic artistic value they throw light on the period starting in 1925 when the family moved to Dessau, home to the Bauhaus.</p> <p>The next part focuses on the rise of Nazism and Feininger's return in 1937, aged 66, to New York, shortly before he was classified as a \"degenerate\" artist by the German authorities. In the 1940-50s he painted Manhattan streets and bridges, trains, steamships and sailing boats, using watercolours or oils.</p> <p>This section concludes with the marvellous music room, which centres on the artist's violin.

      "bodyText": "The road from Cairo to Alexandria is lined with mega-farms growing strawberries, mangos and citrus fruit bound for foreign shores. In what was desert just decades ago, luxury produce now sprouts from the ground. The greening of this arid landscape was part of ambitious government plans to sustainably increase Egypt's cultivated territory by turning swaths of sand into fertile earth. Water and other resources, which had sustained generations of farmers, were diverted away from the fields of the Nile Valley. \"But it's not a question of just putting water on the desert and making it bloom,\" says Richard Tutwiler, director of the Desert Development Centre at the American University in Cairo. \"It takes a lot to make sand fertile.\" It took the construction of canals from the river to carry billions of cubic metres of water and tonnes of fertiliser to make the desert green, and, Tutwiler says, \"most of the expenses were incurred by the government\". Eventually Egypt increased its cultivated land by one-quarter, and, in turn, the amount of food it produces. Despite this, most Egyptians still survive on cheap bread, not strawberries, and the country consumes near double the amount of wheat per capita as Italy. With a population of 85 million, Egyptians eat 15m tonnes of the grain each year. In the 1960s Egypt grew enough wheat to feed its population of 26 million on the 3.5% of its land \u2013 lining the banks of the Nile and north coast \u2013 that is naturally arable. While the amount of cultivated land has increased by a quarter, the area seeded with wheat has decreased, and Egypt is now the world's largest importer of the grain, buying 10m tonnes per year from the volatile international food markets. Steered by the liberalisation schemes of the US Agency for International Development and the IMF in 1990s, Egypt implemented a plan to transform its farming sector from domestic supplier to competitive exporter. Some say this has come at the cost of food security. Instead of seeding the newly greened desert with staple crops and affordable produce, most of this reclaimed land was given to businessmen who cultivated cash crops for export. In theory, the money earned from these exports would be used to buy less expensive goods, such as wheat, on the international market, while also creating jobs. Instead, investors built heavily mechanised mega-farms, providing few jobs and little food for domestic consumption. At the same time, allegations emerged that some international loans were being diverted away from development work. \"The economy at large was growing but it was not trickling down,\" says Magda Kandil, of the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies. \"The intention was to increase growth, and we did, but in the absence of regulation corruption prevailed and it made this growth very much clustered among a few individuals.\" Under Hosni Mubarak's regime, corruption \u2013 much of which involved land deals \u2013 combined with aggressive economic liberalisation to favour the business class. This contributed to already increasing economic disparity, pushing the number of Egyptians who live on less than $2 a day to over 40%, from about 20% in 1999. When former Egyptian agriculture minister Yousef Wali was arrested in his Cairo villa last July, he joined other former officials to be detained and charged since Mubarak's ousting. Wali is charged with illegally selling government land in a 2006 deal that saw thousands of hectares of public land near Luxor transferred into the hands of a businessman close to Mubarak. Farmers' unions, meanwhile, have been weakened to the point of futility, says Adel William, founder of Sons of the Soil, an organisation of farmers who joined anti-government protests last year. \"We cannot even fight for our rights because we are not allowed to organise,\" he says. The previous government offered minimal support to farmers, William says. Egypt's agricultural subsidies are meagre, equalling 2% of national farm receipts, compared to OECD countries, whose subsidies average around 30%. Millions gave up on the land and searched for urban wages. A quarter of Egyptians who now live in cities were born in rural areas, says Ayman Zohry, president of the Egyptian Society for Migration Studies. Sami Saleh is among the near 5 million people to migrate to Cairo. He once grew wheat and corn on his family's land in Fayoum, about 130km southwest of the capital. Now, the 41-year-old father of four works as a labourer and night watchman at a construction site. \"The fertiliser and water became too expensive and too scarce and the profits too little,\" says Saleh, standing outside the one-room, plywood shack where he now lives with his family. His monthly income of $80 is not enough to feed his family a simple diet of fava beans, bread and vegetables. Saleh says he borrows money to put food on the table. Like 80% of Egyptians, Saleh and his family depend on subsidised bread. These subsidies cost the government as much as $2.3bn per year. To mitigate this expense, the government paid farmers too little for their wheat, says Kandil. Many farmers could not make a profit and stopped planting Egypt's staple grain. The amount of land dedicated to growing wheat shrank, while the demand continued to increase and Egypt went from self-sufficiency to importing 60% of its wheat, hooking it into the unstable international market and eroding food security. In the end it was skyrocketing global wheat prices that exposed the flaw in the system. The international market price of wheat doubled between 2006 and 2008 and the cost of bread jumped when the Egyptian government didn't increase grain subsides to cover the difference. Riots broke out in bread lines and at least five Egyptians died in clashes. When protesters took to the streets of Egypt in January 2010, they had three key demands: \"Bread, Freedom and Justice.\" While none have been delivered, food prices have increased, putting basic staples out of reach for even more Egyptians. \"Clearly there should be an incentive system in place. Food security has become a dominant factor in domestic issues in Egypt,\" Kandil says. \"We will never get to a point where we are completely self-sufficient, but we need to moderate the risk going forward.\"",

      "bodyText": "China has grown increasingly friendly towards Europe as the EU's sovereign debt crisis unfolds, and it is gently but steadily advancing its pawns in the single market. There are still few Chinese-owned factories in Europe, but Beijing has been advancing its interests over the last three years. China first focused its attention on Greece, the aim being to make Piraeus, in the Athens suburbs, the main point for goods entering the European market. The port is now dominated by the China Ocean Shipping Company (Cosco), which has been operating two terminals there since 2009. In 2010 Prime Minister Wen Jiabao kicked off a European visit there, meeting policy makers and business leaders from France, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, and above all from Greece. Since Cosco's arrival in Greece, exports to China have increased by 50%. Beijing wants to step up investments in the country, in particular in telecommunications, banking, car manufacture, railway infrastructure, property, catering, electronics, textiles and glass. But as well as investments linked to Greece's current financial woes \u2013 with central banks offering risky, but high-yield bonds \u2013 or company takeovers, the Chinese are keen to locate production facilities on the European mainland. Last month the car manufacturer Great Wall Motors fired up an assembly line in Bulgaria. \"It's the first Chinese car factory to produce in Europe for Europe,\" said an executive from the firm's Bulgarian partner company. As yet there are no Chinese production plants in France but there are plans to open a Franco-Chinese business park near Ch\u00e2teauroux, in western France. It will specialise in assembling parts and sub-systems manufactured at low cost in China. Thanks to this partnership, goods will qualify for a \"Made in Europe\" label, thought to be more reassuring than its Chinese counterpart. These \"companies must remedy the poor or nonexistent brand recognition they enjoy abroad,\" urged a report published in 2009 by France's economy, industry and employment ministry, \"and build an image for quality thanks to products at least as good as those of European or foreign competitors already operating in Europe. They need to rise above the often negative image associated with their goods, particularly as European consumers tend to assume low prices go hand in hand with poor quality.\" Herv\u00e9 Solignac Lecomte, head of international trade at HSBC France, endorses this view. \"Chinese companies want to dispel the 'low-grade' image of their manufactured goods. So they are trying to improve their position in the value chain by relocating all or part of their output in Europe,\" he says. Chinese manufacturers had suffered some serious setbacks before starting production in Europe. In 2011 Poland tore up a contract with China Overseas Engineering Group Co Ltd for the construction of a motorway between Warsaw and Berlin, only a year after the start of the project. The Polish public works department cited \"delays\" to explain its decision. Now instead of just operating as the workshop of the world, while staying at a safe distance from the markets \u2013 and consumers \u2013 it wants to win over, China is rethinking its strategy. \"GWM's Bulgarian plant is located close to potential customers and distribution channels,\" Lecomte explains. This is borne out by China's determination \"to invest primarily in sectors that will boost its foreign trade, but also facilitate international trade in general, areas such as air, rail and sea transport, infrastructure, and the associated logistics services and storage facilities,\" Lecomte adds. \"China wants to secure multiple points of access to Europe for its products. It's a more proactive and potentially less costly strategy, particularly with the high price of oil, which substantially adds to the cost of freight,\" Lecomte says. France has adopted the same approach by relocating vehicle production to Morocco. While companies may relocate production facilities, the centre of operations has remains fixed. \"The [regional] headquarters of Chinese firms are often located in London, which is Europe's main financial centre. But decisions are still taken in China and the system is still centralised. The yardstick is always the company at home in China,\" Lecomte says. \"We are currently seeing the installation of Chinese production units in Europe,\" he adds. \"But I think that ultimately China will set up more integrated facilities here, with decision-making powers as well as production.\" This article originally appeared in Le Monde Banking on Europe Great Wall Motors and its Bulgarian counterpart Litex launched production of three models at their Bahovitsa plant last month. GWM aims to manufacture 50,000 vehicles a year there. For now the factory is forecasting \"several thousand\" city cars, saloons and pick-ups, with prices ranging from \u20ac8,200 to \u20ac14,600 ($10,800 to $19,270). The parts will be imported from China and assembled in Bulgaria, permitting duty-free access to the European market. Just as western manufacturers want a share of the oriental cake, their Chinese counterparts are queuing up to locate to Europe. The GWM factory is not the first Chinese plant in Europe. MG, which was bought up by Nanjing-SAIC in 2005, assembles its MG TF and MG6 models at Longbridge in the UK. Similarly the Chinese manufacturer Geely, which bought Volvo and Manganese Bronze in 2010, is now rolling out its EC7 saloon. General Motors baulked at selling Opel and Saab to Chinese firms, respectively BAIC in 2009, and Pang Da and Youngman in 2011. But the latter may sale now go ahead as the Swedish brand is in receivership. By the end of 2012 DR Motors of Italy aims to produce Chery models at Fiat's former factory in Sicily. In partnership with Israel Corp, the same Chinese company is developing a new brand, Qoros, for European markets. Philippe Jacqu\u00e9 Le Monde",

      "bodyText": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that the media, in general, could do a better job of reporting science. There are plenty of good journalists out there, of course, carefully choosing stories, applying the filters of context, analysis and accuracy and working to ensure stories that contain science \u2013 ranging from lifestyle to politics and way beyond \u2013 get due prominence in newspapers, magazines, websites and blogs. And there are plenty of good scientists who engage, debate and contribute to the same exercise, albeit necessarily with different intents and from a different point of view. But there's a long way to go before anyone could feasibly argue that science is used and understood well by the general media \u2013 Ben Goldacre has plenty of grist for his mill yet. Whose job is it, though, to make things better? I'd argue it's the responsibility of anyone who believes that a fully functioning democracy requires robust coverage and scrutiny of science. Journalists, even the most scientifically literate ones, could all benefit from some self-reflection. And scientists, even the most media-savvy ones, could benefit from a better understanding of how and why things can go wrong. People in both camps who do things well should spread their ideas and knowledge to colleagues who only ever complain or misunderstand from a distance. To address these issues, I've helped to organise a meeting at the Royal Institution in London: \"Scientists and journalists need different things from science. Discuss\". A lot of words have been spoken on this subject, a lot of blogposts written and tonnes of phlegm and bile thrown around. The debate at the Royal Institution will be purposefully different, an attempt to get beyond the old mud-slinging and to create something genuinely useful for anyone interested in making science reporting better. As such, the structure of the debate will be tightly controlled to prevent unnecessary repetitions of hackneyed \"but this is why you're shit\" arguments. In the spirit of constructiveness, each speaker will start the discussion with a set of ideas of how their profession can make general reporting about science better. Chris Chambers of the University of Cardiff will present ideas about how scientists could do things better. Ananyo Bhattacharya, chief online editor at Nature, will outline how reporters might up their game. Both speakers will post their initial thoughts on this blog and, using the most useful comments from Guardian readers, will begin the debate on 13 March with a few self-critical ideas. Chairing the debate will be Alice Bell of Imperial College London, who will also write up her thoughts on the event afterwards. Freelance science journalist and blogger, Ed Yong, and the head of the UK's Science Media Centre, Fiona Fox, will formally respond to Chambers's and Bhattacharya's ideas. Then we'll ask members of the audience \u2013 which I hope will be a cross-section of everyone from readers to scientists to journalists to press officers \u2013 to raise ideas that could form the basis of some notional good practice guidelines for the better use of science in journalism. These ideas will be published on this blog after the event. I don't expect them to be definitive and they certainly will not be rules. Rather they should form the basis of further discussions for anyone interested in spreading good practice. I hope you'll take some time to consider coming to the event on 13 March or taking part in the discussions beforehand. But first, read our speakers' posts and have your say. Tickets are available here (use the code \"scimedia\" to get half-price tickets). If you can't come to the event itself, do get involved before and during in comments or on Twitter, using the hashtag #Riscimedia. Start leaving your comments here",

      "bodyText": "Ed Miliband has sought to shrug off personal criticisms after facing a barracking during a live radio phone-in over his leadership of the Labour party. Miliband appeared on Radio 5 Live to discuss a speech to the Engineering Employers Federation on Tuesday in which he championed British business and called for a more prominent standard Made in Britain label on all British products. But his pitch was overshadowed as callers took turns to attack Miliband's own brand, telling him that he lacked gravitas, failed to inspire disillusioned Labour voters and would never lead the party to election victory. One caller mistakenly called him David, the name of Miliband's older brother, whom he beat in the 2010 party leadership election. Miliband stood firm as he dismissed poll ratings and said he remained optimistic and confident that Labour could win the next general election under his leadership. Asked by the 5 Live presenter Victoria Derbyshire whether he was frustrated by the personal attacks, he said: \"I'm not affected because you come into this job knowing you'll get lots of commentary, lots of criticism and people saying 'do it this way and do it that way' \u2026 that's life. That's what you come into this gig for. Actually what matters to me is the people I meet and the issues I talk about.\" Asked about his hopes for the next general election, in 2015, he said: \"I'm optimistic and I'm confident, because I think we are talking about the right things, the things that matter to people. But you never take the British people for granted of course. What you say is let's pull forward what we believe as a party and what I believe as a leader. I came into politics because I believe in a more fair, more equal, more just society. We don't have that at the moment. We have got to change that.\" Miliband was put under pressure minutes after he went on air to outline the key points of his speech, which laid out support for British manufacturing through state cash and skills training, for instance in engineering. When he temporarily went off air because of a problem with reception in the radio car, \"Charles in Wakefield\" called in to tell Derbyshire that Miliband had \"no gravitas\" and was unelectable. When Miliband came back, the caller told him: \"I don't think people take you seriously \u2026 you are not going to be prime minister of this country by any stretch of the imagination. I'll bet my life on that. That is not going to happen. And if Labour are going to win an election it will be with somebody else, with Peter Hain or somebody like that, who's got a wealth of experience of life.\" He pointed out that Miliband's Made in Britain pitch sounded remarkably like Gordon Brown's call while he was in power for \"British jobs for British workers\". Miliband joked that he would pass on the compliment to Hain, adding: \"We'll have to agree to disagree. I'm going to keep doing my job as I see it, which is to talk about the issues that matter. This morning's speech is about a very important issue. It's important to our region \u2013 to the region in Yorkshire, where I'm an MP \u2013 because I think creating high-quality jobs for the future in manufacturing and engineering are really important.\" But his first interaction was a taste of things to come. A Labour voter called David told Miliband that he failed to inspire. \"You fail to get people looking forward to going out and getting the Labour vote out \u2026 you're not inspiring anyone. You're making it hard for people to vote Labour,\" the caller said. Miliband unsuccessfully sought to deflect the personal attack by teasing out the issue of most concern to the caller. The caller said his biggest issue was Miliband's leadership. \"I'm sorry about this and I don't mean to be cruel, but the job that you're doing is so important, that I don't think you can do the job.\" Miliband replied: \"We obviously have a difference of view about that, David. I go around the country and talk to lots and lots of people about how we can change their lives. That's what I came into politics for, that's what I think the Labour party is about. People make their own judgments about that.\" He said personal attacks did not frustrate him. \"What frustrates me is what is happening to the country, what is happening to the NHS, young people being out of work. That's what frustrates me. That's what I care about. That's why I'm in politics.\" Asked why Labour wasn't doing better in the polls, Miliband insisted \"it takes time\" for parties to recover from defeat. He said he was concentrating on \"doing the right thing\" by addressing the most important issues such as fixing the economy so \"it doesn't just work for a few people at the top\". Miliband told Derbyshire he very occasionally talked to his predecessors Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Blair's advice to him? \"To do it in your own way,\" Miliband replied.",

      "bodyText": "Last year former Greek prime minister George Papandreou tried his hand at boxing and went nose to nose with the Brussels eurocracy. After throwing a few punches, he found his own corner had thrown in the towel. Without the support of his team, he scuttled back to Athens and acceded to all demands for austerity. Newly elected Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy is ready to take Papandreou's place. Rajoy's demand for a period of forgiveness is now being seen as a call to arms. Will he find himself isolated like Papandreou when he enters the ring? Will the threats of retribution from Brussels scare his party and Spain's big businesses into demanding a U-turn? At the moment it would seem the muscle is with Rajoy. Figures on Tuesday showing a 0.3% slump in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the prospect of a recession are stark reminders of Spain's fragile economy. It adds to the view that he now runs the most threatening of eurozone countries (threatening to stability, that is). Italy's debts are under control after a clampdown on spending by Rome. But Spain's more devolved administrative structure makes it harder to manage. Regional governments from Catalonia to Andalucia are desperate to maintain their spending to remain popular. Picking a fight with Madrid could be electorally beneficial. On Tuesday they will set new limits on spending and while they are unlikely to get much more flexibility, Rajoy is unable to impose stricter spending rules. So his attack on Brussels is likely to get widespread internal support. Spain, like Portugal and Ireland, has done most of what is asked of it. Greeks know they are partly to blame for their own problems and subsequent failure to react with realistic reforms. Proposals by the EU to fine countries that fail to meet deficit reduction targets will go down like a bad oyster in Spain, where there is a sense that it has embraced free markets, at least to some extent. No wonder the markets are nervous. A fight between Brussels and Madrid will be uglier than the gouging of Greece. If the Netherlands objects to fines and joins in, the crisis will be back on.",

However, Zeiler admitted on Tuesday as RTL unveiled positive results for 2011 that a key tenet of the pan-European broadcaster's strategy is to look for opportunities to grow production, rights and distribution arm FremantleMedia, which co-produces The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent. Zeiler said RTL's strategy was to first look at what investment case there might be to support its broadcasting operations and then to look at FremantleMedia. \"We want to grow Fremantle, that is our goal,\" he said, speaking on a media conference call. \"We have stated that strategy for a long time and we will continue that.\" Zeiler dismissed a report in an Italian newspaper in November which claimed RTL tabled a non-binding offer for Endemol, which has been involved in a protracted restructure to reduce its \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.33bn) debt. \"We didn't put any non-binding or binding offer on the table,\" said Zeiler, who is about to leave RTL to run Time Warner international channels business Turner Broadcasting. \"For the future, no comment. We never speculate, we haven't for the last nine years [of his tenure as chief executive] and that policy won't change in the final two months.\" Responding to a more general question about the mergers and acquisition market Zeiler said despite the \"not so great macro economic climate\" many media assets were over priced. \"It is not easy to buy assets at a reasonable price,\" he said. \"We are not desperate enough to buy assets that are overvalued, we do not over pay.\" He pointed out that the company has more than \u20ac1.2bn in cash on its books, \"plenty if we want to invest\".

      "bodyText": "Hamas will not do Iran's bidding in any war with Israel, according to senior figures within the militant Islamic group. \"If there is a war between two powers, Hamas will not be part of such a war,\" Salah Bardawil, a member of the organisation's political bureau in Gaza City, told the Guardian. He denied the group would launch rockets into Israel at Tehran's request in response to a strike on its nuclear sites. \"Hamas is not part of military alliances in the region,\" said Bardawil. \"Our strategy is to defend our rights\" The stance underscores Hamas's rift with its key financial sponsor and its realignment with the Muslim Brotherhood and popular protest movements in the Arab world. Bardawil's words were echoed by a second senior Hamas figure, who declined to be named. Hamas, he said, \"would not get involved\" in any war between Iran and Israel. Speculation in Israel about the repercussions of a military strike on Iran has encompassed the likelihood of the Jewish state coming under sustained rocket fire from Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both organisations are routinely described by Israeli officials as \"proxies\" for the Iranian regime. However, Hamas has never given \"complete loyalty\" to Tehran, said Bardawil, pointing out that Iran's population is overwhelmingly Shia, whereas Gaza is Sunni. \"The relationship was based on common interests.\" Tehran has withdrawn its patronage of Hamas over the Palestinian group's refusal to support the Syrian regime against a year-long uprising. According to a Gazan academic who specialises in Islamic movements, this has included the termination of financial support worth $23m (\u00a314.5m) a month. \"Iran is very unhappy about Hamas and Syria, so it is punishing Hamas,\" said Adnan Abu Amer of Ummah university. \"They have stopped funding. Hamas has other sources \u2013 the Gulf states, Islamic movements, charities \u2013 but all of these together are not comparable to $23m a month.\" Bardawil denied this sum, saying \"the money that comes from Iran is very limited. In the early days of the [Israeli] blockade [of Gaza], the money was very good, but it was reduced two years ago.\" The cut in funding \"is not because of the Syrian revolution,\" he added. Abu Amer, who had links to both Hamas and the Syrian government during three years in Damascus studying for a PhD, likens the rupture between the two sides to a divorce. \"Syria has become the past for Hamas. It's not a complete divorce, but the love will not return. Both sides understand this.\" Khaled Meshaal, the exiled leader of Hamas, was the second most important person in the country after President Bashar al-Assad, said Abu Amer. \"The hotline between them was unique.\" Hamas leaders in Syria were treated like members of state, he said. \"The regime even allowed Hamas people to hold weapons. It was like a military base for Hamas.\" But the uprising against the regime put Hamas in a critical position. \"For 10 months, Hamas kept silent in public about the Syrian revolution, neither for it nor against it. But inside Hamas, there was another revolution \u2013 arguments within the leadership over the killing of Syrian people,\" said Abu Amer. \"The exiled leadership was frozen, because they had no other place to go. But others, in Gaza and elsewhere, wanted to speak out against the killings, especially the clerics. This was a burden on the leadership.\" In addition, the Muslim Brotherhood in the region was openly critical of the Syrian regime and urged Hamas to break with Assad. In particular, the influential Islamic cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi put personal pressure on Meshaal, said Abu Amer. Bardawil confirmed the dilemma for the exiled Hamas leadership. \"When the bloodshed increased, it was hard ethically not to express sadness. Hamas always stands with the people, not the regimes, but that does not mean holding a weapon to take part in military action against the regime.\" The Muslim Brotherhood exerted an influence, he said. \"Hamas has been part of the Muslim Brotherhood from the beginning. The leadership has a very tight relationship with the Brotherhood leadership.\" The connection between the two organisations was based on ideology, he said, whereas the relationship between Hamas and Syria was strategic. Hamas has been careful not to completely cut its ties with Syria despite the relocation of the leadership to other countries. \"There are still a few Hamas members in Damascus,\" said Abu Amer. \"And those who left have not made public statements against the regime. Both sides need back-up.\" According to Bardawil, the Hamas office in Damascus \"is still open and functioning, but is empty. We still haven't found another country to move our office to.\" The external leadership is now scattered across Jordan, Qatar and Egypt, with one politburo member, Imad al-Alami, returning to Gaza after a 20-year absence. Some observers say the fragmentation of the external leadership of Hamas has inevitably strengthened the hand of the internal Gaza-based leadership headed by the de facto Gaza prime minister Ismail Haniyeh and Mahmoud Zahar. Frictions between the two sets of leaders have grown in recent months, particularly over the issue of political reconciliation between Hamas and its rival, Fatah. Meshaal has pushed hard for a rapprochement; Haniyeh and Zahar are resistant. In an unexpected and forceful show of solidarity in a speech in Cairo last month, Haniyeh saluted \"the heroic people of Syria who are striving for freedom, democracy and reform\". The move explicitly underlined Hamas's rift with the regime. According to Abu Amer, the external leadership was uncomfortable with Haniyeh's public stance. But more statements could be expected in the future, he said. \"It will gradually become more public. But the clearer, stronger statements will come from Hamas in Gaza.\" Hamas, he said, wants to be part of the Arab Spring. \"The revolutions in the Arab world and the rise of Islamic movements affected Hamas. Hamas read it very well.\" The organisation was realigning itself with ascendant Islamist movements which are more oriented towards elections and reaching out to the West than armed resistance. \"Hamas cannot be asked to erase the history of 25 years in one day. But it's coming.\" Indicative of that was unofficial back-channel contacts between western officials and representatives of Hamas. Bardawil said that he and Zahar met a delegation of Europeans and Americans in Cairo last May, and there had been subsequent meetings with different Hamas representatives. He declined to give details but said: \"We are asking to have those channels and connections to western countries. We want to tell our story.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2012. The original said: \"When the bloodshed increased, it was hard ethically not to express sadness. Hamas always stands with the people, not the regimes, but does that not mean holding a weapon to take part in military action against the regime.\" This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "At last year's London marathon my mates dressed up as Prince William and Kate Middleton. They captured the zeitgeist (that's German for \"spirit of the times\", I knew roughly what it meant but I had to look it up). Within hours, they were featured on the front page of a national newspaper, websites and television news bulletins across the globe. I watched in awe and just a little envy. So this year I planned to capture the London marathon zeitgeist myself, with the aid of a simple headdress. I was going to put on a headband with a vertical garden cane attached to it, supporting a 42cm-wide green vertical hoop \u2013 a bit like an angel's fallen halo or Princess Beatrice's royal wedding hat, but without the ribbony bits at the side and the toilet seat bit in the middle and it's a circle not an oval and it's green not pink and it's on my head, not hers. Other than that, it's practically identical. Yes, this hoop, worn with my Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research hi-vis yellow/snotty-green vest, would be my passport to worldwide fame and recognition. But what if there were more than one of us dressed like this? Specifically five of us dressed like this, the others with a black ring, a blue, a yellow and a red, running at first in a line and then merging ourselves into formation? Five Olympic rings at the Cutty Sark, five Olympic rings at Tower Bridge, five Olympic rings racing down the Mall with Buckingham Palace resplendent as a backdrop \u2026 Sport, London and the Olympic symbol would be brought together in one iconic image. Journalists the world over would form a media scrum to use it and find out who was behind it. My phone will be red hot with fevered interest: RING Hello, Time magazine? The cover, why of course! RING RING Le Monde? Le supplement? Naturellement! RING RING RING Piers, how are you? You're dropping Obama, you want me instead! RING RING RING RING Mr Jackson \u2026 if you insist, Peter \u2026 a sequel? Lord Of The Olympic Rings, oh, who'll be playing me? Pacino? De Niro's not free? OK! RING RING RING RING RING The London Olympic committee? Don't tell me you'd like me for the opening ceremony, just after Paul McCartney! The closing ceremony? You want me to run in the Olympic marathon? What's that? \u2026 You're going to sue me for infringement of copyright? I can't use the Olympic symbol or any form of guerrilla marketing? If I go ahead with it you'll sue the charity as well? Ah yes, the Olympic logo copyright. There is a whole library of downloadable leaflets you can view to make sure you don't infringe copyrights if you're planning an event or a campaign. There are all sorts of combinations of words you can't use: Olympics, Olympiad, London, 2012, Games, medals, breadknife (OK, I made the last one up). You can't use the symbol of the Olympic rings, the paralympic logo, the Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville (they're keeping an special eye on those). You can't use athletic images, representations of an Olympic-style torch and flame, even the colours of the Olympic rings. Noel Edmonds will need some new shirts. Bakers are even banned from icing cakes with the Olympic logo. The plan by Britain's leading cake decorators, British Sugarcraft Guild \u2013 to celebrate the 2012 games in icing and marzipan \u2013 has been left in tatters after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned it from copying any of its official symbols. The IOC said: \"We very much regret that this situation has arisen\" \u2026 Cakes, arisen, they've got a sense of humour at the IOC \u2026 but it's a serious business. Is it any coincidence that eight years after hosting the Athens Olympics, Greece's economy is on its knees? There's a punchline about the rest of Europe, but I'm not going to say it. The operating budget for the London Games is \u00a32bn, and a big chunk of that has to come from sponsors. Those sponsors demand exclusivity in return for their support so that the Games can make a profit and invest in sport in the UK beyond 2012. If you'd forked out a fortune to associate yourself with the Games and then some idiot came along and got a load of publicity for free, you be pretty cheesed off. So, I won't be running the London marathon with a coloured hoop on my head this year in support of the IOC \u2013 mainly because I don't want to get sued. But I really hope that at London 2012, the balance between the sponsors and the sport is as it should be, and that the big brands allow athletes to speak freely rather than toe a boring corporate line. I am hoping for great interviews \u2013 like the one with Rebecca Adlington after winning gold in Beijing saying \"I just want a hamburger and fries.\" Or Usain Bolt talking about his preparation for breaking the world 100m record: \"I never had breakfast. I woke up around 11, I watched television and then I had some [chicken] nuggets for lunch. I went back to my room, I slept for two hours, I went back for some more nuggets and came to the track.\" All this talk of food is making me hungry. I'd love a doughnut \u2026 one with green icing and then another four with blue, black, red and yellow. \u2022 This is an edited version of Tony Audenshaw's sketch for the weekly podcast Marathon Talk",

So this year I planned to capture the London marathon zeitgeist myself, with the aid of a simple headdress.</p> <p>I was going to put on a headband with a vertical garden cane attached to it, supporting a 42cm-wide green vertical hoop \u2013 a bit like an angel's fallen halo or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/04/princess-beatrice-royal-wedding-hat\" title=\"\">Princess Beatrice's royal wedding hat</a>, but without the ribbony bits at the side and the toilet seat bit in the middle and it's a circle not an oval and it's green not pink and it's on my head, not hers. Other than that, it's practically identical.</p> <p>Yes, this hoop, worn with my <a href=\"http://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research</a> hi-vis yellow/snotty-green vest, would be my passport to worldwide fame and recognition. But what if there were more than one of us dressed like this? Specifically five of us dressed like this, the others with a black ring, a blue, a yellow and a red, running at first in a line and then merging ourselves into formation? Five <a href=\"http://www.janecky.com/olympics/rings.html\" title=\"\">Olympic rings</a> at the Cutty Sark, five Olympic rings at Tower Bridge, five Olympic rings racing down the Mall with Buckingham Palace resplendent as a backdrop \u2026 Sport, London and the Olympic symbol would be brought together in one iconic image. Journalists the world over would form a media scrum to use it and find out who was behind it. My phone will be red hot with fevered interest:</p> <p><strong>RING</strong> Hello, Time magazine? The cover, why of course!</p> <p><strong>RING RING</strong> Le Monde? Le <em>supplement</em>? <em>Naturellement</em>!</p> <p><strong>RING RING RING</strong> Piers, how are you? You're dropping Obama, you want me instead!</p> <p><strong>RING RING RING RING</strong> Mr Jackson \u2026 if you insist, <em>Peter</em> \u2026 a sequel? Lord Of The Olympic Rings, oh, who'll be playing me? Pacino? De Niro's not free? OK!</p> <p><strong>RING RING RING RING RING</strong> The London Olympic committee? Don't tell me you'd like me for the opening ceremony, just after Paul McCartney! The closing ceremony? You want me to run in the Olympic marathon? What's that? \u2026 You're going to sue me for infringement of copyright? I can't use the Olympic symbol or any form of guerrilla marketing? If I go ahead with it you'll sue the charity as well?</p> <p>Ah yes, the Olympic logo copyright. There is a whole library of downloadable leaflets you can view to make sure you don't infringe copyrights if you're planning an event or a campaign. There are all sorts of combinations of words you can't use: Olympics, Olympiad, London, 2012, Games, medals, breadknife (OK, I made the last one up). You can't use the symbol of the Olympic rings, the paralympic logo, the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/mascots\" title=\"\">Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville </a> (they're keeping an special eye on those). You can't use athletic images, representations of an Olympic-style torch and flame, even the colours of the Olympic rings. <a href=\"http://www.noeledmonds.tv/\" title=\"\">Noel Edmonds</a> will need some new shirts.</p> <p>Bakers <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2037418/London-2012-Olympics-Copyright-laws-ban-bakers-icing-cakes-logo.html\" title=\"\">are even banned from icing cakes</a> with the Olympic logo. The plan by Britain's leading cake decorators, British Sugarcraft Guild \u2013 to celebrate the 2012 games in icing and marzipan \u2013 has been left in tatters after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned it from copying any of its official symbols. The IOC said: \"We very much regret that this situation has arisen\" \u2026 Cakes, arisen, they've got a sense of humour at the IOC \u2026 but it's a serious business. Is it any coincidence that eight years after hosting the Athens Olympics, Greece's economy is on its knees? There's a punchline about the rest of Europe, but I'm not going to say it.</p> <p>The operating budget for the London Games is \u00a32bn, and a big chunk of that has to come from sponsors. Those sponsors demand exclusivity in return for their support so that the Games can make a profit and invest in sport in the UK beyond 2012. If you'd forked out a fortune to associate yourself with the Games and then some idiot came along and got a load of publicity for free, you be pretty cheesed off.</p> <p>So, I won't be running the London marathon with a coloured hoop on my head this year in support of the IOC \u2013 mainly because I don't want to get sued. But I really hope that at London 2012, the balance between the sponsors and the sport is as it should be, and that the big brands allow athletes to speak freely rather than toe a boring corporate line. I am hoping for great interviews \u2013 like the one with <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/7570547.stm\" title=\"\">Rebecca Adlington</a> after winning gold in Beijing saying \"I just want a hamburger and fries.\" Or Usain Bolt <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/7570547.stm\" title=\"\">talking about</a> his preparation for breaking the world 100m record: \"I never had breakfast. I woke up around 11, I watched television and then I had some [chicken] nuggets for lunch. I went back to my room, I slept for two hours, I went back for some more nuggets and came to the track.\"</p> <p>All this talk of food is making me hungry. I'd love a doughnut \u2026 one with green icing and then another four with blue, black, red and yellow.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited version of Tony Audenshaw's sketch for the weekly podcast <a href=\"http://www.marathontalk.com/\" title=\"\">Marathon Talk</a></p>",

The 56-year-old Gray made the admission in an interview with London's Evening Standard in which he also said he has found the decision to sack him and the stain it has cast on his reputation hard to accept. Asked if he has considered taking his own life since his dismissal, he said: \"Yes. I would be lying if I said I didn't.

It escalated from there for some reason, I've no idea why.\" Gray was later sacked by Sky's head of sport, Barney Francis, after footage emerged of him making sexist remarks about the assistant referee Sian Massey to Sky's pitchside reporter Andy Burton and also of an incident caught on camera a month earlier in which he made a suggestive comment to his colleague Charlotte Jackson. Gray is still adamant that the incident does not cast him in a true light. \"This was a private bit of banter released to the social media and for some reason the press etc tore us apart,\" he said. \"I have no problems with a woman referee.

Richard [Keys, who resigned after he was seen laughing with Gray in the footage] phoned her, apologised on our behalf and she said, 'Don't be so stupid, guys.'\" As for what happened with his colleague Jackson, Gray said: \"Again, it's probably an old man trying to be funny. It was no more than that. Charlotte knows us very well. For 17 years, my life was a dressing room and everyone who's been in a dressing room knows what kind of banter goes on. \"It's a place where you can get ripped apart at times by your fellow players.

The flanker failed to recover from a knee injury sustained in the opening half of the victory over England for Saturday's clash with Italy in Cardiff and the prop Gethin Jenkins will lead the side. The centre Jamie Roberts, who missed the second half at Twickenham after suffering a recurrence of a knee ligament injury, has proved his fitness after missing out on the triple crown celebrations in London. He was driven home after the match with ice on his knee and sat on his sofa while his team-mates enjoyed themselves. The hooker Matthew Rees, whose last start for Wales was in the 2010 Six Nations, has recovered from a calf strain to team up with his Lions props Jenkins and Adam Jones for only the fourth time since the 2009 tour to South Africa. Another player returning is Luke Charteris. The second row, who made his first appearance since the World Cup for Newport Gwent Dragons last week, is named on the bench for a match Wales need to win to maintain their push for a third grand slam in eight seasons. \"Sam has a bit of a medial strain but we hope he will be fit to face France next week,\" said the Wales coach Warren Gatland. \"We were concerned about Jamie initially, but he has taken a full part in training and he is fully fit.\" Wales's final two matches are at the Millennium Stadium and when they last won the grand slam, back in 2008, their final match was France in Cardiff. \"We need to refocus sharply after our triple crown triumph at Twickenham if we are to give ourselves the best chance of being in contention for the championship on the final weekend,\" said Gatland. \"Italy will be hoping to find us complacent, with one eye on the French game, but nothing less than victory on Saturday will be accepted by this Wales team or satisfy the nation behind us. That all leaves the players themselves brimming with ruthless intent.\" Justin Tipuric, who replaced Warburton at the start of the second-half against Ireland in Dublin in the opening round, starts in the Six Nations for the first time having missed out against Scotland because of injury. James Hook is back on the bench after recovering from chickenpox and he is joined there by Ken Owens, whose place in the starting line-up has been taken by Rees, Wales's captain last year. Jenkins becomes the third player to lead Wales this year \u2013 he has yet to taste victory as the national captain with three previous defeats \u2013 but the disruptions have not affected the performances of a side that reached the World Cup semi-finals last October, losing by a point to France in Auckland having played for the final 61 minutes with 14 men after Warburton was sent off. \"We have strong leaders and characters in the team,\" said Gatland. \"We feel Gethin is the right call to make as captain: he has done it before and it takes a bit of the pressure off Matthew who can concentrate on playing.\" Wales have won nine of their last 13 internationals, winning away to Ireland and England in the same campaign for only the second time since 1988. \"When we win, we grow an arm and a leg in terms of confidence and self-belief,\" said Gatland. \"There is a real spring in the players. \"The thing about the Six Nations is that if you lose one or two games, the roof almost caves in on you because of the criticism you come under: you are looking sideways, sidestepping bullets and pulling a few knives out of your back. If you win a few and gain momentum, it becomes an enjoyable tournament. \"That's professional sport. We are in a good place at the moment and I cannot emphasise enough how professional the players are in terms of the way they prepare and the extras they do afterwards.

      "bodyText": "Tottenham Hotspur's defeat to Manchester United on Sunday was, in some ways, freakish. United were second best for much of the first hour, but found themselves 2-0 up thanks to two defensive errors. First, Kyle Walker failed to pick up Wayne Rooney from a corner and then Luka Modric switched off to allow Nani to collect a throw-in unchallenged, allowing him the space to put in the cross that led to Ashley Young's first goal. Young's second was also partly down to poor defending as everybody backed off allowing him the space to shape in his shot. That happens sometimes and in isolation an unfortunate 3-1 defeat to United would not raise too many concerns. What is more troubling is the general pattern that is emerging of what happens when Tottenham lose and it raises serious questions about Harry Redknapp's suitability for the England job. Spurs have lost six league games this season. One of them, at Stoke City, was largely the result of some poor refereeing. In the other five, Spurs have conceded three on three occasions and five twice. In all of them, there were moments when Spurs played well, when it looked like the game might fall their way, but in all of them they ultimately paid for their openness. In both the 5-1 home defeat to Manchester City and the 5-2 defeat at Arsenal, there was a spell of 20 to 25 minutes when they seemed powerless to stop the tide. Both involved Spurs setting out in a 4-4-2 against a side that outnumbered them in central midfield (Arsenal in a classic 4-3-3, City playing a narrow 4-4-1-1/4-2-3-1 that, with Sergio Ag\u00fcero dropping deep and Samir Nasri and James Milner playing narrow, gave them an effective extra man in the middle). The gamble then is always that the team playing 4-4-2 will be unable to gain meaningful possession either because they are being bullied physically in the middle or because the team with the extra central man can keep the ball away from them. The pay-off is that with two forwards the side playing 4-4-2 can be more direct and, when they do get possession, are able to exploit space in wide areas (as Spurs did, for instance, away to Milan and more especially at home to Internazionale in the Champions League last season). In that Tottenham rapidly went 2-0 up at the Emirates, the gamble could be said to have paid off. But really both goals stemmed from defensive laxity, as Arsenal were caught with both full-backs high up the pitch with Alex Song in no position to cover. Even then it took a deflection and a questionable refereeing decision to bring the goals. Arsenal might have wilted and the game would have been written off as Spurs capitalising on their shortcomings at the back, but they did not. So palpable was Arsenal's superiority even at 2-0 down that the comeback always seemed possible. Once the first goal had gone in, it even seemed likely. Redknapp recognised that, of course, and switched to a 4-3-3-cum-4-1-4-1 at half-time, bringing on Sandro and Rafael van der Vaart for Louis Saha and Niko Kranjcar. He was unable, though, to staunch the bleeding. Partly that was down to momentum, but equally there was a loss of shape. Gareth Bale did almost nothing to check Bacary Sagna's forward surges \u2013 one of which led directly to Arsenal's third goal. Sandro seemed confused as to what his role was supposed to be; if he was meant to be sitting, he did not. Spurs pushed higher than they had in the first half \u2013 logically, for a single striker can become very isolated if his back four sits too deep, but with the offside line rickety and the pressing lacking focus all that did was create room for Theo Walcott to attack with his pace. Redknapp is far from the tactical Luddite he often likes to make out . He tends to deal in broad brush-strokes, preferring to get the basic strategy right and avoid the risk of overcomplicating things. There is nothing wrong with that and his success over the past couple of years at Spurs is evidence of how effective the approach can be. There is no such thing as the perfect manager who is supremely gifted in all aspects of the game. But, at the very highest level, there will be times when a manager sees an opponent hitting form and is forced simply to shut the game down, to minimise the damage, see through the storm and then assess if anything can be salvaged. Roberto Mancini did it last season when his Manchester City side ran into an Arsenal in peak form. After enduring a 10-minute drubbing, he retreated to the bunker and dug in for a goalless draw, a decision that drew criticism but also won a point they almost certainly would not have won otherwise. Or take the way Antonio Conte shuffled his Juventus side from 3-5-2 to 4-3-3 as Milan outplayed them in the first half a fortnight ago . Even 1-0 down there was a spell of simply breaking up the game and keeping Milan in reach. Having done so, he could then look to strike back and did so, finding an equaliser through the substitute Alessandro Matri. Conte admitted he got it wrong initially, but the point is he was able to correct the error. Contrast that, say to Tottenham's performance away to Real Madrid in the Champions League last season when having gone a goal and a man down with the sending-off of Peter Crouch, they were not only unable to check Madrid's forward momentum, but seemed to have little notion of how they might begin to do so, being run ragged by Madrid's overlapping full-backs. Killing the game is not pretty. It is not something that wins reams of positive media coverage. But it is necessary, particularly at international level where football has become increasingly attritional because of the lack of time available to coaches to develop attacking cohesion. If he takes the England job, Redknapp will probably inspire a short-term jolt of optimism and his uncomplicated attacking approach may bring impressive results against lesser opposition. The problem, though, will come when England have to break up the game against opponents of similar or greater stature. Tottenham are the third-best team in the country and have let in 14 goals in four games against the two sides better than them and six in two against the fourth-best. In tournament football, that equates to comfortable qualification followed by an exit against the first serious contender England meet, which is pretty much where they have been since 1968. If only there was somebody around who could organise a side to frustrate, say, the reigning world and European champions and then nick a goal from a set-play to pull off an improbable 1-0 win.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/mar/04/tottenham-manchester-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">Tottenham Hotspur's defeat to Manchester United on Sunday</a> was, in some ways, freakish. United were second best for much of the first hour, but found themselves 2-0 up thanks to two defensive errors. First, Kyle Walker failed to pick up Wayne Rooney from a corner and then Luka Modric switched off to allow Nani to collect a throw-in unchallenged, allowing him the space to put in the cross that led to Ashley Young's first goal. Young's second was also partly down to poor defending as everybody backed off allowing him the space to shape in his shot.</p> <p>That happens sometimes and in isolation an unfortunate 3-1 defeat to United would not raise too many concerns. What is more troubling is the general pattern that is emerging of what happens when Tottenham lose and it raises serious questions about Harry Redknapp's suitability for the England job.</p> <p>Spurs have lost six league games this season. One of them, at Stoke City, was largely the result of some poor refereeing. In the other five, Spurs have conceded three on three occasions and five twice. In all of them, there were moments when Spurs played well, when it looked like the game might fall their way, but in all of them they ultimately paid for their openness. In both the 5-1 home defeat to Manchester City and the 5-2 defeat at Arsenal, there was a spell of 20 to 25 minutes when they seemed powerless to stop the tide.</p> <p>Both involved Spurs setting out in a 4-4-2 against a side that outnumbered them in central midfield (Arsenal in a classic 4-3-3, City playing a narrow 4-4-1-1/4-2-3-1 that, with Sergio Ag\u00fcero dropping deep and Samir Nasri and James Milner playing narrow, gave them an effective extra man in the middle). The gamble then is always that the team playing 4-4-2 will be unable to gain meaningful possession either because they are being bullied physically in the middle or because the team with the extra central man can keep the ball away from them. The pay-off is that with two forwards the side playing 4-4-2 can be more direct and, when they do get possession, are able to exploit space in wide areas (as Spurs did, for instance, away to Milan and more especially at home to Internazionale in the Champions League last season).</p> <p>In that Tottenham rapidly went 2-0 up at the Emirates, the gamble could be said to have paid off. But really both goals stemmed from defensive laxity, as Arsenal were caught with both full-backs high up the pitch with Alex Song in no position to cover. Even then it took a deflection and a questionable refereeing decision to bring the goals. Arsenal might have wilted and the game would have been written off as Spurs capitalising on their shortcomings at the back, but they did not. So palpable was Arsenal's superiority even at 2-0 down that the comeback always seemed possible. Once the first goal had gone in, it even seemed likely.</p> <p>Redknapp recognised that, of course, and switched to a 4-3-3-cum-4-1-4-1 at half-time, bringing on Sandro and Rafael van der Vaart for Louis Saha and Niko Kranjcar. He was unable, though, to staunch the bleeding. Partly that was down to momentum, but equally there was a loss of shape.

      "bodyText": "Since Slumdog Millionaire, Freida Pinto has played a Palestinian orphan, an American primatologist, an ancient Greek priestess and an Arab princess. Either by adventurousness or design, it looks like she's striving to be a new kind of film star: one not bound in her roles by ethnicity, and able to appeal freely across those boundaries, too. A few years ago, people were talking about Vin Diesel in similar tones. He was a throwback to 80s juiceheads like Arnie, but, with his mixed-race background, he also looked like an action star for multicultural times. That dream ended with the failure of his signature antihero Riddick's \"chronicles\". But then his Fast &amp; Furious franchise, into its fifth instalment last year, weirdly impervious in its urban-petrolhead elysium, all peoples equally inaudible beneath the roar of a fat exhaust pipe, hints that the idea of a pan-ethnic star might still have a future. Hang on, though \u2013 isn't appealing across ethnic lines what Hollywood has done since its Golden Age heyday? Hasn't its stable of stars, from Gish to Pitt, managed to seduce their way around the globe several times over? Well, yes \u2013 but they always had the air of colonists for Anglo-American culture. The more globalised and intermingled the world has become, the more anachronistic the A-list's predominantly Caucasian lineup looks. Hollywood \u2013 slow to produce black stars, and now Latino ones \u2013 has struggled to reflect the diversity inside America; that problem is multiplied a thousandfold now that its key market is the global one. No wonder the star system, saddled with supplying the new faces, has seized up. You can see the attraction of a quick fix: universal stars who can transcend borders and assume multiple cultural identities. But Pinto, closing Steve Rose's recent interview, touched on the contradictions: \"I like being the outsider in a way, everywhere I go. I know I'm from India and I fit in there completely, but I like looking at things from the outside. I don't want to be fitted in somewhere. I fit into the world.\" Unfortunately, an outsider in the worst sense is what she has seemed like in too many of her roles, especially Miral and Black Gold. She might give a kohl-rimmed glimpse of a new, frictionless, globalised kind of stardom, but ethnicity, and the history that underlies it, still count. They give any drama its power dynamics and sense of place, and false notes always ring out. Would an Arab actor, in a historical film, have performed Pinto's daft soft-porn striptease in Black Gold? Of course, modern blockbusters ask for these things. Perhaps making the public swallow them is part of Pinto's job description if the pan-ethnic star project is going to get off the ground. She's not quite there yet. And the work is getting harder: you certainly can't turn up and \"do foreign\" any more, like Sean Connery, who in Highlander delivered the only Spanish nobleman on record with a Scots accent. Even more convincing practitioners like Omar Sharif, who played Arab, Russian, Mexican, Argentine and virtually everything else, might struggle under the weight of scrutiny these days. Character actors get more leeway \u2013 like the Englishman Mark Strong, who plays a sheikh (very well) in Black Gold, and has played Arab before \u2013 but it's trickier for stars in the limelight. The danger is that in trying to appeal to everyone, Pinto captivates no one, or just becomes some cheap signifier of the exotic. The danger is that, as a star property, her appeal will be shallow. That's arguably what happened to Diesel, albeit in a much pulpier sphere of entertainment. He was talked up as having the broadest possible audience, but has wound up with a narrow career, now apparently reduced to the Fast &amp; Furious franchise and rumours of resurrecting Pitch Black. His filmography certainly hasn't been stellar, but I think he also stepped \u2013 especially with the abortive xXx franchise, touted as a kind of multicultural 007 \u2013 into the kind of overly focus-grouped, demographic no-man's land that is the most artificial aspect of multiculturalism, and that infringes upon the rules of close audience identification on which stardom ultimately rests. James Bond's original constituency was end-of-empire fantasists, and men, and more besides. Who did Xander Cage appeal to? The Celtic-tattooed, extreme sports-loving badass outsider of indeterminate ghetto origin? Who the hell is even called \"Xander Cage\"? Pinto has, to be fair, picked more grounded roles. And in Michael Winterbottom's Trishna, she returns to her own ethnicity \u2013 and turns in a performance of purpose and resonance at last. It's tempting to conclude that stars are most effective playing on home territory, but there's a danger in that, too. I do think that they still draw their power first as a crude kind of representative \u2013 why else would the cry be ongoing for more black A-listers to sit alongside Will Smith and Denzel Washington? But that's just the start: stars of the highest luminosity always register beyond their community. The Fresh Prince is still worth $20m a film for a reason. And that's possible because ethnic categories break down in the crucible of story. The sharpest of divisions can be dissolved this way: Toby Miller's book Global Hollywood 2 cites screen studies of native Americans happy to identify with western pioneers in cowboy films. The French don't let his Norman-hating tendencies get in the way of cheering Robin des Bois. Everyone, no matter what their mother tongue, is part-American now. These leaps of sympathy is what globalisation, on a good day, is about \u2013 and that will give possibilities for a new definition of stardom. But it is possible, as Pinto is doing, to stretch things too far. All things to all men might be a bit much, but there's no reason why the pan-ethnic celebrity can't be more things. The game is called acting, after all \u2013 but the golden rule is that it has to look natural. Jackie Chan struggled when he tried to go Hollywood, but the whole world understood him in his Hong Kong days when he was yelling in Cantonese and jumping on to bicycle seatposts. It goes for stardom, too, old- or new-school: you get the best reaction when you're being yourself. \u2022 Trishna is out on Friday. \u2022 What global box-office stories should we be writing about?

It's about making the operations of HM Revenue &amp; Customs more efficient, but it will also be crucial in the implementation of universal credit, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) programme at the heart of the government's welfare reform policy. RTI will involve employers and pension providers telling HMRC about tax, national insurance contributions and other deductions at the time, or before, payments are made, instead of waiting until the end of the tax year. The move is intended to help DWP provide claimants with universal credit without demanding information on their incomes, and with more confidence that it is getting the payments right. It is a big, highly complex project, but according Mark Holden, the RTI programme director at HMRC, it is on schedule for full delivery by October of 2013. A handful of employers are due to take part in a pilot beginning in April of this year, with the numbers rising to 300, then more than 1,000, then hundreds of thousands by April 2013. \"All the IT is tracking, we're in final phases of testing, and it's looking very good,\" Holden says. While he anticipates some big challenges, he believes they're unlikely to be around the technology. \"Probably it's more around the implementation. Although this is very big IT, it's not bleeding edge technology. The biggest change is around any changes the employers have to make, so the real thing for us is making sure the communications are clear, making sure the guidance we are publishing is in plain English and the employers understand it first time around. \"That's why we're really pleased to be able to run a pilot, which is not a luxury we've had many times before.\" There will be \"a lot of hand holding\", according to Holden, who would rather identify and correct glitches at this stage than after the go live. Employers and software makers prepare There are two major constituencies to deal with in implementing the programme \u2013 the employers who will provide the information and the developers of PAYE software. Holden says that awareness among the former group is mainly limited to larger organisations at the moment, but that HMRC is now focused on spreading it to SMEs and micro-employers, with a communications strategy planned to ensure they are all ready to take part next year. The 400 or so PAYE system providers are all onboard already. \"We have an ongoing relationship with them, so we have a very established mechanism for working with them and their trade bodies,\" Holden says. \"For the 18 months we've been preparing to bring this in we've been working through the specs, working on any glitches that they see, and making sure we're designing the system with their input. \"This is very much a collaborative project rather than us just putting out the spec and saying 'Good luck guys', and I'm very pleased that we've had massive engagement throughout, and have their representatives on our programme board.\" How much work is need to make PAYE software compatible with RTI? According to Holden, it is hard to give a definitive answer given the vast number of products concerned, but it is not cutting edge technology, and amounts to an evolution than a revolution of suppliers' systems, he says. \"It is incremental for them, but I don't want to underplay the amount of work involved,\" he says. Internally, most of the programme is built on platforms already used by HMRC. In most cases, such as the department's SAP platform, it requires an enhancement rather than a radical change, and the biggest challenge is in the massive number of interfaces that have to be tested \u2013 and have to work before going live. The Aspire consortium, the largest IT supplier to HMRC, has been undertaking most of the relevant technology work under the direction of the in-house project team. While the consortium is bringing all the pieces together, some SMEs are also involved in the project, including one which is developing a PAYE tool that will allow employers without commercial software to file information. Working with the DWP The DWP also has a role to play in the programme. The two departments have a history of sharing information, with more than 60,000 DWP users transacting with HMRC systems about 200,000 times a day, and about 5,000 HMRC staff transacting with DWP systems, and both source large amounts of data from the other, in areas such as income tax, national insurance, child benefit and tax credits. Holden says the programme is building on what they have already done together, and that both have representatives in their programme teams for RTI and universal credits. \"Although we're really clear in governance terms that [RTI is] an HMRC programme, if you looked across the piece you would be hard pressed to split the two programmes apart,\" he says. \"The feedback we're getting from DWP and all the external reviews is that it's an exemplar in terms of working with them.\" While senior officials at HMRC are confident that they will deliver RTI on schedule, they are being cautious over one big feature: one element of the programme involves moving away from reporting through the Electronic Data Interchange and Government Gateway to using Bacs, the banks' channel for transferring payments. The software and banking industries have expressed concerns over the timetable for the change, and HMRC has stood back from setting a target date. \"One of the reasons we want to make sure everyone is ready for that is that in moving to Bacs as a filing channel we need to work very closely with the banking industry and it is technically their channel, and any changes we make have to be tested with all of the banks on board,\" Holden says. \"At the moment we've got two tried and tested channels, Electronic Data Interchange and the Government Gateway, both of which are high volume, and all of the software industry is used to working with them. That's what we'll go live with. \"If and when we decide to move to a different channel we'll give the industry plenty of notice to enable them to make those changes to their products.\" Underlying all this he makes a point that is often heard, but sometimes lost, in the progress of such big programmes. RTI involves a lot of work on technology, but it essentially a business programme. The first test of its success will come after October 2013, when all can see whether HMRC's business with employers has changed in the way it is intended. The second will come when universal credit fully kicks in, and we see whether the government has pulled it off on that reputational issue. This article is published by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "It was one of the BBC's biggest cost-cutting initiatives to save \u00a3700m a year. So it might appear strange, to some observers at least, that a senior corporation executive spent \u00a3220 on drinks as a \"thank you\" to eight people for their work on \"Delivering Quality First\". BBC Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan's drinks bill was revealed in the latest round of executive expenses claims published by the BBC on Tuesday for the three months to the end of September 2011. The total expenses claimed by the BBC's senior executives was down 15% on the previous quarter but up year on year. They relate to the BBC's 101 senior managers, those earning more than \u00a3150,000 a year or sit on one of its divisional boards. Shennan, who also oversees 6 Music and is a former controller of Radio 5 Live, was in charge of the journalism \"workstream\" to look into how BBC News could save money. The expenses claim for \u00a3220 on 3 June last year was for a \"DQF thank you drinks for journalism\" and had \"eight attendees\", according to the expenses information published on Tuesday. Senior BBC executives have become increasingly careful about what they claim since the corporation started publicly publishing expenses in 2009. But there were still some interesting expenses incurred, including Shennan's fellow controller, Radio 3 boss Roger Wright, who spent \u00a3850 on lunch in September last year for \"34 key staff\" who worked on a \"record-breaking Proms season\". Wright racked up six three-figure cab trips home from late-night Proms last year totalling \u00a31,007. A BBC spokesman said Wright took the cabs home to avoid incurring the expenses of a central London hotel stay. The BBC's quarterly salary and expenses disclosure also includes details of hospitality and gifts. During the three months to the end of September 2011 BBC director general Mark Thompson went to the Wimbledon women's tennis final, invited by the chairman of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Club, and the British Formula One Grand Prix, invited by \"Formula One management\". He was also invited by Warner Bros to the film premiere of the final Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, and went to Glyndebourne, courtesy of its general director, David Pickard. Elsewhere, the BBC's chief financial officer Zarin Patel spent more than \u00a3500 on a retirement dinner attended by 12 people on 9 June last year. A BBC spokesperson said: \"There will always be unavoidable costs to keep the business running but we are mindful that we spend public money and we work hard to keep this expenditure to a minimum.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "A UN environmental team has arrived in Australia for a crunch 10-day assessment of the Great Barrier Reef, warning that the coral ecosystem is at a \"crossroads\" due to the soaring activity of the mining industry in the World Heritage Area. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) visit comes amid fears that the reef's world heritage listing, which it has held since 1981, could be placed in jeopardy after rapid escalation in coal exports and gas exploration. \"The Great Barrier Reef is definitely at a crossroad and decisions that will be taken over the next one, two, three years might potentially be crucial for the long-term conservation [of the reef],\" said Fanny Douvere, from Unesco's World Heritage marine programme. Australia's coal boom is set to open up the previously undeveloped Galilee Basin in central Queensland, greatly increasing the number of developments along the state's coast, where the 1,800-mile reef stretches. The proposed infrastructure includes Abbott Point, which would become the largest coal export port in the world. At full capacity, the expansion would see more than 10,000 coal-laden ships a year cross the Great Barrier Reef by the end of the decade \u2013 a sizeable increase on the 1,722 vessels that entered the World Heritage Area in 2011. Environmentalists are concerned that ships navigating reef passageways \u2013 many of which are narrower than the English Channel \u2013 will run aground, as a Chinese vessel did in 2010, tearing a two-mile gash into the coral and spilling several tonnes of oil. There are also warnings that the reef's six species of turtle, including the endangered loggerhead and Olive Ridley turtles, and the snubfin dolphin, Australia's only endemic dolphin, would be affected by any mass industrialisation of the Queensland coast. Any reduction in visitor numbers to a region that generates AUS$6bn a year from tourists would also be keenly felt by local businesses and the Australian economy at large. Douvere and Tim Badman from the International Union for Conservation of Nature are set to meet with government ministers and NGOs, as well as visit the reef to assess the impact of new developments. The specially arranged trip follows a minor diplomatic incident last year when Unesco's World Heritage Committee said it was \"extremely concerned\" that the Australian government had not informed it of the approval of a major liquefied natural gas hub on Curtis Island, off the Queensland coast. The expansion of the hub at Gladstone has been blamed for a sharp drop in water quality and widespread disease of marine creatures. More than 45m cubic metres of sea floor is to be dredged in the World Heritage Area to accommodate the boom in shipping, with the government warning that it will penalise mining companies that dump accumulated waste on the corals. Douvere said: \"When it comes to dredging issues I think that a big part of our discussions need to focus on what the alternatives are.\" Speaking to the Guardian from Paris, prior to her departure to Australia, Douvere said that there were multiple threats to the reef's wellbeing. \"We won't just be looking at the increase in shipping, but also issues such as how climate change and the recent cyclone and extreme weather has affected the reef,\" she said. \"We will look at the overall impact of these things. We don't regularly make these kind of trips but it was asked for by the World Heritage Committee after issues were raised last year.\" Environmental groups have claimed that Unesco's visit is an embarrassment for the Australian government. Greenpeace Australia spokesman James Lorenz said: \"We are looking at an enormous, unprecedented increase in coal, oil and gas exploitation here.\" \"Unesco is clearly very worried about this and if they decide the reef is in danger, that places it at the same level as sites in places such as Afghanistan, which is deeply embarrassing for Australia.\" \"The Great Barrier Reef is priceless but it is being treated like it's a worthless. It has been mismanaged for years and we are now at a tipping point.\" Both the federal Australian and state Queensland governments have launched their own 18-month assessments of the reef, although ministers have come under fire for considering several large developments, including Abbott Point, during the review. Tony Burke, Australia's environment minister, has defended his handling of the issue, telling ABC Radio: \"Let's not forget, with Abbot Point, there is already a significant level of industry that occurs there.\" \"One of the largest levels of concern here is shipping, as the vessels move through the reef area. So those shipping movement issues are issues that really have to be front of mind throughout all of this.\" The UN report will handed to the World Heritage Committee, which will decide on any response at a meeting in St Petersburg in July.",

We don't regularly make these kind of trips but it was asked for by the World Heritage Committee after issues were raised last year.\"</p> <p>Environmental groups have claimed that Unesco's visit is an embarrassment for the Australian government.</p> <p>Greenpeace Australia spokesman James Lorenz said: \"We are looking at an enormous, unprecedented increase in coal, oil and gas exploitation here.\"</p> <p>\"Unesco is clearly very worried about this and if they decide the reef is in danger, that places it at the same level as sites in places such as Afghanistan, which is deeply embarrassing for Australia.\"</p> <p>\"The Great Barrier Reef is priceless but it is being treated like it's a worthless. It has been mismanaged for years and we are now at a tipping point.\"</p> <p>Both the federal Australian and state Queensland governments have launched their own 18-month assessments of the reef, although ministers have come under fire for considering several large developments, including Abbott Point, during the review.</p> <p>Tony Burke, Australia's environment minister, has defended his handling of the issue, telling ABC Radio: \"Let's not forget, with Abbot Point, there is already a significant level of industry that occurs there.\"</p> <p>\"One of the largest levels of concern here is shipping, as the vessels move through the reef area. So those shipping movement issues are issues that really have to be front of mind throughout all of this.\"</p> <p>The UN report will handed to the World Heritage Committee, which will decide on any response at <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/events/809\">a meeting in St Petersburg in July</a>.<br></p>",

Ben Goldacre puts it a little differently in Bad Science, suggesting that there is almost no theory \u2013 however crackpot \u2013 for which you can't find at least one supporting research paper. The broader point is this; when it comes to assessing the current state of scientific knowledge, individual experts and bits of research mean approximately jack shit. Science is an epic competition of ideas; players hurl arguments and counter-arguments back-and-forth for years as consensus slowly emerges. Assessing the state of the game from any one fragment of the action is like trying to plot a weather system from the erratic motions of a single snowflake, tumbling in the wind. Yet legions of science reporters are trying to do just that. Science stories are plagued with opaque references to 'experts' and 'scientists', who 'say' or 'claim' things. The most common of these crimes against meaning is perhaps the ubiquitous phrase 'scientists say', a lazy clause as informative as \"some people say...\" or \"I heard down the pub that...\" On many occasions when the phrase is employed, 'scientists say' no such thing. Some scientists say it, some don't, and some might say something completely different. Often the writer makes little attempt to clarify where the claim stands in the grand order of things. Stories like this achieve a number of things: they imply consensus where none exists, they fail to place research in context, they fetishize individual studies and people, and they provide audiences with an erratic and chaotic picture of scientific progress. By failing to put new research in proper context, newspapers train their readers to view science as a homogeneous community of 'them', and wonder why 'they' make apparently contradictory claims at different times. Science is portrayed as much less stable and certain than it actually is, which plays neatly into the hands of the \"merchants of doubt\" described by Oreskes and Conway. The diet industry is built on the promotion of ignorance, and is a natural beneficiary of this bollocks, as Harvard's nutrition advice website bemoans: ...when it comes to research on nutrition and health, media reports are often responsible for much of the frustration the public feels toward the public health community. With their emphasis on short, \"newsworthy\" pieces, the media often only report the results of single studies, and many stories are chosen simply because the results run contrary to current health recommendations. Because such reports provide little information about how the new results fit in with other evidence on the topic, the public is left to assume that, once again, the scientists are contradicting each other, leaving the public totally confused. The same happened in Britain with the MMR scare; public confidence in the vaccine suffered because newspapers failed to report Andrew Wakefield's research in context. One small study simply shouldn't have mattered against the broader weight of scientific evidence, fraud or otherwise; but many in the press were either too ignorant to grasp this, or more interested in juicy sensationalism than clear context. Brian Deer's subsequent investigations were great journalism, but largely irrelevant to any scientific question about MMR; yet he seems to see himself as the hero of the story, once declaring in a bad-tempered Guardian piece that, \"13 years passed before I slayed the MMR monster.\" The monster was long since dead of course, its twitching corpse dutifully held aloft by a legion of crappy hacks for St. Brian to stick his sword into. The irony of Deer's pursuit of the MMR dragon is that it reinforced the mistaken belief that Wakefield and his study ever mattered in the first place. A debate that should have been about the weight of scientific evidence became instead a personality contest. Deer's investigation of Wakefield was informed by the same flawed world-view that led to the scare in the first place; the belief that personalities, bold statements and single studies matter more than evidence, context and consensus. Stories based on single studies or experts are not unlikely to be wrong, and over-reliance on stock phrases like 'scientists say' suggests the writer hasn't grasped the wider picture.

      "bodyText": "It is now widely accepted that the last Labour government did not give enough priority to building new affordable homes. It made the planning system more proactive and it had a good record in some areas of housing investment, especially in tackling the enormous inherited backlog of repairs and improvements to the social housing stock. And its classical Keynesian response to the recession put large extra amounts of investment into new homes from 2008 onwards. Unfortunately, that investment \u2013 homes started under Labour but completed under the Tories \u2013 has obscured the disastrous collapse of the genuinely affordable housing programme since May 2010. Looking forward, unless we think big, the lack of supply and the resultant high value of housing will be problems that blight the country for a generation. And it is increasingly clear that the broad policy framework, no matter how well conceived, will not deliver the needed homes unless the financial model is right. And that means not only making sure that each scheme is viable but also delivering sufficient investment in total with the right amount of subsidy to make a sufficient proportion of the homes affordable. There are two big ideas around that could make the kind of difference \u2013 billions of pounds \u2013 that is needed. First, to bring about a grand shift in the balance of investment by pension funds. All pensioners have done badly out of a model that depended too much on the appreciation of stocks and shares; when they stopped appreciating, pensioners lost out. There is potentially a synergetic relationship between pension funds, which need good returns over the long term, and housing investment, which produces relatively weak short-term but excellent long-term returns. Most development for rented homes makes a loss in the first few years and a rising profit after that \u2013 because borrowing costs are reasonably constant over the lifetime of the home but rental income keeps rising year after year. If, and there have been some exemplars, many more deals could be struck whereby the investing pension fund received a lower return at the start, which then rose over time, thereby matching the income stream, affordable housing could be produced with a much lower need for initial subsidy. The second idea which is bubbling under is quantitative easing through housing investment. The Bank of England has printed hundreds of billions of pounds through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. Essentially this means that money is created electronically and used to buy back gilts from banks, pension funds and insurance companies, strengthening their balance sheets and boosting their capacity to create new investments. The hope is that these institutions, with artificially boosted balance sheets, will in turn put more real resources into the economy by lending to businesses. The problem is that this is a chain with weak links and it is based more on the hope than a requirement that it will boost lending. A more purposeful alternative would be to use QE \u2013 technically the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund (APF) \u2013 to create funds which come directly into housing by buying housing bonds. The purchase of corporate bonds, as opposed to the purchase of gilts, has been a very small part of QE so far. Some amendment might be needed to the APF's rules, but in theory at least APF could buy local authority housing bonds (although there is a problem with falling foul of the public borrowing rules, see below) or bonds issued by housing associations or their intermediaries (which would count as private sector activity). Such bonds are highly rated by the credit rating agencies. Even if the Bank of England is not willing to use APF to buy housing bonds, these two ideas could be brought together in a more circuitous route: the Bank buys gilts from pension funds, the pension funds use their extra capacity to buy housing bonds, preferably on a more sustainable long-term financing model. The issue about local authority bonds and public borrowing has been raised on Red Brick blog before. Although over the years people campaigning against the Treasury rules have seen some helpful shifts in policy, such as the creation of the prudential borrowing regime for example, the Treasury has remained obsessed by total public sector borrowing including government-owned trading corporations (which in turn includes housing). In many other countries borrowing by government-owned corporations is not included in the main measure of public borrowing because they are deemed, like private corporations, to be able to finance their own borrowing from their own business plans. Instead other countries measure 'general government' borrowing. The fact that these definitions are Treasury-made and not inviolable is shown by the fact that the nationalised banks are already treated differently from other government-owned bodies. As Professor Steve Wilcox argues in the new UK Housing Review (his chapter includes an excellent round-up of the arguments against this Treasury orthodoxy): \"Adopting those international fiscal measures would enable public corporations to play a far more active role in promoting economic growth\u2026 there are\u2026 obvious examples in terms of housing policy where switching to international fiscal measures would open the door to a far more active role for local government.\" Indeed the strength of this argument is reinforced by the growing evidence that housing investment pays for itself through increased tax income and reduced benefit expenditure \u2013 borrowing should be regarded differently if the Treasury gets its money back. These are complex issues that have huge implications for housing, where policy is more dependent than in any other area, with the possible exception of transport, on borrowing for long term investment \u2013 investment that, because of rising rents, is highly profitable in the long term. My knowledge is probably extended to the limit by writing this blogpost, but there are others who understand this world of high finance and could develop detailed proposals. But it needs political will to do so: political will that unfortunately was absent during the Labour government years. But the opportunity of going into the next election with a genuine offer of many more homes, and a worked-out plan to deliver them, is a prize which is at least worthy of detailed examination.

      "bodyText": "The Home Office has announced it will pilot a new domestic violence disclosure scheme known as \"Clare's Law\". The campaign for this scheme was spearheaded by Michael Brown, the brave father of Clare Wood, who was brutally murdered by a man known to the police for a string of violent offences against other women. I admire Michael's courage in fighting for change, but I do not think that this disclosure scheme is the answer. In my eyes, it is another way for the government to sound tough on domestic violence while actually doing very little. The disclosure scheme will give people the \"right to ask\" about a partner's previous convictions. I am not opposed to the underlying concept \u2013 that sharing information about violent perpetrators may help prevent further crime. But current legislation already allows this to happen. As it stands, the public has the right to ask about an individual's previous convictions, and the police have the power to disclose that information where it could protect potential victims. Indeed, this is what should have happened in the tragic case of Clare Wood. The police knew about her killer's violent past and they should have disclosed this information to her. But, more importantly, they should have responded to Clare's urgent pleas for protection. Clare reported George Appleton to the police on numerous occasions, including for a serious sexual assault. She described his threats to kill her. The police arrested and bailed him \u2013 at one point arresting him after he had breached his bail, only to immediately de-arrest him. This is the real crux of the matter. What good will costly, bureaucratic new schemes do when the police so consistently fail to perform the most basic duties towards victims of domestic violence? Refuge has worked on a number of high-profile cases where basic police failings have been shown to have contributed to the death of a woman. Numerous IPCC reports into domestic violence homicides have highlighted poor practice in critical areas such as investigating allegations, responding to 999 calls, collecting evidence, and performing risk assessments. The police don't need new schemes. They simply need to understand and implement the law as it stands. In this time of austerity, precious funding should be spent on improving the quality of specialist training for officers. Gaining a deeper grasp of the complex dynamics of domestic violence would help officers respond more appropriately to victims and better understand when a woman \u2013 like Clare Wood \u2013 is at severe risk of harm. There are other problems with the new disclosure scheme. For one thing, it rests on the flawed assumption that women will \"just leave\" if they discover that their partner has a history of violence. At Refuge, we know that this is a vast simplification; there are many practical and psychological barriers to leaving a violent partner. Research also shows that women and their children are at the highest risk of homicide at the point of separating, or just after separating, from an abuser. If a woman chooses not to leave her partner, will she be blamed if he goes on to attack her? Will she be at risk of losing her children to the care system? Will the police believe her calls for help? We already find that negative attitudes towards victims persist in many police forces and we are concerned that this new scheme could unwittingly reinforce this ugly appetite for victim-blaming. How many women will actually use the scheme? Which of us, realistically, would visit a police station to enquire about a new partner's criminal past during the first flush of a romance? Some supporters have said that if it saves one life, it will be worth it. This is missing the point. Domestic violence takes a huge death toll in this country. The police receive a domestic violence-related call every 60 seconds. Every single week in England and Wales, two women are killed by a current or former partner. Untold numbers of children are also witnesses and victims of abuse. This is a crime on a gigantic scale. The response to it should be concerned with helping the majority of victims. We know that the most effective way to do this is to improve the police response to victims, and to invest in a broad range of specialist services that save and change lives.

The company behind the Johnson Cleaners chain and the predominantly London-based upmarket Jeeves of Belgravia stores said its dry-cleaning revenues were down 1.8% at \u00a377.3m last year, with operating profits flat at \u00a32m. Highlighting a tough economic backdrop, Johnson Service Group cited falls in business in the aftermath of \"negative newsflow\" during 2011. \"High-street trading remained tough in 2011, as economic conditions put severe pressure on disposable incomes, which consequently impacted upon the number of visitors to the high street and ultimately on the quality of businesses continuing to operate,\" the company said in its full-year results. As the makeup of high streets changes and fewer people shop there, the company is looking to more convenient, car-friendly locations for its dry cleaners such as petrol stations and big supermarkets. Meanwhile workers squeezed by a combination of near-stagnant wages and high inflation appear to be cutting back on dry-cleaning spending, for example by waiting longer before getting suits laundered. Against that backdrop, Johnson said it had slowed down its store refurbishment programme and closed some stores altogether \"as we continue to actively withdraw from poorer locations and focus our attention on more convenient sites\". In contrast, Johnson's luxury London business echoes other evidence of a growing north-south economic divide. Its Jeeves of Belgravia business enjoyed a \"year of high activity\", opening new stores in St Paul's last year and Notting Hill this year. It is also tapping into another bracket of society seemingly untouched by the economic downturn, with a new branch in the Premier League footballer-dominated area of Alderley Edge, Cheshire. Shares in Johnson Service, which also hires out work uniforms and linen to the hospitality industry, ticked higher in early trading after the overall group reported a rise in profits and raised its dividend. Adjusted profit before tax rose 3.4% to \u00a315m while the final 2011 dividend was increased a fifth to 0.67p, making 1p for the full year. The chairman, John Talbot, said: \"I am pleased with these results given the very difficult market conditions.\" But he added that market conditions were not expected to improve in 2012.",

      "bodyText": "Safety scandals are not deterring patients from seeking treatment at failing hospitals, a new study says. Researchers from Imperial College London studied patient numbers at three hospitals that underwent highly critical and widely publicised failures reported by the Healthcare Commission, a predecessor of the Care Quality Commission. Despite widespread media coverage of serious lapses in performance, they found that this had no overall effect on patient numbers at two of the hospitals, and only a temporary decline at the third. The findings add to a growing body of research that question the role of patient choice to improve healthcare services, a central component of the health and social care bill. Researchers looked at University hospitals of Leicester trust and Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells, both investigated for the poor management of Clostridium difficile in 2007, and Mid-Staffordshire foundation trust, investigated for a high number of death rates in emergency admissions in 2009. The serious failings had no overall effect on patient numbers in Leicester and Mid-Staffordshire. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells had 12% fewer patients at three months and 14% fewer patients at six months following the publication of the investigation, compared with patient numbers at nearby hospitals, but figures returned to normal soon after the report came out. In the study, published in the Health Affairs journal, the authors conclude: \"Our finding that these highly publicised quality failings did not have a large or sustained impact on levels of health service use reinforces the view that simplistic assumptions regarding the power of information to drive patient choices are unrealistic.\" Anthony Laverty, lead author of the study and researcher at Imperial College London, said he was surprised with the results following widespread media coverage each hospital received. The study follows the health secretary's speech at the Nuffield Trust health policy summit last week, where he reiterated his commitment to the NHS reforms, which call for more competition to improve healthcare. But Laverty said that providing information to patients in the hope that it will drive up standards is \"dangerous\". \"If patients are not going to avoid a hospital that is involved in a massive scandal, that has been splashed across the news as having killed people, then it seems unlikely that patients will avoid a hospital on the basis of information on the NHS Choices website,\" said Laverty. Improvements in performance are most likely to come from within the healthcare provider due to concerns of reputational damage and not from patients who do not necessarily seek care at the best hospitals, Laverty explained. Nick Black, professor of health services at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agreed. \"The really powerful effect of publishing information is how managers and clinicians respond, not the public,\" he said, adding that \"standards in quality have to be the responsibility of managers and clinicians. I'm not against patient choice but I don't think we should expect too much from it in terms of driving up quality.\" Black's research on focus groups of patients seeking elective surgery has found that patient decisions on selecting a healthcare provider tend to be based on the location of the hospital from their home and recommendations from relatives or friends, not on information about quality. Gwyn Bevan, professor of management science at the London School of Economics, who carried out a review of patient choice and competition, said he is \"perplexed\" by Andrew Lansley's emphasis on the role of choice and competition because \"the evidence is very weak and contested\". \"In fact, I would argue that we don't have any strong evidence of that effect. To my mind, the jury is at best still out on whether choice and competition will improve quality of care in the NHS,\" he said. This article is published by Guardian Professional.

      "body": "<p>Safety scandals are not deterring patients from seeking treatment at failing hospitals, a new study says.</p> <p>Researchers from Imperial College London studied patient numbers at three hospitals that underwent highly critical and widely publicised failures reported by the Healthcare Commission, a predecessor of the <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Care Quality Commission</a>.</p> <p>Despite widespread media coverage of serious lapses in performance, they found that this had no overall effect on patient numbers at two of the hospitals, and only a temporary decline at the third.</p> <p>The findings add to a growing body of research that question the role of patient choice to improve healthcare services, a central component of the health and social care bill.</p> <p>Researchers looked at University hospitals of Leicester trust and Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells, both investigated for the poor management of Clostridium difficile in 2007, and Mid-Staffordshire foundation trust, investigated for a high number of death rates in emergency admissions in 2009.</p> <p>The serious failings had no overall effect on patient numbers in Leicester and Mid-Staffordshire.</p> <p>Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells had 12% fewer patients at three months and 14% fewer patients at six months following the publication of the investigation, compared with patient numbers at nearby hospitals, but figures returned to normal soon after the report came out.</p> <p>In the study, published in the <a href=\"http://www.healthaffairs.org/\" title=\"\">Health Affairs</a> journal, the authors conclude: \"Our finding that these highly publicised quality failings did not have a large or sustained impact on levels of health service use reinforces the view that simplistic assumptions regarding the power of information to drive patient choices are unrealistic.\"</p> <p>Anthony Laverty, lead author of the study and researcher at Imperial College London, said he was surprised with the results following widespread media coverage each hospital received.</p> <p>The study follows the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/feb/28/live-blog-lansley-nuffield-summit\" title=\"\">health secretary's speech at the Nuffield Trust health policy summit</a> last week, where he reiterated his commitment to the NHS reforms, which call for more competition to improve healthcare.</p> <p>But Laverty said that providing information to patients in the hope that it will drive up standards is \"dangerous\".</p> <p>\"If patients are not going to avoid a hospital that is involved in a massive scandal, that has been splashed across the news as having killed people, then it seems unlikely that patients will avoid a hospital on the basis of information on the NHS Choices website,\" said Laverty.</p> <p>Improvements in performance are most likely to come from within the healthcare provider due to concerns of reputational damage and not from patients who do not necessarily seek care at the best hospitals, Laverty explained. Nick Black, professor of health services at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agreed.</p> <p>\"The really powerful effect of publishing information is how managers and clinicians respond, not the public,\" he said, adding that \"standards in quality have to be the responsibility of managers and clinicians. I'm not against patient choice but I don't think we should expect too much from it in terms of driving up quality.\"</p> <p>Black's research on focus groups of patients seeking elective surgery has found that patient decisions on selecting a healthcare provider tend to be based on the location of the hospital from their home and recommendations from relatives or friends, not on information about quality.</p> <p>Gwyn Bevan, professor of management science at the London School of Economics, who carried out a <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d6470\" title=\"\">review of patient choice and competition</a>, said he is \"perplexed\" by Andrew Lansley's emphasis on the role of choice and competition because \"the evidence is very weak and contested\".</p> <p>\"In fact, I would argue that we don't have any strong evidence of that effect. To my mind, the jury is at best still out on whether choice and competition will improve quality of care in the NHS,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

Grossman first entered the public consciousness when Tom Cruise pulled on a bald wig, dark glasses, padding and a large amount of bling to play him in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder. Cruise revived the character for a duet with Jennifer Lopez at the 2010 MTV movie awards and revealed at the time that a big screen outing was in the works.

So we want to try and get a little bit of a glimpse of where that rage is coming from. The guy will be a force of nature, but we want to have some kind of emotional connection to him.\" Bacall, who also wrote Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim Vs the World and the upcoming 21 Jump Street film, said he was excited about Grossman's potential as a lead character, despite the movie producer having only appeared briefly in Tropic Thunder. \"I felt really great about that from the beginning because I loved the character,\" he said. \"Tom had an incredible idea on how to tell this story, and give it some real emotion and heart. And as soon as he hit on that idea, it was off to the races. But I feel really good about that project, and I hope that it will happen.\" Cruise himself is on a career upturn after Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol became the highest-grossing film in the four-movie spy series earlier this year.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago, when we began setting up the Legal Ombudsman, our first press release talked of the new service as helping to resolve disputes between lawyers and their customers. The Guardian's Marcel Berlins immediately took me to task for my solecism: people who use the services of lawyers are clients, he said, and to refer to them as customers was an unforgivable error. But the choice of words had been a deliberate symbol of the change which our arrival signalled. The term \"client\" embodies the traditional view of the relationship between lawyers and those they represent: one of unequal power and status. For every client there is a patron, someone of higher rank who offers help and protection in return for future favours: Julius Caesar, a successful lawyer long before he was a successful general, built his political career on his network of grateful clients whom he had helped in the notoriously combative courts of the late Roman republic. But the notion of customer turns this relationship on its head. In most businesses, customer is king. It is the customer who has the power, who can pick and choose what services to buy and from what provider. In a normal free market, it would be the lawyers who compete for patronage, rather than bestow it. But those are not the traditions of the law and, protected by their social status, political power and deliberately obfuscatory language, lawyers have hitherto been able to ignore the notion of customer service. But the bulwarks of legal tradition are crumbling as the market changes, and lawyers are being forced to face the possibility that their habitual view of how they go about their daily work may have to go a fundamental change. Those who adapt to the market, it appears, will survive; those who cannot may be doomed to disappear. Nowhere is the battle between the traditional view of client and customer more marked than in the notion of pricing. It is this collision between what lawyers are used to providing and what the modern users of professional services are increasingly accustomed to expect which is at the root of the 100,000 contacts from disgruntled customers we receive every year and no fewer than one quarter of these, by far the largest element of our workload, are about cost. Take an obvious example of the sort of thing we see. People going to see a solicitor may be told that it is not possible to put a price on what the service may cost but the lawyer will charge, say, \u00a3201 per hour plus VAT, with fees and disbursements (there's that legal language again) being extra. Even for someone familiar with the law, that provides almost no useful information about how much they can expect to pay and little or what options they have to keep costs down. An hourly pricing rate with no cap allows the lawyer to determine what work they deem necessary to carry out and makes it almost impossible for the customer to challenge the eventual size of the bill. Nor does it provide any useful information which allows a customer to compare the cost of one lawyer with another. When challenged about this sort of practice, lawyers will argue that the trajectory of many legal transactions is impossible to predict \u2013 cases can be quick and relatively low-cost or they can be prolonged and extremely complex, requiring contested court hearings with all the associated expense. Indeed, while lawyers are increasingly bowing to consumer expectations by offering estimates of how much the service might cost, they do not regard those as in any way binding: we have seen estimates of \u00a35,000 translate into final bills of ten times that amount. And where both sides in a piece of litigation are working on an hourly-rate model, the temptation to string the matter out by engaging in unnecessarily combative or complex correspondence sometimes appears to be overwhelming. Of course there is some truth in their argument (lawyers rarely advance arguments entirely without some element of truth). Litigation can be very unpredictable and costs can vary hugely. But that is only true of a relatively small proportion of legal services. Writing a will, buying or selling a home, even conducting a simple criminal case \u2013 all of these activities are in most cases entirely predictable transactions where costs can be calculated well in advance. Even where more complex transactions are involved, it is often possible to predict what each element of the service may cost and offer some sort of conditional pricing dependent upon how the case unfolds. And that is exactly where the leaders of the legal services market are going. We are already seeing the arrival of new, nakedly commercial enterprises offering fixed price wills or conveyancing, breaking those transactions down into discrete elements many of which can be provided by relatively unqualified (low-cost) staff supported by specialist legal software. The involvement of large insurers in funding personal injury or employment claims has led to a far more acute understanding of the likely cost of simpler litigation. Law firms who seem incapable of working on a fixed costs model for individual clients appear far more willing to do so for insurers and the Legal Services Commission. And as the legal services marked continues to change, with the arrival of commercial giants such as the Co-op and the increasing cross-selling of financial, legal and other services by banks and insurers, it is the lawyers who show that they can adapt their traditional view of clients and put customers at the heart of their business who stand the best chance of prospering. There are risks in that new market: no one wants pile 'em high and flog 'em cheap law, particularly not when our children, our homes or our freedom are at stake. But if it means cheaper, more predictable pricing, one of the key barriers between citizens and legal services will be removed.",

      "bodyText": "Extending secret hearings into civil courts will undermine effective scrutiny of government operations in the \"war on terror\", according to prominent civil liberties activists and lawyers. In a letter to the Guardian, the director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, the Conservative MP David Davis, Lady Kennedy QC, the former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald QC and others warn that the government's justice and security green paper violates \"basic principles of the common law\". Their criticism comes as the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, gives evidence to parliament's joint human rights committee on the impact of the proposals that will prevent claimants being told of the evidence against them. \"The worst excesses of the war on terror were revealed by open courts and a free media. Yet the justice and security green paper seeks to place government above the law and would undermine such crucial scrutiny,\" the letter \u2013 also signed by the Rev Nicholas Mercer, human rights lawyer of the year, and Dinah Rose QC, who has worked a special advocate in security sensitive cases \u2013 declares. \"It would permit the extension of closed material procedures, in which claimants and their lawyers are excluded from court and refused sight of government evidence, to any civil claim, whenever a minister considers that openness is against the 'public interest'. \"This violates two of the most basic principles of our common law system: the right of every party to know the case against them, so that they can answer it; and the principle that there must be equality of arms between parties in court. It would permit secret hearings, and the giving of secret judgments by courts, accessible only to the government.\" The proposals have been introduced in response to claims brought by those who have been mistreated or detained at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. \"Surely,\" the letter concludes, \"the response to the exposure of British complicity in kidnap and torture ought to be to ensure that such events will never be repeated; not to create a system that is designed to ensure that they could never be exposed?\" The justice secretary has attempted to allay fears by insisting that closed material procedures (CMPs) will only apply to a \"tiny\" number of civil cases in \"very limited circumstances\". Writing in the Daily Mail before his appearance before the select committee on Tuesday afternoon, Clarke explained: \"I have heard, loud and clear, the fears from many campaigners including special advocates, that the government's proposals are too broadly drawn and might even mean that the likes of the Stephen Lawrence trial and De Menezes case could end up in secret. \"That's not what anyone wants. The reforms we are proposing will apply only in very limited circumstances, in a tiny number of civil cases, where the public safety could otherwise be put at risk. \"Under these plans, there will be no change to anyone's right to make their allegations public. Courts would continue to hear the vast majority of cases in the open. Closed hearings would be limited to evidence that would genuinely endanger the most sensitive informant that we rely on to protect the public.\" Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, has argued that co-operation with foreign intelligence agencies such as the CIA would be endangered if secrets were exposed in court. \"It is essential that our courts are able to handle intelligence material, and that that material is properly protected,\" he has warned. \"It is a fundamental principle of intelligence-sharing that such exchanges are kept confidential.\" As well as the government, many Labour politicians have supported the main thrust of the reforms. The former home secretary David Blunkett has described the plans as \"appropriate\". The Liberal Democrats appear more divided. Sir Menzies Campbell supported the proposals in parliament on the grounds that they would help protect the UK's special intelligence relationship with the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Other MPs have expressed misgivings. In one of the latest consultation submissions published by the Cabinet Office, Cambridgeshire police point out that the green paper \"will have far-reaching consequences for the use of covert tactics within law enforcement agencies\". The supreme court is due to deliver judgment on the workings of CMPs in special immigration tribunals on Wednesday, a decision that may well influence the debate.",

Yet the justice and security green paper seeks to place government above the law and would undermine such crucial scrutiny,\" the letter \u2013 also signed by the Rev Nicholas Mercer, human rights lawyer of the year, and Dinah Rose QC, who has worked a special advocate in security sensitive cases \u2013 declares.</p> <p>\"It would permit the extension of closed material procedures, in which claimants and their lawyers are excluded from court and refused sight of government evidence, to any civil claim, whenever a minister considers that openness is against the 'public interest'.</p> <p>\"This violates two of the most basic principles of our common law system: the right of every party to know the case against them, so that they can answer it; and the principle that there must be equality of arms between parties in court. It would permit secret hearings, and the giving of secret judgments by courts, accessible only to the government.\"</p> <p>The proposals have been introduced in response to claims brought by those who have been mistreated or detained at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. \"Surely,\" the letter concludes, \"the response to the exposure of British complicity in kidnap and torture ought to be to ensure that such events will never be repeated; not to create a system that is designed to ensure that they could never be exposed?\"</p> <p>The justice secretary has attempted to allay fears by insisting that closed material procedures (CMPs) will only apply to a \"tiny\" number of civil cases in \"very limited circumstances\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2110721/KENNETH-CLARKE-We-hear-fears-open-justice-loud-clear.html\" title=\"\">Writing in the Daily Mail</a> before his appearance before the select committee on Tuesday afternoon, Clarke explained: \"I have heard, loud and clear, the fears from many campaigners including special advocates, that the government's proposals are too broadly drawn and might even mean that the likes of the Stephen Lawrence trial and De Menezes case could end up in secret.</p> <p>\"That's not what anyone wants. The reforms we are proposing will apply only in very limited circumstances, in a tiny number of civil cases, where the public safety could otherwise be put at risk.</p> <p>\"Under these plans, there will be no change to anyone's right to make their allegations public. Courts would continue to hear the vast majority of cases in the open. Closed hearings would be limited to evidence that would genuinely endanger the most sensitive informant that we rely on to protect the public.\"</p> <p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, has argued that co-operation with foreign intelligence agencies such as the CIA would be endangered if secrets were exposed in court.</p> <p>\"It is essential that our courts are able to handle intelligence material, and that that material is properly protected,\" he has warned. \"It is a fundamental principle of intelligence-sharing that such exchanges are kept confidential.\"</p> <p>As well as the government, many Labour politicians have supported the main thrust of the reforms. The former home secretary David Blunkett has described the plans as \"appropriate\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats appear more divided. Sir Menzies Campbell supported the proposals in parliament on the grounds that they would help protect the UK's special intelligence relationship with the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Other MPs have expressed misgivings.</p> <p>In one of the latest consultation <a href=\"http://consultation.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/justiceandsecurity/responses-to-the-consultation\" title=\"\">submissions published by the Cabinet Office</a>, Cambridgeshire police point out that the green paper \"will have far-reaching consequences for the use of covert tactics within law enforcement agencies\".</p> <p>The supreme court is due to deliver judgment on the workings of CMPs in special immigration tribunals on Wednesday, a decision that may well influence the debate.</p>",

The conference brought together over a hundred world leaders and took place under intense media scrutiny as a host of future markers were set. \"People were excited, we had more NGOs there in Rio than had ever assembled before. We had more heads of government, presidents, prime ministers and a couple of Kings,\" says Maurice Strong, secretary general at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, in the above video. Addressing the need to tackle the complex environmental and social issues that now, 20 years on, are more pressing than ever. Rio Mark 1 produced a host of promises in the form of Agenda 21 and three conventions, on climate biodiversity and deserts. \"I think it's important to think about how much the Rio conference itself, 20 years ago, in fact achieved\" says Gro Harlem Brundtland, chair of the Brundtland Commission. \"It is exceptional in international relations that a summit like that decides both on a climate convention and a biodiversity convention and an Agenda 21.\" \"The important thing is that we got an agreement beyond what anybody thought was possible,\" Strong says before making a point that rings throughout the video. \"The problem has been what happened afterwards which is not enough.\" The theme that is apparent throughout the video is that efforts made since 1992 are nowhere near enough as the original Rio architects reflect on the outcomes of the last 20 years. How far has sustainable development really come? \"We've made some progress on awareness - 20 years ago no one was talking about the need to make development more sustainable, now just about everybody is,\" says Jim MacNeill, secretary general of the Brundtland Commission. \"But as far as action is concerned, the sad fact is that the unsustainable trends that prompted the United Nations to call for the establishment of a special commission in 1983 have grown steadily worse and they've now reached dangerous levels.\" Yolanda Kakabadse, president at WWF International says: \"I don't think we have made the necessary progress. In 20 years, I would have loved to see much more being done, more results, more concrete products of what we proposed in Rio 20 years ago. \"We wanted to have much more response from governments at a national level, at a local level and also at the international level and we haven't had enough of that. \"I think we have moved ahead with more vision maybe and commitment on the part of the civil society groups and the business sectors but definitely not enough.\" Whilst the original summit achieved a lot what is clear from the video is that delivery has not been sufficient. Describing innovation in technology and advances in policy-making in both business and government as \"remarkable\", Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, makes the observation that whilst small advances are encouraging, no real changes will be enacted without responses being scaled-up. We'd like to know what you think \u2022 What are your views on how far sustainable development has come since 1992? \u2022 What progress has been made and where have we failed? \u2022 What does Rio+20 need to achieve to ensure a renewed commitment to sustainable development? \u2022 How will the two climate summits differ and what challenges have emerged since 1992?

As I entered the grand Harvard University hall I had to fight my scepticism \u2013 how could the world's most powerful, edgy, female performance pop icon really affect the lives of damaged, marginalised and bullied youth with integrity and authenticity? But there was no hard sell, no fancy staging, lighting or pyrotechnics on the bare wooden stage. This was an unplugged event like no other, as first Oprah Winfrey, then Lady Gaga's mother, Cynthia Germanotta, and lastly \u2013 to rapturous applause \u2013 the 25-year-old Lady Gaga herself appeared. They had gathered to launch the foundation and talk about love, kindness, and bravery. Earlier that day I had joined 90 experts from around the world at a symposium on youth meanness and cruelty brought together by the BTWF and Harvard's Berkman centre for internet and society. We were joined by 10 extraordinarily brave young people who were developing the kind of projects that the foundation seeks to promote. They were the real stars of the event. Sharing stories of starting school chapters to combat bullying, asking teachers for meetings at which they could share how it felt to be bullied for being gay, how \u2013 with no one else to help them \u2013 they had to turn to each other for support as they endured the \"casual cruelty\" and meanness online and in the playground. Working as I do with excluded young people in London, I had asked my young experts back home what questions I should put to Lady Gaga. The simplest question was one I put to her mother: \"What was Lady Gaga's school life like?\" She explained that as a child Lady Gaga had tried to be normal and was a very good student, getting involved in sport and going to summer camp. However, her enormous drive to create and perform her music became a conflict for her, especially when she wanted to write music while her friends were out playing and found that they didn't understand her. When the isolation and bullying started her teachers didn't see it. Her difference was what set her apart. Is it any wonder then that a central thrust of the foundation's work will be helping to create safe spaces for young people to explore their identity and difference, and then being given the skills and opportunities to become modern-day warriors for a braver, kinder world? Whether you are born this way, I'm not sure. Many of the children I work with aren't, it is often a cruel society and they have to struggle with feelings of abandonment by adults. So does this role model and foundation have anything to offer our young people? Yes, of course, there is a lot we can share, especially about who are the real superstars. \u2022 Stephen Carrick-Davies is a freelance trainer, writer and former CEO of internet charity Childnet International.

They inherited a business on the rebound from the worst advertising recession in living memory, and, as anyone who has followed ITV's fortunes will know, difficult questions do not tend to be asked when revenues are rising. Those questions are about the degree to which the management's long-term aim of reducing ITV's near total dependence on fickle advertising revenues has been fulfilled. To what extent is ITV becoming a company less dependent on luck and economic cycles it can do nothing about? The strategy \u2013 to diversify ITV's revenue streams, focusing on online, subscription services and especially production to drive growth is not new. Charles Allen and Michael Grade \u2013 the last two leaders of the company \u2013 offered investors almost word for word the same set of ideas. They just failed \u2013 admittedly in the face of much less benign commercial circumstances \u2013 to make any appreciable headway in delivering them. By contrast the commentary accompanying last week's annual results from ITV was clear \u2013 there was evidence that the company's five-year transformation plan was working. Growth was being driven by non-advertising revenues \u2013 up \u00a393m year on year \u2013 \"mainly due to revenue growth from UK and international studios businesses\". But look a little closer and you will see that fully one third of the increase in non-advertising revenue (\u00a331m) is accounted for by increased spending by ITV on its own productions \u2013 which might be a good thing in all sorts of ways but hardly signifies reduced dependency on advertising revenues overall. And while there is no doubt that ITV Studios is doing better \u2013 as indicated by the fact it now supplies 55% of ITV's commissioned programmes (up from 50% two years ago) it is in reality some way off being the engine of future growth the company desires. Take a peek at the profit numbers and that becomes even clearer. A total increase in international and domestic production revenues of \u00a366m \u2013 notwithstanding that half comes from the company itself \u2013 adds only \u00a32m of increased profit. In fact the most significant contributors to the reported rise in profits are a 1% increase in advertising revenues (\u00a315m), lower programming costs because of no football World Cup or equivalent tournament in 2011 (\u00a329m) and company cost savings (\u00a320m). All of which \u2013 in current earnings terms at least \u2013 leaves ITV still looking like the company it always was \u2013 a huge cash generator from advertising revenues when times are good. In fairness the transformation envisaged by Norman and Crozier is bound to take time. The question is how much time have they got? With the exception of the soaps most of ITV's ratings juggernauts are still owned by other companies. And while the aim of creating winning content, showcasing it on ITV and cashing in as it is sold or re-licensed around the world is genuine enough, making it happen is still problematic. Balancing any potential short-term drop in ratings \u2013 with the associated threat to revenues \u2013 if in-house commissions are favoured over outsiders was always going to be tricky. And as ITV's own commentary said they need to \"further strengthen the collaborative process between broadcast and studios\". For which you can safely read that although Norman and Crozier \u2013 both complete outsiders to the business \u2013 have recognised the problem, the age-old battles between commissioning and production are far from over. And then there is the pace of change. To become a contributor to the company's future earnings of sufficient scale to significantly reduce dependence on UK TV advertising a step change will be required. And if that is to happen soon, in addition to taking bigger risks by putting more in-house production on air, it will probably mean a major acquisition. But time is of the essence. Currently the company's main source of revenue \u2013 advertising \u2013 is albeit somewhat against expectations stable, and having very little debt and free cash on the balance sheet gives the company plenty of freedom to act. But history suggests that any downturn in advertising revenues is likely to reduce investor tolerance for big, new, profit reducing (even in the short-term) investments. Given the cyclical nature of these things and inclement economic times, Archie and Adam will need to get a move on for fear their luck runs out as they too fall foul of fickle advertising revenues.",

The Bread and Roses award for radical publishing \u2013 named after the slogan chanted in 1912 by striking textile workers in Massachusetts, who struck for \"bread, and for roses too\" \u2013 is looking for books \"informed by socialist, anarchist, environmental, feminist and anti-racist concerns\", which also \"inspire, support or report on political and/or personal change\". Run by the newly-formed Alliance of Radical Booksellers, the prize has no corporate sponsorship and believes it is the UK's only literary award with explicitly leftwing entry criteria. \"Radical publishing is going through a renaissance, making the establishment of the Bread and Roses award timely,\" said trustee Ross Bradshaw from Five Leaves Publishing, a literary and radical press. His fellow trustee Nik Gorecki, of Housmans Bookshop, added that \"the central involvement of radical bookshops in the establishment and running of the Bread and Roses award also really sets it apart from other book prizes\". Judges Michael Rosen, the poet and children's author, lecturer and feminist writer Nina Power and Writing on the Wall festival director Madeline Heneghan have chosen a shortlist of seven titles to compete for the inaugural Bread and Roses prize, which is worth \u00a31,000. Tim Gee's Counterpower looks at struggles from the suffrage movement to the Arab spring, David Graeber's Debt: The First 5,000 Years analyses the history of debt and Tweets from Tahrir, edited by Nadia Idle and Alex Nunns, collects the story of the Egyptian uprising through the tweets of those who rose. Jones's Chavs, Andy Merrifield's Magical Marxism, Laurie Penny's collection of her writing Penny Red and Nicholas Shaxson's expos\u00e9 of tax havens Treasure Islands complete the lineup. Organisers are hoping the Bread and Roses prize will bring radical non-fiction to a wider audience, as well as encouraging the publishing of more radical titles and rewarding \"exceptional\" work. \"Radical movements need radical books and we are delighted to be promoting the wonderful range of inspiring and informative books being published today, through the Bread and Roses prize,\" said award trustee Mandy Vere of News from Nowhere Bookshop. The winner will be announced on 1 May, International Workers' Day, at the Bread and Roses pub in Clapham, London. The shortlist Counterpower: Making Change Happen by Tim Gee Debt: The First 5,000 Years by David Graeber Tweets from Tahrir: Egypt's Revolution as it Unfolded, in the Words of the People Who Made It edited by Nadia Idle and Alex Nunns Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class by Owen Jones Magical Marxism: Subversive Politics and the Imagination by Andy Merrifield Penny Red: Notes from the New Age of Dissent by Laurie Penny Treasure Islands: Tax Havens and the Men who Stole the World by Nicholas Shaxson",

Jones's Chavs, Andy Merrifield's Magical Marxism, Laurie Penny's collection of her writing Penny Red and Nicholas Shaxson's expos\u00e9 of tax havens Treasure Islands complete the lineup.</p> <p>Organisers are hoping the Bread and Roses prize will bring radical non-fiction to a wider audience, as well as encouraging the publishing of more radical titles and rewarding \"exceptional\" work. \"Radical movements need radical books and we are delighted to be promoting the wonderful range of inspiring and informative books being published today, through the Bread and Roses prize,\" said award trustee Mandy Vere of <a href=\"http://newsfromnowhere.org.uk/\" title=\"\">News from Nowhere Bookshop</a>.</p> <p>The winner will be announced on 1 May, International Workers' Day, at the Bread and Roses pub in Clapham, London.</p> <h2>The shortlist</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9781780260327/counterpower-why-movements-succeed-and-fail\" title=\"\">Counterpower: Making Change Happen</a> by Tim Gee</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9781933633862/debt-the-first-years\" title=\"\">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</a> by David Graeber</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9781935928454/tweets-from-tahrir-egypts-revolution-as-it-unfolded-in-the-words-of-the-people-who-made-it\" title=\"\">Tweets from Tahrir: Egypt's Revolution as it Unfolded, in the Words of the People Who Made It</a> edited by Nadia Idle and Alex Nunns</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/society/9781844676965/chavs-the-demonization-of-the-working-class\" title=\"\">Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class</a> by Owen Jones</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9780745330594/magical-marxism-subversive-politics-and-the-imagination\" title=\"\">Magical Marxism: Subversive Politics and the Imagination</a> by Andy Merrifield</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9780745332086/penny-red-notes-from-the-new-age-of-dissent\" title=\"\">Penny Red: Notes from the New Age of Dissent</a> by Laurie Penny</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9781847921109/treasure-islands-tax-havens-and-the-men-who-stole-the-world\" title=\"\">Treasure Islands: Tax Havens and the Men who Stole the World</a> by Nicholas Shaxson</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's enough to make you choke on your slice of Mrs Patmore's fruit cake. Dame Maggie Smith might quit Downton Abbey. Or at least so reports today's Daily Mirror in an article based on reports on tvline.com. ITV bosses are apparently in a state of panic as Smith, who plays Dowager Countess of Grantham, arguably one of the biggest draws of Downton Abbey, has not signed a new contract. She is on board for series three, currently being filmed, but is hesitating to sign up for future appearances. According to online reports Michelle Dockery, who plays Lady Mary, and Hugh Bonneville, who plays Earl Grantham, have already signed their contracts. Elizabeth McGovern (Cora, Countess of Grantham), Joanne Froggatt (housemaid Anna) and Brendan Coyle (John Bates) have also put pen to paper. The two missing pieces of the puzzle are Smith and \u2013 heavens, Carson, why is this not a tabloid headline? \u2013 Dan Stevens, who plays Matthew \"Is this a tingle I feel in my legs?\" Crawley. The Mirror quotes a source as saying: \"It's hard to imagine the series without Maggie Smith or Dan Stevens involved in some way.\" Massive understatement. With her googly eyes, outlandish hats and outraged pout, Cousin Violet has been the cornerstone of Downton's success. She personifies the series' inimitably eccentric combination of gravitas and hilarity. Downton would not be Downton without her. American viewers adore her. I have always wondered if Julian Fellowes intuited this very early on and made a conscious choice to give her the most memorable one-liners. These ones are just from one episode: \"She's so slight a real necklace would flatten her.\" \"Don't be defeatist, dear, it's very middle class.\" \"Wasn't there a masked ball in Paris when cholera broke out?\" You can't see anyone else carrying off these lines. A lot depends on how Shirley MacLaine's role pans out in series three. MacLaine is playing Cora's Manhattanite socialite mother \u2013 and very at home she looks too in pictures leaked from the set. Does Downton have room for two matriarchs? Perhaps Smith is beginning to wonder. What's interesting is that it is Smith who is holding back \u2013 arguably there are other cast members with more to lose by over-committing themselves. The bigger surprise is that Dockery has said yes to more Downton. Has Fellowes told her what's in store for Lady Mary? The success of Downton in the US and Dockery's uber-glamorous appearances at the Emmys have fuelled speculation that she is the most likely to land a big Hollywood role on the back of the show's success. Maybe this signing shows that she would rather bide her time \u2013 and that she feels she has more to show with Lady Mary. Perhaps just as significant as Downton without Cousin Violet, would be Downton without Matthew. Because the Matthew and Mary inheritance-linked plotline has been the defining story of the entire concept. If Matthew Crawley isn't in the picture then surely that leaves Fellowes with a hole where Mary and Matthew's romance \u2013 and the family's future in the Abbey \u2013 should be? Without cousins Violet and Matthew I can't help but feel that we'd all be somewhat wasting our time.",

      "bodyText": "Since July last year, I have written three posts for this blog on the nature of science journalism. The first championed investigative science journalism examining the confluence of science, business and politics. The second and third were more pointed, and attempted to draw a sharp line between science \"journalism\" (contextualising, investigating and, at times, challenging science) and science \"communication\" (a public relations exercise). As a result of the three posts (particularly the latter two) I have been invited to participate in a public discussion at the Royal Institution on Tuesday 13 March, which will seek agreement between scientists and journalists on what both sides might do to improve the coverage of science. I am not entirely comfortable with the idea. Many of my colleagues are rather bored with the whole debate and I'm slightly nervous that I am going to be left dangling over a yapping pit of scientists baying for editorial blood (despite science writer Ed Yong's tweet, I take some comfort from the fact that he will be participating in the event). I also have very little to say about bad journalism \u2013 partly because others already critique poor reporting much better than I possibly could. All that I will add here is that I have seen little evidence to suggest that reporting of science is particularly bad when compared with other fields of journalism or that it is bad because of some special property that science but no other discipline possesses (every time someone cites \"the scientific method\" or \"peer review\" on Twitter or in the comments below in an effort to rebut this, I will personally kill a kitten). My interest, as the first post made clear, is in good science journalism. For good science journalism to happen, journalists must try to stay at arm's length from their sources and not, for example, run their story past their source prior to publication. Failing to remain at one-step-removed runs the risk of turning a piece of journalism into some drippy, flaccid piece of science communication. (For the record, I sometimes enjoy drippy, flaccid pieces of science communication). So I am suspicious of calls to \"fix\" science journalism and feel that setting \"benchmarks\" can exclude some great reporting. And I am especially wary of pallying up with scientists \u2013 our sources \u2013 in order to reach a cosy consensus on the issue. Nonetheless, that is exactly what I am going to do. And I would like your help. Why? His name is Paul Dacre. Giving evidence to the Leveson enquiry on 6 February, the Daily Mail's editor gamely defended a story that (wrongly) reported that switching on the light during a night-time lavatory visit might cause cancer. (By the way, if you haven't visited this website, you should). Dacre pointed out that the story was reworked wire copy from an agency that included a quote on the cancer link from one of the scientists involved in the study \u2013 which, incidentally, was on mice. He also suggests that a Daily Mail reporter might \"unfortunately\" have taken the key claim out of the scientist's quote and put it in the copy. Dacre is correct when he says that slapping agency copy onto the printed page is common practice. But he is wrong to imply that it constitutes acceptable journalistic practice. It does not. Worse, the implication that a desk reporter sensationalised wire copy that was already stretching the findings of a paper to breaking point is more than a little troubling. It is the very opposite of what a journalist should be doing when reporting science: asking questions and deflating exaggeration. Dacre's evidence alone did not convince me of the need to participate in the Royal Institution discussion. But it was a timely reminder of the junk reporting that is out there. So I humbly ask journalists and the interested public to make practical suggestions about what reporters or editors responsible for producing a science story might do to improve the standard of coverage. Please tell us, when making your suggestions, who you are or what you do, so that there is some useful context to your comments. Email, tweet or leave your ideas in the comments below. Please mind the trolls. In a post tomorrow, Dr Chris Chambers and colleagues from the School of Psychology at Cardiff University will give the scientists' perspective.

      "body": "<p>Since July last year, I have written three posts for this blog on the nature of science journalism. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/jul/08/science-journalism\" title=\"\">first</a> championed investigative science journalism examining the confluence of science, business and politics. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/sep/29/scientists-copy-check-stories\" title=\"\">second</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jan/17/scientists-journalism\" title=\"\">third</a> were more pointed, and attempted to draw a sharp line between science \"journalism\" (contextualising, investigating and, at times, challenging science) and science \"communication\" (a public relations exercise).</p> <p>As a result of the three posts (particularly the latter two) I have been invited to participate in <a href=\"http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayEvent&amp;id=1232\" title=\"\">a public discussion</a> at the Royal Institution on Tuesday 13 March, which will seek agreement between scientists and journalists on what both sides might do to improve the coverage of science.</p> <p>I am not entirely comfortable with the idea. Many of my colleagues are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/iansample/statuses/159374333763002370\" title=\"\">rather bored</a> with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/iansample/statuses/159562036190248960\" title=\"\">whole debate</a> and I'm slightly nervous that I am going to be left dangling over a yapping pit of scientists baying for editorial blood (despite science writer Ed Yong's tweet, I take some comfort from the fact that he will be participating in the event).</p> <p>I also have very little to say about bad journalism \u2013 partly because others <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/badscience\" title=\"\">already critique</a> poor reporting <a href=\"http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/\" title=\"\">much better</a> than I possibly could. All that I will add here is that I have seen little evidence to suggest that reporting of science is particularly bad when compared with other fields of journalism or that it is bad because of some special property that science but no other discipline possesses (every time someone cites \"the scientific method\" or \"peer review\" on Twitter or in the comments below in an effort to rebut this, I will personally kill a kitten).</p> <p>My interest, as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/jul/08/science-journalism\" title=\"\">first post</a> made clear, is in good science journalism. For good science journalism to happen, journalists must try to stay at arm's length from their sources and not, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/sep/29/scientists-copy-check-stories\" title=\"\">run their story past their source prior to publication</a>. Failing to remain at one-step-removed runs the risk of turning a piece of journalism into some drippy, flaccid piece of science communication. (For the record, I sometimes enjoy drippy, flaccid pieces of science communication).</p> <p>So I am suspicious of calls to \"fix\" science journalism and feel that setting \"benchmarks\" can exclude some <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/jul/04/ben-goldacre-study-dietary-news\" title=\"\">great reporting</a>. And I am especially wary of pallying up with scientists \u2013 our sources \u2013 in order to reach a cosy consensus on the issue.</p> <p>Nonetheless, that is exactly what I am going to do. And I would like your help. Why?</p> <p>His name is Paul Dacre. <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-6-February-20121.pdf\" title=\"\">Giving evidence</a> to the Leveson enquiry on 6 February, the Daily Mail's editor gamely defended <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1265277/Cancer-danger-night-time-trip-toilet.html\" title=\"\">a story</a> that (wrongly) reported that switching on the light during a night-time lavatory visit might cause cancer. (By the way, if you haven't visited <a href=\"http://kill-or-cure.heroku.com/\" title=\"\">this website</a>, you should).</p> <p>Dacre pointed out that the story was reworked wire copy from an agency that included a quote on the cancer link from one of the scientists involved in <a href=\"http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/cgc/article/S0165-4608%2809%2900640-2/abstract\" title=\"\">the study</a> \u2013 which, incidentally, was on mice. He also suggests that a Daily Mail reporter might \"unfortunately\" have taken the key claim out of the scientist's quote and put it in the copy.</p> <p>Dacre is correct when he says that slapping agency copy onto the printed page is common practice. But he is wrong to imply that it constitutes acceptable journalistic practice. <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=40117\" title=\"\">It does not</a>.

      "bodyText": "Heard the one about the hooker who was raised in Australia, has represented Scotland, now lives in France after a previous stint in New Zealand, and is now in contention to play for England in next year's World Cup? That is the colourful back story of Ian Henderson, the Catalan Dragons hooker who has persuaded the England coach Steve McNamara to select him in a 32-man elite training squad on the basis that he was born in Torquay. \"Ian approached me last season, we spoke in depth and did all the checks and he's going to be a big addition to the group,\" said McNamara. \"His form this year for the Catalans has been sensational.\" Henderson is the youngest of three brothers who were all born in Devon before their Scottish parents emigrated to Australia. All three have played in England \u2013 Andrew with Castleford and Gateshead, Kevin with Wakefield, and Ian in the Bradford team who won the Super League Grand Final in 2005. They then teamed up for Scotland for the first time in the 2008 World Cup in Australia. Henderson is joined in the squad by another member of Scotland's 2008 World Cup squad, the Huddersfield scrum-half Danny Brough, who switched allegiances after that competition. \"Danny's got his spark back,\" said McNamara, having omitted him from last year's Four Nations squad. Rangi Chase, Castleford's Maori stand-off and reigning Man of Steel who was a shock inclusion last year, is the only other import in this squad. McNamara will not seek to recall any of the seven England-qualified players who are now based in Australia \u2013 James Graham, Gareth Ellis, Jack Reed, Chris Heighington and the three Burgess brothers at South Sydney \u2013 for the two International Origin games in June and July against an Exiles team drawn from the overseas players employed in the Super League. But at least five of them, fitness permitting \u2013 Graham, Ellis, Reed, Heighington and Sam Burgess \u2014 would seem certain to link up with the squad for a triangular series against Wales and France at the end of the season in October and November. Other notable inclusions in the elite training squad are Gareth Hock, the Wigan forward who returned from a two-year drug suspension last summer, and a quartet of young backs Josh Charnley, Zak Hardaker, Jonny Lomax and Kallum Watkins, all of whom are uncapped at senior international level. Warrington's centre Ryan Atkins is the most surprising omission after his impressive start to the season, and there is no place either for Luke Robinson, the Huddersfield hooker who agreed to postpone his marriage to join the Four Nations tour of 2010, or Henderson's new Catalans team-mate Leon Pryce. They were presumably too experienced to be considered for a developmental 24-man England Knights squad who will join the senior squad in a series of camps in Loughborough ahead of a mid-season game against Ireland, and the Knights will face Ireland again in the autumn in the Al Italia Cup, which also includes Scotland and Italy. England elite training squad Carl Ablett (Leeds), Ryan Bailey (Leeds), Chris Bridge (Warrington), Tom Briscoe (Hull), Danny Brough (Huddersfield), Rob Burrow (Leeds), Garreth Carvell (Warrington), Josh Charnley (Wigan), Rangi Chase (Castleford), Eorl Crabtree (Huddersfield), Leroy Cudjoe (Huddersfield), Ryan Hall (Leeds), Zak Hardaker (Leeds), Ian Henderson (Catalan Dragons), Gareth Hock (Wigan), Ben Jones-Bishop (Leeds) Jamie Jones-Buchanan (Leeds), Jonny Lomax (St Helens), Danny McGuire (Leeds), Michael McIlorum (Wigan), Adrian Morley (Warrington), Lee Mossop (Wigan), Sean O'Loughlin (Wigan), Jamie Peacock (Leeds, captain), James Roby (St Helens), Kevin Sinfield (Leeds), Sam Tomkins (Wigan), Kallum Watkins (Leeds), Kris Welham (Hull KR), Ben Westwood (Warrington), Jon Wilkin (St Helens), Kirk Yeaman (Hull).

      "bodyText": "Over the past few months popular support for Egypt's ruling military council (Scaf) has plummeted. While the anti-Scaf sentiment may seem a welcome development to those in the pro-democracy camp, under the surface it reflects a rather disturbing notion of what some Egyptians expect of their rulers. While some criticise Scaf for its authoritarian attitudes, others criticise it for not being authoritarian enough. The latter faction complain about Scaf's inability to clamp down on chaos, the erosion of state authority or what is sometimes referred to as the loss of \"state prestige\". Egypt's fear of chaos defines its yearning for stability and strong leadership. The popular Arabic maxim \"Better one hundred years of tyranny than one day of chaos\" captures much of the region's internalised fear of change, and has allowed regional rulers to paint themselves as custodians of stability. Moreover, the leaderless nature of the uprisings has only reinforced the potential for disorder and fuelled anxiety. In the coming months Egyptians will get a chance to choose their president. How they will base their choice may create challenges for the country's future. Conventional attitudes towards authority, justice and national identity could undermine democracy and derail the country's path towards freedom. In a recent interview, the head of the ultra-conservative Islamist Nour party explained that Egyptians need a man who \"can gather the nation around a strong national feeling that can get Egypt out of the crisis it is in\". This thirst for a populist saviour is not only unrealistic but also risks inviting authoritarianism. Populism enables a leader to directly address the masses and speak in their name, thus bypassing representative institutions and opposition parties. Nascent democracies, such as Egypt, that lack the established checks and balances on executive power are particularly vulnerable. The French sociologist, \u00c9mile Durkheim, argued that societies wanted their leaders to be god-like . This allows them to shed responsibility for difficult decisions and scapegoat their leader for any failures. In extreme cases, however, the populist leader acquires a personality cult and is adulated by followers who are incapable of evaluating him based on his actions. One example was the public reaction to Gamal Abdel Nasser's resignation in the wake of the 1967 defeat at the hands of Israel. Despite the national humiliation and the massive loss of life, tens of thousands of Egyptians poured into the streets demanding that Nasser remain their leader. The desire for heroic leadership in a nation where \"personal freedom\" remains an alien concept makes Egypt's democratic transition even more risky. In fact, subordination of individual liberties for the sake of national security, economic recovery or some other collective good is one of the reasons why Egyptians have a skewed sense of justice. Crimes such as torture and even murder seem disturbingly acceptable to the public conscience in the face of national threat. Additionally, the patriarchal nature of society has allowed the regime to franchise repression. As historian Hisham Sharabi described it, the whole of Arab society was built around the \"dominance of the father\". Whether it's at the family level or in politics, paternal will is absolute and \"is maintained by a forced consensus based on ritual and coercion\". As a result, society has sustained certain prejudices about age. The subordination of Egypt's young adults is seen in all areas of public life and has resulted in what could be termed a gerontocracy. Most Egyptians would regard the youth that brought about change as too immature, not to be trusted to lead the country. This is ironic in a country whose archetypal leader, Nasser, was only 38 when he first came to power. But more than anything else, religion as a source of national identity has played a defining role in determining the country's path so far. Arguments about the state's Islamic identity as stipulated in the constitution have drummed up anxieties towards change and set the stage for an overwhelming Islamist victory. At least two presidential candidates identify themselves as Islamist. Today if one looks at the make-up of Egypt's recently elected parliament these concerns immediately come to life. With approximately 60% of the population under the age of 30, Egypt's parliament is dominated by more senior members, despite having reduced the age of candidacy to 25. Women who were at the forefront of the revolution only managed to secure nine of the 498 seats that were up for grabs. The same applies to Egypt's Christians who won only two seats. After decades of oppression, poverty and societal isolation, traditional attitudes are riddled with biases and misconceptions that have frequently been the subject of exploitation by the regime and its propaganda machine. These problems are not unique to Egypt and nascent democracies elsewhere have faced similar challenges. For democracy to succeed, Egyptians need to focus on creating independent institutions, raising political awareness and creating a constitution that unequivocally protects the rights of citizens and puts tabs on government coercion. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

In extreme cases, however, the populist leader acquires a personality cult and is adulated by followers who are incapable of evaluating him based on his actions.</p> <p>One example was the public reaction to Gamal Abdel Nasser's resignation in the wake of the 1967 defeat at the hands of Israel. Despite the national humiliation and the massive loss of life, tens of thousands of Egyptians poured into the streets demanding that Nasser remain their leader.</p> <p>The desire for heroic leadership in a nation where \"personal freedom\" remains an alien concept makes Egypt's democratic transition even more risky. In fact, subordination of individual liberties for the sake of national security, economic recovery or some other collective good is one of the reasons why Egyptians have a skewed sense of justice. Crimes such as torture and even murder seem disturbingly acceptable to the public conscience in the face of national threat.</p> <p>Additionally, the patriarchal nature of society has allowed the regime to franchise repression. <a href=\"http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/ComparativePolitics/MiddleEast/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195079135\" title=\"\">As historian Hisham Sharabi described it</a>, the whole of Arab society was built around the \"dominance of the father\". Whether it's at the family level or in politics, paternal will is absolute and \"is maintained by a forced consensus based on ritual and coercion\".</p> <p>As a result, society has sustained certain prejudices about age. The subordination of Egypt's young adults is seen in all areas of public life and has resulted in what could be termed a gerontocracy. Most Egyptians would regard the youth that brought about change as too immature, not to be trusted to lead the country. This is ironic in a country whose archetypal leader, Nasser, was only 38 when he first came to power.</p> <p>But more than anything else, religion as a source of national identity has played a defining role in determining the country's path so far. Arguments about the state's Islamic identity as stipulated in the constitution have drummed up anxieties towards change and set the stage for an overwhelming Islamist victory. At least two presidential candidates identify themselves as Islamist.</p> <p>Today if one looks at the make-up of Egypt's recently elected parliament these concerns immediately come to life. With approximately 60% of the population under the age of 30, Egypt's parliament is dominated by more senior members, despite having reduced the age of candidacy to 25. Women who were at the forefront of the revolution only managed to secure nine of the 498 seats that were up for grabs. The same applies to Egypt's Christians who won only two seats.</p> <p>After decades of oppression, poverty and societal isolation, traditional attitudes are riddled with biases and misconceptions that have frequently been the subject of exploitation by the regime and its propaganda machine. These problems are not unique to Egypt and nascent democracies elsewhere have faced similar challenges.</p> <p>For democracy to succeed, Egyptians need to focus on creating independent institutions, raising political awareness and creating a constitution that unequivocally protects the rights of citizens and puts tabs on government coercion.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>",

So the news from the World Health Organisation and Unicef joint monitoring programme that the world has met the drinking water target of the millennium development goals is very welcome. Since 1990 over 2 billion more people in the world have received access to drinking water. And this progress has not been driven by just big middle-income countries \u2013 smaller, less well-endowed countries have also shown the way. Even in sub-Saharan Africa, where progress towards achieving the target is off-track, 273 million additional people gained access to drinking water since 1990. So, we should raise our hats to the governments, organisations, communities and individuals who put great effort and resources into making this happen. They show that where there is a will, it is possible to truly transform the lives of hundreds of millions of people for the better. However 783 million people still do not have access to drinking water, this most basic human right. That is more than one in 10 people in the world. It is perhaps particularly depressing when one considers who these people are, where they live, and the impact this has on their lives. In addition, the other part of the same millennium development goal target \u2013 relating to access to adequate sanitation \u2013 is still off track. Nowhere are the inequities of this world clearer than in access to drinking water and basic sanitation. Unicef is convinced that focusing on the poorest and hardest to reach is the fairest and most cost-effective way to use the donations we receive. It is the only way we will achieve the vision of the Millennium Declaration, reinforced by the UN general assembly's recent recognition of drinking water and sanitation as basic human rights. The majority of people without access to drinking water \u2013 479 million \u2013 live in countries that are not among the poorest. The country with the largest number of people without access to improved water \u2013 119 million \u2013 is China, the world's second largest economy, according to most estimates. The next highest number \u2013 97 million \u2013 live in India, another burgeoning and vibrant economy, followed by 66 million people in Nigeria. This still leaves another 304 million people in the so-called least developed countries (LDCs), which need significant assistance to confront this huge challenge. But one of the most inspiring findings from this report is that several smaller and poorer countries have made significant contributions to global progress. This tells us that results can be truly transformational given the right conditions, the right kind of external assistance, and allocating resources to the right kinds of things. Take Malawi, for instance, an LDC. Since 1995, this small country provided more than 7.2 million of its people \u2013 almost half its current population \u2013 with access to drinking water. Burkina Faso and the Gambia, also both LDCs, have achieved similar feats. This shows we need to redouble our efforts to ensure the poorest countries have the technical guidance and information necessary to set the right conditions for achieving results, and to allocate resources accordingly. In April, Unicef and the World Bank are convening a meeting of finance ministers from developing countries and ministers of development co-operation from donor countries on behalf of the Sanitation and Water for All partnership to prioritise drinking water and sanitation. This is a huge opportunity for many more countries to move from stagnation or incremental progress to transformational change in less than a generation. It can be done. Three thousand children dying each day is 3,000 too many. No child should be excluded from global progress. \u2022 Sanjay Wijesekera is chief of water, sanitation and hygiene for Unicef, New York",

      "bodyText": "More than a third of recent graduates are employed in low-skilled jobs, official figures show. In the final quarter of 2011, 35.9% of those who had graduated from university in the previous six years were employed in lower-skilled occupations, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. This compares with 26.7%, or just over one in four, in 2001. In the same period, the number of recent graduates in the jobs market has grown by 438,000 to around 1.5 million in 2011. Jobs categorised as low-skilled by the ONS include hotel porters, waiters and bar staff, and retail assistants. Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students, said: \"These figures will understandably make grim reading for many students and graduates who see their opportunities limited, but the expansion of higher education and long-term investment in our future is infinitely preferable to a growing dole queue and a higher benefits bill.\" The figures, taken from the Labour Force Survey, show that graduates still retain an advantage over non-graduates in the jobs market. By October 2011, 86% of all graduates were in work compared with 72.3% of non-graduates. Graduates are also likely to have significantly more earning power than non-graduates. In 2011, the median hourly rate of pay for all graduates aged 21 to 64 was \u00a315.18, 70% more than the non-graduate rate of \u00a38.92. Medicine and dentistry were the best-paid careers for recent graduates, with a median hourly wage of \u00a321.29. Arts jobs ranked the lowest with a median hourly rate of \u00a312.06. Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, said: \"The recession has hit the job prospects of recent graduates but they are still nearly 20% more likely to be in work than people without degrees. A lack of high-quality jobs has forced more graduates into lower-skilled jobs over the last decade. \"Raising the skills of UK workers must be accompanied with an industrial strategy focused on boosting high-value industries such as manufacturing. Otherwise public investment in education and the talents of UK graduates will be wasted.\" Those leaving university either during or immediately after the recession continue to struggle. The rate of unemployment among those graduating since 2010 stands at 18.9%, or just under one in five, a slight improvement on last year's figures. Tanya de Grunwald, founder of the website Graduate Fog which campaigns for paid graduate internships, claimed the real picture could be even worse, because the Labour Force Survey does not take into account the high number of graduates doing unpaid placements without the guarantee of a salaried job afterwards. \"We must ask whether it is right that schools, politicians and universities are still urging so many young people to do a degree, when many will later discover it was not a wise investment for them,\" said De Grunwald, who estimates that around 250,000 graduates every year undertake unpaid internships. \"There is growing evidence that unpaid internships no longer lead to paid jobs and that now, they are actually replacing them.\" Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, which represents many of the country's biggest employers, said that while the survey demonstrated the competitive nature of the graduate jobs market, graduates should try to look at the bigger picture. \"Studies have shown that over a period of years graduates do gravitate towards the job for which they believe their degree has prepared them,\" he said. \"My advice for graduates is to have both a short-term and long-term approach to planning their careers; to gain experience in the workplace and see it as a valuable stepping stone towards their longer term career goals. \"AGR members believe a degree remains a valuable and worthwhile investment, and this report demonstrates this.\" The figures show how all UK regions have experienced growth in the graduate population over the last decade. London has the highest concentration, with 49% of the population of the capital having studied for a degree, up 15% since 2001. Scotland has the next highest proportion of graduates (40%), followed by the south-east (39%). At the other end of the scale, less than 30% of those living in Northern Ireland, Yorkshire and Humberside and the West Midlands are graduates. Case study Amy Cox, 21, from Reading, graduated in 2011 with a 2.1 in history from Goldsmiths, University of London I finished my course in May and immediately started doing an full-time, unpaid internship for a non-profit arts organisation for five months. They led me to believe I would get a job out of it, which was why I stuck with it for so long. In the end what they offered me was so badly paid that I wouldn't have been able to support myself in London, so I had to decline. My parents supported me until September, but after that I had to move back in with them in Reading, which is where I am now. I'd always really wanted a career in museum or arts curating, but there's always someone out there who's done one more internship than you. I didn't get a single interview, so I've basically given up on that now. I'm just looking for anything in PR, marketing or media that might come up. To be honest I couldn't put a figure on how many jobs I've applied for, but it's a lot. Since I broadened my search I've had a couple of interviews, one over the phone. But neither has come to anything. I've just done some more unpaid work experience for a digital advertising network, which went well, so now I'm thinking about looking in that direction. I can't really fault the university. One of my lecturers had experienced a long period of unemployment and set up careers workshops, hammering home to us how hard it was. But nobody I know who did my course is doing a job they want to be doing. They're all waiters, or working in shops. While I'm living at home, I'm working an hour and a half a day as a lunchtime supervisor in a local primary school. I don't claim any benefits; if you do, you have that pressure on you to apply for everything. And I want to hold out a little bit longer for something that I wouldn't mind doing. I'm lucky my parents are still supporting me, but I know I can't carry on like this. Eventually, it will get to the stage where I just end up taking anything.",

The rate of unemployment among those graduating since 2010 stands at 18.9%, or just under one in five, a slight improvement on last year's figures.</p> <p>Tanya de Grunwald, founder of the website <a href=\"http://www.graduatefog.co.uk/\" title=\"Graduate Fog homepage\">Graduate Fog</a> which campaigns for paid graduate internships, claimed the real picture could be even worse, because the Labour Force Survey does not take into account the high number of graduates doing unpaid placements without the guarantee of a salaried job afterwards.</p> <p>\"We must ask whether it is right that schools, politicians and universities are still urging so many young people to do a degree, when many will later discover it was not a wise investment for them,\" said De Grunwald, who estimates that around 250,000 graduates every year undertake unpaid internships.</p> <p>\"There is growing evidence that unpaid internships no longer lead to paid jobs and that now, they are actually replacing them.\"</p> <p>Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, which represents many of the country's biggest employers, said that while the survey demonstrated the competitive nature of the graduate jobs market, graduates should try to look at the bigger picture.</p> <p>\"Studies have shown that over a period of years graduates do gravitate towards the job for which they believe their degree has prepared them,\" he said.</p> <p>\"My advice for graduates is to have both a short-term and long-term approach to planning their careers; to gain experience in the workplace and see it as a valuable stepping stone towards their longer term career goals.</p> <p>\"AGR members believe a degree remains a valuable and worthwhile investment, and this report demonstrates this.\"</p> <p>The figures show how all UK regions have experienced growth in the graduate population over the last decade. London has the highest concentration, with 49% of the population of the capital having studied for a degree, up 15% since 2001. Scotland has the next highest proportion of graduates (40%), followed by the south-east (39%).</p> <p>At the other end of the scale, less than 30% of those living in Northern Ireland, Yorkshire and Humberside and the West Midlands are graduates.</p> <h2><strong>Case study</strong></h2> <p><strong>Amy Cox, 21, from Reading, graduated in 2011 with a 2.1 in history from Goldsmiths, University of London </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386970209\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/3/6/1331048196474/Graduate-Amy-Cox-007.jpg\" alt=\"Graduate Amy Cox\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Frank Baron for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I finished my course in May and immediately started doing an full-time, unpaid internship for a non-profit arts organisation for five months. They led me to believe I would get a job out of it, which was why I stuck with it for so long.</p> <p>In the end what they offered me was so badly paid that I wouldn't have been able to support myself in London, so I had to decline. My parents supported me until September, but after that I had to move back in with them in Reading, which is where I am now.</p> <p>I'd always really wanted a career in museum or arts curating, but there's always someone out there who's done one more internship than you. I didn't get a single interview, so I've basically given up on that now. I'm just looking for anything in PR, marketing or media that might come up.</p> <p>To be honest I couldn't put a figure on how many jobs I've applied for, but it's a lot. Since I broadened my search I've had a couple of interviews, one over the phone. But neither has come to anything. I've just done some more unpaid work experience for a digital advertising network, which went well, so now I'm thinking about looking in that direction.</p> <p>I can't really fault the university. One of my lecturers had experienced a long period of unemployment and set up careers workshops, hammering home to us how hard it was. But nobody I know who did my course is doing a job they want to be doing. They're all waiters, or working in shops.</p> <p>While I'm living at home, I'm working an hour and a half a day as a lunchtime supervisor in a local primary school. I don't claim any benefits; if you do, you have that pressure on you to apply for everything. And I want to hold out a little bit longer for something that I wouldn't mind doing.</p> <p>I'm lucky my parents are still supporting me, but I know I can't carry on like this. Eventually, it will get to the stage where I just end up taking anything.</p>",

They also make big money: it's estimated that Cats and Les Mis\u00e9rables between them have taken more than three-quarters of a billion pounds at the box office. Why then, even in a week when the Critics' Circle is poised to give Stephen Sondheim a lifetime achievement award, do I persist in thinking the musical is a form in crisis? For a start, let's look more closely at the shows currently on in London. Several of them \u2013 The Phantom of the Opera, Les Mis\u00e9rables, Blood Brothers \u2013 are part of the theatrical landscape. Many others, such as Ghost, Shrek, The Lion King, Singin' in the Rain, The Wizard of Oz and Billy Elliot \u2013 derive from existing film hits. The others can be classified either as jukebox musicals (We Will Rock You, Rock of Ages, Thriller, Jersey Boys) or revivals of established classics (Sweeney Todd). That leaves one genuinely new \"book musical\", Matilda, which, although based on a Roald Dahl novel, does not derive either from a movie or a composer's songbook. I'm not saying that any of the above shows are bad or don't deserve their popularity \u2013 far from it. But there's something unhealthy about a genre that persistently fails to generate exciting new work. I haven't been to New York in some time so I can't pronounce on the merits of acclaimed show The Book of Mormon. I also missed London Road at the National which I'm assured opened up new possibilities for the verbatim musical. But I did see Betty Blue Eyes in the West End, which I thought improved on the Alan Bennett it sprang from, and which had a first-rate score and lyrics by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe. Lacking showbiz pizzazz or a big star, it nonetheless had a depressingly short run. This is the real problem. There seems little room any more for a musical that is not some form of cultural juggernaut or that trades on wit, lightness and charm. As a student in the late 1950s, I remember coming up to London to write a piece on musicals and delighting in such shows as Frank Loesser's The Most Happy Fella and David Heneker's Make Me An Offer, which hailed from Stratford East. At that time I also assiduously collected LPs of Broadway hits such as Leonard Bernstein's On the Town and Wonderful Town (about to be revived at the Lowry in Salford). But those happy days when the musical was a source of innocent pleasure seem far off. Nowadays musicals have become so industrial in scale and expensive to produce that any form of risk has to be minimised fom the start. Like the banks, musicals have become too big to fail. What can be done? I recently wrote a magazine article suggesting that prohibitive production costs were stifling the emergence of new talent. I proposed that an enlightened producer such as Cameron Mackintosh might subsidise an annual public showcase for new musicals: something like the old Royal Court \"productions without decor\", where the money went on the talent rather than on sets and costumes. Imagine my astonishment when Cameron bustled up to me recently at a big social do and said he had been planning just such a venture for some time. It's early days yet but Cameron's idea seems to me the only way of rescuing a form in crisis. Musicals continue to pour off the assembly line: there is talk of a Spice Girls show and of new versions of hit movies such as The Bodyguard and The Commitments. But none of this is breathtakingly original. And, unless the musical can discover new composers and lyricists to succeed the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Stephen Sondheim generation, it will soon become a glittering coffin.",

The maddening thing, however, is that the coalition would have had the perfect instrument to target family allowances away from the rich \u2013 had it not chosen to abolish this. Before explaining how, it is necessary to step back and consider the big idea behind the child benefit policy. Namely, withdrawing payments for those who can get by without them, while protecting the so-called squeezed middle. It is a principle that Clegg reaffirmed, and one with wider potential application across the cuts debate. My colleague Polly Toynbee holds up her free older person's travel pass as an example of a freebie ripe for the chopping, and certain Liberal Democrat ministers have the winter fuel payments of warm and comfortable pensioners in their sights. But even before the retrenchment there was a quest to find a middle way between universalism and aggressively means-tested payments. During New Labour's days Harriet Harman talked about \"affluence testing\", which is what Gordon Brown's tax credits eventually did. Their engineer-in-chief was Ed Miliband, who used the clunky phrase \"progressive universalism\" to describe an architecture that targeted big payments at the poor while also drawing a wider swath of society into the system through a modest flat-rate payment of around \u00a310 a week. This was only gradually tapered away when household earnings went some way north of \u00a350,000. The credits eventually achieved good take-up rates, the traditional weak point of benefits for the working poor. If we weren't saddled with a political culture in which politicians feel obliged to rubbish the other side, the coalition might have outright abolished child benefit while greatly increasing the flat-rate element of the tax credits. That would protect the poor and the middle, withdraw cash from the rich, while also treating dual- and single-earner families equitably \u2013 seeing as everything would be assessed for households as a whole. Unfortunately, after the Conservatives and the Lib Dems had spent years ridiculing the credits for \"ensnaring\" families on decent pay in a \"creaking\" means test they were moved to abolish the flat-rate credit immediately on taking office. Their rhetoric then was of simplication, but it has now run aground on the complexities of the real world. Months after axing the one proper affluence test in the system, the coalition resolved to take child benefit from any parent in the higher tax bracket, which is a desperately crude affluence test. It leads to those anomalies about which the coalition now frets \u2013 the fact that a couple on \u00a340,000 each will get full child benefit while a sole earner on \u00a345,000 will get nothing; and the financial cliff edge that parents will fall over where a pay rise pushes them up a tax band. The coalition may taper the benefit gradually \u2013 but only by spending money, and introducing yet another means test. Preventing single-earning couples from being punished will be harder. Solutions are possible, but these rely on collecting information to link the earnings details of both parents \u2013 information that might have been collected for tax credit purposes, but which will not often be collected now. And this is a policy due to come into force in months. By rushing to abolish a \"creaking\" tax credit structure without thinking about what happened next, the government has left itself up a particularly nasty creek \u2013 and without a paddle.

      "bodyText": "This article is the subject of a complaint made by agents acting on behalf of Sally Morgan Enterprises Ltd. Psychic Sally has done it again. By which I do not mean that she has (or has ever) committed fraud, lied or cheated, but rather that she has inspired yet another article raising interesting questions about how she performs her apparent psychic shows. Just to recap, the first article was by Professor Chris French, a psychologist at Goldsmith College, London. On this website, he outlined allegations that Sally might have used an earpiece at her Dublin show last September in order to receive messages from an assistant. Sally robustly denied any suggestion that she might be cheating, and went on to sue the Daily Mail for libel because of an article on a similar theme by the magician and ex-\"psychic\" Paul Zenon. My understanding is that the Mail is standing by the article and has already submitted a defence. The second article, a blog by me, pointed out how review ratings of Sally's shows appeared to plummet after the Dublin incident. Was the decline in Sally's performance linked to what happened in Dublin? Was it due to the spirits going into hibernation? Or was it something else? The latest article appeared soon after she appeared in Edinburgh on 23 February. It was written by Drew McAdam, who had been asked to review Psychic Sally's show for the Edinburgh Evening News. Drew regularly reviews music and theatre shows, and he also has a background in mentalism and magic. He even has a show that mimics the sort of effects that Sally presents, except Drew stresses that he is \"as psychic as a teapot\". In his blog, Drew explains that he was one of just a handful of people fortunate enough to receive a reading during the Edinburgh show. The reading related to someone called Toby who had been killed in a bomb explosion. It was a particularly disturbing and dramatic reading, but it meant a lot to Drew's wife, who was also in the audience and stood with Drew when the reading occurred. Drew's wife had been in love with Toby. Drew had tried his absolute best to have this reading come through, inasmuch as he had emailed details of Toby and how he died to Sally's website and had left notes (so-called \"love letters\") in a box in the foyer just before the show. Skeptics might wonder if Sally had access to this information and used it as a basis for her reading, while believers will assume that Toby's spirit was stood next to Sally that night. You might not have made up your mind yet whether you're a believer or not, but one extra piece of information might help. Toby was a fictional character. Drew's email and love letters were based on the death of Toby Wren in the 1970 BBC science fiction drama Doomwatch. You can watch online the scene in which Toby is killed in an explosion. When I asked Drew why he had gone to the trouble of submitting information about a fictional character, he replied: \"Having been friends with Paul Zenon for a number of years, I was well aware of his trials and tribulations following his article about Sally Morgan in the Mail and the resulting legal action \u2013 and we had discussed a number of techniques that psychics could employ to give the impression they were picking up psychic thoughts or information from the dead, and how we could test whether these methods might be used by particular performers. Being a professional mindreader, and so being aware of such techniques about which the public know very little, I thought it would be fun to try a little experiment. It was for this reason that I used the idea of producing some spurious information based on a fictional TV series \u2013 something really quite light-hearted. It was a bit of a lark.\" I should stress at this point that Drew is not stating that Sally cheated. He is simply outlining his experiment, and the result is open to interpretation. I also asked Drew's wife, Elizabeth McAdam, for her account of what happened: \"I completed some letters to my love Toby Wren. I gave all the information I thought Sally would need, such as name and cause of death. When the interval was approaching Sally said she could see a horrific death and wasn't sure if she would share it or not because it involved a terrible scene of an explosion. \"But after the interval she did. She said she saw someone being blown up in an explosion. Two ladies stood up and Sally asked why they thought the message was theirs. They replied that their neighbours' son Mark had been blown up in Afghanistan by an IED [improvised explosive device]. Sally said no, that the message was from someone else. \"Did anyone recognise the name Tobin? I stood up to be asked why I thought it was for me. I said that my friend had been blown up diffusing a bomb, and his name was Toby. She told me that it definitely was me and that she could see him crouched down leaning over the bomb. She also mentioned about seeing a body being blasted up into the air. \"She told me how sad she felt. 'Oh, darling I'm so sorry. What a way to die.' I hadn't written on my love letter that Toby Wren was a character from the BBC programme Doomwatch, who I had fallen totally in love with as a 13-year-old. He was played by Robert Powell. I cried for days when Toby was blown up defusing a bomb on a pier. He did however rise again as Jesus of Nazareth.\" After reading Drew's blog, I tried to check what had happened. I have emails from two of Drew's colleagues confirming that he had planted or was about to plant messages about Toby for Sally. I also have a Facebook exchange from 17 February confirming his plan. In addition I have talked to an independent person in the audience, who confirms that Drew's blog is a fair account of what happened on stage. I have also asked Sally's office if Drew's blog is a fair account of what happened, but she has not responded to this question or offered any comment. My attempts to get a response from her solicitors have also drawn a blank. I am curious to know if Sally thinks it is possible to contact the spirit of a fictional character, or if she coincidentally contacted the spirit of a real person whose life and death matched the experiences of Toby Wren, or if there is an alternative explanation. So where does this leave us? I, along with Merseyside Skeptics and Professor Chris French, have offered to test Sally and try to end the controversy. Perhaps not surprisingly, Sally declined this opportunity to clear up the issue. As a result of this and the recent incidents described above, I think it is fair to say that her reputation has suffered over the past six months. Sally has already admitted to crossing the line into grey areas, as outlined in the Independent. In 2007, on the way to conduct a reading with Big Brother winner Brian Dowling for her TV show, Sally was asked if she knew him. She merely replied: \"I know of him.\" However, it later transpired that she had done a reading for Dowling two years earlier. When confronted by the allegation, Sally blamed it on her director for telling her what to say. You can find the second reading on YouTube and judge for yourself whether or not Sally should have been more honest. I started trawling YouTube to find other readings by Sally. Although I have watched several readings, so far I have only contacted one of the people who received a psychic reading from Sally. Unfortunately for Sally, the result was not very flattering in terms of her methods or her transparency. The clip concerns a group of free runners known as Urban Free Flow. One of the free runners is Ben Milner and he apparently experiences a stunning piece of mediumship just a few minutes into the clip. The clip shows Sally asking: \"Why am I looking at your mum all the time, is there a problem with your mum?\" Ben explains that she passed away last year. Sally gives Ben some advice, and then out of the blue she says: \"Jean wants to send her love.\" This turns out to be the name of Ben's mother. He smiles, looks down, turns and walks away. Sally suggests that Ben is upset, and this certainly makes sense to anyone viewing the clip. However, when I spoke to Ben, he said the editing does not truly reflect his recollection of the sequence of events. According to Ben, the cameras stopped rolling before this part of the reading. He was ready to leave when Sally asked if the name Jean mean anything. Jean might have been a girlfriend, colleague, sister, cousin, next door neighbour, hairdresser \u2026 or mother \u2026 or nobody. A skeptic might suggest that Sally was throwing out a random name in the hope of a lucky response. In other words, she might have been on a small fishing expedition. By contrast, a believer might say that Sally was being guided by the spirit world. Ben explained, while the cameras were not rolling, that Jean was his mother's name and that she had died last year. Sally suggested that they start recording again, at which point we see her regurgitating the information as if it came from the spirit world. She does not hint that much of the information came from Ben off-camera. In fact, when Sally suggests that Ben is upset after he turns away, he told me he was actually grinning in partial disbelief at what had just happened. This incident might be a one-off, so I am keen to get a bigger picture of what goes on behind the scenes of Sally's TV readings. If Sally has read for you then please do get in touch. Positive or negative experience? Convinced or suspicious? Celebrity or noble citizen? Believer or skeptic? Please let me know what it was like when Sally read for you. Update: on 20 June 2013 Sally Morgan successfully settled her libel action against publishers of the Daily Mail, who withdrew the suggestion that she used a secret earpiece at her Dublin show in September 2011 to receive messages from off-stage, thereby cheating her audience, and accepted that the allegation is untrue.

      "bodyText": "The first thing to marvel at is that this record was ever commercially released: it is no more than a music teacher with a group of elementary school children singing around a piano. What makes it remarkable is the conjunction of the times (1969-70), an inspiring educator and some spirited kids from upstate New York. On compilations, such as the excellent Black and Proud Vol 1, this song is often credited to Ghetto Reality, although in fact that is the name of the LP by Nancy Dupree on which it originally appeared. Dupree was dissatisfied with the songs she was expected to teach her charges and so introduced them to a diet of Miriam Makeba, Nina Simone and Odetta, adapting and rewriting songs so that, in her words, \"they had meaning for US\". From there she and the children took to creating their own compositions. James Brown was one such song, composed, Dupree wrote, on the Monday after her pupils had been to see the Godfather of Soul play in their hometown of Rochester and the children were \"still full of the sight, sound and feel\" of their idol. The song contains just two verses of brilliant economy. The first describes Brown's rise from poverty to stardom; the second sums up a decade of developing black consciousness in two lines about the singer's changing hairstyle. The fact that it's sung by children seems to capture some of the positivity of the time as well as adding a trebly edge to a few of James Brown's trademark interjections (\"Uh! With your bad self!\"). The album has other moments of slightly unnerving precocity, including a song about what the kids want for Christmas that features a chorus of pubescent girls carolling: \"I want a man; I want a black man. Just like Malcolm. Hey, hey, hey!\" According to her daughter, Dupree secured the LP's release on Folkways by buttonholing the label's founder, Moses Asch, for the duration of an aeroplane flight they happened to share. A year after making this record, though, Dupree was fired from Rochester's School No 4. It seems the immediate cause was her refusal to wear high heels but it's not hard to imagine her radical, black feminist politics and refusal to toe the line were the underlying reason. Over the next decade, she wrote plays, recorded two albums of poetry and became a Black Panther. She died of leukaemia, aged only 44, in 1980. Some may feel only a parent could love this product of classroom creativity. Personally, I think it's marvellous and unique. And who wouldn't want a teacher like Nancy Dupree?",

      "bodyText": "The City broker Tullett Prebon plans to cut another 80 jobs against the backdrop of a \"challenging market\" and rising staff costs. The broker announced 80 job cuts two months ago and said on Tuesday it expected to axe as many again, mainly in back-office roles. The cuts will be spread across Europe, Asia and America. \"Actions have been taken to reduce costs and to maintain flexibility in the cost base, although the business does face increased costs relating to electronic platform developments and impending regulatory changes,\" the chief executive, Terry Smith, told Reuters. Reporting flat revenues for 2011 and a drop in profits, the firm highlighted cost pressures from broker pay. It said the rising pay costs reflected \"the highly competitive market for brokers and the significant investment that has been made in rebuilding the business in the Americas\". Tullett's shares were down almost 3% at 320.3p in mid-session trading after it reported revenues of \u00a3910.2m, compared with \u00a3908.5m in 2010. Underlying profit before tax was \u00a3136.1m, down from \u00a3149m in 2010. Smith noted a choppy outlook: \"Market and competitive conditions are expected to continue to be challenging. The world's financial markets remain unsettled, however, and it seems reasonable to expect that there will be some periods of market volatility and heightened activity during 2012, as well as periods of more subdued activity.\" Tullett's job cuts plan follows similar cost-cutting news last month from the rival broker Icap, which said in a trading update that it was reacting to the eurozone crisis and an uncertain global outlook. Commenting on Tullett's results, analysts at Singer Capital Markets said: \"This is a good result given the challenging markets faced during 2011 with overall market activity having been lower, reflecting continued investment in the business \u2026 The shares remain cheap and continue to trade on a sizeable discount to Icap despite delivering a substantially better return.\"",

      "bodyText": "At least they looked each other in the eye this time. But there was no escaping the sense that once again Israel's prime minister was playing schoolmaster to the US president's recalcitrant pupil. Binyamin Netanyahu arrived at the White House to pour forth the routine thanks for America's faithful support, although Barack Obama might have flinched at the Israeli leader's reference to Iran's view of the relationship: \"To them, you're the great Satan, we're the little Satan.\" But then Netanyahu got to the heart of the matter. He had looked a little tense, his hands firmly lodged on his splayed legs, as Obama welcomed him to the Oval office. There was still the chilliness that has characterised the relationship since they first met as leaders three years ago and the president mistakenly thought he could rail-road Netanyahu into halting the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank \u2013 a major obstacle to serious peace talks with the Palestinians. Last year, Netanyahu established who was really in charge when he humiliated Obama by lecturing him in public at the White House on the Holocaust and Israel's history. They could barely look at each other. This time though there's the threat of war to worry about, so they decided to try to make nice in public. Obama again assured Netanyahu that the Jewish state can rely on him. \"The United States will always have Israel's back,\" he said for the third time in recent days. Netanyahu thanked the president for his speech to the US's pro-Israel lobby group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), on Sunday. Obama had demanded an end to the \"loose talk of war\" and \"bluster\" against Iran \u2013 a clear reference to the noise out of Netanyahu's government. He called for time for sanctions to dissuade Tehran from pursuing a nuclear bomb, if that's what it's doing. Netanyahu ignored all that. The bit he honed in on was Obama's statement that Israel has the right to decide what is best for its own security. The tone in the Oval office changed. Netanyahu put on his grave voice. The teacher focused on the disruptive schoolboy who looked on without giving away he'd heard this all many times before. \"Israel must have the ability, always, to defend itself, by itself against any threat,\" he said. \"When it comes to Israel's security, Israel has the sovereign right to make its own decisions.\" So it was perfectly clear then. Netanyahu would like the world to think he is ready to bomb Iran. Obama would like the world to think he's opposed to the idea. Between those two positions the leaders of that other special relationship \u2013 the real one \u2013 appear to have reached an accommodation: Israel will attack Iran if it must but it should stop talking about it. Whether it will come to that is a matter of speculation as intense as Iran's alleged effort to build a nuclear bomb. Certainly there's opposition in America. The Israelis arrived to be confronted by a full-page advert in the Washington Post placed by retired US generals and intelligence officers declaring Mr President: Say No to War of Choice with Iran. Much of the public appears to agree. A Pew Research poll on Monday said 51% of Americans want the US to stay neutral if Israel attacks Iran. Yet it was clear from the encounter that Netanyahu has already scored a major victory. Where once meetings of the two were dominated by talk about the Palestinians, this time there was but the briefest of mentions by Obama and none by Netanyahu. Three years ago, Obama was promising to shift the weight of US power to drive Israel towards a deal with the Palestinians whether it really wants one or not. But the president of hope has been confronted with the prime minister of doom. Netanyahu sees only threats. The Arab Spring is a menace \u2014 more like an Arab Winter. Hamas is seeping into the Palestinian power structure. And now there's Iran. Israel's threat of another war has at least saved Netanyahu from having to talk to Obama about his least favourite subject; the future of a people who have yet to be given the right to make their own decisions.",

      "bodyText": "Civil servants have responded with dismay to a suggestion by cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood that policy-making could be outsourced. Heywood made the suggestion on Monday at an event hosted by the Institute for Government, to consider Whitehall reform. He said he recognised that the civil service has a monopoly on policy-making and that if other parts of the public sector were to be market-tested, policy, too, should be open to contestability. Heywood said the idea of asking for bids from potential policy advisors on specific areas hadn't yet been taken further, but was a \"perfectly legitimate challenge\". One former civil servant commented that the idea of outsourcing policy advice functions to the private and third sector \"did not go down well on my side of town\", arguing that while opening up policy-making processes to more than just an internal group of civil servants is a good thing, because it increases transparency and enables people to see the evidence for specific policies, outsourcing policy-making could result in conflicts of interest, a loss of corporate memory within the civil service, and the creation of a \"two-tier\" civil service, where those working for outsourced policy teams would lack the terms, conditions and protection of civil servants. \"My message to Sir Jeremy and to Sir Bob? Open-source: Yes. Outsource: No.\" Dr Dave O'Brien, who lectures on public policy at City University, described the idea as \"genuinely preposterous\". The suggestion from Heywood comes at a time when the government is keen to emphasise that it is considering radical ideas, following the departure from Downing Street of policy strategist Steve Hilton. On Tuesday, the prime minister David Cameron will give evidence to the Commons liaison committee on public service reform. The institute's proposals were set out by its new director, Peter Riddell, in an \"open letter\" to Heywood and to Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service. Riddell argues that without urgent reform, there is a risk of a \"downward spiral of cuts, inadequate services and a demoralised civil service\". In response to questions about whether Whitehall reform would be centrally driven, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said it would be centrally supported, but there would be no \"dramatic new model\" for how British civil servants work. \"There are clear pressing challenges and we need to change,\" he said. \"But this is not about turning everything upside down. We are building on tremendous strengths.\" This article is published by Guardian Professional.

      "body": "<p>Civil servants have responded with dismay to a suggestion by cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood that policy-making could be outsourced.</p> <p>Heywood made the suggestion on Monday at an event hosted by the Institute for Government, to consider Whitehall reform. He said he recognised that the civil service has a monopoly on policy-making and that if other parts of the public sector were to be market-tested, policy, too, should be open to contestability. Heywood said the idea of asking for bids from potential policy advisors on specific areas hadn't yet been taken further, but was a \"perfectly legitimate challenge\".</p> <p>One former civil servant <a href=\"http://adragonsbestfriend.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/open-sourcing-vs-outsourcing/\" title=\"\">commented</a> that the idea of outsourcing policy advice functions to the private and third sector \"did not go down well on my side of town\", arguing that while opening up policy-making processes to more than just an internal group of civil servants is a good thing, because it increases transparency and enables people to see the evidence for specific policies, outsourcing policy-making could result in conflicts of interest, a loss of corporate memory within the civil service, and the creation of a \"two-tier\" civil service, where those working for outsourced policy teams would lack the terms, conditions and protection of civil servants. \"My message to Sir Jeremy and to Sir Bob? Open-source: Yes. Outsource: No.\"</p> <p>Dr Dave O'Brien, who lectures on public policy at City University, described the idea as \"genuinely preposterous\".</p> <p>The suggestion from Heywood comes at a time when the government is keen to emphasise that it is considering radical ideas, following the departure from Downing Street of policy strategist Steve Hilton. On Tuesday, the prime minister David Cameron will give evidence to the Commons liaison committee on public service reform.</p> <p>The institute's proposals were set out by its new director, Peter Riddell, in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/mar/05/whitehall-reform-unprecedented-future\" title=\"\">\"open letter\"</a> to Heywood and to Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service. Riddell argues that without urgent reform, there is a risk of a \"downward spiral of cuts, inadequate services and a demoralised civil service\".</p> <p>In response to questions about whether Whitehall reform would be centrally driven, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said it would be centrally supported, but there would be no \"dramatic new model\" for how British civil servants work. \"There are clear pressing challenges and we need to change,\" he said. \"But this is not about turning everything upside down. We are building on tremendous strengths.\"</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

I also wondered whether I should be reading this book at all; as if by doing so I had sneaked into the ladies' loo, hidden inside a cubicle and overheard a conversation that was not meant for me. Chapter headings: \"I Start Bleeding!\" \"I Become Furry!\" \"I Need a Bra!\" \"I Encounter Some Sexism!\", and so on. These are not my things, although I once encountered some sexism when a woman left me and a male friend with the words: \"I'll let you get on with talking about tits or whatever it is you talk about when we're not around.\" I'm still a bit cross about that, actually, for like all male Guardian readers, I like to think of myself as someone entirely sympathetic to the whole feminist project, as long as it doesn't involve too much shouting at men. Or what happens when you leave the politics out of it, creating what Jenny Turner described as \"a weird sinkhole that quickly filled up with the most dreadful rubbish: wise wounds, herstory, nature goddesses, raped and defiled; sisters under the skin, flayed and joined, like the Human Centipede, in a single biomass; the fractal spread of male sexual violence, men fuck women replicated at every level of interaction, as through a stick of rock.\" Anyway, I sat down and started reading How to Be a Woman properly, and by the time Moran says \"in many ways, there is no crueller or more inappropriate present to give a child than oestrogen and a big pair of tits. Had anyone asked me ... I think I would have requested a book token or maybe a voucher for C&amp;A instead\", I realised I was in the company of someone who was going to keep me amused and that, frankly, is the bottom line. \"I'm neither 'pro-women' nor 'anti-men'. I'm just 'Thumbs up for the six billion.'\" I had never come across Caitlin Moran before: she writes for the Times, which perhaps accounts for the lack of politics in the book. This absence is very much a dog not barking in the night; I wonder whether it was a deliberate decision not to alienate her readership, or genuine indifference. Not that there is any dreadful rubbish in here: it is, quite simply, a book that might as well have been subtitled \"common sense, with some very good jokes\". It is as a comic writer that Moran particularly excels; by which I mean that the jokes aren't gags sprinkled around to make up for the surrounding pieties, they are integral to the whole project. Her account of the birth of her first child is absolutely mind-boggling and nerve-racking (and, while we're on present participles, breathtaking, in terms of the quality of prose used to describe the pain); and her very lovely-sounding husband's agony at her suffering is beautifully and memorably described. But then she can still squeeze in a good joke on how the whole experience has given her perspective: \"I doubt that I will get angry about Norwich Union changing its name to 'Aviva' ever again.'\" (There are no jokes in the chapter on abortion, though; but it is still level-headed and honest.) I presume that every woman who can read anything more challenging than Heat magazine has bought this book; good. Those who do read Heat and little else should also read it: it's healthier, and Moran's description of Katie Price's nasty self-absorption strips all the cant away from assertions that she is, somehow, a feminist icon. But pointing at folly and laughing at it, whether it is spending \u00a321,000 on a wedding or having your expressions Botoxed away from your face, is a superb technique. The clever bit will be to get men to read it, too, so that they can finally answer the question that bothered Freud so: \"What do women want?\" To which the answer would apparently be: \"Pretty much the same as everyone.\"",

      "bodyText": "\"Can I get my Street Fighter without sexual harassment?\" asked Twitch.tv community manager Jared Rae of moderately well-known Tekken player Aris Bakhtanians during a conversation about sexist language at pro fighting-game tournaments. \"You can't. You can't because they're one and the same thing,\" he answered. \"This is a community that's, you know, 15 or 20 years old, and the sexual harassment is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community.\" Unfortunately for Bakhtanians, these comments were streamed live on video as part of Capcom's Cross Assault reality series, which pits a team of Street Fighter players and a team of Tekken players against each other in a tournament for significant prize money. You can read a full rundown of the conversation and the ensuing large-scale controversy over at Giant Bomb. It's a very ugly scene. Female contestant Miranda Pakozdi ended up essentially withdrawing from the tournament, losing matches deliberately to escape Bakhtanians' jibes. He's since apologised, explaining that his remarks were made in anger, but that doesn't help much. Sexual harassment is not part of the culture, obviously. I've been a part of the gaming community for going on 20 years now, and I don't think that sexism is a part of gaming culture any more than racism is a part of British culture. It exists, sure, but it's not mainstream. It's not accepted. But two things have happened in the past few weeks that have brought this issue \u2013 one that I'm usually happy to quietly ignore \u2013 into uncomfortably sharp relief, and made me question how we approach these incidents when they arise. Just a few weeks ago, BioWare writer Jennifer Hepler ended up deleting her Twitter account to escape the hatred and abuse of gamers calling her an \"obese cunt\", a \"fat bitch\", a \"whore\", a \"plague\" and a \"cancer\", advising her to commit suicide and making harassing phone calls to her home. (Until recently, a quick Twitter search showed the full extent of this extraordinary harassment; since the closure of her account, it seems that it is no longer archived, which is good if you don't want your day ruined by reading it). She was singled out by extremely angry people unhappy with, among other things, BioWare's inclusion of optional gay romances in Dragon Age II, the way that the developer's games are becoming more accessible, and perceived shortcomings in plot and characterisation in more recent BioWare titles that Hepler had worked on (or hadn't even worked on, in many cases). Why was all this laid at Hepler's feet? Because she said, in an interview from 2006, that she sometimes didn't enjoy playing through the combat sections in games all that much, that story was more important to her, and that being able to skip combat would make games more enjoyable for some people. These responses, in heavily-edited form, were originally posted on Reddit and later on the BioWare forums. (The full original interview can't be found anywhere online anymore, so all we're left with is these out-of-context quotes.) It's difficult to imagine the language used towards Hepler being as loaded and incendiary if she were a man. Why she, and not any of the other writers at BioWare, has been held solely responsible by a small group of astonishingly entitled and, evidently, astonishingly misogynistic people for ruining \"their\" games is largely a mystery; we can only assume that it was because she was a visible target for their hitherto directionless rage, and her gender made her an easy one. It's a universal truth of the internet, from YouTube to political comments threads, that awful people feel more comfortable hurling abuse at you if you're female, gay or part of a racial minority. She also dared to stand up for herself before closing her account, which only angered them further. Neither of these recent events reflects at all well on the gaming community. The thought that someone on the outside might think that this is what we're like \u2013 a bunch of pointlessly furious, venomous, entitled arseholes that consider ourselves outwith the normal rules and boundaries of respect for our fellow human beings \u2013 makes me extremely sad. It paints a picture of the gaming community that I don't want to believe in, and that goes against the vast majority of my experiences. This is not what we're like. There is abundant proof of this. All you have to do is look at the wider response to either the Hepler or the Cross Assault controversy to see the small minority of hateful commentators drowned out by a vocal majority of people expressing outrage, disappointment and sympathy. BioWare has vocally stood by Hepler, making a donation to Bullying Canada in her name. Capcom has distanced itself from Bakhtanians' comments and apologised that they were broadcast. Of course, both of these events have also brought the worst kind of person out of the woodwork and into the comments threads, too \u2013 much as almost any conversation about sexism, racism, homophobia or politics on the internet seems to attract the trolls like a giant unpleasantness magnet \u2013 but the bigger picture is a community of people united by common decency as well as a shared love for video games. The difficult thing about the issue of sexism in the games industry, for me, is that even talking about it is giving it more attention than these idiots deserve. Often it only fuels the fire, and it attracts the haters your way, which is something that any sane person would want to avoid. It's impossible not to want to speak out against the people who give us a bad name and feed negative stereotypes, but the fear is that in doing so, you'll both bring negative attention upon yourself and tarnish the gaming community as a whole. But keeping quiet isn't an option either; we need to stand up for ourselves. I've had abuse directed at me plenty of times by strangers online, a lot of it to do with my gender, but the idiots are always vastly outnumbered by intelligent and respectful people who are interested in actual discussion rather than insults and pointless cruelty. This is the gaming community, for me \u2013 the great people I've chatted, argued and played with online, the guys and girls I grew up playing split-screen multiplayer with, the readers who start thought-provoking discussions, the creative and interesting folks I work with every day in this industry. Not the twerps who call me names in comments threads. Are things like the Hepler and Cross Assault situations acceptable? No. Should we quietly ignore incidences of sexism in the gaming community in the hope that it might go away on its own? No. But is this a part of gaming culture? Absolutely not. We are not like that. It's important that we make our voices heard, too. \u2022 Keza MacDonald is UK Games Editor at IGN.com. You can follow her on Twitter @kezamacdonald.",

      "body": "<p>\"Can I get my Street Fighter without sexual harassment?\" asked Twitch.tv community manager Jared Rae of moderately well-known Tekken player Aris Bakhtanians during a conversation about sexist language at pro fighting-game tournaments. \"You can't. You can't because they're one and the same thing,\" he answered. \"This is a community that's, you know, 15 or 20 years old, and the sexual harassment is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately for Bakhtanians, these comments were streamed live on video as part of Capcom's Cross Assault reality series, which pits a team of Street Fighter players and a team of Tekken players against each other in a tournament for significant prize money. You can read a full rundown of the conversation and the ensuing large-scale controversy <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/news/when-passions-flare-lines-are-crossed-updated/4006/\" title=\"\">over at Giant Bomb</a>. It's a very ugly scene. Female contestant Miranda Pakozdi ended up essentially withdrawing from the tournament, losing matches deliberately to escape Bakhtanians' jibes. <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/news/aris-aris-bakhtanians-releases-statement-on-recent-comments/4007/\" title=\"\">He's since apologised</a>, explaining that his remarks were made in anger, but that doesn't help much.</p> <p>Sexual harassment is not part of the culture, obviously. I've been a part of the gaming community for going on 20 years now, and I don't think that sexism is a part of gaming culture any more than racism is a part of British culture. It exists, sure, but it's not mainstream. It's not accepted. But two things have happened in the past few weeks that have brought this issue \u2013 one that I'm usually happy to quietly ignore \u2013 into uncomfortably sharp relief, and made me question how we approach these incidents when they arise.</p> <p>Just a few weeks ago, BioWare writer Jennifer Hepler ended up deleting her Twitter account to escape the hatred and abuse of gamers calling her an \"obese cunt\", a \"fat bitch\", a \"whore\", a \"plague\" and a \"cancer\", advising her to commit suicide and making harassing phone calls to her home. (Until recently, a quick Twitter search showed the full extent of this extraordinary harassment; since the closure of her account, it seems that it is no longer archived, which is good if you don't want your day ruined by reading it).</p> <p>She was singled out by extremely angry people unhappy with, among other things, BioWare's inclusion of optional gay romances in Dragon Age II, the way that the developer's games are becoming more accessible, and perceived shortcomings in plot and characterisation in more recent BioWare titles that Hepler had worked on (or hadn't even worked on, in many cases).</p> <p>Why was all this laid at Hepler's feet? Because she said, in an interview from 2006, that she sometimes didn't enjoy playing through the combat sections in games all that much, that story was more important to her, and that being able to skip combat would make games more enjoyable for some people. These responses, in heavily-edited form, <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/pp3lb/this_women_is_the_cancer_that_is_killing_bioware/\" title=\"\">were originally posted on Reddit</a> and later <a href=\"http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/141/index/6661321/1\" title=\"\">on the BioWare forums</a>. (The full original interview can't be found anywhere online anymore, so all we're left with is these out-of-context quotes.)</p> <p>It's difficult to imagine the language used towards Hepler being as loaded and incendiary if she were a man. Why she, and not any of the other writers at BioWare, has been held solely responsible by a small group of astonishingly entitled and, evidently, astonishingly misogynistic people for ruining \"their\" games is largely a mystery; we can only assume that it was because she was a visible target for their hitherto directionless rage, and her gender made her an easy one.</p> <p>It's a universal truth of the internet, from YouTube to political comments threads, that awful people feel more comfortable hurling abuse at you if you're female, gay or part of a racial minority. She also dared to stand up for herself before closing her account, which only angered them further.</p> <p>Neither of these recent events reflects at all well on the gaming community. The thought that someone on the outside might think that this is what we're like \u2013 a bunch of pointlessly furious, venomous, entitled arseholes that consider ourselves outwith the normal rules and boundaries of respect for our fellow human beings \u2013 makes me extremely sad. It paints a picture of the gaming community that I don't want to believe in, and that goes against the vast majority of my experiences. This is not what we're like.</p> <p>There is abundant proof of this. All you have to do is look at the wider response to either the Hepler or the Cross Assault controversy to see the small minority of hateful commentators drowned out by a vocal majority of people expressing outrage, disappointment and sympathy. BioWare <a href=\"http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/260/index/9381043/1\" title=\"\">has vocally stood by Hepler</a>, making a donation to Bullying Canada in her name. Capcom has distanced itself from Bakhtanians' comments and apologised that they were broadcast.</p> <p>Of course, both of these events have also brought the worst kind of person out of the woodwork and into the comments threads, too \u2013 much as almost any conversation about sexism, racism, homophobia or politics on the internet seems to attract the trolls like a giant unpleasantness magnet \u2013 but the bigger picture is a community of people united by common decency as well as a shared love for video games.</p> <p>The difficult thing about the issue of sexism in the games industry, for me, is that even talking about it is giving it more attention than these idiots deserve. Often it only fuels the fire, and it attracts the haters your way, which is something that any sane person would want to avoid. It's impossible not to want to speak out against the people who give us a bad name and feed negative stereotypes, but the fear is that in doing so, you'll both bring negative attention upon yourself and tarnish the gaming community as a whole. But keeping quiet isn't an option either; we need to stand up for ourselves.</p> <p>I've had abuse directed at me plenty of times by strangers online, a lot of it to do with my gender, but the idiots are always vastly outnumbered by intelligent and respectful people who are interested in actual discussion rather than insults and pointless cruelty. This is the gaming community, for me \u2013 the great people I've chatted, argued and played with online, the guys and girls I grew up playing split-screen multiplayer with, the readers who start thought-provoking discussions, the creative and interesting folks I work with every day in this industry. Not the twerps who call me names in comments threads.</p> <p>Are things like the Hepler and Cross Assault situations acceptable? No. Should we quietly ignore incidences of sexism in the gaming community in the hope that it might go away on its own? No. But is this a part of gaming culture? Absolutely not. We are not like that. It's important that we make our voices heard, too.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Keza MacDonald is UK Games Editor at </strong><a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>IGN.com</strong></a><strong>.

Older and disabled people, their families and carers are today gathering at Westminster to highlight the issue of funding care \u2013 and what's being billed as the world's first \"twobby\" (that's a Twitter lobby) is taking place simultaneously online, read more via the hashtag #twobby. This post on the Care Lobby 2012 site explains how people can get involved online. On his Social Care Insight blog, Tony Butcher explains why he's supporting the campaign: If we want to provide the best possible quality of care for the most vulnerable in society then we need the best possible workers to provide that care and support. Yet care workers have been described as 'vulnerable workers' by the TUC and there seems to be little political action on improving the image of care work to encourage more people into the sector. And the issue of social care will only become more pressing over time, more people will need care and support services as the population continues to live longer and WE WILL NEED more workers to provide that support. Government should be about leadership yet ALL political parties seem to prefer to run and hide when it comes to dealing with social care. And on the Joseph Rowntree Foundation blog, Emma Stone adds: Adult social care is a long-neglected and poorly-understood issue. It affects many of us now personally, through our family and friends, and through work. It will affect most of us at some point. This is about all of us \u2013 it's not just about 'them' older people or disabled people. There have now been several government commissions, consultations, papers, reports and expressions of intent around social care. ... Frustration is mounting as people in the care sector \u2013 especially people who use and give care and support \u2013 see the prospect of real reform receding. Cross-party talks are under way and those involved need to know just how important social care is to us all. That is why the Care and Support Alliance is organising today's lobby and asking MPs across all parties to end the care crisis, and to act now to reform the care system in England. \u2022 NHS reforms. It's a busy day on the NHS reforms live blog, as Claire Phipps covers the day's developments - including the return of the health and social care bill to the House of Lords, where peers will discuss two new amendments tabled by the health minister Earl Howe yesterday; plus the second day of the information tribunal hearing the appeal against the information commissioner's ruling that the Department of Health must publish its risk registers on the reforms. And find out what happened when the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, made a visit to the Royal Free hospital in north London yesterday. As Phipps puts it \"clue: it didn't go very well for him\". \u2022 An interesting post by the Resolution Foundation's Gavin Kelly on the New Statesman blog on the background to the child benefit saga. He asks, Do you prioritise fairness for individuals or for households?, and adds: The Child Benefit proposal is an uncomfortable hybrid: it's based on individual earnings (means testing child benefit for higher rate tax-payers) but in a very clunky and arbitrary way it nods towards considering household income in that it asks each claimant whether their partner pays the higher rate of tax. The result, as has been widely pointed out, is that the single-earner household on \u00a345k risks losing up to several thousand pounds while the dual-earning household on a combined income of \u00a380k loses nothing. At the heart of the issue is the point that tax and benefit reforms can prioritise fairness for individuals (Clegg's argument), or they can seek to respect the principle of individual taxation whilst advancing greater equity for low and modest income households with children - which is in essence what tax credits seek to achieve (at the price of far greater complexity). But they can't do both at once. On his Social Policy blog, Professor Paul Spicker writes: The main argument for cutting Child Benefit seems to be that it will help to cut the deficit. If the government wanted to increase the burden on richer families, it has the option of clawing back the benefit through the tax system. It would make more sense to tax all higher rate payers, rather than only those with children. If the government was serious about cutting the deficit, they would be raising tax. The fact they are not talking about raising tax is a strong indication that this is not really about balancing the books. They are focusing on public spending, which is quite a different issue. \u2022 A gold star for Hounslow council's use of social media, as reported by the Snipe London blog. When asked on Twitter: How do we arrange for lovely Chiswick to be removed from your skanky borough? The borough replied: we've no plans to remove Chiswick from lovely Hounslow. We'd be interested to know what particularly you find 'skanky'.

      "bodyText": "Every minute of every day, one woman dies somewhere in the world due to preventable complications in pregnancy or childbirth. That's a total of 1,000 women dying each day, or 365,000 dead each year, from pregnancy-related causes. Despite research that shows an overall decrease in worldwide maternal mortality since 1980, millions of women and girls still face a staggering risk of death or disability during pregnancy and childbirth. The World Bank boasts that it has positioned itself as a \"global leader\" in reproductive health, especially for youth and the poor, having committed $96m to reproductive health projects in 2011. However, the bank fails to mention that this total represents just 0.2% of its $43bn budget for the financial year ending 2011. The bank also overlooks the fact that almost half of its reproductive health projects in Sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 where women have a one in 16 chance of dying during pregnancy or childbirth \u2014 are funded by loans. These loans leave poor countries indebted and threaten to divert domestic spending away from vital public health services. Such spending cuts are devastating for poor women, who not only suffer directly from reduced access to healthcare but are responsible for the health of their households. There is a striking mismatch between countries' maternal mortality rates and the bank's spending on reproductive health. While Sierra Leone (where women face a one in 21 risk of dying in pregnancy and childbirth over their lifetime) receives the greatest amount of reproductive health funding per person at $7.43, Rwanda (where the risk of dying is one in 35) receives just $0.38 per person. Women in Niger, Liberia and Somalia face an average lifetime one in 17 risk of maternal death, yet these countries receive no reproductive health funding from the bank at all. While the World Bank's approach to reducing maternal mortality responds to many leading causes of maternal death, such as haemorrhage, infection and obstructed labour, its investments virtually ignore the risk of maternal injury and death that stem from unsafe abortion. Globally, unsafe abortions account for 67,900 (13%) maternal deaths each year; approximately half occur in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the bank's Reproductive Health Action Plan acknowledges the severe risk of maternal death and injury due to unsafe abortion, particularly for adolescents, the majority of bank-funded reproductive health projects do not include any interventions to address it. For example, the bank's Health System Performance projectin the west African country of Benin, which allocates about $5m to reproductive health, acknowledges that infections stemming from unsafe abortion are the second leading cause of maternal death at four of Benin's referral hospitals. However, none of the project activities directly addresses this alarming statistic. Although four of the bank's 39 current reproductive health-related projects in sub-Saharan Africa include interventions to reduce maternal death from unsafe abortions, none include indicators to measure if these interventions are actually carried out. Also troubling is the fact that many of the World Bank's current reproductive health projects promote healthcare user fees, despite overwhelming evidence that such fees drastically reduce women's healthcare access, exacerbate poverty and undermine efforts to reduce maternal mortality. For example, the World Bank's $4.3m reproductive health vouchers in western Uganda project, which ended in December 2011, required women to purchase $2 vouchers that entitled them to prenatal and postnatal care, treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and facility-based delivery. This is a prohibitive amount in Uganda, where half the population lives on less than $2 per day. The World Bank must re-evaluate its strategies for reducing maternal mortality if it is ever going to live up to its claim of being a \"global leader\" in improving reproductive health. The bank must increase the number of grants it provides to expand access to reproductive and maternal healthcare \u2014 including post-abortion care \u2014 and eliminate any fees attached to these vital services.",

      "bodyText": "2pm Lunchtime update There would appear to be confidence about the chances of the David Pipe-trained Glassawine (3.00), now 11-4 from 6-1 for the handicap hurdle at Exeter. The grey is making his handicap debut after an absence of 82 days. Newcastle's three-mile novice handicap chase is going to be a competitive affair, judging by the market moves. Night In Milan (3.20) is 3-1 from 4s while an even more dramatic move has come for Harris Hawk from John Wade's yard, who was going to be the rank outsider but is now 5s from 14-1. He made three notable mistakes when beaten 42 lengths on his chasing debut last time. 1.20pm Grumeti lame but expected to make Triumph More bad news for someone. Grumeti, the 5-1 favourite for the Triumph Hurdle, is lame this morning but his trainer, Alan King, hopes this should have no great bearing on his chance in the race next Friday. \"Last night Grumeti spread his right fore shoe,\" King has said on his website, \"and the toeclip has gone into the foot, which left him lame and quite sore this morning. We certainly would not have wanted this to happen next Tuesday, but the Triumph is still 10 days away and I would hope that he would be sound again in 48 hours and able to exercise again at the weekend.\" 12.15pm Kauto Star - change of plan! Paul Nicholls has just reported through his Betfair column that he has changed his mind about plans for Kauto Star and will now give him a gallop after racing at Wincanton on Friday. This, it seems, will replace the planned gallop on Saturday morning, which was to have been the decisive factor on the question of whether the horse will be allowed to run in next week's Cheltenham Gold Cup. \"I thought it a better idea to give him a spin, and a good workout, on the grass away from home,\" Nicholls said. \"Ruby [Walsh] will ride and he will work with Mon Parrain. \"If he does come through that OK, we will look to school him on Monday morning. But I must stress that it is one step at a time and it is important that people don't get carried away. We aren't, just yet. But we are heading in the right direction quickly, it seems.\" Nicholls said that Kauto Star's exercise was stepped up again this morning. He did two canters up the famous Ditcheat hill with Ulck Du Lin, being aimed at the Fred Winter. \"He came through it fine and I'm happy with him at the moment,\" the trainer said. Kauto Star is recovering from injuries sustained in a schooling fall on the Friday before last. He is currently trading at around 5-1 for the Gold Cup. Cheltenham Festival stat of the day, by Paul Jones Irish-trained horses have a terrific record in some of the handicaps at the Festival, notably the Coral Cup with 7 wins since it was first run in 1993 and also the Vincent O'Brien County Hurdle (5 of the last 9 winners) but they have a wretched record in others. Two races in which to be very careful about backing an Irish-trained horse are the Byrne Group Plate and the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Handicap Chase. Remarkably, there has been only one Irish-trained winner of the Plate since 1951 (in 1982) and no winners of the Kim Muir since Greasepaint 29 years ago. Paul Jones is author of the Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Guide Today's best bets, by Chris Cook Another week, another National. I'm sure you've all spent recent weeks looking forward to the Devon National, which is run at Exeter today. Nigel Twiston-Davies probably has because it is the sort of race when his Ammunition (3.30) can get his ideal conditions, a real test of stamina on decent ground against moderate rivals. Now 12, he won this race last year and gets to run today from the same handicap mark because of some subsequent defeats. But this would be easily his best chance since this race 12 months ago and he ran with credit when second here last time on going that was probably on the soft side for him. He's 9-2. I'm surprised you can get 6-1 about Bounds And Leaps (4.00) for the novice chase, considering she seemed to improve so much for being switched to fences in the autumn. She hacked up in an alleged handicap at Chepstow in October and was tanking along in front at Ascot the next month when falling, her first mistake. I think we're getting a bigger price than we should about her because punters are nervous of novices with 'F' next to their name, but, as Nick Mordin used to say, mistakes by novice chasers are only worrying when they show signs of failing to learn from them. The closing handicap hurdle for conditional riders is a tricky-looking heat, which is why we've included it in the competition. My pick, Hearty Royale (5.00), needs to improve for the switch to handicapping but has the look of a horse who can do that and the Colin Tizzard yard continues in good form. The 7-1 is fair enough, though I'd stop short of calling it tempting. Newcastle's card goes ahead, the course having thawed out after overnight frosts. The going is good to soft, with good places and soft places, but it wouldn't surprise me if it rode a bit more testing than that suggests. That would suit Dice (3.50), whose first hurdles win was here on soft ground in January. He's only 4lb higher, should still be competitive but is available at 9-1. Tipping competition, day two More than 30 of you are off the mark, thanks to a day one with three winners at 5-1 or shorter. On the other hand, even the backmarkers remain just a 9-1 winner from the top. Kenty58 and fatdeano bounced out to an early lead with Acapulco Bay (5-1) and Carrick Boy (3-1). Factormax had Carrick Bay and Quixote (4-1). Today, we'd like your tips, please, for these races: 3.30 Exeter, 3.50 Newcastle, 5.00 Exeter.

      "body": "<h2>2pm Lunchtime update</h2> <p>There would appear to be confidence about the chances of the David Pipe-trained <em>Glassawine (3.00)</em>, now 11-4 from 6-1 for the handicap hurdle at Exeter. The grey is making his handicap debut after an absence of 82 days.</p> <p>Newcastle's three-mile novice handicap chase is going to be a competitive affair, judging by the market moves. <em>Night In Milan (3.20)</em> is 3-1 from 4s while an even more dramatic move has come for <em>Harris Hawk</em> from John Wade's yard, who was going to be the rank outsider but is now 5s from 14-1. He made three notable mistakes when beaten 42 lengths on his chasing debut last time.</p> <h2>1.20pm Grumeti lame but expected to make Triumph</h2> <p>More bad news for someone. Grumeti, the 5-1 favourite for the Triumph Hurdle, is lame this morning but his trainer, Alan King, hopes this should have no great bearing on his chance in the race next Friday.</p> <p>\"Last night Grumeti spread his right fore shoe,\" <a href=\"http://alankingracing.co.uk/news/news1.php\">King has said on his website</a>, \"and the toeclip has gone into the foot, which left him lame and quite sore this morning. We certainly would not have wanted this to happen next Tuesday, but the Triumph is still 10 days away and I would hope that he would be sound again in 48 hours and able to exercise again at the weekend.\" </p> <h2>12.15pm Kauto Star - change of plan!</h2> <p>Paul Nicholls has just reported <a href=\"http://betting.betfair.com/horse-racing/paul-nicholls/latest-news/paul-nicholls-kauto-star-will-gallop-at-wincanton-this-060312.html\">through his Betfair column</a> that he has changed his mind about plans for Kauto Star and will now give him a gallop after racing at Wincanton on Friday. This, it seems, will replace the planned gallop on Saturday morning, which was to have been the decisive factor on the question of whether the horse will be allowed to run in next week's Cheltenham Gold Cup.</p> <p>\"I thought it a better idea to give him a spin, and a good workout, on the grass away from home,\" Nicholls said. \"Ruby [Walsh] will ride and he will work with Mon Parrain.</p> <p>\"If he does come through that OK, we will look to school him on Monday morning. But I must stress that it is one step at a time and it is important that people don't get carried away. We aren't, just yet. But we are heading in the right direction quickly, it seems.\"</p> <p>Nicholls said that Kauto Star's exercise was stepped up again this morning. He did two canters up the famous Ditcheat hill with Ulck Du Lin, being aimed at the Fred Winter. \"He came through it fine and I'm happy with him at the moment,\" the trainer said.</p> <p>Kauto Star is recovering from injuries sustained in a schooling fall on the Friday before last. He is currently trading at around 5-1 for the Gold Cup.</p> <h2>Cheltenham Festival stat of the day, by Paul Jones<br></h2> <p>Irish-trained horses have a terrific record in some of the handicaps at the Festival, notably the Coral Cup with 7 wins since it was first run in 1993 and also the Vincent O'Brien County Hurdle (5 of the last 9 winners) but they have a wretched record in others. Two races in which to be very careful about backing an Irish-trained horse are the Byrne Group Plate and the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Handicap Chase. Remarkably, there has been only one Irish-trained winner of the Plate since 1951 (in 1982) and no winners of the Kim Muir since Greasepaint 29 years ago.</p> <p><em>Paul Jones is author of the </em><a href=\"http://www.weatherbysshop.co.uk/books/betting/cheltenham-festival-betting-guide-2012\" title=\"Weatherbys\"><em>Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Guide</em></a><em> </em></p> <h2>Today's best bets, by Chris Cook<br></h2> <p>Another week, another National. I'm sure you've all spent recent weeks looking forward to the Devon National, which is run at Exeter today.

Sacha Baron Cohen famously played the role in Tim Burton's 2007 film adaptation starring Johnny Depp. Manford will replace Robert Burt, who transfers with the rest of Jonathan Kent's original cast, but is scheduled to appear in The Fairy Queen at Glyndebourne, also directed by Kent, over the summer.

In 2010, he resigned as co-host of the One Show after only four months following revelations about his inappropriate use of Twitter. Kent's production, which stars Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton as Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett respectively, received widespread critical acclaim when it premiered last year and was named best regional production at the Whatsonstage.com awards last month.",

      "bodyText": "There are signs, like green shoots heralding spring, that the last taboo of British politics is breaking. Liberal Democrats are finally gearing themselves up seriously to question the Conservative attachment to Britain's Trident nuclear weapons system and commitment to replace it with a \"like for like\" fleet of ballistic missile submarines. Trident - the ultimate strategic weapon - was excluded from the coalition government's \"strategic defence and security review\" last autumn. And judging from the \"shadow defence review\" consultation paper, just launched, there is no difference at all between Labour and Conservatives on the matter. \"While nuclear weapons exist, we cannot leave ourselves and our children open to the threat of nuclear blackmail\", it states emphatically as if no more need be said. Labour, it adds, \"remains committed to the position set out in the 2006 white paper to replace the current Vanguard class submarines and Trident missile system\". Significantly, when the proposals in the white paper were put to a Commons vote early in 2007, the Blair government had to rely on the support of Conservative MPs. Labour says its review \"does not specifically consider the issue of Trident renewal\". However, it adds that \"Labour is committed to examining the findings of the government's 'Trident Alternatives Review'\". The review was part of the deal which set up the coalition government in May 2010. Whether the review, due to be completed later this year, but which the government says will not be published, turns out to be a mere sop to the LibDems remains to be seen. It will look at alternatives, notably placing nuclear warheads on cruise missiles. If David Cameron gets his way, it will reject them on the grounds that they would be almost as expensive as Trident, less reliable, and not an effective deterrent. How Labour, or any independent outsider, will be able to \"examine\" the findings of the review, given that it will not be published, is far from clear. Now, the thinktank CentreForum - independent but linked to the LibDems - says the plans to build a new Trident system are \"nonsensical\" and should be scrapped. As my colleague, Nick Hopkins, notes, the 60-page study, Dropping the Bomb: A Post-Trident Future, is believed to reflect the views of many senior Lib Dems who are trying to force a debate on whether the UK still needs a nuclear deterrent. The report says the government is sleepwalking into taking a costly and illogical decision at a time the army, navy, and air force are being squeezed by budget cuts. The cost of a new fleet of Trident submarines alone is officially estimated at \u00a325bn. Interestingly, the report's author, Toby Fenwick, is a former Treasury official. BAE Systems, manufacturer of the Trident subs, is listed on CentreForum's website, as one of the thinktank's \"corporate partners\". In his memoirs, A Journey, Tony Blair described Trident's expense as \"huge\" and its military use as a weapon \"non-existent\". He said he could see clearly the force of the \"common sense and practical argument\" against Trident. In the end, he wrote, he thought giving Trident up would be \"too big a downgrading of our status as a nation\". But not, perhaps, too big for those former admirals and generals worried about Britain's post-imperial status, who say that as a result of budget cuts, Britain will no longer be able to defend the Falkland Islands. The cuts have also meant that the navy will not be able regularly to deploy drug-busting frigates to the Caribbean, the army will not get the vehicles it has been asking for for decades, and families of the armed forces the decent housing they deserve. Senior officials say the defence budget cannot pay for the aircraft carriers planned for the navy as well as Trident. One of the projects will have to go. Unless, of course, David Cameron persuades his friend, George Osborne, that the Treasury should cough up and pay for Trident. In this way, the money will not come out of the defence budget, though of course it would still be funded by taxpayers.",

      "body": "<p>There are signs, like green shoots heralding spring, that the last taboo of British politics is breaking.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats are finally gearing themselves up seriously to question the Conservative attachment to Britain's Trident nuclear weapons system and commitment to replace it with a \"like for like\" fleet of ballistic missile submarines.</p> <p>Trident - the ultimate strategic weapon - was excluded from the coalition government's \"strategic defence and security review\" last autumn.<br>And judging from the \"shadow defence review\" consultation paper, just launched, there is no difference at all between Labour and Conservatives on the matter. </p> <p>\"While nuclear weapons exist, we cannot leave ourselves and our children open to the threat of nuclear blackmail\", it states emphatically as if no more need be said. Labour, it adds, \"remains committed to the position set out in the 2006 white paper to replace the current Vanguard class submarines and Trident missile system\". Significantly, when the proposals in the white paper were put to a Commons vote early in 2007, the Blair government had to rely on the support of Conservative MPs. </p> <p>Labour says its review \"does not specifically consider the issue of Trident renewal\". However, it adds that \"Labour is committed to examining the findings of the government's 'Trident Alternatives Review'\". The review was part of the deal which set up the coalition government in May 2010. Whether the review, due to be completed later this year, but which the government says will not be published, turns out to be a mere sop to the LibDems remains to be seen.</p> <p>It will look at alternatives, notably placing nuclear warheads on cruise missiles. If David Cameron gets his way, it will reject them on the grounds that they would be almost as expensive as Trident, less reliable, and not an effective deterrent. How Labour, or any independent outsider, will be able to \"examine\" the findings of the review, given that it will not be published, is far from clear.</p> <p>Now, the thinktank CentreForum - independent but linked to the LibDems - says the plans to build a new Trident system are \"nonsensical\" and should be scrapped. As my colleague, Nick Hopkins, notes, the 60-page study, Dropping the Bomb: A Post-Trident Future, is believed to reflect the views of many senior Lib Dems who are trying to force a debate on whether the UK still needs a nuclear deterrent.</p> <p>The report says the government is sleepwalking into taking a costly and illogical decision at a time the army, navy, and air force are being squeezed by budget cuts. The cost of a new fleet of Trident submarines alone is officially estimated at \u00a325bn. Interestingly, the report's author, Toby Fenwick, is a former Treasury official. BAE Systems, manufacturer of the Trident subs, is listed on CentreForum's website, as one of the thinktank's \"corporate partners\".</p> <p>In his memoirs, A Journey, Tony Blair described Trident's expense as \"huge\" and its military use as a weapon \"non-existent\". He said he could see clearly the force of the \"common sense and practical argument\" against Trident. In the end, he wrote, he thought giving Trident up would be \"too big a downgrading of our status as a nation\".</p> <p>But not, perhaps, too big for those former admirals and generals worried about Britain's post-imperial status, who say that as a result of budget cuts, Britain will no longer be able to defend the Falkland Islands. The cuts have also meant that the navy will not be able regularly to deploy drug-busting frigates to the Caribbean, the army will not get the vehicles it has been asking for for decades, and families of the armed forces the decent housing they deserve.</p> <p>Senior officials say the defence budget cannot pay for the aircraft carriers planned for the navy as well as Trident. One of the projects will have to go. Unless, of course, David Cameron persuades his friend, George Osborne, that the Treasury should cough up and pay for Trident. In this way, the money will not come out of the defence budget, though of course it would still be funded by taxpayers.</p>",

Hebburn is written by standup comic Jason Cook and is based on his experiences of growing up in the north-east of England. It will star newcomer Chris Ramsey as Jason, who leaves Tyneside for the bright lights of Manchester and secretly gets married without telling his family. Reeves will play his merchant sailor father Tony and Kimberley Nixon \u2013 one of the stars of Channel 4's Fresh Meat \u2013 his middle-class, Jewish wife. It will be Reeves's first sitcom for the BBC since Catterick, his project with long-time sidekick Bob Mortimer, which ran for one series in 2004. Cook will also star in the show as \"lovable rogue\" Ramsey, a character inspired by \u2013 and this is where it gets complicated \u2013 Chris Ramsey. Cook said: \"I somehow knew Chris would end up playing the young version of me and that I would be playing Ramsey and unbelievably, when I was younger my hair was even worse than Chris's is now.\" Produced by Channel X North and Baby Cow Manchester, it was one of six shows piloted last year as part of the BBC's Salford Sitcom Showcase season. The pilot was not for broadcast. The BBC's comedy commissioning executive editor Kristian Smith, who ordered the six-part series, said: \"Not only does it bring back the warm heart of the north-east to sitcom, but also delivers a charming and funny comedy about a grown-up family with a fantastic cast attached.\" Reeves returned to BBC2 with a revival of panel show Shooting Stars in 2009 but it was dropped by the channel last year.

Charity may have been rebranded as the \"third sector\" and the sad rattling of tins replaced by annual telethons and online appeals, but I have an ingrained, rather old-school leftie antipathy to a lot of fundraising. You may be familiar with the arguments: some of it, at least, serves to relieve the rich and powerful of their true responsibilities, and smooth over global and national inequalities: if you want a sharp sense of what I'm driving at, picture all those bunfights they report in Hello! magazine, where a rock star, some hedge-fund managers and a few minor royals party it up so as to throw a few pennies at the disadvantaged. That's the sensible, though undoubtedly pious bit: the more emotional side of me also has a deep dislike of red noses, fancy dress and the heinous crimes against taste and decorum wrought by student \"rag\" activities \u2013 most of which, when I was at college, seemed to be organised by the people who then followed through on their concern for the weak by going off to work for management consultants and defence contractors. Go figure, and all that. But anyway. The modern interface between \u2013 if I must \u2013 the third sector and the public has long been the so-called \"chugger\", or charity mugger: such a ubiquitous part of the modern townscape that I cannot honestly remember a time when they were not there. They always seem to me slightly pitiful figures, braving the cold during university vacations for what I assumed was a pittance. But perhaps not: in a piece put up on Monday by the Daily Telegraph, one ex-chugger described the economics of the job thus: \"I got \u00a37 an hour, plus \u00a330 for every sign-up you got after the eighth, which meant that the better fund-raisers were on a stupendously good wage.\" Now, after years of low-level moaning, there comes a remarkable backlash. In Burnley, Lancashire, chuggers are now only allowed to do their thing on Tuesdays and Thursdays, thanks to complaints from local traders that they were discouraging people from coming into the town. Now the altogether more sizable city of Gloucester wants to follow suit. In Leamington Spa, people are also up in arms. Ditto Reading. And Rugby. Islington council is thinking about an outright ban; in Wolverhampton, chuggers have been threatened with fines. The police are getting brassed off in Shrewsbury: \"People have been known to chase general members of the public down the street,\" says a police spokesperson. In response, the Public Fundraising Regulatory Association (PFRA) \u2013 which regulates chugging \u2013 has claimed that as much as \u00a345m is given \"on the street\" every year. And charities such as Amnesty International say they expect to sign up around a quarter of their new members this year through street-to-street fundraising. But there again, perhaps we should cry fewer tears than some people would like. In 2010, an investigation by Newsnight found that charities were paying an average of \u00a3100 to the agencies who provide chuggers, which meant that if you signed up to pay \u00a35 a month, you had to wait well over a year for your money to go where you intended. The previous year, the PFRA revealed that around 55% of donors recruited in 2008 via street fundraisers cancelled their donation within 12 months, which effectively meant that charities saw almost no benefit from their temporary generosity at all. Four years ago, an undercover investigation by Intelligent Giving encountered chuggers who falsely claimed to be working as volunteers, someone chugging on behalf of the WRVS who didn't know that the W stands for \"women's\", and more. Intelligent Giving's director, Adam Rothwell, said : \"By employing chuggers who may be breaking the law, tell lies, or refuse to leave members of the public alone, charities undermine the trust we all instinctively have in them.\" He went on: \"Instead of succumbing to chuggers' pressure tactics, charity supporters should give direct to the cause by donating online.\" In other words, even if you believe in some kind of philanthropic ideal, chuggers seem to now be in danger of miring charities in controversy and bad feeling. For all the cash-raising feats they have managed in the past, charities may wonder: what happens when your treasured brand becomes equated with nuisance, insincerity and rather questionable business practices (something Greenpeace sussed out eight long years ago, though they've apparently reconsidered). \"The returns are questionable and the public just doesn't seem to like it,\" says one critic of chugging.

      "bodyText": "Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite national park has supplied San Francisco with pristine drinking water from the snowmelt in the High Sierras for almost 90 years. But radical plans to remove the dam and reverse almost a century of ecological damage to \"Yosemite's twin\" valley have reignited a decades-old battle between conservationists and the city's residents and their elected representatives. Restore Hetch Hetchy (RHH) last month filed to have an initiative included on the ballot for this November's elections and has until July to collect 7,400 signatures in support of the ballot measure. The campaigners hope to restore the valley to its natural state, bringing back wildlife and creating access for hikers and other visitors. \"Yosemite belongs to the American people; it does not belong to the ratepayers of San Francisco,\" said Mike Marshall, executive director of RHH. The city uses the fresh water \"to flush our toilets, wash our dogs and clean our streets,\" with only the tiniest amount recycled for use on golf courses, he added. Previous attempts to remove the O'Shaughnessy dam that stems the free flow of the Tuolumne River have failed. But the RHH campaign appears to be gathering momentum, with high-profile backing from supporters such as Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia outdoor clothing. Some 500 dams have been removed in the US during the past 15 years and on increasingly larger scales. Last autumn, work began to remove the 200-foot Elwha River dam in Washington state. Congress passed the Raker Act in 1913, granting water rights to San Francisco, and the O'Shaughnessy dam was completed 10 years later. The reservoir stores 117bn gallons of water that is so pure, it is exempt from filtration regulations. San Francisco residents would still drink water from the Tuolumne River under the RHH's proposals, but storage would be added elsewhere along the 167-mile system. Marshall said: \"In the past there was a belief that only Congress could undo what Congress did and we know after lots of legal research that the voters can voluntarily reform the water system and remove the reservoir.\" But San Francisco's mayor, Ed Lee, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and Senator Dianne Feinstein strongly object to the removal of the dam. Some 2.6 million people in the San Francisco Bay area drink water from the Yosemite national park and hydropower from the dam generates 1.6bn kilowatt hours a year of clean electricity which runs the city's buses and light rail, schools, police stations, street lighting and famous cable cars. Lee said: \"This initiative is a costly and unnecessary endeavour that would dismantle a clean and efficient source of water and power that serves millions of San Francisco Bay area residents and businesses. San Francisco is extremely fortunate to have a sustainable, greenhouse gas-free system already in place. Dismantling it makes absolutely no sense.\" A report from the California State Department of Water Resources estimated that restructuring the water supply to San Francisco would cost between $3bn and $10bn. Sarah E Null, now an assistant professor at the watershed sciences department at Utah State University, has published a paper on the feasibility of removing the dam. \"I found that you could take out the O'Shaughnessy dam and there would be very little water scarcity,\" she said. \"I love Yosemite, I call it the happiest place on Earth. But it's a very crowded place. Having another valley for tourism and recreation would also bring in some more money.\" If the ballot measure is passed in November, it will lead to a four-year planning process, which will then be voted on by San Franciscans.",

But radical plans to remove the dam and reverse almost a century of ecological damage to \"Yosemite's twin\" valley have reignited a decades-old battle between conservationists and the city's residents and their elected representatives.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hetchhetchy.org/\" title=\"\">Restore Hetch Hetchy</a> (RHH) last month filed to have an initiative included on the ballot for this November's elections and has until July to collect 7,400 signatures in support of the ballot measure. The campaigners hope to restore the valley to its natural state, bringing back wildlife and creating access for hikers and other visitors.</p> <p>\"Yosemite belongs to the American people; it does not belong to the ratepayers of San Francisco,\" said Mike Marshall, executive director of RHH. The city uses the fresh water \"to flush our toilets, wash our dogs and clean our streets,\" with only the tiniest amount recycled for use on golf courses, he added.</p> <p>Previous attempts to remove the O'Shaughnessy dam that stems the free flow of the Tuolumne River have failed. But the RHH campaign appears to be gathering momentum, with high-profile backing from supporters such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/feb/25/ethicalliving.theobserver\" title=\"\">Yvon Chouinard</a>, the founder of Patagonia outdoor clothing. Some 500 dams have been removed in the US during the past 15 years and on increasingly larger scales. Last autumn, work began to remove the 200-foot Elwha River dam in Washington state.</p> <p>Congress passed the <a href=\"http://www.sfmuseum.org/hetch/hetchy.html\" title=\"\">Raker Act</a> in 1913, granting water rights to San Francisco, and the O'Shaughnessy dam was completed 10 years later. The reservoir stores 117bn gallons of water that is so pure, it is exempt from filtration regulations. San Francisco residents would still drink water from the Tuolumne River under the RHH's proposals, but storage would be added elsewhere along the 167-mile system.</p> <p>Marshall said: \"In the past there was a belief that only Congress could undo what Congress did and we know after lots of legal research that the voters can voluntarily reform the water system and remove the reservoir.\"</p> <p>But San Francisco's mayor, Ed Lee, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and Senator Dianne Feinstein strongly object to the removal of the dam.

Marina Lewycka published her first novel, the hysterically funny A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, at the age of 58. Three more novels from her have shown this was no flash in the pan. My old journalist friend Wendy Wallace's first novel, The Painted Bridge, is out in May, and if the quality of her reportage is anything to go by, it will at least be powerfully written.

But our concerns are often those of youth. My latest play, The London Spring, imagines London after a few more years of inequality, economic decline and neoliberal government, in which Londoners are reduced to begging in the streets from wealthy foreign tourists. It speaks to contemporary concerns in a way that a lot of work by younger writers doesn't. I think much of the blame lies with master's degrees in playwriting. Far more often than not, emerging young playwrights come out of these, most often the pioneering course started in Birmingham by David Edgar. This is hardly surprising. The qualification is reassuring to a management taking a risk on an untried writer, and the teachers are well plugged into theatre managements. When I started work on plays, nearly two decades ago, I thought of doing the Birmingham course, but I had small children then. There were the fees, and they insisted you did it full-time. I did evening classes at London's City Lit instead. Very good they were too, but nothing like as well-connected.

WHAT YOU NEED: Download the PDF of your cutting layout 1 yard of 44/45\" flannel fabric 1 spool of coordinating thread 6 1/2\u2001yards of 1/4\u200a\"-wide double-fold bias tape Finished dimensions: 42\" wide 35\" tall, not including ties Seam allowance:\u20011/2\" unless otherwise specified WHAT TO DO: 1. Measure, mark, and cut Fold your fabric in half lengthwise, with the right sides together, aligning the selvages. Position the pattern pieces according to the layout and cut them out. \u2022 Blanket (cut 1 on fold) \u2022 Swaddle ties (cut 2) Note: position the blanket piece along the lengthwise grain of the fabric and the ties along the bias. 2. Make the ties Stitch the swaddle ties together with a French seam as follows: \u2022 With the wrong sides together, pin the straight edges of the swaddle ties together. Stitch, using a scant 1/4\u200a\" seam allowance. \u2022 Turn the fabrics wrong side out, so that the right sides are now together, and stitch another \u200a1/4\" seam to enclose the raw edges of the previous seam (note that your total seam allowance equals \u20011/2\"). \u2022 Press the seam allowance to one side and topstitch the seam in place close to the folded edge. 3. Bind the pieces Bind the edges of the blanket along all three sides using the double-fold bias tape: \u2022 Unfold one edge of the bias tape and pin it in place along the raw edge of the blanket with the right sides together. \u2022 Stitch using a \u200a1/4\" seam allowance. \u2022 Refold the bias tape along the original fold line, turning it to the wrong side of the blanket and encasing the unfinished edge. \u2022 Press, pin, and stitch in place close to the folded edge. \u2022 Repeat the above steps to bind the raw edge of the swaddle ties. 4. Attach the ties to the blanket \u2022Download the PDF visual guide \u2022 With both right sides facing up, position the seam of the swaddle ties along the center of the blanket 3\" down from the top edge and pin it in place. To make it easier, you might want to mark the center of the blanket with a washable fabric pen. \u2022 Mark with a pin at 6 1/2\" down from the top edge of the blanket, and at 10 1/2\" down from the top edge along the swaddle ties seam. \u2022 Using a zigzag or other strong decorative stitch, stitch the ties in place down the center of the blanket, leaving an opening between the two marks. 5. Using the blanket Lay the blanket with wrong side facing up. Position your baby with his shoulders below the top edge of the blanket. Fold up the bottom point, and wrap the right and left points of the triangle across his body, tucking the points of the triangle into the opening left in the previous step. Wrap the swaddle ties to the front of his body and tie in place. Finally, enjoy a peaceful night's sleep!",

Administrators are looking to strip \u00a31m per month from the Rangers budget but players at the club believe the target can be all-but met without a batch of sackings and continue to press home that case. One offer by the players to defer wages until the summer has already been flatly rejected although the man fronting a consortium hoping to takeover at Ibrox, Paul Murray, has written to administrators to point out he would rather inherit that scenario than one which would see serious funds needing to be invested in new players at the end of the season. After four hours of discussions on Monday, what has been described as a \"complicated\" model has now been offered by the players. Paul Clark, Rangers' joint administrator, said: \"Everyone involved in the administration process has been attempting to reach a consensual solution in regard to job losses within the playing squad. The prime reason for this has been to achieve essential cost savings while preserving the fabric of the first team. \"This has not been an easy balance to strike and we would like to thank the manager Ally McCoist, his players and the PFA Scotland for attempting to find a solution that would be workable for all. Every realistic option is being explored. \"Regrettably, it has not been possible thus far to reach a consensus where players could accept the necessary level of wage cuts to prevent job losses within the squad. We do not for a moment criticise the players for this as the wage reductions that would be required are very substantial and would have a significant impact on each individual. \"For clarity, we cannot enforce wage cuts. The players have to agree to this course of action. The players have asked us to consider a final proposal overnight for discussion in the morning and we have agreed to this request.\" The Scottish Premier League has announced the opening of an investigation into Rangers' contract arrangements since the inception of the league in 1998. Rangers' use of employee benefit trusts to pay players is central to the investigation. One of the club's former directors, Hugh Adam, alleged last week that such payments were detailed in contracts separate to those lodged with the football authorities; which would represent a potential rule breach. The Scottish FA is already scrutinising the affair. Neil Doncaster, the SPL's chief executive, said: \"We will be looking into it and taking whatever action is necessary. We'll be dealing with the administrators at Rangers to establish the facts, to establish whether there were any payments that were made that were undisclosed at that time. If there are, then we'll take that forward. Our role here is to apply the SPL rule book. We'll conduct the investigation as quickly as we can.\" Gary Withey, Rangers' company secretary and the man most closely associated with Craig Whyte's now tainted takeover of the club last May, has left his position as a partner at the legal firm Collyer Bristow. David Whitehouse, Rangers' joint administrator, said that contacting Withey has proved problematic; the departure from Collyer Bristow is reportedly for \"family and personal reasons.\"",

      "bodyText": "With the tobacco industry under fire at a Royal College of Physicians' conference 50 years after it first warned of the dangers of smoking, cigarette companies are also out of favour in the City. The two major quoted UK companies, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco, have outperformed the FTSE 100 by 35% and 29% since their low point in January 2011, said analyst Martin Deboo at Investec Securities, and they have continued to outperform in recent months. So he now feels valuations are looking a little high, and he has turned more cautious on the sector: We call the top on UK tobaccos and downgrade our recommendations on BAT and Imperial from buy to hold. The 2013 full year earnings outlook remain solid and industry mood music is upbeat. Weighing against this is massive sector out-performance in 2011, our bullish call on the wider market, relative valuations that look stretched and the resultant risk that the long run earnings and valuation equation gets re-scrutinised at this more demanding level. Time to sit on the sidelines we think. With tobacco stocks back on high relative valuations and fears of a plain packaging 'contagion' spreading from Australia, we see a risk that the sentimental climate on tobacco once again becomes more questioning and sceptical, in contrast to 2011's safety first mindset Imperial has been partly supported by hopes of a bid, from Japan Tobacco perhaps or BAT itself. But Deboo thinks much of this expectation is now in the share price: We have been consistently sceptical on Imperial's organic growth story, but we have paradoxically been enthusiastic buyers of the stock on the basis that we think it is a strong take-out prospect on a three year view. This remains our view today. However we think that at least some of this bid speculation has got into Imperial's price. We think that any take out of Imperial would require BAT to be a participant, most obviously in some sort of consortium with Japan Tobacco. However BAT's decision to increase its buyback feels like a negative signal to us. BAT is now paying out more than 100% of its free cash flow in dividends and buybacks and is signalling, in public at least, that it is interested in infill acquisitions only for the time being. At the moment, both companies have edged lower, with BAT down 4p at \u00a332.01 and Imperial 17p lower at \u00a325.17.",

      "bodyText": "The Bath flanker and former England captain, Lewis Moody, has announced his immediate retirement from rugby after an injury-affected career spanning 16 years in which he won a World Cup winners' medal. The 33-year-old retired from international rugby after captaining England at the 2011 World Cup. He earned 71 England caps in total and represented the British and Irish Lions on three occasions. \"It is with great sadness that I have to announce my immediate retirement from all forms of rugby. I have been very privileged to have played in some incredible teams and with some phenomenal players,\" Moody said on his official website. \"I owe a huge debt of gratitude to all the medics and physios who have put me back together time and time again to enable me to continue to play this wonderful sport of ours.\" Moody made his first appearance for Leicester in 1996 and went on to play for the club for 14 years until his move to Bath in 2010. Moody has won seven Premiership titles, two Heineken Cups, one LV Cup, two Six Nations Championship winners medals and his career highlight, a World Cup winners medal from 2003. \"I would like to thank all of the coaches that I have worked with during my career, from Bracknell minis to the British and Irish Lions; they have all left their mark on me as a player,\" Moody added. \"It goes without saying how much I value the fans who have supported me so loyally over the years, it has been one of life's singular pleasures to have played this game in front of you. \"Finally, I would not have achieved what I have in this sport without the continued support of my family and friends during my entire career. Rugby has been my life for such a long time now, it is scary to imagine what it will be like without it, but I look forward to relishing the new opportunities and adventures that will come my way.\" Martin Johnson, who played alongside Moody for Leicester and England before coaching him, said: \"When I look back at playing with Lewis it always brings a smile to my face \u2013 it was never dull. He was one of the most committed guys I ever played with and had a complete disregard for his own physical wellbeing. It's sad that he has had to retire but he should be remembered for a great career and someone who never gave less than 100% for his club and country.\" Sir Ian McGeechan, the director of rugby at Bath, said: \"Lewis has been a fantastic servant to the game, and I am disappointed I will not now have another opportunity to work with him on the training pitch and watch him deliver in a Bath jersey. He has had a tremendous career and is a player I have greatly admired. He is always fully committed and is everything any coach would want in a back row forward. \"He is someone whose opinion I trust and value, and he leaves a fantastic legacy from his time with Leicester, England and the Lions, which will long be remembered.\"",

      "bodyText": "The winner Back in September 2003, Calendar Girls bucked the usual downward trend for cinema grosses by rising 5% on its second weekend of play. Now history repeats, as The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which is similarly targeted at older cinemagoers, rises by an identical amount in its second frame, with takings of \u00a32.34m, knocking The Woman in Black off the top spot. Thanks also to a solid midweek performance \u2013 the audience for this film is so far proving happy to come out any day of the week \u2013 it has now achieved a highly impressive \u00a37.01m after just 10 days of play. By comparison, Calendar Girls stood at \u00a35.68m at this stage of play \u2013 although of course ticket prices were significantly lower eight and a half years ago. Calendar Girls ended up with \u00a320.43m. If Marigold Hotel continues along a similar trajectory \u2013 and it's too early to say whether that will occur \u2013 it will reach \u00a325m-plus. Backers 20th Century Fox would presumably be more than happy simply to match the gross of director John Madden's previous biggest hit, Shakespeare in Love (\u00a320.81m). The success arrives as a timely boost for Madden. His crime drama Killshot, filmed in late 2005, spent years in limbo, before being released in the US in January 2009, on just five screens. More recently, The Debt also saw its release held up due to the sale of backers Miramax, although it was eventually distributed by Universal, achieving a US gross of $31m and a UK total of \u00a31.53m. Most of the Marigold Hotel cast members are no strangers to word-of-mouth crowdpleasers. Dev Patel starred in Slumdog Millionaire (\u00a331.66m), Tom Wilkinson in The Full Monty (\u00a352.23m) and Bill Nighy in Love Actually (\u00a336.80m). Penelope Wilton and Celia Imrie were both in Calendar Girls. Despite a revenue split that favours cinemas, and marketing costs which must be recouped out of the distributor's revenue portion, Marigold Hotel should eventually emerge as a nice earner for Fox. Production budget is rumoured to be in the \u00a38-9m range. The runner-up Marigold Hotel isn't the only holdover title doing excellent business. Despite dropping a place in the chart, The Woman in Black shrugged off the challenge of several new wide releases (see below), declining just 22% for its fourth frame, and lifting its total to \u00a317.63m. That pushes it past The Silence of the Lambs for third place in the all-time UK box-office horror chart, behind just I Am Legend (\u00a325.88m) and Hannibal (\u00a321.58m) \u2013 unless you count the three Twilight sequels, which are all in the \u00a327-31m range. The newbies Three new Hollywood offerings, all released on 300-plus screens, landed inside the top 10. Best of the lot is This Means War, which opened with a decent \u00a31.82m, including \u00a3300,000 in previews. Reese Witherspoon's last picture Water for Elephants debuted in May 2011 with \u00a31.27m, while her last comedy, How Do You Know, kicked off with a lacklustre \u00a3375,000 earlier that year. This Means War convincingly out-performed rival comedy Wanderlust, starring Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. This latest item from the Judd Apatow factory debuted with a disappointing \u00a3491,000, although this is pretty much in line with its recent US opening of $6.5m. It's also slightly better than the first weekend for Aniston and Rudd's previous pairing, 1998's The Object of My Affection: \u00a3340,000. One title that was always tricky to forecast is Project X, a celebration of teenage debauchery from debut director Nima Nourizadeh and producer Todd Phillips (The Hangover). In the US, an opening of $21.05m was very much in the Chronicle ($22m) range. In the UK, perhaps hampered by an 18 certificate, Project X achieved a debut of \u00a3562,000, compared with \u00a32.19m (including previews of \u00a3617,000) a few weeks ago for Chronicle. Project X prompted a highly diverse set of critical reactions, as measured by MetaCritic. With a mean score of 48, a majority are either 70 or above, or 30 or below. On both sides of the Atlantic, teens may have bought tickets for other titles and snuck into Project X, inflating the grosses of rival titles at the party flick's expense. In the US, minors may see Project X if accompanied by adults, but this is hardly a picture that teens want to see with their parents. The Oscar bounce Following five major Oscar wins the previous Sunday, The Artist saw takings rise by 33% on its tenth week of release, as its screen count broke through the 300 barrier for the first time. With cumulative takings to date of \u00a38.50m, it's the second-biggest grosser of the best picture Oscar nominees, behind War Horse (\u00a318.31m). The Iron Lady, which missed out on a best picture nomination but secured a win for Meryl Streep in the actress category, has reached \u00a39.52m. The future For the first time in 2012, weekend takings are up on the equivalent frame from 2011. Cinemas still have a lot of ground to recover, but there will be general relief that a corner has been turned. Of course, a year ago The King's Speech was such a big bonus treat that 2012 was always going to struggle to match first-quarter grosses. This week, Disney will be looking for strong returns for its epic production John Carter, which has the look and scale of a summer blockbuster. Also in the mix are period thriller The Raven, starring John Cusack, and literary adaptation Bel Ami, with Robert Pattinson. Five British pictures of various genres \u2013 Payback Season, Trishna, Cleanskin, Hard Boiled Sweets and Decoy Bride \u2013 are also competing for audiences. Top 10 films 1.

Dev Patel starred in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126911/slumdog-millionaire\" title=\"\">Slumdog Millionaire</a> (\u00a331.66m), Tom Wilkinson in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/69487/full.monty\" title=\"\">The Full Monty</a> (\u00a352.23m) and Bill Nighy in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/96863/love.actually\" title=\"\">Love Actually</a> (\u00a336.80m). Penelope Wilton and Celia Imrie were both in Calendar Girls. Despite a revenue split that favours cinemas, and marketing costs which must be recouped out of the distributor's revenue portion, Marigold Hotel should eventually emerge as a nice earner for Fox. Production budget is rumoured to be in the \u00a38-9m range.</p> <h2>The runner-up</h2> <p>Marigold Hotel isn't the only holdover title doing excellent business. Despite dropping a place in the chart, The Woman in Black shrugged off the challenge of several new wide releases (see below), declining just 22% for its fourth frame, and lifting its total to \u00a317.63m. That pushes it past <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/39337/silence.of.the.lambs\" title=\"\">The Silence of the Lambs</a> for third place in the all-time UK box-office horror chart, behind just I Am Legend (\u00a325.88m) and Hannibal (\u00a321.58m) \u2013 unless you count the three Twilight sequels, which are all in the \u00a327-31m range.</p> <h2>The newbies</h2> <p>Three new Hollywood offerings, all released on 300-plus screens, landed inside the top 10. Best of the lot is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145708/this-means-war\" title=\"\">This Means War</a>, which opened with a decent \u00a31.82m, including \u00a3300,000 in previews. Reese Witherspoon's last picture <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141589/water-for-elephants\" title=\"\">Water for Elephants</a> debuted in May 2011 with \u00a31.27m, while her last comedy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137572/how-do-you-know\" title=\"\">How Do You Know</a>, kicked off with a lacklustre \u00a3375,000 earlier that year.</p> <p>This Means War convincingly out-performed rival comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146267/wanderlust\" title=\"\">Wanderlust</a>, starring Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. This latest item from the Judd Apatow factory debuted with a disappointing \u00a3491,000, although this is pretty much in line with its recent US opening of $6.5m. It's also slightly better than the first weekend for Aniston and Rudd's previous pairing, 1998's The Object of My Affection: \u00a3340,000.</p> <p>One title that was always tricky to forecast is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146298/project-x\" title=\"\">Project X</a>, a celebration of teenage debauchery from debut director Nima Nourizadeh and producer Todd Phillips (The Hangover). In the US, an opening of $21.05m was very much in the Chronicle ($22m) range. In the UK, perhaps hampered by an 18 certificate, Project X achieved a debut of \u00a3562,000, compared with \u00a32.19m (including previews of \u00a3617,000) a few weeks ago for Chronicle.</p> <p>Project X prompted a highly diverse set of critical reactions, as measured by MetaCritic. With a mean score of 48, a majority are either 70 or above, or 30 or below. On both sides of the Atlantic, teens may have bought tickets for other titles and snuck into Project X, inflating the grosses of rival titles at the party flick's expense. In the US, minors may see Project X if accompanied by adults, but this is hardly a picture that teens want to see with their parents.</p> <h2>The Oscar bounce</h2> <p>Following five major Oscar wins the previous Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142801/artist\" title=\"\">The Artist</a> saw takings rise by 33% on its tenth week of release, as its screen count broke through the 300 barrier for the first time. With cumulative takings to date of \u00a38.50m, it's the second-biggest grosser of the best picture Oscar nominees, behind War Horse (\u00a318.31m). The Iron Lady, which missed out on a best picture nomination but secured a win for Meryl Streep in the actress category, has reached \u00a39.52m.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>For the first time in 2012, weekend takings are up on the equivalent frame from 2011. Cinemas still have a lot of ground to recover, but there will be general relief that a corner has been turned. Of course, a year ago The King's Speech was such a big bonus treat that 2012 was always going to struggle to match first-quarter grosses. This week, Disney will be looking for strong returns for its epic production John Carter, which has the look and scale of a summer blockbuster. Also in the mix are period thriller The Raven, starring John Cusack, and literary adaptation Bel Ami, with Robert Pattinson. Five British pictures of various genres \u2013 Payback Season, Trishna, Cleanskin, Hard Boiled Sweets and Decoy Bride \u2013 are also competing for audiences.</p> <h2>Top 10 films</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, \u00a32,342,095 from 509 sites.

      "bodyText": "Russian punks Pussy Riot have been arrested over their February protest at Moscow's Christ the Saviour cathedral. Beginning on 3 March, the day before the presidential election that saw Vladimir Putin return to power, six band members were charged in connection with hate crimes and violations of public order. Two of the musicians remain in custody, where they have begun a hunger strike. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhin are protesting against the conditions of their arrest, which will see them kept behind bars until a late April hearing. They both have young children: Tolokonnikova has a four-year-old son and Alyokhin's daughter is five. The women \"will starve in jail until they are returned to their children\", Pussy Riot explained on their website. If the accused are found guilty, they face up to seven years in prison. \"These citizens were taken in on suspicion of committing a crime, one involving a gross violation of public order, including inciting religious hatred as part of a planned conspiracy,\" announced the government's press service. The band members claim they were interrogated for seven hours, beginning at 4am; the investigators allegedly revealed the case was being directed \"from the highest levels\", with a focus not just on Pussy Riot's protest but on \"all anti-state activities\". Pussy Riot comprises 10 members and dozens of supporting \"staff\", who have helped organise guerrilla performances in Moscow. Notorious for their colourful balaclavas, miniskirts and tights, they criticise Russia's authoritarianism, pushing for judicial, educational and cultural reform. \"Russia did not have enough explosive punk-feminist groups, pushing people to the development of a culture of protest,\" members explained to Gazeta.ru last month. \"Our concerts were to become a pure protest saying: superheroes in balaclavas and acid bright tights seize public space in Moscow.\" Pussy Riot's most famous flash gig took place at Christ the Saviour on 21 February. Five members broke into the Moscow cathedral, performing a \"punk prayer\" from the altar. This song, titled Holy Shit, was a condemnation of the Russian Orthodox church's close ties to Putin. \"Holy Mother, Blessed Virgin,\" they sang, \"chase Putin out!\" \"Our patriarch is not ashamed of wearing watches worth $40,000, which is intolerable when so many families in Russia are on the edge of poverty,\" Pussy Riot explained. \"Our position is to think critically, to doubt all 'natural' things, and find lies.\"",

      "bodyText": "Bloggers, memoirists, novelists, short story writers, poets and publishers filled a conference centre in Bristol on Saturday, talking about creative energy, censorship, cache plug-ins, Google indexing, pen names ... and words for penetration. The common thread was sex. Eroticon 2012 was the UK's first ever conference for sex writers, reflecting the explosion over the last decade in promulgating one's personal life. First came the book version of Belle de Jour's blog in 2005, then the Girl with a One Track Mind book a year later. Together they seemed to spur a publishing craze for sex confessionals. That led to emulation blogs in their thousands, mostly by women. Now almost every newspaper and magazine has some sort of single girl column, airing phases of her love life. It isn't just first-person narratives. So-called 'clit lit' - saucy fiction for women - is on the up, especially in the e-world. Mills and Boon says its electronic downloads doubled in 2010, and in the past few years mainstream publishers such as Random House, Penguin and Simon &amp; Schuster have all inaugurated erotica imprints. What caused this appetite for over-sharing? Have women suddenly, mysteriously become more libidinous? Is it that delving into that forbidden part of the imagination is extra cathartic for writers? Or has it just become cool? It wasn't so long ago that Lady Chatterley's Lover was being burned by a horrified public. As recently as 2002, the explicit scenes in The Sexual Life of Catherine M ruffled many feathers. Zoe Margolis, the blogger behind Girl with a One Track Mind, was one of Saturday's speakers. \"It's not about exposure, it's about expression,\" she said. \"Writing helps place your thoughts. You can't ignore the technology available today and where we are in self-publishing. We are in a certain period of expression. People have seen that you can have a wonderful catharsis in getting your views and experiences out. Plus, there is a desire to read it. Women are embracing that. They are finding a platform that isn't available in mainstream media.\" Sex blogger doesn't have to mean sex confessor. For many, it's about erotic prose or reviews. Jill Boyd, 21, is a virgin and uses her blog to track her sexual development. \"Starting a blog was my way of understanding the sex world,\" she said. \"At one point I got into porn and masturbation and I wrote about my feelings to understand it. Then I started to write fiction and now I've been published in an anthology by Naughty Nights Press.\" The Exotic Lady publishes short stories: \"I have three different blogs but I enjoy the erotic fiction best because it's more interactive. People are more vocal about whether they think it's good or not. I get far more comments and feedback on my writing. On Twitter I see more and more sex bloggers. That isn't a bad thing. If more people are doing it, it proves to the industry that we are viable.\" This idea of quashing taboo was a common one at Eroticon. But if sex writers are so intent on this, why do so few use their real names? Last year my first book was published, Sugar Daddy Diaries, a confessional memoir of my penchant for older men. I had planned to use a pseudonym but by the time publication came around, I felt comfortable enough about my subject matter that I was proud to use my real name. I expected and wanted to be judged by my work, not by the activities I wrote about. For others, it isn't so simple. Vina Green is a guest writer for sacredpleasures.co.uk, and that's her pen name. \"I work in sales so my image to the public needs to be a blank canvas,\" she said. \"While I might be comfortable knowing things about [clients'] personal tastes, they may want a totally conservative relationship with me. If they knew I wrote about my sex life I could be a threat to them, or I could be seen to be a publicity threat to my company.\" 'Faerie' describes himself as a male sexual pioneer. He hosts a BDSM blog under his pseudonym. \"I'm open about what I do in every context except my family and my bank,\" he explains. Monique Roffey is author of With the kisses of his mouth, a memoir of her sexual conquests to mend her broken heart. Already an established novelist, she says it was a big move to make herself the story. \"It's about time that women who write about sex nail their flag to the mast and say 'I'm going to put my name to it'. It's important to put to the mainstream public that, 'Hey, I've got no shame about this. This is all true. This is me.' It occludes the taboo if you do.\" In France, it is common for a prize-winning literary author to occasionally write a book about sex, and those books are reviewed very seriously. In Britain, associations with erotica or sex confessionals linger dangerously close to smut. Margolis, who was famously ousted by a Sunday newspaper, knows a lot about this. \"I chose to use a pseudonym because I feared judgement\", she said. \"I felt more empowered when I was anonymous because I was unrestrained. I miss that, but the flipside is that now I have a platform to talk publicly about sexual attitudes and hopefully I can help change things. I've received thousands of messages over the years from women saying 'Me too! I felt the same!' I'm nothing extraordinary whatsoever, I just spoke louder than other people. It's lovely to see so many women writing about sex. In 2004 an event like this simply could not have happened.\" \u2022 Helen Croydon is the author of Sugar Daddy Diaries and 100 Lessons on Sex.",

Margolis, who was famously ousted by a Sunday newspaper, knows a lot about this.</p> <p>\"I chose to use a pseudonym because I feared judgement\", she said. \"I felt more empowered when I was anonymous because I was unrestrained. I miss that, but the flipside is that now I have a platform to talk publicly about sexual attitudes and hopefully I can help change things. I've received thousands of messages over the years from women saying 'Me too! I felt the same!' I'm nothing extraordinary whatsoever, I just spoke louder than other people. It's lovely to see so many women writing about sex.

CloudStore is set to revolutionise the purchasing, management and delivery of public sector IT services \u2013 and the way suppliers work with government.

Their ability to gain government contracts should help stimulate future growth in these businesses. A more competitive market also allows the government to ensure it is achieving the best value for money. CloudStore also heralds a giant step forward towards the end of lengthy ICT contracts, as no contract is longer than 12 months and some as short as one month. Buyers know from the outset the cost of the product and, importantly, the cost of ending the contracts. This provides the flexibility to change service provider easily if a buyer is not happy with the service they receive. It also saves money by avoiding duplication of services that cannot be shared.

A little discourteous, to say the least. But far more worrying was the fact that the minister, in answering my question, then appeared to try to conceal the government's original intentions on the hugely controversial forest sell-off. Let me place two statements on selling public forests by the honorable member in front of you, and you can be the judge. The first is from 24 November 2010: \"Part of our policy is clearly established: we wish to proceed with, to correctly use your word, very substantial disposal of public forest estate, which could go to the extent of all of it.\" The second is from 19 January 2012: \"In fact, there never was any intention to dispose of the whole public forest estate.\" Now you may think this is the kind of thing that gives politicians a bad name. I couldn't possibly comment. But an interested observer might speculate that it was precisely this lack of coherence from the minister that has since resulted in the forests brief being taken from him and handed to a junior colleague. What I will say is that there is a glimmer of hope in these two contradictory statements. It looks as if the government is planning a further U-turn on selling off our forests, and in preparation for this, is trying to rewrite history. After their initial proposals were announced in 2011 \u2013 designed to raise money for the Treasury, rather than benefit our forests \u2013 there was uproar. Hundreds of thousands of people protested and signed petitions, with everyone from 38 Degrees to the Woodland Trust voicing criticism of the government's approach. Eventually the coalition climbed down by announcing a review of the whole future of forestry in England and Wales by an independent panel \u2013 so delaying the problem for a year or more. The panel's interim report has ruled out flogging off the Forestry Commission to raise cash. With luck, the panel may even come up with a positive vision, including boosting employment in forestry and forest crafts, protecting and restoring ancient woodlands, and planting more native and broadleaf woods. This is what the public wants, and if the government accepts this agenda, then something good will have come from this mess. But this \"memory lapse\" is not a change of heart: the government would still sell the forests if they could. It's more an acceptance that they've gone too far. And let's not forget that the fate of 15% of public forest estate \u2013 that's 40,000 hectares \u2013 still hangs in the balance. Defra has refused to give any assurances that this land will be protected, leading to fears that the department remains wedded to the privatisation ideology which drove the pre U-turn proposals. Add to that the incredibly short-sighted decision by the government \u2013 taken before the forest panel has even reported \u2013 to impose big cuts on the Forestry Commission, resulting in 400 job losses. With so many battles still to be won, public pressure remains crucial. And when the forestry panel report eventually comes out this year, we'll need another big public effort to show the government we still care and make sure our forest heritage is not put at risk.",

Security technician Joshua Thompson hopes to convince a judge that his local AMC theatre in Livonia, a city within the Detroit metropolitan area, is breaking state consumer protection laws. He has filed a class-action suit at the Wayne County circuit court in southern Michigan asking for affected filmgoers to be refunded and calls for the cinema to be hit with a civil penalty. \"He got tired of being taken advantage of,\" Kerry Morgan, Thompson's lawyer, told the Detroit Free Press. \"It's hard to justify prices that are three and four times higher than anywhere else.\" Thompson says he paid $8 for a Coke and a packet of Goobers chocolate-covered peanuts at the Livonia AMC cinema on Boxing Day last year, nearly three times the $2.73 he would have been charged for the same snacks at a nearby fast-food restaurant and drug store. He said he used to take his own snacks into the cinema to avoid paying high prices, but was forced to stop when staff put up a notice stating that the practice was banned. American Multi Cinema, which operates the AMC in Livonia, have not yet responded, but legal experts told the Press they did not expect Thompson's suit to succeed because licensed venues are exempt from consumer laws in Michigan. His case is just the latest bizarre attempt by a US filmgoer to secure compensation through the courts in the wake of a bad cinema experience. In October 2011, Sarah Deming sued the distributor of critically acclaimed Ryan Gosling thriller Drive \u2013 as well as the cinema where she saw it \u2013 claiming the film was publicised as a Fast and Furious-style action piece but turned out to be nothing of the sort. In her suit, which was filed at the sixth judicial circuit court in Oakland, Michigan, Deming said the Nicolas Winding Refn film \"bore very little similarity to a chase, or race action film ... having very little driving in the motion picture\".",

He has filed a class-action suit at the Wayne County circuit court in southern Michigan asking for affected filmgoers to be refunded and calls for the cinema to be hit with a civil penalty.</p> <p>\"He got tired of being taken advantage of,\" Kerry Morgan, Thompson's lawyer, told the Detroit Free Press. \"It's hard to justify prices that are three and four times higher than anywhere else.\"</p> <p>Thompson says he paid $8 for a Coke and a packet of Goobers chocolate-covered peanuts at the Livonia AMC cinema on Boxing Day last year, nearly three times the $2.73 he would have been charged for the same snacks at a nearby fast-food restaurant and drug store. He said he used to take his own snacks into the cinema to avoid paying high prices, but was forced to stop when staff put up a notice stating that the practice was banned.</p> <p>American Multi Cinema, which operates the AMC in Livonia, have not yet responded, but legal experts told the Press they did not expect Thompson's suit to succeed because licensed venues are exempt from consumer laws in Michigan.</p> <p>His case is just the latest bizarre attempt by a US filmgoer to secure compensation through the courts in the wake of a bad cinema experience. In October 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/10/woman-sues-drive-trailer\" title=\"\">Sarah Deming sued the distributor</a> of critically acclaimed Ryan Gosling thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142036/drive\" title=\"\">Drive</a> \u2013 as well as the cinema where she saw it \u2013 claiming the film was publicised as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129189/fast-and-furious\" title=\"\">Fast and Furious</a>-style action piece but turned out to be nothing of the sort.</p> <p>In her suit, which was filed at the sixth judicial circuit court in Oakland, Michigan, Deming said the Nicolas Winding Refn film \"bore very little similarity to a chase, or race action film ... having very little driving in the motion picture\".</p>",

The truth is that I rarely have reason to complain about this newspaper. But today I'm afraid I must do so. Last Friday, The Guardian ran a story headlined Republicans blamed for shooting of west Belfast man. It concerned the killing of Christopher (Christy) Mackin, who was shot dead in Belfast's city centre the night before. The story, written by the paper's Irish correspondent, Henry McDonald, stated that \"Republican paramilitaries\" had been responsible for the \"paramilitary-style assassination.\" Leaving aside the wrong use of the term \"assassination\", it cited \"Republican sources\" as saying it \"was likely that a republican organisation had targeted Mackin over allegations he had been dealing drugs.\" However, the police issued a statement denying any paramilitary link. Detective Chief Inspector John McVea of the PSNI said: \"We are not looking at paramilitary involvement. We arrested a man and woman in Belfast this morning.\" That statement was carried on the BBC website. A man of 40 and a woman of 35 were later charged with murder and are due to appear in court today, as the Belfast Telegraph reported. Until the two were charged I could have written more about the incident but I can say with confidence that another story in the Belfast Telegraph and a Facebook page both underlined that the killing was totally unrelated to paramilitaries. What concerns me about The Guardian story was the message that it sends. I am not in any doubt about the threat posed by republican dissidents. But it is clear that this small group feeds off any publicity that implies it is larger and more active than is really the case. The net effect of the headline and story is to bolster the \"prowess\" of a group that wishes to pursue a murderous armed campaign. There is a second, slightly more sinister, message too. The use of the word \"republican\" in such a context tends to taint the republican movement as a whole, meaning Sinn Fein. Reporting in Northern Ireland remains a sensitive matter and this inaccurate report, sadly, was anything but sensitive.",

      "bodyText": "Antigua's cricketing knight celebrates with a round of golf on the island's blissful Cedar Valley course while the cricketing world wishes happy returns to one of its most imperishable monarchs. Can it really be 21 years since that cathartic Test match finale at The Oval when an enraptured full house rose in farewell as, at the pavilion gate, Sir Viv Richards turned to doff his faded old maroon cap to all sides in courtly acknowledgement? The landmark birthdays of heroes always serve to underline our own mortality and with Wednesday's three-score anniversary comes the stark personal realisation that it is more than half my lifetime ago since the eye-popping double-take that day I first set eyes on Richards 38 midsummers ago at Somerset's dear old Bath Festival in 1974 when the gangly young smiler, glistening with gaiety and adventure, clocked Yorkshire's Test bowlers Chris Old and Geoff Cope all over in a festive flurry of sixes. A new star had risen in the west. Mind you, I had gone prepared as fully a month before, in Viv's third first-class innings for the county, against Sussex and England's full-lick John Snow at Hove in May, in the Daily Telegraph EW Swanton, of all people, had enthused: \"Seeing the fondness of the young Antiguan for the hook, Snow now posted a second long-leg to him. Richards' answer was to hit him for 14 in an over including two of the sweetest hooks you ever saw dissecting the space between the two. He sees the ball very early and hits it mighty hard.\" I have been lucky: a few times I dined with and laughed into the night with Lord Learie Constantine. I once watched the cricket from high in the bleachers at Sabina Park, sharing boiled sweets with a chuckling George Headley. The glorious cricket of those two was a prophecy for the sheer luck of my generation which has been able not only to marvel at all of Richards' narrative from that joyous youth of Bath to potentate's full global pomp but fore and aft of him, those two peerless lefties of history, Sir Garfield Sobers and Brian Lara. And, glory be, I am of an age to be even more fortunate, for I saw bat, too, that trio of titans forever inseparably enjoined as the three Ws \u2013 each also knights of their realm \u2013 Sir Frank Worrell, Sir Clyde Walcott and (still with us and 87 last week) Everton Weekes. The three Barbadian amigos were born within 18 months and less than a couple of miles of each other but at the crease they were three of a wholly distinctive style: Worrell silkily assured and subtle; Walcott the great bear, hairy of arm and bludgeon for bat; Weekes the restless welterweight, light on his feet, fiercely ebullient for the fight. I was just a 12-year old gaping in wonder on the boundary grass when Walcott and Weekes fashioned a century stand of blazing grandeur together in 1950 at the Cheltenham College ground. All of three decades later I took them both to lunch in Barbados. Might they just remember that Cheltenham day in 1950 which so beguiled a child? A heap of hints and no reaction till, all of a sudden, Walcott's face broke into a wide grin of recollection: \"Oh yes, Cheltenham: as we went out to bat after tea, this good fellow\" \u2013 and he leant across to put a huge ham of an arm around Weekes's shoulder \u2013 \"nodded towards the stately College buildings and said: 'This is a famous academic establishment, man, so why don't we give them a display of some famous academic batting, eh?'\" \"Academic batting\": not quite what you think of with birthday-boy Richards. Vengefully scary, more like. Isaac Vivian Alexander. What Christian names for an emperor. Well, he batted like one. His very strut to the wicket intimidated even the most certain of bowlers. By the time he had taken guard, then fixed them with an eye, many were already quivering wrecks. For Viv it was all about nobility and pride; most of all it was burning self-belief.

Viv overwhelmingly stole the show: \"My bat was my sword.

      "body": "<p>Antigua's cricketing knight celebrates with a round of golf on the island's blissful Cedar Valley course while the cricketing world wishes happy returns to one of its most imperishable monarchs. Can it really be 21 years since that cathartic Test match finale at The Oval when an enraptured full house rose in farewell as, at the pavilion gate, Sir Viv Richards turned to doff his faded old maroon cap to all sides in courtly acknowledgement?</p> <p>The landmark birthdays of heroes always serve to underline our own mortality and with Wednesday's three-score anniversary comes the stark personal realisation that it is more than half my lifetime ago since the eye-popping double-take that day I first set eyes on Richards 38 midsummers ago at Somerset's dear old Bath Festival in 1974 when the gangly young smiler, glistening with gaiety and adventure, clocked Yorkshire's Test bowlers Chris Old and Geoff Cope all over in a festive flurry of sixes. A new star had risen in the west.</p> <p>Mind you, I had gone prepared as fully a month before, in Viv's third first-class innings for the county, against Sussex and England's full-lick John Snow at Hove in May, in the Daily Telegraph EW Swanton, of all people, had enthused: \"Seeing the fondness of the young Antiguan for the hook, Snow now posted a second long-leg to him. Richards' answer was to hit him for 14 in an over including two of the sweetest hooks you ever saw dissecting the space between the two. He sees the ball very early and hits it mighty hard.\"</p> <p>I have been lucky: a few times I dined with and laughed into the night with Lord Learie Constantine. I once watched the cricket from high in the bleachers at Sabina Park, sharing boiled sweets with a chuckling George Headley. The glorious cricket of those two was a prophecy for the sheer luck of my generation which has been able not only to marvel at all of Richards' narrative from that joyous youth of Bath to potentate's full global pomp but fore and aft of him, those two peerless lefties of history, Sir Garfield Sobers and Brian Lara. And, glory be, I am of an age to be even more fortunate, for I saw bat, too, that trio of titans forever inseparably enjoined as the three Ws \u2013 each also knights of their realm \u2013 Sir Frank Worrell, Sir Clyde Walcott and (still with us and 87 last week) Everton Weekes. The three Barbadian amigos were born within 18 months and less than a couple of miles of each other but at the crease they were three of a wholly distinctive style: Worrell silkily assured and subtle; Walcott the great bear, hairy of arm and bludgeon for bat; Weekes the restless welterweight, light on his feet, fiercely ebullient for the fight.</p> <p>I was just a 12-year old gaping in wonder on the boundary grass when Walcott and Weekes fashioned a century stand of blazing grandeur together in 1950 at the Cheltenham College ground. All of three decades later I took them both to lunch in Barbados. Might they just remember that Cheltenham day in 1950 which so beguiled a child? A heap of hints and no reaction till, all of a sudden, Walcott's face broke into a wide grin of recollection: \"Oh yes, Cheltenham: as we went out to bat after tea, this good fellow\" \u2013 and he leant across to put a huge ham of an arm around Weekes's shoulder \u2013 \"nodded towards the stately College buildings and said: 'This is a famous academic establishment, man, so why don't we give them a display of some famous academic batting, eh?'\"</p> <p>\"Academic batting\": not quite what you think of with birthday-boy Richards. Vengefully scary, more like. Isaac Vivian Alexander. What Christian names for an emperor. Well, he batted like one. His very strut to the wicket intimidated even the most certain of bowlers. By the time he had taken guard, then fixed them with an eye, many were already quivering wrecks. For Viv it was all about nobility and pride; most of all it was burning self-belief. Last week BBC4 screened Fire In Babylon, a watchable but vividly over-egged documentary on Caribbean cricket's dominance of a few decades ago. Viv overwhelmingly stole the show: \"My bat was my sword.

      "bodyText": "Two weeks ago a meal was organised in Leeds, where I was able to meet several of the hosts - the people I 'phone up to ask if they will put vulnerable asylum seekers up for a night. It was good to be able to put faces to the names and to explain why I sometimes might seem a little abrupt: it's because I'm running out of 'free' minutes on my phone and nothing to do with them! So the next day when I was co-ordinating Short Stop I knew several of the names on the list I was 'phoning, and maybe more next week. Thanks to Leeds Asylum Seekers Supporters Network for organising the meal. Last Wednesday was Coasties, at Ravenscar with the National Trust, and several different jobs; moving piles of previously cut gorse, broom and bramble from a small quarry area to somewhere it can be burned later in the year, clearing out a very clogged up ditch with much satisfaction when the water started to flow (I confess I was not involved with this job); and cutting back the ever present blackthorn. The mud and blackthorn also had to be moved, a heavy and difficult task. Whilst we work one of the Coasties 'admits' he will be 60 later in the year; those of us who already have our bus passes told him of the extra treats, such as cheap fish and chips in many cafes, from which we already benefit. I had forgotten my camera, but never mind; I got an 'award' for my blog from the Coasties - a lovely certificate and a set of quill pens for when my internet connection is down. One of the quills has a new-fangled biro in the end; the others will need some real ink! At the end of the afternoon we all decide that we have increased our heart rates by more than enough, going by the new guidelines on keeping fit, published recently. So thanks to the North York Moors national park for keeping us in good health, and mostly in good spirits. On Sunday, I did a voluntary ranger patrol from Rosedale. Several sections of the paths I walked along, checking for any problems, had been improved under the North York Moors, Coast and Hills LEADER programme. This is a partnership of local organisations, community groups and individuals who have secured \u00a33.1 million from Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union through the now sadly abolished Yorkshire Forward and One North East as part of the Rural Development Programme for England. Under this scheme, paths are made more accessible, seats provided where necessary and signing improved. My pictures show where a stile, a very difficult one made of stones, has been replaced by a gate. Although there were some parts of this particular path that were not flat, it was certainly earlier to use than others in the national park. People may wonder why this expenditure in a time of cutbacks; but walking has been shown to be so good for our mental and physical health that in the long run this could save the National Health Service far more money than has been spent. Besides, everyone is entitled to use the paths which are maintained by tax from all of us. Later on I am watched by some very curious goats and an unusual pig. The goats run after me. It's a bit early for milking; perhaps they think I might have some food. If so they are disappointed. And so, after a wonderful mix of paths and scenery, stream side, field edge, moor land and the old ironstone railway, I finish my patrol. A broken stile and a few misleading signs to report when I get home and then off to hear Joan Baez in York, a lovely end to a very good day.

      "bodyText": "The government has put London's mayor more directly in charge of the strategic direction and budget of the Metropolitan police and made him, formally at least, more directly accountable to the public. Some fear that this will politicise policing, but Kit Malthouse, who is Boris Johnson's appointee as head of the newly formed Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, argues that the Met has always responded to the demands of politicians. Both Johnson and Ken Livingstone before him have rather borne this out. So the constitutional subtleties are probably less important than the mayor's priorities and determination to see them implemented. What should those priorities be? Most politicians talk utter rubbish about crime. Terrified of being dubbed \"soft\" by the media, they spout \"get tough\" platitudes that the dimmest criminology undergraduate could discredit after a single seminar. Too much political debate centres on the number of police in London rather than what they actually do. How about a London mayor who broke that mould? He or she could start by insisting that all police activity foster the most precious crime-fighting resource of all \u2013 the trust and support of the public, especially those who live in high crime areas. Good policing must be cherished, but the other type is unacceptable. The still emerging scandals about the Met's relationships with some in the media haven't helped to foster faith. Some honest talk about crime statistics might be welcome too, not least a recognition that although recorded crime in general has been in overall decline in London for 10 years, some kinds are on the rise in a city in which too many people have become isolated from the mainstream London story of growth, glory and prosperity and that this threatens the city's whole future. Last summer's riots brought the ugliest consequences of that isolation into the light. As the Met commissioner himself acknowledges, you can't change that only by throwing uniforms at it. (This is especially true of violent, territorial youth crime, which will be the subject of a separate article next week). Liberal Democrat candidate Brian Paddick, a former senior Met officer, envisages stop and search being used far more carefully and police and local communities working together much more closely. Is he right? How would this succeed in practice? London's mayors can go out on a limb, kicking off big public debates about difficult crime issues. How about exploring the case for a clear-eyed, pragmatic legalisation of drugs? How can the law best protect those working in London's sex trade? Should we liberalise or should we criminalise the purchaser? There are basic questions about the use of resources. Paddick says that there are too many specialist units in the Met at the expensive of regular, response policing. Is he right? Bernard Hogan-Howe has launched a campaign against uninsured motorists. Should the mayor ask him to go further? And, by the way, is it logical that the City of London has a police service all of its own? Those are just few questions I'd like your help with answering. You, I'm sure, will raise other issues. Please, be my guest. AnUncivilServant suggests: Without question the MPS needs to be stripped of its national responsibilities for counter terrorism and this shifted elsewhere (the new National Policing Service being the obvious option). That way the MPS can focus on the job of protecting the capital. This would also mean that there would no longer be any need for the Home Secretary to be involved in the decision of appointing the Commissioner - meaning that the Mayor can pick the right candidate for London. It's unfortunate but I think the MPS's share of the precept also needs to go up. We have the lowest level of police officers per capita since the advent of modern policing and while keeping the capital safe isn't merely a numbers game, more bodies wouldn't hurt. It's become clear that there is an urgent need to knock Kit Malthouse off his perch as well. Not only is he a part timer but his predilection for meddling in operational matters are putting the Met's independence at risk. I'm in favour of more accountability for the police but the elected head in London should be the Mayor and no one else. My other proposals would be: 1. The Safer Neighbourhood teams need their sergeants back - the ones that Boris took away. 2. An increase in resources for rape - the MPS has one of the worst force area records in this area 3. Abolition of the City of London force and a merger with the MPS. It's national responsibilities for financial crime should be transferred to the new National Policing Service 4. A revision of the requirements for entry to the Met - higher educational standards would (I hope) get a better type of applicant and this should be coupled with mores stringent criteria for promotion. All applicants for senior positions should be required to be educated to degree level - not currently the case. 5. the territorial policing model needs a review. Whether a model based on 32 boroughs is still sustainable is a moot point. I'd want to see more of a sub-regional model for policing to create flexible resourcing and give officers a broader range of experience DaveHill responds: Lots of good thoughts there, thanks. One them includes the Met's record on rape investigations. You might agree with Brian Paddick on this issue. Police are in danger of encouraging \"predatory men\" to rape women by discrediting victims in their investigations, the former senior Metropolitan police officer Brian Paddick has claimed. In a Guardian interview, Paddick warns that some detectives adopt a \"she wants it really\" attitude to women alleging rape and sometimes refuse to acknowledge that some types of men, such as licensed cab drivers, can be rapists. Full story here. Greatunclefred suggests: Glad the new Commissioner is getting illegal vehicles off our streets. Jenny Jones has been a fairly lone voice at times, saying that this is a priority because of the link to both mainstream crime and hit &amp; run incidents. DaveHill responds: Agreed. westwoods suggests: Oh please. Last summer's riots brought the vile, criminal element out onto our streets to loot, assault and commit arson. Most honest, law abiding people would have been happy to see troops deployed. DaveHill responds: Have I disagreed? Trouble is, the world's not simple. P0kerFace suggests: I'd like to see a mayor point out that \"police on the beat\" is simply cops walking down the street giving directions to tourists, and it is also reported crimes going uninvestigated. Why such focus on this pointless rhetoric? For that matter, police on the beat could cover a lot more high streets on the back of a bicycle. Expand the police cycle task force. On drugs - Legalise, tax, regulate. The war on drugs doesn't work, just take a look at the greater harm the american/mexican war on drugs has had. Stop wasting taxpayer money criminalising those who fall victim to drug addiction. Take back power from drug cartels by having regulated, legal institutions take over the distribution. Use the money gained through tax to fund rehabilitation and support centers for those who suffer addictions. Prositution - If you're good at math but not good at sex, you use your trade to get money for other things, but you can't trade it for sex. If you're good at sex but not good at math, you can't trade your skill for anything. I'll never understand why the math group can't trade for sex and the sex group can't trade for money. Take money and power back from criminal groups who take advantage of the industries illegal status, reduce human trafficking, register and protect those in the industry, use the tax benefits to fund programmes that further reduce human trafficking. DaveHill responds: Hi. I think you're on to something with this: \"I'd like to see a mayor point out that \"police on the beat\" is simply cops walking down the street giving directions to tourists, and it is also reported crimes going uninvestigated. Why such focus on this pointless rhetoric?\" A recent LSE study concluded that a 10% increase in police activity on the streets produces a 3% decrease in crime. I think there's a good argument for visible policing, but do those stats represent the best use of resources? Do we still over-romanticise the bobby on the beat? Some people think both Ken and Boris guilty of that. david119 suggests: I used to be very proud of our largely unarmed British Police. But over the years they have become increasingly militaristic, arrogant, overbearing and completely out of touch with the needs of ordinary people. DaveHill responds: I don't think you're alone in that - even Kit Malthouse wouldn't entirely demur - although I still believe that really good cops are exceptional people. I'd like a mayor who said that loud and clear but also didn't hesitate to condemn the bad sort of policing. situgrrl suggests: The only thing I can add is that SNTs are absolutely crucial and they are NOT WORKING at the moment. I speak as a boater who lives along a towpath ridden with all sorts of low-level crime. However, the police fail to respond in a timely manner and write off crimes as they did not happen because they cannot find the towpath. (Assault in Alperton with threat of sexual violence, bicycle theft in Victoria Park, threat to burn boats in Victoria Park, burglary in Kensal Rise, bottles thrown at boats in Islington.) The control rooms rely on you being able to provide a postcode....wtf it's 999, triangulate the phone automatically. Change of culture within the police is necessary both Met/City and nationwide. Victims should not be treated as suspects, even if they have been suspected/convicted of other crime. Accountability. DaveHill responds: Good point. I know someone who lives on a boat and got burgled recently. And there are wider arguments about how SNTs are used too. For example, Brian Paddick thinks there should be more warranted officers among them in high crime areas and fewer in, say, Bromley. Not sure how the suburbs would respond to that idea, mind. bumbumbum suggests: When is the home office going to stop dreaming and pragmatically approach the issue of drug legalisation. It has worked in portugal. Why is the UK different? Do the British public have a general necessity to be nannied more than other countries? DaveHill responds: How did they go about the process in Portugal? My sense is that it would be worth it in the end, but that there would be problems too. Perhaps I'll read this properly later. Osbournecox suggests: I've got three thoughts on this: 1. Crime trends suggest that the police, for all their faults, are actually doing a pretty good job. There are some areas for improvement such as rape convictions, street prostitution and drugs, but these are hard to tackle and require expertise not mayoral pronouncements. 2. People seemed to take a real interest in the street level crime data published last year. Instead of police walking around to create perceptions of safety at great expense I would like to see them using the stats as a platform for real discussion with local communities. So both communities and police could better understand what's the problem, what's working and what both sides could do to contribute to improvements. 3. The met horse leasing scheme should be transparent and open to all. DaveHill responds: Thanks for your contributions. You might like this Paddick campaign initiative. Pagey suggests: \"A revision of the requirements for entry to the Met - higher educational standards would (I hope) get a better type of applicant and this should be coupled with mores stringent criteria for promotion.

Some fear that this will politicise policing, but Kit Malthouse, who is Boris Johnson's appointee as head of the newly formed <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/policing-and-crime/about-mopc\" title=\"\">Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime</a>, argues that the Met has always responded to the demands of politicians. Both Johnson and Ken Livingstone before him have rather borne this out.</p> <p>So the constitutional subtleties are probably less important than the mayor's priorities and determination to see them implemented. What should those priorities be? Most politicians talk utter rubbish about crime. Terrified of being dubbed \"soft\" by the media, they spout \"get tough\" platitudes that the dimmest criminology undergraduate could discredit after a single seminar. Too much political debate centres on the number of police in London rather than what they actually do. How about a London mayor who broke that mould?</p> <p>He or she could start by insisting that all police activity foster the most precious crime-fighting resource of all \u2013 the trust and support of the public, especially those who live in high crime areas. Good policing must be cherished, but the other type is unacceptable. The still emerging scandals about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/feb/28/metropolitan-police-horse-rebekah-brooks\" title=\"\">the Met's relationships with some in the media</a> haven't helped to foster faith.</p> <p>Some honest talk about crime statistics might be welcome too, not least a recognition that although recorded crime in general has been in overall decline in London for 10 years, some kinds are on the rise in a city in which too many people have become isolated from the mainstream London story of growth, glory and prosperity and that this threatens the city's whole future.</p> <p>Last summer's riots brought the ugliest consequences of that isolation into the light. As the Met commissioner himself acknowledges, you can't change that only by throwing uniforms at it. (This is especially true of violent, territorial youth crime, which will be the subject of a separate article next week). Liberal Democrat candidate Brian Paddick, a former senior Met officer, envisages <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/jan/05/brian-paddick-london-communities-policing\" title=\"\">stop and search being used far more carefully and police and local communities working together</a> much more closely. Is he right? How would this succeed in practice?</p> <p>London's mayors can go out on a limb, kicking off big public debates about difficult crime issues. How about exploring the case for a clear-eyed, pragmatic legalisation of drugs? How can the law best protect those working in London's sex trade? Should we <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/02/prostitution-legalise-criminalise-swedish-law\" title=\"\">liberalise or should we criminalise the purchaser</a>?</p> <p>There are basic questions about the use of resources. Paddick says that there are too many specialist units in the Met at the expensive of regular, response policing. Is he right? Bernard Hogan-Howe has launched a campaign against uninsured motorists. Should the mayor ask him to go further? And, by the way, is it logical that the <a href=\"http://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/citypolice/\" title=\"\">City of London has a police service</a> all of its own?</p> <p>Those are just few questions I'd like your help with answering. You, I'm sure, will raise other issues. Please, be my guest.</p> <h2><strong>AnUncivilServant suggests:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386975294\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330949856201/greyavatar-001.jpg\" alt=\"greyavatar\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">greyavatar Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without question the MPS needs to be stripped of its national responsibilities for counter terrorism and this shifted elsewhere (the new National Policing Service being the obvious option). That way the MPS can focus on the job of protecting the capital. This would also mean that there would no longer be any need for the Home Secretary to be involved in the decision of appointing the Commissioner - meaning that the Mayor can pick the right candidate for London.</p> <p>It's unfortunate but I think the MPS's share of the precept also needs to go up. We have the lowest level of police officers per capita since the advent of modern policing and while keeping the capital safe isn't merely a numbers game, more bodies wouldn't hurt.</p> <p>It's become clear that there is an urgent need to knock Kit Malthouse off his perch as well. Not only is he a part timer but his predilection for meddling in operational matters are putting the Met's independence at risk. I'm in favour of more accountability for the police but the elected head in London should be the Mayor and no one else.</p> <p>My other proposals would be:</p> <p>1. The Safer Neighbourhood teams need their sergeants back - the ones that Boris took away.<br>2. An increase in resources for rape - the MPS has one of the worst force area records in this area<br>3.

      "bodyText": "Concessions planned in the budget will cut the tax bill of some of the UK's largest companies by billions of pounds, and make it much easier for them to reduce their taxes in developing countries, according to an analysis (pdf) prepared by the NGO ActionAid. The government plans to change the rules on how foreign subsidiaries of multinationals based in the UK are taxed under so called controlled foreign company rules (CFCs), while also reducing the headline rate of corporation tax in the finance bill, which will be presented on 21 March. The Treasury's own estimate is that the CFC changes will cost the UK nearly \u00a31bn a year in lost revenue from tax on foreign subsidiaries by 2015. ActionAid estimates developing countries could lose \u00a34bn a year of tax revenue as a result. The UK corporation tax rate has already been reduced from 28% under the previous government to 26% in 2011-12 and will be brought down further until it reaches 23% from 2014-15 under measures already announced by the chancellor, George Osborne. Proposed changes in the 2012 budget to the CFC rules will exempt the profits of UK-based companies made abroad and shifted to tax havens from UK tax. Until now, the CFC rules have said that a UK-based company moving profits out of a third country, for example in Africa, to a tax haven such as Switzerland, would still be taxed on those profits at the difference between the UK rate and the tax haven rate. Aid agencies fear the changes will give multinational businesses a strong incentive to move their profits out of poorer countries into tax havens. In a further concession, the government is expected to cut the tax rate to just 5.75% on profits made by multinational companies finance subsidiaries in tax havens. This will make it attractive for companies to set up treasury companies in tax havens to finance their operations onshore through loans from offshore subsidiaries. The onshore companies then pay interest to the offshore subsidiary so that the profits are shifted away from the UK and benefit from the very attractive tax rate. The UK government argues that the measures are needed to keep its rates of corporation tax low enough to be competitive with other countries that have much lower rates than the UK. Business has lobbied extensively for the changes, with some companies threatening to relocate to other jurisdictions if they are not introduced. It disputes ActionAid's estimate of losses to developing countries and says it is impossible to quantify the impact abroad. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The government is fully committed to tackling both tax avoidance and evasion. At the last budget, we announced a package of measures closing down tax loopholes to bring in around \u00a31bn a year. The controlled foreign companies rules are designed to protect the UK tax base from artificial diversion of profits. Similarly, other countries have CFC rules that are designed to protect their local tax bases. The best way to prevent tax avoidance in developing countries is by helping them to develop robust and stable tax systems which enable them to collect the tax they are owed.\" She also said the Department for International Development and HMRC's international unit have been involved in training developing countries in strengthening their revenue collection. Martin Hearson, campaign manager at ActionAid, said that the change in UK policy would have a dramatic impact on poorer countries and their ability to raise revenue for vital services such as health and education. \"Tax policy needs to be made in consultation with everyone it affects,\" he said. \"That not only means the businesses concerned, but in this case it also includes developing countries. The government should follow the clear advice that it has received from international organisations whose opinion it respects, including the IMF and OECD, and assess the impact of any changes on poor countries before it goes ahead.\" Aid agencies, including ActionAid and Christian Aid, are calling on the government to rethink the proposals. Labour's shadow exchequer secretary, Owen Smith, also attacked the proposals. \"In last year's finance bill, Labour urged the government to provide a full impact assessment of the effect of the CFC changes on developing countries,\" he said. \"In addition to repeating this call, we shall also be asking the government for assurances that the changes won't cost jobs at home and won't facilitate tax avoidance abroad.\"",

      "body": "<p>Concessions planned in the budget will cut the tax bill of some of the UK's largest companies by billions of pounds, and make it much easier for them to reduce their taxes in developing countries, <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/doc_lib/collateral_damage.pdf\" title=\"\">according to an analysis</a> (pdf) prepared by the NGO ActionAid.</p> <p>The government <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/controlled_foreign_companies.htm\" title=\"\">plans to change the rules</a> on how foreign subsidiaries of multinationals based in the UK are taxed under so called controlled foreign company rules (CFCs), while also reducing the headline rate of corporation tax in the finance bill, which will be presented on 21 March. The Treasury's own estimate is that the CFC changes will cost the UK nearly \u00a31bn a year in lost revenue from tax on foreign subsidiaries by 2015. ActionAid estimates developing countries could lose \u00a34bn a year of tax revenue as a result.</p> <p>The UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/07/tax-city-heist-of-century\" title=\"\">corporation tax rate has already been reduced</a> from 28% under the previous government to 26% in 2011-12 and will be brought down further until it reaches 23% from 2014-15 under measures already announced by the chancellor, George Osborne.</p> <p>Proposed changes in the 2012 budget to the CFC rules will exempt the profits of UK-based companies made abroad and shifted to tax havens from UK tax. Until now, the CFC rules have said that a UK-based company moving profits out of a third country, for example in Africa, to a tax haven such as Switzerland, would still be taxed on those profits at the difference between the UK rate and the tax haven rate. Aid agencies fear the changes will give multinational businesses a strong incentive to move their profits out of poorer countries into tax havens.</p> <p>In a further concession, the government is expected to cut the tax rate to just 5.75% on profits made by multinational companies finance subsidiaries in tax havens. This will make it attractive for companies to set up treasury companies in tax havens to finance their operations onshore through loans from offshore subsidiaries. The onshore companies then pay interest to the offshore subsidiary so that the profits are shifted away from the UK and benefit from the very attractive tax rate.</p> <p>The UK government argues that the measures are needed to keep its rates of corporation tax low enough to be competitive with other countries that have much lower rates than the UK. Business has lobbied extensively for the changes, with some companies threatening to relocate to other jurisdictions if they are not introduced. It disputes ActionAid's estimate of losses to developing countries and says it is impossible to quantify the impact abroad.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The government is fully committed to tackling both tax avoidance and evasion. At the last budget, we announced a package of measures closing down tax loopholes to bring in around \u00a31bn a year. The controlled foreign companies rules are designed to protect the UK tax base from artificial diversion of profits. Similarly, other countries have CFC rules that are designed to protect their local tax bases. The best way to prevent tax avoidance in developing countries is by helping them to develop robust and stable tax systems which enable them to collect the tax they are owed.\"</p> <p>She also said the Department for International Development and HMRC's international unit have been involved in training developing countries in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/feb/29/uk-urged-support-zambia-tax-multinationals\" title=\"\">strengthening their revenue collection</a>.</p> <p>Martin Hearson, campaign manager at ActionAid, said that the change in UK policy would have a dramatic impact on poorer countries and their ability to raise revenue for vital services such as health and education. \"Tax policy needs to be made in consultation with everyone it affects,\" he said. \"That not only means the businesses concerned, but in this case it also includes developing countries. The government should follow the clear advice that it has received from international organisations whose opinion it respects, including the IMF and OECD, and assess the impact of any changes on poor countries before it goes ahead.\"</p> <p>Aid agencies, including ActionAid and Christian Aid, are calling on the government to rethink the proposals.</p> <p>Labour's shadow exchequer secretary, Owen Smith, also attacked the proposals. \"In last year's finance bill, Labour urged the government to provide a full impact assessment of the effect of the CFC changes on developing countries,\" he said. \"In addition to repeating this call, we shall also be asking the government for assurances that the changes won't cost jobs at home and won't facilitate tax avoidance abroad.\"</p>",

The actual wedding takes seconds by comparison. \u2022 Watch Now on to other business: as many Clip joint regulars have noticed, when the series made a low-key comeback a couple of weeks ago it was in a slightly scaled back format. After calling out to our followers on Twitter and Facebook for subject suggestions, we then set the ball rolling for each thread with a small selection of clips related to the topic and an invitation for readers to post more. Many of you echoed the sentiments expressed here by nilpferd: I find this new version a little underdone. There doesn't seem to be much potential for the sorts of discussions or revelations which used to make reading the thread such a pleasure. I learnt so much from Phil Hoad's original and from my fellow clip jointers' wide ranging knowledge and erudition in the follow-on version, but it was generally sparked off by teasing introductions which did a lot more than just showcase a couple of clips and leave people to get on with things. rowingrob said: I can never work out where to contribute ideas for themes and I've asked the \"reader's editor\" (twice!) and received no reply. I appreciate the need for new themes and ways of generating them but the old format seemed to attract a reasonable amount of posts each week. And monkey2 said: I would prefer the old format, as the choice of clips from the main contributor, along with the text, gives a nuanced direction as to how the substance of the topic is intended to go. This usually provides for a more fruitful selection of clips below the line which has, over these recent years, resulted in me finding so many wonderful new films to watch. Clip joint has positively improved my enjoyment of movies, has found new films and directions and has been an invaluable resource for any serious film lover. It would be a real shame for it to become watered down. How would you like us to proceed with Clip joint in future? Unfortunately we're no longer going to be commissioning above-the-line pieces, but that doesn't necessarily mean an end to the Clip joint of old. It's more a question of whether we model it on something like Readers recommend on guardian.co.uk/music, or these weekly music playlists, Comment is free's readers' panels, our own community-driven Cine-files, or some as-yet-untried approach. Regarding rowingrob's comment, should we have an ongoing open thread for topic suggestions? Or should we nominate one volunteer a week to come up with a subject?

The company issued a host of profit warnings last year - including taking a $9.5m profit hit when floods in Thailand disrupted its supply of hard-disk drives - prompting a boardroom shake-up. Allan Leighton, the former Asda and Royal Mail director who became Pace chairman in May, appointed the company's US boss Mike Pulli as chief executive in December, and things now seem to be looking up. Full year earnings fell from $160m to $141m but this was in line with previous guidance, and the company said 2012 revenues would be flat before the total cost of the disk drive disruption, put at $25m to $35m. This is lower than earlier estimates of $35m to $50m. The main effect of the disruption is expected to be felt in the first half. But the company said efficiency improvements meant it expected to achieve its target of 7% underlying margins. So it intends to pay a dividend of 3.75 cents a share, compared to 3.37 cents last year, contrary to suggestions the payout might be cut. Pace's shares have climbed 9p to 90p and analysts at Espirito Santo said: Overall, we think that this set of results should bring relief for Pace investors both on dividends as well as on the impact due to hard disc drive supply shortage. In our view the shares trade at an undemanding rating. However, post the management overhaul, we see significant short-term uncertainty. We retain our neutral recommendation. Alex Jarvis at Peel Hunt was more positive, raising his target price from 75p to 99p and issuing a buy recommendation: The 2011 results are in line and the outlook is broadly unchanged although the guidance on the impact of hard disc drive shortages is improved. This results in a 13% upgrade, taking the mid-point of both previous and current guidance.",

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong's stock exchange traders are up in arms after their lunchbreak was cut to 60 minutes \u2013 only a few years ago they could take two hours. The break arises from the complete shutdown of the exchange at lunchtime, something that is rare outside Asia. In London, the exchange is open for a full eight and a half hours. So what rights do UK workers have for rest breaks and do they take them? The Working Time Regulations 1998 entitle people to a break of 20 minutes when a day's working time is more than six hours. The right is limited to one 20 minute break a day if the shift is at least six hours, even you ultimately work say a 12-hour day. Additional breaks may be given by your contract of employment with an hour for lunch not being uncommon. While employers must ensure that workers can take their rest period or breaks, they are not required to force workers to take them. The rules also states that the break must be in one block \u2013 not, for example, two 10-minute chunks; it cannot be taken off one end of the working day \u2013 it must be somewhere in the middle and you are allowed to spend it away from the place where you work. However your employer can stipulate when it is taken, as long as it meets these conditions. The rights to breaks apply differently in some situations, such as where you constantly work in different places making it difficult to work to a set pattern or you are working in an industry with busy peak periods, like agriculture, retail or tourism. In these cases, instead of getting normal breaks, you are entitled to \"compensatory rest\", where the break is taken later, ideally during the same or following working day. If you work in air, road or sea transport you are what is known as a \"mobile worker\" for the purposes of the regulations, which means you are excluded from the usual entitlements and instead are entitled to \"adequate rest\". This is a regular rest period long enough to make sure you do not cause injury to yourself or anyone around you due to tiredness. If your employer does not allow you to take your breaks against your wishes, you can lodge a formal grievance and if necessary make a claim to the Employment Tribunal. If you belong to a union, you could contact it first. You should try to resolve the matter informally first if possible. The rules are there, but research suggests we are not taking all of the time we are entitled to. In January 2011, research by BUPA (pdf) found just three in 10 (30%) employees were taking a lunch hour. It also found that more than a third (34%) of employees experienced pressure from managers to work through their lunch hour, while half consider the weight of their workload prevents them from taking a break. According to research from Business Environment in which 3,000 office workers were surveyed, some industry sectors are more into taking lunch hours than others. For example, 38% of banking and insurance sector workers enjoyed an hour-long lunch break, while 35% of catering staff never take lunch. The impact on workers not taking a break is significant. Many studies show an overworked and stressed worker will ultimately prove unproductive and overwork could have health implications. It could also lead to negligent mistakes which could cost the employer dearly. I have seen many such cases, especially in demanding employment sectors such as the financial industry. So what's your experience of lunchbreaks? Does 60 minutes sound like a good deal or a bad one? \u2022 Philip Landau is an employment lawyer at Landau Zeffertt Weir solicitors",

GM's vice-chairman, Steve Girsky, said the world's largest automotive group would uphold a labour agreement that spares its European plants from closure before 2014, but would not be drawn on the future of Ellesmere Port \u2013 one of the factories under threat from a review of its European business. Asked to comment on the facility's long-term prospects, he said: \"Ellesmere Port has been a good plant for us in the past. They produce good product \u2026 We produce vehicles in a lot of different parts of the world. We understand we have too much capacity. We have to understand the best ways of producing product for our customers.\" Girsky was similarly non-committal at last week's New York summit with Cable, where he was joined by GM's chief executive, Dan Akerson. Cable urged GM to keep Ellesmere Port open at the meeting, one of several that senior government figures have held with the business this year. Girsky said: \"We chatted about the economic situation in Europe, we chatted about the UK, the competitiveness of the UK industry \u2026 it was very constructive.\" Asked if Cable sought assurances that Ellesmere Port would not be shut, Girsky said: \"That was his pitch.\" Repeating a mantra throughout the press briefing at GM's Opel stand at Geneva, Girsky declined to comment on specific sites and said GM looked at its manufacturing operations on a \"global basis\". Adding that GM would stick to a labour deal that limits factory closures before 2014, Girsky indicated nonetheless that there would be job losses from its European business. \"We know in the future that there may not be the same amount of people here as there are today. It is important that we create an appropriate safety net for these people \u2026 We have to make sure everybody understands the environment that we are dealing with.\" Echoing comments from the other mass-market producers in Europe, from Peugeot to Fiat and Renault, Girsky said car makers had to adapt to a \"new reality\" for a European market that would sell 12m cars this year compared with more than 14m before the credit crunch. \"We need to develop a new plan, which is being developed as we speak, for the new economic reality in Europe,\" he said. Girsky spoke as Cable attended the motor show to mark Nissan's announcement that 400 jobs would be created at its Sunderland plant by the manufacture of a new compact car, the Invitation. However, Ellesmere Port dominated the agenda as Cable indicated that the matter was now in GM's hands. Asked if GM would keep the plant open, Cable said: \"There is no value in my guessing. It is not my decision. The UK has a very, very good case and we have made a strong pitch to them.\" Cable said the government was not offering financial support to keep Ellesmere Port open and that GM had to \"make a commercial decision\". Asked about the possibility of financial support from the taxpayer, in the wake of the scrappage scheme that took the UK industry off life support in 2009, he said: \"The discussion is not taking that form. We have made a very good case to them. GM is not looking for money. The decision \u2026 will be made on commercial grounds.\" GM produces around 1.4m vehicles per year under the Opel and Vauxhall brands, the latter built at Ellesmere Port and a van plant in Luton. GM believes it is 400,000 units over capacity, which is the equivalent of two factories' worth of output \u2013 putting Ellesmere Port and Bochum in Germany in the firing line. Cable added that, GM aside, the UK car industry was entering 2012 off the back of a strong year, which included jobs and investment announcements by Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota and BMW \u2013 all of whom have stands at the glitzy Geneva show. \"You can go down the list,\" said Cable. Pointing to the Nissan job news, which was supported by \u00a39m from the government's regional growth fund, Cable said: \"You have got the sense that the automotive industry in the UK is a success story and this reinforces the confidence of the companies here.\"",

Photographs emerged showing a heavily bandaged Anwar al-Bulkimy recovering in hospital, but the politician has now been dumped by the ultra-conservative Nour party after it emerged that he was actually recovering from a nose job. The case has deeply embarrassed the second biggest party in Egypt's parliament, which had been outraged over the alleged attack and demanded an explanation from the interior minister. Speaking from his hospital bed, Bulkimy had regaled journalists and a parade of visiting politicians with details of the imaginary attack which came weeks after two other prominent Islamist figures had been the victims of genuine assaults. But on Sunday plastic surgeon Hamdy Abdel-Khalek Farag called into a television show on satellite channel al-Hayat to contradict Bulkimy's story, saying that on the day of the alleged attack, the MP had been on the operating table. Initially, the Nour party stood by its MP, but an internal investigation concluded that he had been lying and it promptly expelled him. Bulkimy has submitted his resignation from parliament, but it has yet to be accepted by the house speaker, Saad el-Katatny of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was one of the many luminaries to visit the MP in his hospital bed. Prosecutors have made an official request to the justice ministry to investigate Bulkimy for filing a false police report. He could be charged with a criminal offence once his parliamentary immunity is lifted. An election will have to be held to fill the seat vacated by the MP. Bulkimy's story was seized upon by critics of religious parties and their engagement in politics. \"These religious movements use Islam in a dangerous manner when it comes to politics,\" said Bassel Adel, a liberal MP from the Free Egyptians party. \"Because they claim to represent religion, now a connection can be made between what he did and Islam, and that is not right. Politics always taints religion.\"",

After 13 years of Labour, which left behind a broken society and ruined economy, I believe David Cameron is doing what he can in an unenviable position. He faces a toxic mixture of having to work with the Liberal Democrat front bench and fighting off a centre-left agenda that is so deeply ingrained in our mainstream media that the slightest attempts at reform are guaranteed to induce squeals of outrage from the BBC and elsewhere. However, for many Conservative activists past and present \u2013 myself included \u2013 Cameron seems all too happy in bed with the Lib Dems. Many feel that the modern Conservative party can no longer be trusted to support wealth creation and free businesses from the mindless bureaucracy and tax burdens that stand between our current situation and economic growth. The Conservative party used to be one of aspiration, now it is one of appeasement. Public services are in desperate need of reform and at the same time the British people are crying out for a referendum on Europe. Let's take this example of leftist hypocrisy: the dominant rhetoric from the liberal camp speaks about protecting the most vulnerable, yet the climate change hysteria pushed by the Liberal Democrats and the EU has not only ruined our countryside with ineffective and expensive windfarms but caused energy prices to soar. Who does this affect the most? Those on lower incomes and the elderly. Cameron appears afraid to step out of favour with his Euro-loving colleagues. He fails to see that the only way out of this recession is serious policies for growth. This government needs to slash the tax burden, which cripples individuals and businesses; it must stop submitting to the screeching hyperbole of the unions and their pilgrims, a hyperbole fuelled by self interest and fearful inertia. It must do this by making real cuts to our monstrous public spending \u2013 not slight reductions in projected spending increases. Most importantly, it must give individuals the freedom to excel. There are some Conservative policies I support wholeheartedly. Iain Duncan Smith's welfare reforms are long overdue and Michael Gove is undoubtedly doing a brilliant job in education. But the heir to Tony Blair must do more than tinker with the centre-left agenda if we are to clamber out of the hole in which Labour left us. Taking back our national sovereignty and enabling a functioning, autonomous and democratic parliament would be a rather good place to start. I joined Ukip because I believe it is the only party that truly values freedom and aspiration. Ukip is about more than independence from the EU. It is about independence from an Orwellian interventionist nanny state; it is about independence for the individual. It is the only party that believes in personal responsibility and equality of opportunity not of outcome. It is the only party that places trust in people not politicians and the bureaucratic class. Ukip is not a single-issue party. Far from it. I am writing my PhD thesis on Herbert Spencer and 19th-century libertarianism. Spencer believed that freedom and progress could only be achieved by ensuring the state remained in its proper sphere, allowing the individual the greatest personal liberty, so long as this did not infringe on the liberties of others. To me, this underlines the essential difference between the left and the right \u2013 the distinction between who is best placed to make decisions about individuals, the state or the individual themselves \u2013 and whether you believe justice is best achieved through equality of outcome or believe equality of liberty is key. For me, the answer will always be the individual and liberty \u2013 and this is why I have joined Ukip. It's time for something new. It's time for real change. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "The government has been given the green light to implement the Digital Economy Act after the final legal challenge by two internet service providers was thrown out at the court of appeal. BT and TalkTalk on Tuesday lost their appeal against last year's judicial review of the government's controversial anti-piracy legislation on all but one ground. Three senior judges at the court of appeal ruled that the government could not make ISPs pay a proportion of the case fees attached to the act. The ruling brings to an end almost two years of legal challenges against the legislation by the ISPs. The government will now be able to compel internet providers to send out warning letters to subscribers accused of illegal filesharing. Tuesday's court of appeal ruling found that the Digital Economy Act is legal and compatible with European law. Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry, welcomed the ruling, saying: \"The ISPs' failed legal challenge has meant yet another year of harm to British musicians and creators from illegal filesharing.\" BT and TalkTalk had complained that the legislation was incompatible with European law and put an unfair burden on them to pay the costs of the rights-holders' crackdown on illicit downloading. However, the court of appeal judges \u2013 Lady Justice Arden, Lord Justice Richards and Lord Justice Patten \u2013 agreed with an earlier high court ruling that the legislation is lawful. They said that ISPs will have to pay 25% of the qualifying costs incurred by media regulator Ofcom in running and setting up an appeals body for alleged illicit filesharers. They confirmed that the ISPs should pay 25% of relevant costs, which are operating fees incurred when identifying which subscribers are accused of illegal downloading. The judges overturned a previous high court ruling which said that the ISPs have to pay 25% of case fees that are charged by the proposed appeals body. Rights holders have agreed to foot 75% of the costs in each of the three fees. The court of appeal also ruled that BT and TalkTalk must pay 93% of the costs of the legal challenge, a figure understood to have run into six figures.",

      "bodyText": "On International Women's Day, Southbank Centre is throwing the largest speed mentoring event ever staged in the world (we think). Hundreds of women and girls from all walks of life are invited to come with a question or challenge they would like a female mentor to help them address. It's part of WOW \u2013 Women of the World, a festival we started last year to celebrate women's achievements and to look for solutions to the many inequalities that women still face globally. Good mentoring can play an important role. Think of it as helping women limber up, get into training, mentally and emotionally to make or seize an opportunity and use it to the best of their ability. 52% of the world's population has so much more to contribute; this is one way to remove barriers and unlock potential. There's the predictable misapprehension: that mentoring mirrors the old boys' network often accused of creating closed shops and chip-off-the-old-block favouritism? Do women's networks carry the same dangers? Possibly one day they will and it's an important to guard against this. However, the current situation for women is so far from that automatic validation and promotion, we can't let that hold us back. Women are expected to treat other women as rivals for the scarce number of top jobs made available to them on the invisible quota system otherwise known as \"how many are too many women?\" (Very few, usually). Women promoting and sponsoring other women are often seen as \"having an agenda\" and there is definite comment once the number of women in an organisation starts rising towards the 50-50 mark. Above that ratio, men can feel they are being made to work in a female-dominated culture and women can be sensitive to the accusation of creating a \"girls\" environment, caricatured as bitchy, gossipy and less business-like. Most women will tell you this isn't their experience of working alongside each other, but these prejudices can weigh on their confidence to sponsor female colleagues or seek promotion themselves. WOW's speed mentoring framework is very straightforward. Every mentee gets 15 minutes with four different mentors drawn from a wide range of professions. Journalists, geo-scientists , army colonels, directors, entrepreneurs, chief executives, DJs, architects, surgeons, barristers, and academics are amongst the 165 women who are giving their time. It's a vast and varied network of encouragement and advice for the women who turn up. Like speed dating, it's fun, social and stimulating and with the same possibility of building unexpected friendships, professional networks and lasting relationships. And, like speed dating, it could have a life changing effect. Younger women will meet leaders who can be tough but supportive, can tease and be teased, can help somebody through some really knotty problems and are prepared to admit that there's no such place as a nirvana where experienced women sail on constantly smooth waters. But speed mentoring, like anything done at speed, only skates across the surface, and it can't deal with the complex and detailed issues that can sometimes blot out all hope of personal progress. To address such issues we have set up a scheme called Cascade Mentoring. Many young women will find they're not alone in the problems they face. Sharing them with others in similar situations and with a woman mentor who is prepared to be equally frank and open about her own hopes, fears and experiences can be enormously encouraging and enlightening. These sessions create peer to peer support and comradeship. Younger women discover their aspirations are being taken seriously and their doubts, dilemmas and conflicts around work and life are recognised. They lose that sense of isolation and get a reality check on problems they might have assumed to be their fault rather than the stuff of office politics or personalities and power clashes. Just as important is facing up to instances of bullying, marginalisation, and casual sexism, which women are surprisingly reluctant to acknowledge. They tend to blame themselves first, which is debilitating and undermining. Group mentoring sessions are full of humour, directness and tenderness. And why not? The 'cascade' effect comes from enabling the original mentees to become mentors themselves. Some now lead sessions helping the next generation. And so the knowledge cascades. We're hoping the symbolism, practicality and fun of mentoring will reinforce the message that women can do a great deal of good for each other and offer real support in climbing the ladder, the greasy pole or staircase to the boardroom \u2013 or wherever they want to go. However, although we want to encourage hundreds of women to engage with both schemes as mentors or mentees, there's a fundamental fact that cannot be overlooked. Women can be over mentored and under sponsored. In other words, unless women get a chance to put advice into action, all this could feel like motherhood and apple pie. We learn by doing. We can give all the advice in the world, but in the end, what helps a woman move forward is a real opportunity, a real job and real promotion. Come and join in.

A revised deal announced by CSC will see the US-based firm deliver additional implementations of the Lorenzo electronic patient records system beyond the 10 have already been rolled out, with \"options for more where demand materialises\". It has not announced how many extra trusts will take Lorenzo, but according to CSC, they are expected to be named within six months. The DH has said that trusts will decide locally whether they adopt Lorenzo or not. \"The agreement we have negotiated gives choice to trusts about taking this software, rather than imposing the decision on NHS organisations. This is in line with the government's overall approach to the NHS,\" a spokesman for the department said. CSC said it has signed a non-binding letter of intent with the department, under which the pair have agreed to a \"set of high level principles\" that are expected to become part of a binding framework before the end of the month. \"The letter of intent provides for an interim Lorenzo related standstill arrangement and contemplates that a mutual release of all accrued claims with respect to the Lorenzo deployments will be included as part of the interim agreement,\" CSC said in a filing made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the agreement. In an SEC filing made late last year, CSC said it expected to have to write off $1.5bn as a result of its Lorenzo work, effectively leaving the company with no profit on the deal. Should the agreement announced this week go ahead, that situation could change. \"Based on the terms of the letter of intent, it is reasonably possible that the interim agreement and the amendment, if concluded, could result in a payment for the recovery of a portion of the amounts that have been written off as of December 30, 2011, and therefore could generate a gain,\" CSC's filing said. CSC was contracted to deliver electronic patient record systems under the National Programme for IT. The Lorenzo software, developed by iSoft and later bought by CSC, was intended to be rolled out to trusts in the north, Midlands and east of England. The DH decided to renegotiate its contract with CSC last year, reducing the scope and value of the deal after the roll out of Lorenzo ran years behind schedule. However, the then DH chief information officer Christine Connelly warned that cancelling the contract could cost the NHS more than the \u00a31.3bn value of the deal.

Social business initiative: Call for applications The European Commission issued a call for applications, on 5 March, aimed at setting up an expert group on social entrepreneurship. This group, which will be set up for six years (2012-2017), will have the task of following up on the development and implementation of the 11 key actions of the social business initiatives (SBI).

In its internal document Cuts to the Third Sector: What Can We Learn from Transition Fund Applications?, which was leaked to shadow minister for civil society Gareth Thomas, the umbrella body analyses applications to the government Fund. It reports that cuts to the charity sector in the UK in 2011/12 will range from \"just under \u00a31bn (\u00a3970m) in the very best case scenario, to just over \u00a35.5bn (\u00a35,556.9m) in the very worst case scenario.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Hoketsu was the oldest Olympian at the last Games in Beijing and will be 71 by the time the London Games come around, increasing the record he set in 2008 for being the oldest Japanese Olympics competitor ever at 67 years and four months. Azusa Kitano, a spokeswoman for the Japanese Equestrian Association (JEF), said: \"We will make a formal decision on his selection as soon as possible. I understand he is willing to go.\" If selected for the Japanese equestrian team it will be the third Olympics Hoketsu has entered. In the 1964 Tokyo Olympics he came 40th in the showjumping event, while four years ago in Beijing he was part of the team that finished ninth. In the individual dressage competition he placed 35th. Hoketsu also travelled to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics as a substitute, but did not take part, while at the 1988 Seoul Games his horse had quarantine issues and he was forced to retire. The oldest Olympian in history was the Swedish marksman Oscar Swahn, who won a silver shooting medal 88 years ago during the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp. He was 72 years and 10 months old.

It is written by Teodora Beleaga, a City University London MA student [full disclosure: I teach at City]. Her chapter is entitled \"Hacking our future: what are trainee journalists to learn from the hackgate saga?\" She begins with a depressing picture of the reality facing \"wannabe journalists\" by pointing to the \"sleepless nights, bullying, low pay, scarce jobs, dark arts, social disregard\". But she goes on to say that trainees she has interviewed include among their reasons for studying journalism \"a moral duty to report on wrongdoings and a genuine enjoyment of being at the forefront of handling raw information.\" She contends that the real problem for these would-be journalists centres on ethics, due to \"discrepancies between what we are taught, what we learn though work experience and what we read... what are we, as prospective journalists, to make of ethics?\" She continues: \"What does it all mean, if anything? For both academia and the industry have clearly agreed to disagree here, particularly on the definition of 'the public interest'. As Nick Davies said in his testimony to the Leveson inquiry,'We don't know quite where the lines are supposed to lie. Different journalists have different definitions of the public interest'... This is why media ethics need to be discussed in the much larger context of current developments within the industry. On the one hand, they need to take account of the issues concerning both the existing and emerging business models, as well as their short and long-term sustainability, and the economical, social, cultural and political factors impacting on media standards. On the other hand, the craft of journalism is technically evolving at a high speed; networked journalism, participatory journalism, alternative journalism, citizen journalism all come with new skills to master, new tools and devices and software to learn and play with. But how are we to perform any of the new journalisms without a clear and clean ethical basis that is not only acknowledged, but also abided by across the board? In a recent debate at City University... on the hackgate controversy, we were challenged as to whether we would ever agree to using information acquired through hacking phones. Amongst the many wannabes, less than a handful said they would categorically not resort to hacking or any other dark arts. Now, what does that tell us about the future of journalism in this country?\" Beleaga moves on to discuss the use of \"dark arts\" in relation to a \"trainee journalist who admits to having resorted to subterfuge while on work experience in Vietnam.\" This person told her: \"If, in a newsroom, someone asks me to do something morally questionable, I would have to think carefully about it because now I have much more awareness of the dark side of journalism. But if it's something that I believe the public has a right to know or should know, I would not have much compunction about using a less-than-honest approach to get the information I needed to make a case. But it would have to be something pretty important and I would always seek advice from my supervisor and take legal advice as well.\" Tomorrow: Kevin Marsh, former executive editor of the BBC's college of journalism, wonders whether Leveson will offer a new way forward *The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis",

For both academia and the industry have clearly agreed to disagree here, particularly on the definition of 'the public interest'.</p> <p>As Nick Davies said in his testimony to the Leveson inquiry,'We don't know quite where the lines are supposed to lie. Different journalists have different definitions of the public interest'...</p> <p>This is why media ethics need to be discussed in the much larger context of current developments within the industry. On the one hand, they need to take account of the issues concerning both the existing and emerging business models, as well as their short and long-term sustainability, and the economical, social, cultural and political factors impacting on media standards.</p> <p>On the other hand, the craft of journalism is technically evolving at a high speed; networked journalism, participatory journalism, alternative journalism, citizen journalism all come with new skills to master, new tools and devices and software to learn and play with. </p> <p>But how are we to perform any of the new journalisms without a clear and clean ethical basis that is not only acknowledged, but also abided by across the board?</p> <p>In a recent debate at City University... on the hackgate controversy, we were challenged as to whether we would ever agree to using information acquired through hacking phones. </p> <p>Amongst the many wannabes, less than a handful said they would categorically not resort to hacking or any other dark arts. Now, what does that tell us about the future of journalism in this country?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Beleaga moves on to discuss the use of \"dark arts\" in relation to a \"trainee journalist who admits to having resorted to subterfuge while on work experience in Vietnam.\" This person told her: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"If, in a newsroom, someone asks me to do something morally questionable, I would have to think carefully about it<br>because now I have much more awareness of the dark side of journalism. </p> <p>But if it's something that I believe the public has a right to know or should know, I would not have much compunction about using a less-than-honest approach to get the information I needed to make a case. </p> <p>But it would have to be something pretty important and I would always seek advice from my supervisor and take legal advice as well.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> <strong>Kevin Marsh</strong>, former executive editor of the BBC's college of journalism, wonders whether Leveson will offer a new way forward</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis</p>",

Four trains were cancelled on Tuesday morning: one London-Paris service, one London-Brussels, one Brussels-London and one Paris-London. On Monday night thousands of Eurostar customers were held in trains for hours as the cross-Channel service suffered cancellations and severe delays due to emergency repair works. Eurostar said the disruption, which affected customers including designers and models making their way to Paris fashion week, was caused by a power cable failing on the French side of the track. Dozens of international trains had to be diverted from their high-speed line on to regular branch lines for safety as the power company EDF made emergency repairs to the broken cable. Therese Kelly, who was stuck for eight hours, told the BBC: \"We had no announcements about why the train was so delayed or why it kept stopping. The train didn't move for hours. The whole train journey was brutal, totally brutal.\" Model Laura Bailey, a face of Marks &amp; Spencer, tweeted: \"Eurostar rage more civilised than easyJet rage, but only just. #fashionablylate?\" Ryan Armstrong, who was travelling to Amsterdam via London, said he missed his connecting flight because of the delays. He said: \"We were basically on the train for nine hours. We hardly moved. There was a lot of standing still. At one point the power was cut so we couldn't see anything or get any information.\" After cancellations on Monday night, a further four trains were cancelled on Tuesday morning, including the 9:12 from London to Paris. Eurostar apologised for the severe delays but said the problem was \"out of its control\" as the broken power cable was not part of its train service but belonged to EDF. A spokesperson said the re-routing of trains off the high-speed line caused a backlog of Eurostar trains but that, aside from the morning cancellations, all services had returned to normal. \"We were always going to get people to where they wanted to be. But the speed at which this happened was controlled by how quickly we get the backlog moving again,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has confirmed that the Liberal Democrats are ready to scrap the 50p top rate of tax in exchange for a new tax on multimillion-pound properties. His party leader, Nick Clegg, has opposed calls for the abolition of the top rate of tax, but Cable indicated there was a deal to be done in the runup to the budget amid pressure on the chancellor, George Osborne, from the business lobby and fellow Conservatives to scrap the measure. The business secretary stepped up the pressure on Osborne as he became the first cabinet minister to confirm there was a \"very broad understanding\" in the coalition of a reciprocal deal that would see the tax shift from income to wealth. The Lib Dem minister also signalled that new higher rates of council tax bands could be the levy of choice. He said a possible tradeoff for ditching the top rate of tax was just one part of a \"complex set of negotiations which my colleagues are conducting\". The Lib Dems have campaigned for a \"mansion tax\" on properties worth more than \u00a32m, to pay for the poorest workers to be lifted out of the tax system. Cable told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If the 50p rate were to go \u2013 and I and my colleagues are not ideologically wedded to the 50p tax rate \u2013 if that were to go, it should be replaced by taxation of wealth, because the wealthy people of the country have got to pay their share, particularly at a time of economic difficulty. \"How exactly that is configured is a detailed matter for negotiation, but that principle must be upheld, and the mansion tax is actually a very economically sensible way of doing it. But there are different ways of approaching it.\" Cable did not rule out new, higher council tax bands on multimillion-pound properties. \"There are vast numbers of extraordinarily valuable properties now around the south of England netting very large gains for their owners \u2013 many of whom come from abroad, incidentally \u2013 and it's not taxed at all,\" he said. \"Basically, you get people with multimillion-pound properties paying exactly the same council tax as somebody in a three-bedroom semi. So the system doesn't work.\" Cable said the Lib Dems were also emphasising in negotiations the importance of lifting low earners out of tax altogether \u2013 one of the party's key themes. \"We are making progress with that,\" he said. \"That's certainly an important part of the mix as well.\" Jeremy Browne, the Lib Dem foreign spokesman, signalled over the weekend that the Lib Dems were not \"ideologically wedded\" to the 50p rate of income tax. But Boris Johnson, the Conservative London mayor, who has repeatedly called for the 50p rate to be scrapped, balked at the idea of a mansion tax. He said he was under the impression that there was \"no agreement in the coalition\". Johnson said on Sunday: \"Obviously, in a city like London \u2026 you're going to find many more people who might be hit by such a tax. I'd much rather that we stop focusing so much on bashing people and started thinking what we can do to help people into work.\" A London Tory MP echoed Johnson's concerns, claiming that the tax would hit London the hardest and hurt middle-class families. Writing in the Evening Standard, Malcolm Rifkind, Conservative MP for Kensington and Chelsea, said 81% of properties affected would be in London, half of which are in his constituency backyard. He said the levy would be \"arbitrary, disproportionate and unfair\" and declared himself \"resolutely opposed to such a tax\". Many homes costing more than \u00a32m are \"fairly ordinary townhouses\", he wrote. \"Such a wealth tax would target not mansions but desirable locations,\" he said, adding that it would affect people with \"comfortable but not wealthy middle-class incomes\", many of whom had bought their homes prior to the \"explosion in house prices\". It would be \"extraordinary\" if a Conservative-led government incorporated such a levy into the tax structure, he said. \"If we are to target the super rich for taxation, the least we can do is ensure that carelessness doesn't leave middle-class families in the crossfire. Failure to do so could force hard-working Londoners out of homes they have lived in for decades.\"",

      "bodyText": "With Michael Gove's announcement that headteachers should be allowed greater freedom in setting homework, I wanted to share some experiments I've been carrying out over the past few months. I think that homework has become a bit like drinking tea \u2013 most of us do it, we think it is good for us but we cannot really articulate how or why? So, this year I have been asking some questions that have not been asked for a while (if ever) and I have been experimenting with the homework I set. I asked staff, students and parents about homework and I hope to return to this in more detail in a later post \u2013 except to say that the very act of asking the questions provoked a strange response from many, precisely because it had never been discussed before. The experiments have also produced some interesting results and it is these that I would like to share with you here. Experiment 1 \u2013 Homework that engages them with a real purpose I offered my Year 9 thinking skills groups a deal. The deal was simple; everybody was to complete the homework on time and to my specification in order to have no more homework in that subject for that term. The assignment itself was to help me with my research about homework by writing about their views on it and researching how other schools in the world approach the issue. The response was impressive. Across the whole year group only a handful did not complete the task on time and in all but two of these cases there were extenuating circumstances. The ideas and views put forward were, as you would expect, a variety of straight forward moaning to elaborate \"blue-sky\" thinking but there was a real engagement and students were talking about it around the school. Several students not known for their work ethic handed in their work early. Perhaps this overwhelmingly positive response was due to the incentive on offer but I think that it was also due to the \"real life\" nature of contributing to my research and potentially shaping future school policy. Experiments 2 and 3 \u2013 History reading homework and using Posterous to share and feedback Lots of parents had been complaining about a lack of homework or about a lack of clarity in students recording homework. At the same time I had started working on whole school literacy and initially wanted to focus upon raising the profile of reading. So with these two factors in mind I set my amazing Year 7 history group a reading homework via our new class blog on Posterous. The blog means that staff, students and very importantly, parents can see what was set, when it was set and when it is due (and potentially contain links to sites to support differentiated learning). It also engages some learners who might not have been if we had simply written the homework. The homework was set before Christmas and was to last until February half term. Students had to a pick a book that they could link to history and then read it. They then had to create something based upon what they had read and finally they had to give each other feedback on what they had done. The results were mixed, as you would expect and I have learned from this for next time. I chose almost complete freedom over structure and whilst many flourished a few really struggled. However, I have never had such an impressive reaction to a homework and the students are engaged in history in a very personal and creative way. At the time of writing, the site (including animation, a model of Auschwitz and a mechanical cuckoo clock amongst other great works) has been viewed nearly 1000 times and the students have received feedback from TAs and teachers as well as me and their peers. I'm sure they would love to hear your views too. Here are my homework ideas on the Guardian Teacher Network.

      "body": "<p>With Michael Gove's announcement that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/04/homework-guidelines-scrapped\" title=\"headteachers should be allowed greater freedom in setting homework\">headteachers should be allowed greater freedom in setting homework</a>, I wanted to share some experiments I've been carrying out over the past few months.</p> <p>I think that homework has become a bit like drinking tea \u2013 most of us do it, we think it is good for us but we cannot really articulate how or why?</p> <p>So, this year I have been asking some questions that have not been asked for a while (if ever) and I have been experimenting with the homework I set.</p> <p>I asked staff, students and parents about homework and I hope to return to this in more detail in a later post \u2013 except to say that the very act of asking the questions provoked a strange response from many, precisely because it had never been discussed before.</p> <p>The experiments have also produced some interesting results and it is these that I would like to share with you here.</p> <h2>Experiment 1 \u2013 Homework that engages them with a real purpose</h2> <p>I offered my Year 9 thinking skills groups a deal. The deal was simple; everybody was to complete the homework on time and to my specification in order to have no more homework in that subject for that term. The assignment itself was to help me with my research about homework by writing about their views on it and researching how other schools in the world approach the issue.</p> <p>The response was impressive. Across the whole year group only a handful did not complete the task on time and in all but two of these cases there were extenuating circumstances. The ideas and views put forward were, as you would expect, a variety of straight forward moaning to elaborate \"blue-sky\" thinking but there was a real engagement and students were talking about it around the school. Several students not known for their work ethic handed in their work early.</p> <p>Perhaps this overwhelmingly positive response was due to the incentive on offer but I think that it was also due to the \"real life\" nature of contributing to my research and potentially shaping future school policy.</p> <h2>Experiments 2 and 3 \u2013 History reading homework and using Posterous to share and feedback</h2> <p>Lots of parents had been complaining about a lack of homework or about a lack of clarity in students recording homework. At the same time I had started working on whole school literacy and initially wanted to focus upon raising the profile of reading.</p> <p>So with these two factors in mind I set my amazing Year 7 history group a reading homework via our new class blog on <a href=\"https://posterous.com/\" title=\"Posterous\">Posterous</a>.</p> <p>The blog means that staff, students and very importantly, parents can see what was set, when it was set and when it is due (and potentially contain links to sites to support differentiated learning). It also engages some learners who might not have been if we had simply written the homework.</p> <p>The homework was set before Christmas and was to last until February half term. Students had to a pick a book that they could link to history and then read it. They then had to create something based upon what they had read and finally they had to give each other feedback on what they had done.</p> <p>The results were mixed, as you would expect and I have learned from this for next time. I chose almost complete freedom over structure and whilst many flourished a few really struggled. However, I have never had such an impressive reaction to a homework and the students are engaged in history in a very personal and creative way.</p> <p>At the time of writing, the <a href=\"http://mr-spiers-year-7-history.posterous.com\" title=\"Posterous blog\">site (including animation, a model of Auschwitz and a mechanical cuckoo clock amongst other great works)</a> has been viewed nearly 1000 times and the students have received feedback from TAs and teachers as well as me and their peers. I'm sure they would love to hear your views too.</p> <p>Here are my <a href=\"http://teachers.theguardian.com/teacher-resources/6717/Homework-tips\" title=\"homework ideas on the Guardian Teacher Network\">homework ideas on the Guardian Teacher Network</a>.

      "bodyText": "The international target to halve the number of people who do not have access to safe drinking water has been met, five years before the 2015 deadline, the UN announced on Tuesday. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef joint monitoring programme for water supply and sanitation (JMP), between 1990 and 2010 more than 2 billion people gained access to improved drinking water sources, such as piped supplies and protected wells. Using data from household surveys and censuses, the JMP said at the end of 2010, 89% of the population \u2013 6.1 billion people \u2013 now used improved drinking water sources, 1% more than the 88% target contained in millennium development goal (MDG) number seven, set in 2000. However, in its report, Progress on drinking water and sanitation 2012 (pdf), the JMP said 11% of the world's population \u2013 783 million people \u2013 are still without access to safe water, and the MDG target to improve basic sanitation, such as access to latrines and hygienic waste collection, is still far from being met. Around 2.5 billion people still lack basic sanitation, it said. The JMP also tempered any celebrations with a warning that the data collected only measured access to improved water sources \u2013 those that adequately protect the source from outside contamination \u2013 rather than assessed the quality, or reliability of the water supply, or whether water sources were sustainable. Testing the quality of the water at a national level in all countries was too expensive and logistically difficult, said the report. \"As a result, it is likely that the number of people using safe water supplies has been overestimated.\" The report said huge regional disparities existed. Almost half of the 2 billion people who have gained access to drinking water since 1990 live in China or India. Meanwhile, many countries in Africa are not on track to meet the target by 2015, with some countries actually falling back to pre-1990 rates of coverage. More than 40% of all people globally who lack access to drinking water live in sub-Saharan Africa. There are stark variations between urban and rural areas. The report said an estimated 96% of the urban population globally has improved water supply sources, compared with 81% of the rural population. This means 653 million people in rural areas lack improved water sources. In Sierra Leone, for example, the wealthy elites of the urban population have almost universal access to decent services, compared with 10% of the poorest in rural areas. The target for sanitation is one of the MDGs that is most off-track. Globally, it is predicted that the target will not be reached until 2026. The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, called the JMP's findings \"a great achievement for the people of the world\". It is one of the first MDG targets to be met. Last month, the World Bank announced that the first MDG to cut extreme poverty by half by 2015 had been achieved by 2010. \"The successful efforts to provide greater access to drinking water are a testament to all who see the MDGs not as a dream, but as a vital tool for improving the lives of millions of the poorest people,\" said Ban Ki-moon, but he added: \"We have reached an important target, but we cannot stop here. Our next step must be to target the most difficult to reach, the poorest and the most disadvantaged people across the world. The UN general assembly has recognised drinking water and sanitation as human rights. That means we must ensure that every person has access.\" Barbara Frost, chief executive of WaterAid, welcomed the news on water access, but said the world needed to act now to improve sanitation. \"With diarrheal diseases caused by inadequate sanitation now the biggest killer of children in Africa, progress has to improve. \"The sanitation and water for all partnership needs to galvanise action in those with the power to make change happen if millions of children's lives are to be saved.\"",

Using data from household surveys and censuses, the JMP said at the end of 2010, 89% of the population \u2013 6.1 billion people \u2013 now used improved drinking water sources, 1% more than the 88% target contained in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">millennium development goal</a> (MDG) number seven, set in 2000.</p> <p>However, in its report, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/media/files/JMPreport2012.pdf\" title=\"\">Progress on drinking water and sanitation 2012</a> (pdf), the JMP said 11% of the world's population \u2013 783 million people \u2013 are still without access to safe water, and the MDG target to improve basic sanitation, such as access to latrines and hygienic waste collection, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/oct/07/sanitation-mdg-tackle-laggard-hygiene\" title=\"\">is still far from being met</a>. Around 2.5 billion people still lack basic sanitation, it said.</p> <p>The JMP also tempered any celebrations with a warning that the data collected only measured access to improved water sources \u2013 those that adequately protect the source from outside contamination \u2013 rather than assessed the quality, or reliability of the water supply, or whether water sources were sustainable.</p> <p>Testing the quality of the water at a national level in all countries was too expensive and logistically difficult, said the report. \"As a result, it is likely that the number of people using safe water supplies has been overestimated.\"</p> <p>The report said huge regional disparities existed. Almost half of the 2 billion people who have gained access to drinking water since 1990 live in China or India. Meanwhile, many countries in Africa are not on track to meet the target by 2015, with some countries actually falling back to pre-1990 rates of coverage. More than 40% of all people globally who lack access to drinking water live in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>There are stark variations between urban and rural areas. The report said an estimated 96% of the urban population globally has improved water supply sources, compared with 81% of the rural population. This means 653 million people in rural areas lack improved water sources. In Sierra Leone, for example, the wealthy elites of the urban population have almost universal access to decent services, compared with 10% of the poorest in rural areas.</p> <p>The target for sanitation is one of the MDGs that is most off-track. Globally, it is predicted that the target will not be reached until 2026.</p> <p>The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, called the JMP's findings \"a great achievement for the people of the world\". It is one of the first MDG targets to be met. Last month, the <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:23129612~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html\" title=\"\">World Bank announced that the first MDG to cut extreme poverty</a> by half by 2015 had been achieved by 2010.</p> <p>\"The successful efforts to provide greater access to drinking water are a testament to all who see the MDGs not as a dream, but as a vital tool for improving the lives of millions of the poorest people,\" said Ban Ki-moon, but he added: \"We have reached an important target, but we cannot stop here. Our next step must be to target the most difficult to reach, the poorest and the most disadvantaged people across the world. The UN general assembly has recognised drinking water and sanitation as human rights. That means we must ensure that every person has access.\"</p> <p>Barbara Frost, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/uk\" title=\"\">WaterAid</a>, welcomed the news on water access, but said the world needed to act now to improve sanitation. \"With diarrheal diseases caused by inadequate sanitation now the biggest killer of children in Africa, progress has to improve.</p> <p>\"The sanitation and water for all partnership needs to galvanise action in those with the power to make change happen if millions of children's lives are to be saved.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in satellite company Inmarsat have come down to earth despite a 10% rise in full year profits. Investors are wary about the situation with the company's US partner LightSquared, whose plans to build a new network were hit by the Federal Communications Commission said it would ban the service because of interference concerns. As a result a payment from LightSquared to Inmarsat which was due in February has not been paid, and although the two are in discussions, Inmarsat said there was no guarantee the payment - or any future payments - would be received. Much of the growth in revenues - up 20% to $1.4bn last year - was due to the LightSquared deal, the company said, so the continuing problems have pushed Inmarsat's shares 5.2p lower to 462.9p. The company's shipping business suffered during the year as customers moved to its new, lower cost, service FleetBroadband, but it has increased the number of terminals in use and average revenues are now starting to grow. Overall leading shares are lower on continuing worries about global economic growth following China cutting its forecasts and uninspiring European service sector surveys on Monday. The FTSE 100 has fallen 55.66 points to 5819.16, while the German and French markets are down more than 1%. Hargreaves Lansdown is the biggest riser in the index, up 10p to 455.3p, but it is still likely to drop out of the FTSE 100 following this week's quarterly review. Fresnillo is up 33p to \u00a318.65 after the Mexican miner said profits for the year had risen 63% to $1.54bn, boosted by rising silver prices. Defensive stocks were again in favour, with GlaxoSmithKline up 8.5p to 1412.5p, AstraZeneca adding 15.5p to 2856.5p and Shire - recently tipped once more as a possible bid target - up 3p to \u00a322.20. Cape is topping the FTSE 250 risers, up 14.7p to 444.1p after the industrial services group issued an upbeat outlook statement despite flat full year profits of \u00a369.4m. Both JP Morgan Cazenove and WH Ireland raised their target prices. Among the fallers, insurer Aviva is down 11.9p at 355.5p following analysts at Exane BNP Paribas moving their recommendation from neutral to underperform. Ahead of results on Thursday, Exane's Andy Hughes said: We have long seen Aviva as cheap but leveraged, but with the earnings power to pay down the high level of debt. We have changed our view on the group's earnings power. In the current low-yield, low-growth environment Aviva's earnings will be lower and cash flows under pressure. Declining earnings put more pressure on the group to further reduce debt leverage, in our opinion. In the meantime, Aviva's share price has re-rated based on the recovery in Italian government bonds over the last three months. Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide has fallen 2.16p to 31.3p on doubts about whether Vodafone would end up bidding for the business, although India's Tata is still in the frame. Lower down the market Gulf Keystone Petroleum fell 27p to 312p in the wake of HSBC starting coverage on Monday with an underweight rating and 280p price target.",

In the 1920s, having already made her name as a novelist, essayist and journalist, she wrote a play and sent it to theatre managers. After 14 copies were \"lost\" (three of them by the then manager of the Birmingham Rep), she gave up. How, I wonder, would she have responded to the statistics compiled by Sphinx Theatre Company showing that women \u2013 52% of the population \u2013 make up just 35% of actors, 17% of theatre writers, 23% of theatre directors and 9% of film directors? Probably in much the same way as the hundred-odd writers, directors, actors, administrators, producers (male as well as female) who came from all points of the compass to Sphinx's third Vamps, Vixens and Feminists gender equality conference, held at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds on 3 March \u2013 with a mixture of humour, common sense and determination to change things for the better. \"Women are the backbone of protest,\" said Bidisha, summing up the day's discussions around issues of gender inequality across the performing arts. When a corporation as large as the BBC agrees that there is something wrong with its negative portrayal of women over 40 (after Miriam O'Reilly won her ageism claim in January), she continued, then it is clear that the power of critical voices, unified in protest, can no longer be ignored. \"Something,\" said Bidisha, \"has changed.\" Sphinx's artistic director, Sue Parrish, picked up this point in a conversation over coffee afterwards. \"Yes, there were moments in the 70s, 80s and 90s when it seemed as if things would change \u2013 and then those moments passed.

      "bodyText": "There was a time when university was valued as much as a 'life experience' and part of growing up as it was as a route to employment. When fewer people attended university, there wasn't a question over employability; achieving any degree would automatically place you among the most educated in the country. But with more and more young people going to university and now the introduction of higher fees to maintain this level of attendance, employability has come to the fore. Students must now graduate with not only an academic education but also the skills needed in the workplace and preferably a well-developed CV and list of professional contacts to boot. Starting on the career ladder Research commissioned by Cardiff University reveals the increased focus students are placing on their career before they even start university, when compared to previous generations. For example, employability skills are twice as important to students today as in the past, with almost two thirds (59%) of those applying to university this year saying this is a key consideration for them. Becoming attractive to employers is also twice as important to today's students as nightlife and lifestyle (30%) showing that partying has also moved down the agenda for many. Interestingly, our career service has seen numbers on its career management courses rise by a fifth as students swot up on the best way to find a graduate job. This trend is also borne out in the increased focus on work experience, which now plays a huge part in student life. With such fierce competition for graduate jobs and ever more employers telling us they won't consider anybody who hasn't done work experience, students are quite right to make this an increased focus of their time at university. Our survey findings show that two thirds (61%) of students do a work placement before starting university and the rest have done so by the end of their first year of studying. This compares to over a third (38%) of previous generations of graduates who didn't do work experience until they had graduated. We see more and more students focus on building up a healthy CV and contacts book as soon as they start their course, if not before, too. Tellingly, more than a third (34%) of those applying this year are already thinking about which skills and experience they can include on their CV, whether that is on-the-job or involvement in societies, sports clubs and voluntary work. We've also seen networking become de rigueur on campus, with students thinking about 'who they know' as well as 'what they know', both among their peers and in the workplace, with a view to getting a head start on their chosen career path. The importance of university choice With so much on the line, it's not surprising that today's prospective students take selecting their university extremely seriously. We saw record numbers at our 2011 Visit Day and our findings show that this year's applicants have visited more universities before applying than any applicants before them. More than half (52%) went to see at least three locations before deciding, a significant increase from past years (31%). The majority will also have their parents to convince, with almost all of those applying this year saying their parents will have a say over their decision (82%). We saw this first hand at our Visit Day with parents asking about career prospects, contact hours, investment in facilities \u2013 ie what will they get for their money. Quite naturally, parents are also concerned about the levels of debt that their children will incur and in the financial support and advice on offer. The evolution of university life In response to this demand, universities must show they can provide not just the academic aspect of higher education but also the personal and professional skills required by the workplace. At Cardiff University we have built up close relationships with top employers and professional bodies to ensure that graduates are equipped with the transferable skills, knowledge and attitudes needed after university. This will become even more important in the future. In years to come we are likely to see increased employer input into courses, more courses which offer a spell working in industry and large graduate recruiters targeting talent before they start higher education and sponsoring them through their studies. We have seen from the final UCAS application figures that against all expectations, higher fees appear not to have affected the desire of many to attend university, once population changes are accounted for. Young people understand that higher education continues to offer many lifetime benefits \u2013 and not exclusively for their career. But for the increased fees they want quality education from quality universities and the confidence that their degree represents the first step on the career ladder.

      "bodyText": "If you like beer, be happy. For real beer is suddenly making fresh inroads into restaurants. Today, the upmarket burger chain, Byron, launches a refreshed craft beer list which will include beers from breweries as diverse as Huddersfield's Magic Rock and San Diego's Stone. Pride of place will be given to Byron Pale Ale, brewed for the chain by Camden Town Brewery. Byron is not alone in its interest in innovative craft beer. From venues that blur the distinction between bar and restaurant, such as Bath Ales' new Bristol pizza joint, Beerd and London's Mason &amp; Taylor to mainstream restaurants such as Hawksmoor and Jamie Oliver's Barbecoa, it's increasingly easy to eat in places that also serve great beer. Moreover, this feels different to the restaurant world's previously tentative, sporadic engagement with beer. Now, the impetus is coming from below, from Britain's booming grassroots craft beer scene, rather from individual chefs, or from those breweries or PR firms who have traditionally sought to usher beer into restaurants. To put it bluntly, for better or worse, craft beer is cool. It has caught the imagination of tens of thousands of influential, opinion-forming 20- and 30-somethings. We live in a post-CAMRA world where beer is at its most exciting not in pubs but in a growing network of urban craft beer bars. In their enthusiasm for US and world beers, strong beers, stylistic hybrids, bottled and keg beers, these bars constitute a definitive break with traditional real ale culture. Yet, as clued-up restaurateurs try to accommodate this new audience, I'm not sure that either the beer or restaurant worlds have entirely grasped the generational shift. Talking to people in the trade recently, I have been struck by how they still prioritise the idea of making beer \"respectable\". The established approach is to push beer and food matching, elegant glassware and wine-style bottles for sharing, so that refined, gastronomic restaurants will begin to take beer more seriously. To me, that thinking is all wrong. Restaurants can't shape and control this demand. They're coming to it late. Their beer-drinking customers have already been turned on to complex, flavourful craft beers and now, naturally, they want that drinking experience when they eat out. End of story. Does beer and food matching matter? On special occasions, perhaps, but I'd argue its significance is overplayed. Most wine experts will admit that perfectly matching wine with food to produce a real epiphany, that elusive \"third taste\", is a very complex, expensive business. It's untenable day to day, and, frankly, most people don't care. They just want to drink something they like, which won't clash with their food. Generally, they can choose on their own, too. They don't need and aren't fooled by pricey recommendations. It's the same with beer. As for glassware, meh! Some beers need a bit of room to breathe and release their aromas, but, in order to enable that, almost any glass will do, from a pint-pot to a tumbler. Call me a barbarian, but in many cases, I'll happily drink from the bottle. By all means, teach staff how to store, handle and pour bottled-conditioned ales properly. That matters. But the emphasis on serving beer in \"correct\" and / or delicate glassware, seems more about trying to make beer aesthetically acceptable to fayn dayning restaurants rather than any real necessity. It seems like a distraction, an over-complication. The key battleground isn't Michelin star temples, but independents and better chains, like Byron. This is why price is crucial. On occasion, I'll pay over the odds for a rare, imported beer, but the price of UK ale in UK restaurants (typically \u00a34 to \u00a35.50; Byron's Pale Ale is \u00a34.25 for a 330ml bottle!) is counterproductive. It actually deters hopheads from having that extra fourth or fifth drink. I know all the arguments. Restaurants have to mark items up. They're trying to replicate the profit they would make from wine, on beer. Often by trying to sell each diner a smaller 330ml bottle with each course. But it's \u00a32.50 to \u00a33.50 for a pint in most real ale pubs. That is the killer comparison that most people will make, as they sit there, wondering why they are paying a fiver a pint and more in a restaurant. Still, having the option feels like progress. What about you? Do you want restaurants to stock good beer? Does it need to be matched with food? And will you want a dainty glass or will you happily neck it from the bottle?",

      "bodyText": "In order to appreciate and understand the concerns about the breeding of pedigree show dogs, we need to take a brief view of the history of the long relationship between man and dog. The domestication of the dog began possibly 15,000 years ago. The natural evolutionary process was replaced by an artificial selection that changed the genome to meet our needs. In other words, we have now been breeding dogs for thousands of years. This process has been a story of considerable success. Dogs were our very first pet, having lived with us for longer than any other domestic animal. No other animal has learned to understand and to serve the human need better than dogs. They have accompanied us to all continents. Over the centuries dogs have successfully undertaken more and more duties to serve man. Many dog \"professions\" have resulted from selective breeding for specific qualities such as guarding, hunting, herding, the pulling of sledges or loads, and many more. Only the healthiest and fittest dogs could fulfil these tasks, and it was these animals that were selected for breeding. Less than 150 years ago the first breed associations were established that bred not only working dogs, but also show dogs. Standards were written and laid down that defined exterior characteristics. Breeders then started to compete to produce dogs that conformed to these standards. Selection criteria changed from \"outstanding performance\" to \"outstanding appearance\". Unfortunately, the demand for \"good appearance\" can be accompanied by much worse health than the demand for \"good performance\". These days, short-headed breeds (eg English and French bulldogs as well as pugs) \u2013 the so called brachycephalic breeds \u2013 are under public and scientific fire. Why these lovely friendly dogs? What is so bad about breeding such cute-looking snub-nosed chaps? After all, they are old and established breeds. Brachycephalic dog skulls have been found in the ruins of Pompeii. Why all this fuss after 2,000 years? The answer is that the ridiculous demands of breeding standards and the exaggeration of certain exterior features have changed the appearance of these breeds dramatically. One demand was for a \"round\" or \"square\" head and this has been achieved in recent decades. Hearing our grandmothers read the story of Little Red Riding Hood we all know why wolves have big noses \u2013 all the better to smell you with! But the noses of wolves and dogs are not just for smell; they are an indispensable tool to control body temperature. Dogs are not able to sweat like humans or horses. They need the large mucosal surface of the nasal turbinate and a specific gland producing \"water\" in hot weather or when internal heat is produced after physical exercise. Vaporising this water on the large intranasal turbinate surface is the cooling principle; the tongue plays only a minor role in canine thermoregulation. This is the reason why dogs are obligatory nose breathers. No nose \u2013 no thermoregulation \u2013 no health \u2013 no animal welfare. After almost 150 years of the breeding of pedigree show dogs, sadly we are faced with an increased disease predisposition and a reduced lifespan in many breeds \u2013 in spite of enormously improved veterinary care. In fact, the veterinary profession is more and more involved with diagnosing and treating diseases that are a direct consequence of pedigree breeding. It is important that vets are not reduced to the repair troop of pedigree breeding. Breeders and breeding associations wanted the best but have failed too often. Selection and breeding solely for good or conspicuous looks is acceptable for roses and tulips, but not dogs. The current method of breeding show dogs without any serious physical challenge incorporated into the selection process will inevitably lead to damaged health in all show breeds. Veterinary health control and genetic tests cannot redeem the present concept of dog shows. The unique story of the relationship between dog and man is too old and too successful and the role of dogs in our modern society far too valuable to ignore the serious warning signs. A fundamental rethink in pedigree breeding of show dogs is essential in order to save many breeds. \u2022 This article was commissioned after a suggestion by TigerDunc \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 6 March 2012.

      "body": "<p>In order to appreciate and understand the <a href=\"http://www.vetsonline.com/actualites/detail/50454/bbc-receives-praise-for-second-pedigree-dogs-documentary.html\" title=\"\">concerns about the breeding of pedigree show dogs</a>, we need to take a brief view of the history of the long relationship between man and dog. The <a href=\"http://responsibledog.net/evolution_domestication.html\" title=\"\">domestication of the dog</a> began possibly 15,000 years ago. The natural evolutionary process was replaced by an artificial selection that changed the genome to meet our needs. In other words, we have now been breeding dogs for thousands of years.</p> <p>This process has been a story of considerable success. Dogs were our very first pet, having lived with us for longer than any other domestic animal. No other animal has learned to understand and to serve the human need better than dogs. They have accompanied us to all continents. Over the centuries dogs have successfully undertaken more and more duties to serve man. Many dog \"professions\" have resulted from selective breeding for specific qualities such as guarding, hunting, herding, the pulling of sledges or loads, and many more. Only the healthiest and fittest dogs could fulfil these tasks, and it was these animals that were selected for breeding.</p> <p>Less than 150 years ago the first breed associations were established that bred not only working dogs, but also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/19/animalwelfare.bbc\" title=\"\">show dogs</a>. Standards were written and laid down that defined exterior characteristics. Breeders then started to compete to produce dogs that conformed to these standards. Selection criteria changed from \"outstanding performance\" to \"outstanding appearance\". Unfortunately, the demand for \"good appearance\" can be accompanied by much worse health than the demand for \"good performance\".</p> <p>These days, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2106592/Leading-vet-calls-pugs-bulldogs-ban-pedigree-dogs-struggle-breathe.html\" title=\"\">short-headed breeds (eg English and French bulldogs as well as pugs) \u2013 the so called brachycephalic breeds \u2013 are under public and scientific fire</a>. Why these lovely friendly dogs? What is so bad about breeding such cute-looking snub-nosed chaps? After all, they are old and established breeds. Brachycephalic dog skulls have been found in the ruins of Pompeii. Why all this fuss after 2,000 years?</p> <p>The answer is that the ridiculous demands of breeding standards and the exaggeration of certain exterior features have changed the appearance of these breeds dramatically. One demand was for a \"round\" or \"square\" head and this has been achieved in recent decades. Hearing our grandmothers read the story of Little Red Riding Hood we all know why wolves have big noses \u2013 all the better to smell you with!

      "bodyText": "I'm not sure whether to be disturbed or delighted by my discovery that, as well as creating Grinches and Loraxes, Cats in Hats and Hortons, Dr Seuss also drew nudes. The late Theodor Geisel, who would have turned 108 last week, is famous for his children's books but he also, it turns out, was the author of a little-known picture book for adults: The Seven Lady Godivas. First published in 1939, the book is a \"tongue-in-cheek reworking\" of the legends of Lady Godiva and Peeping Tom, featuring seven Godiva sisters who are each engaged to a Peeping brother. When Lord Godiva dies falling from a horse, the girls \"were left with a grim obligation. Horses must be studied and charted, made safe for posterity.\" So they each set out to discover \"a new Horse Truth of benefit to all mankind\" \u2013 completely naked, of course. \"Nowhere,\" says their father, \"could there be a group of young ladies that wasted less time upon frivol and froth. No fluffy-duff primping, no feather, no fuss. They were simply themselves and chose not to disguise it.\" Take a look at some of the pictures here; they're hugely Seussian. Warm-hearted and faintly ridiculous, they're also utterly unerotic (and strangely nipple-free). Seuss knew this: \"I attempted to draw the sexiest babes I could, but they came out looking absurd,\" he said. \"I don't think I drew proper naked ladies. I think their ankles came out wrong, and things like that \u2026 Look at them \u2013 they're neuter and sexless and have no shape at all.\" The book did terribly: just 2,500 copies were sold out of a 10,000-copy print run, and when it was reissued in 1987 \"by multitudinous demand\" it flopped again. \"Apparently the reading public is not yet ready for a book of exaggerated breasts and buttocks caricatured in Dr Seuss's distinctive style,\" writes Daniel Donoghue in Lady Godiva: A Literary History of the Legend. I know what he means; Dr Seuss nudes are rather like seeing Quentin Blake or Helen Oxenbury erotica \u2013 the well-known styles of children's illustrators made adult, and thus faintly disturbing. They're also \u2013 dare I say it? \u2013 a little bit rubbish. Seuss himself gave up on adult books after this failure. \"I'd rather write for kids,\" he said. \"They're more appreciative; adults are obsolete children, and the hell with them.\" So, am I disturbed or delighted to have stumbled on this new facet to one of my favourite (because isn't he everyone's favourite?) children's authors? On the whole I think I'm going to plump for delighted \u2013 if only, as Maria Popova says here, because the pictures \"offer endearing reassurance that even genius can falter\". What a comfort to us all. Now if only I had a spare \u00a3800 to get my hands on this signed edition \u2026",

However, among the informed commentary, there are misperceptions being perpetuated by people taking it upon themselves to publicly comment on a people and a place they have never visited, and clearly know little about. We would encourage everyone, actors, musicians or otherwise, to come and visit our home in order that they can properly appreciate a matter that frequently gets overlooked \u2013 the unassailable right of a people to determine their own future, in their own home. I would like to take this opportunity to correct some common myths about our history. First, the Falkland Islands had no indigenous population prior to their settlement by our ancestors \u2013 the islands were unoccupied. Argentina claims the Falkland Islands form part of the province of Tierra del Fuego \u2013 an area that was not claimed as a part of the Republic of Argentina until after two generations of Falkland Islanders had been born and raised. There is no truth to Argentine claims that a civilian population was expelled by Britain in 1833. The people expelled were an illegal Argentine military garrison, who had arrived three months earlier. The civilian population of the islands, who had sought permission from Britain to live there, were invited to stay. All but two of them, with their partners, did so. We are not an implanted population. Our community has been formed through voluntary immigration and settlement over the course of nearly 200 years. We are a diverse society, with people from around the world having made the islands their home. The UN charter enshrines the right of all people to determine their own future, a principal known as self-determination. It is in exercising this right that we have chosen to retain our links with the UK. This fundamental right is being ignored by the Argentinian government, which is denying our right to exist as a people, and denying our right to live in our home. We are not a colony of the United Kingdom; we are a British overseas territory by choice, which is something entirely different. We are not governed by Britain, but are entirely self-governing, except for defence and foreign affairs. We democratically elect our legislative assembly members \u2013 they are chosen by the people of the Falkland Islands to represent them and to determine and administer our own policies and legislation. We are economically self-sufficient, except for the cost of defence \u2013 for which there would be no need were it not for the claim made by an aggressive neighbour. Through our own efforts, our economy allows us to enjoy excellent health services and education provision, with Falkland Islanders studying for their A-levels and degrees overseas, paid for by the Falkland Islands government. It is testament to the strong bond our young people have with their home that nearly all return on completion of their studies. The Argentinian government is claiming that the UK is exploiting the natural resources of the region; an absurd claim on a number of fronts. First, we manage our own resources. Our farming practices are largely organic, our ecotourism industry is famous across the world, our fisheries are internationally acclaimed for their responsible management and sustainability, and our developing oil industry is managed by our government and regulated to a minimum of UK North Sea standards. Our environment is very much our home, and as such we value and protect it. While the Argentinian government's calls for negotiations with the UK may seem benign, and a rational way to end the dispute, it should be noted that the Argentine constitution requires the outcome of negotiations to be nothing but full Argentine sovereignty over our home. As far as we are concerned, sovereignty is not up for discussion. On all other fronts, we want nothing more than to have a relationship of co-operation for mutual benefit, with Argentina and all of our neighbours. This has proved impossible. In 1995, we entered a joint agreement with Argentina over hydrocarbons exploration: in 2007 the Argentinian government tore this up. In 1999, the Falkland Islands signed a joint agreement with Argentina to co-operate in a number of areas, including sharing of information on joint fish stocks. Only the Falkland Islands has upheld its side of this agreement; the Argentinian government has reneged on nearly every point. More recent actions, such as attempts to ban our ships from entering South American ports; decree 256, which denies passage of vessels transiting Argentine waters; the banning of charter flights in support of our tourism industry; laws taking sanctions against companies involved in peaceful commerce in both countries, all point to a desire by Argentina to frustrate our international trade and attempt to isolate us. The Falkland Islanders are a peaceful, hard-working and resilient people. Our society is thriving and forward-looking. All we ask is to be left in peace to choose our own future, and responsibly develop our home for our children and generations to come. We would ask, particularly of those who take it upon themselves to comment from a standpoint of ignorance on our future, that our rights, and our points of view, and above all our wishes are respected and considered as enshrined in the UN charter. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "Here's one for Star Trek fans: this is the log of social enterprise, boldly going where few have gone before. According to the Plunkett Foundation, in its first review of rural social enterprise in England (also known as the Plunkett report), social enterprises are defined as \"businesses that are set up to tackle social and environmental problems\". This is an interesting conclusion in itself: the definition doesn't mention economic goals, and thereby fails to make a sustainable connection between delivering all three gains. According to Co-operatives UK, there are 489 rural co-ops in England (11% of the total). These generate a staggering annual turnover of \u00a32.98bn and, by conservative estimates, have some 90,000 members. Although these operate across virtually all areas of the co-operative economy, agriculture is the dominant sector \u2013 it has 241 co-operatives today. Other prominent co-operative services include country markets, housing developments and community-run shops. Rural social enterprises tend to trade as companies limited by guarantee, charities or community interest companies. The report notes how \"failure of the public or private sector to deliver a service is one of the main drivers for establishing a rural social enterprise\". Using local knowledge about these markets, social enterprises are reportedly thriving in areas where other business models may struggle. In this respect they tie in closely with the vision for a 'big society' and also with the coalition's policies expressed in the Localism Act, including the community right to challenge which acknowledges the potential of social enterprises to provide quality services at good value. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Plunkett also notes how volunteers are essential for most rural social enterprises as they represent an engaged and supportive community. So, for example, residents can buy shares in their local community-run shop or pub, or volunteer to staff the premises. What is impressive is the acceleration in the growth of rural social enterprises across the country, and the fact that most are profitable and growing. So what gets in the way of rural social enterprise? The first obstacle is the requirement to raise significant levels of finance for capital purchases at the outset. As Plunkett noted, this can prevent or delay rural social enterprises from starting up and, later, growing. Government regulations are also perceived as a significant barrier. On the positive side the report asserts that these enterprises are having a positive impact on the behaviour of individuals and communities. \"Social enterprises can emerge as trusted messengers able to influence positive behaviours,\" it says. There is also a clear nod to the scale of unmet need: around 400 village shops are closing per year, not to mention loss of libraries, bus routes and other essential services. Furthermore, 65% of community-owned shops serve the smallest places, with populations of under 1,000. Thorncombe community shop in Dorset, for example, was founded in 2009; it has a yearly turnover of \u00a3170,000, two part-time employees, 30 volunteers and 150 members. Meanwhile the North Harris Trust in the Western Isles has a turnover \u00a3217,000. It boasts seven staff, 436 members and 600 'friends' of the organisation. It manages one of the largest community owned estates in Scotland and aims to stem the tide of depopulation by addressing local housing need while protecting and enhancing its natural heritage: a vision for local sustainability.

      "bodyText": "Many social workers, with the imminent demise of the General Social Care Council (GSCC) and its responsibility for the current post qualifying (PQ) framework, will be looking with trepidation at the future and wondering what is going to happen about professional development. When the framework was first introduced in the 1990s and revised in 2007, social workers were mixed in their response \u2013 some welcomed it as a means to equality with other professions, while others asked why do I need to do anything else after qualification? Now with the establishment of consolidation (formerly PQ1) and newly qualified (NQSW) programmes for social workers starting out on their careers, social workers should be asking \"why should social workers not have a formal professional development framework?\" There will be one \u2013 though it will be different from before, offering a scheme that responds to changing financial times, employer pressures managing workload demands on their social workers, and social workers struggling to find time and/or opportunities to complete their PQ awards. The new continuing professional development (CPD) framework will offer a hybrid of work based learning, opportunities for academic awards and a recognition that learning can take place in a number of ways, including action learning sets, joint working, case discussions and reading. We now find ourselves in a new situation - GSCC will be transferring social work regulation to the Health Professions Council after July 2012, and re-registration will become obligatory after two (rather than three) years, based on outcomes and a portfolio of reflection on and evidence of learning, rather than on inputs and defined numbers of hours/days. The professional capabilities framework, developed by the Social Work Reform Board, and now under the custodianship of the College of Social Work, has established a professional framework that will be relevant throughout a social worker's professional career. An assessed and supported year in employment, being introduced from September 2012, should provide in the longer term (replacing the NQSW scheme) a development opportunity for all new social workers whether in adult or children's services, in local authorities or the private, voluntary or independent sector. Some social workers may however feel gloomy about how will they be able to prioritise their development needs without obvious external drivers, such as allocated funding, a tightly defined framework, professional regulatory requirements, and may be having to look at personal drivers. So why should we bother? Whose responsibility is it? Employers know that organisations that support social workers have the best staff retention rates. The employers standards and supervision framework (now hosted by the Local Government Association) promote supervision, appraisal and personal development plans and are expected to be part of inspection frameworks for agencies employing social workers. Universities played a key role in developing flexible PQ programmes designed for social workers in childcare, adults and mental health; it is imperative they continue to offer these until new opportunities are ready, work in partnership with employers and provide strong research underpinning practice relevant academic programmes in the future. There will be a future role too for the College of Social Work as it promotes excellence in social work and plans to endorse professional development opportunities. And what about professional social workers themselves? As registered social workers, we should support the notion of developing our specialist skills, knowledge, expertise and confidence in the interests of good practice for service users and carers, but we should also stand up for our profession, asserting the importance of acquiring and contributing to new knowledge and seeking out ways to develop theory and evidence-informed practice. So CPD is the responsibility of all of us involved in social work, if we want to improve social workers' capabilities, personal confidence and direction for practice and our careers. \u2022 Hilary Tompsett is a professor in the school of social work, Kingston University and St George's University of London, and vice-chair of the General Social Care Council This article is published by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "Scotland boasts the most progressive homelessness legislation in the world, yet the promise to give every unintentionally homeless person a home by the end of 2012 is only worth something if there are homes available. A lot has been said about the impact of the financial crisis on the housing market in Britain, with much of the attention on first-time buyers, struggling mortgage payers and private renters. Yet a bigger crisis was on the cards long before this recession hit as numbers of socially rented houses have fallen significantly in the past two decades leaving nearly 160,000 households on the waiting list for council housing across Scotland. Since 2001 over 115,000 socially rented homes have been lost through demolition and the right-to-buy scheme. While right-to-buy may have been partly successful in encouraging mixed tenure estates, allowing large numbers of tenants to buy their homes without investing in replacement housing has left a sizeable discrepancy between supply and demand. During the 1990s, at a time when Shelter Scotland estimated that as many as 10,000 social sector homes needed to be built to meet the growing demand, there was a dramatic reduction in the investment in social housing, and in particular council house building. Waiting lists for local authority housing in Scotland have grown by 54% since 2003 and homelessness applications have risen to around 50,000 a year. This underlines the need for effective homelessness prevention helping people to resolve their housing problems and avoid repeat homelessness. This isn't as simple as a drop in applications but the right advice and housing support in place to help people sustain their tenancies. The result is there are fewer homes available for more people. In the current financial climate and with the impact of welfare reform on household finances, many have no other option; they face treading water in temporary housing or living in unsuitable or dangerous accommodation. The Scottish government manifesto pledge to build 6,000 homes a year for the next four years now seems to have lost some of its shine as the terms \"socially rented\" and \"affordable\" are being used interchangeably. It now seems that these homes will include mid-market rent and investment in private housing models. While not unwelcome, not perhaps top of the priority list. Certainly a varied and adaptable housing sector in Scotland is vital to meet current and changing demand, but evidence shows that it is socially rented homes that people really need. \u2022 The HUGE Shelter walk fundraiser aims to cover 160 miles in five days to highlight the 160,000 people on Scottish housing waiting list Fiona King is a policy officer at Shelter Scotland This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

      "body": "<p>Scotland boasts the most progressive homelessness legislation in the world, yet the promise to give every unintentionally homeless person a home by the end of 2012 is only worth something if there are homes available.</p> <p>A lot has been said about the impact of the financial crisis on the housing market in Britain, with much of the attention on first-time buyers, struggling mortgage payers and private renters. Yet a bigger crisis was on the cards long before this recession hit as numbers of socially rented houses have fallen significantly in the past two decades leaving nearly 160,000 households on the waiting list for council housing across Scotland.</p> <p>Since 2001 over 115,000 socially rented homes have been lost through demolition and the right-to-buy scheme. While right-to-buy may have been partly successful in encouraging mixed tenure estates, allowing large numbers of tenants to buy their homes without investing in replacement housing has left a sizeable discrepancy between supply and demand.</p> <p>During the 1990s, at a time when Shelter Scotland estimated that as many as 10,000 social sector homes needed to be built to meet the growing demand, there was a dramatic reduction in the investment in social housing, and in particular council house building. Waiting lists for local authority housing in Scotland have grown by 54% since 2003 and homelessness applications have risen to around 50,000 a year. This underlines the need for effective homelessness prevention helping people to resolve their housing problems and avoid repeat homelessness. This isn't as simple as a drop in applications but the right advice and housing support in place to help people sustain their tenancies.</p> <p>The result is there are fewer homes available for more people. In the current financial climate and with the impact of welfare reform on household finances, many have no other option; they face treading water in temporary housing or living in unsuitable or dangerous accommodation.</p> <p>The Scottish government manifesto pledge to build 6,000 homes a year for the next four years now seems to have lost some of its shine as the terms \"socially rented\" and \"affordable\" are being used interchangeably. It now seems that these homes will include mid-market rent and investment in private housing models. While not unwelcome, not perhaps top of the priority list.</p> <p>Certainly a varied and adaptable housing sector in Scotland is vital to meet current and changing demand, but evidence shows that it is socially rented homes that people really need.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/huge160miles\" title=\"\">The HUGE Shelter walk</a> fundraiser aims to cover 160 miles in five days to highlight the 160,000 people on Scottish housing waiting list</p> <p><em>Fiona King is a policy officer at </em><a href=\"http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Shelter Scotland</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/housing/start.php?INTCMP=NECNETLRECT3718&amp;INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT9804\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more news, comment, analysis and the </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>latest job vacancies</strong></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "What links climate change sceptic Lord Nigel Lawson and Europe's biggest single source of carbon pollution, the Belchatow coal-fired power station in Poland? A pretty straightforward business connection, all documented on public websites and set out below, is the answer. But Lord Lawson's prompt explanation as to why this is a silly \"non-issue\" is not straightforward, in my opinion. It can be summarised as: it was all a long time ago, in a land far away and, in any case, how dare you doubt the word of a peer of the realm. I wrote back and asked why the information linking Lord Lawson to the filthy power station remains on the relevant websites, if it was such a long time ago and so far away. The response this time was silence. I also asked whether it was appropriate for climate change sceptic Professor Ian Plimer to remain on the \"academic advisory council\" of Lord Lawson's thinktank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, after his appointment as a director to a large Australian coal company? Lord Lawson replied: \"It may be that, given his new responsibilities, Professor Plimer will choose to step down; but that is a matter for him.\" Very gentlemanly, I'm sure. When I asked whether it might actually be a more of a matter for the GWPF itself, the silence remained unbroken. I asked Professor Plimer if he was going to resign - more silence - and as of today, he remains firmly in place at the GWPF. I've reproduced the full correspondence below, mainly because Lord Lawson's reply is such a fine read. But what are we to make of the links between Lord Lawson and the GWPF and fossil fuel companies? It's impossible to know, as the funders of the GWPF, are kept under a veil of secrecy. That's despite the recent surprise expressed by a judge, ruling on whether to disclose the name of a funder, that an \"educational charity\" like the GWPF claims significant influence over policymakers. It is also despite a report from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, at the University of Oxford, noting the \"particular success\" of the GWPF in getting its view across. And, finally, it is despite the former energy and climate change secretary Chris Huhne describing a report GWPF sent him as \"misinformed\", \"wrong\" and \"perverse\". That sounds like an \"education\" of which only the Heartland Institute could approve. From me to Lord Lawson. 1700, 2 February 2012. I am writing to request your clarification on two matters. 1. Your relationship to energy companies through the Central European Trust. 2. The appointment of an adviser to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Ian Plimer, to Queensland Coal Investments. On the first matter, you are listed as the chair of CET, which lists among it's clients BP Amoco, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Texaco, Total Fina Elf. You also feature on the website for CET's Polish office, which lists 10 energy and power companies including Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Plant, one of largest fossil fuel power stations in the world. You are also listed at Companies House as a director of CET, which is an active company. You also declare your CET position in your entry in the Register of Member's Interests. These links appear to constitute \"a significant interest in the energy industry\", which the GWPF has stated would rule out someone being able to make financial donations to the GWPF. Should such links also rule out a person holding the office of Chairman in the GWPF? On Channel 4 news in 2010, you stated: \"I have no links to oil companies of any kind\". Would it be wrong to state that you in fact do have links to oil companies - and energy companies - via CET? On the second matter, and for the same reason, do you think it appropriate that Ian Plimer should be a member of the GWPF academic advisory council when he was appointed as a director of a large coal company on 25 January 2012? From Lord Lawson to me. 1900, 2 February 2012. Let me reply, first, by saying that your implication that I am someone who cannot be trusted to tell the truth is one that I find deeply offensive. The facts are as follows. 1. There is no connection whatever between Central Europe Trust Co Ltd, of which I have been Chairman since 1990, and the Global Warming Policy Foundation, of which I have been Chairman since its inception in 2009. I would add that I disposed of my shareholding in Central Europe Trust Co Ltd some time back. 2. As I pointed out to John Prescott, who raised this non-issue under cover of parliamentary privilege more than two years ago, Central Europe Trust Co Ltd is an advisory firm which, over the years, has had clients in most industries, although its main focus has been telecommunications. It has not, in fact, had any oil company clients for many years now; and at the present time its only involvement in the energy industry is a very small interest in wind and other renewables in central Europe. 3. CET Polska, which was originally a subsidiary of Central Europe Trust Co Ltd, has for some years now been controlled and majority owned by its Polish partners, and the only connection between the two entities now is collaboration on an ad hoc basis. I have no financial interest in CET Polska, and am neither a Director of, nor a shareholder in, the company. 4. As with other think tanks, the Global Warming Policy Foundation is composed of its Board of Trustees and its employees, headed by its Director. The Academic Advisory Council is a group of entirely independent individuals, holding a wide range of views, one or more of whom may be asked from time to time to undertake peer review of a forthcoming GWPF publication or some similar task. Needless to say, no member of the AAC would be asked to undertake anything where there was a possible conflict of interest. It may be that, given his new responsibilities, Professor Plimer will choose to step down from our AAC; but that is a matter for him. Frrom me to Lord Lawson. 1700, 3 February 2012. Thank you very much for your response. I would be most grateful for some further clarifications. 1a. You have no shareholding in CET Co Ltd and, according to the register of members interests, receive no payment from the company. Why do you remain a director and chairman? 1b. CET Co Ltd is owned by Jersey-listed Danube Services Ltd, which is owned by JTC Securities Ltd, which is owned by JTC Management Ltd, which is owned by JTC Group Ltd, which is owned by JTC Trustees Ltd, which is owned by JTC Management Ltd. Do you have an interest in any of these companies? 2. You replied: \"[CET] has not, in fact, had any oil company clients for many years now; and at the present time its only involvement in the energy industry is a very small interest in wind and other renewables in central Europe.\" Why are the oil clients still listed but not the renewables clients? 3. You replied: \"I have no financial interest in CET Polska, and am neither a Director of, nor a shareholder in, the company.\" Why does CET Polska list you on their website as part of the \"CET team\"? 4. You replied: \"It may be that, given his new responsibilities, Professor Plimer will choose to step down from our AAC; but that is a matter for him.\" Why is the potential conflict of interests caused by Professor Plimer's new responsibilities not a matter for the GWPF? I have also emailed Professor Plimer to ask if he will be stepping down. I emailed Lord Lawson again on 9 February, asking \"Should I consider the absence of a reply to my supplementary questions as 'no comment'?\" I have yet to receive a reply. I also emailed Professor Plimer on 2 and 9 February, but have received no reply. Note: My thanks to Spinwatch for the original tip.",

      "bodyText": "The NFL's free-agency market opens for business next week and a wide array of talent is up-for-grabs. But first NFL teams had the opportunity to decide which players to keep out of that market: a record number of players - 21 - have been franchise-tagged by their teams to stop them joining rivals. The franchise tags - limited to one per team - prevents all-star players who have yet to agree to new contracts, such as New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, from becoming free agents and joining rivals. The list of players who were tied to their teams for another year by Monday's tagging deadline also includes: Atlanta Falcons cornerback Brent Grimes; defensive ends Cliff Avril of the Detroit Lions, Robert Mathis of the Indianapolis Colts and Calais Campbell of the Arizona Cardinals; Dallas Cowboys linebacker Anthony Spencer; Washington Redskins tight end Fred Davis; wide receivers Wes Welker of the New England Patriots, Dwayne Bowe of the Kansas City Chiefs and DeSean Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles,; Chicago Bears running back Matt Forte; safeties Dashon Goldson of the San Francisco 49ers, Tyvon Branch of the Oakland Raiders and Michael Griffin of the Tennessee Titans; kickers Mike Nugent, of the Cincinnati Bengals, Connor Bath of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Phil Dawson of the Cleveland Browns, Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos and Josh Scobee of the Jacksonville Jaguars; and New York Giants punter Steve Weatherford. A few players who were expected to be hot properties on the market this year have been tied down to long-term deals, as Stevie Johnson agreed to a deal with the Buffalo Bills, Jermichael Finley re-signed with the Green Bay Packers and Marshawn Lynch received a big deal from the Seattle Seahawks. Despite all of this activity, there is still an array of talented players available at the top of this year's free agent market, as well as a constant level of depth running through the group of roughly 600 players who don't have a contract. Here is a list of the top players remaining ahead of the beginning of free agency on March 13 and where they may move to. (*Restricted Free Agents are not included in this list.) 1. Carl Nicks. Offensive Guard 2011 team: New Orleans Saints. Best fit for 2012: New Orleans Saints. Strengths: In one sense the Saints are lucky, they have a flurry of the best players available in this year's free agent market. At the same time they are unlucky: they have a flurry of the best players available in this year's free agent market. Carl Nicks isn't just the best guard available this year, he is the best player available after Drew Brees was removed from the equation. Furthermore, Nicks is the best guard in football and one of the best all-around offensive linemen. Nicks, and his teammate, Jahri Evans are generally considered the best tandem in the league. Most elite NFL guards excel at run blocking but don't quite reach the same heights as a pass blocker. Nicks is one of the select few who can consistently dominate the opposition in both facets of the game. At just 26 he is about to enter his prime. Weaknesses: The biggest issue is value. Few teams invest that much in NFL guards. Guards are not valued in the same way tackles or centers are because teams can somewhat cover guards' deficiencies with help from players around them. Centers have to set protections while tackles are asked to contain the best blitzers in the league on the outside. Nicks won't see things that way and has already stated that he wants to be paid more than teammate Jahri Evans who received a $56 million deal in 2010, which is now the second highest in football at the position. Few teams will be willing to commit that much money to a guard because few teams would make use of all of Nicks' skills the way the Saints do. Most teams are either primarily running teams or passing teams. Signing for one of them wouldn't allow Nicks to completely show off his talents. 2. Mario Williams. 4-3 Defensive End 2011 team: Houston Texans. Best fit for 2012: Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals defense was ranked in the top 10 last year under defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer. Although they have an all-around team in terms of talent, they lack any marquee talent in the front seven. Adding Williams to Geno Atkins inside and potentially a fully fit Carlos Dunlap on the other side, would give the team one of the most dangerous defensive lines in football. Strengths: Williams is one of the best defensive ends in the NFL, but because of the Texans' scheme, he was asked to play linebacker last year before being injured. His strengths are such that he is suited to play with his hand in the ground on every play. At 6'6\" and 280lbs, Williams can overpower opposing tackles in one on one situations. Williams is so big that he can often still be effective when double teamed, but he is also athletic and can use his speed and agility to beat blockers. Despite playing on a poor defense for most of his career, Williams was still a productive player in Houston. Weaknesses: After being selected first overall in 2006, ahead of Reggie Bush, Williams will not be cheap despite coming off a season ended prematurely through injury. Huge expectations will come with Williams wherever he signs which doesn't afford him any opportunity to adjust to a new team or deal with any carry overs from his injury. There have been some question marks over his consistency and commitment when playing the run, but we could chalk those down to nitpicking from those who must find flaws where they often don't exist. 3. Vincent Jackson. Wide Receiver 2011 team: San Diego Chargers. Best fit for 2012: Tennessee Titans. The Titans don't know what to expect from Kenny Britt after tearing his ACL last season, while they need to build the offense for Jake Locker in the future. Locker has a huge arm, therefore bringing in Jackson, who is great at beating defenders deep. He, Nate Washington and Kenny Britt would give the Titans an offense similar to the Chargers' who love big receivers who excel deep. Strengths: Jackson's biggest strength is just that, his strength. Along with Stevie Johnson, Dez Bryant and Larry Fitzgerald, Jackson has the strongest upper body of any receiver in the NFL. Upper body strength is often overlooked because of the pass interference rules at the professional level of football, however it is vital for gaining position on the football and adjusting to make receptions in difficult situations. During his time in San Diego, Jackson may not have been the best of route runners, but he always had the ability to take the top off defenses with his speed and was almost impossible to cover with just one defender. Even with his size, he still has the speed to get downfield faster than most defensive backs. That is a vicious combination for any player to have. While solid receivers are easy enough to find, signing a receiver that changes the way opposing defenses approach the game is a huge coup. Weaknesses: Off-the-field problems are evident in Jackson's past but plenty of NFL receivers have had these sort of issues: worse is that Jackson's last problem came during a playofff run. Jackson, who is now 29, has been determined to get a big contract in free agency. Whoever lands him will need a strong coaching staff and plenty of locker-room leadership. 4. Matt Flynn. Quarterback 2011 team: Green Bay Packers. Best fit for 2012: Miami Dolphins. With Flynn's QB coach from Green Bay becoming the Miami Dolphins' head coach, you can expect the Dolphins to be high on Flynn's list of potential suitors. Given the hype surrounding Flynn, going to a team where he would have to compete for the job would likely work in his favour. Matt Moore is capable of starting for the Dolphins so Flynn would have to earn his position. Strengths: Judging Flynn isn't easy because he has only two career starts. On his first Flynn displayed none of the nerves and uncertainty that most first timers are prone to. Flynn did his best Aaron Rodgers impression showing off a strong arm, good pocket awareness and consistent accuracy. His biggest mistake that night was a rookie one when he failed to get the final play in on time with the game on the line which led to a sack. In his second start, Flynn picked apart the Detroit Lions' defense for an unbelievable 480 yards, a Green Bay Packers' record surpassing Brett Favre, Bart Starr and Aaron Rodgers. It is on those two performances that he must be judged. Weaknesses: Only as a quarterback would a player with two professional starts receive such attention in the NFL. Flynn's small sample size may be overwhelmingly impressive, but it remains a small sample. 5. Cortland Finnegan. Corner Back 2011 team: Tennessee Titans. Best fit for 2012: Tennessee Titans. Strengths: Finnegan showed last season that his talent can trump his reputation playing to a Pro Bowl level. His aggressive nature has boiled over on occasion and hurt his team with personal foul penalties, however last year he showed a previously unseen level of maturity as a team captain. Finnegan is an aggressive tackler who plays well in tight coverage or dropping into zone. As a veteran there is nothing in this league that he hasn't seen and handled. Weaknesses: He is not the biggest of corners and can be exposed against bigger receivers in jump-ball situations while his reputation around the league can see him penalized more often than other players. Signing Finnegan isn't necessarily a risk to your team chemistry, but it does bring another character into the locker-room which can cause unpredictable changes. . 6. Ben Grubbs. Offensive Guard 2011 team: Baltimore Ravens. Best fit for 2012: Seattle Seahawks. Tom Cable, the offensive line coach in Seattle, loves big grafting run blockers like Grubbs. Adding Grubbs would finish off an offensive line which has been completely rebuilt. He and Robert Gallery blowing open holes for Marshawn Lynch would be a winning formula in the NFC West. Strengths: Grubbs is one of the better run-blocking offensive linemen in the NFL. He has been a starter in Baltimore since his rookie season in 2007 and, along with Marshal Yanda, has been a big reason for Ray Rice's success with the Ravens. At 27 he has just entered his prime, he is durable, big and athletic without being a liability as a pass protector. While he may not be as good as Carl Nicks, his versatility and all-around game would make him a valuable addition to almost any NFL offensive line. Weaknesses: Grubbs will be looking for a lot of money. Despite being very good, is he elite? Grubbs is in a typical position where a player can take a lot of money to play with a lesser team. It will be difficult for a contender to sign him at a reasonable rate. 7. Marques Colston. Wide Receiver 2011 team: New Orleans Saints. Best fit for 2012: Minnesota Vikings. Colston won't get the biggest deal of the receivers in free agency this year but he could represent the best value. Many will overlook his achievements in New Orleans because of the high-powered offense which he was a part of - however he was the team's best wide receiver. Strengths: Colston is a rangy receiver with reliable speed who can beat opposing teams' best cover cornerbacks. Unlike most bigger receivers, Colston can run a variety of routes and is more of an all-around receiver than say a Dwayne Bowe or Stevie Johnson. His ability to be a possession receiver or big play option makes him invaluable to any receiver-needy offenses. He has eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in five of his first six seasons and isn't limited in the ways which he can gain separation from defenders whether it be through straight line speed or shiftiness inside. In New Orleans he showed reliable hands and a consistency in finding the endzone. Despite never starting a full season, Colston had 48 touchdown receptions for the Saints in six years. In Minnesota, alongside Percy Harvin, that streak could easily continue. Weaknesses: Much of Colston's success has come on turf in a dome. Being signed by a cold-weather team could reduce his effectiveness. Colston is not a receiver who will scare opposing defenses to the point where they send extra coverage his way. 8. LaRon Landry. Strong Safety 2011 team: Washington Redskins. Best fit for 2012: Washington Redskins. Strengths: Landry is one of those physical specimens at safety in the mould of Troy Polamalu and Adrian Wilson. His ability to cover a huge amount of ground makes him invaluable against both the run and the pass. Even when reacting to plays rather than anticipating them, Landry is able to make an impact with his presence. His potential is endless and, to an extent, untapped. Weaknesses: A combination of being injured the past two seasons and the Redskins' overall quality of defense prior to then has curtailed the impact that Landry has been able to make so far in his NFL career. Essentially you would be investing in potential opposed to performance. For this reason, he is most likely going to re-sign with the Redskins where Jim Haslett can make best use of his talents. Whether he has hurt or helped himself by bulking up so dramatically this off-season will also be a worry. 9. Brandon Carr. Cornerback 2011 team: Kansas City Chiefs. Best fit for 2012: Dallas Cowboys. Terrence Newman is expected to be a cap casualty while Orlando Scandrick remains an unproven commodity as a starter. Mike Jenkins inconsistency continued last season while the Cowboys' secondary as a whole needs to be upgraded. Carr would have been certain to return to Kansas City prior to the team signing Stanford Routt. Strengths: There is a lot of talk about Brandon Carr being a product of a system. That reference is to the fact that the Chiefs play their corners in press coverage more often than not. Finding corners good in press coverage is very difficult. He has a skill-set which is rare in today's NFL and as such, he will likely be one of the more sought-after players come free agency. Carr is not a number one corner on a good defense. However he is an above average second starter who is entering the prime of his career. Whatever team adds him will be able to get his best years out of him. Weaknesses: Before last year Carr didn't come up with many turnovers. Even last season he only had four interceptions. Because of the way he plays the game, interceptions aren't going to be a regular occurrence as he instead prevents the opposition's receivers from catching the ball. For some franchises that is a negative, however some wouldn't even call that a weakness. 10. Jared Gaither. Offensive tackle 2011 team: Oakland Raiders/Kansas City Chiefs/San Diego Chargers. Best fit for 2012: San Diego Chargers. Strengths: Last season, Gaither wasn't re-signed by the Baltimore Ravens before losing out on a roster spot in Oakland with the Raiders. He was infamously cut by the Kansas City Chiefs after false starting on one of his few snaps. He then landed with the Chargers and, statistically, was one of the best left tackles in the NFL last year. Gaither has the bulk to withstand bull rushers from bigger pass-rushers, while his nimble feet and good balance lets him keep his body between blitzers and his quarterback. He is rarely ever beaten off the snap and also excels as a run-blocker. Despite being in the NFL for a long time, he is yet to enter the prime of his career at only 25 years old. Left tackles with elite talent are not easy to find, it is why players like Joe Thomas, Jake Long and Ryan Clady were all drafted so high out of college. Picking up one with potentially his best years ahead of him, without breaking the bank, would be a huge pickup for most teams. Weaknesses: Injuries: He has suffered many of them during his NFL career including a back injury which cost him the whole of his 2010 season. When he has been on the field he has been an elite performer. Even James Harrison in his prime became a victim of Gaither's when he was in Baltimore. Very few tackles can say that. He is certainly a risk, but the possible reward is huge. 11. John Abraham. Defensive end 2011 team: Atlanta Falcons. Best fit for 2012: New Orleans Saints. At 34 years of age, Abraham needs to give himself the best opportunity to win a Super Bowl before retiring. He has been paid handsomely throughout his career as an Atlanta Falcon but it is time for him to give himself the best opportunity to win in the playoffs which he can't do in Atlanta. Abraham would be the perfect starter to take the place of Cameron Jordan while also teaching him for the future. Strengths: Abraham has been a star pass-rusher in Atlanta for years without much help. He is proven against double teams and has all the physical tools required. With 112 sacks in 12 NFL seasons, and most recently 9.5 last year, Abraham's experience is also invaluable to whatever team signs him. Despite being an older player, Abraham won't have to be a situational pass-rusher similar to Jason Taylor over the past few years. Abraham is dominant against both the run and the pass who requires double teams in order to be contained. Weaknesses: Whoever signs Abraham will have to understand that he is only a short-term option. The threat remains that he could struggle to adapt to a new team after so long with the Falcons while the risk of age getting the better of him is always a worry. Whether it was because of the lack of quality around him or not, Abraham was never really capable of taking over games against better teams in big situations. As a role player on a better team, he should flourish. 12. Stephen Tulloch. Linebacker 2011 team: Detroit Lions. Best fit for 2012: Detroit Lions. Strengths: The Lions signed Tulloch despite having a reputation for being just a tackler. In Detroit, Tulloch proved himself to be a playmaker with three sacks and two interceptions from the middle linebacker position. Tulloch is an athletic player with the ability to cover the middle of the field in the passing game as well as plug the running game. At 27 he is at the prime of his career and has a huge amount of experience with nearly 400 tackles in the last three seasons. Tulloch sweeps up attackers and is always around the football on the field. Weaknesses: Despite having 568 career tackles, Tulloch has never forced a fumble. His production last year was huge compared to the previous five seasons in Tennessee with the Titans. Prior to last season, Tulloch had one interception and 4.5 sacks. Whether last season was Tulloch's breakout year or just a one off is yet to be determined. If it is a breakout season, the ceiling isn't that high, if it's not, investing in Tulloch is a risk. 13. Curtis Lofton. Linebacker 2011 team: Atlanta Falcons. Best fit for 2012: Atlanta Falcons. Strengths: The Atlanta Falcons rush defense has been ranked in the top 10 for the past three seasons: Curtis Lofton is a big reason for that. Lofton, who has been a starter in Atlanta for four seasons, is a strong run defender with the ability to not only rack up the tackles, but also shut down runners before they even get to the line of scrimmage. He is built like a bowling ball which allows him to burst through offensive linemen to make plays all over the field. His strength and low center of gravity makes him a bullish tackler who rarely lets his target free. Weaknesses: As good as Lofton is against the run, he is a limited coverage linebacker. While dominating opposing team's running games, Lofton can often be exposed in coverage whether it be zone or man assignments. The same height that helps him shut down the running game hinders him in space with receivers and tight ends. 14. Paul Soliai. Nose tackle 2011 team: Miami Dolphins. Best fit for 2012: Kansas City Chiefs. Soliai won't be returning to Miami with the Dolphins as they transition away from the 3-4 defense. Instead, he would be a perfect fit for Kansas City who can't rely on Kelly Gregg to be the team's nose tackle next year. The Chiefs ranked 26th against the run last year, bringing in a specialist run stuffer cannot hurt them. Strengths: Soliai is a specialist run stuffer who was important enough to the Miami Dolphins' 3-4 scheme that they franchise tagged him prior to last season. At 355 lbs, he consumes a huge amount of space and has the bulk to entertain more than one gap responsibility. At 28 years old, Soliai is in his prime with plenty of quality snaps left in the tank. He is one of those players who receives no credit but goes about his job quietly and effectively. Weaknesses: As a specialist run stuffer, Soliai offers nothing in the passing game. He is a two down defender who must come out in passing situations because of his inability to move in space. He has two career sacks in five years, both coming in 2010. Soliai is great at what he does, but what he does is limited to one aspect of playing football. 15. Carlos Rogers. Cornerback 2011 team: San Francisco 49ers. Best fit for 2012: San Francisco 49ers. Strengths: Rogers was a free agent last season who didn't exactly get the big deal he was hoping for. However once signed, he proved himself worthy of big money with a stellar season. During his time in Washington, Rogers had a reputation for dropping footballs. That wasn't the case in SF last year as he showed great awareness and hands picking off six passes, returning one for a touchdown. Rogers is a solid tackler with the ability to stick to receivers. His toughness and strength is above average in comparison to most players at his position. Weaknesses: Rogers is essentially a one year wonder. He had some solid campaigns with the Redskins but never reached the levels of 2011. At 30 years of age, it is difficult to commit a lot of money to a cornerback who has only had one truly impact full season. Returning to San Francisco to familiar surroundings at least removes some of the risk of signing with another team. Which teams will invest in free agents Many teams won't have the opportunity to sign those players, but there are a few who are expected to be big spenders in free agency, much like the Philadelphia Eagles were last year. After last year's lockout, the NFL created a new collective bargaining agreement: One major difference to this agreement allows NFL teams to carry over cap room from previous seasons. While this year's cap number is as of yet unknown, last year's was $120 million. Therefore, under the new rules, teams were able to bring over whatever the difference was between their actual spending and the $120 million mark. Therefore, for a team like the Jacksonville Jaguars, who finished last season with $31 million of space, their cap space is bloated this year into $45 million. Teams such as the Jaguars have so much cap space because they lack talent on their roster. Those teams are looking to bring in stars to revitalize the franchise whereas others are just looking to take the next step, whether that become a playoff team or a Super Bowl contender. This year, there are a few teams who have a huge amount of money to spend with an abundance of talent already on the roster. Those are the teams who should be the biggest players in free agency. The Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals have roughly $60 million apiece to spend with very few holes to fill on their roster. While those teams can afford to chase the big names listed above, most of the better teams in the league will be hoping to unearth overlooked stars for less money. Stephen Tulloch and Carlos Rogers are perfect examples of players who were diamonds snatched from the rough last year. Both players are free agents again this year but won't be overlooked after stellar campaigns in 2011. There are plenty of other players whose talents will be overlooked for various reasons this year however: Under-appreciated Kyle Orton: Best known for being the other quarterback in the Jay Cutler trade from Denver to Chicago. Then he became infamous for starting ahead of Tim Tebow. Lost in all the media hype surrounding Tebow, is the fact that Kyle Orton was a good starter in Denver: throwing for 49 touchdowns to 28 interceptions. Those who knock Orton often claim that he is not a winner. The reality is that Orton did enough on offense to win plenty of games in the NFL. The difference between his Broncos' team and Tim Tebow's was the rejuvenation of the team's defense. Orton is by no means an elite quarterback, but in the right system he can be a better than average starter. Orton's arm strength isn't overwhelming but his accuracy and consistency makes him very valuable for teams looking to run some version of the west coast offense. Robert Meachem: The New Orleans Saints have a very deep receiving corp which allowed Drew Brees to break Dan Marino's record for passing yards last season. With Devery Henderson, Marques Colston and Lance Moore all playing prominent roles, Meachem is generally the receiver who is overlooked when recognition is being handed out. Meachem has benefited from playing with a lot of talent in a very good offense, however his production has also suffered from that because he hasn't had the opportunity to be a full-time starter or even be a bigger piece of an offense. He hasn't shown flashes of being a number one receiver, but he could be a reliable second choice or even a third choice receiver in another situation. Meachem has tallied at least 40 receptions in each of the past three seasons for over 1,900 yards and 19 touchdowns. Jason Snelling: It's possible, at this point in their respective careers, that Jason Snelling is actually a better back than Michael Turner. Snelling is a career backup who has seen the field on a regular basis as a third down back in recent years. Unlike most third down backs, Snelling is a big bodied back who runs hard whether it be between the tackles or to the outside. His aggressive running style allows him to punish defenders. Snelling will be signed for very little money but will arrive with the freshness and motivation of a rookie. Eddie Royal: A combination of injuries and Tim Tebow rendered Royal irrelevant last season. Royal is a possession receiver who excels at picking up yardage across the middle or with quick out routes. He isn't a home run hitter but does have the capabilities of breaking free. Royal's rookie season saw him put up over 90 receptions and 900 yards. Ever since Jay Cutler left Denver in 2008, Royal hasn't had the pieces around him to flourish. Tim Tebow's accuracy, or lack thereof, prevents him from finding Royal where he excels, while Josh McDaniels' offense was better suited to the skills of Jabarr Gaffney and Brandon Lloyd. Much like Wes Welker, Royal excels at finding the soft spots in zone coverage and beating defenders on short or intermediate routes. Also like Welker, Royal's production would likely explode in a better system. Martellus Bennett: Jason Witten is one of the best tight ends in the NFL as he excels as both a pass catcher and run blocker. Bennett is his backup who is not as talented a receiver, but may potentially be a better blocker. At only 24, Bennett already has a lot of NFL experience without being a starter. His ability as a receiver isn't overwhelming but he is not as inept as his statistics indicate. Bennett has never eclipsed 300 yards receiving in a season. As far as a blocking tight end, there are few better, and he can still grow as a receiver. He has the talent to be a two way tight end, but will be lost in Dallas behind Witten as well as the team's talented receivers. Bennett could be a lot better as a more prominent figure in any offense. Dwight Lowery: Lowery, who the Jacksonville Jaguars traded for prior to last season from the New York Jets, was missed in New York last year as the team's hybrid third safety and slot cornerback. He may not be good enough to be a starter, but Lowery can contribute a huge amount to any defense. Because of his versatility, he can play multiple positions on the field while being very valuable on nickel and dime defenses ie pass defenses. Lowery was part of a better-than-you-would-think defense in Jacksonville last year while the Jets missed his presence. Even if he is not a turnover machine or shut down cornerback, Lowery is one of those vital players which every team that hopes to compete for Super Bowls needs. He is an excellent role player. Lee Evans: Lots of people wrote off Lee Evans as being old, slow and over the hill after his now infamous drop in the AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots. Sometimes however, we make the mistake of letting one moment define a player. Evans didn't have any sort of impact in the regular season to stave off the doubters and was subsequently released. However, Evans' season wasn't as bad as it initially appears. One thing for certain is that his physical skills are still there. The 30-year-old receiver was traded for by the Ravens prior to the season but was injured early in the year which prevented him from adjusting to his new team. After spending so long with one team, that was vital for him. Once he returned to the team, in Week 11, he had already lost his place in the offense because he had fallen too far behind in team chemistry. Because his physical skills are still there, Evans is definitely worth signing and has potential to be a starting receiver still. One season doesn't make a career. One drop definitely doesn't. Terrell Thomas: Entering last season, I wrote that the New York Giants had the deepest secondary in the NFL, that depth was tested instantly with the loss of one of their starting cornerbacks for the duration. Terrell Thomas and Corey Webster were fantastic as a starting pairing in 2010, with Thomas getting a lot of praise for leading the team in tackles, having five interceptions and forcing four fumbles. The 27-year-old won't receive as much attention as he would if he was fully healthy but on sheer talent alone he is worth gambling on in free agency. Fortunately for him, he should be fully recovered well before the start of next season in order to attract potential suitors. Notable Restricted Free Agents. There are two types of free agent in the NFL. Those listed above are unrestricted free agents. Unrestricted free agents have the right to talk to any teams once free agency begins and can leave their old teams without any consequences. There are also restricted free agents who must act under certain rules. If a restricted free agent signs elsewhere, then his previous team is entitled to compensation which comes in the form of draft picks. After Arian Foster was signed to a long-term deal, Mike Wallace is the only elite restricted free agent available. Wallace faces an interesting off-season as the Pittsburgh Steelers cannot afford to franchsie tag him. Instead, Wallace is a free agent who can only be signed if another team outbids the Steelers and agrees to give them compensation in the form of a first round draft pick in the 2012 draft. For teams picking later in the first round, such as the New England Patriots, Wallace is a realistic target. The Baltimore Ravens Lardarius Webb faces a similar situation with any teams who need a cornerback, but he is less likely to be signed as he is not on Wallace's level. Restricted free agents rarely change teams, but the possibility is there this season. Free agency is generally one of the most exciting parts of the NFL calender. After the Philadelphia Eagles stole the imagination of everyone with their aggressive moves last year, before ultimately faltering during the actual season, there are plenty of teams who could take that ideology to another level. The Eagles may have failed to live up to their all-hype team tag, but that shouldn't scare teams away from making signings this year.",

      "body": "<p>The NFL's free-agency market opens for business next week and a wide array of talent is up-for-grabs.</p> <p>But first NFL teams had the opportunity to decide which players to keep out of that market: a record number of players - 21 - have been franchise-tagged by their teams to stop them joining rivals. The franchise tags - limited to one per team - prevents all-star players who have yet to agree to new contracts, such as New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, from becoming free agents and joining rivals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4718535/keeping-track-of-franchise-tags\">The list of players who were tied to their teams for another year by Monday's tagging deadline also includes</a>: Atlanta Falcons cornerback Brent Grimes; defensive ends Cliff Avril of the Detroit Lions, Robert Mathis of the Indianapolis Colts and Calais Campbell of the Arizona Cardinals; Dallas Cowboys linebacker Anthony Spencer; Washington Redskins tight end Fred Davis; wide receivers Wes Welker of the New England Patriots, Dwayne Bowe of the Kansas City Chiefs and DeSean Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles,; Chicago Bears running back Matt Forte; safeties Dashon Goldson of the San Francisco 49ers, Tyvon Branch of the Oakland Raiders and Michael Griffin of the Tennessee Titans; kickers Mike Nugent, of the Cincinnati Bengals, Connor Bath of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Phil Dawson of the Cleveland Browns, Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos and Josh Scobee of the Jacksonville Jaguars; and New York Giants punter Steve Weatherford.</p> <p>A few players who were expected to be hot properties on the market this year have been tied down to long-term deals, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/StevieJohnson13/status/176676380774383618\">Stevie Johnson agreed to a deal with the Buffalo Bills</a>, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/38805/jermichael-finley-it-was-a-no-brainer\">Jermichael Finley re-signed with the Green Bay Packers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/seattle-seahawks-sign-rb-marshawn-lynch-to-multiyear-contract-and-avoid-using-franchise-tag/2012/03/04/gIQAJdyfrR_story.html\">Marshawn Lynch received a big deal from the Seattle Seahawks</a>.</p> <p>Despite all of this activity, there is still an array of talented players available at the top of this year's free agent market, as well as a constant level of depth running through the group of roughly 600 players who don't have a contract.</p> <p>Here is a list of the top players remaining ahead of the beginning of free agency on March 13 and where they may move to. (*Restricted Free Agents are not included in this list.)</p> <h2>1. Carl Nicks. Offensive Guard</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> New Orleans Saints.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> New Orleans Saints.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> In one sense the Saints are lucky, they have a flurry of the best players available in this year's free agent market. At the same time they are unlucky: they have a flurry of the best players available in this year's free agent market. Carl Nicks isn't just the best guard available this year, he is the best player available after Drew Brees was removed from the equation. Furthermore, Nicks is the best guard in football and one of the best all-around offensive linemen. Nicks, and his teammate, Jahri Evans are generally considered the best tandem in the league. Most elite NFL guards excel at run blocking but don't quite reach the same heights as a pass blocker. Nicks is one of the select few <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/ProFootbalFocus/status/176062477430296578\">who can consistently dominate the opposition in both facets of the game</a>. At just 26 he is about to enter his prime.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The biggest issue is value. Few teams invest that much in NFL guards. Guards are not valued in the same way tackles or centers are because teams can somewhat cover guards' deficiencies with help from players around them. Centers have to set protections while tackles are asked to contain the best blitzers in the league on the outside. Nicks won't see things that way and has already stated that <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/02/21/carl-nicks-expects-to-make-more-than-teammate-evans/\">he wants to be paid more than teammate Jahri Evans</a> who received a $56 million deal in 2010, which is now the second highest in football at the position.<br>Few teams will be willing to commit that much money to a guard because few teams would make use of all of Nicks' skills the way the Saints do. Most teams are either primarily running teams or passing teams. Signing for one of them wouldn't allow Nicks to completely show off his talents.</p> <h2>2. Mario Williams. 4-3 Defensive End</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Houston Texans.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals defense was ranked in the top 10 last year under defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer. Although they have an all-around team in terms of talent, they lack any marquee talent in the front seven. Adding Williams to Geno Atkins inside and potentially a fully fit Carlos Dunlap on the other side, would give the team one of the most dangerous defensive lines in football.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Williams is one of the best defensive ends in the NFL, but because of the Texans' scheme, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7083480/mario-williams-houston-texans-rest-season\">he was asked to play linebacker last year before being injured</a>. His strengths are such that he is suited to play with his hand in the ground on every play.<br>At 6'6\" and 280lbs, Williams can overpower opposing tackles in one on one situations. Williams is so big that he can often still be effective when double teamed, but he is also athletic and can use his speed and agility to beat blockers. Despite playing on a poor defense for most of his career, Williams was still a productive player in Houston.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> After being selected first overall in 2006, ahead of Reggie Bush, Williams will not be cheap despite coming off a season ended prematurely through injury. Huge expectations will come with Williams wherever he signs which doesn't afford him any opportunity to adjust to a new team or deal with any carry overs from his injury. There have been some question marks over his consistency and commitment when playing the run, but we could chalk those down to nitpicking from those who must find flaws where they often don't exist.</p> <h2>3. Vincent Jackson. Wide Receiver</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> San Diego Chargers.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Tennessee Titans. The Titans don't know what to expect from Kenny Britt after tearing his ACL last season, while they need to build the offense for Jake Locker in the future. Locker has a huge arm, therefore bringing in Jackson, who is great at beating defenders deep. He, Nate Washington and Kenny Britt would give the Titans an offense similar to the Chargers' who love big receivers who excel deep.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Jackson's biggest strength is just that, his strength. Along with Stevie Johnson, Dez Bryant and Larry Fitzgerald, Jackson has the strongest upper body of any receiver in the NFL. Upper body strength is often overlooked because of the pass interference rules at the professional level of football, however it is vital for gaining position on the football and adjusting to make receptions in difficult situations. During his time in San Diego, Jackson may not have been the best of route runners, but he always had the ability to take the top off defenses with his speed and was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqVZ4bPROlA\">almost impossible to cover with just one defender</a>. Even with his size, he still has the speed to get downfield faster than most defensive backs. That is a vicious combination for any player to have. While solid receivers are easy enough to find, signing a receiver that changes the way opposing defenses approach the game is a huge coup.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/jan/07/1s7jackson22147-jackson-arrested-dui-charge/\">Off-the-field problems are evident in Jackson's past</a> but plenty of NFL receivers have had these sort of issues: worse is that Jackson's last problem came during a playofff run. Jackson, who is now 29, has been determined to get a big contract in free agency. Whoever lands him will need a strong coaching staff and plenty of locker-room leadership.</p> <h2>4. Matt Flynn. Quarterback</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Green Bay Packers.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Miami Dolphins. With Flynn's QB coach from Green Bay becoming the Miami Dolphins' head coach, you can expect the Dolphins to be high on Flynn's list of potential suitors. Given the hype surrounding Flynn, going to a team where he would have to compete for the job would likely work in his favour. Matt Moore is capable of starting for the Dolphins so Flynn would have to earn his position.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Judging Flynn isn't easy because he has only two career starts. <a href=\"http://www.irishcentral.com/sport/Match-Report-New-England-Patriots-V-Green-Bay-Packers-112186139.html?page=2\">On his first Flynn displayed none of the nerves and uncertainty that most first timers </a> are prone to. Flynn did his best Aaron Rodgers impression showing off a strong arm, good pocket awareness and consistent accuracy. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=_C8F0cWvAfo#t=515s\">His biggest mistake that night was a rookie one when he failed to get the final play in on time with the game on the line which led to a sack</a>. In his second start, Flynn picked apart the Detroit Lions' defense for an unbelievable 480 yards, a Green Bay Packers' record surpassing Brett Favre, Bart Starr and Aaron Rodgers. It is on those two performances that he must be judged.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Only as a quarterback would a player with two professional starts receive such attention in the NFL. Flynn's small sample size may be overwhelmingly impressive, but it remains a small sample.</p> <h2>5. Cortland Finnegan. Corner Back</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Tennessee Titans.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Tennessee Titans.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Finnegan showed last season that his talent can trump his reputation playing to a Pro Bowl level. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBT6MygnKKw\">His aggressive nature has boiled over on occasion and hurt his team with personal foul penalties</a>, however last year he showed a previously unseen level of maturity as a team captain. Finnegan is an aggressive tackler who plays well in tight coverage or dropping into zone. As a veteran there is nothing in this league that he hasn't seen and handled.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> He is not the biggest of corners and can be exposed against bigger receivers in jump-ball situations while his reputation around the league can see him penalized more often than other players. Signing Finnegan isn't necessarily a risk to your team chemistry, but it does bring another character into the locker-room which can cause unpredictable changes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBT6MygnKKw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBT6MygnKKw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p> <h2>6. Ben Grubbs. Offensive Guard</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Baltimore Ravens.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Seattle Seahawks. Tom Cable, the offensive line coach in Seattle, loves big grafting run blockers like Grubbs. Adding Grubbs would finish off an offensive line which has been completely rebuilt. He and Robert Gallery blowing open holes for Marshawn Lynch would be a winning formula in the NFC West.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Grubbs is one of the better run-blocking offensive linemen in the NFL. He has been a starter in Baltimore since his rookie season in 2007 and, along with Marshal Yanda, has been a big reason for Ray Rice's success with the Ravens. At 27 he has just entered his prime, he is durable, big and athletic without being a liability as a pass protector. While he may not be as good as Carl Nicks, his versatility and all-around game would make him a valuable addition to almost any NFL offensive line.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Grubbs will be looking for a lot of money. Despite being very good, is he elite? Grubbs is in a typical position where a player can take a lot of money to play with a lesser team. It will be difficult for a contender to sign him at a reasonable rate.</p> <h2>7. Marques Colston. Wide Receiver</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> New Orleans Saints.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Minnesota Vikings. Colston won't get the biggest deal of the receivers in free agency this year but he could represent the best value. Many will overlook his achievements in New Orleans because of the high-powered offense which he was a part of - however he was the team's best wide receiver.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Colston is a rangy receiver with reliable speed who can beat opposing teams' best cover cornerbacks. Unlike most bigger receivers, Colston can run a variety of routes and is more of an all-around receiver than say a Dwayne Bowe or Stevie Johnson. His ability to be a possession receiver or big play option makes him invaluable to any receiver-needy offenses. He has eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in five of his first six seasons and isn't limited in the ways which he can gain separation from defenders whether it be through straight line speed or shiftiness inside. In New Orleans he showed reliable hands and a consistency in finding the endzone. Despite never starting a full season, <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/player/marquescolston/2495821/profile\">Colston had 48 touchdown receptions for the Saints in six years</a>. In Minnesota, alongside Percy Harvin, that streak could easily continue.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Much of Colston's success has come on turf in a dome. Being signed by a cold-weather team could reduce his effectiveness. Colston is not a receiver who will scare opposing defenses to the point where they send extra coverage his way.</p> <h2>8. LaRon Landry. Strong Safety</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Washington Redskins.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Washington Redskins.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Landry is one of those physical specimens at safety in the mould of Troy Polamalu and Adrian Wilson. His ability to cover a huge amount of ground makes him invaluable against both the run and the pass. Even when reacting to plays rather than anticipating them, Landry is able to make an impact with his presence. His potential is endless and, to an extent, untapped.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A combination of being injured the past two seasons and the Redskins' overall quality of defense prior to then has curtailed the impact that Landry has been able to make so far in his NFL career. Essentially you would be investing in potential opposed to performance. For this reason, he is most likely going to re-sign with the Redskins where Jim Haslett can make best use of his talents. Whether he has hurt or helped himself by <a href=\"http://yfrog.com/gynqxbxpj\">bulking up so dramatically this off-season</a> will also be a worry.</p> <h2>9. Brandon Carr. Cornerback</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Kansas City Chiefs.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Dallas Cowboys. Terrence Newman is expected to be a cap casualty while Orlando Scandrick remains an unproven commodity as a starter. Mike Jenkins inconsistency continued last season while the Cowboys' secondary as a whole needs to be upgraded. Carr would have been certain to return to <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7594856/ex-oakland-raiders-cb-stanford-routt-joins-kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City prior to the team signing Stanford Routt.</a><br><strong>Strengths:</strong> There is a lot of talk about Brandon Carr being a product of a system. That reference is to the fact that the Chiefs play their corners in press coverage more often than not. Finding corners good in press coverage is very difficult. He has a skill-set which is rare in today's NFL and as such, he will likely be one of the more sought-after players come free agency.<br>Carr is not a number one corner on a good defense. However he is an above average second starter who is entering the prime of his career. Whatever team adds him will be able to get his best years out of him.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Before last year Carr didn't come up with many turnovers. Even last season he only had four interceptions. Because of the way he plays the game, interceptions aren't going to be a regular occurrence as he instead prevents the opposition's receivers from catching the ball. For some franchises that is a negative, however some wouldn't even call that a weakness.</p> <h2>10. Jared Gaither. Offensive tackle</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Oakland Raiders/Kansas City Chiefs/San Diego Chargers.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> San Diego Chargers.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Last season, Gaither wasn't re-signed by the Baltimore Ravens before losing out on a roster spot in Oakland with the Raiders. He was infamously cut by the Kansas City Chiefs after <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/11/29/chiefs-cut-jared-gaither/\">false starting on one of his few snaps</a>. He then landed with the Chargers and, <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1061327-nfl-free-agency-2012-jared-gaither-will-be-the-most-overlooked-player-this-year\">statistically, was one of the best left tackles in the NFL last year</a>. Gaither has the bulk to withstand bull rushers from bigger pass-rushers, while his nimble feet and good balance lets him keep his body between blitzers and his quarterback. He is rarely ever beaten off the snap and also excels as a run-blocker. Despite being in the NFL for a long time, he is yet to enter the prime of his career at only 25 years old. Left tackles with elite talent are not easy to find, it is why players like Joe Thomas, Jake Long and Ryan Clady were all drafted so high out of college. Picking up one with potentially his best years ahead of him, without breaking the bank, would be a huge pickup for most teams.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Injuries: He has suffered many of them during his NFL career including <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/10/22/report-ravens-to-place-jared-gaither-on-injured-reserve/\">a back injury which cost him the whole of his 2010 season</a>. When he has been on the field he has been an elite performer. Even James Harrison in his prime became a victim of Gaither's when he was in Baltimore. Very few tackles can say that. He is certainly a risk, but the possible reward is huge.</p> <h2>11. John Abraham. Defensive end</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Atlanta Falcons.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> New Orleans Saints. At 34 years of age, Abraham needs to give himself the best opportunity to win a Super Bowl before retiring. He has been paid handsomely throughout his career as an Atlanta Falcon but it is time for him to give himself the best opportunity to win in the playoffs which he can't do in Atlanta. Abraham would be the perfect starter to take the place of Cameron Jordan while also teaching him for the future.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Abraham has been a star pass-rusher in Atlanta for years without much help. He is proven against double teams and has all the physical tools required. With 112 sacks in 12 NFL seasons, and most recently 9.5 last year, Abraham's experience is also invaluable to whatever team signs him. Despite being an older player, Abraham won't have to be a situational pass-rusher similar to Jason Taylor over the past few years. Abraham is dominant against both the run and the pass who requires double teams in order to be contained.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Whoever signs Abraham will have to understand that he is only a short-term option. The threat remains that he could struggle to adapt to a new team after so long with the Falcons while the risk of age getting the better of him is always a worry. Whether it was because of the lack of quality around him or not, Abraham was never really capable of taking over games against better teams in big situations. As a role player on a better team, he should flourish.</p> <h2>12. Stephen Tulloch. Linebacker</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Detroit Lions.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Detroit Lions.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> The Lions signed Tulloch despite having a reputation for being just a tackler. In Detroit, Tulloch proved himself to be a playmaker with three sacks and two interceptions from the middle linebacker position. Tulloch is an athletic player with the ability to cover the middle of the field in the passing game as well as plug the running game. At 27 he is at the prime of his career and has a huge amount of experience with nearly 400 tackles in the last three seasons. Tulloch sweeps up attackers and is always around the football on the field.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Despite having 568 career tackles, Tulloch has never forced a fumble. His production last year was huge compared to the previous five seasons in Tennessee with the Titans. Prior to last season, Tulloch had one interception and 4.5 sacks. Whether last season was Tulloch's breakout year or just a one off is yet to be determined. If it is a breakout season, the ceiling isn't that high, if it's not, investing in Tulloch is a risk.</p> <h2>13. Curtis Lofton. Linebacker</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Atlanta Falcons.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Atlanta Falcons.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> The Atlanta Falcons rush defense has been ranked in the top 10 for the past three seasons: Curtis Lofton is a big reason for that. Lofton, who has been a starter in Atlanta for four seasons, is a strong run defender with the ability to not only rack up the tackles, but also shut down runners before they even get to the line of scrimmage. He is built like a bowling ball which allows him to burst through offensive linemen to make plays all over the field. His strength and low center of gravity makes him a bullish tackler who rarely lets his target free.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> As good as Lofton is against the run, he is a limited coverage linebacker. While dominating opposing team's running games, Lofton can often be exposed in coverage whether it be zone or man assignments. The same height that helps him shut down the running game hinders him in space with receivers and tight ends.</p> <h2>14. Paul Soliai. Nose tackle</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> Miami Dolphins.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> Kansas City Chiefs. Soliai won't be returning to Miami with the Dolphins as they transition away from the 3-4 defense. Instead, he would be a perfect fit for Kansas City who can't rely on Kelly Gregg to be the team's nose tackle next year. The Chiefs ranked 26th against the run last year, bringing in a specialist run stuffer cannot hurt them.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Soliai is a specialist run stuffer who was important enough to the Miami Dolphins' 3-4 scheme that they franchise tagged him prior to last season. At 355 lbs, he consumes a huge amount of space and <a href=\"http://football.calsci.com/DefensiveLine3.html\">has the bulk to entertain more than one gap responsibility</a>. At 28 years old, Soliai is in his prime with plenty of quality snaps left in the tank. He is one of those players who receives no credit but goes about his job quietly and effectively.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> As a specialist run stuffer, Soliai offers nothing in the passing game. He is a two down defender who must come out in passing situations because of his inability to move in space. He has two career sacks in five years, both coming in 2010. Soliai is great at what he does, but what he does is limited to one aspect of playing football.</p> <h2>15. Carlos Rogers. Cornerback</h2> <p><strong>2011 team:</strong> San Francisco 49ers.<br><strong>Best fit for 2012:</strong> San Francisco 49ers.<br><strong>Strengths:</strong> Rogers was a free agent last season who didn't exactly get the big deal he was hoping for. However once signed, he proved himself worthy of big money with a stellar season. During his time in Washington, Rogers had a reputation for dropping footballs. That wasn't the case in SF last year as he showed great awareness and hands picking off six passes, returning one for a touchdown. Rogers is a solid tackler with the ability to stick to receivers. His toughness and strength is above average in comparison to most players at his position.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Rogers is essentially a one year wonder. He had some solid campaigns with the Redskins but never reached the levels of 2011. At 30 years of age, it is difficult to commit a lot of money to a cornerback who has only had one truly impact full season. Returning to San Francisco to familiar surroundings at least removes some of the risk of signing with another team.</p> <h2>Which teams will invest in free agents</h2> <p>Many teams won't have the opportunity to sign those players, but there are a few who are expected to be big spenders in free agency, much like the Philadelphia Eagles were last year. After last year's lockout, the NFL created a new collective bargaining agreement: One major difference to this agreement allows NFL teams to carry over cap room from previous seasons.</p> <p>While this year's cap number is as of yet unknown, last year's was $120 million. Therefore, under the new rules, teams were able to bring over whatever the difference was between their actual spending and the $120 million mark. Therefore, for a team like the Jacksonville Jaguars, who finished last season with $31 million of space, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7570116/nfl-plenty-cap-room-improve\">their cap space is bloated this year into $45 million</a>. Teams such as the Jaguars have so much cap space because they lack talent on their roster. Those teams are looking to bring in stars to revitalize the franchise whereas others are just looking to take the next step, whether that become a playoff team or a Super Bowl contender.</p> <p>This year, there are a few teams who have a huge amount of money to spend with an abundance of talent already on the roster. Those are the teams who should be the biggest players in free agency. The Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals have roughly $60 million apiece to spend with very few holes to fill on their roster.</p> <p>While those teams can afford to chase the big names listed above, most of the better teams in the league will be hoping to unearth overlooked stars for less money. Stephen Tulloch and Carlos Rogers are perfect examples of players who were diamonds snatched from the rough last year. Both players are free agents again this year but won't be overlooked after stellar campaigns in 2011.<br>There are plenty of other players whose talents will be overlooked for various reasons this year however:</p> <h2>Under-appreciated</h2> <p><strong>Kyle Orton:</strong> <br>Best known for being the other quarterback in the Jay Cutler trade from Denver to Chicago. Then he became infamous for starting ahead of Tim Tebow. Lost in all the media hype surrounding Tebow, is the fact that Kyle Orton was a good starter in Denver: throwing for 49 touchdowns to 28 interceptions. Those who knock Orton often claim that he is not a winner. The reality is that Orton did enough on offense to win plenty of games in the NFL. The difference between his Broncos' team and Tim Tebow's was the rejuvenation of the team's defense. Orton is by no means an elite quarterback, but in the right system he can be a better than average starter. Orton's arm strength isn't overwhelming but his accuracy and consistency makes him very valuable for teams looking to run some version of <a href=\"http://football.about.com/od/offensivestrategy/a/West-Coast.htm\">the west coast offense</a>.</p> <p><strong>Robert Meachem:</strong> <br>The New Orleans Saints have a very deep receiving corp which allowed Drew Brees to break Dan Marino's record for passing yards last season. With Devery Henderson, Marques Colston and Lance Moore all playing prominent roles, Meachem is generally the receiver who is overlooked when recognition is being handed out. Meachem has benefited from playing with a lot of talent in a very good offense, however his production has also suffered from that because he hasn't had the opportunity to be a full-time starter or even be a bigger piece of an offense. He hasn't shown flashes of being a number one receiver, but he could be a reliable second choice or even a third choice receiver in another situation. Meachem has tallied at least 40 receptions in each of the past three seasons for over 1,900 yards and 19 touchdowns.</p> <p><strong>Jason Snelling:</strong> It's possible, at this point in their respective careers, that Jason Snelling is actually a better back than Michael Turner. Snelling is a career backup who has seen the field on a regular basis as a third down back in recent years. Unlike most third down backs, Snelling is a big bodied back who runs hard whether it be between the tackles or to the outside. His aggressive running style allows him to punish defenders. Snelling will be signed for very little money but will arrive with the freshness and motivation of a rookie.</p> <p><strong>Eddie Royal:</strong> <br>A combination of injuries and Tim Tebow rendered Royal irrelevant last season. Royal is a possession receiver who excels at picking up yardage across the middle or with quick out routes. He isn't a home run hitter but does have the capabilities of breaking free. Royal's rookie season saw him put up over 90 receptions and 900 yards. Ever since Jay Cutler left Denver in 2008, Royal hasn't had the pieces around him to flourish. Tim Tebow's accuracy, or lack thereof, prevents him from finding Royal where he excels, while Josh McDaniels' offense was better suited to the skills of Jabarr Gaffney and Brandon Lloyd. Much like Wes Welker, Royal excels at finding the soft spots in zone coverage and beating defenders on short or intermediate routes. <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/player/weswelker/2505790/profile\">Also like Welker</a>, Royal's production would likely explode in a better system.</p> <p><strong>Martellus Bennett:</strong> <br>Jason Witten is one of the best tight ends in the NFL as he excels as both a pass catcher and run blocker. Bennett is his backup who is not as talented a receiver, but may potentially be a better blocker. At only 24, Bennett already has a lot of NFL experience without being a starter. His ability as a receiver isn't overwhelming but he is not as inept as his statistics indicate. Bennett has never eclipsed 300 yards receiving in a season. As far as a blocking tight end, there are few better, and he can still grow as a receiver. He has the talent to be a two way tight end, but will be lost in Dallas behind Witten as well as the team's talented receivers. Bennett could be a lot better as a more prominent figure in any offense.</p> <p><strong>Dwight Lowery:</strong> <br>Lowery, who the Jacksonville Jaguars traded for prior to last season from the New York Jets, was missed in New York last year as the team's hybrid third safety and slot cornerback. He may not be good enough to be a starter, but Lowery can contribute a huge amount to any defense. Because of his versatility, he can play multiple positions on the field while being very valuable on nickel and dime defenses ie pass defenses. Lowery was part of a better-than-you-would-think defense in Jacksonville last year while the Jets missed his presence. Even if he is not a turnover machine or shut down cornerback, Lowery is one of those vital players which every team that hopes to compete for Super Bowls needs. He is an excellent role player. </p> <p><strong>Lee Evans:</strong> Lots of people wrote off Lee Evans as being old, slow and over the hill after his now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIH-GrnnPVM\">infamous drop in the AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots</a>. Sometimes however, we make the mistake of letting one moment define a player. Evans didn't have any sort of impact in the regular season to stave off the doubters and was subsequently released. However, Evans' season wasn't as bad as it initially appears. One thing for certain is that his physical skills are still there. The 30-year-old receiver was traded for by the Ravens prior to the season but was injured early in the year which prevented him from adjusting to his new team. After spending so long with one team, that was vital for him. Once he returned to the team, in Week 11, he had already lost his place in the offense because he had fallen too far behind in team chemistry. Because his physical skills are still there, Evans is definitely worth signing and has potential to be a starting receiver still. One season doesn't make a career. One drop definitely doesn't.</p> <p><strong>Terrell Thomas:</strong><br>Entering last season, <a href=\"http://www.ffblife.com/index.php/cian-fahey-blog-layout/133-2011-nfc-south-prediction\">I wrote that the New York Giants had the deepest secondary in the NFL</a>, that depth was tested instantly with <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/6886500/new-york-giants-cb-terrell-thomas-suffers-torn-acl-vs-chicago-bears\">the loss of one of their starting cornerbacks for the duration</a>. Terrell Thomas and Corey Webster were fantastic as a starting pairing in 2010, with Thomas getting a lot of praise for leading the team in tackles, having five interceptions and forcing four fumbles. The 27-year-old won't receive as much attention as he would if he was fully healthy but on sheer talent alone he is worth gambling on in free agency. Fortunately for him, he should be fully recovered well before the start of next season in order to attract potential suitors.</p> <h2>Notable Restricted Free Agents.</h2> <p>There are two types of free agent in the NFL. Those listed above are unrestricted free agents. Unrestricted free agents have the right to talk to any teams once free agency begins and can leave their old teams without any consequences. There are also restricted free agents who must act under certain rules. If a restricted free agent signs elsewhere, then his previous team is entitled to compensation which comes in the form of draft picks.</p> <p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7647019/houston-texans-reach-new-contract-star-rb-arian-foster-agent-says\">After Arian Foster was signed to a long-term deal,</a> Mike Wallace is the only elite restricted free agent available. Wallace faces an interesting off-season as the Pittsburgh Steelers cannot afford to franchsie tag him. Instead, Wallace is a free agent who can only be signed if another team outbids the Steelers and agrees to give them compensation in the form of a first round draft pick in the 2012 draft. For teams picking later in the first round, <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1055220-new-england-patriots-pittsburgh-steelers-mike-wallace-is-a-realistic-target\">such as the New England Patriots</a>, Wallace is a realistic target. </p> <p>The Baltimore Ravens Lardarius Webb faces a similar situation with any teams who need a cornerback, but he is less likely to be signed as he is not on Wallace's level.</p> <p>Restricted free agents rarely change teams, but the possibility is there this season.</p> <p>Free agency is generally one of the most exciting parts of the NFL calender. After the Philadelphia Eagles stole the imagination of everyone with their aggressive moves last year, before ultimately faltering during the actual season, there are plenty of teams who could take that ideology to another level. The Eagles may have failed to live up to their all-hype team tag, but that shouldn't scare teams away from making signings this year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "RTL has reported a 4.6% increase in pre-tax profits to \u20ac1.19bn (\u00a30.99bn) in 2011, as the launch of Simon Cowell's The X Factor USA fuelled a double-digit revenue increase at production arm FremantleMedia. The pan-European broadcaster reported total revenues up 4.2% to \u20ac5.8n as earnings before interest, tax and amortisation rose 0.2% to \u20ac1.1bn. Net profit grew 13.9% to \u20ac696m. Chief executive Gerhard Zeiler, presiding over his last set of results before leaving RTL after nine years to join Turner Broadcasting, praised the \"outstanding performance\" of FremantleMedia's North American operation for helping the business bounce back after a tough 2010. He said that the US launch of The X Factor, a co-production with Cowell's Syco, helped to \"more than compensate\" for the cancellation of The Bill by ITV and Australian productions of The Biggest Loser and So You Think You Can Dance which resulted in a 10% fall in profits for the division in 2010. FremantleMedia's revenues rose 12.3% to \u20ac1.43bn year on year, 24.8% of total RTL revenues, while profits grew 2.1% to \u20ac143m. The X Factor franchise expanded to eight new territories in 2011, taking its presence to 29, while Got Talent rolled out to six new territories to take its total to 45. Fremantle also makes shows for the UK including The Apprentice and Celebrity Juice, which has had excellent ratings on ITV2 exceeding the prime-time audience average by 550%, according to RTL. RTL said that FremantleMedia's results also benefited from the first full-year performance from acquisitions Radical Media, music video production business behind Metallica documentary Some Kind of Monster, and Ludia, which makes games for TV shows including The Price is Right and American Idol. RTL said that total group online advertising rose 23% year on year, driven by video advertising. Video views across its pan-European business rose 35% to 1.9bn. RTL took a \u20ac96m charge mainly relating to selling its 70% stake in Alpha Media Group to exit the beleaguered Greek TV market. Zeiler said that it was too early to forecast figures for RTL for 2012 but noted that sports events such as the London Olympics and European football championships will \"front load\" results for the first half. \"Looking at January and February 2012 it can be noted that the negative development many had feared, did not happen,\" said. \"If this macroeconomic development continues for the whole year, we expect a stable result for 2012.\" RTL paid a dividend of \u20ac5.10 per share, 10% higher year on year. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "Whittington Health has ambitions plans for the future. It hopes to achieve foundation trust status by 2014 and its first step to ensure it made sufficient efficiency savings in order to do so was to fully integrate local community services with the hospital last year. In January it had reached 98% of its cost improvement programme (CIP) target for the financial year as a result. The integrated health organisation is a merger of the formerly named Whittington hospital, Islington PCT and Haringey PCT \u2013 including Haringey children's services. Dr Yi Mien Koh was appointed as chief executive of the organisation almost a year ago in time to oversee the integration of the services. In an interview with the Guardian's healthcare network at the Nuffield Trust health policy summit last week she said that one of the biggest challenges of the merger was integrating staff's ways of thinking. \"It was three different cultures, three different ways of working, three different sets of conditions. But as a result what we now have is one structure that takes the patients all the way from the front door in to the community.\" Koh has had to find new ways to incentivise staff as the trust moves forward with its strategic plan for to improve efficiency and the quality of healthcare through integration. \"Incentivising clinicians to work in a different way is key\", she said. \"For example, not asking patients to turn up at out patients, but instead asking can we go out in to the community; asking clinicians to work via telephones and emails.\" The trust has already introduced telephone consultations with patients, something to be continued in the long-term provided all clinicians adopt the approach. For some staff, \"taking the patient all the way from the front door\" is taken so seriously that they communicate with patients online via online platforms such as Twitter. Koh explained: \"Certainly with children, for example, who have long-term conditions like diabetes, they are already communicating with their pediatricians how to manage their condition on a day-to-day basis through Twitter. The young people get real time feedback which is better.\" The chief executive has asked GPs to adopt other new ways which she hopes will drive efficiency and improve the quality of care at Whittington Health. GPs are incentivised to communicate with patients through emails by being paid a small amount extra for each email correspondence used instead of letters. Whittington Health has also bought a new electronic patient records system that will integrate GP and social care systems next year. But, according to Koh, buying the IT is only part of the challenge. \"Ten per cent of the challenge is finding the money, and 90% is culture change \u2013 getting staff to want to use it. The NHS is very good at implementing new technology, but keeping the old. We're just not keeping the old. \"What we want to do by the end of the year is have 50% of all communication with patients by emails. But the GPs are actually resisting because they say that patients who don't have internet access will have to print it off anyway, as will GPs who don't adopt the electronic patient records system. \"We are thinking about how we can make electronic the easier option, as it costs a lot of money to process the paper.\" For Koh the challenge to drive innovation and efficiency at Whittington Health is a big one, but it is one she is determined to meet by bringing her staff with her. \"We're on a triathlon. This is the analogy I usually use for my team. We have the swimming and the cycling and the running. We are now starting to swim but we are only are only in the beginning \u2013 we still have cycling and running to do. So I say, don't tire yourself out too much. We still have a lot to do. \"But some people, if they are not fit, then you're just going to drop out half way. So we need to be leaner, and part of being lean is getting the organisation of staff structurally fitter. \"It is very challenging but the biggest thing for me is bring staff with me on this journey.

      "bodyText": "European car manufacturers are suffering from an unsustainable production glut, the boss of Vauxhall Motors has warned at the start of the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. Duncan Aldred spoke as executives at Vauxhall's parent, General Motors, mulled the closure of the Ellesmere Port factory with the loss of up to 2,800 jobs. Speaking in Geneva, Aldred said business plans drawn up shortly before the credit crunch were based on the expectation of selling 20m cars a year in Europe alone by 2014. This year, analysts expect 12m cars to be sold in western Europe. \"There is too much capacity. The industry cannot sustain forever the level of capacity it has got.\" He added: \"It does not create a good business model.\" GM's European operations, where the US group makes the Opel and Vauxhall brands, lost $747m (\u00a3471m) last year \u2013 a performance described as \"simply unacceptable\" by GM. Warning of another difficult year for European mass-volume car makers, Aldred added that sales had collapsed in some parts of southern Europe. Aldred declined to comment on the future of Ellesmere Port, which is believed to be on the critical list alongside GM's Opel plant in Bochum, Germany. However, Aldred paid tribute to GM's UK operations, pointing to the amount of executive talent they have produced over the years. \"The [GM] operation is filled with a lot of UK guys \u2026 We are a great exporter of both ideas and talent.\" Aldred, appointed chairman of Vauxhall in January, added that the pound's competitiveness against the euro gave the UK an ongoing advantage in manufacturing. While UK car sales have fallen to their lowest since 1994 with 1.94m new registrations last year, manufacturing is enjoying a boom with a 5.8% increase in the number of cars made in Britain last year. \"A lot of the reasons why we are seeing a lot of investment in the UK, or at least sustaining what is already in there, is because it gives a big natural hedge against the currency,\" Aldred said. The business secretary, Vince Cable, faces further questions about Ellesmere Port's future this morning when he attends the Nissan press conference in Geneva. Nissan will announce the creation of 400 new jobs at its Sunderland plant, the largest in the UK, as well as up to 1,600 more in the supply chain when it confirms that a new compact car is to be built in the north-east. Separately, the French car maker Peugeot Citro\u00ebn has announced it will hold a \u20ac1bn (\u00a3832m) rights issue to fund its alliance with GM. \"This will allow us to accelerate our international expansion and our move into higher-end models faster than we would have been able to do on our own,\" said Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon, the chief financial officer of PSA Peugeot.",

      "bodyText": "Across the country, it's a fair bet that right now, an awful lot of gamers are praying for the sort of snow that decimates public transport and provides a ready-made excuse to skip work. After all, there are more important things to do, such as saving the universe. And that's precisely what the third instalment of BioWare's epic space-RPG Mass Effect offers. Yes, Commander Shepard is back and, this time around, things are bad even by his (or her \u2013 as ever, you can choose Shepard's gender and appearance) standards. Those dastardly sentient machines the Reapers are coming, with their agenda of exterminating all organic life, and it's up to Shepard to stop them. With you at the controls. If you've played one of the two previous Mass Effect games, you'll know what to expect \u2013 nothing less than a near-TV series-length slab of space opera that plays like a third-person shooter while providing all the character development an RPG fanatic could desire. You'll also find proceedings reassuringly familiar: Mass Effect's conventions and controls remain more or less untouched in its third incarnation, although it does achieve new heights of polish and slickness. BioWare always intended Mass Effect 3 to be the conclusion of a trilogy, and it has a suitably simple yet conclusive plot. The Reapers, as Shepard has long warned everyone they would, launch their invasion \u2013 starting with Earth, where Shepard has been grounded by the Alliance. Naturally, after a bit of gentle tutorial-style action, he escapes \u2013 back at the helm of the Normandy, with a brief to head to the Citadel and convince the perennially squabbling alien races that they all need to band together or the Reapers will wipe them out. Conveniently \u2013 and at least the dialogue has the wit to discuss that it might be a bit too conveniently \u2013 he's able to visit Mars and snatch the blueprint for a weapon sufficiently advanced to take out the Reapers, from the sinister grasp of Cerberus, his employer in Mass Effect 2. Plenty of old friends from the franchise are back with central roles \u2013 Liara T'Soni is Shepard's trusty lieutenant this time around, while Garrus and Ashley Williams also feature \u2013 and plenty of action takes place on the Krogan homeworld Tuchanka, as bleak and uninviting as ever. The plot slots beautifully into Mass Effect's structural framework. Shepard soon finds old feuds between alien races are still raging, and so must carry out missions that bring them into the fold, this time with an extra dramatic backdrop provided by the Reaper invasion, as many of the places he visits are full-on war-zones. As Shepard, you get to make momentous decisions that determine which alien races join in with the Alliance effort, so there's diplomacy to be performed when you aren't shooting aliens. Cerberus constantly pop up, throwing whole bags of spanners into the works. The story is full of twists and little subtleties that will delight fans of the series, and those who have never played a Mass Effect game before will be astonished by its depth and richness. The ability to shape parts of it with your actions makes it even more involving. While the basic mechanics of the game haven't been altered \u2013 the wheel that lets you select weapons and powers is the same as ever, for example \u2013 BioWare has indulged in plenty of judicious tweaking. This time around, Shepard is noticeably more mobile and moves in a more fluid way, which is handy in a firefight. The layout of the Normandy has changed (it's back to being an alliance, rather than Cerberus, ship), and the mining mechanic has been abandoned as being irrelevant in the context of a universe-wide war. Instead, the Alliance funds you, which is a lot simpler than fiddling around looking for rare elements. And there are plenty of random missions to be found on planets beset by the Reapers. There's also a co-operative mode for the first time \u2013 having humans rather than AI in your squad is something all Mass Effect players, surely, have craved \u2013 and an almost board game-like iOS app which is all about reclaiming the universe, planet by planet, from the Reapers, and what you do in the single-payer game can feed back into it. Mass Effect always had vast amounts of replay value, and that just adds to it. More than ever, the Mass effect universe pulls off the masterful trick of feeling huge and yet believable \u2013 the game's production values are through the roof, and its third-person shooter controls incredibly precise, responsive and accurate given Mass Effect's immense scope. It really does feel like a TV sci-fi series in which you play the central character \u2013 which highlights the current absence of significant sci-fi series from our TV screens. It's even the first Mass Effect game to let you play as a male Shepard and have gay relationships \u2013 although those are conducted in such a stiff and awkward manner that you don't feel BioWare was particularly comfortable about making them. But at least they show the game's desire to provide a mature form of entertainment which lacks nothing in comparison with Hollywood or television. Show it to the next person who maintains games are vacant and unsophisticated, and watch them squirm as they're forced to acknowledge their ignorance. \u2022 Mass Effect 3 was reviewed on the Xbox 360",

With you at the controls.</p> <p>If you've played one of the two previous Mass Effect games, you'll know what to expect \u2013 nothing less than a near-TV series-length slab of space opera that plays like a third-person shooter while providing all the character development an RPG fanatic could desire. You'll also find proceedings reassuringly familiar: Mass Effect's conventions and controls remain more or less untouched in its third incarnation, although it does achieve new heights of polish and slickness.</p> <p>BioWare always intended Mass Effect 3 to be the conclusion of a trilogy, and it has a suitably simple yet conclusive plot. The Reapers, as Shepard has long warned everyone they would, launch their invasion \u2013 starting with Earth, where Shepard has been grounded by the Alliance. Naturally, after a bit of gentle tutorial-style action, he escapes \u2013 back at the helm of the Normandy, with a brief to head to the Citadel and convince the perennially squabbling alien races that they all need to band together or the Reapers will wipe them out.</p> <p>Conveniently \u2013 and at least the dialogue has the wit to discuss that it might be a bit too conveniently \u2013 he's able to visit Mars and snatch the blueprint for a weapon sufficiently advanced to take out the Reapers, from the sinister grasp of Cerberus, his employer in Mass Effect 2.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386937907\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330961107352/Mass-Effect-3-005.jpg\" alt=\"Mass Effect 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mass Effect 3</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plenty of old friends from the franchise are back with central roles \u2013 Liara T'Soni is Shepard's trusty lieutenant this time around, while Garrus and Ashley Williams also feature \u2013 and plenty of action takes place on the Krogan homeworld Tuchanka, as bleak and uninviting as ever.</p> <p>The plot slots beautifully into Mass Effect's structural framework. Shepard soon finds old feuds between alien races are still raging, and so must carry out missions that bring them into the fold, this time with an extra dramatic backdrop provided by the Reaper invasion, as many of the places he visits are full-on war-zones.</p> <p>As Shepard, you get to make momentous decisions that determine which alien races join in with the Alliance effort, so there's diplomacy to be performed when you aren't shooting aliens. Cerberus constantly pop up, throwing whole bags of spanners into the works. The story is full of twists and little subtleties that will delight fans of the series, and those who have never played a Mass Effect game before will be astonished by its depth and richness. The ability to shape parts of it with your actions makes it even more involving.</p> <p>While the basic mechanics of the game haven't been altered \u2013 the wheel that lets you select weapons and powers is the same as ever, for example \u2013 BioWare has indulged in plenty of judicious tweaking. This time around, Shepard is noticeably more mobile and moves in a more fluid way, which is handy in a firefight. The layout of the Normandy has changed (it's back to being an alliance, rather than Cerberus, ship), and the mining mechanic has been abandoned as being irrelevant in the context of a universe-wide war. Instead, the Alliance funds you, which is a lot simpler than fiddling around looking for rare elements. And there are plenty of random missions to be found on planets beset by the Reapers.</p> <p>There's also a co-operative mode for the first time \u2013 having humans rather than AI in your squad is something all Mass Effect players, surely, have craved \u2013 and an almost board game-like iOS app which is all about reclaiming the universe, planet by planet, from the Reapers, and what you do in the single-payer game can feed back into it. Mass Effect always had vast amounts of replay value, and that just adds to it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386937908\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330960884662/Mass-Effect-3-005.jpg\" alt=\"Mass Effect 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mass Effect 3</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than ever, the Mass effect universe pulls off the masterful trick of feeling huge and yet believable \u2013 the game's production values are through the roof, and its third-person shooter controls incredibly precise, responsive and accurate given Mass Effect's immense scope. It really does feel like a TV sci-fi series in which you play the central character \u2013 which highlights the current absence of significant sci-fi series from our TV screens.</p> <p>It's even the first Mass Effect game to let you play as a male Shepard and have gay relationships \u2013 although those are conducted in such a stiff and awkward manner that you don't feel BioWare was particularly comfortable about making them. But at least they show the game's desire to provide a mature form of entertainment which lacks nothing in comparison with Hollywood or television. Show it to the next person who maintains games are vacant and unsophisticated, and watch them squirm as they're forced to acknowledge their ignorance.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Mass Effect 3 was reviewed on the Xbox 360</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Brian Coleman, the famously outspoken London Conservative, has been ruled by a Barnet Council standards sub-committee to have broken the council's members' code of conduct by sending emails calling an Israeli member of the public \"disloyal\" to his own country, and another correspondent that he supposed she would have \"been in the blackshirts,\" 70 years ago, when responding to their concerns about a multinational company which has a commercial contract with Israel. He has been ordered to apologise but reportedly declined as yet to do so, vowing instead to appeal against the decision. For Coleman, a long-standing Barnet councillor, this affair is not about discourtesy of a rather pronounced kind but what he described at his hearing as a \"rising tide\" of antisemitism in the borough. Here's the background. Ron Cohen, the Israeli correspondent, and Dr Charlotte Jago wrote to Coleman in his capacity as Barnet's cabinet member for the environment and one of its representative on the North London Waste Authority asking him to take into account their views about the multinational environmental services company Veolia, whose transport division has constructed a light railway system in Jerusalem. This includes a link to a settlement on disputed land, resulting in Veolia becoming the object of a boycott campaign. The waste authority had invited bids to develop a new waste facility at the Pinkham Way site, which is in Barnet. Veolia already supplies services in London. Coleman, who also sits on the London Assembly representing the constituency of Barnet and Camden and is London mayor Boris Johnson's appointee as chair of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA), had already been judged by an independent investigator, Keith Stevens, who was appointed by Barnet Council, to have broken the conduct code. In his report, delivered last November, Stevens concluded that the complainants' emails to Coleman were \"courteous\" and that they were \"perfectly entitled to send them,\" and that Coleman's replies had, in the case of Cohen, \"crossed the line into deliberate personal, offensive and insulting abuse\" that he \"would have known...would cause hurt and distress to an Israeli\" and, in the case of Jago, been \"rude and personally offensive, unfair and unreasonable, and amounted to an expression of anger and personal, demeaning abuse.\" Stevens, who has served as county secretary and solicitor to Sufollk County Council and senior ethical standards adviser to the Chartererd Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, noted that Coleman, who is a strong supporter of Israel and strident critic of pro-Palestinian campaigns, characterised Jago in his reply to her as \"anti-Zionist\" and \"equated anti-Zionism to anti-Semitism.\" Last April Coleman complained of \"a nasty, unpleasant, organised campaign against Veolia and their possible participation in the NLWA procurement process.\" He said this was \"motivated by anti-Zionist sentiments by some residents of the borough, which in my book amounts to anti-Semitism.\" The report found Coleman to also be in breach of the code of conduct by failing to co-operate with his inquiries. \"The respondent [Coleman] has shown no insight into the effect of his conduct has had, no recognition [and] no contrition,\" Stevens wrote. Complaints by two other Barnet residents who had corresponded with Coleman about Veolia were not upheld by Stevens, though the investigator said it was \"of concern\" that Coleman told one of the unsuccessful complainants, Roger Higginson, that, \"I shall not be taking the slightest notice of your views.\" On Monday the standards sub-committee agreed with Stevens about the Coleman emails. It's not the first time Coleman's breached the code. Two years ago the same conclusion was reached after Coleman sent an email to Barnet resident Roger Tichborne, who writes the Barnet Eye blog, calling him \"an obsessive, poisonous individual,\" and his track record for giving people electronic pieces of his mind was further lengthened last October when it emerged that he'd told a local single mother seeking his help with a housing problem to \"live in the real world.\" Yet Coleman places this latest episode in a different category. \"This isn't just Coleman being Coleman,\" as he put it to me during a phone conversation last year with what I found a quite disarming self-awareness. He made plain then, as before and since, that he believes himself a target of a thoroughly nasty political campaign and is responding accordingly. As Roger Tichborne reports Coleman has secured some passionate backing for this stance, one which might also be understood in the context of the London elections. Coleman's Labour challenger for the Barnet and Camden assembly seat is Andrew Dismore, who was removed as a local MP at the last general election by the tiniest of margins and has been bullish about his chances of unseating Coleman. Dismore's c.v. also includes being a vice chair of Labour Friends of Israel and the driving parliamentary force behind the founding of Holocaust Memorial Day. Barnet contains many Jewish residents, comprising 17.5% of all Jewish Britons in 2001, according to the census of that year. It will be a distinctive and interesting campaign.",

      "bodyText": "Allison Littlejohn, director of the Caledonian Academy, Glasgow Caledonian University Blended learning should transform learning, not just replicate teaching: Companies want graduates who can source, filter and use existing knowledge to create new knowledge, and the university is key to equipping students with these skills. Yet we seldom see technology tools being used in radically new ways in HE. They are usually used to replicate lectures - think of websites or podcasts - rather than enabling students to learn in new ways. Massive Open Online Course is one example of transformational learning. The courses are semi structured, decentralised, and (crucially) open. People contribute via blogs, tweets and a variety of other web 2.0 tools. Students can source and bring together ideas, using hashtags, mashups and a range of technologies. The real power of a MOOC is that people learn together. But it requires a high level of self-regulation and it would seem that students going into universities today are less self-regulated than a decade ago. The relationship between blended learning and digital literacy is important, yet often overlooked: There are few well-defined ideas on how learners make connections across distributed networks and how they chart their learning pathways including a review of how universities are supporting literacy development at http://www.academy.gcal.ac.uk/llida/ and some more ideas at literacyinthedigitaluniversity.blogspot.com The work of Eszter Hargittai at Northwestern and Danah Boyd at Berkley is well worth reading. Learn from industry: There are lots of examples of collaborative and collective learning in industry. For a decade Shell has been pioneering the use of global knowledge networks to help employees solve problems and build new solutions. Here are some ideas we developed with Shell to help knowledge workers improve productivity. Glasgow Caledonian University is now using these approaches and tools to help postgraduate students, PhDs in the UK and Netherlands, learn more effectively. Also see this journal article on Charting collective Knowledge. Other useful examples: \u2022 iSpot, UK Open University - where students, experts and members of the public share ideas on botany \u2022 DIDET, Universities of Strathclyde and Stanford - where engineering students are given a design brief and have to source, use and share knowledge resources while creating their produce design Ben Scoble, learning development specialist, Staffordshire University Experiment with Screencast: Many lecturers I have worked with have found this an amazing tool. They have seen the immediate benefit in recording a lecture (much like a live event) but have it available before and after a workshop or seminar. In terms of value for the student, they have a high quality resource that has many additional benefits. In respect to value for learning, many lecturers have been looking at replacing the lecture with this and finding other experiences to develop where there was once a lecture. In addition, many have also seen an opportunity for pre-workshop 'training' on software or lab equipment before students experience the real world environment. View blended learning as a continuum: So, as an earlier step into blended learning, using virtual learning environments (VLEs) as 'presentation' environments to support traditional delivery is a valid and appropriate approach. The approach matches the confidence and technical skill level of all involved. Beyond this 'presentation' end of the continuum, one must gauge how difficult the transition to online learning activities that enhance or replace the traditional learning experiences will be, and what has been the experiences of others. Technical skill development and learning activity redesign are areas to focus on to then focus on. See this example University of Glamorgan CELT Resources: \u2022 Not all presentations are equal in effectiveness or impact. See the Ferris Bueller example of poor delivery \u2022 Learning ecology, communities and networks: extending the classroom by G. Siemens is worth reading Claudia Megele, senior lecturer and module leader, University of Hertfordshire Understand and address student frustrations: Various research documents students' technical frustrations regarding appropriate ways to utilise web-based material, and depict an inconsistent picture of students understanding. The assumption that students will engage with virtual learning environments (VLE) and web-based components of the course as enthusiastically as their engagement with Twitter or Facebook are misguided. In fact, little attention has been paid to students' non-use of the technological resources available to them. Key stages in blended learning: To tap into the transformational aspects of the new technologies and create a new 'blended reality', we need to do the following: \u2022 Better define the terminologies involved \u2022 Work out what blended learning means to us \u2022 Contextualise blended learning through a transformed course-design \u2022 Take responsibility for learners development \u2022 Engage in networks and communities Timothy Murray, director, Society for the Humanities and curator of the Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art, Cornell University Examples of using technology to enhance learning and collaboration: At the University of Technology Sydney, we combined our students through live Polycom streaming and asked them to work in small units (with students from UTS and Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York) to develop internet art projects addressing technological issues we faced when live streaming was complicated by suddenly slow internet feeds, for example. The students, working together, via digital technologies, enhanced their understanding of the socio-cultural challenges of digital learning itself. We later used the same technology to join colleagues gather on two different continents and very different time zones in a live seminar on 'sound cultures'. Resource: Many projects that have arisen from the HASTAC Digital Media and Learning Competition and its blog that may be of interest. Elizabeth Losh, director, Culture, Art, and Technology program, Sixth College, University of California, San Diego Some of the most effective forms of blended learning are relatively unambitious technically: Writing individual emails to students enrolled in large lecture hall courses to provide meaningful, personalised feedback that addresses each student as a human being can be one of the best ways to enhance learning. Of course, it is really time-consuming. Share failures so we can all learn from them: One problem with technological innovation in education is that there is a real hesitance to tell failure stories. A lot of distance learning and blended learning initiatives are unsuccessful and there are many abandoned initiatives such as universities using Second Life. This isn't to say that we shouldn't be trying lots of new things to make our classrooms more interesting and meaningful places. But it is important to get beyond hype and promote understanding whenever we can, and that understanding should include an honest discussion of the pitfalls of thinking that we can solve the many problems with which the contemporary education system grapples merely with a new website, gadget, or buzzword. Good courses that use online technologies encourage interaction and experimentation not passive consumption. Resource: Check out this group of articles about the so-called 'distraction panic' over laptops and mobile devices in the classroom from The New Everyday. Nitin Parmar, learning technologist, University of Bath Show the benefits of blending learning for staff as well as students: We've been examining the role of a lecture capture platform to support learning and teaching at the University of Bath over the course of the last couple of years. Not only has this proved to be of immense benefit to those students based on campus, but also to those learning at a distance where teaching can be delivered (and later reviewed) in a more engaging way than might have been the case previously. However, academics can be cautious of these tools so learning technologists need to stress the benefits, not just to students, but also to staff. At Bath, publications such as 5 reasons to capture your practice helped us do that. Resource: I'm part of a project team on a JISC-funded projected called Professionalism in the Digital Environment (PriDE) in which we are taking an institution-wide approach to developing digital literacies. David J A Lewis, blended learning manager, University of Glamorgan Resources: \u2022 Continuums of blended learning suggest that technology can enhance any experience, whichever the mode of teaching. See Carole Longden's or Keith Tyler-Smith's blogs \u2022 Aberystwyth has an interesting piece of work on the benefits of capture, undertaken by their psychology department. They have had great success with embedding lecture capture. Brandon Muramatsu, senior educational technology consultant, MIT Office of Educational Innovation and Technology The challenge going forward is moving from monolithic recorded sessions to shorter ones with more focused topics: The last few years have seen YouTube and other systems be able to support seeking to particular point in a video clip (based on time code). From an educational perspective this allows us to pinpoint a start time for a particular concept - either a key topic, or an interesting point. Also, in some of our work we've been experimenting with automatic speech recognition to enable full text search and seek over entire videos. Pam Tatlow, chief executive, million+ Resource: It's worth having a look at the electronic e-portfolio system at the University of Wolverhampton which is designed to increase the support on offer to students, enhance learning and improve professional practice. Students use PebblePad an electronic portfolio system, during their work placements to maintain contact with their peer group and tutors. This e-portfolio allows students to capture their thoughts and experiences immediately and contains spaces for communication with tutors and other students about practical problems (and successes) they experience on placement.

      "bodyText": "Whilst I am appalled at the underhand way in which Liverpool, alone of all the core cities, has had an elected mayor imposed on it by the Labour Party, I am delighted that this government with its Liberal Democrat influence is the first for almost 40 years to place power back in the hands of local councils and through councils local communities. Three major pieces of legislation relating to localism, police and health will place extra powers and finance in the hands of every council in England. In December last year even more power and funding was promised to the eight core cities of England. Not only will this provide better decision-making with the adoption of local priorities rather than national ones; it will also mean more money for some of the most deprived communities in the UK. I am standing in the mayoral election because I believe that only the Liberal Democrats have the long term strategies which will place this city in a leading position, able to create the jobs and investment which this city so badly needs. One has only to look at the achievements of our 12 years in control. In 1998 the only award that Liverpool could have won was First Prize for whingeing. Our services were the third worst in the country; our council tax was 20% higher than the next council; children were poorly served and consistently underperformed any other city in the country; our housing service was rated 'below average' for eight years in a row. Liberal Democrats won the year as European Capital of Culture which brought more than 17,000,000 visitors to the city in 2008. Our council tax fell to about 100th in the national league; at one stage in the mid 00's there was more than \u00a32.5billion of private investment being built in Liverpool city centre at the same time; more than \u00a31 billion of public and private money was brought into Liverpool to deal with outstanding problems in public sector housing; and our educational performance rose to one of the best for urban areas \u2013 and well above the average for core cities. What we have done once we can do again. But to do so, Liverpool needs an encompassing vision and direction that everyone in the city, residents, business and friends can buy into and support. I believe that the big statement for our city must be to make it the greenest city in the country and become the European Green City. In Liverpool we have the intellectual power of our universities; the commercial power of our businesses; the wind, tide, wave and river power of our location. We can make our city the cleanest and greenest in Europe. Doing so will improve our health and create jobs and wealth. We need to change green talk into green actions. Everyone can play a part in 'greening' our city from companies who make and plan green things to housing bodies that can improve insulation; from the third sector with innovative recycling ideas to universities with the power to examine and develop new green solutions. Between now and the elections I will be issuing regular policy updates looking at how the Liberal Democrat councillors and I will work together to deliver a strong confident Liverpool. This is not an election we want to fight but it is an election we will now fight to win. This is an election for a new position with a new voting system and with possibly a new range of candidates from outside the two main Liberal Democrat and Labour parties. No-one knows who will win but we leave no stone unturned to convince the people of Liverpool that this opportunity created by Liberal Democrats should by delivered by Liberal Democrats. The Guardian Northerner is running posts from all Liverpool's Mayoral candidates. You can read Labour candidate Joe Anderson's here.",

But to do so, Liverpool needs an encompassing vision and direction that everyone in the city, residents, business and friends can buy into and support. I believe that the big statement for our city must be to make it the greenest city in the country and become the European Green City.</p> <p>In Liverpool we have the intellectual power of our universities; the commercial power of our businesses; the wind, tide, wave and river power of our location. We can make our city the cleanest and greenest in Europe. Doing so will improve our health and create jobs and wealth. We need to change green talk into green actions. Everyone can play a part in 'greening' our city from companies who make and plan green things to housing bodies that can improve insulation; from the third sector with innovative recycling ideas to universities with the power to examine and develop new green solutions.</p> <p>Between now and the elections I will be issuing regular policy updates looking at how the Liberal Democrat councillors and I will work together to deliver a strong confident Liverpool.</p> <p>This is not an election we want to fight but it is an election we will now fight to win. This is an election for a new position with a new voting system and with possibly a new range of candidates from outside the two main Liberal Democrat and Labour parties. No-one knows who will win but we leave no stone unturned to convince the people of Liverpool that this opportunity created by Liberal Democrats should by delivered by Liberal Democrats.</p> <p><em>The Guardian Northerner is running posts from all Liverpool's Mayoral candidates.

      "bodyText": "Last autumn Lasa took part in an online Q&amp;A on the network on the topic of meeting charities' training needs despite budget cuts. There was a huge amount of interest in this, so we followed it up with some research to establish whether training budget cuts are affecting the sector, and how voluntary sector professionals felt this would affect them and the individuals they support. Cuts to training budgets are taking place in the context of wider cuts to the third sector. In 2011, NCVO estimated that by the end of the parliament an estimated \u00a3911m would be lost from the sector in grants and contracts. Our research, however, reveals that far from training being \"nice to have\", the majority of the 446 charity sector professionals who responded regard it as essential. They are concerned about the impact of cuts in this area, not only on their skills and knowledge, but ultimately on the quality of support and advice they can offer to the people they work with. Main findings Over three quarters (76%) of respondents said that training and professional development was absolutely necessary for their job, with 17% rating it as fairly important. Only 7% said that it was \"nice to have but I don't do much\". \"These results don't surprise us,\" says Jan Burnell, managing director of The Centre, a company that specialises in training charities. \"Our delegates are finding that cuts and redundancies mean that everyone else has to work smarter \u2013 making training even more important as the sector gets leaner and is forced to get more efficient.\" Of those surveyed, 85% said that training helps to \"do my job by providing me with the required knowledge/skills\". Two thirds (66%) say that these resources \"help contribute to the upskilling of my colleagues/team\", 57% that they \"contribute to the difference my charity makes\", and 55% that they \"support the people who my charity helps\". Respondents are telling us loud and clear that the net effect of training is not only to arm charity sector professionals with the right skills and knowledge for the job, but also to contribute to the organisation's mission and purpose. Many organisations are having problems accessing training and learning and development resources. Of those surveyed, 74% said that budget cuts were the main barrier, while more than half (53%) cited lack of time, which is also a result of squeezed resources; according to NCVO, the sector lost 70,000 jobs in 2011. Indeed, almost half (49%) of respondents stated that their charities don't have the budget to train volunteers and staff to support the big society agenda, with a further 34% unsure. The fact that the majority of the sector organisations surveyed do not have or are unsure whether they have the budget to train their people in line with a major government initiative demonstrates the extent of the cuts involved. Charity sector professionals also expressed concern about the probable impact of training budget cuts on the sector in 10 years' time. Of those surveyed, 86% said the quality of support and advice that charities give could deteriorate, while 61% thought that organisations would not be able to help as many people due to a lack of knowledge and skills. Worryingly, 42% thought that not being able to access training about management and governance could affect their charity's sustainability. Jenny Clark, NCVO's research manager says: \"At a time when voluntary sector budgets are being stretched further than ever, these findings reiterate the importance of providing both paid staff and volunteers with opportunities for learning and development, thus ensuring organisations are best able to deliver on their mission and values.\" The results also indicated two other growing trends in the sector. Almost two thirds (64%) of respondents said that their charities used e-learning. Coincidentally, many of the charities we work with have also told us anecdotally that they need a blended learning approach to suit the different learning styles of their staff. Finally, 65% of respondents felt that a minimum number of hours of formal learning and development should be mandatory for charity staff due to the potential impact of charities' work on the vulnerable and wider society. This indicates that professional development is moving up organisational agendas. As these results show, many charity sector professionals see training as vital. Charities are crying out for greater professional development, despite cuts. Now is the moment to have the conversation about how best to resource that. Jan Burnell agrees: \"As management teams take on more responsibility and front-line workers find their workloads increasing all the time, the question is not 'can we afford the training?' but 'given that we've got to make the most of our people - how can we get the best value from our training?'\" Zoe Amar is head of marketing and business development at Lasa.

      "bodyText": "Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, invoked the spectre of Auschwitz as he chided those who question whether Iran is in pursuit of a nuclear weapon and warned that \"none of us can afford to wait much longer\" to act against Tehran. In an address to the powerful pro-Israel lobby in Washington, Netanyahu derided the effectiveness of sanctions hours after a meeting with Barack Obama at which the US president appealed for time for diplomacy to pressure Iran to open up its nuclear programme to inspection. At the strained White House meeting, the Israeli prime minister responded to Obama's demand for an end to \"loose talk of war\" and bluster over Iran by reiterating the Jewish state's \"right to defend itself\". Speaking to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) hours later, Netanyahu questioned the premise of US policy that Iran has not yet made the decision to develop a nuclear weapon. \"Amazingly, some people refuse to acknowledge that Iran's goal is to develop nuclear weapons. You see, Iran claims that it's enriching uranium to develop medical research. Yeah, right,\" he said. \"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then what is it? That's right, it's a duck. But this duck is a nuclear duck and it's time the world started calling a duck a duck. \"Fortunately, President Obama and most world leaders understand that the idea that Iran's goal is not to develop nuclear weapons is ridiculous.\" In fact, Obama has consistently said that US intelligence does not show Iran is working towards a nuclear bomb or has decided to do so. Washington believes that even if Iran decides to develop a nuclear weapon, it is at least a year away from being able to do so. At the White House meeting, the US president again urged that sanctions be given time to work. Netanyahu was dismissive in his speech to Aipac. \"For the last decade, the international community has tried diplomacy. It hasn't worked. For six years, the international community has applied sanctions. That hasn't worked either. I appreciate President Obama's recent efforts to impose even tougher sanctions against Iran. Those sanctions are hurting Iran's economy. But unfortunately, Iran's nuclear march goes on,\" he said. \"Israel has waited patiently for the international community to resolve this issue. We've waited for diplomacy to work. We've waited for sanctions to work. None of us can afford to wait much longer.\" Netanyahu arrived in Washington planning to press Obama to commit to military action against Iran if it crosses specified \"red lines\" in development of its nuclear programme or fails to meet demands to dismantle its underground nuclear facility in Qom and to halt uranium enrichment. US officials say the president did not want to make any such commitment, even though he says the military option remains on the table, out of concern that it will be seen as implicitly endorsing an Israeli attack if the demands are not met. It's not known if Netanyahu pressed the case at his one-on-one session with Obama and the Israeli prime minister told Aipac he wasn't going to discuss it in public. \"I'm not going to talk to you about what Israel will do or will not do. I never talk about that,\" he said. In his own speech to Aipac on Sunday, Obama demanded an end to the \"loose talk of war\" and \"bluster\" against Iran - a clear reference to the noise out of Netanyahu's government. At the same time the US president repeated his reassurance that he \"has Israel's back\". At the White House meeting, Obama spoke of the \"difficult months\" ahead. \"It is profoundly in the United States' interest as well to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"That's why we have worked so diligently to set up the most crippling sanctions ever with respect to Iran. We do believe that there is still a window that allows for a diplomatic resolution to this issue, but ultimately the Iranians' regime has to make a decision to move in that direction, a decision that they have not made thus far. \"My policy is prevention of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons... When I say all options are at the table, I mean it. Having said that, I know that both the prime minister and I prefer to resolve this diplomatically. We understand the costs of any military action.\" But Netanyahu told Aipac: \"There's been plenty of talk recently about the costs of stopping Iran. I think it's time to talk about the costs of not stopping Iran.\" The Israeli prime minister invoked the Holocaust in saying he would not allow Israelis to \"live under the shadow of annihilation\". He said he had in his desk a copy of a letter from the World Jewish Congress asking the US war department to bomb the Auschwitz death camp in 1944. Netanyahu said that in their reply the Americans said that such an operation would require them to divert too many aircraft from other missions and it probably wouldn't succeed. \"And here's the most remarkable sentence of all, and I quote: 'Such an effort might provoke even more vindictive action by the Germans'. Think about that \u2013 'even more vindictive action' - than the Holocaust,\" he said. \"Today we have a state of our own. The purpose of the Jewish state is to secure the Jewish future. That is why Israel must always have the ability to defend itself, by itself, against any threat. We deeply appreciate the great alliance between our two countries. But when it comes to Israel's survival, we must always remain the masters of our fate.\" Netanyahu - who tellingly made no mention of the conflict with the Palestinians, exposing how it has been sidelined by the whipping up of the Iran crisis - was talking to a sympathetic audience of 13,000 Aipac members who loudly cheered and clapped the Israeli leader. But he was also addressing a powerful one. More than half the members of the US Congress were in attendance, a reflection of Aipac's influence on Capitol Hill where it has been a driving force in pressing for stronger sanctions legislation against Iran and upping the rhetoric. The Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, addressed the conference shortly before Netanyahu and backed the Israeli wish to see Obama make an explicit threat of military action against Iran if red lines are crossed, although he did not mention Netanyahu's demands for the dismantling of existing nuclear facilities. McConnell blamed Obama's attempts to engage with the Iranian leadership when he first came to power for allowing Tehran time to develop its nuclear programme, describing the approach as a \"critical flaw\" in policy. He said that Obama is now relying too heavily on sanctions and called for a \"clear declarative policy of what we will do and why\". \"This is the policy I recommend: If Iran at any time begins to enrich uranium to weapons grade levels or decides to go forward with a weapons programme, then the United States would use overwhelming force to end that programme,\" McConnell said to loud cheers and applause and whistles. \"All that's been lacking until now is a clear declarative policy, and if the administration's reluctant for some reason to articulate it then Congress will attempt to do it for them.\"",

None of us can afford to wait much longer.\"</p> <p>Netanyahu arrived in Washington planning to press Obama to commit to military action against Iran if it crosses specified \"red lines\" in development of its nuclear programme or fails to meet demands to dismantle its underground nuclear facility in Qom and to halt uranium enrichment. </p> <p>US officials say the president did not want to make any such commitment, even though he says the military option remains on the table, out of concern that it will be seen as implicitly endorsing an Israeli attack if the demands are not met. </p> <p>It's not known if Netanyahu pressed the case at his one-on-one session with Obama and the Israeli prime minister told Aipac he wasn't going to discuss it in public.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to talk to you about what Israel will do or will not do. I never talk about that,\" he said. </p> <p>In his own speech to Aipac on Sunday, Obama demanded an end to the \"loose talk of war\" and \"bluster\" against Iran - a clear reference to the noise out of Netanyahu's government. At the same time the US president repeated his reassurance that he \"has Israel's back\".</p> <p>At the White House meeting, Obama spoke of the \"difficult months\" ahead.</p> <p>\"It is profoundly in the United States' interest as well to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"That's why we have worked so diligently to set up the most crippling sanctions ever with respect to Iran. We do believe that there is still a window that allows for a diplomatic resolution to this issue, but ultimately the Iranians' regime has to make a decision to move in that direction, a decision that they have not made thus far.</p> <p>\"My policy is prevention of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons... When I say all options are at the table, I mean it. Having said that, I know that both the prime minister and I prefer to resolve this diplomatically. We understand the costs of any military action.\"</p> <p>But Netanyahu told Aipac: \"There's been plenty of talk recently about the costs of stopping Iran. I think it's time to talk about the costs of not stopping Iran.\" </p> <p>The Israeli prime minister invoked the Holocaust in saying he would not allow Israelis to \"live under the shadow of annihilation\". He said he had in his desk a copy of a letter from the World Jewish Congress asking the US war department to bomb the Auschwitz death camp in 1944. </p> <p>Netanyahu said that in their reply the Americans said that such an operation would require them to divert too many aircraft from other missions and it probably wouldn't succeed. </p> <p>\"And here's the most remarkable sentence of all, and I quote: 'Such an effort might provoke even more vindictive action by the Germans'. Think about that \u2013 'even more vindictive action' - than the Holocaust,\" he said. \"Today we have a state of our own. The purpose of the Jewish state is to secure the Jewish future. That is why Israel must always have the ability to defend itself, by itself, against any threat. We deeply appreciate the great alliance between our two countries. But when it comes to Israel's survival, we must always remain the masters of our fate.\"</p> <p>Netanyahu - who tellingly made no mention of the conflict with the Palestinians, exposing how it has been sidelined by the whipping up of the Iran crisis - was talking to a sympathetic audience of 13,000 Aipac members who loudly cheered and clapped the Israeli leader. But he was also addressing a powerful one. </p> <p>More than half the members of the US Congress were in attendance, a reflection of Aipac's influence on Capitol Hill where it has been a driving force in pressing for stronger sanctions legislation against Iran and upping the rhetoric. </p> <p>The Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, addressed the conference shortly before Netanyahu and backed the Israeli wish to see Obama make an explicit threat of military action against Iran if red lines are crossed, although he did not mention Netanyahu's demands for the dismantling of existing nuclear facilities.</p> <p>McConnell blamed Obama's attempts to engage with the Iranian leadership when he first came to power for allowing Tehran time to develop its nuclear programme, describing the approach as a \"critical flaw\" in policy. </p> <p>He said that Obama is now relying too heavily on sanctions and called for a \"clear declarative policy of what we will do and why\".</p> <p>\"This is the policy I recommend: If Iran at any time begins to enrich uranium to weapons grade levels or decides to go forward with a weapons programme, then the United States would use overwhelming force to end that programme,\" McConnell said to loud cheers and applause and whistles. </p> <p>\"All that's been lacking until now is a clear declarative policy, and if the administration's reluctant for some reason to articulate it then Congress will attempt to do it for them.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Up to 30,000 prisoners leaving jail each year, who then claim jobseeker's allowance (JSA), will be referred immediately to the government's Work Programme, and lose benefit if they refuse to cooperate, the employment minister, Chris Grayling, announced on Tuesday. Grayling will argue that the measure is designed to reduce reoffending. Jobcentre Plus staff will process benefit claims in prison speeding up the process, making immediate referral to the Work Programme. At present most claimants are not referred to the Work Programme until they have been on benefits for nine to 12 months. The Ministry of Justice will also set up payments by results system for former prisoners so that employers will be paid according to number of ex-offenders recruited. Work Programme participants will receive a fee of \u00a35,600 if they succeed in placing a former offender into work, and help them stay in employment for more than two years. Employers will be expected to start providing guidance about job opportunities to prisoners while they are in custody in preparation for release. Figures compiled by the two departments for England and Wales, showed that one third of all of those claiming jobseeker's allowance have criminal records, with 28% on employment support allowance, the benefit for the sick and disabled. Nearly three-quarters of offenders claimed an out of work benefit within two years of leaving prison. A total of 30,000 former prisoners are claiming JSA within three months of leaving prison. Government research shows offenders claiming JSA on release from prison in 2008 spent 40% more time on benefits over the next three years than the average claimant. Grayling said:\"Getting former offenders into work is absolutely crucial to tackling our crime challenge. The rate of reoffending in Britain is far too high, and we have to reduce it. In the past we just sent people out onto the same streets where they offended in the first place with virtually no money and very little support.\"",

      "bodyText": "He has gone down in history as the man who cracked the Enigma code, changing the course of the second world war, and whose work in mathematics and computer sciences was instrumental in bringing about the personal computers we use today. Yet a new exhibition at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, Britain's centre of codebreaking activities in the second world war, reveals another side to Alan Turing. A collection of his personal possessions, donated by his family, includes a teddy bear that he bought as a student and named Porgy; an unread copy of Arabian Nights, which Turing won at school; and a treasured Swiss watch. More poignantly, it also includes a biography of Turing by his mother Sara, which she self-published in 1959 after every publisher had turned it down; and a letter sent to her in 1975 by computer scientist Brian Randell, which revealed to her the extent of Turing's heroism. As head of Hut 8, the naval Enigma team, Turing's work at Bletchley Park had been top secret and was not disclosed until the mid-70s. Winston Churchill called the place, which employed up 10,000 people at the height of its operations, \"the goose that laid the golden egg and never cackled\". \"That's how the secret was kept \u2013 people respected their superior officers,\" said Jean Valentine, who worked on the Enigma machine at Bletchley Hall as a 19-year-old, and now works as a guide there. \"You didn't mention a word even to your contemporaries.\" In 1952, Turing was arrested for having a sexual relationship with another man, convicted for gross indecency and chemically castrated. He committed suicide two years later, aged 41. At the launch of the exhibition, called The Life and Works of Alan Turing, Captain Jerry Roberts, a fellow codebreaker at Bletchley, said that Turing \"saved the nation and demands the highest recognition\". He added that once the Enigma code had been cracked, the number of allied battleships sunk by the Nazis dropped by 75%. In 2009, Gordon Brown issued an official apology for Turing's treatment by the British government, a signed copy of which is including in the exhibition. However, a campaign to have Turing officially pardoned was rejected by justice minister Lord McNally last month. \"I think it's enormously regrettable \u2013 he ought to be pardoned,\" said former culture secretary Chris Smith at the launch of the exhibition. \"This country treated him outrageously and we should be honouring him by removing any stain from his record, his character, his history and saying that we got it wrong \u2013 he didn't.\" William Newman, the son of Turing's mentor, Prof Max Newman, remembered Turing as \"a lovely man\", who became a \"part-time member\" of their family after the war, when Newman and Turing worked together at Manchester University. \"He was good friends with me and my brother \u2013 he would think very hard about Christmas presents.\" Turing was a keen athlete who would sometimes run the eight miles from his house to the Newmans's. \"One morning I head this noise. He wanted to invite us to supper but it was 6am, so he didn't feel he could knock on the door. He'd taken a leaf off a rhodedendron bush and he was scratching the invitation on that. He could improvise solutions to things so well.\" The exhibition includes a selection of Turing's papers from the Turing-Newman collaboration collection, including the pioneering 1950 article about artificial intelligence in which he posed the question \"Can machines think?\" The collection was saved for the nation last year thanks to contributions from a variety of donors including the National Heritage Memorial Fund and Google, who gave $100,000 (\u00a362,986). The Turing exhibition was opened by James May, one of the presenters of the BBC show Top Gear, who said that finding out about Turing's work was important for the understanding of computer sciences. The launch was attended by members of Turing's family including his nephew, John, and by judges of the Art Fund prize for museum of the year. Bletchley Park is one of 10 British museums competing for the \u00a3100,000 prize, which will be awarded on 19 June.",

      "bodyText": "Rock star Roger Waters has moved to soften his remarks on the Falklands Islands' ownership, posting on Facebook that he never stated categorically they belong to Argentina. The former Pink Floyd bass player wrote that he had been misquoted in the Argentinian press from a press conference - but the Facebook posting does not address remarks he made separately to Chilean TV that he thought the Falklands \"should be Argentine\". Waters arrived on Monday in Buenos Aires, where he will perform nine sold-out shows at the River Plate football stadium to an estimated 400,000 fans over the next two weeks. He is slated to meet President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner at the Casa Rosada presidential palace on Tuesday before his first show on Wednesday. In an interview transmitted by the Chilean channel TVN last Thursday, Waters was asked: \"Falklands, Malvinas, what is your take? Is it British or is it Argentine?\" Waters gave his opinion: \"I think it should be Argentine.\" The interview came on the heels of similar statements by the American actor Sean Penn in Buenos Aires and just before British singer Morrissey told a packed stadium in the central Argentinian city of C\u00f3rdoba that \"everyone knows they [the Falklands] belong to Argentina\". The statements by all three caused a stir against the backdrop of rising diplomatic tension between Argentina and Britain in the buildup to the 30th anniversary of the 1982 war between the two countries. Unlike Morrissey, Waters did not state as fact that the islands belong to Argentina, but said he thought they \"should\" in the exclusive TVN Chile interview. That interview went round the world and was carried out entirely in English, with an English-speaking Chilean journalist. But Waters in his Facebook post attributed the confusion to a separate \"press conference in Santiago, Chile, where I answered questions for over an hour. As I speak no Spanish my answers were translated by an interpreter. \"A journalist from Argentina misunderstood me and wrote a news piece in an Argentine paper quoting me as stating categorically that the islands belong to Argentina. I said nothing of the kind.\" In the actual interviews Waters qualified his remarks by saying it was a complicated situation and the Falkland Islanders should have a say. In the Facebook posting, Waters goes on to state his position regarding the Falklands, reviewing their history since they were first sighted by European navigators five centuries ago. \"The islands existed uninhabited for millions of years before the 16th century and will probably survive the extinction of the human race for millions more,\" Waters says. \"The tragedy of 1982, when 900 young lives were lost was that it was caused by the folly of two political leaders, Galtieri and Thatcher, who were both losing their grip on the reins of power and used the conflict as a distraction.\" He goes on to say that \"it was described at the time by a Chilean commentator as being like 'two bald men fighting over a comb',\" misattributing the quote, which is from a poem by Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges. The former Pink Floyd bass player goes on to say that \"thirty years later the sound of sabres rattling is rising again. I am not a politician or a diplomat, and have no ready solution, but I am convinced it's time to sue for peace and seek a compromise, not push for victory. At the end of the day what really matters is that not one more drop of blood is shed on the altar of the imperial aspirations of long dead kings.\"",

Is it British or is it Argentine?\" Waters gave his opinion: \"I think it should be Argentine.\"</p> <p>The interview came on the heels of similar statements by the American actor Sean Penn in Buenos Aires and just before British singer Morrissey <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/02/falkland-islands-belong-argentina-morrissey\" title=\"\">told a packed stadium in the central Argentinian city of C\u00f3rdoba that \"everyone knows they [the Falklands] belong to Argentina\"</a>.</p> <p>The statements by all three caused a stir against the backdrop of rising diplomatic tension between Argentina and Britain in the buildup to the 30th anniversary of the 1982 war between the two countries.</p> <p>Unlike Morrissey, Waters did not state as fact that the islands belong to Argentina, but said he thought they \"should\" in the exclusive TVN Chile interview.</p> <p>That interview went round the world and was carried out entirely in English, with an English-speaking Chilean journalist. But Waters in his Facebook post attributed the confusion to a separate \"press conference in Santiago, Chile, where I answered questions for over an hour. As I speak no Spanish my answers were translated by an interpreter.</p> <p>\"A journalist from Argentina misunderstood me and wrote a news piece in an Argentine paper quoting me as stating categorically that the islands belong to Argentina. I said nothing of the kind.\"</p> <p>In the actual interviews Waters qualified his remarks by saying it was a complicated situation and the Falkland Islanders should have a say.</p> <p>In the Facebook posting, Waters goes on to state his position regarding the Falklands, reviewing their history since they were first sighted by European navigators five centuries ago. \"The islands existed uninhabited for millions of years before the 16th century and will probably survive the extinction of the human race for millions more,\" Waters says.</p> <p>\"The tragedy of 1982, when 900 young lives were lost was that it was caused by the folly of two political leaders, Galtieri and Thatcher, who were both losing their grip on the reins of power and used the conflict as a distraction.\"</p> <p>He goes on to say that \"it was described at the time by a Chilean commentator as being like 'two bald men fighting over a comb',\" misattributing the quote, which is from a poem by Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges.</p> <p>The former Pink Floyd bass player goes on to say that \"thirty years later the sound of sabres rattling is rising again. I am not a politician or a diplomat, and have no ready solution, but I am convinced it's time to sue for peace and seek a compromise, not push for victory. At the end of the day what really matters is that not one more drop of blood is shed on the altar of the imperial aspirations of long dead kings.\"</p>",

In NSW alone \u2013 Australia's most populous state \u2013 an area the size of France is either under water or at risk of going under, after 16 river systems have flooded. Southeast Queensland and northern Victoria also face serious threats of flooding. \"This is devastating for small businesses, for farmers and for those whose houses have been flooded,\" said NSW state premier, Barry O'Farrell, who toured the state's affected region. Attention has focused on the NSW town of Wagga Wagga, 475km south west of Sydney, as it faces its biggest flood in 150 years. Around 9,000 residents have been evacuated from the city centre amid fears the town's levee banks may not withstand the flood coming down the Murrumbidgee river. It brings to 13,000 the number of people evacuated from their homes across the state. The levee surrounding Wagga Wagga is 11m high and the river is expected to peak at 10.9m later on Tuesday. It's NSW's biggest inland city with 50,000 residents and it is an important agricultural, military and transport hub. Residents have been filling sandbags to protect their properties and businesses. Two hundred and fifty homes on the north of the city have already been inundated. \"This is a very significant flood emergency and will continue to be a significant flood emergency down stream in the coming weeks,\" said James McTavish of the State Emergency Services. Authorities have pleaded with residents to heed evacuation requests and to stay away from floodwaters. The president of the NSW Farmers Association, Fiona Simson, said the floods will have a massive impact on rural communities. \"Not least because we know the government hasn't got a lot of money,\" she told the Sydney Morning Herald. The state government says it expects the bill for repairing roads alone will come to at least A$500m (\u00a3335m). Rising floodwaters in southeast Queensland are also threatening properties. More than 200mm of rain fell in 24 hours in some areas this week. An 82-year-old man died in the town of Gympie, about 175km north of Brisbane on Monday after his car was caught in rising floodwaters. The deluge in southeast Queensland follows earlier flood emergencies in the state's inland areas, including the state's biggest emergency evacuation in the town of St George in February. The huge amount of rainfall is being attributed to the La Nina phenomenon where the sea surface temperature across the equatorial Eastern Central Pacific Ocean falls lower than normal by three to five degrees celsius. It has meant NSW has had the ninth wettest and fourth coldest summer on record.",

      "bodyText": "The Labour leader Ed Miliband will become an unlikely flag waving champion of British business on Tuesday by calling for a more prominent standard Made in Britain label on all British products. In a speech to the Engineering Employers Federation, setting out Labour's industry policy Miliband will say: \"There are three words we do not hear enough. Those three words are 'Made in Britain'.\" Miliband said he was supporting the Made in Britain initiative launched a year ago by Stoves, the last British manufacturer of cookers. Miliband will say: \"This is not about a backward-looking Buy British campaign. This is not about making consumers feel bad if they don't buy products from British business, it's about something else. We cannot recognise or celebrate our strength in manufacturing unless we know what is designed invented or made here.\" His remarks are reminiscent of the \"I'm Backing Britain\" campaign adopted by Harold Wilson as prime minister in 1968. That campaign started spontaneously when five Surbiton secretaries volunteered to work an extra half an hour each day without pay in order to boost productivity, and urged the rest of the country to follow their initiative, prompting \"I'm backing Britain\" stickers and badges across the country in a post World Cup wave of patriotism. Miliband will claim the government has been silent on the Stoves campaign for more than a year. \"There should be a standard Made in Britain mark that is backed not just by industry but backed by government. We need more pride and patriotism in our industry in our inventors designers and our makers.\" Stoves launched a competition to invent a new Made in Britain marque after it found general confusion amongst consumers about whether products were British made. Survey findings revealed that half of UK consumers are baffled when it comes to buying 'British', two-thirds (67%) want an official seal of approval to show products made in Britain and the majority (52%) think British brands should bring manufacturing back to the UK. Miliband will also accuse the education secretary Michael Gove of downgrading the engineering diploma in schools from one that was worth five GCSEs to just one. \"What signal does that send to young people thinking what they might do in the world?\" he will say. \"The people at the top do not regard this as a proper subject or as a proper qualification. The British engineering sector needs to recruit an extra 2.5m engineers over the next 10 years. How can we do that when we have this snobbery getting in the way?\" He will also admit that too often in the past the Labour government mistook industrial activism as form of dangerous protectionism. In a reference to the bulk of the Labour industrial policy he will say: \"Governments underestimated the extent to which we need pride and patriotism \u2013 infusing everything from government to culture if British business is to succeed.\" He will insist \"government should stop feeling embarrassed about the need for more patriotism in our economic policy. It is patriotic to have an active government using all means at its disposal to give competitive British firms every chance to succeed.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2012. The original wrongly attributed the Made in Britain campaign to Stoves and Co. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "Stefano Pilati, who exited the Paris fashion week stage on Monday after a swansong show that brought 10 years designing for Yves Saint Laurent to a close, summed up better than anyone the almost insurmountable challenge of the job which he leaves tantalising vacant. \"Saint Laurent is maybe the most complex brand in the fashion system,\" he said recently. \"Because you have to face people's imagination, which is infinite, just as infinite as Yves's work was.\" Following in the footsteps of a fashion legend who brought the influences of vintage, menswear and streetstyle onto the Paris catwalks was not easy. \"Saint Laurent did everything,\" Pilati told the New York Times six years ago. \"You go to the archives and you feel he thought of any idea I could ever imagine. It's intimidating.\" Before his death in 2008, Yves Saint Laurent said of Pilati that \"some of what he does is good, some of it is not so good\". It was a subtly damning indictment, in an industry where anything less than hyperbole is faint praise indeed. Pilati is well liked and respected in the fashion industry, but his tenure at Yves Saint Laurent, while by no means a disaster, is likely to be remembered as falling short of triumphant. Pilati's departure was announced in a coolly polite notice from YSL headquarters, thanking him for being \"instrumental in the rebuilding and repositioning of an iconic French luxury brand. Under Stefano's guiding vision and artistic direction, the house has become a contemporary reference in high fashion\". YSL owners Gucci Group have material reason to be pleased with Pilati's tenure which, thanks in part to commercial successes such as the Muse handbag and the Tribute shoe, saw the YSL label turn from loss-making to profit. In contrast to the emotional final bow of Raf Simons, who made a teary appearance on the Milan catwalk last week after being dismissed from Jil Sander, Pilati was composed and smiling as he showed his collection of uncompromisingly hard-edged chic, with chainmail dresses and narrow silhouettes. Persistent rumours that cult menswear designer Hedi Slimane will be Pilati's successor are as yet unconfirmed. A fortnight after a cameo appearance at London fashion week, Stella McCartney was back in her usual slot on the Paris schedule to present her autumn 2012 line, which drew fabrics from an English country house wardrobe and cut them into the sports-influenced silhouette of modern city dressing. A sensible tweed coat in soft, heathery tones was updated with a blue-and-white ribbed collar of the type found on baseball jackets, and felted Aran-stitch sweater dresses and skirt suits were moulded into an exaggerated hourglass shape at the hips \u2013 a wintry take on McCartney's ever-popular hourglass-shaped cocktail dresses. The singer Alicia Keys became the latest celebrity to showcase what has become a signature look for the designer, wearing a trompe l'oeil hourglass dress in the front row. Stella McCartney's Paris show \u2013 in pictures \"The language of sport is always part of my look,\" said McCartney, rolling her eyes at suggestions of a direct link with this summer's Olympics. But the sports influence, always present in a McCartney show, was noticeably more front-and-centre than in recent seasons. Turtleneck sweaters had wetsuit-style panels around the torso and heavy-duty plastic zips to the nape, while all the models \u2013 and the designer herself \u2013 wore their hair in gymnasts' buns.",

Pilati is well liked and respected in the fashion industry, but his tenure at Yves Saint Laurent, while by no means a disaster, is likely to be remembered as falling short of triumphant.</p> <p>Pilati's departure was announced in a coolly polite notice from YSL headquarters, thanking him for being \"instrumental in the rebuilding and repositioning of an iconic French luxury brand. Under Stefano's guiding vision and artistic direction, the house has become a contemporary reference in high fashion\". YSL owners Gucci Group have material reason to be pleased with Pilati's tenure which, thanks in part to commercial successes such as the Muse handbag and the Tribute shoe, saw the YSL label turn from loss-making to profit.</p> <p>In contrast to the emotional final bow of Raf Simons, who made a teary appearance on the Milan catwalk last week after being dismissed from Jil Sander, Pilati was composed and smiling as he showed his collection of uncompromisingly hard-edged chic, with chainmail dresses and narrow silhouettes. Persistent rumours that cult menswear designer Hedi Slimane will be Pilati's successor are as yet unconfirmed.</p> <p>A fortnight after a cameo appearance at London fashion week, Stella McCartney was back in her usual slot on the Paris schedule to present her autumn 2012 line, which drew fabrics from an English country house wardrobe and cut them into the sports-influenced silhouette of modern city dressing.</p> <p>A sensible tweed coat in soft, heathery tones was updated with a blue-and-white ribbed collar of the type found on baseball jackets, and felted Aran-stitch sweater dresses and skirt suits were moulded into an exaggerated hourglass shape at the hips \u2013 a wintry take on McCartney's ever-popular hourglass-shaped cocktail dresses. The singer Alicia Keys became the latest celebrity to showcase what has become a signature look for the designer, wearing a trompe l'oeil hourglass dress in the front row.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2012/mar/05/stalla-mccartney-paris-fashion-week-2012\" title=\"\">Stella McCartney's Paris show \u2013 in pictures</a></p> <p>\"The language of sport is always part of my look,\" said McCartney, rolling her eyes at suggestions of a direct link with this summer's Olympics. But the sports influence, always present in a McCartney show, was noticeably more front-and-centre than in recent seasons. Turtleneck sweaters had wetsuit-style panels around the torso and heavy-duty plastic zips to the nape, while all the models \u2013 and the designer herself \u2013 wore their hair in gymnasts' buns.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A retired British businessman who was extradited to the US over allegations of arms dealing has been denied bail as he awaits trial, after he was deemed to be a flight risk. Christopher Tappin, 65, from Orpington in Kent, must remain in custody following the ruling by Judge Robert Castaneda, who was told by US prosecutors at a federal court in El Paso, Texas, that he may be a \"danger to the community\" if released. The judge agreed that measures could be imposed to ensure Tappin is monitored if released, but he said a discrepancy in Tappin's financial statement led to him being denied bail. Elaine Tappin said it was an outrage that her husband has been refused bail, adding that he has spent 23 hours a day locked in his cell at the Otero County detention centre in New Mexico since his extradition. \"He's a man of his word and is certainly not at risk of fleeing \u2013 where would he go?\" she asked. \"He doesn't have his passport or access to money. Why has the British government allowed him to be incarcerated in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day before he's even been tried? Tappin, who lost his two-year battle against extradition to the US two weeks ago, will go to trial before a US District Judge in El Paso, Texas, but no date has been set. He denies attempting to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles which were to be shipped from the US to Tehran via the Netherlands. The president of the Kent golf union, who faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted, was escorted into the courtroom on Friday wearing an orange-red prison jumpsuit, with his feet and one hand shackled. US marshals allowed the other hand to remain free so he could use a cane he needs to walk. Assistant US attorney Greg McDonald asked the judge to keep Tappin in jail for the remainder of the proceedings. \"The risk is not that he'll punch somebody in the face, but through the use of a computer and the knowledge he has, he might pose a danger to the community,\" McDonald said. Tappin has no ties to the US and failed to disclose to court officials his frequent travels to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and South Africa, he added. But Kent Schaffer, representing Tappin, said if released, his client would have complied with any restrictions imposed by the court and his family was ready to post bail of $50,000 (\u00a331,600).",

      "bodyText": "The contrast in emotions with Rebecca Adlington was stark but the result was the same for another of Britain's Olympic medal hopes as Liam Tancock sealed his place for this summer's Games with victory in the men's 100m backstroke final on Monday night. While Adlington was a picture of unadulterated joy following her gold medal in the women's 400m freestyle, Tancock declined to get carried away after comfortably coming home in 53.16sec on day three of the British Championships, a little over his British record time of 52.73 sec. \"I'm really pleased but it was about coming here, doing a job and making the Olympics,\" said the 26-year-old. \"I'm a pretty calm guy and that's how I swim. But it's also about looking at the bigger picture; this is a stepping stone towards the Games, obviously a big one, but a stepping stone nevertheless.\" The hard work, then, has paid off for Tancock, who as part of his preparations for the final was made to push the car of his coach, Ben Titley, up a hill during a team cross-training session in Derbyshire last month. It was an exercise designed to improve Tancock's endurance and make him capable of transferring his excellent abilities at 50m backstroke, where he is the world record holder and a two-time world champion, over a longer distance, a necessary requirement given the absence of the 50m backstroke at this summer's Games. Stronger and determined, he can look forward to a return to this venue later this year. \"I love the pool and it felt fantastic to have finally got the chance to swim here,\" said Tancock, who had to overcome seven swimmers who had all recorded their personal bests in qualifying for the final. \"It's going to be even more incredible come the Olympics.\" Gemma Spofforth also sealed her place in Team GB with gold in the women's 100m backstroke final. The 2009 world champion came home in a time of 1min 0.19sec, kicking hard in the final 10m having been fifth at the turn. The 24-year-old was ebullient after her win, which she feels will help her move on from what was a traumatic 2011, a year in which Spofforth's father lost his partner to cancer and the swimmer failed to make it past the heats of the world championships in Shanghai. She also suffered a broken nose in a cycling accident. \"I've had my ups and downs and there have been times when I wondered whether I had the strength to come back,\" said Spofforth, who finished just outside the medals in Beijing four years ago. \"But I've always tried to overcome adversity and for me it comes down to those last 10m and trying to finish stronger than everyone else. If I hadn't qualified [for the Olympics], that probably would have been it for me; this would have been my last race. I'm delighted to have made it.\" The Welsh swimmer Georgia Davies finished second to qualify alongside Spofforth but there was disappointment for Lizzie Simmonds, the European silver medallist, who did not secure a place at the Games after finishing third in 1min 0.43sec. The 21-year-old will, however, return for Thursday's semi-finals of the 200m backstroke, an event she has always felt represented her best chance of making the Olympics having won gold in the event at the 2010 European Championships. Elsewhere in front of an enthusiastic 2,000-strong crowd, the Commonwealth gold medallist Robert Renwick was victorious in the men's 200m freestyle final in 1:47.33. It was the 23-year-old's second win at these championships, which are doubling as a test event for the 17,000-capacity Aquatics Centre, following his triumph in Saturday's 400m freestyle final. He will compete in both disciplines at the Games. In the women's 100m breaststroke final Kate Haywood won in 1:8.07 to seal her Olympic place but there was a shock as the top seed, Sophie Allen, finished third and failed to qualify.",

      "bodyText": "One of the NHS's worst-performing IT contractors has announced that it has reached a deal with the government that could allow the company to retain \u00a31bn in health contracts. The Department of Health (DoH) announced last year that a \u00a31.4bn national IT programme, started in 2002 under Labour, was to be scrapped because it was \"not fit to provide the modern IT services that the NHS needs\". But it remained in negotiations with the US group Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) over a \u00a33bn agreement to install IT systems in the Midlands, north and east of England. CSC said on Monday that it had \"agreed to a set of high-level principles, which are intended to be reflected in a binding interim agreement\" with the DoH. The Wall Street-listed company added that it was \"reasonably possible\" that such an agreement could allow it to recover some of the $1.5bn (\u00a3944m) it wrote off late last year amid uncertainty about the deal. CSC admitted in December that eight years of delays and setbacks on its disastrous NHS contract had left little or no value for shareholders, as the company prepared to write off almost \u00a31bn.

      "bodyText": "His showdown with Richard Nixon became a hit play, an Oscar-nominated film and was voted the greatest broadcast interview of all time. But Sir David Frost has said he is most proud of a less well-remembered interview with a different US president \u2013 George Bush Snr. Frost scooped the first broadcast interview with Bush following his inauguration into the White House in 1989 in a wood cabin on his home estate in Maine. \"It's when you get something from a person who everybody told you would not give at all,\" Frost told the Radio Times when asked about his proudest interview moment. \"A man I greatly respect, the first President Bush \u2013 well, everybody had said that he never relaxed on television and when we did the first interview with him up at Kennebunkport, a little village in Maine \u2026 Although we'd never met before, within 10 or 15 minutes he was talking just so frankly about his family and the daughter he lost through leukaemia,\" said Frost. \"He was direct and everything that he is in real life, but he'd never been seen that way on television.\" The story of how Frost persuaded Nixon to speak on camera in the 1977 series of interviews in which the disgraced former president admitted he \"let down the country\" became the basis of Peter Morgan's play Frost/Nixon. It was later made into a film starring Michael Sheen and Frank Langella. With Frost/Bush an unlikely project for either stage or screen, Frost said he did not mind the perception that the Nixon interview had eclipsed his other work. \"No, one wouldn't worry about it eclipsing anything,\" he told the magazine. \"It was such a great experience that I wouldn't have wanted to be without that in my life.\" Frost, who currently presents the talkshow Frost Over The World on al-Jazeera, will front a new series about the art of the televised interview, Frost on Interviews, on BBC4. It will feature interviews with Michael Parkinson, Lord Bragg, Joan Bakewell and Graham Norton. Frost's own softly, softly approach to interviewing was once described by the late Labour leader John Smith (to Frost himself) as a \"way of asking beguiling questions with potentially lethal consequences\". \"If you don't have the smoking gun then it's pointless to hector interviewees,\" Frost has previously said. \"Because you just shut people up instead of opening them up.\" Asked whether any questions should ever be off-limits because of their personal nature, Frost told the Radio Times: \"It's an interesting point. With the Nixon interview, for instance, I had insisted on sole control \u2013 that he wouldn't know any of the questions in advance and so there was absolutely no legal barrier to me asking him whatever I wanted.\"",

      "body": "<p>His showdown with Richard Nixon became a hit play, an Oscar-nominated film and was voted the greatest broadcast interview of all time. But Sir David Frost has said he is most proud of a less well-remembered interview with a different US president \u2013 George Bush Snr.</p> <p>Frost scooped the first broadcast interview with Bush following his inauguration into the White House in 1989 in a wood cabin on his home estate in Maine.</p> <p>\"It's when you get something from a person who everybody told you would not give at all,\" Frost told the <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/\" title=\"\">Radio Times</a> when asked about his proudest interview moment.</p> <p>\"A man I greatly respect, the first President Bush \u2013 well, everybody had said that he never relaxed on television and when we did the first interview with him up at Kennebunkport, a little village in Maine \u2026 Although we'd never met before, within 10 or 15 minutes he was talking just so frankly about his family and the daughter he lost through leukaemia,\" said Frost. \"He was direct and everything that he is in real life, but he'd never been seen that way on television.\"</p> <p>The story of how Frost persuaded Nixon to speak on camera in the 1977 series of interviews in which the disgraced former president admitted he \"let down the country\" became the basis of Peter Morgan's play Frost/Nixon. It was later made into a film starring Michael Sheen and Frank Langella.</p> <p>With Frost/Bush an unlikely project for either stage or screen, Frost said he did not mind the perception that the Nixon interview had eclipsed his other work. \"No, one wouldn't worry about it eclipsing anything,\" he told the magazine. \"It was such a great experience that I wouldn't have wanted to be without that in my life.\"</p> <p>Frost, who currently presents the talkshow Frost Over The World on al-Jazeera, will front a new series about the art of the televised interview, Frost on Interviews, on BBC4. It will feature interviews with Michael Parkinson, Lord Bragg, Joan Bakewell and Graham Norton.</p> <p>Frost's own softly, softly approach to interviewing was once described by the late Labour leader John Smith (to Frost himself) as a \"way of asking beguiling questions with potentially lethal consequences\".</p> <p>\"If you don't have the smoking gun then it's pointless to hector interviewees,\" Frost has previously said. \"Because you just shut people up instead of opening them up.\"</p> <p>Asked whether any questions should ever be off-limits because of their personal nature, Frost told the Radio Times: \"It's an interesting point. With the Nixon interview, for instance, I had insisted on sole control \u2013 that he wouldn't know any of the questions in advance and so there was absolutely no legal barrier to me asking him whatever I wanted.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez has become the first high-profile candidate to declare an interest in the vacant Chelsea manager's position and suggested he would be forgiven by Liverpool supporters if he were to return to the Premier League at Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea hierarchy are scrutinising their options after dismissing Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas on Sunday a little over eight months into a three-year contract, with the London club fifth in the Premier League and risking a failure to qualify for the Champions League for the first time under Roman Abramovich's stewardship. The owner is to sound out Barcelona's Pep Guardiola, whom he regards as his ideal appointment, and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Real Madrid to ascertain if either would be willing to take over in the summer. Yet, although their futures in La Liga are in some doubt, there is an acknowledgement at Chelsea that negotiating either manager's smooth passage to London would be complicated and costly \u2013 even for a club who have paid \u00a364m and counting in compensation to clubs and managers over the past five years \u2013 with that reality offering hope to other contenders. The merits of Borussia Dortmund's J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Tottenham's Harry Redknapp and Germany's Joachim L\u00f6w will be discussed, and Ben\u00edtez, whose Liverpool enjoyed a fierce rivalry with Chelsea, particularly during the Mourinho era, will cling to the fact that he was tentatively approached last month over the possibility of taking up the reins on a short-term basis until the summer. The Spaniard rejected that scenario, insisting on at least an 18-month arrangement, with Chelsea's interest having cooled significantly since. Yet the former Internazionale manager pushed his own case for consideration on Monday night in the belief that he would not fracture his relationship with fans on Merseyside in the process. \"Can anybody argue [against the fact] that the Liverpool fans love me? No,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"If we agree with this, what do you want for somebody who you love? The best for him. I cannot be waiting at home for five years. Everybody understands that I will need a job. \"If they want me to have the best, they can say you can manage a team at the bottom of the table or manage a team at a top of the table and try to win trophies. That is my idea, to have the option of a top side and try to win trophies. If they love me, they will understand. \"I have had two or three offers from clubs and one from a national team. I want to win trophies; it's not just a case of wanting a job and having some money. It has to be something. They have now Roberto Di Matteo in [temporary] charge, and I have to respect the manager in charge. I have to wait and [see] if something happens in the future. As a manager with experience in the Champions League, in Spain and in Italy, I am open to offers.\" Whether Chelsea fans would accept his appointment is open to some doubt and an offer is likely only if the hierarchy's principal targets are deflected \u2013 Sven-Goran Eriksson also put forward his own name last night but is not a candidate \u2013 with one of Abramovich's former managers, Luiz Felipe Scolari, having warned that whoever takes the position will face a daunting challenge. \"Villas-Boas was a champion and he will continue to be,\" said Scolari. \"He needed to replace at least seven or eight players [players who had been at the club] even since I was there, but he failed. It will be hell for whoever succeeds him.\" Abramovich is seeking a sixth permanent manager in under five years yet Ben\u00edtez, who succeeded Mourinho at Internazionale but was sacked after less than six months, would have no qualms working for \"one of the new owners in football who are investing big money\". Perhaps more significantly, Ben\u00edtez claimed Fernando Torres \u2013 Chelsea's underperforming \u00a350m British record signing from Liverpool \u2013 can still return to the prolific form of his Anfield days as the striker still has \"potential, quality and desire\". Di Matteo, who has been joined on the coaching staff by his former No2 at West Bromwich Albion, the former Chelsea midfielder Eddie Newton, will oversee the side for the first time against Birmingham City on Tuesday evening in an awkward fifth-round FA Cup replay at St Andrew's. The squad were made aware of Abramovich's intense frustration and anger at a season of underachievement during an hour-long meeting at Cobham immediately after Villas-Boas' sacking on Sunday \u2013 the Portuguese was the owner's personal appointment \u2013 with the players accepting they must now attempt to salvage the campaign. \"I think we have to start again,\" said Juan Mata, a player bought by Villas-Boas from Valencia last summer and one of the team's more consistent performers. \"We are not in a good moment, we are not in a good run of results but we all want to change it. I think we are ready to change it. We have a very good squad and we have two months to achieve our objectives in the Premier League, in the FA Cup and Champions League.\"",

      "bodyText": "The BBC lacks ambition in its plans to boost commercial revenue, at a time when it is being forced to make substantial budget cuts, a committee of MPs say today. A report by the public accounts committee, which scrutinises public expenditure, criticises the corporation for saying that it would only bring in an extra \u00a340m a year from BBC Worldwide, its commercial arm. The BBC plans to raise commercial income from \u00a3280m to \u00a3320m a year by 2016-17. \"If the target remains unchanged, the [BBC] Trust should provide us with a clear explanation of why \u00a340m is the tipping point, beyond which further rises would distort the market or be over ambitious,\" the report states. The MPs also call on BBC executives to be open about how planned cuts will impact on services and how it will affect quality. \"Those who watch and listen to the BBC's services will want to know that the savings the BBC has made have not affected the quality of its output. The BBC cannot give them that assurance,\" said Richard Bacon, a Conservative member of the committee. \"As it moves from making efficiency savings to cutting services, the BBC needs to be open about how these cuts will impact on services and what it will do if quality suffers too much. \"The BBC must maximise its commercial income. But the BBC's plans for this are unambitious when placed in the context of the financial pressures on the broadcaster.\" He added: \"We expect a clear explanation of why a \u00a340m-a-year increase in commercial income is the limit of what can be achieved.\" BBC Worldwide reported record underlying profit up 10% year on year to \u00a3160m in the 12 months to the end of March 2011, on a 7.8% increase in revenue to \u00a31.16bn \u2013 also a record figure. Bestselling shows overseas included Doctor Who, Sherlock and Top Gear. The BBC has faced criticism in the past from rival media companies that it is abusing its position as a publicly funded broadcaster if it becomes too commercially aggressive. BBC Worldwide's acquisition of the travel guides firm Lonely Planet in 2007 proved particularly controversial. Bacon also said that it had taken the pressure of the October 2010 BBC funding deal with the government to force the corporation into setting a more testing annual savings target of 3%. The controversial and hastily negotiated deal froze the licence fee at its current level until 2016-17 and also requires the BBC to take on extra funding responsibilities, including the World Service. He said the BBC had earlier claimed that it could make no further efficiency savings beyond 2008. The committee said the BBC had managed the efficiency programme well and was currently forecasting that it would deliver \u00a3560m of annual savings by the end of 2012-13, comfortably exceeding its target. In October 2011 the BBC published Delivering Quality First, which sets out its proposals to make \u00a3700m of annual savings by 2016-17 to cope with the 2010 licence fee settlement. These proposals involve cutting an estimated 2,000 jobs, almost 10% of the BBC's UK workforce. A BBC spokesperson said that the report would be welcomed: \"The NAO report acknowledges that the BBC is achieving a good balance between delivering value for money through the financial savings targets that the BBC Trust has set whilst at the same time ensuring that the quality of the output remains high. \"All indications are that we are delivering on both fronts but we will continue to monitor these targets closely.\"",

      "bodyText": "Nissan will build its new compact car at its factory in Sunderland, creating 2,000 jobs and providing a major boost to one of the regions hardest hit by recession and spending cuts, the company says. The business secretary, Vince Cable, will confirm at the Geneva Motor Show that the Nissan expansion \u2013 which will create 400 jobs at the factory and 1,600 more in the supply chain \u2013 was underwritten by \u00a39m from the government's regional growth fund. He will say: \"The decision [from Nissan] is another clear vote of confidence in Britain's manufacturing industry, and vindicates the government's decision to put support for manufacturing at the core of its economic strategy.\" The move comes as 2,800 workers at the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port, in the Wirral, await the outcome of a review of General Motors' European operations that could lead to the closure of the factory. Cable flew to New York last week to persuade executives at GM, which owns Vauxhall, to keep open the plant, which is one of the region's biggest employers. But the business secretary told the BBC on Monday he had concerns about the factory's future. \"We have set out a very positive case to them for remaining and indeed expanding their operations in the UK,\" he said. \"I'm positive, but it is their decision and they haven't yet made it.\" GM is considering closing at least two factories in Europe, with Ellesmere Port and Bochum, in Germany, understood to be facing the most serious threat. GM is expected to make a decision on Ellesmere Port at the end of the month. However, Cable hailed improved relations between trade unions and management, as well as co-operation between universities and companies, for enabling the \"transformation\" of an industry that was in the doldrums in the early 1980s. Nissan's Sunderland venture, founded in 1986, is widely viewed as a turning point for the UK industry. \"A generation ago, the [UK] automotive sector appeared to be in irreversible decline, beset by strikes and poor management, but today it is a sector transformed,\" he said. The unnamed compact car will be unveiled in Geneva on Tuesday. Nissan's head of European manufacturing, Trevor Mann, said the move would maintain Sunderland's position as the UK's largest car factory. \"I'm delighted that Sunderland has secured what will be another very important model for Nissan in Europe,\" he said. \"It is a testament to the workforce, the ongoing support from the UK government, and all of our regional partners and suppliers.\" Tommy Brennan, regional official of the GMB union, said: \"This is really good news for the north-east and all the suppliers to Nissan where GMB members work. It is a ray of sunshine.\" The number of people employed at the factory, which has benefited from rising demand for cars from emerging economies such as Russia and China, will rise to a new record of more than 6,000. Last year, the plant hit a production record when 480,000 vehicles rolled out of the facility, where the Qashqai, Juke and Note brands are made. The Nissan announcement will be welcome news in the north-east, which has been hit hard in the past three years by job losses not just in traditional industries such as steelmaking, but also in the service and public sectors. Other British car manufacturers are also hiring more workers. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is creating a further 1,750 jobs, and Toyota has announced plans for 1,500 new jobs at its plant in Burnaston, Derby. JLR, Britain's biggest car industry employer, has said that while it is considering plans to begin manufacturing in China, it will also be creating more jobs in the UK as it responds to increasing demand. Itand will increase production at its plant at Halewood, on Merseyside, where the Range Rover Evoque is made. JLR is said to be close to a \u00a31.75bn partnership with the Chinese carmaker Chery. Ralf Speth, JLR's chief executive, who is in Geneva to promote a new soft-top model of the Evoque and a new Jaguar, tried to allay fears that expansion in Asia would cost British jobs. He said: \"We are expanding like never before, but this is not instead of building in the UK: it is in addition to.\" Speaking in Geneva, the head of Toyota's European operations, Didier Leroy, played down the impact of a manufacturing glut on the Japanese carmaker. The threat to Ellesmere Port is symptomatic of a capacity problem hitting most manufacturers on the continent, but Leroy said Toyota had no plans to cut back at any of its nine plants, including Burnaston and Deeside, where a total of 3,000 people are employed. \"We don't have any need to make any reform of capacity in Europe. We have absolutely no overcapacity at the European level,\" said Leroy, adding that Toyota had already started to overhaul its European operations two years ago. However, Leroy warned that a slump will hit the industry this year, with pan-European sales expected to fall 5%. \"In 2012 we know that the market is very difficult. At the start of the year the western part of Europe is even worse than was planned a few months ago,\" said Leroy. Analysts say the decline in sales is leaving mass-volume car makers with too much capacity, amid industry estimates that the major plants are only 80% utilised. Nonetheless, Toyota expects to sell 835,000 cars in Europe this year, including Russia and Turkey, up from 822,000 in 2011.",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Nissan will build its new compact car at its factory in Sunderland, creating 2,000 jobs and providing a major boost to one of the regions hardest hit by recession and spending cuts, the company says.</p> <p>The business secretary, Vince Cable, will confirm at the Geneva Motor Show that the Nissan expansion \u2013 which will create 400 jobs at the factory and 1,600 more in the supply chain \u2013 was underwritten by \u00a39m from the government's regional growth fund.</p> <p>He will say: \"The decision [from Nissan] is another clear vote of confidence in Britain's manufacturing industry, and vindicates the government's decision to put support for manufacturing at the core of its economic strategy.\"</p> <p>The move comes as 2,800 workers at the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port, in the Wirral, await the outcome of a review of General Motors' European operations that could lead to the closure of the factory.</p> <p>Cable flew to New York last week to persuade executives at GM, which owns Vauxhall, to keep open the plant, which is one of the region's biggest employers. But the business secretary told the BBC on Monday he had concerns about the factory's future. \"We have set out a very positive case to them for remaining and indeed expanding their operations in the UK,\" he said. \"I'm positive, but it is their decision and they haven't yet made it.\"</p> <p>GM is considering closing at least two factories in Europe, with Ellesmere Port and Bochum, in Germany, understood to be facing the most serious threat. GM is expected to make a decision on Ellesmere Port at the end of the month.</p> <p>However, Cable hailed improved relations between trade unions and management, as well as co-operation between universities and companies, for enabling the \"transformation\" of an industry that was in the doldrums in the early 1980s. Nissan's Sunderland venture, founded in 1986, is widely viewed as a turning point for the UK industry.</p> <p>\"A generation ago, the [UK] automotive sector appeared to be in irreversible decline, beset by strikes and poor management, but today it is a sector transformed,\" he said. The unnamed compact car will be unveiled in Geneva on Tuesday.</p> <p>Nissan's head of European manufacturing, Trevor Mann, said the move would maintain Sunderland's position as the UK's largest car factory. \"I'm delighted that Sunderland has secured what will be another very important model for Nissan in Europe,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It is a testament to the workforce, the ongoing support from the UK government, and all of our regional partners and suppliers.\"</p> <p>Tommy Brennan, regional official of the GMB union, said: \"This is really good news for the north-east and all the suppliers to Nissan where GMB members work. It is a ray of sunshine.\"</p> <p>The number of people employed at the factory, which has benefited from rising demand for cars from emerging economies such as Russia and China, will rise to a new record of more than 6,000.</p> <p>Last year, the plant hit a production record when 480,000 vehicles rolled out of the facility, where the Qashqai, Juke and Note brands are made.</p> <p>The Nissan announcement will be welcome news in the north-east, which has been hit hard in the past three years by job losses not just in traditional industries such as steelmaking, but also in the service and public sectors.</p> <p>Other British car manufacturers are also hiring more workers.

      "bodyText": "A brief surge in consumer confidence over the Christmas period appeared to evaporate in February after a fall in retail sales and a slowdown in the all-important services sector. The British Retail Consortium reported that retail sales values were down 0.3% on a like-for-like basis from the same month last year, when sales had already fallen 0.4% on February 2010. Economic activity in the services sector, which covers banking to hairdressing, remained positive during February, but could only register 53.8 compared to 56, which had been a 10-month peak, in January. The combination of weak high street sales and a slowing services sector will trouble the chancellor George Osborne as it comes after manufacturers reported lower sales in February. Until last week, economic indicators revealed a more positive mood and many economists predicted the UK would narrowly escape a double-dip recession. The latest surveys of business health appear to show that trend has reversed. Osborne is expected to tell parliament later this month that the choppy and unpredictable nature of the recovery continues to restrict his room for manoeuvre. He is expected to reject calls for his budget on 21 March to provide a spending boost in response to the weakening economic data. Stephen Robertson, the BRC's director general, said: \"The reality of weak sales shows that a convincing revival remains illusory. \"Falling inflation has eased the squeeze on household finances and halted the slide in consumer confidence but that's at risk from fuel price rises and budget uncertainty. Unemployment is expected to rise further causing increased nervousness about job security, which is keeping confidence fragile. Any sense of improving optimism is not yet translating into more spending.\" The BRC said food sales picked up, helped by customers who felt the need to stock up in the very cold weather, but non-food sales weakened further, despite a bonanza of promotions and discounts in the post-Christmas sales. A squeeze on household incomes affected clothing, footwear and homewares more than other areas, with larger purchases especially badly hit. The Markit/Cips purchasing managers' index for services, which accounts for around 75% of economic activity, defied expectations that it would slow only slightly by dropping to 53.8 from 56, though it remained well above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. On a positive note, confidence about the year ahead climbed to the highest level in 12 months, with more than half of services firms voicing optimism about their prospects against one in 10 who were downbeat. Employment also edged higher. The performance of the UK services sector contrasts with that of the eurozone. Separate data, released on Monday, showed the eurozone services sector contracted last month, in a blow to hopes that the region will avoid slipping back into recession. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said the UK PMI data was \"disappointing, but not the end of the world\". \"Overall, the PMIs are consistent with a moderate pace of expansion in overall GDP \u2013 broadly in line with what the Bank of England has assumed,\" he added. Other PMI releases last week showed that UK manufacturing also slowed last month while construction output grew at the fastest pace in nearly a year. Taken together, the surveys suggest the economy will return to modest growth in the first quarter and escape a double-dip recession assuming there is no further loss of momentum in March, said Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit. The British economy shrank by 0.2% in the final three months of last year.",

      "bodyText": "People who mask their faces to conceal their identity or carry anything that could be used as a weapon during protests should be pursued more vigorously by the law in the event of disorder, according to fresh guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service. Telephone and computer records should also be checked to see if there is evidence of planning violent or illegal disturbances, the advice drawn up by the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Keir Starmer QC, states. Prosecutors are also being urged to work more closely with the police to examine social network sites. The 13 page document, which will be circulated to CPS prosecutors on Tuesday, applies to public disorder cases such as demonstrations that turn violent or result in criminal damage rather than the more serious outbreaks of rioting experienced last summer. The DPP's guidance is intended to strike a balance between the rights of peaceful protest and free speech, and preventing the breakdown of public order. Prosecutors are encouraged to draw a distinction between those who organise or anticipate criminal offences and others who may have been caught up in illegal actions. It may not necessarily be in the pubic interest to bring charges against the latter group, the guidance says. \"It is \u2026 essential that the evidence in public protest-related cases is carefully scrutinised, especially where those involved have covered or partially covered their faces and/or where arrests take place some time after the incident in question. \"Prosecutors should have particular regard to whether there is evidence that a person had come to the protest equipped with clothes or mask to prevent identification, items that could be considered body protection, or an item that can be used as a weapon, as it may indicate the person came in anticipation of disorder at the protest or there was an element of planning before the commission of the offence.\" Other signs of planning may be stored online or in data records, the CPS advice says. \"Prosecutors should consider whether there is evidence of telephone or computer records or social network activity that show that the suspect was closely involved in the commission of the offence. \"There may also be CCTV coverage or video footage from the police or videos made by protesters uploaded onto the internet that may provide evidence of a person's participation in an incident.\" The advice has been issued following a series of appeal cases over what constitutes freedom of expression, under the European convention on human rights, in the context of public demonstrations. Starmer told the Guardian: \"The purpose of the guidance is to distinguish between those who want to be violent and disruptive and those who go with an essentially peaceful purpose but get caught up in things. \"There's a potential for a number of protests over the coming years that may be quite large \u2026 If someone has brought along a weapon or means of concealing their identity that's likely to be evidence that they were anticipating trouble or disorder.\" Postings on social networks can equally be indications of arranging violent confrontations, the DPP explained. The sit-ins in Fortnum &amp; Mason during anti-City protests, he suggested, were an example of large number of demonstrators being caught up unintentionally in trouble. Some of the charges have since been dropped. The guidance is aimed at striking the right balance between preserving free speech and preventing the break down of law and order, Starmer added. \"It seeks to balance the public's rightful expectation that offenders should face justice, with our legally enshrined, and age-old tradition, of peaceful protest. \"So criminals bent on disruption and disorder are warned they will not get an easy ride. My intention is that this guidance should ensure these difficult cases are dealt with proportionately and consistently.\"",

      "bodyText": "Aviation industry lobbyists have stepped up attempts to force the vexed question of a third runway at Heathrow back on to the agenda of an unwilling government, with unions and directors warning that inaction will cost thousands of jobs. BAA-sponsored research by Oxford Economics claims Britain could lose out on more than 140,000 jobs if there is no clear support for a UK hub airport. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said that decisive action was needed to maintain the airport's status. \"Our economy desperately needs an airport infrastructure which is better than the patchwork provision we currently have around the capital,\" he said. \"Our politicians must think big and act in the national interest. We need an aviation strategy that acknowledges Heathrow as a hub, and we need it now.\" The Institute of Directors also endorsed the research, which found that capacity constraints will cost the UK \u00a34.5bn in GDP from foreign investment and \u00a31.6bn in lost trade with emerging markets by 2021. Mick Rix, of the GMB union, said it was \"plain daft\" to exclude the option of expanding Heathrow. \"As this new research shows, there's an immediate need to safeguard the jobs and GDP that Heathrow provides.\" The latest salvo in BAA's campaign for a third runway at Heathrow comes before this month's expected publication of the aviation white paper, which will discuss long-term strategy and options for airport capacity growth \u2013 possibly including a new hub in the Thames estuary. More than 70 business leaders signed an open letter to chancellor George Osborne and transport secretary Justine Greening, published at the weekend in the Sunday Telegraph, demanding an aviation strategy for growth that \"considers all options\" \u2013 a thinly veiled demand to back Heathrow, for which a third runway was explicitly ruled out again in the autumn statement BAA on Monday reiterated its threat to seek a judicial review if Heathrow is pre-emptively removed from consideration before any consultations on expanding airport capacity. It said: \"None of the options for providing new hub capacity is easy, but all options should be on the table. It is important that major decisions by government follow due process and the option to seek a judicial review if they do not is always available. We expect the government to carefully consider the pros and cons of all options and consult properly before taking any policy decisions.\" Environmentalists have been monitoring BAA's latest lobbying offensive, but the presence of Greening at the Department for Transport, who campaigned against a third runway, rules out imminent change for Heathrow. Moves toward expansion would make her position untenable. At the official opening of London Southend airport on Monday, Greening insisted British airports were well placed to provide flights to the far east markets that BAA fears losing. \"Any decision will need careful consideration,\" she said. \"If you were starting from scratch today, you would not put Heathrow where it is, and we need to look at how we can keep a competitive edge going forward.\" John Stewart, chair of Hacan, which represents residents under the Heathrow flight path, said: \"The argument has been settled. BAA will not accept that the current government rejected both the environmental and economic case for Heathrow expansion. It's a sign of its desperation that it has wheeled out Oxford Economics to do the report. These were the consultants who provided the economic basis for the now discredited 2003 air transport white paper.\" Seema Malhotra, the recently elected MP for Feltham and Heston, a constituency under the Heathrow flight path, has tabled an amendment to the civil aviation bill to compensate residents for noise pollution. \u2022 Justine Greening echoed the complaints of campaigners through the years that Heathrow was in the wrong place on Monday. Asked to comment on the debate around the need for a new hub, including controversial plans for a new airport in the Thames Estuary, she insisted existing UK airports were well placed in providing flights to the far east. But Greening added: \"Any decision will need careful consideration. If you were starting from scratch today, you would not put Heathrow where it is, and we need to look at how we can keep a competitive edge going forward.\" She was speaking at the opening of London Southend airport's new passenger terminal, where she stressed the importance of looking beyond the biggest airports serving London. \"The current debate on the future of aviation in our country as a whole has focused on hubs such as Heathrow and Gatwick. \"Our regional airports have an absolutely vital part to play in making sure the aviation sector remains competitive and continues to serve businesses and the community.\"",

      "bodyText": "Fifty years after its groundbreaking report in which doctors first tried to talk directly to the public about the catastrophic dangers of smoking, the Royal College of Physicians warns today that the death toll from cigarettes will not fall unless the government takes decisive action. On the anniversary of its celebrated 1962 report on smoking and health that started to turn the tide, the RCP says more than six million people have lost their lives to tobacco and more than a fifth of the population still uses cigarettes. Although the price of a packet of cigarettes has steadily increased, it is now 50% more affordable than in 1965, said Professor John Britton, chair of its tobacco advisory group. Prices are further cut through discounting and illicit supply. \"The real failure is political leadership,\" he said. \"Some of our governments in the past have been extremely close to the tobacco industry. Margaret Thatcher left office and took up a three-year role with Philip Morris, and Kenneth Clarke, who had been a health secretary, became a director of British American Tobacco.\" Tony Blair's government later delayed enforcing a ban on tobacco sponsorship in Formula One after a controversial \u00a31m donation to the Labour party by Bernie Ecclestone. On Tuesday Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, will face calls for price rises, plain packaging, prime-time TV campaigns and curbs on smoking in films at a one-day conference at the college, called to examine progress over the 50 years. The government is to announce onTuesday a campaign highlighting the damaging effects of secondhand smoke The college says that the 20% of people now smoking stand to lose 100m years of life between them. Even though smoking rates have fallen substantially and smoking is now something of a pariah sport since it was banned in bars and restaurants, around 10 million people in the UK still have the habit. Half of those will die because of it. Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, agrees that plain packaging should be introduced \u2013 a measure the industry is fighting hard against. \"We need to do more to discourage children and young people starting smoking in the first place,\" he said. \"The evidence shows young people are influenced, and sometimes misled, by glitzy cigarette packaging, so stripping packs of their attractive colours and logos by introducing plain, standardised packaging will help lessen the lure of smoking to a new generation.\" Although the ban on smoking in enclosed public places, which took effect in 2007, has changed perceptions, Knapton said tobacco \"remains the UK's biggest cause of avoidable early death, so it's right that the focus is now shifting to the effect of smoking in the home and confined spaces such as cars, especially where children are present\". Britton also wants action against smoking in films and on TV. \"There is a terrific amount of smoking imagery in films passed suitable for 12-year-olds,\" he said. \"In Gavin &amp; Stacey's Christmas special they were sharing a cigarette from a branded pack of Marlboro outside the house.\" The 1962 RCP report was a significant milestone in the relationship between doctor and patient, marking the moment when physicians began to promote public health more seriously. Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill provided the definitive study in the 1950s that demonstrated the lethal nature of tobacco by following a cohort of smoking and non-smoking doctors. But the study had an ambivalent and even hostile response in some quarters of the government, media and society. With social barriers coming down in the 1960s, doctors at the RCP felt it was time to speak out to the public they would otherwise encounter in their consulting rooms with lung disease. The public responded, and the ministry of health was inundated with anti-smoking ideas in the following years. In an article on the influence of the 1962 report in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Virginia Berridge, professor of history at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, cited a letter \u2013 now in the national archives \u2013 to the ministry of health from a D Kelly the following year. \"A rhyming poster might work \u2026 'THE MODERN BLOKE\u2014DOESN'T SMOKE',\" he wrote. \"The ladies are less of a problem\u2013but a growing one. What about 'CONTEMPORARY HAGS ABHOR FAGS' with a similar illustration of modern witches refusing temptation.\" In the foreword to a booklet launched today, the RCP president, Sir Richard Thompson, looks back to a world 50 years ago \"suffocated by the swirling clouds of tobacco smoke, in pubs, cinemas, trains, buses on the streets and even in hospitals and schools. Around 70% of men and 40% of women smoked. Smoking was omnipresent, accepted, established\". In 2012, we live in a world in which smoking is no longer the norm, he said. \"I hope that in another 50 years smoking, like slavery, will have passed into history.\"",
