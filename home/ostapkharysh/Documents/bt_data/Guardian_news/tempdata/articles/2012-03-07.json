      "bodyText": "The UN's humanitarian chief has described the Baba Amr district of Homs, Syria, as devastated and almost devoid of inhabitants. Amanda Pitt, a spokeswoman for Lady Amos's office, said: \"She [Amos] said that security was obviously an issue and they heard gunfire while they were there. The parts of Baba Amr that they saw, she said they were pretty devastated.\" The UN chief entered the shattered suburb alongside aid workers in what activists called a distraction from the regime's attacks on civilians. A Syrian Red Crescent team made a 45-minute visit to Baba Amr on Wednesday, six days after the Syrian government first promised to allow humanitarian relief to be delivered to the area. Volunteers said most residents appeared to have left. Those who survived the brutal four-week onslaught by president Bashar al-Assad's army were now in suburbs of Homs and outlying areas, including the village of Abel, 10km south of the city, where aid is being distributed. \"It was like a closed-down city and there were very few people around,\" Pitt said, adding that it \"looked like it was devastated from the fighting and shelling.\" \"They saw a few people looking for their belongings,\" she said. Speaking to the Guardian, Abo Emad, an activist in Homs, described the Red Crescent's visit as a distraction. He said: \"The main humanitarian need in Homs is for the Assad militias to leave, because they are the people who are killing us. That's more important than the lack of food and water and medical supplies. \"They [the authorities] have been trying to clean the Insha'at and Baba Amr area so that they can say 'armed gangs' did all the damage. It's a kind of setup.\" Emad said the regime was bringing in supporters from pro-regime neighbourhoods to Baba Amr in a stage-managed ploy to demonstrate support for the government. Regime forces recaptured Baba Amr last Thursday but residents say Damascus deliberately delayed allowing the UN and the Red Crescent to make a visit in order to cover up evidence of atrocities and carry out \"mopping up\" operations by pro-government soldiers and militias. Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moualem met Amos on Wednesday and, Pitt said, confirmed she would be able to travel anywhere she wished in Syria. Amos is now back in Damascus and is scheduled to complete her visit on Friday. Her goal is to secure access for humanitarian organisations, which have been barred from the heaviest conflict zones. The UN estimates that more than 7,500 civilians have died in the government's crackdown on anti-Assad demonstrators around the country. The violence on the ground in Syria now appears to have shifted from Homs to other areas. The Syrian military on Wednesday attacked the pro-rebel town of Idlib near the Turkish border, according to witnesses, shelling several northern villages. In the southern province of Dera'a, thousands of people attended the funeral of two men killed this week by Syrian army mortars. Kofi Annan, the new UN-Arab League special envoy to Syria, is likely to visit Damascus on Saturday. It is not clear if Assad will meet him and the prospect of a diplomatic breakthrough appears slim. Despite predictions of Assad's imminent downfall, his regime appears to be more resilient under pressure than some had expected. Western diplomats concede he may, given time, succeed in crushing the uprising, which began a year ago next week. The British ambassador to Syria, Simon Collis, who left Damascus on security grounds just over a week ago, said it was clear Assad's regime was \"doomed\" but a quick resolution was unlikely. Writing on the UN website, he said: \"People know that, that the regime is doomed. \"Many business people and others have told me that they understand this, they don't want to be part of it. They don't see a future for themselves or their families, but they're fearful of acting right now because the regime is still able to get them or their family.\" Assad has cast rebel fighters from the Free Syrian Army as al-Qaida extremists. But most observers believe Syria's violent conflict isn't sectarian in character, even though the areas that have led the rebellion are predominantly Sunni Muslim. Assad, from Syria's ruling Alawite minority, has cast himself as the only person capable of guaranteeing the rights of non-Sunni groups. On Tuesday, Assad said he would continue to confront \"foreign-backed terrorism\", state media reported. Britain and the US have repeatedly ruled out arming Syria's rebels. Instead, they are trying to increase political support to the country's nascent opposition. In Washington, US defence secretary Leon Panetta rejected fresh demands for US military involvement in Syria to end Assad's crackdown. \"What doesn't make sense is to take unilateral action right now,\" Panetta told the Senate armed services committee about advising Obama to dispatch US forces. The panel's top Republican, Senator John McCain, said the estimated 7,500 dead meant that the US administration should emulate the leadership demonstrated by Obama in Libya last year. \"In past situations, America has led. We're not leading, Mr Secretary,\" McCain told Panetta. Russia and China, powerful Syrian allies which have blocked a UN security council resolution, have made clear they were still standing by the regime in Damascus.",

The president lost out to the insurance industry, and his reforms ended up regulating private players as opposed to creating a state-run competitor to challenge them into raising their game. There are parallels with a rumbling under-the-radar row about British pensions. Adair Turner's pensions commission accomplished something routinely proposed but rarely accomplished \u2013 a true cross-party consensus. The ingredients were later retirement, higher state benefits, and \u2013 just as important \u2013 an overhaul of personal saving to make it pay for everyone to invest for old age. The eye-catching change here was to set laziness to work, by enrolling every worker who does not actively opt out into an account that their employer is also forced to chip into. With the numbers in workplace pensions at a 50-year low, this change \u2013 which will soon be phased-in \u2013 is overdue. But Lord Turner did not want to strong-arm cash-strapped people towards pension pots rendered leaky by high charges. To stretch small savings into decent pensions, he thus proposed a new not-for-profit outfit to collect and manage the money at a fraction of traditional costs. Happily, and unlike in Obamacare, the \"public option\" has come to being, and the body known by the acronym Nest held its inaugural research forum yesterday. Arms-length from Whitehall, and pitted against all-comers in an avowedly competitive private market, this is a world away from an old-style nationalised industry. Insurance firms are already offering somewhat lower charges to target savers, and anyone burnt by past mis-selling is surely grateful for the new choice. So what, you might ask, is not to like? Quite a bit, for a pension giant. A cut-price, no-nonsense default provider is also inconvenient for any advisers who reap exorbitant fees to navigate hapless punters through the grim choice between overpriced plans. This lobby cowed first Labour and now the coalition to tie up Nest in restrictions which Adam Smith might have called a conspiracy against the public. For a start, Nest is barred from accepting any contribution of over \u00a34,400 a year, a stricture designed to keep it out of the action in the higher end of market, which is the industry's chief interest. But for older workers who start saving late this may not be enough, and younger employees will also have to enlist in a second scheme if they go on to get a big pay rise. The dead hand of this regulation will force firms to run separate schemes for management. And while Nest eggs will often be portable to new jobs in future, there is a separate bar on transferring pre-existing plans into them. Those whose past jobs have chopped and changed will be condemned to keep up the admin on several schemes, a headache which makes planning for retirement harder. This cuts against the core principle of the wider reform, which is making saving so brain-numbingly simple that it is easier to do it than not. That approach has to be right, seeing as the evidence summed up at yesterday's conference by the American scholar Michael Sherraden demonstrated that \"by and large human beings are not very good at this financial stuff\". Aside, of course, from the minority that has a talent for cleaning up. The pensions minister, Steve Webb, who is emerging as one of the Lib Dems' ablest performers, implicitly conceded the case for change when he said that the aim must be for every individual to build up all their savings into a single \"big fat pot\". Quite right, but what is the government going to do? There are supposed concerns about European state aid rules but the industry is likely hyping these up. One cannot imagine the French being held back by such fears \u2013 the government should put savers first, and wait to see how the European court responds. With the crisis and the payments protection insurance scandals combining to leave the financial services sector mistrusted as never before, there has never been a more opportune moment for calling the industry's bluff.",

      "bodyText": "In 1984, when Calvin Burdine was awaiting sentencing for allegedly stabbing his gay lover to death, the prosecuting attorney encouraged the jury in his closing remarks to award Burdine the death penalty, rather than life in prison, on the grounds that sending a gay man to prison was akin to sending a kid to a candy store. After 17 minutes of deliberation, the jury obliged and sentenced Burdine to die. His death sentence was later overturned (mostly because Burdine's public defender had slept through much of his trial), but the homophobic thinking \u2013 that prison is some kind of paradise for gay men \u2013 lingers on. The reality of life in prison for homosexuals and transgender individuals does not appear to reflect this myth. One young man named Rodney, imprisoned for fraud and check-forging, sent me a detailed account of his life so far in prison. He described a litany of brutal rapes, assaults, beatings and, eventually, the total abandonment of his male identity as his only means of survival in the hyper-masculine and often homophobic prison environment. His account suggests that far from being a paradise, prison for gay men can be a living hell. Within days of his first entering prison, the 23-year-old Rodney claimed he was the victim of three separate sexual assaults, involving five different inmates. The prison he was first sent to did actually have a separate tier for gay inmates, but according to Rodney, because he did not \"appear overly effeminate\" during his classification, he was placed with the general population; and because it was supposedly rare to have a gay person slip through the cracks of the system, his fellow inmates took full advantage. \"My first week or so in general population was hell on earth. Physical, mental and emotional torture. After being raped, I performed acts by request. It was understood and expected. I had no means to protect myself, being only 23 and scared for my life. \"I dared not report anything because I was clearly warned that my life would be in jeopardy should I do so. I quickly learned that a snitch is a worse label than a fag. \"Against popular opinion, jail is not heaven for a homosexual. Nothing is heaven about being intimidated into performing sexual acts. It is also rape, just like the three forcible rapes were. \"True enough, I am attracted to men and always have been, but in life [outside], it's my choice whom I share a bed with; it's intimate and personal. Having my mouth and anus aggressively penetrated by several strangers is anything but.\" He went on to report how one of his rapists took a fancy to him and \"purchased\" him from the tier rep for $20. Even though he was thereby essentially enslaved by his new \"prison husband\", he was grateful \u2013 because his days of \"being the communal bitch were over\". He said he tried to do whatever his prison husband wanted or needed, including cleaning his cell, washing his clothes, preparing his food, and whatever else his \"husband\" wanted or needed, including, of course, being available for sex \u2013 because \"he did what I wanted and needed \u2013 kept other inmates off me.\" As time wore on and \"husbands\" came and went, Rodney perfected the art of being a \"prison ho\", as his only means of surviving intact. This involved establishing a female name and identity, learning how to speak when spoken to, \"respect his man\" and emasculating himself to the point where he could not stand while urinating. There is nothing about the experience that could be considered enjoyable. \"I've heard before that 'jail is a faggot's dream.' I assure you that clich\u00e9 is not the case. Gay men who do not attempt to hide their sexuality are forced into passive and submissive roles. To live with some standard of equality, we have to trade in our manhood. We are completely emasculated. It's a form of technical castration. The role of woman is forced upon us and any rebuttal is considered a sign of disrespect. My way of thinking about myself and my sexuality has been permanently altered.\" It's difficult to assess how typical Rodney's prison experience is, but numerous studies conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, based on anonymous inmate surveys, have shown that gay and transgender inmates are among the most targeted groups for sexual victimization. Until fairly recently, little has been done to help them. Just Detention International (JDI), an organization whose aim is to eradicate prison rape (pdf), is trying to change that. JDI has been working with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to establish \"sensitive needs yards\" (pdf), where gay, transgender and other vulnerable inmates can serve out their time in safety. Several prisons operated by the CDCR have now established sensitive needs yard with some success, and the JDI is hoping that other states will adopt this model. In the meantime, prisoners like Rodney have been forced to make their peace with their \"prison ho\" fate. \"I've grown to realize that I am a man and being a prison ho is an act.\" It is not, however, an act that Rodney or any other inmate should be forced to perform.",

      "body": "<p>In 1984, when <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/slated-release-gay-texas-inmate-further-reveals-death-penaltys-injustice-merits\">Calvin Burdine was awaiting sentencing</a> for allegedly stabbing his gay lover to death, the prosecuting attorney encouraged the jury in his closing remarks to award Burdine the death penalty, rather than life in prison, on the grounds that sending a gay man to prison was akin to sending a kid to a candy store. After 17 minutes of deliberation, <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/content/printVersion/163718/\">the jury obliged and sentenced Burdine to die</a>. His death sentence was later overturned (mostly because Burdine's public defender had slept through much of his trial), but the homophobic thinking \u2013 that prison is some kind of paradise for gay men \u2013 lingers on.</p> <p>The reality of life in prison for homosexuals and transgender individuals does not appear to reflect this myth. One young man named Rodney, imprisoned for fraud and check-forging, sent me a detailed account of his life so far in prison. He described a litany of brutal rapes, assaults, beatings and, eventually, the total abandonment of his male identity as his only means of survival in the hyper-masculine and often homophobic prison environment. His account suggests that far from being a paradise, prison for gay men can be a living hell.</p> <p>Within days of his first entering prison, the 23-year-old Rodney claimed he was the victim of three separate sexual assaults, involving five different inmates. The prison he was first sent to did actually have a separate tier for gay inmates, but according to Rodney, because he did not \"appear overly effeminate\" during his classification, he was placed with the general population; and because it was supposedly rare to have a gay person slip through the cracks of the system, his fellow inmates took full advantage.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My first week or so in general population was hell on earth. Physical, mental and emotional torture. After being raped, I performed acts by request. It was understood and expected. I had no means to protect myself, being only 23 and scared for my life.</p> <p>\"I dared not report anything because I was clearly warned that my life would be in jeopardy should I do so. I quickly learned that a snitch is a worse label than a fag.</p> <p>\"Against popular opinion, jail is not heaven for a homosexual. Nothing is heaven about being intimidated into performing sexual acts. It is also rape, just like the three forcible rapes were.</p> <p>\"True enough, I am attracted to men and always have been, but in life [outside], it's my choice whom I share a bed with; it's intimate and personal. Having my mouth and anus aggressively penetrated by several strangers is anything but.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He went on to report how one of his rapists took a fancy to him and \"purchased\" him from the tier rep for $20. Even though he was thereby essentially enslaved by his new \"prison husband\", he was grateful \u2013 because his days of \"being the communal bitch were over\". He said he tried to do whatever his prison husband wanted or needed, including cleaning his cell, washing his clothes, preparing his food, and whatever else his \"husband\" wanted or needed, including, of course, being available for sex \u2013 because \"he did what I wanted and needed \u2013 kept other inmates off me.\"</p> <p>As time wore on and \"husbands\" came and went, Rodney perfected the art of being a \"prison ho\", as his only means of surviving intact. This involved establishing a female name and identity, learning how to speak when spoken to, \"respect his man\" and emasculating himself to the point where he could not stand while urinating. There is nothing about the experience that could be considered enjoyable.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I've heard before that 'jail is a faggot's dream.' I assure you that clich\u00e9 is not the case.

      "bodyText": "Airlines and energy suppliers are on alert as the largest solar storm in five years heads toward Earth, threatening to disrupt flights and power lines. The eruption on the surface of the sun, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), has led to a \"massive amount of solar particles heading towards Earth\", which are due to hit the planet between 6am and 10am on Thursday morning, a Met Office spokesman said. But he added that the phenomenon was likely to go unnoticed by most. The forecaster has advised airlines that they may reroute planes from near the polar regions where the radiation caused by the storm is likely to be most intense, while energy suppliers have been warned that the National Grid could also be affected. Solar storms can also cause communication problems, such as radio blackouts, as well as affecting satellites, disrupting oil pipelines and making global positioning systems (GPS) less accurate. \"It should arrive some time tomorrow morning and last through tomorrow,\" the Met Office spokesman added. \"In terms of what that means from the public's point of view, there's an increased chance of aurora borealis or Northern Lights being seen if conditions are right and the skies are clear.\" But Gemma Plumb, a forecaster with Meteogroup, said most of the UK would be cloudy during the solar storm. She said: \"From midnight there will be widespread cloud so there is unlikely to be much visibility.\" Forecasters at the US government's Space Weather Prediction Center said the storm is growing in intensity as it speeds outward from the sun. The charged particles hit Earth at 4 million mph (6.4 million kph). Nasa solar physicist Alex Young said: \"It could give us a bit of a jolt.\" The solar storm is likely to last until Friday morning, although further eruptions may follow. In North America, auroras or Northern Lights could stretch as far south as the Great Lakes states or even lower, but a full moon will make them hard to see, said Joe Kunches, a scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Solar storms have three ways they can disrupt technology on Earth: with magnetic, radio and radiation emissions. This is an unusual situation when all three types of emissions are likely to be strong, Kunches said. In 1989, a strong solar storm knocked out the power grid in Quebec, Canada, leaving 6 million people without power. Harlan Spence, an astrophysicist at the University of New Hampshire who is principal investigator on the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) aboard Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, said the sun was on the ascendant phase of its 11-year cycle of solar activity, with the peak expected next year. \"It's a clear harbinger that the Sun is waking up,\" Spence told Reuters.",

      "bodyText": "Lukas Podolski is poised to join Arsenal from K\u00f6ln at the end of the season after the clubs reached an agreement in principle on a \u00a310.9m transfer. The Germany striker is expected to sign a four-year contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week, according to sources in Germany. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has been under pressure to bolster his attacking options because the cover behind Robin van Persie, the captain, has looked thin, with neither Marouane Chamakh or Park Ju-young having convinced. Van Persie, who is close to the final 12 months of his Arsenal deal and has placed new contract talks on hold until the summer, must also be persuaded about the club's ambition. Podolski's arrival would represent a coup and it reinforces Wenger's shift in transfer policy towards more established players. Still only 26, the Poland-born forward has played at the highest level since his late teens, when he broke into the Germany squad. He has enjoyed a positive season, with 16 Bundesliga goals so far, but he has grown disillusioned at K\u00f6ln's direction. They languish just above the relegation places, with 25 points from 24 games. Podolski, who was at Bayern Munich from 2006 to 2009 before rejoining his former club, has been quiet about his possible move to Arsenal but the K\u00f6ln manager, Stale Solbakken, admitted last month that he feared he was set to lose the forward to the London club. Lokomotiv Moscow and Anzhi Makhachkala were also understood to have been chasing Podolski, and could have offered bigger money, but he said recently his move would not be determined by the highest bidder. \"Money is not the most important thing for me,\" he told Sport-Bild. \"What is crucial is the development of my game.\" Per Mertesacker, a Germany team-mate who moved from Werder Bremen to Arsenal last summer, told German television on Wednesday that Podolski had been asking him about life at the Emirates. \"He has been very interested for the past few weeks,\" Mertesacker said. \"He has sent me a number of text messages, and I have told him this is a great place to work and Arsenal are an amazing club.\"",

The Germany striker is expected to sign a four-year contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week, according to sources in Germany.</p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has been under pressure to bolster his attacking options because the cover behind Robin van Persie, the captain, has looked thin, with neither Marouane Chamakh or Park Ju-young having convinced.</p> <p>Van Persie, who is close to the final 12 months of his Arsenal deal and has placed new contract talks on hold until the summer, must also be persuaded about the club's ambition.</p> <p>Podolski's arrival would represent a coup and it reinforces Wenger's shift in transfer policy towards more established players. Still only 26, the Poland-born forward has played at the highest level since his late teens, when he broke into the Germany squad. He has enjoyed a positive season, with 16 Bundesliga goals so far, but he has grown disillusioned at K\u00f6ln's direction. They languish just above the relegation places, with 25 points from 24&#xa0;games.</p> <p>Podolski, who was at Bayern Munich from 2006 to 2009 before rejoining his former club, has been quiet about his possible move to Arsenal but the K\u00f6ln manager, Stale Solbakken, admitted last month that he feared he was set to lose the forward to the London club.</p> <p>Lokomotiv Moscow and Anzhi Makhachkala were also understood to have been chasing Podolski, and could have offered bigger money, but he said recently his move would not be determined by the highest bidder. \"Money is not the most important thing for me,\" he told Sport-Bild. \"What is crucial is the development of my game.\"</p> <p>Per Mertesacker, a Germany team-mate who moved from Werder Bremen to Arsenal last summer, told German television on Wednesday that Podolski had been asking him about life at the Emirates. \"He has been very interested for the past few weeks,\" Mertesacker said. \"He has sent me a number of text messages, and I have told him this is a great place to work and Arsenal are an amazing club.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fernando Torres turned down the chance to take Chelsea's 70th minute penalty in their FA Cup replay win at Birmingham City, which might have allowed him to end his near five-month scoring drought. Chelsea were 2-0 up and coasting into the quarter-finals on Tuesday night when Torres was fouled by Guirane N'Daw inside the area. Juan Mata, the designated penalty taker, offered the kick to Torres, his friend and fellow Spaniard, only for the 27-year-old to decline. Although Daniel Sturridge subsequently tried to claim the ball, Mata stepped up to the spot and saw his shot saved by Colin Doyle. Torres rarely takes penalties but his refusal to accept this one offered the latest illustration of his crisis of confidence. The striker's link-up play was again good, on his 50th appearance for Chelsea since a \u00a350m move from Liverpool, but he continued to snatch at anything in front of goal. He dragged a first-half chance wide and his descent to figure of fun was reinforced during the interval, when a Birmingham fan missed his kick in the half-time competition. \"It was worse than Torres,\" he told the on-pitch interviewer, to much hilarity. The St Andrew's crowd chanted \"We want Torres\" upon the award of the penalty. The forward, who has five goals in all competitions for Chelsea, has not scored in 23 matches. \"I asked him if he wanted to take it because he provoked [won] the penalty,\" Mata said. \"He said: 'I'm not first on the list to shoot,' so that's what happened. It was because he forced the penalty and I gave him the chance. Robbie [Di Matteo, the interim manager] put a paper with who shoots penalties and that was it.\" Chelsea continue their search for a permanent managerial replacement for Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, who was sacked on Sunday, and the club's hierarchy noted the anti-Rafael Ben\u00edtez chants that came from the visiting enclosure at St Andrew's. The former Liverpool manager has advanced his candidacy and has suggested he could help to restore Torres to his former glories, having overseen him during their time together at Anfield. But Chelsea's directors are not thought to have him under consideration. Chelsea's players were told by the owner Roman Abramovich, in the wake of Villas-Boas's dismissal, that they have to raise their game and there was the sense at Birmingham that the message had gone through. \"He [Abramovich] said that we have an opportunity to change the run of defeats and against Birmingham we did so,\" Mata said. \"We have to prove ourselves every game. For me and the other players, we are playing in a top squad and a top club, and we must always do our best in every game. \"There is a lot of unity in the dressing room. No matter who the manager is, we are all focused on the same objective. We must do the best for the club ... we belong to the club and we will do everything for the club. Every one of the players will do it. We will try to win this FA Cup and also against Napoli [in the Champions League last-16 second-leg]. I think we can do it \u2013 it is possible for us to win 2-0 [to advance on aggregate].\"",

There are poor people suffering and rich people raking it in. And they're not wrong. For one of the shocks that confronted them had less to do with the loans companies themselves than with the salary being paid to Tony Hobman, boss of the government-funded Money Advice Service. Its role is to help the poor deal with debt. But with his earnings of \u00a3350,000 a year, including bonuses and perks, Hobman should be able to keep the wolf from the door \u2013 in the short term, at least. It makes me \"hugely incentivised\", he told the Commons business committee. It's an \"extravagance\", said MPs. But he should care. With that sort of money, who needs friends? \u2022 The public finances are a mess, but credit's due to George Osborne. He's not the sort to stand idly by and do nothing. And so breaking, perhaps, with long-established protocol, we can reveal what he plans to do to raise money with his budget. He's privatising the budget process itself. Since for ever and a day, the budget papers, containing press releases and data, have been available free of charge as soon as the chancellor sits down. Hacks queue up and take them away from the Treasury. This year the chancellor is charging \u00a345 per copy for anyone who wants to read the fine print. Should raise a few thousand quid, and it might deter a good many from scrutinising the details. Clever Gideon. What is that, if not a win-win? \u2022 And these are heady days for Ukip, following two high-profile defections from the Tories. And now the best news of all: the return of Paul Wiffen. Paul who? You know Paul Wiffen. The musician. The one who played with Stevie Wonder and Jean Michel Jarre and had this strange double life as London chairman of Ukip. Contributed a few thoughts to communitycare.co.uk late one night, at which point his political career went a bit pear-shaped. \"You leftwing scum are all the same,\" he posted. \"Wanting to hand our birthright to Romanian gypsies who beat their wives and children into begging and stealing money they can gamble with, Muslim nutters who want to kill us and put us all under medieval Sharia law, the same Africans who sold their Afro-Caribbean brothers into a slavery that Britain was the first to abolish (but you still want to apologise for!). Worry about where we are going to live and grow food, you wanker,\" he said. He was suspended for a bit (for which he blamed this diary). But now he's back as Ukip's London North East candidate for the London assembly. Shows anything is possible. Quite comforting, really. \u2022 Here's to the survivors. Here's to Mark Thompson, now the BBC's longest serving director general since Charles Curran, in the 1960s. And unusually for that cohort, he is leaving at a time of his own choosing \u2013 after the anticipated glory of the London Olympics. But he has learned so much, and there is so much to pass on, so next Thursday Thompson pitches up at Oxford Brookes University to deliver a lecture. His topic: \"Disaster management and organisation continuity planning at the BBC: How to respond to disaster.\" Will the warm-up man be Jonathan Ross? \u2022 To the National Liberal Club, where some fear they are operating a secret colour bar. The spare tie tray at the club \u2013 ties are obligatory \u2013 may boast a nice selection of orangey gold, purple and pink ties, but there's no red or blue; nothing that might reference Labour or the Tories. \"We're not allowed those,\" confides an official sporting a gold tie. \"Only good Liberal ones.\" Perhaps a blueish cravat for Nick Clegg. \u2022 Finally, a football manager is sacked. Times readers demand the details. \"When are we going to get some in-depth analysis of the situation at Chelsea,\" asks Steve Dobell from London. \"Only five pages yesterday and no leading article since Monday; there is growing concern that you're not taking it seriously.\" Behold, the Wapping spring.

Obama could not find anything more cutting to say about Romney than the barbs Gingrich has already concocted. He has taken to referring to Romney as \"Wall Street\". This is more than the cut and thrust of politics. For a Republican party built on big business, it is fratricide. Torn between a candidate they don't like that might beat Obama, and candidates they are attracted to but can't, the GOP primary has ended up with a diminished crew of second-raters.

      "bodyText": "Rangers have been warned they are sliding towards liquidation after the bleakest prognoses of their future arrived both from the club's administrators and a current director on Wednesday. Having failed earlier in the day to agree a crucial and significant pay-cut deal for the squad, the administrators admitted the club may be unable to fulfil their remaining fixtures this season, triggering a desperate plea for new investment. Duff &amp; Phelps, the Rangers' administrators, threatened that if that was not forthcoming then they would need a significant batch of redundancies just to allow the team to complete this Scottish Premier League campaign. David Whitehouse, Rangers' joint administrator, said: \"We are announcing we are accelerating the sale of Rangers Football Club. The club is in a perilous financial situation and that should not be underestimated. Regrettably, we have been unable to agree cost-cutting measures with the playing staff on terms that will preserve value in the business. We understand the players' position as the scale of wage cuts required to achieve these savings without job losses were very substantial indeed. \"In view of this, we are faced with a situation of making redundancies within the playing staff on such a scale that would materially erode the value of the playing squad. We are striving to strike a balance where cost-cutting measures can be implemented but do not destroy the fabric of the playing squad to the extent that it will inhibit the prospect of a sale. \"However, no one should be in any doubt that in the absence of sufficient cost-cutting measures or receipt of substantial unplanned income, the club will not be able to fulfil its fixtures throughout the remainder of the season.\" Paul Clark, Whitehouse's fellow administrator, later confirmed Rangers have \"no realistic hope\" of being granted the licence which would allow them to compete in European football next season, in what represents a further financial blow. Clark added: \"There has, perhaps inevitably, been speculation about Rangers Football Club facing liquidation. As we have stated previously, we remain very confident that Rangers will not cease to exist and the team will continue to play at Ibrox. \"If a company voluntary arrangement is not possible for any particular reason, any buyer of the club and its assets would complete that purchase through a sale by the administrators allowing the football club to continue to operate, with the old company then being placed into liquidation prior to dissolution.\" Such a chain of events would have serious football and financial implications for Rangers, nonetheless. The desperate situation was spelled out by the administrators a matter of hours after Dave King, a Rangers director, labelled liquidation as a foregone conclusion. In a statement, King said: \"I do not believe that there is a reasonable prospect that the company can come out of administration. I believe that liquidation is inevitable.\" Paul Murray, who is leading a consortium which hopes to take over Rangers, is understood to have met with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs on Tuesday to establish its position. The clear wish of that consortium is to pick up the club from administration rather than liquidation, but it is now involved in a battle against the clock. Ally McCoist, the Rangers manager, has been asked to be involved in the sale of the club. He said: \"There are may be one or two people out there who are underestimating the situation, but it should not be underestimated. We are in a very serious predicament but we are still fighting for our lives and we'll continue to do that. \"I think the sale of the club has always been a measure that everybody knew would become inevitable, but what maybe wasn't inevitable has been the speed of it.\"",

Just a pipe dream so far. The man puffing hardest on the briar is Vince Cable, Lib Dem MP and coalition business secretary. And who would it affect? Anyone with a home worth over \u00a32m.

      "bodyText": "Turn back the clocks and rewind history for International Women's Day today. This marks the first era in living memory that British women's freedoms have gone into reverse, as women pay the heaviest price for government policies. Intentionally or not, a male breadwinner with a dependent woman carer at home is the model on which the cuts are crafted, removing the supports to independence and sending women home. \"The most family-friendly government ever\" \u2013 promised at election time \u2013 is in retreat. \"Calm down dear,\" Cameron said to one protesting woman MP, but Ipsos Mori finds women's support for him waning, less contented with him, more dissatisfied with how his government is running the country. \"We are putting women at the heart of the economic future,\" reads the government briefing for Women's Day, but that might surprise the mothers who have given up work, unable to pay for childcare that rose another 6% this year. The \u00a3910 cut in childcare credits and shrinking support for the elderly means women leaving work, even though losing that foothold jeopardises their future security. Women do twice as much unpaid caring as men, so when the safety nets go, so does their independence. Of the 710,000 public employees cut, 65% are women. Since women progress higher up the ladder in the public sector, expect their overall professional status to fall. Cameron calls for more women in the boardroom \u2013 only 14% now \u2013 but he opposes EU plans for quotas. If his government seems blind to women, it doesn't help that he has appointed only 21 women out of 119 ministers. Women earn less, own less, have less secure jobs, with three times more men than women earning in the top 10%. The pay gap has narrowed annually for a generation, though women still earn 15.5% less than men. But for the first time in decades that gap is set to widen as losing public sector jobs where pay is far more equal tips the balance. Lib Dem raising of the tax threshold does least for women, as many earn below tax levels, but lose multiples more in benefit and credits. Women were predestined to be the great losers once the government decided to shrink the deficit with 80% spending cuts and only 20% tax cuts: women pay less tax and use more services. Of the \u00a318bn cut from benefits, \u00a311bn comes from women's pockets, according to the IFS and the Fawcett Society. Single mothers take the worst hit, their incomes falling 8.5%. When the new universal credit comes in, 500,000 single parents will be losers, but women in couples fare badly too: universal credit will send many wives home, removing any incentive for a partner to earn extra. Bolstering that retro male breadwinner ideal, the money will mainly go to men, ignoring all previous evidence that men spend it less on children. Winning rights in divorce has taken women decades, but wives will be powerless when they lose legal aid. For custody of their children and sharing assets, they must defend themselves in court while husbands may afford lawyers. This week's NAO report shows that more than half of parents (mainly mothers) who have care of children in separated families receive no child maintenance. The fathers' rebellion against paying finally wins the day as the government tells families to \"sort it out for themselves\". For mothers who ask CMEC, the child support agency, to help secure maintenance for them, about 80% receive child support; yet this will now depend on women paying a 12% commission from their average \u00a330 a week payments. Half the women suffering domestic violence will lose legal aid as qualifying rules tighten. Women's refuges, severely cut, report turning away 230 women a day with nowhere to send them. Expect teenage pregnancies to rise after falling 24% since 1998: in recent years the teenage pregnancy strategy finally discovered what worked. But that's wound up, with smaller funds dispersed unringfenced to councils. Where is the good news? The government launches a violence against women action plan on Thursday. More flexible parental leave is promised for 2015. A body-image teaching pack is available to primary schools. \"The government is making a real difference to women's lives,\" says the briefing \u2013 and indeed it is. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that only 12% of planned cuts have happened, so for women the worst is yet to come. It is good news, though, that women are responding, joining Fawcett, UK Feminista, Gingerbread and Object. Young women are indignant at backsliding public imagery, the airbrushing, pornification, lap-dancing and unchecked laddishness driving girls to anorexia and self-loathing. Last year's Slutwalk protest spread around the world, protesting against rape and the blaming of women, after a Canadian police chief said: \"Women should avoid dressing like sluts.\" Culture is not beyond the reach of governments, but they need to set the tone starting with their own deep attitudes towards equality. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2012. The original said that CMEC was failing to get child maintenance payments for more than half of mothers. The figure of 50% plus applies to a much wider population group, not just those who have asked the CMEC for help securing maintenance. The relevant paragraph in the text has been corrected and extended.",

      "bodyText": "Wednesday's iPad3 launch had a wider purpose than introducing an upgraded tablet. It was Apple's most coherent effort yet to bind its family of screens closer together, in a way that lays the ground for the world's largest technology company to disrupt the world's most important entertainment medium \u2013 broadcasting. Tim Cook introduced his concept of the \"post-PC era\". With growing numbers of tablet computers, smartphones, the humble desktop computer is no longer the centre of our digital world. All our screens have become computers, and that revolution is coming to the television set. A quarter of TV sets being sold today have an internet connection. Apple has yet to reveal a TV set of its own, contenting itself today with an upgrade to its set-top box, know as Apple TV, which has been on sale for some years now but hooks up to your existing screen rather than an Apple-made display. Some of the improvements to Apple TV and the iPad3 are about preparing for that event. First of these is high definition. Real HD sets have 1080 lines of vertical resolution. Apple TV's resolution has been improved, from 720p to 1080p. The iPad 3 will be able to take 1080p video and photos. The second is an expansion of the iCloud media storage service. This holds any content purchased from iTunes, or uploaded from your PC, in Apple's servers. The advantage is that your library of photos, videos and music are available on any Apple device, from phones to the television set. The service already stores photos, TV shows and music. From today it will also store movies bought on the iTunes store. Another binding technology we already know about is AirPlay, included in Apple's latest operating systems. This streams images from a phone, PC or a tablet onto a TV set. The Apple devices are increasingly able to produce and share high definition content, the kind of material that looks good on the biggest screen in the living room. Apple TV is a rare misfire, it came to market in 2007 and has sold just over 4m units. Paltry compared to 55m iPads in two years. After its latest upgrade, Apple TV can now be seen as a sleeper device, a hint of its maker's vision for the reinvention of broadcasting, and a test-bed for bigger things to come. Correction: this piece was originally wrongly credited to Charles Arthur. The author is Juliette Garside.",

      "bodyText": "Mayfair property tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz has accused one of his oldest friends of attempting to hijack a multimillion pound legal dispute by including a catalogue of allegations designed to embarrass him. Keyvan Rahimian had been a family friend of Tchenguiz since the two were children growing up in pre-revolution Tehran, and years later went to work for Tchenguiz's UK property empire. The two were so close Rahimian socialised regularly with Tchenguiz and lived in his home for about nine years. Rahimian told the high court in London they had been \"akin to brothers\" before a bitter falling out in late 2008. The two men have lodged legal claims against one another, with Rahimian claiming Tchenguiz failed to honour commission payments on certain property deals and Tchenguiz claiming Rahimian had failed to account for investments he was supposed to have made using funds from the property baron. Rahimian claims to be owed \u00a36.7m, while Tchenguiz says he is due more than \u00a32m. In their opening submission to the court, Tchenguiz's lawyers said: \"It has become increasingly apparent from both correspondence and then [Rahimian's] witness statement that it is intended to fight the case at least in part on other grounds.\" In particular the lawyers pointed to a series of allegations they argued were \"tangential\" and which Rahimian \"has plainly sought to make reference to \u2026 in the belief they will secure him advantage either before or during the trial.\" Specifically, there is a reference to allegations, allegedly put by Rahimian in \"salacious terms\", that models were recruited to attend Tchenguiz's parties. In response to this point, the property tycoon's lawyers told the court: \"The claimant seeks to put in evidence matters that are of no relevance but are asserted to be embarrassing.\" Tchenguiz's legal team also dismissed as \"patently ridiculous\" allegations that certain payments to Rahimian had been made \"to keep him sweet\". They added that Rahimian's witness statement, which had not yet been made a public document, \"contains [further] allegations which are wholly irrelevant to the issues, but rather consist of innuendo about [Tchenguiz].\" Mention of Conservative former culture minister David Mellor, once a consultant for the Tchenguiz businesses, was described as being of \"no identifiable relevance to any pleaded issue but seems designed merely to increase the media profile of the trial\". The dispute over sums realised from share trading carried out on behalf of Tchenguiz relate to past dealings in stocks including Bramdean Alternatives, the fund management group run by Nicola Horlick. Tchenguiz had close to 30% of shares in this company, but his lawyers are confident there is no suggestion the inclusion of trading Rahimian was instructed to carry out would have pushed him over this threshold. Stock market rules require investors holding 30% of more of a company's shares to make an offer for the entire company. Rahimian had also been instructed to acquire shares in Australian-listed Challenger Infrastructure Fund, a business established by the late media tycoon James Packer in which Tchenguiz already had a large stake. The case continues.",

      "bodyText": "Drugs for Alzheimer's disease, which were the subject of a massive row when they were restricted only to NHS patients with moderate symptoms, carry on working even on people in the severe stage of the illness, a study has shown. The controversy over donepezil (Aricept) and other similar drugs ended up in the high court in 2007. Drug manufacturers Eisai took Nice, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, to judicial review, with the support of the Alzheimer's Society, which was outraged that people in the early stage of the disease were not eligible. The court found against Nice on only one out of six allegations, but later Nice reviewed the guidance and amended it so that people in the early stages, with mild symptoms, could also have treatment. Evidence on what the drugs could do for people in the later stages of disease, however, has been lacking. They were not included in the trials run by the pharmaceutical companies. The Medical Research Council and the Alzheimer's Society stepped into the breach. The study they funded, led by Professor Robert Howard from the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, has concluded that the drugs carry on working in people whose illness has become severe. \"For the first time, we have robust and compelling evidence that treatment with these drugs can continue to help patients at the later, more severe stages of the disease,\" he said. \"We observed that patients who continued taking donepezil were better able to remember, understand, communicate and perform daily tasks for at least a year longer than those who stopped taking the drugs. These improvements were noticeable to patients, their caregivers and doctors.\" The drugs are not a cure. All the 295 patients in the trial continued to get worse, but the downhill progress was slowest in those who were given both donepezil and a second similar drug, mementine. Those who were given only placebos did worse. Researchers measured not only patients' scores on tests of their thinking and memory, but also their ability to dress themselves and do normal everyday things, which generally have far more impact on their lives and those of their carers. A slowdown in decline was seen even in people who were on the dummy pills. \"The difficulty with the dementia drugs is that they have a massive placebo effect,\" said Professor Nick Fox, senior MRC clinical fellow at the Institute of Neurology, University College London. \"But we know we are seeing much more than an emotional attachment to the drugs \u2013 we are seeing real benefit.\" What is really needed, however, are new drugs which can check or cure the disease, rather than relieving symptoms, said Fox. Those are not in sight. \"We desperately need more funding to crack this problem, which will affect probably a third of all of us,\" he said. \"We need a commitment from government, working in partnership with charities, using the fantastic resources of the NHS to really improve resources to find treatments for these devastating diseases.\" Around 750,000 people in the UK and 18 million worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease. The study shows the drugs could benefit twice as many people as they do at the moment. Donepezil will shortly go out of patent. Generic versions will cut the \u00a32.50 a day price tag to something like 80p, making it more affordable for the NHS. In a statement, Nice said that although its guidance stated the drugs should be given for those with mild to moderate disease, it also said they should be continued as long as they were having a worthwhile effect.",

Drug manufacturers Eisai took Nice, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, to judicial review, with the support of the Alzheimer's Society, which was outraged that people in the early stage of the disease were not eligible.</p> <p>The court found against Nice on only one out of six allegations, but later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/06/alzheimers-drugs-nhs-government\" title=\"\">Nice reviewed the guidance </a>and amended it so that people in the early stages, with mild symptoms, could also have treatment.</p> <p>Evidence on what the drugs could do for people in the later stages of disease, however, has been lacking. They were not included in the trials run by the pharmaceutical companies. The Medical Research Council and the Alzheimer's Society stepped into the breach.</p> <p>The study they funded, led by Professor Robert Howard from the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London, and published in the <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/\" title=\"\">New England Journal of Medicine</a>, has concluded that the drugs carry on working in people whose illness has become severe.</p> <p>\"For the first time, we have robust and compelling evidence that treatment with these drugs can continue to help patients at the later, more severe stages of the disease,\" he said. \"We observed that patients who continued taking donepezil were better able to remember, understand, communicate and perform daily tasks for at least a year longer than those who stopped taking the drugs. These improvements were noticeable to patients, their caregivers and doctors.\"</p> <p>The drugs are not a cure.

      "bodyText": "'Sometimes it feels like one song could be a whole record, a whole world unto itself,\" Andrew Bird says, sitting in his darkened hotel room, wearing two scarves and sniffing at the cold London weather. There are a number of strange and wonderful worlds on the singer-songwriter's most recent album, Break It Yourself: where clouds merge into mountains, where there are holes in the ocean floor, and refrains written for frog puppets \u2013 as well as rhythms that carry the flavour of Morocco, the Caribbean and America's deep south. Building these worlds can take time. After touring his fifth album, 2009's Noble Beast, Bird, a multi-instrumentalist famed for his whistling, sublime violin-playing and the near-jabberwocky of his lyrics, stumbled into a kind of sabbatical. \"I was burned out, and I didn't really want to go home to Illinois,\" he says. \"So I stopped on the west coast, on my way back from Asia, and rented a house in Venice Beach, rode my bike around and wrote a bunch of songs for the Muppet movie.\" Bird's only previous experience of scoring for film had been on the indie flick Norman. Writing for Jim Henson's menagerie was a different task. \"It was all on spec,\" Bird says. \"They have probably 20 writers, and there's no guarantee your songs will be used. But you're writing for the love of the challenge of writing for the Muppets. And there's something satisfying about it, about feeling like a real writer.\" Not all of Bird's Muppet compositions made their way into the soundtrack, but he was able to use \"little bits and pieces\" of those that weren't chosen. \"Even if I'm writing about the Muppets, I'm putting my spin on things,\" he says. \"One song in particular, Lazy Projector, is about selective memory, deciding how we remember a certain relationship \u2013 who's putting that story together, who's omitting certain things. I had this song I wrote for Kermit about why the Muppets broke up, and I added [Lazy Projector] on to give the song a lift at the end.\" He smiles faintly. \"If it's a slight non sequitur, that's OK with me. I'm not a linear songwriter.\" After his California sabbatical, Bird headed home to his barn outside Chicago to run through the new songs with his band. Remarkably, that first ad-hoc try-out provided the meat of the finished record. \"They were glorified rehearsals, jam sessions. You hope you'll get something out of that, but I didn't think any of it would be so complete after eight days. And, through the ebb and flow of each day, you get different performances out of yourself. The morning songs are the kind of agitated ones, and then you get the late-night, falling-off-a-chair performances.\" This fluid recording environment makes for a record that, while still a little wistful, is strikingly happy. \"I was just in a good place in my head after a long time of not being,\" is how Bird explains it. One imagines his marriage and the birth of his son in the years since Noble Beast may well have been a factor; indeed, on one track, there is a brief sample of his son merrily burbling away. The most notable difference between the new album and his previous work is the more complex approach to rhythm. He refers to its \"polyrhythmic loops\" and \"really odd basslines\", and to a track called Orpheo Looks Back, the only song not recorded live. \"It was constructed from two free-jazz solo loops I had worked on and recorded, and which happened to be close enough in tempo to layer. The song sounds a little north African, and that section I wrote in Venice Beach. When I hear something in my head, I hammer away at it for hours and hours until it works.\" He thinks the exuberant Danse Caribe is the album's \"most stylistically clear song. I've always been interested by music from the American south into the Caribbean, down to Haiti,\" he says. \"And maybe that song didn't go in the direction I was hoping, which would have been more like a stomp \u2013 it went more Afropop. But that's fine. It's hard not to have a blast playing that kind of music, because it's only three chords and it's really joyful.\" Does this signal a change of direction? He gives a slow shake of his head. \"I wouldn't want to make it a direct homage, I just want to feel it under my skin. But [Afropop] is one of the most elusive rhythms to recreate. I can always conjure other types of music, but that requires a state of mind you can't always harness.\" How does he get himself into the right mindset? \"You have to be very open. You stumble upon it. It can't be pieced together by physical memory. Some people find that frustrating, but I like that \u2013 one day it's there and the next day it's not. That's what makes me get up in the morning.\" \u2022 Andrew Bird tours the UK in June and plays the Roundhouse, London NW1, on 8 November.",

But since the Guardian revealed plans to privatise the police, that has changed. I set up the Twitter hashtag #keepthepolicepublic and was inundated with tweets as the public, unions and even serving police officers rallied to the campaign. When officers tweet that they've \"never backed you before but they're behind you on this one\", you can sense the anger out there. We cannot sit idly by and allow West Midlands and Surrey police forces to tender out a \u00a31.5bn contract to potentially outsource responsibility for investigating crimes, patrolling neighbourhoods and detaining suspects to the private sector. While it is true that Labour introduced the Police Reform Act in 2002 \u2013 which allowed chief constables to grant limited powers to non-police organisations to contribute towards community safety \u2013 it was never our intention to see private security firms patrolling our public streets. The West Midlands and Surrey police proposals extend much further than their operational responsibilities. To potentially hand policing patrols to private security firms driven by profit and a return for the shareholders is a strategic decision that will massively affect public confidence in the police. What's more, this is being done with absolutely no public consultation, other than inside the Association of Chief Police Officers \u2013 as if it were just an operational matter. The coalition has made a big play of police and crime commissioners being the voice of the people to provide greater transparency and accountability for the force. But nine months before the PCC elections, the government is allowing forces to contract out essential frontline services without any electoral mandate, denying the people a say in this fundamental change to our police. The former Met commissioner Ian Blair, a man I respect, argued in these pages that, while it is being done through the prism of government cuts, outsourcing \"signals a shift that would allow the private sector to provide staff who can carry out routine and repetitive tasks at cheaper rates\". But if you look at the tender contract it's clear these tasks are more than that \u2013 it's \"patrolling neighbourhoods\" \"investigating crimes\" and \"responding to incidents\". This isn't backroom. It's frontline, public-facing policing. I have grave concerns about allowing the private sector to encroach further into our judicial system. In 1993 the last Tory government gave a multimillion-pound five-year prison escort contract to Group 4 (now G4S). Within a week, four prisoners escaped. This company is pitching for the new policing contracts. If G4S wins, who will it be accountable to? The chief constable, the police and crime commissioner, or its own shareholders? PCCs will have the power to sack chief constables but will they be able to cancel private security contracts? Would private police come under the scrutiny and sanction of the Independent Police Complaints Commission? This is not a minor operational matter to be discussed just by Acpo and unelected chief constables. It requires an urgent nationwide debate in parliament and the community. People power forced this government to halt its NHS plans to allow a \"listening exercise\". It's time for us to force them to listen again. Police officers and members of the public should lobby their MPs and local police authorities to let them know that contracting out essential frontline services is not negotiable. It is a thin blue line that the private sector must not cross. We can't have this government selling off bobbies to save a few coppers.",

A weak-willed display against lowly Watford left them with a single frustrating point to show for their tame efforts \u2013 and the hard-to-please natives seriously restless. Victory would have taken West Ham above Southampton. Instead, they remain one point below the leaders from the south coast and two points clear of Reading in third place. But for an 87th-minute equaliser from Ricardo Vaz T\u00ea, a substitute, they would have been embarrassed further. The Portuguese forward drove home through a crowd of bodies, the ball going in off a post, but West Ham could not find a winner in the nine minutes of stoppage time added by the referee following a double injury. A chorus of boos from their fans followed. Home-not-so-sweet home has been the main headache this season, with West Ham dropping 19 points on their own turf. \"We just can't find our cutting edge at Upton Park,\" said Sam Allardyce, their manager. \"Basically, we've got to do the same at home as we've been doing away. We've got to be more clinical. We're just not showing enough quality here and we nearly paid the price for that. But at least we showed the desire and the ability to claw our way back into it.\" West Ham under Allardyce might not please the East End purists \u2013 only rarely are the club now referred to as the \"Academy of Football\" \u2013 but their style, if not easy on the eye, is normally effective. They beat Watford 4-0 at Vicarage Road back in August and went into the return encounter on a five-match unbeaten run, which appeared to have been sparked by their 5-1 hammering by Ipswich Town at Portman Road at the end of January. They could have been in front with less than a minute on the clock. Matt Taylor, returning from a three-match suspension, took aim from 30 yards and sent a shot thundering against the crossbar. Tomasz Kuszczak, the Watford goalkeeper, barely saw it. Julien Faubert should have done better when miscuing a Taylor cross and Kuszczak had to work minor miracles to keep out efforts from Mark Noble, after a clever back-heel from Carlton Cole, and James Tomkins. But for all their earnest endeavours, West Ham could not break through, and what little rhythm they had was disrupted soon after the interval. A clash of heads between John Eustace and Dale Bennett, Watford team-mates, forced a seven-minute delay. Eustace left the pitch, returning with a large bandage on his head, but Bennett, his neck in a brace, was taken off on a stretcher and then to hospital. \"We suspect it's not as serious as it looked,\" Sean Dyche, the Watford manager, said. \"We're waiting on the doctors to see if he'll be kept in overnight.\" Watford responded better after the resumption, and Sean Murray drilled home a cross-shot via the far post and a deflection off Abdoulaye Faye. Vaz T\u00ea's late intervention just about prevented open rebellion among the home crowd. Failure to beat Doncaster Rovers at the same venue on Saturday, though, and the mood could get ugly.",

      "bodyText": "In business it's all about the bottom line, and for the American entrepreneur Sara Blakely, banishing unsightly bulges and the curse of VPL (visible panty lines) has proved her ticket into the ranks of the world's super rich. Blakely has made her debut on Forbes magazine's list of world billionaires thanks to the success of her underwear empire, Spanx. The 41-year-old joins an elite, global cast, mostly male, which includes Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, and investment guru Warren Buffett. The richest woman on the list is Christy Walton, who inherited her $25bn (\u00a316bn) fortune from her late husband John, a member of the Walmart dynasty. Blakely's eureka moment came when she spotted a gap in the market after being unable to buy underwear that would avoid VPL under her cream-coloured trousers. She ended up cutting the feet out of a pair of tights, and, hey presto, the so-called power-pants phenomenon was born. There is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that not all women find Spanx pants comfortable, in the Guardian's office at least: quite the reverse. But you can't argue with the figures. Spanx now has annual sales of $250m and a range of more than 200 products that include armpit-high shorts and whole bodysuit girdles in three grades of suction \u2013 medium, super and super-duper. The Atlanta-based firm, which employs 125 staff, with only 16 men among them, has as its motto: \"Changing the world one butt at a time.\" Spanx's success has now launched Blakely on to the celebrity circuit, with Oprah Winfrey \u2013 ranked 442nd richest person in the world with a $2.7bn fortune \u2013 one of her biggest fans. Indeed, her success is partly due to Winfrey, who described Spanx as among her \"favourite things of 2000\" on her chat show and sent a film crew to profile Blakely. Thousands of orders rolled in as the video was aired, and the top US department store Neiman Marcus and its rivals clamoured for stock. Other A-listers such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Beyonc\u00e9 and Eva Longoria admitted turning to Spanx to boost the wow factor on the red carpet. And not only female stars rely on Spanx to offer \"tummy taming, thigh trimming and butt boosting\" improvements. Blakely saw the opportunity to double her customer base after Hollywood agents started requesting extra-large sizes, and it became clear that male stars were also relying on the clothing's suction powers to help them cut it in a tuxedo. Men can now buy \"hold it in\" T-shirts that the firm claims enable chaps to \"look sharper, stand taller and feel stronger\". Blakely's path to success was not without personal risk. At 29, the entrepreneur, whose early career included a stint as a Disney World ride greeter, ploughed her $5,000 life savings into developing the prototype pants. At the time she was a photocopier sales rep and moonlighting stand-up comedian. The business was at first run from her spare room. She says success \"wasn't easy\" and recounts taking a week off in 2000 to drive through North Carolina to persuade hosiery makers to embrace her idea. \"I was shocked that only men seemed to make women's undergarments,\" she told one interviewer, recalling dozens of cold calls to textile mills across the south. \"They all thought I was crazy.\" Numerous knock-backs later, a manufacturer relented only when Blakely's ideas got the backing of his two daughters. Today, Forbes and Wall Street put Blakely's net worth at about $1bn; she ranks 1,153 of 1,226 on the Forbes list, level-pegging with Britain's Carphone Warehouse billionaire, Charles Dunstone. Blakely, who is the advertising face and body of Spanx as well as its chief executive, also still owns 100% of the company. She has no outside investors, no bank debts. The runaway success of Spanx in the past decade means she is also crowned, by Forbes, the youngest female self-made billionaire in the world. Spanx's owner is not the only underwear tycoon to join the billionaire club this year. Kevin Plank, head of Under Armour, also makes his debut. In the early 1990s he began with the idea of a sweat-soaking sports T-shirt. By 1996, aged 23, he had founded the firm from his grandmother's basement with $16,000 in cash and $40,000 on credit cards. He expanded into sports bras and basketball shoes. Forbes puts his net worth at $1.1bn. Like Spanx, the Baltimore firm has spawned hundreds of imitations. High- street chains such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Blacks produce girdles and long johns in the image of these US brands.",

      "bodyText": "The British mission in Afghanistan will continue despite the loss of six soldiers who were caught in a huge explosion that destroyed their armoured vehicle, defence officials have said. If, as expected, the men are confirmed to have been killed in the blast, it will take the death toll of British personnel killed in Afghanistan to 404. It will also represent the biggest single loss of UK life in a single incident in Afghanistan since 2006, when an ageing RAF Nimrod crashed in the country shortly after mid-air refuelling, with the loss of all 14 people aboard. Passing the symbolic milestone of 400 deaths would refocus attention on the reason for the presence of British troops in Afghanistan, the timetable for their removal and the capability of the Afghan army and police force to keep the country secure once coalition troops have left. Defence officials said the deaths would have no effect on strategy or tactics deployed by British troops. If anything, it would encourage military commanders to stay the course, they said. However, officials indicated ministers were well aware of war weariness among the public. An investigation is under way to find out what caused the explosion that wrecked the Warrior vehicle as it patrolled the border of Helmand and Kandahar in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday. The force of the blast led to early speculation that the vehicle was hit by an old mine, possibly from the Soviet era, but an initial examination of the Warrior suggested it was probably a large Taliban roadside bomb. The bodies of the soldiers were still being extracted from the wreckage last night in an operation hampered by bad weather, defence officials said. The soldiers are expected to be named on Thursday. David Cameron described the loss of the men \u2013 who were described by the Ministry of Defence as missing, believed killed \u2013 as a \"desperately sad day for our country\". He said it was a \"reminder of the huge price that we are paying for the work we are doing in Afghanistan and the sacrifice that our troops have made and continue to make\". But the prime minister pointed out that the men were carrying out important work to prevent Afghanistan becoming a haven for al-Qaida to plan attacks on the UK or its allies. Five of the soldiers presumed dead were from the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and one from the 1st Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment. At Battlesbury barracks in Warminster, Wiltshire, where the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment is based, the news was broken to families and friends of the missing men. Service personnel past and present, army families and townsfolk arrived at the gates to lay flowers and express their sadness. Stacey McLaughlin, 21, whose husband, John, is to fly to Afghanistan in April laid flowers with their daughter, three-year-old Olivia-Mai. Speaking through tears, she said: \"They are true heroes. This loss will be felt badly by all the soldiers out there and the families back home. I just hope John comes back home safely when he goes out there.\" Hayley Dymek, 22, whose husband, Private Darren Dymek, 24, is in Afghanistan with the Yorkshire regiment, said: \"I panicked this morning when I first heard that six soldiers had been killed. But then I found out that the families had been informed, so I knew Darren was safe. This really brings home the dangers of what they are doing out there.\" Downing Street said last month that British troops would end their lead combat role in Afghanistan by the end of next year. This will lead to Afghan security forces being in sole charge of combat operations against insurgents by the end of 2014, when most of Britain's 9,500-strong contingent will have returned home. The timeframe may well be shortened at the Nato summit in Chicago in May. However, Nato commanders in Afghanistan have told Downing Street and the White House that they want to keep levels of International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) as high as possible between now and the end of the \"fighting season\" next year \u2013 September 2013. They insist this is the best way of ensuring the country does not descend into chaos before the final withdrawal of combat troops. If Cameron agreed to Nato's proposal, about 9,000 UK troops would remain in Helmand until autumn next year. They would be under more pressure too. Sixteen thousand US Marines are withdrawing from Helmand within months, and although Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, has said Britain would not \"backfill\", Afghan forces are unlikely to be able to shoulder the burden of security alone. Privately, commanders also warn the Isaf coalition could disintegrate if either country signals an early exit. \"That is the biggest danger for Afghanista,\" said one. \"A hasty and chaotic exit must be avoided.\" But political pressure is mounting on both sides of the Atlantic to accelerate the drawdown. The loss of the British soldiers this week is bound to raise questions about their resources. Cameron accepted there was a need to make sure personnel had all the equipment they needed to keep them \"as safe as possible\". But the MoD was quick to quash suggestions that the vulnerability of the Warrior could be blamed for the deaths. Warrior had been upgraded throughout its service in Iraq and Afghanistan to try to combat the threat from roadside bombs and mines. A \u00a31bn upgrade of the vehicle was announced at the end of last year to extend the life of the vehicle to 2040 and beyond but the MoD stressed this was not in response to \"any identified deficiencies\" in its armour. A spokesman said: \"Warrior provides some of the highest levels of protection available but sadly no armoured vehicle can provide absolute protection from the very largest explosions.\" The chief of the defence staff, General Sir David Richards, said the men were doing \"a dangerous but important job\", adding: \"Increasingly the Afghans themselves are taking the lead in providing security across Helmand. This transition is allowing Afghans to gain the confidence to reject the Taliban and live normal lives.\" Some experts remain unconvinced. Gareth Price, senior research fellow on the Asia programme at Chatham House, suggested the explosion could have been designed to send a message to the Afghan people that the national army could not guarantee their safety. Anthony Glees, director of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of Buckingham, said: \"The fact that these people were killed by an IED (improvised explosive device) might suggest not just that this is a very dangerous place but that the Afghans aren't particularly good at delivering security.\"",

He said it was a \"reminder of the huge price that we are paying for the work we are doing in Afghanistan and the sacrifice that our troops have made and continue to make\".</p> <p>But the prime minister pointed out that the men were carrying out important work to prevent Afghanistan becoming a haven for al-Qaida to plan attacks on the UK or its allies.</p> <p>Five of the soldiers presumed dead were from the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and one from the 1st Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.</p> <p>At Battlesbury barracks in Warminster, Wiltshire, where the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment is based, the news was broken to families and friends of the missing men.</p> <p>Service personnel past and present, army families and townsfolk arrived at the gates to lay flowers and express their sadness.</p> <p>Stacey McLaughlin, 21, whose husband, John, is to fly to Afghanistan in April laid flowers with their daughter, three-year-old Olivia-Mai. Speaking through tears, she said: \"They are true heroes. This loss will be felt badly by all the soldiers out there and the families back home. I just hope John comes back home safely when he goes out there.\"</p> <p>Hayley Dymek, 22, whose husband, Private Darren Dymek, 24, is in Afghanistan with the Yorkshire regiment, said: \"I panicked this morning when I first heard that six soldiers had been killed. But then I found out that the families had been informed, so I knew Darren was safe. This really brings home the dangers of what they are doing out there.\"</p> <p>Downing Street said last month that British troops would end their lead combat role in Afghanistan by the end of next year. This will lead to Afghan security forces being in sole charge of combat operations against insurgents by the end of 2014, when most of Britain's 9,500-strong contingent will have returned home. The timeframe may well be shortened at the Nato summit in Chicago in May.</p> <p>However, Nato commanders in Afghanistan have told Downing Street and the White House that they want to keep levels of International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) as high as possible between now and the end of the \"fighting season\" next year \u2013 September 2013.</p> <p>They insist this is the best way of ensuring the country does not descend into chaos before the final withdrawal of combat troops. If Cameron agreed to Nato's proposal, about 9,000 UK troops would remain in Helmand until autumn next year.</p> <p>They would be under more pressure too. Sixteen thousand US Marines are withdrawing from Helmand within months, and although Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, has said Britain would not \"backfill\", Afghan forces are unlikely to be able to shoulder the burden of security alone.</p> <p>Privately, commanders also warn the Isaf coalition could disintegrate if either country signals an early exit. \"That is the biggest danger for Afghanista,\" said one. \"A hasty and chaotic exit must be avoided.\" But political pressure is mounting on both sides of the Atlantic to accelerate the drawdown.</p> <p>The loss of the British soldiers this week is bound to raise questions about their resources. Cameron accepted there was a need to make sure personnel had all the equipment they needed to keep them \"as safe as possible\".</p> <p>But the MoD was quick to quash suggestions that the vulnerability of the Warrior could be blamed for the deaths. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/07/british-troop-deaths-afghanistan Warrior\" title=\"\">Warrior had been upgraded</a> throughout its service in Iraq and Afghanistan to try to combat the threat from roadside bombs and mines. A \u00a31bn upgrade of the vehicle was announced at the end of last year to extend the life of the vehicle to 2040 and beyond but the MoD stressed this was not in response to \"any identified deficiencies\" in its armour.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Warrior provides some of the highest levels of protection available but sadly no armoured vehicle can provide absolute protection from the very largest explosions.\"</p> <p>The chief of the defence staff, General Sir David Richards, said the men were doing \"a dangerous but important job\", adding: \"Increasingly the Afghans themselves are taking the lead in providing security across Helmand. This transition is allowing Afghans to gain the confidence to reject the Taliban and live normal lives.\"</p> <p>Some experts remain unconvinced. Gareth Price, senior research fellow on the Asia programme at Chatham House, suggested the explosion could have been designed to send a message to the Afghan people that the national army could not guarantee their safety.</p> <p>Anthony Glees, director of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of Buckingham, said: \"The fact that these people were killed by an IED (improvised explosive device) might suggest not just that this is a very dangerous place but that the Afghans aren't particularly good at delivering security.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tottenham Hotspur ended their own losing streak and the valiant resistance of Stevenage Borough to set up an FA Cup quarter-final with Bolton Wanderers, but this was a victory that came at a cost. With Tottenham's automatic Champions League qualification looking in jeopardy for the first time in a while as Arsenal rally, Michael Dawson and Aaron Lennon suffered injuries that will prevent them from contributing at a key period in the campaign. Dawson's injury, which forced him off after eight minutes, is thought to be serious, with Harry Redknapp saying \"it would be a miracle if he came back before the end of the season\". The manager added: \"He did both his ankle and his knee and it doesn't look good.\" Lennon damaged a hamstring, the same problem that has caused him to miss parts of this season. Those losses were the only significant blots on an evening that started alarmingly for Redknapp, as Stevenage opened the scoring in the fourth minute, but concluded with a deserved win. It also featured a timely reminder of Jermain Defoe's finishing prowess as the striker who has fallen down the pecking order since the surprise signing of Louis Saha in January scored two splendid goals to increase his tally for the season to 15 from 29 games, only 17 of them starts. Redknapp suggested that although that strike rate is not enough to earn him a regular start for Spurs, it should secure him a spot in England's Euro 2012 squad. \"There are not many top strikers around \u2013 if there's a problem area in the [England] team, that's it. He's right up there with the best of them so he must have a great chance [of being selected].\" Redknapp, of course, may be doing that selecting but his more immediate concern ahead of this game was getting Spurs' season back on track after the draw at the Lamex Stadium and heavy league defeats to Arsenal and Manchester United. To do that he deployed a strong team, with Gareth Bale, Scott Parker and Rafael van der Vaart among the starters. None of which stopped Stevenage from seizing an early lead. Ryan Nelsen caught Joel Byrom late as the midfielder dashed into the box and the referee, Michael Oliver, awarded a penalty. Byrom got up to send Carlo Cudicini the wrong way. Tottenham's woe deepened when Dawson was carried off on a stretcher minutes later, a leg buckling as he landed after an aerial challenge. Stevenage were proving accomplished opponents, their crisp passing and athletic vigilance warning Spurs that a comeback would not come easily. And they almost doubled their lead in the 25th minute, when Jon Ashton met a long free-kick, but his header narrowly missed the target. Within seconds Tottenham had their first shot \u2013 and the equaliser. Bale picked out Defoe with a 60-yard pass that the striker trapped with one touch before firing a fine low shot past Chris Day from just outside the area, delivering a concise reminder of his potency. Tottenham had the lion's share of possession as the half wore on, but they seldom threatened. Stevenage almost snatched the lead early in the second period as a corner caused chaos in the Spurs box and Mark Roberts stabbed the ball at goal from close range. Cudicini produced a smart save. Roberts' anguish at that miss was made worse in the 55th minute when his challenge led to Bale going down in the Stevenage box. Ade Adebayor converted the penalty. Bale almost made it 3-1 on the hour when he crashed a swerving shot off the crossbar from 25 yards. Stevenage, however, were not about to fold. Roberts was within inches of equalising with a powerful header in the 65th minute but it bounced off the underside of the bar and away. It took another superb finish from Defoe to banish the prospect of further shocks for Spurs. In the 75th minute he collected a throw-in from Bale, scampered into the box and guided a low shot past Day and into the bottom corner.",

      "bodyText": "I had been waiting with apprehension for our court date, Monday, at which Avram Ludwig and I would have to go on to trial. We were arrested on 18 October for standing on a sidewalk in Tribeca, though obeying the law, while informing Occupy protesters of their legal rights to walk peacefully in single file under the terms of the permit that was in force outside the Huffington Post GameChangers Awards that night. The allegations written on my summons were: \"At t/p/o [shorthand for the \"time and place of the offense\"] observed deft [defendant] refuse a lawful order to disburse [sic] (given by Lt Zielinski) from sidewalk that was provided for per [pedestrian] traffic at all times. Had permit issued for Huffington Post Games Changes allowing at least 5ft of unobstructed sidewalk, for pedestrians, but deft refused to comply.\" As you may recall, the NYPD had misinformed the Occupy protesters that night that the permit involved at the GameChangers event allowed no access to pedestrian protest. From my nerdy research, I knew that that was wrong. No such permit exists in all of New York City law. I had given a statement to Gideon Oliver, our attorney, pointing out that I was not able to obey the orders of the lieutenant in question to get off the street because I have such respect for the law in Manhattan that I could not comply with Lt Zielinski's command \u2013 a command I knew to be in violation of the permit law in question, which I had checked on. A Kafkaesque situation, surely. I could not be physically present; on our previous court date, on 5 January, Judge Neil Ross had given me one-time permission to fulfil a commitment I had made to lecture in Australia (joining Germaine Greer for a discussion on feminism held in the Sydney Opera House). Instead, Avram was permitted to appear on behalf of us both. The DA declined to represent the prosecution for our cases \u2013 a move that all of our lawyer friends, my lawyer and my co-defendant called \"highly unusual\". Avram Ludwig reported to me: \"We went to court; Judge Matthew A Sciarino presided. There were 40-50 young Occupy arrestees there, wearing T-shirts that said, \"We Are the 99%\" \u2013 jackets that read 'Revolution' \u2013 in full protest mode; as well as five or six older female protesters. Gideon Oliver and other lawyers from the New York City chapter of the National Lawyers' Guild (NLG/NYC) represented them.\" \"When the DA said, 'We decline involvement in this case,' even the judge looked surprised. The judge said, 'Case dismissed.' \"The other protest defendants there, who had all been arrested as we had, had had to come back for their trials. When our cases were dismissed, they were startled. They still faced trial. 'How could this be? Why?' A journalist, too, was there and his case was dismissed. \"The only possible reason for the different outcomes is that they don't want a trial that will get publicity. For other people who won't get in the news, it's a different story. A teenage high-school student who was in a crowd was told to move, but she physically couldn't. They yanked her out and threw her in the police van. People couldn't move to follow orders, so they were singled out for arrest. Those people still have to go to trial. It's pure harassment. \"It's obviously a double standard. It's all about media management.\" I called Oliver, who is president of the New York chapter of the National Lawyers' Guild. He had generously represented pro bono not only us, but also \u2013 together with other NLG/NYC lawyers \u2013 all of the Occupy arrests in Manhattan. Did he also see a double standard, I asked, or was this a normal course of justice? \"It was obviously a political decision on the part of the DA's office to be 'hands off' on your case. But there are thousands of Occupy and other protest arrest cases in New York where that doesn't happen \u2013 and it should. These people are forced to take pleas \u2013 forced to plead guilty when they are not guilty \u2013 and go on to trial, where they will be either acquitted or convicted.\" In other words, there were people in that courtroom whose actions were no less lawful than ours, who used their protected first amendment rights as we did, yet they are facing days and days of court appearances and possibly 15 days in jail. They would also be facing thousands of dollars in legal fees, were it not that the NYC NLG is representing all Occupy cases pro bono. \"In jail\", Oliver told me, probably means Rikers Island \u2013 a fact about which he had diplomatically not given me details before yesterday, had we been heading there as well \u2013 \"Which is a rough place. Not a place anybody wants to be spending time.\" So, what should we, as citizens, learn from this strange turn of events, in which Avram and I were free to go, while 50 young people and a few elderly women who were in the same courtroom, represented by the same lawyer, facing the same judge, for the same \"offenses\", were still being prosecuted \u2013 by the same DA who had stood down to see us released? \"The takeaway? Twofold,\" Oliver said: \"Public and media scrutiny does matter. The more light we shine on these arrests the better \u2013 not just in the protest context, but across the board. But we need to shine a light not just on charges from protests, such as 'disorderly conduct', but also on so-called 'quality of life' policies by the NYPD, such as stop-and-frisk programs that also police public space. \"These policies serve the interests of the 1%, and not the public \u2013 and exclude the public from occupying public space and using it for protected first amendment purposes.\" So, Avram and I aren't going to jail; but our fellow citizens, who simply did what we did and lawfully exercised their first amendment rights, still may do so \u2013 and face the violence of a spell in Rikers. Their cases, too, deserve media scrutiny.",

      "bodyText": "Preamble Hello. How many times have you seen your favourite film? Unless your answer is 'once', you'll probably agree that visual entertainment doesn't always need suspense. This includes of football. Not enough people appreciate the joy of watching old games in their entirety (the Spar ready meal for one and scalding tears of regret are optional). Sometimes, similarly, a live game can be alluring even if there's a complete lack of suspense. All of which is a long-winded way of saying: Barcelona, 3-1 up from the away leg, are approximately 100.00000000 per cent certain to finish the job against Bayer Leverkusen tonight, but there is still good reason to be excited about this match. We should enjoy this Barcelona side while we can, before Jose Mourinho reduces the entire club to a whimpering mess, precipitating a meltdown in which Pep Guardiola signs Mick Harford and asks Dave Bassett to marry him in a shambling post-match interview. They are maybe the most beautiful side ever to play this football thing, so think of each game as a gift, in which you get to marvel at the joy of Cesc; the Messianic brilliance; the Xavirotica; and, er, Carles Puyol. More importantly, every time you press F5 we become slightly more attractive to advertisers! Kick off is at 7.45pm I wonder if Xavi has any ham tonight? In the 1984-85 Cup Winners' Cup, with Barcelona 4-2 ahead from the away leg against Metz, their midfield star Bernd Schuster said he would \"give the Metz players some ham when they come to our place to thank them for the presents that they give us tonight\". You don't need me to tell you what happened next. One of the sad things about media training and all that is that players no longer come out with hilarious pre-match trash talk. Before Germany played unfancied Algeria in the 1982 World Cup, one German player promised to \"dedicate our seventh goal to our wives, and the eighth to our dogs\". Yep, Algeria won 2-1. Bring back trash talk! Team news Barcelona (4-2-1-3) Valdes; Alves, Pique, Mascherano, Adriano; Xavi, Busquets; Fabregas; Pedro, Messi, Iniesta. Subs: Pinto, Keita, Muniesa, Sergi, Bartra, Tello, Cuenca. Bayer Leverkusen (4-2-3-1) Leno; Castro, Schwaab, Toprak, Kadlec; Bender, Rolfes; Reinartz, Kiessling, Renato Augusto; Derdiyok. Subs: Giefer, Oczipka, Friedrich, Schurrie, Ortega, Zenga, Bellarabi. Referee Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway). This is wonderful: some footage of Lionel Messi before he was famous. Including a mesmeric 50-yard solo run. When he was six years old. Barcelona's home record this season P21 W18 D3 L0 F81 A11. You've got to feel sorry for the very young Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno, and not only if you want to shoehorn in a half-arsed Royksopp reference by calling him poor Leno. The players are in the tunnel. Leverkusen need snookers, and the match hasn't even started. Do you see what happens, Larry? Do you see what happens when you try to be like the man in the movies? (Thanks to Neill Brown for the link.) 1 min Leverkusen assume the position from right to left. They are in white; Barcelona are a blur of red and blue. 2 min \"A serious blemish on aforementioned beauty is the presence of Pedro 'rubbish touch for a tidy fella' Rodriguez, running about like a headless chicken sniffing for goals (doesn't make visual sense, I know, but there's a deeper truth in this image),\" says Phil Podolsky. \"Has there been a less classy player in Barcelona attack in recent memory? Even Guily was a better footballer, though shorn of Pedro's main strength, finishing.\" Wait till Pep signs Mick Harford and John Fashanu. 3 min Nothing has happened yet. On nights like these, when they fail to break through in the first 180 seconds, you do wonder whether Barcelona need a plan B, a Harford or a Fashanu. 4 min Dani Alves, chased Benny Hill-style by Kiessling, runs right across his own six-yard box with the ball. 5 min \"Interested to know if you think beating Barca by two away is the proverbial 'bigger ask' than beating Milan at home by four,\" says Gordon Struth. Oh definitely. Arsenal had a 2-3 per cent chance of victory; Leverkusen have a 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000001 per cent chance, if that. 6 min Busquets is fouled just outside the area, a fair way to the left. Messi scored an awesome goal from this angle recently, against Atletico Madrid, but this time it's Xavi to take. His free kick is deflected off the wall for a corner, which produces the square root of eff all. 7 min \"I love stats,\" says Ian McCourt, idly perusing his page 3 archive. \"Messi has played 149 games at Camp Nou and scored 124 goals. #Fact.\" Watch those hashtags, McCourt. 8 min Leverkusen touch the ball. Okay, it's a flick on from a punt forward by the keeper, but every touch counts. 11 min Leno makes a fine save from Messi to keep the score level. Messi ran down the right side of the box onto a lovely scooped pass from Fabregas, chested the ball down and raked a half-volley towards the near post that was beaten away by Leno. The rebound came to Pedro, whose 10-yard shot was desperately blocked by the sliding Castro. Superb defending. 12 min Rolfes is booked for a cynical tug on Iniesta. Xavi curls the resulting free-kick a couple of yards over the bar. Leno had it covered. 14 min \"Watching that Messi video I was struck by two things,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"One, that Leo has EXACTLY the same grin as Christian Bale c.Harsh Times, and Two, that he's not prone to flashiness, is he? He does spectacular things in an unspectacular way; he gets things done. Would it be asking too much for a bit more Ronaldinho/Cantona etc in his play?\" I know what you mean, although football genius has always been deceptively efficient. And that goal against Arsenal last year was as imaginative as anything you'll see for many a year. 16 min Barcelona are tiki-takaing the life out of Leverkusen, imperceptibly taking complete control of the game as they so often do between the 11th and 20th minutes. 17 min If you could pick one player in the history of the game to improve this Barcelona team, who would it be and why? It's tempting to pick a great keeper, but could Schmeichel/Yashin/whoever play football in the way that Valdes does? That's a pretty important requirement of a Barcelona keeper. Equally, many of history's great individual players would be too, well, individual for this side. Nilton Santos maybe? 19 min After a decent move involving Rolfes and Renato Augusto, Rolfes's long-range shot is blocked by Busquets. 20 min \"Can't open the video of Messi that you posted here in the U.S,\" says George Demas. \"There is a video on YouTube showing Messi at the age of five. Assuming it's the same one, it is amazing how focused he was even then.\" That's not quite the same one \u2013 this clip included him at the age of six, beating 74 boys and scoring \u2013 but they are equally scary. 23 min Iniesta hoodwinks Castro on the left and is brought down. Castro should have been booked, although it's a bit irritating to see Iniesta asking for a card for the second time tonight. 24 min The free-kick almost produces the first goal. It's swung in by Xavi, beats everyone in the area and is palmed away by Leno, diving to his left. That's a good save because he would have had one eye on Pique, who had got away from his marker but then missed his attempted header. GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 25) I was typing 'GOAL!' when he was 45 yards out. It's a sublime finish from Lionel Messi. With Leverkusen having a suicidally high line, almost on the halfway line in fact, Messi curved his run to get beyond the defence onto a straightforward through pass from deep by Xavi. He ran into the area, a little left of centre, and lifted a wonderful scoop over the outstretched left arm of Leno. For most players such a scoop shot would have been a risky finish, but Messi always works within the limitations of his talent. There are no limitations. 28 min \"Player to improve Barcelona?\" says Simon Frank. \"Stuart Pearce.\" Imagine how his Barcelona team-mates would react to this. They would be so appalled that they'd ask the ref for a card for their own player. 31 min Messi scurries into the box from the right, past the static Kadlec, and his shot is blocked well by Toprak. 32 min \"The mid-70s Bayern side played a style of fluid football that was completely underrated, and I reckon Beckenbauer could slot very nicely into the Barca central defence,\" says Andrew Mullinder. \"So, him, and Mick Harford, who would help them on the type of rainy Tuesday night at Stoke during which players like Messi and Pedro would obviously be completely useless.\" Beckenbauer is an excellent suggestion. Not even Barcelona's defenders can do this. 33 min Pedro, put through on goal by Xavi, is wrongly called offside. Oh well, they'll have another clear chance in a couple of minutes. 34 min Xavi blooters the ball over the bar from 25 yards. It took a slight deflection but the referee gave a goal kick. 35 min \"To answer your question, and not to bang on about him, but Ronaldinho (when he still tried) for Pedro, Zidane for Fabregas, I imagine John Charles would do a good job at the back. I think Cafu was better than Alves, and Best in for, errr, someone,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"I have ignored Maradona and Pele because that's an even less interesting than the ones I have made. It's called Lovejoy's Theorum. If you can only think of Maradona or Pele as a subjective footballing answer, you either are ... you know where I'm going.\" 36 min Is there anybody out there who seriously believes Pep Guardiola would even consider swapping all this for a load of egomaniacal, football-illiterate hasbeens? 38 min Barcelona are coasting. It's terrifying effortless. Leverkusen are struggling to keep pace with the shadows, never mind the actual Barcelona players. I don't think they've touched the ball for three or four minutes. 41 min \"As Cesc has managed to push his way in, I'd say a peak Platini would have made an improvement to the team (or at least not weakened),\" says Ben Dunn. \"Platini did everything Cesc can but with a Gallic panache hazed in filterless tobacco smoke as if he were the protagonist in a sexually charged incomprehensible black-and-white film.\" GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 42) For most players this would have been a sublime goal; for Messi it is utterly routine. We've seen him score this type of goal so many times before. He was found by a perceptive angled pass by Iniesta, just outside the area to the right of centre. He ran into the box and then across the area in a straight line, the ball never more than a few millimetres from his left foot. After dummying to shoot a couple of times, he placed the ball into the far corner. He made a difficult chance look offensively easy. 43 min Leno comes out bravely to smother Fabregas's stabbed shot. Moments later, Castro is booked for another hapless attempt to tackle Iniesta. Half time: Barcelona 2-0 Bayer Leverkusen See you in 10 minutes. Half time email \"Don't you think that some of the Laws of football limit the influence of skill in the game? For example, minimal substitutions and the lack of in-and-out privileges (temporary substitutions) make for tired and exhausted players, who don't play as well, are more likely to tackle poorly instead of defend well, and are more likely to get injured (taking their skills out of future games). And the older players (presumably smarter and more skilled) can't play as long. The no timeouts rule prevents managers from advising as needed. Penalties that are too easy to score in comparison to the denied 'goalscoring opportunity' can kill off an entire 90 minutes of hard work. And making a team play one man down for a severe foul, rather than simply punishing the individual, again can kill those 90 minutes. Then again, none of this seems to inhibit Barcelona. Maybe I'm just watching the wrong league.\" I'd maybe argue the opposite, that perhaps the rule changes have gone too far in favour of the attackers, and that as a result nobody in the world apart from Nemanja Vidic can bloody defend properly. I don't know, I'd have to think it through. I'd like to read a big essay on why defending has gone to seed, though. Oh, Stevie \"To improve the Barcelona team how about swop Messi himself for Joe Cole,\" says Mike Gibbons, \"who is as good if not better, or certainly was until recently?\" More half-time thoughts \"I have to defend Pedro the Canarian,\" says Ceci Marjakangas. \"I agree, he's not as magical to watch as Leo, or Cesc, or even Tello, but he's a hard worker. He's been but a shadow of himself for ages, though. Was Alexis not injured again, he'd be playing and not Pedro. The Bar\u00e7a docs are looking into what's ailing him because such a tough Chilean street player should not be off to the sick bay so often. They think it might have to do with his diet. Anyhow, with Villa injured as well, that only leaves Pep with Pedrito, or then the inexperienced youngsters Cuenca and Tello. But I agree, Pedro's not a favourite of mine, and he sounds like a chihuahua. I still think most teams in the Premier League would be very happy to sign him up.\" Tello looks extremely exciting, doesn't he. 46 min Barcelona kick off the second half. They lead 5-1 on aggregate. Can they hold on and make it through to the quarter finals? 47 min \"Richard Dunne would improve Barcelona - his wholehearted oafishness would humanize the team, and make it more relatable to mere mortals,\" says Hugh Collins. \"Their current level of superiority is at times a little hard to stomach. Just ask Jose Mourinho.\" 48 min Fabregas tries one pass too many. Iniesta, Fabregas and Messi shredded the defence in a blur of short first-time passes, with Messi's return ball putting Fabregas through on Leno. He could have shot but tried to square it to Iniesta, who had started the move on the touchline approximately 0.2 seconds earlier, and Schwaab cleared for a corner. GOAL! Barcelona 3-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 50) I'm sorry, but this is just ridiculous. It's not remotely fair. Barcelona should be handicapped, made to play with nine men, when Lionel Messi is in their side. He Messi has scored his eighth hat-trick of the season \u2013 his eighth hat-trick of the season \u2013 and this might be the best goal of the three. Again he ran beyond the defence onto a through pass, this time from Busquets. His first touch on the edge of the area was exquisite, but the covering Schwaab seemed to have forced him a little wide. Then Messi produced a glorious chip with his weaker right foot that arced over the head of Leno and plopped gently into the far corner. The extent and the efficiency of his genius is totally beyond our comprehension. 53 min No more Xaviesta porn tonight. Andres Iniesta, who played marvellously on the left of the front three, is replaced by the highly promising Tello, and Seydou Keita comes on for Xavi. 54 min Bayer Leverkusen almost reduce the aggregate deficit to 6-2. Derdiyok runs into the area down the left, bounces off Mascherano and then, from an absurd angle, dinks the ball over Valdes and right across the goalline. 55 min Leverkusen also make a double substitution: Derdiyok and Bender and replaced by Karim Bellarabi and Andre Schurrle. GOAL! Barcelona 4-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Tello 55) The 20-year-old Cristian Tello came on two minutes ago for his European debut; he's already scored. He ran down the left onto a delightful lobbed pass from Fabregas, headed the ball into the area and then, with his second touch, opened up his body to pass the ball calmly across Leno into the far corner. A lovely finish from a player who looks a serious prospect. GOAL! Barcelona 5-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 58) Messi has four. After some more rat-a-tat passing on the edge of the area, Pedro tries to slip the ball through to Messi. He's blocked off by two defenders and Leno comes to claim, but he's at full stretch and the ball slithers from his grasp. Messi, who kept running, passes the ball in from a very tight angle on the left of the six-yard box. 59 min I am less speech. 60 min \"Messi is Maradona meets Gerd Muller,\" says Mike Gibbons. \"200 in five seasons...sorry, 201 now.\" GOAL! Barcelona 6-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Tello 62) Poor Leno hoofs the post in disgust, because Barcelona have scored again. They break four on three, and Alves lifts a pass to Tello in space on the left side of the box. He takes a touch and passes it through the left hand of the sprawling Leno. He should probably have done better, but you can't really blame him for making mistakes in the face of this bombardment. 63 min Barcelona make their final substitution, with the young defender Marc Muniesa replacing Adriano. 64 min \"Football referees, like their counterparts in boxing, should be empowered to end contests early,\" says Ben Stanley. \"This is painful.\" 65 min Do you see what happens, Larry? Do you see what happens when you play a high line against Barcelona? 66 min Leverkusen make their final change, with Bastian Oczipka replacing Renato Augusto. 68 min \"How crazy is it,\" says Karl Thomas Meakin, \"that this Bar\u00e7a side almost certainly aren't going to win the league?\" It's Jose Mourinho's greatest achievement, followed by centuries of daylight, followed by that treble with Inter and the titles with Chelsea. It's mind-blowing to think that Mourinho won the title by February against perhaps the greatest team of all time. 71 min This is a case for the League Against Cruel Sports. Leverkusen haven't had a kick all night. 74 min \"I'd suggest Michael Laudrup (genuinely) and Preben Elkjaer (to get this mail published) would both improve this Barcelona side,\" says David Bartlett. Laudrup would be great on the left of the front three, with Iniesta back into midfield. 76 min Nothing much is happening. Barcelona seem to have declared at six. Leverkusen have certainly declared at minus six. 77 min \"I was going to write and agree with you about the decline of defending but then I remembered how much fun this season has been as well as some half-repressed flashes of the 2003 Champions League final and now I realize that we must track down Nemanja Vidic and purge the last remnants of that terrible curse from the earth,\" says Alex Hanton.. \"I assume Johan Cruyff has already done most of the legwork, possibly by battling a cyborg Helenio Herrera in the center of a rain-soaked Camp Nou, but he's getting on now and we all have to help out.\" What are you on about? That 2003 final was cerebral. 78 min \"I disagree...Bar\u00e7a have played Madrid five times this season and Madrid never beat them,\" says Finola Leggett. \"The fact that they are 10 points behind has more to do with Bar\u00e7a's mental fatigue and Spanish football politics than Mourinho's genius.\" Surely the fact even Mourinho's can't beat Barcelona makes his achievement in the league even greater, as it means he's had to secure an extra six points. Their margin for error is almost nonexistent. 79 min Almost a seventh goal. Pedro breaks the offside trap on the right of the box, and his low cross just evades the stretching Keita in front of an open goal. 81 min Fabregas's outswinging corner is headed wide by Keita, ten yards from goal at the near post. Mick Harford would have buried it. GOAL! Barcelona 7-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 85) Lionel Messi becomes the first man to score five goals in a Champions League match. It was another terrifyingly simple goal, passed into the corner at pace from the D. There's nothing left to say. 86 min \"In fairness Mourinho hasn't really managed to beat this Barca team,\" says Alex Hanton. \"He's just found a way of winning anyway. He's like the Roman general who worked out he couldn't beat Hannibal so just decided to burn everything within a 50-mile radius instead.\" He's still beaten them twice in big games, which is more than anyone else has managed. But his main achievement is to win almost every single other bloody match. People dismiss this on the grounds La Liga isn't great, but I don't see anyone else winning 22 games out of 25. He has raised the bar to a level that even Barcelona can't reach. 87 min Lionel Messi is 24 years old. 88 min \"In an age when sports stars are more and more physically impressive, am I right in thinking that Messi is about average height, average weight and average build?\" says Gary Naylor. \"In a police report, he'd have no distinguishing features, would he?\" 89 min That should have been a hat-trick on his debut, as a substitute, for Tello. Leverkusen won their first corner \u2013 which inevitably meant a chance for Barcelona about five seconds later. Fabregas broke and played a gentle through ball to Tello, whose shot was superbly saved by poor Leno. GOAL! Barcelona 7-1 Bayer Leverkusen (Bellarabi 90) This could be the very definition of the consolation goal. The substitute Karim Bellarabi plays a neat one-two with Rolfes and sweeps a wonderful goal into the top corner from the left side of the box. Pep Guardiola shakes the hand of his opposite number Robin Dutt in appreciation of a stunning finish. 90+1 min \"Player to improve Barcelona,\" says Niall Murphy. \"Nedved for me. Brilliant close control, tremenedous energy and will, dodgy barnet to match Messi. Play on the left of front three he would be well capable of doing a stint of hard grafting further back if needed. Loved watching him play\" Full time: Barcelona 7-1 Bayer Leverkusen What's your favourite scary movie? At the moment mine is Barcelona 7-1 Bayer Leverkusen, a terrifying 90-minute demonstration of the defence-shredding genius of Barcelona and Lionel Messi. They go through 10-2 on aggregate, and for much of the tie they were playing within themselves. I can't think of anything else to say about this amazing football team. Imagine how good they'll be when they get Mick Harford. Thanks for your emails; night.",

Leno had it covered.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> \"Watching that Messi video I was struck by two things,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"One, that Leo has EXACTLY the same grin as Christian Bale c.Harsh Times, and Two, that he's not prone to flashiness, is he? He does spectacular things in an unspectacular way; he gets things done. Would it be asking too much for a bit more Ronaldinho/Cantona etc in his play?\" I know what you mean, although football genius has always been deceptively efficient. And that goal against Arsenal last year was as imaginative as anything you'll see for many a year.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Barcelona are tiki-takaing the life out of Leverkusen, imperceptibly taking complete control of the game as they so often do between the 11th and 20th minutes.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> If you could pick one player in the history of the game to improve this Barcelona team, who would it be and why? It's tempting to pick a great keeper, but could Schmeichel/Yashin/whoever play football in the way that Valdes does? That's a pretty important requirement of a Barcelona keeper. Equally, many of history's great individual players would be too, well, individual for this side. Nilton Santos maybe?</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>19 min</strong> After a decent move involving Rolfes and Renato Augusto, Rolfes's long-range shot is blocked by Busquets.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> \"Can't open the video of Messi that you posted here in the U.S,\" says George Demas. \"There is a video on YouTube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" 9dwz0fd64uk\"\">showing Messi at the age of five</a>. Assuming it's the same one, it is amazing how focused he was even then.\" That's not quite the same one \u2013 this clip included him at the age of six, beating 74 boys and scoring \u2013&#xa0;but they are equally scary.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>23 min</strong> Iniesta hoodwinks Castro on the left and is brought down. Castro should have been booked, although it's a bit irritating to see Iniesta asking for a card for the second time tonight.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>24 min</strong> The free-kick almost produces the first goal. It's swung in by Xavi, beats everyone in the area and is palmed away by Leno, diving to his left. That's a good save because he would have had one eye on Pique, who had got away from his marker but then missed his attempted header.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 25)</strong> I was typing '<strong>GOAL!</strong>' when he was 45 yards out. It's a sublime finish from Lionel Messi. With Leverkusen having a suicidally high line, almost on the halfway line in fact, Messi curved his run to get beyond the defence onto a straightforward through pass from deep by Xavi. He ran into the area, a little left of centre, and lifted a wonderful scoop over the outstretched left arm of Leno. For most players such a scoop shot would have been a risky finish, but Messi always works within the limitations of his talent. There are no limitations.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> \"Player to improve Barcelona?\" says Simon Frank. \"Stuart Pearce.\" Imagine how his Barcelona team-mates would <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgzd7oHyeBY\">react to this</a>. They would be so appalled that they'd ask the ref for a card for their own player.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Messi scurries into the box from the right, past the static Kadlec, and his shot is blocked well by Toprak.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>32 min</strong> \"The mid-70s Bayern side played a style of fluid football that was completely underrated, and I reckon Beckenbauer could slot very nicely into the Barca central defence,\" says Andrew Mullinder. \"So, him, and Mick Harford, who would help them on the type of rainy Tuesday night at Stoke during which players like Messi and Pedro would obviously be completely useless.\" Beckenbauer is an excellent suggestion. Not even Barcelona's defenders <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKjOrH7FkpM\">can do this</a>.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Pedro, put through on goal by Xavi, is wrongly called offside. Oh well, they'll have another clear chance in a couple of minutes.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>34 min</strong> Xavi blooters the ball over the bar from 25 yards. It took a slight deflection but the referee gave a goal kick.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> \"To answer your question, and not to bang on about him, but Ronaldinho (when he still tried) for Pedro, Zidane for Fabregas, I imagine John Charles would do a good job at the back. I think Cafu was better than Alves, and Best in for, errr, someone,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"I have ignored Maradona and Pele because that's an even less interesting than the ones I have made. It's called Lovejoy's Theorum. If you can only think of Maradona or Pele as a subjective footballing answer, you either are ... you know where I'm going.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> Is there anybody out there who seriously believes Pep Guardiola would even <em>consider</em> swapping all this for a load of egomaniacal, football-illiterate hasbeens?</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> Barcelona are coasting. It's terrifying effortless. Leverkusen are struggling to keep pace with the shadows, never mind the actual Barcelona players. I don't think they've touched the ball for three or four minutes.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> \"As Cesc has managed to push his way in, I'd say a peak Platini would have made an improvement to the team (or at least not weakened),\" says Ben Dunn. \"Platini did everything Cesc can but with a Gallic panache hazed in filterless tobacco smoke as if he were the protagonist in a sexually charged incomprehensible black-and-white film.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 42)</strong> For most players this would have been a sublime goal; for Messi it is utterly routine. We've seen him score this type of goal so many times before. He was found by a perceptive angled pass by Iniesta, just outside the area to the right of centre. He ran into the box and then across the area in a straight line, the ball never more than a few millimetres from his left foot. After dummying to shoot a couple of times, he placed the ball into the far corner. He made a difficult chance look offensively easy.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>43 min</strong> Leno comes out bravely to smother Fabregas's stabbed shot. Moments later, Castro is booked for another hapless attempt to tackle Iniesta.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Half time: Barcelona 2-0 Bayer Leverkusen</strong> See you in 10 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Half time email</strong> </p> <p>\"Don't you think that some of the Laws of football limit the influence of skill in the game? For example, minimal substitutions and the lack of in-and-out privileges (temporary substitutions) make for tired and exhausted players, who don't play as well, are more likely to tackle poorly instead of defend well, and are more likely to get injured (taking their skills out of future games). And the older players (presumably smarter and more skilled) can't play as long. The no timeouts rule prevents managers from advising as needed. Penalties that are too easy to score in comparison to the denied 'goalscoring opportunity' can kill off an entire 90 minutes of hard work. And making a team play one man down for a severe foul, rather than simply punishing the individual, again can kill those 90 minutes. Then again, none of this seems to inhibit Barcelona. Maybe I'm just watching the wrong league.\" </p> <p>I'd maybe argue the opposite, that perhaps the rule changes have gone too far in favour of the attackers, and that as a result <em>nobody in the world apart from Nemanja Vidic can bloody defend properly</em>. I don't know, I'd have to think it through. I'd like to read a big essay on why defending has gone to seed, though.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Oh, Stevie</strong> \"To improve the Barcelona team how about swop Messi himself for Joe Cole,\" says Mike Gibbons, \"who is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/10/joe-cole-messi-gerrard-liverpool\">as good if not better</a>, or certainly was until recently?\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>More half-time thoughts</strong> \"I have to defend Pedro the Canarian,\" says Ceci Marjakangas. \"I agree, he's not as magical to watch as Leo, or Cesc, or even Tello, but he's a hard worker. He's been but a shadow of himself for ages, though. Was Alexis not injured again, he'd be playing and not Pedro. The Bar\u00e7a docs are looking into what's ailing him because such a tough Chilean street player should not be off to the sick bay so often. They think it might have to do with his diet. Anyhow, with Villa injured as well, that only leaves Pep with Pedrito, or then the inexperienced youngsters Cuenca and Tello. But I agree, Pedro's not a favourite of mine, and he sounds like a chihuahua. I still think most teams in the Premier League would be very happy to sign him up.\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV2gzheZZE4\">Tello looks extremely exciting</a>, doesn't he.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Barcelona kick off the second half. They lead 5-1 on aggregate. Can they hold on and make it through to the quarter finals?</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> \"Richard Dunne would improve Barcelona - his wholehearted oafishness would humanize the team, and make it more relatable to mere mortals,\" says Hugh Collins. \"Their current level of superiority is at times a little hard to stomach. Just ask Jose Mourinho.\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> Fabregas tries one pass too many. Iniesta, Fabregas and Messi shredded the defence in a blur of short first-time passes, with Messi's return ball putting Fabregas through on Leno. He could have shot but tried to square it to Iniesta, who had started the move on the touchline approximately 0.2 seconds earlier, and Schwaab cleared for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 3-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 50)</strong> I'm sorry, but this is just ridiculous. It's not remotely fair. Barcelona should be handicapped, made to play with nine men, when Lionel Messi is in their side. He Messi has scored his eighth hat-trick of the season \u2013 <em>his eighth hat-trick of the season</em> \u2013 and this might be the best goal of the three. Again he ran beyond the defence onto a through pass, this time from Busquets. His first touch on the edge of the area was exquisite, but the covering Schwaab seemed to have forced him a little wide. Then Messi produced a glorious chip with his weaker right foot that arced over the head of Leno and plopped gently into the far corner. The extent and the efficiency of his genius is totally beyond our comprehension.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>53 min</strong> No more Xaviesta porn tonight. Andres Iniesta, who played marvellously on the left of the front three, is replaced by the highly promising Tello, and Seydou Keita comes on for Xavi.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> Bayer Leverkusen almost reduce the aggregate deficit to 6-2. Derdiyok runs into the area down the left, bounces off Mascherano and then, from an absurd angle, dinks the ball over Valdes and right across the goalline.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>55 min</strong> Leverkusen also make a double substitution: Derdiyok and Bender and replaced by Karim Bellarabi and Andre Schurrle.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 4-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Tello 55)</strong> The 20-year-old Cristian Tello came on two minutes ago for his European debut; he's already scored. He ran down the left onto a delightful lobbed pass from Fabregas, headed the ball into the area and then, with his second touch, opened up his body to pass the ball calmly across Leno into the far corner. A lovely finish from a player who looks a serious prospect.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 5-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 58)</strong> Messi has four. After some more rat-a-tat passing on the edge of the area, Pedro tries to slip the ball through to Messi. He's blocked off by two defenders and Leno comes to claim, but he's at full stretch and the ball slithers from his grasp. Messi, who kept running, passes the ball in from a very tight angle on the left of the six-yard box.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> I am less speech.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>60 min</strong> \"Messi is Maradona meets Gerd Muller,\" says Mike Gibbons. \"200 in five seasons...sorry, 201 now.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 6-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Tello 62)</strong> Poor Leno hoofs the post in disgust, because Barcelona have scored again. They break four on three, and Alves lifts a pass to Tello in space on the left side of the box. He takes a touch and passes it through the left hand of the sprawling Leno. He should probably have done better, but you can't really blame him for making mistakes in the face of this bombardment.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>63 min</strong> Barcelona make their final substitution, with the young defender Marc Muniesa replacing Adriano.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>64 min</strong> \"Football referees, like their counterparts in boxing, should be empowered to end contests early,\" says Ben Stanley. \"This is painful.\"</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Do you see what happens, Larry? Do you see what happens when you play a high line against Barcelona?</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Leverkusen make their final change, with Bastian Oczipka replacing Renato Augusto.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> \"How crazy is it,\" says Karl Thomas Meakin, \"that this Bar\u00e7a side almost certainly aren't going to win the league?\" It's Jose Mourinho's greatest achievement, followed by centuries of daylight, followed by that treble with Inter and the titles with Chelsea. It's mind-blowing to think that Mourinho won the title by February against perhaps the greatest team of all time.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong> This is a case for the League Against Cruel Sports. Leverkusen haven't had a kick all night.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> \"I'd suggest Michael Laudrup (genuinely) and Preben Elkjaer (to get this mail published) would both improve this Barcelona side,\" says David Bartlett. Laudrup would be great on the left of the front three, with Iniesta back into midfield.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>76 min</strong> Nothing much is happening. Barcelona seem to have declared at six. Leverkusen have certainly declared at minus six.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> \"I was going to write and agree with you about the decline of defending but then I remembered how much fun this season has been as well as some half-repressed flashes of the 2003 Champions League final and now I realize that we must track down Nemanja Vidic and purge the last remnants of that terrible curse from the earth,\" says Alex Hanton.. \"I assume Johan Cruyff has already done most of the legwork, possibly by battling a cyborg Helenio Herrera in the center of a rain-soaked Camp Nou, but he's getting on now and we all have to help out.\" What are you on about? That 2003 final was <em>cerebral</em>.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> \"I disagree...Bar\u00e7a have played Madrid five times this season and Madrid never beat them,\" says Finola Leggett. \"The fact that they are 10 points behind has more to do with Bar\u00e7a's mental fatigue and Spanish football politics than Mourinho's genius.\" Surely the fact even Mourinho's can't beat Barcelona makes his achievement in the league even greater, as it means he's had to secure an extra six points. Their margin for error is almost nonexistent.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> Almost a seventh goal. Pedro breaks the offside trap on the right of the box, and his low cross just evades the stretching Keita in front of an open goal.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>81 min</strong> Fabregas's outswinging corner is headed wide by Keita, ten yards from goal at the near post. Mick Harford would have buried it.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 7-0 Bayer Leverkusen (Messi 85)</strong> Lionel Messi becomes the first man to score five goals in a Champions League match. It was another terrifyingly simple goal, passed into the corner at pace from the D. There's nothing left to say.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> \"In fairness Mourinho hasn't really managed to beat this Barca team,\" says Alex Hanton. \"He's just found a way of winning anyway. He's like the Roman general who worked out he couldn't beat Hannibal so just decided to burn everything within a 50-mile radius instead.\" He's still beaten them twice in big games, which is more than anyone else has managed. But his main achievement is to win <em>almost every single other bloody match</em>. People dismiss this on the grounds La Liga isn't great, but I don't see anyone else winning 22 games out of 25. He has raised the bar to a level that even Barcelona can't reach.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Lionel Messi is 24 years old.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> \"In an age when sports stars are more and more physically impressive, am I right in thinking that Messi is about average height, average weight and average build?\" says Gary Naylor. \"In a police report, he'd have no distinguishing features, would he?\"</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> That should have been a hat-trick on his debut, as a substitute, for Tello. Leverkusen won their first corner \u2013 which inevitably meant a chance for Barcelona about five seconds later. Fabregas broke and played a gentle through ball to Tello, whose shot was superbly saved by poor Leno.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 7-1 Bayer Leverkusen (Bellarabi 90)</strong> This could be the very definition of the consolation goal. The substitute Karim Bellarabi plays a neat one-two with Rolfes and sweeps a wonderful goal into the top corner from the left side of the box. Pep Guardiola shakes the hand of his opposite number Robin Dutt in appreciation of a stunning finish.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>90+1 min</strong> \"Player to improve Barcelona,\" says Niall Murphy. \"Nedved for me. Brilliant close control, tremenedous energy and will, dodgy barnet to match Messi. Play on the left of front three he would be well capable of doing a stint of hard grafting further back if needed. Loved watching him play\"</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>Full time: Barcelona 7-1 Bayer Leverkusen</strong> What's your favourite scary movie? At the moment mine is Barcelona 7-1 Bayer Leverkusen, a terrifying 90-minute demonstration of the defence-shredding genius of Barcelona and Lionel Messi. They go through 10-2 on aggregate, and for much of the tie they were playing within themselves. I can't think of anything else to say about this amazing football team. Imagine how good they'll be when they get Mick Harford. Thanks for your emails; night.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Good evening everybody. The exit of Crawley Town at the hands of Stoke City a couple of Sundays ago means that League One side Stevenage, who have yet to concede a goal in the FA Cup this season, are the lowliest team left in the tournament. Tonight is Stevenage's second ever match against Spurs, the first having been the tireless and professional (translation: admirably dogged but painful on the eye) performance at the Lamex Stadium that earned them tonight's lucrative replay at White Hart Lane. The winners of tonight's match, which could go to extra time and penalties, will entertain Bolton Wanderers on St Patrick's Day (17th March) in the last eight of the competition - a prospect that is unlikely to have players or fans of Stevenage or Spurs quaking in their boots considering the Lancashire club's current Premier League travails. Team news: Always a man of his word, Harry Redknapp has named a strong team, as promised. Rafael van der Vaart, Gareth Bale and Scott Parker are all back after missing Sunday's defeat to Manchester United, while Jermain Defoe and Michael Dawson also start. Having signed for Tottenham as a youngster 20 years ago, goalkeeper Chris Day finally makes his first competitive appearance at White Hart Lane, albeit for the visitors. Tottenham: Cudicini, Nelsen, Dawson, Kaboul, Rose, Lennon, Parker, Kranjcar, Bale, Van der Vaart, Defoe. Subs: Friedel, Adebayor, Gallas, Modric, Giovani, Walker, Livermore. Stevenage: Day, Henry, Ashton, Roberts, Laird, Wilson, Byrom, Bostwick, Charles, Beardsley, Shroot. Subs: Julian, Edwards, Long, Reid, Myrie-Williams, May, Winn. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) For anyone who doesn't know: Tottenham are third in the Premier League, while Stevenage are 49 places and two divisions below them in League One. Neither side is enjoying a particularly good run of form at the moment, with Tottenham having lost twice, heavily, on the spin while their visitors have failed to win any of their last five. 1 min: Stevenage kick off playing from left to right, their players kitted out in azure fusion four shirts, shorts and socks. Tottenham wear their usual home kit of white shirts, navy shorts and white socks. 2 min: Penalty for Stevenage! Ryan Nelsen takes down Joel Byrom and referee Michael Oliver blows his whistle and points to the spot. Good shout. GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Stevenage (Byrom 3pen) No signs of nerves as Joel Byrom waits for Carlo Cudicini to move left, fires to the goalkeeper's right and wheels away in celebration. That's a wonderful start for Stevenage. 6 min: There's a lull in play as Michael Dawson goes down in a crumpled heap after leaping for a high ball - it looks like he might have shipped a bad knock to his knee. The ESPN cameras cut to Ryan Nelsen, who is moaning to the referee about the award of the penalty. Replays show the Spurs defender to be in the wrong - it was, as they say, stonewall. 8 min: Spare a thought for Michael Dawson, whose horrific run of bad luck with injury continues. He gets stretchered off to be replaced by Kyle Walker. For those who may not know, Michael Dawson is from Wensleydale but doesn't like Wensleydale cheese. I know this, because I asked him. 10 min: Since Michael Dawson went off, Scott Parker has taken over the captaincy, so expect endless amounts of handwringing from assorted journalists over whether or not he's the right man for the job. Perhaps Harry should have handed the armband to Aaron Lennon or Carlo Cudicini ... or flown it up to Liverpool and wrapped it around the biceps of Steven Gerrard. 13 min: The early goal and injury to Dawson seem to have sucked all the life out of the occasion, leaving the atmosphere in White Hart Lane decidedly eerie. That'll suit Stevenage and their 4,000 travelling fans just fine. 15 min: And a very good evening to those of you tuning in late because you incorrectly presumed this match was kicking off at 7.45pm. You haven't missed much, don't worry. 16 min: The camera cuts to the Tottenham dugout, where Emmanuel Adebayor and William Gallas are having a great chat and a giggle, paying no attention whatsoever to the game unfolding before them. 17 min: Scott Parker and Mark Roberts collide, go down in a heap and eventually pick themselves from the ground, rubbing their heads gingerly. This has been very, very scrappy so far, with just one shot on goal that I can recall: Stevenage's penalty. 18 min: Cutting in from the inside right for Stevenage, Michael Bostwick tries a diagonal shot from distance. Well, I say shot ... it might have been a cross or through-ball. It's difficult to tell as it went nowhere near the goal and skidded about 10 yards wide. 8.50pm: \"VdV and Bale aren't fit for United, but start against mighty Stevenage just a few days later?!\" splutters Adam Boscerino. \"And now Dawson does his knee again in a match that means just about nothing. Redknapp sounds like the perfect fit for England.\" I'm not sure I understand your logic, Adam. Are you saying that, because Van Der Vaart and Bale were unfit to play against Manchester United they should never play again? And are you also suggesting that a manager in the habit of picking his best players for knockout cup football is unsuitable to manage a team who will never triumph in a tournament without successfully winning several consecutive games of knockout Cup football? 23 min: Ronnie Henry concedes a corner, which Rafael van der Vaart takes for Spurs. Nothing comes of it. The atmosphere at White Hart Lane remains very, very subdued. 24 min: \"My brother is a Spurs fan, his wife: Stevenage,\" writes Marek Miernik. \"As much as I would be supporting the underdog in a game like this, I couldn't wish the lifetime of humiliation on top of the lifetime of being wrong about everything.\" GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Stevenage (Defoe 25) From the left-back position, Ryan Nelsen picks out Jermain Defoe with a long ball. He controls it on the edge of the penalty area and then unleashes a long-distance drive that fizzes past Chris Day in the Stevenage goal and into the bottom left-hand corner. It's all square. 27 min: Moments before that Tottenham equaliser, a Niko Kranjcar foul had given Stevenage a free-kick wide on the right. Joel Byrom swung the ball into the far post, where Jon Ashton had ghosted in unmarked only to head a glorious chance wide. 29 min: Replays of that Stevenage chance I told you about a couple of minutes ago show that Stevenage could easily have had a second penalty - Scott Parker tried to wrestle Michael Bostwick to the ground as Joel Byrom's free-kick was sent in the penalty area. Sunderland got a penalty for less obvious pulling-and-dragging on Michael Turner against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon. 33 min: \"The logic,\" writes Adam Boscarino. \"Is that no one should be able to heal from injuries that keep them out of a big match in a few days time. If they're fit today, they were fit on Saturday. And the reserves should be able to beat Stevenage. No need to risk your top squad in a match like this when the season is going down in flames and you're spiraling out of the Champions League picture.\" Nope, still makes no sense. It's quite feasible that Gareth Bale was ill on Sunday, but isn't tonight. But it's good to see such hopeless romanticism from the modern day football fan, advocating the removal of what little prestige the FA Cup has left to save a season that's going \"down in flames\" because your incredibly rich team might not finish third in the Premier League table. Oh, the horror - I'm sure fans of Rangers, Portsmouth and Port Vale can all identify with your terrible pain at this very difficult time for Spurs. 37 min: Aaron Lennon has gone down injured and it looks like his evening is over. 38 min: Tottenham substitution: Aaron Lennon hobbles off with an injury to his left leg, Emmanuel Adebayor replaces him. 40 min: Gareth Bale gallops down the inside left channel for Tottenham, before unleashing a shot with the leg he normally reserves for standing on. Some time later, Stevenage goalkeeper Chris Day retrieves the ball from a punter in the stand behind his goal. 42 min: Despite this being Best Team Left In The FA Cup v Worst Team Left In The FA Cup, and despite plucky little Stevenage going ahead and despite Jermain Defoe's crisp equaliser from distance, this match has failed to ignite. The players seem sluggish, the crowd seems half-asleep and nobody seems too bothered which way the result goes. This isn't the first time this season I've got the feeling the FA Cup may be in its death throes ... which is a shame, because it used to be a great competition that was well worth winning. 45 min: Stevenage go forward, but without any real sense of urgency. Michael Bostwick eventually ups the pace and cuts inside Ryan Nelsen, but once again can't decide whether to cross or shoot. His 'effort' manages to elude both the goal and the incoming Scott Laird. 46 min: Good play from Rafael van der Vaart, who tries to pick out Emmanuel Adebayor on the edge of the Stevenage six-yard box. Mark Roberts dispossesses the big Togolese with a good tackle, conceding a corner in the process. When the ball's whipped in from the quadrant and hits a Stevenage defender, Spurs fans behind the goal appeal for a penalty for handball, but none is forthcoming. Half-time: Spurs go in with the scores level, having lost Aaron Lennon and Michael Dawson to injury. I'll be surprised if Gareth Bale comes out for the second half, because he too appears to have picked up a knock. Adam Boscarino won't be best pleased. Shane Caffrey is here with something to pass half-time: Specifically, it's his Republic of Ireland v Czech Republic timelapse video, recorded at the Aviva Stadium last week. I've only seen a bit of it, so apologies if (a) it's rubbish or (b) he's slipped something unsavoury or pornographic in towards the second half. At the ESPN pitchside pundit bar: \"Wow, great FA Cup tie!\" exhorts Ray Stubbs, fooling nobody. Nice try Stubbsy, but you're obviously just toeing the party line this emphatically is not a great Cup tie. Admittedly, I've been up and working since 8am, but it can't just be a case of me being tired, grumpy and cynical here; does anyone out there watching think this match is any good? Adam Boscarino is back, with more Premier League-centric ramblings: \"Glendenning, the only people who are enjoying this match are Arsenal and Chelsea supporters,\" he says, and he's probably not wrong. \"Not sure Adam Boscarino knows much about Spurs, but this is more or less a reserve team,\" harrumphs Simon Rush. \"His attitude is what makes people (me included) really dislike some Spurs fans. And I'm a Spurs fan. And I would love us to win the FA Cup.\" Second half: Michael Bostock gets booked for a foul on Jermain Defoe, while I fix the link on that timelapse video, which apparently I messed up earlier. If it isn't working now, that's Shane Caffrey's fault, not mine. 48 min: Younes Kaboul squares the ball, sending it low and hard across the edge of the Stevenage six-yard box. With his back to goal, Jermain Defoe sweeps the ball past goalkeeper Chris Day with the heel of his right foot, only for his fine effort to be ruled out because he was standing several feet offside. Meanwhile in Docklands, a Tottenham fan of my acquaintance drains another bottle of hard liquor and weeps salty tears for what might have been. 50 min: Stevenage almost go ahead again; in fact they should have. After a bit of pinball in the Tottenham penalty area, the ball breaks kindly for Mark Roberts, who shoots straight at Carlo Cudicini from about five yards when he had plenty of goal to aim at and only the goalkeeper to beat. 54 min: Penalty for Tottenham. 53 min: Mark Roberts brings down Gareth Bale with a fairly innocuous looking challenge on the right-hand side of the penalty area and after a brief consultation with his linesman, Michael Oliver points to the spot ... then reaches for his pocket and books the defender. GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Stevenage (Adebayor 54pen) Adebayor waits for the whistle, runs up and pauses briefly. In the Stevenage goal, Chris Day dives left, allowing Adebayor to coolly slot the ball home to his right. 57 min: It's not all good news for Spurs fans, though. The word on the touchline is that Michael Dawson has been brought to hospital with what are thought to be ruptured ankle ligaments. The poor sod has had no luck recently, which is a shame because you couldn't hope to meet a nicer bloke. 58 min: Gareth Bale rattles the Stevenage crossbar with a long-range dipping effort from the inside left position that had left the goalkeeper gazing forlornly backwards over his head after a token late jump. 61 min: Niko Kranjcar goes close for Spurs, but no cigar for him. 63 min: Stevenage substitutions: Jennison Myrie-Williams and Craig Reid on, Chris Beardsley and Darius Charles off. 63 min: Michael Bostwick, who's been one of Stevenage's betterp layers tonight, stings Carlo Cudicini's palms with a long-range effort. From the ensuing corner, Stevenage win another one. The ball's whipped in and ... 64 min: ... somebody in a Stevenage shirt heads it against the bar, it bounces down, out and eventually finds sanctuary in the arms of Cudincini after a brief goalmouth scramble. 65 min: Assorted Stevenage players claimed that ball bounced off the crossbar and over the goal-line and I have to say that upon seeing it once in real time, I hadn't a clue whether or not it did. Replays show that it bounced four or five inches in front of the line, so the match officials were correct not to award the goal. Fair dues ... 68 min: Some people have mailed in to say I was too hard on first half correspondent Adam Boscarino. They're probably right, but that certainly wasn't my intention. While I couldn't diasgree with Scott more, he's perfectly entitled to his opinion over which tournament should be Tottenham's priority, an opinion he aired politely and without getting abusive ... even if he is talking through his fez. 70 min: Jermain Defoe gets on the end of an Emmanuel Adebayor cross from the left, but heads straight at Chris Day from six yards. Had he scored it wouldn't have counted, because the linesman had raised his flag. 73 min: This second half''s been much better than the first, as you've probably guessed. I was trying to issue that 'apology' to Adam Boscarino for nearly half an hour, but kept getting interrupted by stuff happening on the field of play. I thought Stevenage's resistence would crumble once Tottenham went 2-1 up, but hats off to them, they're fighting dogged ... oh, hang on. GOAL! Tottenham 3-1 Stevenage (Defoe 74) I spoke too soon. Stevenage's players fall asleep at a throw-in, Gareth Bale pings a through ball down the inside left to Jermaine Defoe, who cuts inside two defenders and shoots diagonally across the face of goal and into the bottom right-hand corner. 77 min: Moments after the kick-off, Stevenage's man of the match thus far, Michael Bostwick, sends a long-range effort fizzing this wide of the left upright. Great effort. 79 min: Emmanuel Adbayor tries to do a goal, but doesn't do a goal. Hard luck on not doing a goal, Emmanuel Adebayor. Better luck next time you try to do a goal. 80 min: Incidentally, for those asking ... I have no idea why Emmanuel Adebayor has what appears to be duct tape on his ears. Perhaps he lost a bet? If anyone does know, please share your information with the rest of the class. 80 min: Tottenham substitution: Jake Livermore on, Niko Kranjcar off. \"Is it just me or does the new ipad look a bit tame? Have Apple run out of ideas?\" asks Steven Panides, before adding: \"Hang on, what thread is this? Let me revise. Is it just me or do Tottenham look a bit tame? Has Harry run out of ideas? 83 min: \"Surely the point Adam was making was that Harry was prepared to sacrifice the Europa League, judging top four to be more important but that now, when they're having a wobble, plays his strongest team (losing two of them) when Spurs need everyone fit and firing to finish the season strongly?\" writes Tom Barneby, who sounds like a middle-aged busybody policeman in middle England. \"Spurs are more than capable of messing CL qualification up from here and a top four squad should be able to defeat a League One side at home without risking the fitness of someone who must have had no chance at all three days ago?\" 84 min: \"I believe Adebayor has to wear the tape over his ears because of earrings (very, very dangerous),\" writes Cameron Clark. \"I guess he finds this preferable to ... y'know, just taking them out.\" But isn't the wearing of earrings forbidden, even if they are covered by duct-tape? And while we're at it, what are those things that Ricardo Fuller wears that look like earrings but aren't? 86 min: \"Is Michael Dawson the nicest bloke in football?\" asks Alex Porritt. \"Not a hotly contested title I realise, but who are the other contenders?\" I don't know off the top of my head, but I'd be interested to see who'd win a fight between Michael Dawson, arguably the nicest man in football, and Dave Grohl, arguably the nicest man in rock 'n' roll. The only problem with that might be the length of time we'd have to wait for one of them to throw the first punch. 88 min: Hats off to Stevenage, they're nothing if not persistent buggers. Craig Reid goes close with the same kind of sweeping backheel Jermain tried earlier, but Carlo Cudicini is alert enough to stop his fine effort when it looked like going past him. 89 min: Going back to that penalty incident, which led to Tottenham's second. As Bale galloped through the Stevenage penalty area and steadied himself to cross, Michael Roberts slid in alongside him to block the delivery. It wasn't a particularly clever tackle, but it certainly wasn't a foul - Bale kicked the soul of Roberts' boot with his follow-through, the momentum of both players took them out over the byline and when they looked up, the referee was pointing at the spot. There was no foul, no attempt to gull the referee by Bale ... just a wrong decision. Peep! Peep! Peep! It's all over and class has prevailed in the end. Spurs see off Stevenage to earn themselves a quarter-final tie against Bolton at White Hart Lane a week on Saturday. The result aside, it's been a bad evening for Harry Redknapp's team - they've lost both Aaron Lennon and Michael Dawson to injury and reports on ESPN suggest that as well as rupturing his ankle ligaments, the unfortunate centre-half and captain has also knacked his knee. While I wish him a very speedy and full recovery, I can't help but feel that perhaps if he supported his local cheese industry and ate Wensleydale, he wouldn't be so brittle.",

      "body": "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Good evening everybody.</strong> The exit of Crawley Town at the hands of Stoke City a couple of Sundays ago means that League One side Stevenage, who have yet to concede a goal in the FA Cup this season, are the lowliest team left in the tournament. </p> <p>Tonight is Stevenage's second ever match against Spurs, the first having been the tireless and professional (translation: admirably dogged but painful on the eye) performance at the Lamex Stadium that earned them tonight's lucrative replay at White Hart Lane. </p> <p>The winners of tonight's match, which could go to extra time and penalties, will entertain Bolton Wanderers on St Patrick's Day (17th March) in the last eight of the competition - a prospect that is unlikely to have players or fans of Stevenage or Spurs quaking in their boots considering the Lancashire club's current Premier League travails.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> Always a man of his word, Harry Redknapp has named a strong team, as promised. Rafael van der Vaart, Gareth Bale and Scott Parker are all back after missing Sunday's defeat to Manchester United, while Jermain Defoe and Michael Dawson also start. Having signed for Tottenham as a youngster 20 years ago, goalkeeper Chris Day finally makes his first competitive appearance at White Hart Lane, albeit for the visitors.</p> <p><strong>Tottenham:</strong> Cudicini, Nelsen, Dawson, Kaboul, Rose, Lennon, Parker, Kranjcar, Bale, Van der Vaart, Defoe. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Friedel, Adebayor, Gallas, Modric, Giovani, Walker, Livermore.</p> <p><strong>Stevenage:</strong> Day, Henry, Ashton, Roberts, Laird, Wilson, Byrom, Bostwick, Charles, Beardsley, Shroot. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Julian, Edwards, Long, Reid, Myrie-Williams, May, Winn.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Michael Oliver (Northumberland)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>For anyone who doesn't know:</strong> Tottenham are third in the Premier League, while Stevenage are 49 places and two divisions below them in League One. Neither side is enjoying a particularly good run of form at the moment, with Tottenham having lost twice, heavily, on the spin while their visitors have failed to win any of their last five.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Stevenage kick off playing from left to right, their players kitted out in <a href=\"http://www.dulux.co.uk/colour/azure_fusion_4\">azure fusion four</a> shirts, shorts and socks. Tottenham wear their usual home kit of white shirts, navy shorts and white socks.</p> <!-- Block 5 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387059908\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273743360147/MBM-penalty-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM penalty\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Penalty for Stevenage!

Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Stevenage (Byrom 3pen)</strong> No signs of nerves as Joel Byrom waits for Carlo Cudicini to move left, fires to the goalkeeper's right and wheels away in celebration. That's a wonderful start for Stevenage.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> There's a lull in play as Michael Dawson goes down in a crumpled heap after leaping for a high ball - it looks like he might have shipped a bad knock to his knee. The ESPN cameras cut to Ryan Nelsen, who is moaning to the referee about the award of the penalty. Replays show the Spurs defender to be in the wrong - it was, as they say, stonewall.</p> <!-- Block 8 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387059910\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273743391802/MBM-substitution-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Spare a thought for Michael Dawson, whose horrific run of bad luck with injury continues. He gets stretchered off to be replaced by Kyle Walker. For those who may not know, Michael Dawson is from Wensleydale but doesn't like Wensleydale cheese. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jan/13/small-talk-tottenham-hotspur-michael-dawson\">I know this, because I asked him</a>.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Since Michael Dawson went off, Scott Parker has taken over the captaincy, so expect endless amounts of handwringing from assorted journalists over whether or not he's the right man for the job. Perhaps Harry should have handed the armband to Aaron Lennon or Carlo Cudicini ... or flown it up to Liverpool and wrapped it around the biceps of Steven Gerrard.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> The early goal and injury to Dawson seem to have sucked all the life out of the occasion, leaving the atmosphere in White Hart Lane decidedly eerie. That'll suit Stevenage and their 4,000 travelling fans just fine.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> And a very good evening to those of you tuning in late because you incorrectly presumed this match was kicking off at 7.45pm. You haven't missed much, don't worry.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> The camera cuts to the Tottenham dugout, where Emmanuel Adebayor and William Gallas are having a great chat and a giggle, paying no attention whatsoever to the game unfolding before them.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Scott Parker and Mark Roberts collide, go down in a heap and eventually pick themselves from the ground, rubbing their heads gingerly. This has been very, very scrappy so far, with just one shot on goal that I can recall: Stevenage's penalty.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Cutting in from the inside right for Stevenage, Michael Bostwick tries a diagonal shot from distance. Well, I say shot ... it might have been a cross or through-ball. It's difficult to tell as it went nowhere near the goal and skidded about 10 yards wide.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>8.50pm:</strong> \"VdV and Bale aren't fit for United, but start against mighty Stevenage just a few days later?!\" splutters Adam Boscerino. \"And now Dawson does his knee again in a match that means just about nothing. Redknapp sounds like the perfect fit for England.\" </p> <p>I'm not sure I understand your logic, Adam. Are you saying that, because Van Der Vaart and Bale were unfit to play against Manchester United they should never play again? And are you also suggesting that a manager in the habit of picking his best players for knockout cup football is unsuitable to manage a team who will never triumph in a tournament without successfully winning several consecutive games of knockout Cup football?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Ronnie Henry concedes a corner, which Rafael van der Vaart takes for Spurs. Nothing comes of it. The atmosphere at White Hart Lane remains very, very subdued.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> \"My brother is a Spurs fan, his wife: Stevenage,\" writes Marek Miernik. \"As much as I would be supporting the underdog in a game like this, I couldn't wish the lifetime of humiliation on top of the lifetime of being wrong about everything.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387059911\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273742993249/MBM-goal-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM goal\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Stevenage (Defoe 25)</strong> From the left-back position, Ryan Nelsen picks out Jermain Defoe with a long ball. He controls it on the edge of the penalty area and then unleashes a long-distance drive that fizzes past Chris Day in the Stevenage goal and into the bottom left-hand corner. It's all square.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Moments before that Tottenham equaliser, a Niko Kranjcar foul had given Stevenage a free-kick wide on the right. Joel Byrom swung the ball into the far post, where Jon Ashton had ghosted in unmarked only to head a glorious chance wide.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Replays of that Stevenage chance I told you about a couple of minutes ago show that Stevenage could easily have had a second penalty - Scott Parker tried to wrestle Michael Bostwick to the ground as Joel Byrom's free-kick was sent in the penalty area. Sunderland got a penalty for less obvious pulling-and-dragging on Michael Turner against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> \"The logic,\" writes Adam Boscarino. \"Is that no one should be able to heal from injuries that keep them out of a big match in a few days time.

The ball's whipped in and ...</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> ... somebody in a Stevenage shirt heads it against the bar, it bounces down, out and eventually finds sanctuary in the arms of Cudincini after a brief goalmouth scramble.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Assorted Stevenage players claimed that ball bounced off the crossbar and over the goal-line and I have to say that upon seeing it once in real time, I hadn't a clue whether or not it did. Replays show that it bounced four or five inches in <em>front</em> of the line, so the match officials were correct not to award the goal. Fair dues ...</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Some people have mailed in to say I was too hard on first half correspondent Adam Boscarino. They're probably right, but that certainly wasn't my intention. While I couldn't diasgree with Scott more, he's perfectly entitled to his opinion over which tournament should be Tottenham's priority, an opinion he aired politely and without getting abusive ... even if he is talking through his fez.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Jermain Defoe gets on the end of an Emmanuel Adebayor cross from the left, but heads straight at Chris Day from six yards. Had he scored it wouldn't have counted, because the linesman had raised his flag.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> This second half''s been much better than the first, as you've probably guessed. I was trying to issue that 'apology' to Adam Boscarino for nearly half an hour, but kept getting interrupted by stuff happening on the field of play. I thought Stevenage's resistence would crumble once Tottenham went 2-1 up, but hats off to them, they're fighting dogged ... oh, hang on.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Tottenham 3-1 Stevenage (Defoe 74)</strong> I spoke too soon. Stevenage's players fall asleep at a throw-in, Gareth Bale pings a through ball down the inside left to Jermaine Defoe, who cuts inside two defenders and shoots diagonally across the face of goal and into the bottom right-hand corner.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Moments after the kick-off, Stevenage's man of the match thus far, Michael Bostwick, sends a long-range effort fizzing <em>this</em> wide of the left upright. Great effort.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Emmanuel Adbayor tries to do a goal, but doesn't do a goal. Hard luck on not doing a goal, Emmanuel Adebayor. Better luck next time you try to do a goal.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Incidentally, for those asking ... I have no idea why Emmanuel Adebayor has what appears to be duct tape on his ears. Perhaps he lost a bet? If anyone does know, please share your information with the rest of the class.</p> <!-- Block 52 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387059915\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/5/13/1273743391802/MBM-substitution-001.jpg\" alt=\"MBM substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Tottenham substitution: Jake Livermore on, Niko Kranjcar off. \"Is it just me or does the new ipad look a bit tame? Have Apple run out of ideas?\" asks Steven Panides, before adding: \"Hang on, what thread is this? Let me revise. Is it just me or do Tottenham look a bit tame? Has Harry run out of ideas?</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> \"Surely the point Adam was making was that Harry was prepared to sacrifice the Europa League, judging top four to be more important but that now, when they're having a wobble, plays his strongest team (losing two of them) when Spurs need everyone fit and firing to finish the season strongly?\" writes Tom Barneby, who sounds like a middle-aged busybody policeman in middle England. \"Spurs are more than capable of messing CL qualification up from here and a top four squad should be able to defeat a League One side at home without risking the fitness of someone who must have had no chance at all three days ago?\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> \"I believe Adebayor has to wear the tape over his ears because of earrings (very, very dangerous),\" writes Cameron Clark. \"I guess he finds this preferable to ... y'know, just taking them out.\" </p> <p>But isn't the wearing of earrings forbidden, even if they are covered by duct-tape? And while we're at it, what are those things that Ricardo Fuller wears that look like earrings but aren't?</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> \"Is Michael Dawson the nicest bloke in football?\" asks Alex Porritt. \"Not a hotly contested title I realise, but who are the other contenders?\" I don't know off the top of my head, but I'd be interested to see who'd win a fight between Michael Dawson, arguably the nicest man in football, and Dave Grohl, arguably the nicest man in rock 'n' roll. The only problem with that might be the length of time we'd have to wait for one of them to throw the first punch.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Hats off to Stevenage, they're nothing if not persistent buggers. Craig Reid goes close with the same kind of sweeping backheel Jermain tried earlier, but Carlo Cudicini is alert enough to stop his fine effort when it looked like going past him.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Going back to that penalty incident, which led to Tottenham's second. As Bale galloped through the Stevenage penalty area and steadied himself to cross, Michael Roberts slid in alongside him to block the delivery. It wasn't a particularly clever tackle, but it certainly wasn't a foul - Bale kicked the soul of Roberts' boot with his follow-through, the momentum of both players took them out over the byline and when they looked up, the referee was pointing at the spot. There was no foul, no attempt to gull the referee by Bale ... just a wrong decision.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peep!</strong> It's all over and class has prevailed in the end. Spurs see off Stevenage to earn themselves a quarter-final tie against Bolton at White Hart Lane a week on Saturday. The result aside, it's been a bad evening for Harry Redknapp's team - they've lost both Aaron Lennon and Michael Dawson to injury and reports on ESPN suggest that as well as rupturing his ankle ligaments, the unfortunate centre-half and captain has also knacked his knee. While I wish him a very speedy and full recovery, I can't help but feel that perhaps if he supported his local cheese industry and ate Wensleydale, he wouldn't be so brittle.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Another week, another car talk. Barack Obama stopped by a North Carolina truck factory on Wednesday to announce $1bn in tax credits and grants for alternative-energy cars and trucks. It was Obama's third speech on cars and fuel in an election battleground state in three weeks. The president has travelled from New Hampshire to Florida and now North Carolina to insulate himself from Republican attacks on rising gas prices and the on-again, off-again Keystone XL tar sand pipeline ahead of the general election. \"We can't just keep on relying on the old ways of doing business. We can't just rely on fossil fuels from the last century. We've got to continually develop new sources of energy,\" Obama said in his speech at the Daimler truck plant in Mount Holly North Carolina. The White House, briefing reporters on the plane and through a factsheet emailed out before the event, said Obama's factory tour was intended to spur the development of a new generation of clean, fuel-neutral cars: electric, natural gas, and alternative fuels. The Daimler plant is working to produce 18-wheeler trucks that use only half as much gas as current models. Long-haul trucks make up just 4% of all vehicles on the roads, according to the White House, but suck up 20% of all transport fuel in the country. The factory also makes hydrogen-powered trucks. The tax credits \u2013 which must be voted on by Congress \u2013 would help up to 15 cities and towns to pay for charging stations for electric cars and biofuel pumps for alternative fuel vehicles to encourage people to switch to electric cars. \"At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much natural gas, or flex-fuel or electric vehicles you have if there's no place to charge them up or fill them up,\" Obama said. The speech came just a few days after GM announced a five-week hiatus in the production of its Chevy Volt because of flagging demand. Obama is also asking Congress to expand the tax credit for advanced vehicles to $10,000 from $7,500, and to all fuels \u2013 including natural gas, which is not covered under the programme. It's unclear whether either programme will see the light of day, given Republicans' dominance in Congress and their opposition to Obama's clean energy agenda. The Republicans claim clean energy loans and grants are a waste of money \u2013 and have used the failure of the Solyndra solar power maker to try to discredit Obama's energy agenda. Earlier on Wednesday, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, told reporters Obama was bent on forcing up gas prices. \"When it comes to the rising cost of gas at the pump, it's my view that the administration's policies are actually designed to bring about higher gas prices,\" he said. But the White House \u2013 with its steady schedule of energy-focused events \u2013 is clearly positioning itself to tout its energy agenda at the election. Obama also used his speech in North Carolina to repeat his call for the repeal of billions in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. Subsidies were the main topic of his speech in the swing state of New Hampshire last week. The week before, Obama took on Republicans' attacks on gas prices in a speech in Miami. In late January, he visited the University of Michigan to talk up his electric vehicles programmes. All three are seen as battleground states in the November elections \u2013 but North Carolina is probably the biggest stretch for Obama. He was the first Democrat to win the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976. The Democrats are fighting hard to hang on, locating the party's convention in Charlotte, North Carolina this summer.",

And Gok's got the label to prove it \u2013 well, a tattoo on the back of his neck that says \"Made in China\". This tattoo is the inspiration for Gok's journey. But first, to Leicester to see Mr Wan senior who is neat, respectable, businesslike. How is it possible that this dignified man spawned a monster like Gok? They talk about race and ethnicity. Gok says he thinks of his father as British \"even though you talk funny and look a bit weird\". Dad says he'll always be Chinese: \"I don't look white am I, I'm yellow,\" he says. Gok has a good cackle and spills the tea. \"Did you wear one of those stupid hats?\" Gok asks. A lot of it comes down to clothes. Next, Gok hops on a plane heading east, to Hong Kong, then China proper. And he's like: \"Oh my god, this place is unbelievable, it's absolutely bonkers, oh my god, amazing, everyone's working so hard, oh my god, he's using an abacus, it's amazing, thank you very much indeed, you're amazing, thank you for your help, I don't know who you are, thank you very much, amazing, I love it, I don't eat meat, no meat, fish only, no meat, oh, I'm definitely not vegetarian any more, oh my god I'm going to say oh my god again, bloody hell, what's going on, welcome to China \u2026\" Something along those lines, anyway. It's not award-winning TV journalism that gets to the the very core of modern China, or exposes uncomfortable truths behind the world's fastest growing economy, but you wouldn't expect it to be. He does at least realise that some clothes factories are no better than sweatshops, but the ones he visits \u2013 vast places that make most of the world's jeans and bras \u2013 seem quite nice. There's no time for digging, anyway: he's off to visit a weird fake British village called Thames Town, where people actually live, but which is mainly used as a backdrop for wedding photos. Plus there's shopping to be done, of course, for crazy paper imitations of luxury goods (clothes, karaoke machines, air conditioning units), which he burns to help some of his dead ancestors in the afterlife. There is an element of Who Do You Think You Are? to it, but not enough. The family stuff is all a bit glossed-over and superficial, which is more disappointing than the unsurprising lack of investigative journalism. \"He's cousin William, that's my grandfather's house, that photo is my grandmother, there's my dad, oh my god he had so much hair, no time to hang about though \u2026\" He's not exactly digging deep to unearth \u2013 or to understand \u2013 his Chinese roots. Barely scratching the surface, really. But then he is only there for a week, and there's more shopping to be done, for fake stuff (like an \"eye-pad\"). There's even a fake Gok Wan to meet (possibly better than the original?). And there's obviously a lot more oh-my-godding to do. At the end of Gok's Chinese mini-break, Gok doesn't feel like he really fits in there. He's impressed and amazed, but also baffled. And the feeling is mutual; China doesn't really get him either. In this country, he has got used to (and I think loves) being loved, to people coming up, to chat and to get naked. Over there they mostly scream and run away. No wonder he feels he doesn't fit in. China may be the fastest growing this and that and everything else, and be about to take over and overtake the world, but it's not quite ready for Gok Wan.

It is in the right place, useful for passengers, and popular with airlines, leading to it becoming a world-class hub airport. Justine Greening's stated position is that \"if you were starting from scratch today you would not put Heathrow where it is\". Exactly, but we are not starting from scratch. Heathrow is in west London and positioned centrally to one of the most prosperous areas in Europe \u2013 the Bristol, Birmingham, west London and Southampton megalopolis. Moving to a windswept peninsula far to the east of London, one of the supported alternatives, would leave a great white hole and threaten the prosperity of the area that creates wealth for the whole of the UK. The estuary site has gained support recently simply so that London mayor Boris Johnson can make promises to west London's voters just before the May elections. Heaven knows this area of north Kent and east London needs all the development it can get, but starting from scratch without suitable road, rail, logistics support or a suitable pool of an estimated 76,000 skilled airport workers would end any scheme for a hub and overwhelm the economy of north Kent. Derek Munton Chair, Rochester and Strood constituency Labour party \u2022 The clamour for the aviation white paper to consider \"all options\" is hellbent on a third runway at Heathrow or possibly the insanity of building an island in the Thames estuary. Yet the very idea of a new hub airport in the north will not get a look in despite an eminently rational location south-east of Doncaster. Building a new hub at Robin Hood airport makes sense on many levels. It is in open countryside and surrounded by highly developed roads and rail. It is close to east coast ports. It has the third longest runway in England. Its approach and departure flight paths are over comparatively unpopulated areas, unlike the south-east. It would create tens if not hundreds of thousands of jobs in an area still suffering from 80s and 90s recessions. It would relieve Heathrow of all shuttle traffic from the north. It would take pressure off Manchester. It makes more sense than both of the leading options but it will not get a look in because it is a given that all major infrastructure development must be in the drought-stricken golden triangle.

      "bodyText": "Your report on the advantaged intakes enjoyed by many church schools is a welcome reminder that the Holy Spirit is unlikely to be the cause of their superior academic performance (Poor pupils less likely to attend church schools in England than rich neighbours, 6 March). However, the response of your leading article (6 March) \u2013 that the figures point to \"pausing for thought\" \u2013 is somewhat pusillanimous, to say the least. What holds good for church schools holds good for all schools: educational outcomes primarily reflect the socio-economic makeup of the pupil intake and, in a system as hierarchical as ours, it takes either extraordinary talent or extraordinary incompetence for a school to prove an exception to this rule. The mulish insistence by politicians that school intakes do not matter and that \"great leadership\" and \"inspiring teaching\" are all that is missing from the lives of the poor flies in the face of all evidence and is a dishonest attempt to avoid confronting powerful minorities in order to promote the common good. What that common good might be we can see in those education systems across the world, from Alberta to Shanghai, whose pupils leave our own for dead in international comparisons. Sadly, rather than learn from these examples, we have chosen to import failed models from Sweden and the US. Of course, by the time it becomes apparent that this policy has failed, our log-rolling secretary of state will have moved on and his successor will blame the teachers. Michael Pyke Campaign for State Education \u2022\u2008The final case study in your piece on church schools seems to me rather to undermine the argument of the rest of your coverage. Thorner CofE primary school, as the piece points out, is a voluntary-controlled school. This means that it uses the same criteria for admissions as a local authority school, usually things like siblings and distance from the school. Voluntary-controlled schools cannot use faith or church attendance as admission or oversubscription criteria. If Thorner's intake is wealthier than the surrounding postcode area, it is not because of faith-based selection by the school, but the result of selection by the parents who have chosen to apply for places there. Whatever one thinks of faith-based admission criteria (and personally I would love to see the back of this practice), it's not what is happening here. More nuanced research is needed in order to tease out what is going on. Rev Anne Le Bas Seal, Kent \u2022\u2008So church schools allegedly discriminate against the poor based on the dubious premise that, if the number of pupils receiving free school meals is low, this must mean that the majority of pupils come from \"well-heeled\" families. This ignores the fact that not all those who could benefit from free school meals qualify for them and families with a similar income who are not eligible are worse-off because they have to pay for meals. Then there are families who do not claim free school meals because of the stigmatising effect on their children; one of the reasons why the Child Poverty Action Group has called for all children to receive free school meals. Do you believe that if all schools were to become secular overnight, the problem of pushy parents trying to get their offspring into good schools would disappear? There are plenty of non-church schools that are equally oversubscribed by middle-class applicants and if, as the Church of England points out, local authorities manage the admissions in more that half of its schools then that hardly amounts to cherry-picking. Barry Wadeson Milton Keynes \u2022\u2008If the social profile of church schools in deprived areas includes more rich pupils than that of their immediate neighbourhood, this is because the churches have created schools on council estates to which the middle classes are prepared to send their children. I am surprised that organisations concerned about class divisions do not regard this as a commendable. It is certainly better than the situation in Bristol where even people living on council estates cannot be persuaded to send their children to the secondary schools on those estates. John Hall Stoke Bishop, Bristol \u2022\u2008As a retired deputy headteacher of a large Catholic comprehensive school and currently a governor of a small Catholic primary school (both having within their catchment areas postcodes recognised as being of significant social deprivation), I can confirm that in both establishments the number of pupils on free school meals (FSM) is well above national averages. Also it would be of statistical interest to analyse the remaining faith schools as to what their proportion of pupils were on FSM (ie in the Catholic sector: 23.7% at secondary level and 35.3% at primary) and comparing these with the remainder. Bogumit Polachowski Wirral, Merseyside \u2022\u2008Although your article mentions the fact that the state-funded Muslim schools have \"more than the local authority average of free school meal pupils\", not surprisingly the poor showing of church-run schools is used by the British Humanist Association (BHA) to call for \"the government to end faith-based selection in all state-funded schools\". One has to assume that the BHA's intention is to end what it sees as \"inequality\" and yet, in its zeal to make all schools secular, they would do away with parental choice for those of us who believe that faith does indeed have an important role to play in education. That's hardly equality by any stretch of the imagination. I have no wish to impose faith schools on every Muslim parent, let alone those of other and no faith. why does the BHA wish to impose its secular agenda on everyone, humanist or not?

It is a favourite of mine, and so it was with anticipation that last week, carrying a pond net, I decided to take a closer look. I was concerned at the colony of frogs that last year seemed to be decimated by various predators including herons. There is something special about pond-dipping as there is always the wonder and curiosity about peering in the net after the dip. As is often the case at this time of year, there was no sign of life, although most pond dwellers are secretive. Reports of the first local frogs' spawn, albeit near the coast, had reached me and I thought the frogs might just be at the pond. There was no sign of any frogs or spawn which would have been in clumps and quite noticeable. I dipped into the far side of a bank of weed and with indecent haste pulled the net towards me. The first thrill of looking into a pond net when I was a youngster has never left me, and it was still there as I looked into the dark mass at the bottom of the white net. At first there seemed nothing apart from dead plants, and then there were several pond snails and then \u2013 how exciting \u2013 a movement and there was a stickleback. It was the most common of all the sticklebacks, the three-spined, and it was a male already showing a flush of red along its flanks and throat. I always look carefully, hoping I might just see a very rare spineless one. They occur in Loch Ruthven, only a few miles away, so there is always a chance. I caught several more sticklebacks but still no sign of the frogs and I just hope it was just too early for them. A return visit is called for: any excuse to go to my favourite pond.",

      "body": "<p>The small pond is on the side of a very narrow road and most people would pass it without a second glance. It is a favourite of mine, and so it was with anticipation that last week, carrying a pond net, I decided to take a closer look. I was concerned at the colony of frogs that last year seemed to be decimated by various predators including herons. There is something special about pond-dipping as there is always the wonder and curiosity about peering in the net after the dip.</p> <p>As is often the case at this time of year, there was no sign of life, although most pond dwellers are secretive. Reports of the first local frogs' spawn,&#xa0;albeit near the coast, had&#xa0;reached me and I thought the frogs might just be at the pond. There was no&#xa0;sign of any frogs or spawn which would have been in clumps and quite noticeable. I dipped into the far side of&#xa0;a bank of weed and with indecent haste pulled the net towards me. The first thrill of looking into a pond net when I&#xa0;was a youngster has never left me, and&#xa0;it was still there as I looked into the&#xa0;dark mass at the bottom of the white&#xa0;net.</p> <p>At first there seemed nothing apart from dead plants, and then there were several pond snails and then \u2013 how exciting \u2013 a movement and there was a stickleback. It was the most common of all the sticklebacks, the three-spined, and it was a male already showing a flush of red along its flanks and throat. I always look carefully, hoping I might just see a very rare spineless one. They occur in Loch Ruthven, only&#xa0;a&#xa0;few miles away, so there is always&#xa0;a chance. I caught several more sticklebacks but still no sign of the frogs and I just hope it was just too early for them. A return visit is called for: any excuse to go to my favourite pond.</p>",

After stark warnings of possible liquidation, including one from the administrator Duff and Phelps, that fact only represents another \u2013 if the most striking \u2013 tier of bad news for increasingly anxious followers of the Scottish Premier League champions. So much uncertainty surrounds Rangers that it is exceptionally difficult not to infer that the hope of speeding up an exit from administration is a forlorn one. The specifics of the Rangers landscape aside, the Scottish game's wider commercial outlook has not appeared attractive to those looking to invest in football for some time. Thus far, Rangers' administrator has been unable to piece together precise levels of security over the company. It has also yet to fully ascertain what the make-up of the company voluntary arrangement it would use to positively exit administration would be. Attempts to secure funds which may be due to the club from external bank accounts have not yet been concluded and are subject to challenge from elsewhere. Those who suggest this will be a messy affair are operating in the realms of wild understatement. The picture remains more meaningfully clouded, as has been the case for month upon month, by the lack of a resolution to a tribunal worth tens of millions of pounds between the football club and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. Before that affair is decided, it is surely improbable that any benefactor will step forward to aid this desperate Rangers cause. Ironically Paul Murray, the man fronting a consortium looking to take the club over, previously used a television documentary to ask why on earth Craig Whyte bought Rangers from Sir David Murray with that very issue unresolved. Sir David Murray had taken years, after all, to finally dispose of his majority Rangers shareholding. Rangers' short- to medium-term income streams hardly look promising, something endorsed by confirmation that they will not compete in European competition next season. If insolvency beckons, that enforced absence would stretch for another two years. The advance sale by Whyte of 100,000 season tickets for Ibrox over four years further impacts on Rangers' ability to raise working capital. Unless that arrangement with Ticketus can be reversed \u2013 and there has thus far been no indication of that \u2013 it will merely serve as one of many damaging legacies of the Whyte regime. Without meaningful funds to retain or purchase players, the spectre of Celtic dominating the on-field scene for the foreseeable future is perfectly plausible. History suggests it dangerous to blithely write off either half of the Old Firm at any point \u2013 neither club has ever been allowed the last laugh \u2013 but Rangers lack any basic pathway out of their predicament. Celtic's present on- and off-field strength only serves as a further material blow to Glasgow's blue half. If the key Rangers selling points to players \u2013 regular trophy success, decent salaries and regular participation in Europe \u2013 are removed, any journey back will be a turbulent one. It is worth remembering that the Rangers squad was widely reckoned to be in need of urgent improvement even before administration arrived. It may actually be a sensible policy for Scottish clubs to seriously reduce overheads but such a plan sits awkwardly at Rangers, where for all but brief periods of their entire existence, success has been expected rather than pined for. This will be a harrowing time. Duff and Phelps has been subject to increased scrutiny itself. And rightly so;. In what seems a desperate attempt to preserve playing assets and some semblance of a team, it has been left with a financial situation which is unsustainable. To outsiders, the administrator has seemed to act indecisively. A further intrigue surrounding any insolvency event relates to the structure of the SPL itself. This would merge political and commercial interests to likely spectacular effect. Fevered speculation already surrounds whether or not Rangers' fellow top-flight clubs would be willing to admit a reformed company back into the league. Celtic are known to be unsympathetic to their city rivals' cause, but those in boardrooms of smaller clubs are firmly in the grip of banks and balance sheets. Sky Sports' broadcasting deal, despite lobbying to the contrary, has four Old Firm league matches per season at its core. Those who accentuate a more competitive SPL on account of Rangers' regression must accept that that has no direct link to quality on offer; stagnation would be a real danger. Such a debate, however, is too often clouded by people's emotional attachment to a particular club. Given there is no precedent for dealing with the liquidation of a club in the SPL, it is unclear how such an event would play out. Rangers hope to avoid discovering how it might.

The 21-year-old from Frimley came home in 2min 9.33 sec on day five of the British Gas Swimming Championships, shaving more than a second off his previous best and recording the fastest time in the world this year. It required a late surge from last year's silver medallist to secure a Team GB place and beat Michael Jamieson and Kris Gilchrist. Second-placed Jamieson also recorded a personal best time of 2:09.84 to secure a place for London 2012 but the 23-year-old Glaswegian was more relieved than ecstatic having failed with his initial attempt to make the Olympics when he could finish only third in Sunday's 100m breaststroke final. \"It was hard coming back after the 100m and although I never imagined I wouldn't make the team, I was made to work hard by Andrew,\" said Jamieson. \"I know there is a lot of work to do between now and the summer.\" That was a sentiment shared by Willis but not surprisingly, his mood was more upbeat. \"I wasn't expecting to be that quick; my coach said go for it and that is what I did,\" he said. \"This week has been nerve-wracking but all the hard work has paid off. It will be a few days before qualifying [for the Olympics] sinks in.\" Gilchrist missed the qualifying time by just over two-hundredths of a second and is now likely to retire after a career studded by a 2006 European bronze medal. There were best wishes from the Edinburgh man, however, for Willis and Jamieson as the pair look to become the first Britons since Nick Gillingham at the 1992 Barcelona Games to win an Olympic breaststroke medal. In the women's 200m butterfly, meanwhile, Ellen Gandy followed her victory in Sunday's 100 butterfly final with a new British record of 2min 6.01 sec and another gold medal. Jemma Lowe came second in 2min 6.37sec and also did enough to secure a place in Team GB having finished third in the 100m butterfly. \"I'm relieved,\" said the 22-year-old. \"I knew she [Gandy] was going to be fast and I'm just glad I could also make the time.\" In the men's 100m freestyle final, Simon Burnett and James Disney-May took gold and silver respectively but neither recorded the required qualifying time and so, if they choose, will have to return to June's ASA Championships in Sheffield for a final chance to make the Games.",

      "bodyText": "A video calling to bring a notorious Ugandan warlord to justice has gone massively viral online, but serious concerns have also been raised about the group responsible for posting it. The so-called Kony2012 initiative, launched by the non-profit group Invisible Children, demands the removal of Ugandan guerrilla leader Joseph Rao Kony. As head of the Lord's Resistance Army, engaged in a complex and continuing conflict, Kony has terrorised villagers in at least four central African countries for nearly two decades. He stands accused of overseeing the systematic kidnapping of countless African children; brainwashing the boys into fighting for him, turning the girls into sex slaves and killing those who don't comply. His forces are believed to have slaughtered tens of thousands of people and are known for hacking the lips off their victims. Kony has been wanted by the International Criminal Court since 2005 on charges that include crimes against humanity. He has been living in the bush outside of Uganda since that time. The US designated the LRA a terrorist group after September 11, and in 2008 began actively supporting the Ugandan military. In October the president deployed 100 combat-equipped troops \u2013 mostly Special Operations Forces \u2013 to Uganda to advise regional military units in capturing or killing Kony. Yesterday, Invisible Children posted a half-hour video aimed at making sure that mission is accomplished. The organisation argues that by making Kony \"famous\" pressure will be kept on US policymakers to ensure he is removed. The video has already received well-over 7m views and the hashtag #StopKony \u2013 as well as the words \"Uganda\" and \"Invisible Children\" \u2013 have been added to Twitter's top 10 worldwide trends. Numerous celebrities have publicly expressed their support for the cause. Still, some have raised concerns about the organisation behind Kony2012 and the implications of its efforts. The Tumblr page, Visible Children has collected a number of these critiques. The non-profit's financial statements show that only 32% of the $8.6m it spent last year went to direct services. Meanwhile Foreign Affairs magazine has accused the organization of \"manipulat[ing] facts for strategic purposes.\" Charity Navigator has given Invisible Children a two-star rating in accountability out of a possible four. Critics point out that the campaign calls on the public to pressure the US to continue working with the Ugandan military, an organisation that has its own record of abuses. \"The Ugandan army continues to commit politically motivated abuses in Uganda,\" Maria Burnett, senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, Africa Division, told the Guardian. \"We have documented numerous cases in which they've been involved in torture and arbitrary arrests, as well as a score of killings of unarmed protesters and bystanders during political demonstrations in the past three years.\" The nature of the US's relationship to Uganda is also potentially problematic, according to Burnett. \"The US, as far as we know, is trying to advise on how to apprehend, or remove from the battlefield, Kony and his leadership,\" said Burnett. \"I have some concerns about what the US longer term plans are and what kind of exit strategy they may or may not have, but working to apprehend LRA leaders and protect civilians is crucial.\"",

Meanwhile Foreign Affairs magazine has accused the organization of \"manipulat[ing] facts for strategic purposes.\" Charity Navigator has given Invisible Children a two-star rating in accountability out of a possible four. </p> <p>Critics point out that the campaign calls on the public to pressure the US to continue working with the Ugandan military, an organisation that has its own record of abuses. </p> <p>\"The Ugandan army continues to commit politically motivated abuses in Uganda,\" Maria Burnett, senior researcher with <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/09/19/uprooted-and-forgotten-0\">Human Rights Watch, Africa Division</a>, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"We have documented numerous cases in which they've been involved in torture and arbitrary arrests, as well as a score of killings of unarmed protesters and bystanders during political demonstrations in the past three years.\"</p> <p>The nature of the US's relationship to Uganda is also potentially problematic, according to Burnett.</p> <p>\"The US, as far as we know, is trying to advise on how to apprehend, or remove from the battlefield, Kony and his leadership,\" said Burnett.</p> <p>\"I have some concerns about what the US longer term plans are and what kind of exit strategy they may or may not have, but working to apprehend LRA leaders and protect civilians is crucial.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "As professional golf enters a new golden age, where the coming Masters at Augusta is the most eagerly awaited major championship of recent times, there is at least one man who refuses to be swept away. Witness Tiger Woods, anchored to the floor, indifference etched upon his face. \"Well, I think every year is exciting for me,\" the former world No1 deadpanned when asked if 2012, with the rise of Rory McIlroy and his own return to form, alongside that of Phil Mickelson, ranks as the most exciting since 2000 when Woods won three majors. \"I have been in this situation before [when] it was Vijay and myself and Phil and Ernie were all going at it for a number of years. So now it is just a different crop of guys.\" The names may be different, as Woods said, but the challenges facing him in his quest to add to his 14 major championships \u2013 or at least win his first official event since 2009 \u2013 are on an altogether different level. Singh, Els Goosen and Mickelson were all fine players in their prime but relative to the Woods at the peak of his powers they were distinctly second best. They knew it \u2013 indeed Mickelson and Els were happy to publicly acknowledge it \u2013 and Woods knew it. It must be a great feeling stepping on to the 1st tee in possession of such a mental edge, which perhaps explains why Woods is not so keen to wax lyrical about the current golfing landscape and the new world No1. McIlroy has been happy to pay due respect to the American's achievements and credit him as an inspirational figure but he has never described the former world No1 in language that would betray an inferiority complex. The Northern Irishman has always said his boyhood hero is beatable. Of course words are one thing, deeds another. Yet on Sunday McIlroy walked the walk, as they like to say in these parts, winning the Honda Classic in the face of a vintage performance from Woods, who shot a 62 on Sunday \u2013 the best final round of his PGA Tour career \u2013 and still finished second to the 22-year-old. A generation of golfers would have crumbled as huge roars greeted Woods's eagle on the 72nd hole at the Honda. McIlroy responded by rolling in a birdie putt on the 13th green and following that with five straight pars to win by two shots. Woods has never been at the front of the queue when it comes to praising his fellow competitors but even he was impressed by his young rival's effort. \"He made a few mistakes but he recovered every time. And you're not going to play perfectly all the time, people don't realise that. You're going to make mistakes, which he did, and that's fine. He recovered. He did all of the things that you needed to do.\" Typically, Woods leavened his praise for McIlroy with caution. It is one thing to reach the summit, but quite another thing to stay there. \"He's got to continue to get better, because everyone else is. Everyone else is out here working hard to become a better golfer, and more consistent player. And he didn't get here by not practising. So continue to do what he's doing and I'm sure he's done a lot of different things. He's working on his game. He's working on his fitness and all that has compiled a pretty good record.\" A pretty good record? McIlroy has won three times in his last 12 outings, and finished runner-up four times. That is better than pretty good. Dare it be said, it is almost Tiger-esque, although the Northern Irishman was quick to dismiss any such comparisons. He said: \"I'm going to let other people do that. I'm not going to try and compare myself to anyone else. I've never said that I want to be the next anyone. I just want to be the first Rory McIlroy. However good that turns out to be, then I'll try my best to win tournaments and to win majors and to be the best player in the world. \"I never set out to win 18 majors like Tiger has. I've always just wanted to win golf tournaments, ultimately to win majors, and to be No1 in the world. And I've been lucky enough to win a major and get to the No1 position, but there's still a long road ahead and I feel like I can accomplish a lot more.\" McIlroy will get to work on that immediate ambition on Thursday morning when he will tee off alongside Lee Westwood and Luke Donald in the opening round of the Cadillac Championship at Doral. Given the expectations, anything less than a top-five finish for McIlroy will be judged as a disappointment. If he wins, then even Tiger Woods may be forced to concede that he is now second best.",

I accept the practical point that a lot of porn degrades women intentionally so can't be made without the humiliation of women involved in it; and I accept the theoretical point that it is made for the male gaze, so women aren't agents of their own pleasure, they're just accessories to male pleasure. But I can't make the leap from there to any serious belief that the act of filming two people having sex is necessarily demeaning to women. I don't accept that women who like porn have somehow been enslaved by a male cultural coding \u2013 or if they have, what is anybody's sexuality but a series of triggers and preferences they've picked up on the way to maturity? Nor am I incensed about what we'd call \"raunch\" culture, in which a porn aesthetic has seeped into \"normal\" life, and young women on primetime television might casually wear outfits that 30 years ago you'd only have been able to buy in a specialist shop. Sure, I think there's a solid Marxist critique to be made of it, about market forces and how they flatten everything into one acceptable, sellable shape, and in so doing taint physical intimacy, which is idiosyncratic in its nature. But at the same time I think it's in the nature of young, beautiful people to flaunt themselves to one another. The idea that you can banish the objectification of the body, in either direction, from the business of being human I find neither realistic nor especially desirable. At the opposite end of this male cultural coding, you have the burqa, and I no longer feel strongly about that. I used to think that it was a tragedy that a woman's dress and, by extension, her public identity, should have to be mediated through male paranoia. But that was before all the attempts I've seen at intervention \u2013 from the French law against the veil, which has the effect of ejecting girls from school, to any given liberal argument that takes as its necessary starting point the laughable idea that western women are somehow immune to the exigencies of male paranoia. And just while we're doing feminist heresies, I don't think that thin models make young girls anorexic. I think that's actually an insult to women, to suggest that the cause and effect of a mental illness should be so bleeding obvious. It sounds like I've mellowed, but in fact, on other things, I've become more hardline. I no longer think it's possible to be a rightwing feminist. It makes no logical sense to seek equality just for your own gender then step away from egalitarianism more generally. Pragmatically, what kind of equality are you talking about if it only applies among women? Are you just fighting for some kind of tiered parity, where middle-class women have the same rights and prospects as middle-class men, and working-class women have the rights and prospects of working-class men? I have not turned into one of those beaming, inclusive feminists who looks at Louise Mensch (to take a wild for instance) and says, \"Sure, you're anti-abortion, you're rabidly free market, you chip away at all the financial mechanisms that make work possible for mothers and then stop in the middle of a parliamentary inquiry and say 'I've got to leave at lunchtime to do the school run', which does working mothers no favours \u2026 but you self-identify as a feminist, and that's what counts.\" There are plenty of conversations in the name of feminism that I would happily stamp out like fags in a dry forest. If I read one more article in which someone confuses sisterliness with feminism and wonders why women aren't nicer to one another in the workplace, or on Twitter, or in parliament, or at Asda, I don't think my spirit can take it. But my International Women's Day pledge is for us to act more like a football team and less like synchronised swimmers. Synchronicity is a mug's game, and things move faster when everybody concentrates on what they're good at. There is no way we'll ever reach an agenda where all of us agree, in equal measure, with everything on it. I've seen larger, more vivid, more optimistic feminist gatherings in the past six months than in the rest of my life put together, but not one of them has reached its end without a load of time being wasted on one of these classic faultlines: someone frozen out for admitting she likes Debbie Does Dallas; someone else saying, \"What do I care about some middle-income woman's childcare arrangements when rape is being used as an act of war in the Congo?\"; or some feud erupting about whether Hooters is more or less sexist than David Cameron. The women's movement has a problem with ideological purism: in its discourse it demands not only that we all adhere to a central set of truths but also that we agree on their priority. This task is impossible \u2013 you cannot agree a priority between the defence of a woman's reproductive rights and the rights of women to be protected from violence. You cannot say that, because women suffer injustices far more severe in other parts of the world, a woman who's had to give up work in Harlesden because her tax credits were cut is not a feminist issue. You cannot hope that a belief in equality will lead everybody to the same conclusions about body shapes, or all-women shortlists, or gender essentialism. When we try to present a united front, we're not asking too much of ourselves, we're asking too little: waiting for an unattainable unity is just another way of doing nothing. When we divide, we can burn more brightly in many places. Twitter: @zoesqwilliams",

The 48-year-old White is contracted to the Brumbies in Australia and has not formally applied for the England post. He is, nevertheless, refusing to confirm he will not coach at the 2015 World Cup. \"I can never rule that out, let's be honest,\" he said. \"When there's six World Cup-winning coaches that are alive and I'm the only guy actively involved in rugby, chances are that speculation will always be there.\" As things stand he has pledged to remain in Canberra until at least the end of the current Super Rugby season, which would make him unavailable for England's tour to South Africa in June. Nick Mallett and Stuart Lancaster are the other main names in the frame, with the RFU's new chief executive Ian Ritchie saying last week he wanted to make an appointment this month. The RFU will not confirm the timing of Lancaster's interview for the job, although Sir Ian McGeechan, a selection panel member, attended training in Bagshot on Wednesday. Sir Graham Henry, meanwhile, has agreed to a part-time consultancy role assisting Argentina's leading rugby coaches.

      "bodyText": "Robert Quick, formerly Britain's top counter-terrorism officer, has alleged that his senior Scotland Yard colleagues buckled under Conservative party pressure and withdrew their support for the investigation of a Tory frontbench spokesman who had received leaks which endangered national security. Quick told the Leveson inquiry on Wednesday that the arrest in 2008 of the Conservative immigration spokesman, Damian Green, sparked outrage from senior Tories and Conservative-leaning papers. Quick said the furore led the then acting Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, to ask him to halt the criminal investigation. Quick alleged that Green had not just received the leaks but encouraged a civil servant to pass on information that might have endangered national security. He said his investigation began after a complaint from the government that material had been stolen from the safe of the then home secretary's private office. Green, who is now an immigration minister, was arrested in November 2008 by Scotland Yard. The arrest and search of Green's House of Commons office was condemned by David Cameron, then leader of the opposition, and London mayor Boris Johnson, who is now in control of setting the Met budget and strategic priorities, as well as having the power to fire the commissioner. Christopher Galley, a civil servant, was also arrested. The Crown Prosecution Service decided in April 2009 not to prosecute Green or Galley. Quick said that Galley phoned Green after being released and was told he should \"plead not guilty and 'do not mention David Davis'\", the senior Tory whom Galley had first contacted offering to leak information to embarrass the Labour government. Quick said he had thoroughly checked the law at every stage and had the support of Stephenson before the arrest. But after the Tory explosion of anger, the acting commissioner withdrew his support, Quick claimed. The row erupted weeks after London's Tory mayor had in effect fired Sir Ian Blair as Met commissioner. Quick told the inquiry that Stephenson \"looked anxious\" and claimed he had written his resignation letter after Tory criticism of Green's arrest. The Met claims that Stephenson, who went on to be appointed commissioner, had in fact written a statement saying he would leave the force in April when his contract expired. Quick agreed with Leveson's suggestion that dropping the inquiry would give the appearance at least of caving in to political pressure. The officer said Stephenson asked him to stop the inquiry: \"I expressed the view that I did not think it justifiable or ethical to stop the investigation purely on the basis of a controversy that appeared not to be driven by the public, but by those who may have a vested interest in deterring the police from undertaking such investigation.\" Quick claimed Tory-supporting papers smeared him, he suspects with help from a senior police insider. He said he had been forced to move his children out of his home amid security fears after the Mail on Sunday published details about a wedding car business run by his wife, Judith, and staffed by former police officers. Stephenson and Dick Fedorcio, head of press at Scotland Yard, had failed to try to intervene to stop the paper publishing the story, Quick claimed. Quick apologised in December 2008 after claiming the Tories and their supporters were \"mobilised \u2026 in a wholly corrupt way\" against his investigation into Green's relationship with the Home Office civil servant. Counsel to the inquiry Robert Jay QC said: \"It all suggests a campaign from whoever to smear you in relation to the Green inquiry, to use a range of strategies.\" Quick said that during the Green saga he came to believe some press leaks were so well informed that someone senior at Scotland Yard must have been briefing the media to undermine the investigation. A report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said the use of police resources in the Green investigation was \"debatable\", while an internal police review said Green's arrest was \"not proportionate\". Quick, then head of counter-terrorism and an assistant commissioner, resigned from the Met in April 2009 over a separate mistake, when he was photographed entering No 10 with a briefing note on counter-terrorism on display. At the Leveson inquiry, he claimed that the former assistant commissioner John Yates had resisted an attempt to examine his phone records over allegations he was leaking information from the cash for honours investigation, saying he was \"very well connected\". Quick, then chief constable of Surrey, said he was called in to review the criminal investigation led by Yates. He gave it a clean bill of health but, in January 2007, Quick was called in again after Britain's top civil servant, Gus O'Donnell, complained that the police were leaking details to the media. O'Donnell specifically named Yates as the source of the leaks from the investigation into the then Labour government. Quick alleged that Stephenson, the then Met deputy commissioner, did not implement his recommendation that the phone records of Yates should be examined for evidence of whether he was leaking against the Labour government. Quick alleged that he clashed with Yates over this suggestion and that Yates told him: \"No Bob, I am very well connected.\" Quick told Leveson his review found no evidence implicating Yates as the leaker: \"I sensed Assistant Commissioner Yates was clearly sensitive \u2013 as I think I would be \u2013 to an intrusive process like that.\" Last week, Yates in his evidence denied leaking information about the cash for peerages investigation, saying some of the most sensitive information gathered by police is still not known to the public. Quick said Yates's media contacts troubled him, especially after he saw him having a drink with a Daily Mail crime journalist, Stephen Wright, whose paper was, he said, trying to \"demolish\" the then commissioner Sir Ian Blair. Quick said this contact was \"extraordinary\". In 2000, Quick, then part of Scotland Yard's anti-corruption command, wanted to investigate newspapers after a covert operation revealed corrupt payments to police officers for information. Quick added that it struck him at the time as possible that newspaper organisations were aware of the reasons for the payments and were themselves complicit in making corrupt payments to police officers. His report was submitted to his then boss, Andy Hayman, but no action was taken, the inquiry heard. Quick also said it was clear in 2000 that tabloid journalists, most likely with their bosses' blessing, were bribing officers: \"There were considerable grounds to believe that journalists from tabloid newspapers were corruptors.\"",

      "bodyText": "Mitt Romney isn't a natural campaigner. On the stump he delivers wooden speeches that rarely last more than 15 minutes, then does a quick blast of glad-handing before promptly disappearing, leaving the core volunteers upon whom his campaign depends blinking into thin air. And the longer the battle for the Republican nomination drags on, the more Romney's lack of engagement with rank-and-file Republicans becomes exposed. As the conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer put it on Fox News: \"He gets weaker, not stronger, I think, with every week.\" The weariness of the candidate was evident when he took to the stage in a ballroom in the Westin Copley hotel in Boston's historic downtown on Tuesday night this week. His message to his faithful supporters in the state he calls his home was not exactly exultant. \"There'll be good days, there'll be bad days. But on November 6 we'll stand united having not only won an election but having saved a future.\" Tomorrow, he said, they would wake up and start all over again, as they battled day by day, step by step, to change America. This is indeed turning into a step-by-step, day-by-day struggle towards the nomination, not so much a victory march as a painfully prolonged crawl. Yes, Romney took six out of the 10 Super Tuesday states, most notably the bellwether Ohio. Now, more than ever, he owns the title of Republican frontrunner. But \"frontrunner\" is a world away from \"nominee\", and the process of converting one to the other is proving excruciating. The squeaky finish in Ohio, where Romney defeated his main rival, Rick Santorum, by just one point, keeps Santorum's hopes alive and will see him carry on his bloody fight to Kansas and Illinois later this month. Similarly, Newt Gingrich's victory in his home state of Georgia may not impress many, but it's enough within his own political bubble to drive him on to the other southern states, Alabama and Mississippi, next Tuesday. And Ron Paul will go all the way to the Republican convention in Florida in August, because he's Ron Paul. Romney's weary words are not just a reflection that he failed to stamp out his three rivals. It's also a symptom of a primary season that has been singularly \u2013 perhaps historically \u2013 brutal. Barbara Bush, wife of the first President Bush and no stranger to campaign trails herself, has dubbed 2012 \"the worst campaign I've ever seen in my life \u2026 It's too ugly, I really don't like it.\" Michael Wissot, senior strategist at Luntz Global, who advised John McCain in both his presidential runs in 2000 and 2008, agrees that this year has turned into a uniquely vitriolic affair. \"The Republican party is redirecting its anger against Barack Obama against itself. Hostility has been taken to an extreme \u2013 I can't recall such harsh language between candidates.\" Wissot puts that down to this year's innovation \u2013 the injection of massive sums of private campaign money through so-called Super Pacs, which has in turn unleashed a tsunami of negative advertising. \"That's been deeply uncomfortable for Romney, because he's not naturally a flame thrower,\" he said. Santorum, by contrast, speaks for an hour and shows a much more visceral connection with his crowd. Romney aides are putting on a brave face. His senior aide, Eric Fehrnstrom, tweeted on Tuesday night: \"Romney didn't just win Super Tuesday \u2013 he crushed it. Six of 10 states, amassing nearly 40% of the delegates for the nomination.\" Nice try. But look at it the other way. In only three of the 10 states \u2013 Idaho, Massachusetts and Virginia \u2013 did Romney command a majority. In the remaining seven, more conservatives voted against than for him. That inability of the Republicans to settle on a candidate this year is ominous not just for Romney, but for the entire conservative movement. It points to a seething discontent within the ranks, a suspicion of the party's leadership, and \u2013 most disturbingly for the future \u2014 a fundamental disagreement over what conservatism means. Does it mean a devotion to social and moral righteousness, to God and family values \u2013 the kind of conservatism beloved in the deep south and evangelical states such as Iowa? The kind of conservatism represented by Santorum. Or does it mean a commitment to good economic management, to balancing the books and making sure the free market works? The kind of conservatism championed by Romney. \"This is exposing an immense divide between the Christian conservative fundamentalist wing and the more internationalist and economic wing associated with Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and the first President Bush,\" says David King, a public policy expert at Harvard Kennedy School. King sees the enduring threat of Santorum as an expression of distrust of Romney among evangelical conservatives, particularly in southern states. They are suspicious of his stance on social issues and wary of him as a Mormon, a faith they dismiss as a cult. \"The distrust of Mormonism is a huge factor this election,\" King says. With the nomination process stretching out into the far distance, it's becoming a race all about stamina, resilience and, in Romney's case, patience. \"This is heavy going for Romney, who would like by now to have locked up the nomination,\" Wissot says. \"But he has to be careful not to come across as too ambitious.\" In King's view, the campaign that is the worst that Barbara Bush has ever seen is poised to get far worse. \"If the US economy continues to improve \u2013 as it looks like it will \u2013 then this fundamental divide between social and economic conservatives will grow and the Republican infighting will intensify,\" he says. All of which is music to Obama's ears. While the Republicans slug it out, he is quietly, but steadily, amassing the largest political war chest the world has ever seen and is preparing to wage the first billion-dollar campaign in history.",

While the Republicans slug it out, he is quietly, but steadily, amassing the largest political war chest the world has ever seen and is preparing to wage the first billion-dollar campaign in history.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shadow ministers are preparing a last-ditch attempt to delay the health bill next week, as most signs pointed to the bill reaching the statute book on 20 March, prompting a new two-year argument outside parliament on the bill's true impact on the NHS. Ministers and officials acknowledge in private, with an almost gallows humour, the political damage caused by the bill. They think the sooner it is law and out of the limelight, the better. No more amendments or pauses will be contemplated. The hysterical predictions about its impact can then be exposed, ministers argue. But Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, was refusing to give up the fight, even though the Lords had voted through some of the most controversial measures on Tuesday night with large majorities. He admitted: \"One of the frustrating things in the past fortnight is that the more friendless this bill becomes, the more determined the government seems to be to push it through. \"I hope the dynamic can still be changed, but it is getting desperately late.\" He is pinning his remaining hopes on three external forces. First, a tribunal \u2013 probably this week \u2013 may rule the NHS risk assessment should be published , which is bound to lead to an appeal by the government. If so, Burnham hopes peers at the third reading next week will delay the bill for a further month until the risk assessment is published. Lord Owen, the former SDP leader who went down a storm at the NHS workers' rally tonight, is likely to try to move for such a delay next week. Labour peers, disappointed by the scale of their defeats this week, still say there is a realistic chance crossbench peers could be persuaded to delay the bill on this basis. Second, it is likely that two further royal colleges will come out against the bill shortly, leaving an embarrassed coalition government in the awkward position of supporting a bill designed to empower professionals, but deserted by health professional bodies themselves. The Royal College of Surgeons will meet on Thursday after a demand for an extraordinary general meeting was accepted. Up until now, the RCS has refused to oppose the bill outright, preferring engagement on specific issues. The Royal College of Physicians is due to complete a survey of its 30,000 members next Thursday, and is likely to join opposition. Burnham's third hope is that the Lib Dem activists at their Gateshead conference this weekend will stand up to pressure from their leaders and vote to drop the bill, a decision that would be a huge embarrassment for Nick Clegg. On Friday, the party's federal conference committee will have to choose between two rival emergency amendments to put forward for debate \u2013 one opposing the bill outright and another saying the bill has been amended enough to make it worth supporting. The latter amendment, supported by Lady Williams, argues that significant changes have been made to the bill as a result of Lib Dem pressure in the Lords, including \"ensuring that competition in the NHS is in the interests of patients, based on quality not price; securing the commissioning process against damaging conflicts of interest; ensuring that any profits from treating private patients in foundation trust hospitals are invested in the NHS; [and] underpinning the independence of public health\". The underlying argument is that the Lib Dems have made the NHS better protected from the private sector than it had been under Labour, an argument Burnham rejects as \"the most distorting piece of spin I have ever heard. The whole point of this bill is that it takes the NHS in a new direction.\" Williams has admitted frustration in the Lords that the detailed virtues and vices of the bill are now little debated as two big entrenched encampments face each other. She complained that the legitimate balanced role of competition in the NHS was being forgotten. She told peers : \"I am thoroughly fed up with reading pieces on social network sites such as Twitter, which have presented the debate in terms of how we must be in favour of marketisation. That is simply absurd and it makes me angry. It adds to what has become a silly debate, a fictional debate. I am fed up with reading about how I am actually a secret marketiser when I know when perfectly well I am not.\" Indeed it must be frustrating for peers. Few will have followed the complex proceedings, and compromises, over the role of Monitor, national tariffs, and the expansion of competition. Williams retains a special status in her party, and she must know she will have disappointed many by her judgment call \u2013 one she admits may prove to be wrong. The weekend conference will reveal whether she can take her unhappy party with her.",

This hour-long special documents Walliams' journey, from Gloucester all the way to Westminster Bridge. As one might suspect, the level of sewage in the Thames does unpleasant things to the body, yet his sheer joy at completing the task makes for heartwarming TV. Gwilym Mumford White Heat 9pm, BBC2 Our friends in the south? It's 1965 and charismatic student Jack wants to \"construct a model of living based on equality\". In other words, he's a well-heeled rebel with a flat in Tufnell Park to let out. Enter a motley collection of half-a-dozen sharers who set up home against background noise caused by the passing-of-the-old-guard death of Winston Churchill. Told in flashback, White Heat will follow the seven through to the present day. This scene-setting opener is rather meandering, but the performances are excellent, especially Claire Foy as nascent feminist Charlotte. Jonathan Wright Pramface 9pm, BBC3 The slow-burning comedy burns even slower. So slow, in fact, that it seems to be missing the comedy. Jamie hasn't heard from Laura, who's now 12 weeks pregnant and settling into university, so he decides to stalk her. He's clumsily aided by sidekick Mike, whose clown-like antics might raise the chances of a smirk. Earnest best friend Beth is still scheming to win Jamie's heart, but a night of disco bowling fails to ignite romance. Hannah Verdier Catholics 9pm, BBC4 This final episode examines the role of women, an investigation Richard Alwyn undertakes by parking himself at Westminster Cathedral and speaking to female congregants, staff and volunteers. Alwyn's subjects are aware of the apparent contradictions of their faith. Jennie, in her late 60s, resents the repressive education to which she was subjected. One regular attends despite being denied communion as a divorcee, another less frequent visitor is troubled by the church's attitude to Aids and contraception. It\u00b9s hard to know whether to find their continued loyalty impressive or infuriating. Andrew Mueller The Sarah Millican Television Programme 10pm, BBC2 The exemplary standup gets her own show. It's part monologue, part chat about things she likes watching on TV, with the relevant bods joining her for, as Partridge put it, sofa-based chat. Tonight's focus is on wildlife and dating shows, and her guests are Chris Packham and \"sexpert\" Tracey Cox. With her warmth, citrus tongue and some seriously filthy mime skills, this is going to be fun. Julia Raeside The Singing Detective 10pm, BBC4 The rerun of Dennis Potter's classic drama concludes with Michael Gambon's Philip Marlow reaching a crisis point as the past and present, fantasy and reality, again collide. Newbies shouldn't expect a wholly clear resolution, but watching the way Potter weaves together his themes is far more rewarding. Hopefully the success of this rerun will prompt more repeats of Potter \u2013 not just well-remembered work such as Pennies From Heaven, but less well-received pieces that are now surely due for reappraisal, such as Blackeyes (1989) and the posthumously shown Karaoke and Cold Lazarus (1996).

      "bodyText": "All families are valuable but some are more valuable than others. It's good to have it spelled out sometimes and, right now, the group of men who rule over us are doing so fairly clearly. Funny to think that what used to be a somewhat controversial view unless you were au fait with Engels \u2013 that modern family structure is little to do with love or romance but simply about guaranteeing paternity and the passing on of property via inheritance \u2013 is now openly articulated by the right. Not so much the love-and-romance bit \u2013 they aren't fools \u2013 but certainly the view is everywhere that the job of government is to keep the system in place by propping up marriage. So are weddings. Modern conservatives, by which I mean politicians of all parties, don't identify such social engineering as vulgar Marxism any more. No, this is \"family values\". Everyone cares enormously about families; well, some families. Ones who have done the right thing and got themselves a \u00a32m house to live in. Why should they pay more tax? We're talking here about 74,000 people. A new oppressed minority. What about the men who go out and earn an OK wage, but are married to \"stay-at-home mums\" and will now lose child benefit. Poor things. Except they are not poor. What about gay people getting married? This will clearly up the divorce rate of the happy heterosexuals because there is nothing like a Big Fat Gay Wedding with, say, a reading from Rachel Cusk to make couples disintegrate on the spot. I had not put all these Tory proposals together until the Daily Telegraph did. They have a unifying theme, according to an editorial that said: \"They all risk undermining the traditional family.\" When I see a picture of Cameron, Osborne, Clegg and Alexander sitting around a table plotting, I don't see much undermining of anything except that old adage \"women and children first\". I do think, when I see them squabbling about tax, that ties should be taxed. I acknowledge, though, that's a quick fix. I also see the slashing of public-sector jobs, changes to legal aid, the closing of refuges, the stigmatising of single parents (rarely described as \"stay-at-home mums\"), all being done in the name of financial necessity, though driven by a core belief. While the government professes to a minimal state agenda, these are highly interventionist and gendered policies. Some Tories are fairly upfront about it. Others claim not to notice, but the conservative nostalgia that wants to push women back into the home depends on a supply of stable partners with stable jobs. There is a good bit of work to be done on that front. This political fantasy: that we can somehow return to previous levels of growth that will provide good men with good jobs sustains the family-values brigade. Whatever optimism there is about recovery, Vince Cable's anxiety about a lack of \"compelling vision\" is telling. The government is split now over taxation because this is pitting present wealth against possible future wealth. They don't want to tax aspiration. Who would, they ask. Me, actually, as it's another bit of political ad-speak. Most people aspire to get by. Many people aspire to a family holiday or to not have to get in debt if their boiler breaks. Those who aspire to enormous riches will always have a go if they think they are hard enough. Aspiration, though, is also being redefined. If cuts in child benefits penalise \"stay-at-home mums\", as we were told, what are women meant to aspire to? Dual-income families are seen as undermining \"the traditional family\" rather than being part of modern life's rich tapestry. So I guess single parents are undermining the ideal even more. Auberon Waugh once wrote that the children of divorced parents should simply be put to death. I actually prefer this extreme Swiftian logic to the coalition's remorseless \"caring\". Inevitably, the effects of austerity are felt by all kinds of families, mostly economically. But currently the tax system is not simply being spoken of as a means to generate income, but as showing us which families matter and which don't. Marriage, experienced as a personal choice, is being politically determined. What do our private living arrangements have to do with the government? More and more; for as Steve Hilton departs, one can see he embodied the moral relativism of an arch-Thatcherite. Morality is to be preached to the poor, who must be punished if they fail. But if you can pay for it, you can do what you damn well please. Look at Boris and Zac and the rest of them. Family values? On your bike! Still, ad nauseam we hear that if only those at the bottom understood the value of hard work, aspiration and passing on an inheritance from father to son, all would be lovely. This is being told to those currently without work or with little chance of owning property, it is being told to women who are struggling to bring up children on their own. All while the gang of four fiddle at the edges of the economy, refusing to see what is deeply undermining of \"family values\": the incessant thrust of the market to push wages down and consumption up. I don't buy \"family values\" at all, for the cost is being paid by those who can least afford it.",

It's good to have it spelled out sometimes and, right now, the group of men who rule over us are doing so fairly clearly. Funny to think that what used to be a somewhat controversial view unless you were <em>au fait</em> with Engels \u2013 that modern family structure is little to do with love or romance but simply about guaranteeing paternity and the passing on of property via inheritance \u2013 is now openly articulated by the right. Not so much the love-and-romance bit \u2013 they aren't fools \u2013 but certainly the view is everywhere that the job of government is to keep the system in place by propping up marriage. So are weddings.</p> <p>Modern conservatives, by which I mean politicians of all parties, don't identify such social engineering as vulgar Marxism any more. No, this is \"family values\". Everyone cares enormously about families; well, some families. Ones who have done the right thing and got themselves a \u00a32m house to live in. Why should they pay more tax? We're talking here about 74,000 people. A new oppressed minority.</p> <p>What about the men who go out and earn an OK wage, but are married to \"stay-at-home mums\" and will now lose child benefit. Poor things. Except they are not poor. What about gay people getting married? This will clearly up the divorce rate of the happy heterosexuals because there is nothing like a Big Fat Gay Wedding with, say, a reading from Rachel Cusk to make couples disintegrate on the spot. I had not put all these Tory proposals together&#xa0;until the Daily Telegraph did. They have a unifying theme, according to an editorial that said: \"They all risk undermining the traditional family.\"</p> <p>When I see a picture of Cameron, Osborne, Clegg and Alexander sitting around a table plotting, I don't see much undermining of anything except that old adage \"women and children first\". I do think, when I see them squabbling about tax, that ties should be taxed. I acknowledge, though, that's a quick fix. I also see the slashing of public-sector jobs, changes to legal aid, the closing of refuges, the stigmatising of single parents (rarely described as \"stay-at-home mums\"), all being done in the name of&#xa0;financial necessity, though driven by a core belief. While the government professes to a minimal state agenda, these are highly interventionist and gendered policies.</p> <p>Some Tories are fairly upfront about it. Others claim not to notice, but the conservative nostalgia that wants to push women back into the home depends on a supply of stable partners with stable jobs. There is a good bit of work to be done on that front. This political fantasy: that we can somehow return to previous levels of growth that will provide good men with good jobs sustains the family-values brigade.</p> <p>Whatever optimism there is about recovery, Vince Cable's anxiety about a lack of \"compelling vision\" is telling. The government is split now over taxation because this is pitting present wealth against possible future wealth. They don't want to tax aspiration. Who would, they ask. Me, actually, as it's another bit of political ad-speak. Most people aspire to get by. Many people aspire to a family holiday or to not have to get in debt if their boiler breaks. Those who aspire to enormous riches will always have a go if they think they are hard enough.</p> <p>Aspiration, though, is also being redefined. If cuts in child benefits penalise \"stay-at-home mums\", as we were told, what are women meant to aspire to? Dual-income families are seen as undermining \"the traditional family\" rather than being part of modern life's rich tapestry. So I guess single parents are undermining the ideal even more. Auberon Waugh once wrote that the children of divorced parents should simply be put to death. I actually prefer this extreme Swiftian logic to the coalition's remorseless \"caring\".</p> <p>Inevitably, the effects of austerity are felt by all kinds of families, mostly economically. But currently the tax system is not simply being spoken of as a means to generate income, but as showing us which families matter and which don't. Marriage, experienced as a personal choice, is being politically determined. What do our private living arrangements have to do with the government? More and more; for as Steve Hilton departs, one can see he embodied the moral relativism of an arch-Thatcherite. Morality is to be preached to the poor, who must be punished if they fail. But if you can pay for it, you can do what you damn well please. Look at Boris and Zac and the rest of them. Family values? On your bike!</p> <p>Still, ad nauseam we hear that if only those at the bottom understood the value of hard work, aspiration and passing on an inheritance from father to son, all would be lovely. This is being told to those currently without work or with little chance of owning property, it is being told to women who are struggling to bring up children on their own. All while the gang of four fiddle at the edges of the economy, refusing to see what <em>is</em>&#xa0;deeply undermining of \"family values\": the incessant thrust of the market to push wages down and consumption up. I don't buy \"family values\" at all, for the cost is being paid by those who can least afford it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Self-immolation has become one of the most powerful forms of individual protest in a globalised age. Three Tibetans have set themselves alight in the past week: an 18-year-old man, a mother of four and a teenage girl. More than 20 have made this viscerally shocking public statement in the past year in protest against the Chinese government's treatment of Tibetan culture and religion. No wonder the Chinese have stepped up security. Self-immolation can spark revolution. When philosophy student Jan Palach poured petrol on himself and lit a match in Prague after Soviet tanks had rolled into Czechoslovakia, his death brought hundreds of thousands on to the streets. Tunisian market trader Mohamed Bouazizi probably never imagined that by setting himself alight in December 2010 he would spark protests that escalated into the Arab Spring. Thich Quang Duc, an elderly Buddhist monk who set himself alight in the lotus position in Saigon in 1963, was the first globalised self-immolation. Some argue that this act, regarded as a sacrifice of great selflessness in some Chinese Buddhist scripture, was inspired by religious antecedents. Most of the 3,000 acts of self-immolation since have occurred in countries with Buddhist or Hindu traditions, as sociologist Michael Biggs records in his book Making Sense of Suicide Missions. Many who self-immolate are monks but they do not generally believe, like cult followers who die together, that their suicide heralds a more exulted existence. The dominant interpretation placed on Quang Duc's death, which was widely reported in America (Malcolm Browne's famous photograph is the cover image of Rage Against the Machine's debut album), was that it was directed against the South Vietnamese dictatorship. This view has since encouraged clusters of self-immolations: Indian students in 1990, Kurds in Turkey, Falung Gong followers in China and even Americans protesting against Vietnam. Self-immolation makes authorities \u2013 both democratic and totalitarian \u2013 nervous. The self-immolation of Graham Bamford, who set himself on fire outside Parliament in 1993 over Britain's failure to halt atrocities in the Balkans, received little coverage at the time. To some, death by fire is the ultimate negation of individual agency, a futile act of aggression against the self. But self-immolation inspires in others a belief that individual suffering can set in motion changes far greater than one horrifying death.",

      "bodyText": "Wednesday's iPad 3 launch had a wider purpose than introducing an upgraded tablet. It was Apple's most coherent effort yet to bind its family of screens closer together, in a way that prepares the ground for the world's largest technology company to disrupt the world's most important entertainment medium \u2013 broadcasting. Tim Cook introduced his concept of the \"post PC era\". With growing numbers of tablet computers and smartphones, the humble desktop computer is no longer the centre of our digital world. All our screens have become computers, and that revolution is coming to the television set. A quarter of TV sets being sold today have an internet connection. Apple has yet to reveal a TV set of its own, contenting itself with an upgrade to its set top box, known as Apple TV, which has been on sale for some years now but hooks up to your existing screen rather than an Apple made display. Some of the improvements to Apple TV and the iPad3 are about preparing for that event. First of these is high definition. Real HD sets have 1080 lines of vertical resolution. Apple TV's resolution has been improved, from 720p to 1080p. The iPad 3 will be able to take 1080p video and photos. The second is an expansion of the iCloud media storage service. This holds any content purchased from iTunes, or uploaded from your PC, in Apple's servers. The advantage is that your library of photos, videos and music are available on any Apple device, from phones to the television set. The service already stores photos, TV shows and music. From today it will also store movies bought on the iTunes store. Another binding technology we already know about is AirPlay, included in Apple's latest operating systems. This streams images from a phone, PC or a tablet onto a TV set. The Apple devices are increasingly able to produce and share high definition content, the kind of material that looks good on the biggest screen in the living room. Apple TV is a rare misfire: it came to market in 2007 and has sold just over 4m units. Paltry compared with 55m iPads in two years. After its latest upgrade, Apple TV can now be seen as a sleeper device, a hint of its maker's vision for the reinvention of broadcasting, and a test bed for bigger things to come.",

      "body": "<p>Wednesday's iPad 3 launch had a wider purpose than introducing an upgraded tablet. It was Apple's most coherent effort yet to bind its family of screens closer together, in a way that prepares the ground for the world's largest technology company to disrupt the world's most important entertainment medium \u2013 broadcasting.</p> <p>Tim Cook introduced his concept of the \"post PC era\". With growing numbers of tablet computers and smartphones, the humble desktop computer is no longer the centre of our digital world. All our screens have become computers, and that revolution is coming to the television set.</p> <p>A quarter of TV sets being sold today have an internet connection. Apple has yet to reveal a TV set of its own, contenting itself with an upgrade to its set top box, known as Apple TV, which has been on sale for some years now but hooks up to your existing screen rather than an Apple made display.</p> <p>Some of the improvements to Apple TV and the iPad3 are about preparing for that event.</p> <p>First of these is high definition. Real HD sets have 1080 lines of vertical resolution. Apple TV's resolution has been improved, from 720p to 1080p. The iPad 3 will be able to take 1080p video and photos.</p> <p>The second is an expansion of the iCloud media storage service. This holds any content purchased from iTunes, or uploaded from your PC, in Apple's servers. The advantage is that your library of photos, videos and music are available on any Apple device, from phones to the television set.</p> <p>The service already stores photos, TV shows and music. From today it will also store movies bought on the iTunes store.</p> <p>Another binding technology we already know about is AirPlay, included in Apple's latest operating systems. This streams images from a phone, PC or a tablet onto a TV set.</p> <p>The Apple devices are increasingly able to produce and share high definition content, the kind of material that looks good on the biggest screen in the living room.</p> <p>Apple TV is a rare misfire: it came to market in 2007 and has sold just over 4m units. Paltry compared with 55m iPads in two years. After its latest upgrade, Apple TV can now be seen as a sleeper device, a hint of its maker's vision for the reinvention of broadcasting, and a test bed for bigger things to come.</p>",

      "bodyText": "France have taken the guillotine to both their starting half-backs, Morgan Parra and Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc, ahead of Sunday's key Six Nations game against England in Paris. Julien Dupuy, formerly of Leicester, and Lionel Beauxis will now line up against the English, a clear sign of French discontent following the 17-all draw against Ireland last time out. The home side can still win the title but their failure to profit from ample forward possession has persuaded Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 to make a highly significant reshuffle. While Dimitri Yachvili is fit again and enjoyed an outstanding game for Biarritz last weekend, he has been overlooked in favour of Dupuy, whose last Test start was in 2009. Saint-Andr\u00e9 is also looking for Beauxis to release his backline more effectively than Trinh-Duc did. \"The important thing is to make sure you don't make the same mistake a second time,\" Saint-Andr\u00e9 said. \"What was incredible against Ireland was how we dominated the possession, the set piece, the penalties, the line breaks and the tackles. But dominating is not winning.\" Dupuy, who received a 23-week ban in 2010 for eye-gouging Ulster's Stephen Ferris, is delighted to be back. \"I know the English well, I'm really pleased to be playing against them,\" he said. \"I will be all the more pleased to meet their Leicester players after our victory.\" His lengthy suspension has also concentrated his mind. \"It's over. I made a gesture I should not have done and I was punished for it, period. It's like ages [ago] to me. I am more mature, I spent three years without France. But playing for France has always been a goal.\" Saint-Andr\u00e9 has otherwise retained the same starting XV, keeping faith with the centre Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie. Julien Bonnaire continues at openside, with Imanol Harinordoquy at No8, and Louis Picamoles among the replacements. \"We can still win the tournament,\" Saint-Andr\u00e9 said. \"We will get together to produce a big performance against England and then think about the following match after that. We will look to be a bit more tactically astute.\" Ireland have a new captain for their game against Scotland in the shape of the hooker Rory Best, whose brother Simon led the national team in 2007 before retiring a year later because of an irregular heartbeat. The younger Best, who will also be equalling Keith Wood's record as Ireland's most capped hooker when he wins his 58th on Saturday, replaces the injured Paul O'Connell, with Eoin Reddan coming in for the sidelined Conor Murray at scrum-half. Keith Earls (groin), Donncha O'Callaghan (ankle), Sean O'Brien (foot) and Jonathan Sexton (foot) were all unable to train on Wednesday. The wing Mirco Bergamasco will make his first appearance for Italy since the World Cup when he starts against Wales in Cardiff on Saturday. Jacques Brunel has made seven changes to the side defeated by Ireland, with Bergamasco set to regain the kicking duties after recovering from a shoulder injury. There is also a change at scrum-half, with Fabio Semenzato replacing the injured Edoardo Gori, and Kristopher Burton is restored at fly-half ahead of Tobias Botes, who drops to the bench. Cornelius Van Zyl replaces Marco Bortolami in the second row, while Simone Favaro comes in for Roberto Barbieri at flanker. France (v England, Sunday): C Poitrenaud (Toulouse), V Clerc (Toulouse), A Rougerie, W Fofana, J Malzieu (all Clermont Auvergne); L Beauxis (Toulouse), J Dupuy (Stade Fran\u00e7ais); JB Poux (Toulouse), D Szarzewski (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), N Mas (Perpignan), P Pap\u00e9 (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), Y Maestri (Toulouse), T Dusautoir (Toulouse, capt), J Bonnaire (Clermont), I Harinordoquy (Biarritz).

      "bodyText": "Apple has stepped up its assault on the tablet computer market with a string of new features for the iPad. The next-generation iPad will feature a high-definition retina display \u2013 which Apple said boasts more pixels than a high-definition TV \u2013 and an improved camera, dubbed \"iSight\". The slightly heaver device will feature improved photo and video taking, with a greater resolution camera and an HD video recorder. It will be able to connect to high-speed 4G networks and run an Apple-built A5X processing chip. The technology giant heaped pressure on its rivals with a cheaper iPad 2 priced at $399 (\u00a3254). Apple also increased its presence in the living room with an enhanced set-top box, Apple TV. At a launch event in San Francisco on Wednesday, Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, described the iPad as \"the poster-child of the post-PC world\". He claimed that rivals launched more than 100 copycat tablet computers last year alone. \"The iPad is about post-portable computing. And it's outstripping the wildest of predictions,\" Cook said. \"We think the iPad is the poster child of the post-PC world. The momentum behind iPad has been incredible and has surprised virtually everyone. Across the year you're going to see a lot more of this innovation \u2013 we are just getting started.\" Phil Schiller, Apple's vice-president of global marketing, said: \"This is the best mobile display that has ever shipped and it's a real revolution.\" Apple held back from announcing a branded TV set, but film fans will be able to play high-definition content for the first time, with Apple TV. The new Apple TV will cost $99 (\u00a362), the same as the previous version. Movie fans will be able to wirelessly store films on multiple devices with Apple's improved iCloud storage system. Cook, who took over from Steve Jobs in August last year, said that Apple sold 172m \"post-PC\" devices in 2011, accounting for 76% of its total revenue in the final quarter of that year. The announcements fell short of what some commentators were expecting from the technology giant, which is the world's most valuable company by market capitalisation. \"Apple has so far played the TV game half-heartedly,\" said industry analyst Mark Mulligan. \"If Apple gets it right it can transform the internet experience in the living room and make the first bold step to removing the distinction between the TV experience and the internet.\" The nascent internet TV market is expected to have more than 61m users worldwide by the end of 2012, according to research firm Gartner. New releases from Apple and other electronics firms will grow that market to 82m subscribers by 2014, generating $27.3m in revenue. The new version of the iPad will cement Apple's position in the fast-growing market still further, according to Salman Chaudhry, mobile computing analyst at IT research firm Context. \"Despite strong showings from Samsung, with Apple accounting for 89% of the market in western Europe, we expect this dominance to remain following the new iPad launch,\" he said. \"Competitor tablets have failed to launch with a unique selling point. The biggest threat we see to the iPad comes from Amazon, with the upcoming Kindle Fire's low price point reinforcing a trend towards a two-tier industry: sleek, well-designed premium tablets on one side and cheaper tablets on the other.\" Apple sold 15m iPads in the final quarter of last year, 58% of the total market and more than double the number it sold in the same period in 2010, according to the latest research from Strategy Analytics. Google Android tablets made up 39% of the rest of the market in the four months to December last year. Carolina Milanesi, smartphones and tablets analyst for the research company Gartner, forecasts total tablet sales will hit 118m sales barrier this year, making it almost a quarter of the size of the PC market, whose growth is slowing rapidly. Sales are also shrinking in north America and Europe. Last year the worldwide PC market was under 360m, and growth is expected to be slow this year too despite the launch in autumn of Microsoft's next version of Windows. \"We see it as Apple, and then a long way back Samsung and Amazon, and then other companies are selling thousands rather than millions,\" Milanesi said. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2012.

      "bodyText": "Beijing has dismissed Tibetans, young and old, who have set themselves on fire in protest against Chinese rule as criminals or suspicious people with a \"very bad reputation\". Despite extensive security, the government has failed to stop self-immolations, which have attracted attention and sympathy across the world. More than 20 monks, nuns, former clergy and ordinary people \u2013 including three in the last five days \u2013 have set themselves on fire in the past year, mostly in Aba county in south-western Sichuan province. \"Some of the suicides are committed by clerics returning to lay life, and they all have criminal records or suspicious activities. They have a very bad reputation in society,\" said Wu Zegang, China's top official in Aba. Authorities have sealed off Aba, making it impossible to verify details of the cases. Officials have suggested the acts were linked to personal issues, most recently claiming that a 20-year-old woman who set fire to herself in Gansu province on Saturday had lost \"her courage for life and study\" when her school performance suffered, after she hit her head on a radiator. Wu said those who had set themselves on fire in Aba had shouted pro-independence slogans beforehand. He cited it as evidence that the self-immolations were \"orchestrated and supported\" by Dalai Lama and Tibetan independence forces. The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India, has praised the courage of those who engage in self-immolation but has said he does not encourage the protests. He blames Chinese repression of Tibetan culture and religion for the cases. \"I think China miscalculated in the late 90s, by exporting to eastern Tibetan areas aggressive anti-Dalai Lama policies they had been imposing for years in central Tibetan areas,\" said Professor Robert Barnett, an expert on Tibet at Columbia University. \"Since people began to protest the policy has been more hardline.\" The recent outbreakspate of self-immolations began with the death of Phuntsog, a young monk from Kirti monastery, last March. The response of authorities \u2014 surrounding the monastery and later sentencing monks including his brother and uncle for involvement with his death \u2014 appeared to exacerbate tensions. Stephanie Brigden of Free Tibet said it was ludicrous to describe those who had self-immolated as criminals. She said it reflected the officials' anxiety over failure to stop the burnings. \"In the last few months we have seen lots of efforts by China to criminalise them and even use the language of terrorism. I think it's a result of the pressure China feels internally as well as externally. \"Local leaders have been told to maintain social stability; they know it is not within their capacity so their only strategy is to use rhetoric that criminalises people. They have responded with force and it's not worked.\" Barnett says officials appear to be in an intellectual quandary with their Tibet policy, responding to complaints of excessive state interference with more interference. The increasing reach of officials into monastery life is underlined by a new \"six ones\" policy for officials in new temple management committees being set up in the Tibet autonomous region. The six instructions include becoming close friends with at least one monk or nun and handling one problem so their families feel the warmth of the party and the government \u2013 but, at the same time, also building one file on each of them. \"China's strategy over the last 30 years of winning Tibetans over through generosity is running so closely to its other strategy of intimidating people who do not have the right views,\" said Barnett. Meanwhile, leaders from north-western Xinjiang region, which has experienced ethnic violence, vowed to attack what the Communist party secretary Zhang Chunxian called \"rotten eggs and bad elements\" in a briefing on Wednesday. \"When an event occurs, we resolutely smash it. When an incident occurs, we also smash it,\" he had said.",

      "bodyText": "Our mother, Raymonde (Ray) Hainton, who has died aged 90, was a peace activist, Quaker and former teacher and medical social worker. She was born in Stanmore, Middlesex, the daughter of Frank Try and his wife Lena, who was determined that her clever daughter should receive an academic education. Ray won scholarships to Bishopshalt school, in Hillingdon, west London, and to Bedford College, University of London, where she read history, and through her wartime evacuation to Cambridge met and married fellow historian Godfrey Hainton. Ray's student vacations included service with the Land Army and in the bomb shelters of the East End of London. Her first teaching post was at Roedean school, evacuated to Keswick. After the war, the couple settled in Cheltenham, where their two daughters were born. Ray's wartime experiences motivated her to campaign for a better world. She and Godfrey worked for the Common Wealth party, then founded the Cheltenham Fabian Society. When Godfrey's teaching career took them to London, Ray launched the Hounslow United Nations Association. In 1960 she retrained as a medical social worker, and began a rewarding second career at Ashford hospital, Middlesex. After Godfrey's college moved down to Plymouth, Ray took up a new post at a children's assessment unit. She had become a Quaker in 1969 and helped establish a new Quaker meeting in Tavistock. Godfrey's sudden death in 1976 was a shattering blow. Ray pulled her life together by writing up his research on Derwent Coleridge, second son of the poet, and their joint book, The Unknown Coleridge, was eventually published in 1996. While attending a Quaker disarmament conference in 1980, Ray first became aware of the horror of nuclear weapons. She founded the Tavistock Peace Action Group and, on moving to Exeter in 1986, became secretary of Exeter CND. Over the following years Ray helped build one of the largest CND branches in Britain, joined the CND international committee, and travelled to the Soviet Union and Cuba in people-to-people exchanges intended to undermine the iron curtain. She also made links with the French anti-nuclear movement and lobbied for disarmament in New York. She was a vigorous speaker and street campaigner, working tirelessly through schools, the media and the Exeter Peace Shop. Her arrest at the Aldermaston blockade in 2000 generated huge local publicity. Ray loved the outdoors. She was a keen gardener and walker, exploring Dartmoor and swimming in the sea until well into her 80s. She was also a fond mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. In 2008 she moved to live near her younger daughter in Northampton, remaining a relentless peace campaigner until the end. She is survived by us and by six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.",

      "bodyText": "Government plans for saving \u00a3350m a year in legal aid expenses suffered fresh defeats in the House of Lords after peers overturned a series of cost-saving proposals. Peers voted by 237 to 198 to preserve legal aid for appeals against welfare benefit decisions, defeating reforms proposed in the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders bill. The amendment had been tabled by the Liberal Democrat Lady Doocey with support from Labour, Conservative and crossbench peers. A second amendment, tabled by the Lord Newton, the former social security minister under Margaret Thatcher, ensured that legal aid should be available for higher-tier benefit appeals was also passed. The votes came at the end of a two-hour debate during which every single speaker in the upper chamber \u2013 apart from the minister \u2013 opposed the Ministry of Justice plans. Peers from all parties questioned whether the proposed savings would be made. Earlier Lord McNally, the Liberal Democrat justice minister, warned that if the government lost on the issue of providing legal aid on welfare benefit issues and support for advice centres it would \"tear out the heart of the rationale of the bill\". The defeats will add to the pressure on the government's parliamentary timetable. The coalition is expected to try and reverse the Lords' decisions in the House of Commons on the grounds that the bill is primarily a financial measure. Proposing her amendment, Doocey said: \"If claimants are denied legal aid, their situation will get worse. This amendment would allow some of the most vulnerable people in society to fight for the benefits for which they are entitled.\" Not-for-profit advice centres that help the most vulnerable in society would lose \u00a351m a year under the cuts introduced by the bill, she warned. Lord Newton cautioned that: \"This process of change in legal aid is not taking place in a vacuum. It's during turbulence in the benefit system.\" More than 1 million people were likely to be adversely affected by changes to benefit under the welfare reform bill, he said. \"If I was still an MP I would be a bit worried. That's 2,000 people per constituency and they will all have relatives \u2026 and many others will be upset. \"There are a lot of people in this country to whom \u00a310 or \u00a320 a week makes a big difference as to whether they can heat [their homes] or eat. No one actually believes that the savings claimed by the government will be realised.\" Advice centres will lose funding despite government promises of support, Lord Newton added. \"I would not want to back off this amendment on the vague promise that something might be done in future.\" The Liberal Democrat Lord Carlile asked: \"At the end of the day are we going to make any savings in legal aid if people have to present their own cases or they end up in the hands of the mental health services? It's very likely there will be a negative impact in public funding.\" Lord Goldsmith, the former Labour attorney general, said the damage inflicted on advice centres would be far-reaching. \"The funding for the not-for-profit centres will be cut by 77%. The advice services alliance estimates that 800 specialist advice centres will lost as a result. The welfare benefits side requires an expertise which most lawyers don't have.\" The government may be targeting so-called \"fat cat lawyers\", Lord Goldsmith noted, \"but no cat gets fat on welfare law\". Lord Bach, the Labour justice spokesman in the Lords, said: \"There is [now] access to justice for everyone, including the poor and the marginalised. We have a system that is both practical and principled. It's not perfect but it works. This bill will decimate it: 650,000 people who have access to justice will not have it any longer. \"It verges on being unconstitutional because it reduces access to justice. It will not save costs further down the line. If we do this we will be making our country a less civilised place.\" McNally insisted: \"The government is committed to ensuring that not-for-profit advice remains to provide claimants with means of how they can seek redress. It's not the case that legal aid is required in all cases.\" A forthcoming review by the Cabinet Office will \"secure the long-term sustainability of the not-for-profit advice sector\" through additional funding, he added. The opposition had painted \"doomsday scenarios\", MacNally said. \"We have to take tough decisions in tough times. You lose control your economy you go into another round of cuts.\" The Labour opposition would also have had to make similar cuts, he noted. Commenting on the vote to retain legal aid for welfare benefit appeals, the shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, said: \"This victory provides a vital safety net for the poorest in our society. It ensures that when bureaucrats make a mistake that denies support such as disability benefits to the vulnerable and their families, then they will have expert advice in making an appeal. \"According to Citizens Advice, every \u00a31 of taxpayer money spent on legal aid in benefit cases saves the state up to \u00a38.80 down the line. \"So, regardless of the Government's spin, today's vote is also about saving the taxpayer money through early stage intervention, of the kind that prevents problems escalating, reducing the call on resources in future months and years.\" Richard Hawkes, chief executive of the disability charity Scope, said: \"Thousands of disabled people and their families will be delighted at the action taken by Peers in the House of Lords today. \"The Lords have recognised that to cut legal aid at a time of unprecedented changes to welfare support would have meant disabled people who fall foul of poor decision-making, red tape or administrative error would have been pushed even further into poverty as they struggled to manoeuvre the complicated legal system without the necessary expert support they need. \"The result would have been a ticking time bomb of poorly prepared and lengthy tribunals and appeals, choking the courts and not saving money as suggested by Ken Clarke, but actually costing the Government far more in the long term.\"",

It ensures that when bureaucrats make a mistake that denies support such as disability benefits to the vulnerable and their families, then they will have expert advice in making an appeal.</p> <p>\"According to Citizens Advice, every \u00a31 of taxpayer money spent on legal aid in benefit cases saves the state up to \u00a38.80 down the line.</p> <p>\"So, regardless of the Government's spin, today's vote is also about saving the taxpayer money through early stage intervention, of the kind that prevents problems escalating, reducing the call on resources in future months and years.\"</p> <p>Richard Hawkes, chief executive of the disability charity Scope, said: \"Thousands of disabled people and their families will be delighted at the action taken by Peers in the House of Lords today.</p> <p>\"The Lords have recognised that to cut legal aid at a time of unprecedented changes to welfare support would have meant disabled people who fall foul of poor decision-making, red tape or administrative error would have been pushed even further into poverty as they struggled to manoeuvre the complicated legal system without the necessary expert support they need.</p> <p>\"The result would have been a ticking time bomb of poorly prepared and lengthy tribunals and appeals, choking the courts and not saving money as suggested by Ken Clarke, but actually costing the Government far more in the long term.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Blink and you'd miss Cottage Grove, the tiny town, population 85, set in the rolling hills of west Tennessee. This rural community was known as Todd Town after a local farming family until the late 1850s, when its first postmaster arrived and renamed the village. Now locals fear the service that created their identity 160-odd years ago is about to destroy it. Cottage Grove's story is being played out across America. The debt-riddled US Postal Service (USPS) is threatening to close 3,200 post offices, including this one. Closures are set for May, so letters of notice could start going out this month. Eventually, some fear, USPS has its eye on 15,000 closures, about half the network. The USPS's army of critics blame declining mail volumes, the internet and soaring costs for the catastrophe. \"The rise of email and online bill-paying, competition from private delivery companies like FedEx and UPS and the recession of 2007-09 have hit the USPS hard,\" the libertarian Cato Institute reported last year. Mail volume declined by 35bn pieces (about 17%) from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2009. Even America's postmaster general, Patrick Donahoe, agrees. \"While some of the decline is attributable to economic weakness since 2007,\" Donahoe said recently, \"the more significant factor is the continuing transition to electronic alternatives.\" In 2000, 5% of Americans paid their bills online; now 60% do. According to the post office's defenders, however, the real culprit is not the internet but USPS's mismanagement and a combination of political hostility and incompetence. Whatever the truth, it is hitting the service hard. Last month USPS announced the closure of 260 mail processing centres, with the loss of 35,000 jobs. In the last four years 140,000 positions have been lost from the postal service, the second-largest civil employer in the US behind Walmart with 571,000 employees. Cottage Grove is bucolic in the spring light. A dog stretches in the middle of Church Street; clouds scud across clear blue skies. \"We call this bragging weather,\" said Mike Waddey, Cottage Grove's Southern Baptist minister and the man co-ordinating the fight against the post office's closure. When he moved to Cottage Grove in 2004, Waddey, his wife and six children upped the population by 6%. Now they make up an even larger percentage. The local shop closed three years ago, and the bank is open only two days a week. If the post office closes, Waddey will be the last man in the village with a full-time job. The USPS may have based its decision on Cottage Grove's declining numbers, but its post office serves a wider community \u2013 420 people in the surrounding area use the post office's boxes. More than 100 turned out for a meeting in the baptist church last October, at which a post office spokeswoman listened to locals and said their comments would be studied. Four days later, they got a standard letter saying their concerns had been heard. \"I find it hard to believe they studied that hard,\" said Waddey. It's a common feeling across huge tracts of the US. Nearly 80% of the post offices marked for closure are in rural communities like this one. There is no doubting the size of the post office's problems. In February, chief financial officer Joe Corbett warned it would run out of cash in October. USPS ended the last fiscal year with a loss of $5.1bn (\u00a33.2bn). Steve Hutkins, a New York University literature professor who runs the Savethepostoffice.com blog, points out that the vast majority of USPS's losses are due to an accounting rule imposed on the service in 2006. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) required the postal service to pay about $5.6bn a year over 10 years into a fund to cover retiree healthcare. USPS easily made the first year's payments, then the recession bit and it could not keep up with the payments. As the US recovers from recession, the decline in volumes has slowed. In the last quarter USPS had an operating income of $200m and the pace of decline had slowed to 1.1%, down from 2% in 2010-2011. But any thought of profit was wiped out by the $3.1bn USPS owed to its retiree healthcare fund, a double payment as it had failed to make the previous instalment. Strangely, it is not that the fund is short of cash. The post office has $44bn in the health fund, part of $326bn it holds in pension and other benefits funds. According to Hutkins, political in-fighting is also holding back the search for a solution to the crisis. \"The post office has always been a political football,\" he said. Union bashers and private enterprise advocates hate the USPS. Even within the service there is ambivalence about its role as a service, he said. \"The internet was not the poison and it's not the cure,\" said Waddey, standing inside Cottage Grove's modern, red-brick post office. The building was rebuilt in 1999 and the post office leases the building from Cottage Grove. It will still be paying $3,000 a month rent on it for seven years even if it closes. Inside the post office is a small lending library that locals have set up. It's busy, by Cottage Grove standards, and clearly the hub of the town. Carolyn Kaminski, city recorder, who is there to pick up mail, said she works part-time for the city, one of three part-time jobs she has. The closure will add a 20-mile drive to her routine to collect the post. \"People say you can adjust, you can do this, you can do that. But we depend on this post office. It really is the hub of this community,\" she said. \"It's crazy that it has come to this. Someone needs their butt kicking.\"",

      "bodyText": "It's partly a question, says John Caudwell, of what you'd want to see on your tombstone. \"Here Lies a Very Successful Businessman,\" he says. \"Doesn't really do it, that, does it? Not quite enough, somehow. You'd want something more.\" Not that he's in any way ashamed of being a Very Successful Businessman, which he undeniably is: Caudwell's fortune, amassed largely in various parts of the mobile phone business (he founded Phones4U), is estimated at more than \u00a31.5bn. \"No, I feel I've made a big contribution,\" the 58-year-old says. \"I've paid a lot of tax. I've created something like 20,000 jobs. I certainly don't feel guilty.\" But still, you know, something felt like it was missing. \"Business gives you a massive high,\" Caudwell says. \"Doing a great deal, coming up with an inspirational solution \u2026 It's very addictive. But it doesn't last long. In isolation, it's a bit sterile. It doesn't reward the soul.\" Caudwell knows, though, an eight-year-old girl who has Type II spinal muscular atrophy. \"We've been helping her since she was two,\" he says. \"Mainly special wheelchairs, to keep her spine upright. It's brought her a massive amount of independence. You should see the difference. Now that's a reward. That's a fantastic reward. A totally different reward.\" So Caudwell is now giving much of his fortune away. He gives mainly to disabled children through own foundation, Caudwell Children, and others. That's not because he feels he didn't deserve to make a great deal of money (\"I worked phenomenally hard, sacrificed what most people call a normal life\"), but because he feels lucky to have been born able to. \"I channel my giving to people who weren't born lucky,\" he says. \"I'm a capitalist. I'm not going to feel sympathetic to people leading a life they don't have to lead; who with effort could maybe break out of it. OK, I've made a preposterous amount of money. But I was born with the attributes needed to do it. That's the point.\" Nor does Caudwell feel he should have paid more tax, in order \u2013 perhaps \u2013 to fund a society where such generosity wasn't necessary. \"Taxes aren't the way to go,\" he says. \"They'd strangle the economy; you wouldn't create the wealth. And nothing squanders money as well as a government. What we need is to encourage rich people to give.\" How do we feel about that? Sceptical, perhaps. We are not, on the whole, very comfortable in Britain, especially on the left, with large-scale giving by extremely wealthy individuals. We haven't been since the torrents of philanthropic Victorian cash that flowed \u2013 not always to very great effect \u2013 from rich to poor in the 19th century. Giving in the UK stands at around 1% of GDP, roughly half the US level (though the comparison is skewed by the fact that nearly a third of US giving is to religious organisations). But in the US, philanthropy is institutionalised: wealthy Americans routinely give 3.5% of their investable assets to charity (against 0.5-0.8% for their British counterparts) and have a public \"duty\" to give. Here, it has generally been a private affair: not done to blow your own trumpet. \"It's cultural,\" says Beth Breeze of the centre for philanthropy, humanitarianism and social justice at the University of Kent. \"The tax differences aren't enormous. Partly, it's because the US is better at asking. But in America, every Harvard graduate thinks: who's going to be the first in my year to have a building named after him? In New York, you haven't made it if you're not on the board of a major arts institution like the Met.\" There are big givers in Britain, certainly: the Coutts Million Pound Donor Report identifies 174 donations of \u00a31m or more in 2010, worth \u00a31.3bn. (This was down from \u00a31.6bn in 2006, but since the Sunday Times Rich List reported an 11.5% fall in donations by its major charitable givers last year \u2013 coinciding with a 37% fall in their wealth due to the recession \u2013 the general view is that philanthropy, under the circumstances, is holding up well.) But there's another angle to this very British reticence towards philanthropy, says Breeze, and as a left-leaning academic, it annoys her: \"It seems to be OK to be a local giver, raise money for charity, give a bit to Comic Relief. But as soon as you add a few zeroes, people start thinking: something's up. What's in it for them?\" So press coverage of big givers \u2013 especially the Guardian \u2013 can be negative, even snide. There are unspoken inferences and unasked questions, suggests Breeze. \"How did these people get their money? Did they really earn it? Did they make it by exploitation? Or in something somehow shabby, like 'the man who introduced shellsuits to Britain', the 'curry king' or 'fake-tan queen'. Should they really have it at all? And this idea that people only really give to look good \u2026 Or to somehow 'redeem themselves'.\" Which is sad, reckons Breeze, because such attitudes do form \"a barrier to giving. People don't want to read that about themselves. And it's strange: we approve of charity, but disapprove of where the money comes from \u2013 rich individual donors.\" Her view is straightforward: \"Given we are where we are, do we want to cheer someone who does something to even out inequality, or discourage them?\" Merely by talking openly about his giving, then, John Caudwell is something of a novelty. But despite our jaundiced view, things are changing: TV programmes such as Channel 4's The Secret Millionaire have helped, and more multimillion pound donors such as Sir Tom Hunter (Sports Division) and Dame Stephanie \"Steve\" Shirley (FI Group) are not shy about publicising their philanthropy. This is a characteristic, say some, of The New Philanthropy, a term that emerged a decade or so ago following the sudden explosion of earnings in the City of London. Breeze dislikes the term new, arguing that philanthropy has always evolved and adapted to suit the age; look back, she says, and you'll find examples thoughout history of all that supposedly defines a New Philanthropist. But a 21st-century model of philanthropy, new or not, does exist, and several factors lie behind it, says Plum Lomax of New Philanthropy Capital, one of a number of institutions that now offer donors advice on their giving and are themselves part of the contemporary philanthropic scene. \"First, the past couple of decades have seen massive wealth creation; there's more money to give, even after the crisis,\" she says. \"And there's been a shift in the nature of that wealth: 15 years ago, 75% of the Sunday Times Rich List had inherited their wealth, and 25% were self-made. Those figures are now reversed.\" That has led to more people wanting to give more: surveys in the US show self-made money is three times as likely to be given away as inherited wealth. In the UK, the amount donated by the most generous givers on the Sunday Times Rich List increased tenfold, to \u00a33bn, between 2004 and 2009. There's something of a recent consensus, too, Lomax says, that for many wealthy individuals, \"giving while living\" is preferable \u2013 and certainly more fun \u2013 than endowing foundations in perpetuity. The \u00a315bn Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, is designed to spend down its capital within 50 years of the death of its last founder. Similarly, High Net Worth Individuals (as they're known) are increasingly tending, as the billionaire US investor Warren Buffett puts it, to the view that very rich people \"should leave their children enough money so that they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing\". (\"Paris Hilton,\" says Breeze drily, \"has done a great deal for philanthropy in recent years.\") Government, too, is taking philanthropy more seriously. Last year's budget included measures aimed at building a more philanthropic culture, and a Giving White Paper published in May declared the coalition's intention of making giving both \"easier\" and \"more compelling\", to achieve \"a step-change in giving\". One concrete move, which comes into effect this April, is the reduction in inheritance tax for people leaving at least 10% of their estate to charity from to 36%, from 40%. Roland Rudd, of the public relations firm Finsbury, has set up Legacy10 to encourage rather more of the population to leave money to charity than the current miserable 7%. \"For a wealthy individual, it's not a big ask, for a very real benefit,\" says Rudd of the initiative, backed by the leaders of the three big political parties and some well-known businessmen. Taken together, these trends prompt distinctive approaches to giving, Lomax argues. \"These people take an informed, planned, precisely targeted and hands-on approach to giving,\" she says. \"They care about maximising the impact their money can achieve. Some will invest substantial sums and take considerable risks on innovative ideas. This is strategic philanthropy.\" In fact, New Philanthropists treat their giving exactly as they treat their businesses and investments: their talk is of \"rigorous due diligence\", \"scalability\", \"return on capital\", \"leveraging the investment\", \"accountability to stakeholders\", \"agreed targets\", \"excellence in delivery\", \"accurately measured outcomes\". Some really push the parallels. The Impetus Trust, founded in 2002 by two City financiers with backgrounds in private equity and venture capital, takes the principles of those two sectors and applies them to philanthropy, calling the result \"venture philanthropy\". With a mission to \"break the cycle of poverty\", Impetus provides not just core grants to selected charities in its chosen fields, but follows up with sustained management support and pro bono specialist expertise, says Joanna Walker, a former investment banker and now the trust's director of philanthopy and partnerships. \"It's not about giving just money,\" Walker says. For every pound of \"seed money\" it gives, Impetus provides between \u00a33 and \u00a34 of practical support from both its in-house investment managers and external experts. \"It's a powerful model,\" she says. \"People can give more than money; they can give talent and experience. Corporate donors can involve staff. And if you haven't got time for that, you know your money will have a greater impact than on its own.\" Few embody the marriage of business and benefaction that characterises New Philanthropy better than famously fierce financier Chris Hohn and his wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn: he went so far as to set up a hedge fund, The Children's Investment Fund (TCI), in order to give a chunk of its profits to The Children's Investment Fund Foundation (Ciff), which she runs. Since 2006, that chunk has \u00a3956m. \"We wanted to publicly make the statement that if you're making these kinds of profits, getting these kinds of management fees, you should be doing more than writing a few cheques,\" says Cooper-Hohn. Many charities do a lot of work up to the point of making their donation, but Ciff's approach, she says, is \"to do as much, if not more, afterwards. It's an evidence-based approach to both the need, and the intervention.\" So Ciff is more than merely hands-on. It defines targets rigorously, monitors and evaluates progress early and often, \"and changes course, sometimes quite radically, if we're not on target. It's just like a business: constant assessment, constant course correction. Finding the algebraic equation that will get us to where we need to be.\" This remains a rarity in the charity sector, Cooper Hohn says: \"Management through to success somehow isn't seen as appropriate.\" And it can take time: \"You spend ages researching areas and find they're not right for what you want to achieve \u2013 but something else is. So, you want to improve literacy in a developing country, which means improving school attendance. Turns out the cheapest and most effective way to do that is deworming. But for deworming to work, it has to be national. And that takes time, drawing up a national programme with a government. But if you want a quality return, it has to be done.\" To meet the needs of the new breed of engaged philanthropist, a clutch of advisory institutions have emerged. The Institute for Philanthropy, headed by Kurt Hoffman, focuses on international donor education and network-building. New Philanthropy Capital helped Lombard Assurance founder John Stone work out what to do with the \u00a3100m-plus he wanted to give away. \"John and his wife Vanessa weren't particularly issue-focused,\" says NPC's Lena Baumgartner. \"He didn't know what an NGO was. So we drew up a list, and they chose a pilot portfolio of 10 charities. Very different, in water, girls' education, microfinance, in India, Africa, Asia. Over the next three years, they visited them all.\" Very quickly, Baumgartner says, a passion evolved, for water and sanitation, \"the root of so much\". Stone scaled up his giving from \u00a31m a year to \u00a35m and started to focus on those fields. NPC identified three countries \u2013 Tanzania, Cambodia, Zambia \u2013 where his money would do most good. It analysed organisations able to absorb \u00a31m over three years, and, after more visits from Stone, is now monitoring outcomes. \"It's unashamedly a businesslike approach,\" says Stone. \"NPC works like a stock-market analyst examining and tracking a sector ... I'm certainly trying to run my giving like a business, as far as possible. Some NGO people think we shouldn't, but really every principle is the same, bar the profit principle.\" The approach entails identifying promising startups capable of scaling up to become self-sustaining. \"That's key to the way I see things,\" Stone says. \"For me, the dream project is one where we become redundant.\" The Stone Family Foundation has now set up a Water Prize: risk capital for innovative, entrepreneurial, expandable projects in water aid. Stone's philanthropic work is now, he says, \"more satisfying and more fun for me than business. It also allows me to add more value. I really feel I'm using my money, my time and my talents well. I've become an evangelist.\" Are we right to be sniffy about this? Breeze believes not. \"Tax,\" she says, \"is compulsory. There's no joy in paying it. Philanthropy is about: This is my money, I can do what I like with it. It's people with surplus money wanting dreams, visions, opportunities. It's an identity question, what you feel your purpose in life is. And what kind of tax level would we need for there to be no room for extras? Even if the hospital's perfectly equipped, who'll pay to send the clowns into the children's ward? We should be cheering them.\"",

      "body": "<p>It's partly a question, says John Caudwell, of what you'd want to see on your tombstone. \"Here Lies a Very Successful Businessman,\" he says. \"Doesn't really do it, that, does it? Not quite enough, somehow. You'd want something more.\"</p> <p>Not that he's in any way ashamed of being a Very Successful Businessman, which he undeniably is: Caudwell's fortune, amassed largely in various parts of the mobile phone business (he founded Phones4U), is estimated at more than \u00a31.5bn.</p> <p>\"No, I feel I've made a big contribution,\" the 58-year-old says. \"I've paid a lot of tax. I've created something like 20,000 jobs. I certainly don't feel guilty.\" But still, you know, something felt like it was missing.</p> <p>\"Business gives you a massive high,\" Caudwell says. \"Doing a great deal, coming up with an inspirational solution \u2026 It's very addictive. But it doesn't last long. In isolation, it's a bit sterile. It doesn't reward the soul.\"</p> <p>Caudwell knows, though, an eight-year-old girl who has Type II spinal muscular atrophy. \"We've been helping her since she was two,\" he says. \"Mainly special wheelchairs, to keep her spine upright. It's brought her a massive amount of independence. You should see the difference. Now that's a reward. That's a fantastic reward. A totally different reward.\"</p> <p>So Caudwell is now giving much of his fortune away. He gives mainly to disabled children through own foundation, <a href=\"http://www.caudwellchildren.com/\" title=\"\">Caudwell Children</a>, and others. That's not because he feels he didn't deserve to make a great deal of money (\"I worked phenomenally hard, sacrificed what most people call a normal life\"), but because he feels lucky to have been born able to.</p> <p>\"I channel my giving to people who weren't born lucky,\" he says. \"I'm a capitalist. I'm not going to feel sympathetic to people leading a life they don't have to lead; who with effort could maybe break out of it. OK, I've made a preposterous amount of money. But I was born with the attributes needed to do it. That's the&#xa0;point.\"</p> <p>Nor does Caudwell feel he should have paid more tax, in order \u2013 perhaps \u2013 to fund a society where such generosity wasn't necessary. \"Taxes aren't the way to go,\" he says. \"They'd strangle the economy; you wouldn't create the wealth. And nothing squanders money as well as a government. What we need is to encourage rich people to give.\"</p> <p>How do we feel about that? Sceptical, perhaps. We are not, on the whole, very comfortable in Britain, especially on the left, with large-scale giving by extremely wealthy individuals. We haven't been since the torrents of philanthropic Victorian cash that flowed \u2013 not always to very great effect \u2013 from rich to poor in the 19th&#xa0;century.</p> <p>Giving in the UK stands at around 1% of GDP, roughly half the US level (though the comparison is skewed by the fact that nearly a third of US giving is to religious organisations). But in the US, philanthropy is institutionalised: wealthy Americans routinely give 3.5%&#xa0;of their investable assets to charity (against 0.5-0.8% for their British counterparts) and have a public \"duty\" to give.</p> <p>Here, it has generally been a private affair: not done to blow your own trumpet. \"It's cultural,\" says Beth Breeze of the <a href=\"http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/cphsj/\" title=\"\">centre for philanthropy, humanitarianism and social justice</a> at the University of Kent. \"The tax differences aren't enormous. Partly, it's because the US is better at asking. But in America, every Harvard graduate thinks: who's going to be the first in my year to have a building named after him? In New York, you haven't made it if you're not on the board of a major arts institution like the Met.\"</p> <p>There are big givers in Britain, certainly: the <a href=\"http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/cphsj/research/couttsmilliondonor.html\" title=\"\">Coutts Million Pound Donor Report</a> identifies 174 donations of \u00a31m or more in 2010, worth \u00a31.3bn. (This was down from \u00a31.6bn in 2006, but since the Sunday Times Rich List reported an 11.5% fall in donations by its major charitable givers last year \u2013 coinciding with a 37% fall in their wealth due to the recession \u2013 the general view is that philanthropy, under the circumstances, is holding up&#xa0;well.)</p> <p>But there's another angle to this very British reticence towards philanthropy, says Breeze, and as a left-leaning academic, it annoys her: \"It seems to be OK to be a local giver, raise money for charity, give a bit to <a href=\"http://www.comicrelief.com/\" title=\"\">Comic Relief</a>. But as soon as you add a few zeroes, people start thinking: something's up. What's in it for them?\"</p> <p>So press coverage of big givers \u2013 especially the Guardian \u2013 can be negative, even snide. There are unspoken inferences and unasked questions, suggests Breeze. \"How did these people get their money? Did they really earn it? Did they make it by exploitation? Or in something somehow shabby, like 'the man who introduced shellsuits to Britain', the 'curry king' or 'fake-tan queen'. Should they really have it at all? And this idea that people only really give to look good \u2026 Or to somehow 'redeem themselves'.\"</p> <p>Which is sad, reckons Breeze, because such attitudes do form \"a barrier to giving. People don't want to read that about themselves. And it's strange: we approve of charity, but disapprove of where the money comes from \u2013 rich individual donors.\" Her view is straightforward: \"Given we are where we are, do we want to cheer someone who does something to even out inequality, or discourage them?\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387090840\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331136030282/Kamagoma-in-Kenya-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kamagoma in Kenya\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">13-year-old Beryl and her baby brother Vincent live in Kamagoma in Kenya.

Photograph: Tomas Van Houtryve</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Merely by talking openly about his giving, then, John Caudwell is something of a novelty. But despite our jaundiced view, things are changing: TV programmes such as Channel 4's <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-secret-millionaire\" title=\"\">The Secret Millionaire</a> have helped, and more multimillion pound donors such as Sir Tom Hunter (Sports Division) and Dame Stephanie \"Steve\" Shirley (FI Group) are not shy about publicising their philanthropy.</p> <p>This is a characteristic, say some, of The New Philanthropy, a term that emerged a decade or so ago following the sudden explosion of earnings in the City of London. Breeze dislikes the term new, arguing that philanthropy has always evolved and adapted to suit the age; look back, she says, and you'll find examples thoughout history of all that supposedly defines a&#xa0;New&#xa0;Philanthropist.</p> <p>But a 21st-century model of philanthropy, new or not, does exist, and several factors lie behind it, says Plum Lomax of <a href=\"http://www.philanthropycapital.org/\" title=\"\">New Philanthropy Capital</a>, one of a number of institutions that now offer donors advice on their giving and are themselves part of the contemporary philanthropic scene. \"First, the past couple of decades have seen massive wealth creation; there's more money to give, even after the crisis,\" she says.</p> <p>\"And there's been a shift in the nature of that wealth: 15 years ago, 75% of the Sunday Times Rich List had inherited their wealth, and 25% were self-made. Those figures are now reversed.\" That has led to more people wanting to give more: surveys in the US show self-made money is three times as likely to be given away as inherited wealth. In the UK, the amount donated by the most generous givers on the Sunday Times Rich List increased tenfold, to \u00a33bn, between 2004 and 2009.</p> <p>There's something of a recent consensus, too, Lomax says, that for many wealthy individuals, \"giving while living\" is preferable \u2013 and certainly more fun \u2013 than endowing foundations in perpetuity. The \u00a315bn <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, for example, is designed to spend down its capital within 50 years of the death of its last founder.</p> <p>Similarly, High Net Worth Individuals (as they're known) are increasingly tending, as the billionaire US investor Warren Buffett puts it, to the view that very rich people \"should leave their children enough money so that they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing\". (\"Paris Hilton,\" says Breeze drily, \"has done a great deal for philanthropy in recent years.\")</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387090841\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331136202679/InToUniversity-007.jpg\" alt=\"InToUniversity\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Impetus Trust\u2019s \u2018venture philanthropy\u2019 supports this scheme for young people, InToUniversity.

      "bodyText": "What a difference eight months makes. \"I can't tell you what an honour it is to go start-to-finish with the same organization here in Indianapolis,\" said Peyton Manning after signing a new five-year, $90m contract with the Colts last July. \"After yesterday it is official that I will be an Indianapolis Colt for my entire career. I will not play for another team. My last down of football will be with the Colts, which means a great deal to me.\" For such words to hold true now would require Manning to never set foot on an NFL field again, after he confirmed that he is leaving the Colts. The news had already been widely trailed when it was revealed that Manning and the team owner Jim Irsay were to hold a joint news conference. In truth it has been anticipated for much longer than that. Manning's future in Indianapolis had been speculated on from the moment it emerged that his recovery from a neck surgery in May was not proceeding as well as anticipated. The player underwent a further operation in September \u2013 believed at the time to be his third in 19 months, though it would later emerge that he had undergone a further procedure during the summer. Having previously started every one of the Colts' games since being drafted in 1998, he would go on to miss the entire 2011 season. Without him the Colts would post their worst record since 1991 \u2013 winning just two games and positioning themselves for the first pick in the draft. With Manning fast approaching his 36th birthday and the Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck confirming his status as one of the greatest prospects at the position in many years, the realities of the situation began to dawn. For all Irsay's talk of restructuring Manning's deal, it would be almost impossible to justify squeezing two starting quarterbacks' salaries under the cap at the expense of the rest of the team. And so it was that the Colts came to part ways with one of the greatest quarterbacks in the history of the NFL. In his 13 healthy seasons with the Colts Manning has been selected to 11 Pro Bowls and been named as the league's Most Valuable Player on a record four separate occasions. He has only twice thrown for less than 4,000 yards in a season and never for less than 26 touchdowns. He is third on the all-time list for passing yards and touchdowns and holds more than 50 recognised NFL records. He has also transformed a franchise. Following their infamous, overnight relocation from Baltimore in 1984, the Colts had reached the playoffs just three times in their first 14 seasons in Indianapolis. With Manning under center they returned 11 times in 13 years, winning their division on eight occasions, their conference twice and finally the Super Bowl in February 2007. There are those who would go further, saying his presence has helped to change the image of an entire city. \"There is no Super Bowl held here without Peyton,\" the Indiana State museum curator Dale Ogden told Grantland as the city prepared to host that game for the first time ever this February. \"Without Peyton, the Colts would probably be in LA right now.\" That is just one opinion, of course, but what is beyond doubt is that Manning belongs to a rare order of NFL superstar. Even before his new contract, Manning was one of the highest-earning athletes in any American sport, with a reported $15m of income from commercial endorsements alone in 2010. To put that in perspective, even Tom Brady only made $10m from such sources over the same period. Manning has appeared in so many TV commercials that YouTube is now awash with greatest hit-style compilations. It is not hard to see why he is so favourably looked upon by marketing departments. The son of the talented and well-liked former New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning, Peyton might not be as handsome as a Brady or a Donovan McNabb, but makes up for that with a goofy and self-deprecating sense of humour. His comic timing, as shown off on Saturday Night Live in 2008, would put some professional comedians to shame. He can also be relied upon to stay out of trouble \u2013 an increasingly valuable commodity given the indiscretions of various other high-profile sportspeople in recent years. Peyton is as straight-laced as they come: his older brother Cooper having relayed in the past the story of how, at 12 years old, his decision to take off his shirt while on the golf course had sent his younger sibling into paroxysms of panic. \"What are you doing?\" Peyton exclaimed \"You're going to get us kicked out.\" Off the field, Manning's greatest known act of wild behaviour was singing his alma mater Tennessee's school fight song on stage at a music venue in that city, on a night when Kid Rock was also playing, after a win over the Titans all the way back in 2003. Friends have noted how, in his early years as a professional, he was so concerned about giving off an inappropriate image he would conceal his beer whenever photographs were being taken. Nor was this just some act of deception. Manning might enjoy an occasional beer but there is no suggestion of a double-life waiting to be uncovered. As well as anything his obsession with the game would not seem to allow time for it. His spare hours are spent watching film \u2013 reviewing even the kneel-down plays at the end of a game: gauging opponents' body language to see who is taking defeat well, and who is handling it badly. So singular is his focus on football, indeed, that as a younger man he failed to acquire many basic life skills. In 1999, during his second year in the league, his then girlfriend (now wife) Ashley relayed the story of how he had once phoned her seeking instructions on how to open a can of soup. On another occasion he called her from another state seeking help ordering a takeaway. His mother, meanwhile, had to issue Peyton with a series of polaroids of his own clothes showing him which ones went together. But his capacity to digest playbooks is unrivalled \u2013 allowing Manning to lead the Colts offence in a way quite unlike other NFL quarterbacks: operating almost exclusively without a huddle and calling his plays at the line. His pre-snap routine of shouts and hand gestures has been the source of both imitation and mockery, but its effectiveness cannot be doubted. Colts coaches initially pared the offence down to just two passes and four run options to allow Manning to operate in this way, but for many years now he has had the full playbook at his disposal. . Not everyone saw this success coming. \"People can say all they want about Peyton Manning \u2026 Peyton Manning had people in the NFL that were not high on him at all,\" recalled ESPN's draft expert Mel Kiper Jr of Manning's original NFL drafting. \"I had people tell me that if his name was Peyton Jones, he would be a third-round pick, that Ryan Leaf was better \u2026 There was no consensus on Manning.\" It did not take long for him to win over any sceptics in Indianapolis. He showed up for his first day of practice with the playbook already fully digested: spelling out the finer points of a play even to veterans. Any risk that he might be perceived as arrogant was offset by his approach: volunteering to fill in as a body for the scout team during special teams drills and requesting that his locker be moved so that it put him among his offensive linemen. Those outside the team were left to judge him on his performances. In his rookie season Manning was the only quarterback in the league not to miss a single snap \u2013 throwing for 3,739 yards and 26 touchdowns. He also threw 28 interceptions that year, but over the offseason challenged himself to do better. The next season brought more yards, the same number of touchdowns but 13 fewer picks \u2013 as well as a first trip to the playoffs. As the years went by, so his performances continued to improve \u2013 with former critics soon anointing him as the greatest pure passer of his generation. The only blot on his resume was that he seemed unable to accompany such performances with the one thing he and the Colts wanted most: a championship. Just as his college record was marked by an inability to beat the then dominant Florida Gators, so his pro career was being overshadowed by Brady and the New England Patriots. Brady has always been open in his admiration for Manning \u2013 stating after he was voted by his peers as the best player in the league last year that the award should have gone to the Colts quarterback (who finished second) \u2013 but for a long period theirs was a one-sided rivalry. Manning lost each of his first six games against the Patriots, including consecutive playoff defeats in 2004 and 2005. After the latter defeat \u2013 a 20-3 rout in the divisional round \u2013 the Boston sporting press went to town. \"He is Dan Marino. He is Karl Malone. He is Ted Williams,\" wrote Jackie MacMullan in the Boston Globe. \"He is the 21st century symbol of big numbers in the face of futility. Peyton Manning won football's MVP award this season, broke Marino's 21-year-old record for most touchdowns in a season (49), and has thrown for more than 29,000 career yards, but all he has to show for it this morning is another playoff hangover administered by the New England Patriots' defense \u2026 The numbers are great, but all he really wants to be is Tom Brady.\" For a time it did indeed appear as though Manning was destined to follow the same path as Marino \u2013 his great idol \u2013 remembered as one of the all-time greats but forever haunted over his failure to win a Super Bowl. It certainly felt that way midway through the Colts' next postseason meeting with the Patriots \u2013 the AFC Championship game on 21 January 2007. By the time Asante Samuel had intercepted Manning early in the second quarter that day, returning it to the house from 39 yards out, the Colts were 21-3 down. No team had ever overcome such a deficit in a championship game. And yet, rather than buckle Manning rallied his troops to a victory that would go down as one of the most memorable in league history, throwing for 349 yards and a score as they rallied to win 38-34. Two weeks later the Colts would prevail 29-17 at Super Bowl XLI. . The monkey finally off their back, Manning and the Colts would return to the Super Bowl three years later, though this time they would be defeated by Drew Brees and the underdog New Orleans Saints. There are those who feel Manning should still have won more in his career, that a player of such talent has underachieved if he wins just one Super Bowl \u2013 fewer now even than his younger and less naturally gifted brother Eli. But Manning can at least move on from Indianapolis knowing that he is not destined to finish up as Marino did \u2013 without any titles to show for his decade of dominance. Leaving Indianapolis at this point may also give him his best chance of winning another; the Colts will surely require more than a year to rebuild following this season's debacle. His next move is now destined to become the biggest story of this NFL offseason. Notwithstanding his physical status \u2013 and it must be noted that he was still unable to throw with anything like his usual power during practice sessions towards the end of last season \u2013 it seems certain that somebody will throw the dice on him, be it the Washington Redskins, New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs or Arizona Cardinals. For Manning that mean giving up on the dream of starting and finishing his career with the same team. But it could be the catalyst for fulfilling another one: that of claiming a second Super Bowl ring.",

      "bodyText": "Edward Gillespie, the managing director of Cheltenham racecourse, said on Wednesday that the first afternoon of the track's Festival meeting next Tuesday will offer \"great value\" to punters, even though three of the seven races are likely to have odds-on favourites. The two feature events on Tuesday's card, the Champion Hurdle and the Arkle Trophy, will also have relatively small fields after only 12 and 10 horses respectively were confirmed for the Grade One events at the six-day stage. Hurricane Fly, the defending champion hurdler, and Sprinter Sacre, the hot favourite for the Arkle, were both top-priced at 10-11 with bookmakers on Wednesday evening. Despite their cramped odds, however, Gilliespie believes that offers around even-money about Sprinter Sacre in particular are a sign that the competitive edge to Cheltenham's racing is as sharp as ever. \"It feels as though there are more short-priced favourites than usual this year,\" Gillespie said, \"though it may well be that someone will come up with the statistics to prove me wrong. But I saw the price about Sprinter Sacre yesterday and I thought that it is such great value. Anywhere else, he'd be going off at 3-1 on. So these favourites may be odds-on, but if so, there's value in the odds-on. \"It's beyond our scope to have every race with an average of 18 runners and the favourite going off at 5-1, but people have been around long enough to know that there's no such thing as a certainty at Cheltenham.

Hurricane Fly, the defending champion hurdler, and Sprinter Sacre, the hot favourite for the Arkle, were both top-priced at 10-11 with bookmakers on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Despite their cramped odds, however, Gilliespie believes that offers around even-money about Sprinter Sacre in particular are a sign that the competitive edge to Cheltenham's racing is as sharp as ever.</p> <p>\"It feels as though there are more short-priced favourites than usual this year,\" Gillespie said, \"though it may well be that someone will come up with the statistics to prove me wrong. But I saw the price about Sprinter Sacre yesterday and I thought that it is such great value. Anywhere else, he'd be going off at 3-1 on. So these favourites may be odds-on, but if so, there's value in the odds-on.</p> <p>\"It's beyond our scope to have every race with an average of 18 runners and the favourite going off at 5-1, but people have been around long enough to know that there's no such thing as a certainty at Cheltenham.

      "bodyText": "The simmering tension between Leicester and England regarding Toby Flood and Ben Youngs has finally boiled over amid complaints by the club that both half-backs have been poorly treated. England's new fly-half Owen Farrell has even waded into the debate, totally rejecting suggestions by the Tigers' coach, Matt O'Connor, that England \"do not want creative players and are just trying not to lose\". The row was sparked by O'Connor following Flood's exclusion from the matchday squad to face France this weekend, with Farrell and the fit-again Charlie Hodgson both preferred. Youngs has also lost his starting place to Northampton's Lee Dickson but O'Connor has accused the England management of \"not fully appreciating\" what Flood and Youngs can offer. He said it proved England were not interested in taking the game to the opposition. \"If that is what they are trying to achieve, you can understand why Flood and Youngs are not the best blokes for the job,\" O'Connor said. \"But if you are going out there to win a game, it has got to be Youngs and Flood at 9 and 10. \"There is nothing I have seen so far [in the Six Nations] that indicates England want to go out and beat teams. Under the current structure, I cannot see that changing.\" O'Connor added that the demotion of Flood and Youngs had dented the pair's confidence. \"It has created self-doubt and that is unnecessary. They are asking questions of themselves unnecessarily and that is impacting on their decision-making. Don't start telling me that they are bad players because I am not having it.\" The impact made by Farrell and Hodgson in England's three games to date, however, has been significant and the 20-year-old Farrell does not accept O'Connor's second-hand diagnosis. \"He is entitled to his own opinion but we have our own views. The way we played against Wales was a massive step in the right direction for us and we all thought that. We are massively excited about the way we are going and hope we can build on that. \"I don't think I have ever had a mindset of going out to avoid defeat, otherwise you don't play how you want to. The way we played against Wales proves it. There is a structure in place but it is a structure which allows you to be yourself and play the way you play. I don't think anybody has changed their personal game to fit into the structure.\" This particular argument could run and run, particularly as Andy Farrell, Owen's father, is England's interim backs coach. O'Connor is clearly trying to boost the morale of his players but it has been apparent for months that Youngs, in particular, is short of form and confidence. Both he and Flood have also had injury lay-offs, although the pair enjoyed good games against Gloucester at the weekend. Unfortunately for Flood, so did Hodgson for Saracens against Wasps. Given the latter's contribution to England's away wins over Scotland and Italy, Stuart Lancaster's decision to recall him for the trip to France was hardly a major surprise. Hodgson, for his part, also believes O'Connor is mistaken. \"We have the right intentions and whether Matt O'Connor agrees with that is entirely down to him. We created chances against Wales so we know we're on the right track. We're fully confident that what we're doing is the right thing.\" Leicester, though, are clearly irked and have pointedly declined to involve Flood in their LV Cup semi-final against Bath despite England specifically making the player available for the game. George Ford will play at 10 while Farrell resumes the job of making England's backline tick. \"Every game we have got better as a team,\" Farrell stressed. \"We have massive belief in what we are trying to do here and we will keep getting better because of that.\"",

      "bodyText": "Examine Alex Salmond's five-year timetable for resolving Scotland's future relations with the United Kingdom and, wherever you stand on the issue of independence, it all seems remarkably straightforward. But the more you think about it, the more obvious it gets that it's not straightforward at all. The Scottish National party version of the next five years goes like this: 2012 \u2013 consultation on the details of the question to be put to Scots about their future; 2013 \u2013 legislation by the Scottish parliament to hold an independence referendum; 2014 \u2013 campaign and referendum vote; 2015 \u2013 consequential negotiations on the transition to independence following a yes vote; and, finally, 2016 \u2013 the first general election in an independent Scotland. Most of the political argument about this proposed process has concentrated, not unnaturally, on the early phases. Scottish politics is currently bewitched by an arm-wrestling contest between Salmond and the UK government over pre-poll issues like the date of the referendum, the question to be put to voters, and the terms of the franchise. That arm wrestle is far from settled yet, but an outline answer may be taking shape. In the end, there will have to be a compromise over extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, including a pledge to look at lowering the voting age more generally. Even more important, it looks increasingly probable that there will only be one question on the ballot paper \u2013 a yes or no on independence \u2013 but with anchoring pledges from at least Labour and the Liberal Democrats on deeper devolution in a second phase if there's a no vote on independence. In my view that's the clearest and fairest way forward. That leaves the date. Right now that looks harder, with fewer issues of principle at stake. The SNP has briefed that its intended date is 18 October 2014. The UK government, by contrast, still sticks to the sooner-rather-than-later formula used by David Cameron in Edinburgh last month. In the broad sweep of history, the difference between 2013 and 2014 hardly matters. In many ways the battle between the two has become a matter of political face. But if you look at the SNP timetable from the other end, from the perspective of what might happen after a yes vote in the referendum rather than before it, the difference between the two dates begins to matter rather a lot. The impact of a yes vote in October 2014 would be tremendous. Scotland's course would have been set, and the Scottish government would begin to negotiate with London on how it would happen. Yet bear in mind three things. First, even after the vote, the decision to grant Scotland independence would still rest with the UK government and parliament. Second, the delicate political protocols of the campaign would mean that little work of substance would have been done, either in Edinburgh or London, on implementing the separation of Scotland until the vote was over. And third, politics in the rest of the UK in autumn 2014 would be focused at least as much on the forthcoming May 2015 UK general election as on Scotland. This all raises enormous doubt about whether the negotiations and the transition to independence could possibly be carried out on the timetable that the SNP purports to expect. Unpicking the relationship between Scotland and the UK is a complex task, even assuming it is done in good faith. Agreement on the terms would not be straightforward. Assigning Scotland's share of assets and liabilities could be fraught. There would be a forest of serious issues to hack through, including the currency, the European Union and the BBC. With the best will in the world, this is tough stuff. And then there is the 2015 general election. As soon as Scotland voted for independence, the West Lothian question would have to be confronted. It is likely there would be some immediate effort to bar Scots MPs from voting not just on English issues, but UK issues too. But this is as nothing to the potential for instability caused by the 2015 election itself. That election would take place in Scotland too. Presumably the SNP would contest it. But the status and role of the new Scottish MPs, a majority of whom might be opposed to independence but who would all lose their seats as soon as the independence legislation was passed, would be hard to predict. Above all, there is the question of what happens if the 2015 election produces a result, as it may, which enables Labour to form a UK government that would lose its majority as soon as the Scots departed? These are serious hypothetical questions. The prospect of highly unstable UK and Scottish politics in the wake of a yes vote is very great. It could all get uglier than we suppose. That's not, in itself, an argument against Scottish independence. But it is an argument in favour of doing what one can to minimise that possibility. And that means, I think, holding the vote earlier, not entangling it in a turbulent UK election with a possibly close outcome. For the dignity of politics, and for the dignity of the possibility of Scottish independence, more time is needed for any possible transition. That is why it is in everyone's interests to agree that the referendum should be held in 2013, not 2014. Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "In an otherwise empty shop in Newcastle, there is a car crash going on. A VW Golf is being slowly shunted, by hidden hydraulics, into the wallpapered wall. The car is moving 7mm per hour, and it will take all of March for the collision, devised by Jonathan Schipper, to evolve. I stand and watch, waiting for the sound of panels crumpling, a crack to appear in the windscreen, the wall to cave. It could take days. Maybe I should call for help. Time appears to be slowing down, just as it does in the violent instant of sudden impact. But I am a man in a hurry, on a 24-hour dash around Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland, trying to catch as much as I can of As Slow As Possible, the fifth and most ambitious AV Festival of Art, Technology, Music and Film, which continues all month. There are exhibitions, concerts, films, performances, readings and walks. A whole radio channel, Radio Boredcast, is playing a marvellously motley selection of programmes: as I write, I'm listening to John Cage in conversation with composer Morton Feldman. The festival needs more time than anyone could possibly have, and takes its title from an organ piece by Cage \u2013 a performance of which, begun in 2001 in a church in Germany, isn't scheduled to reach its conclusion until 2640. That's 639 years. See you at the interval. Cage and Feldman are inspirations for Susan Stenger's sound installation, which resonates under the concrete domed entrance to the Newcastle Civic Centre. Trained as a classical flautist, Stenger is best known as a rock bassist and leader of the Band of Susans. Her work The Structure of Everyday Life: Full Circle builds and decays as it filters out into the surroundings. Using clock time and lunar cycles, the I Ching and the Chinese zodiac, musical development and the harmonic circle of fourths, Stenger's composition is as much sculptural and environmental as it is something to be listened to. Vertiginous, droning, rushing, discrete, insidious and extremely beautiful, such orchestral slowness makes me feel I am standing in a whirling panopticon, surrounded by her circle of speakers, Newcastle in early spring roaring beyond the 1960s concrete pillars. The work starts to inhabit you, just as you inhabit the space. It's a perfect match. The theme of the festival is more than simply slowness, duration or endurance. Benedict Drew's The Persuaders, installed in the Newcastle building where Robert Stephenson built the Rocket steam locomotive in 1829, had me running for the door. \"Breathe in, breathe out,\" said a spooky hypnotic voice. Another spooky voice, which I think was my own, whispered \"Leave now, asshole\", so I did. What's with the slowness? I didn't even have time to grab any slow food. The festival's director, Rebecca Shatwell, seems to be a human whirlwind, too. She's trying to encourage us all to slow down \u2013 which is why I'm counting out the millennia, reading a list of odd-numbered years into the far-flung future, while the woman who sits beside me at the big desk in an empty gallery at Baltic, in Gateshead, reads out the even ones. \"Four hundred and eighty one thousand seven hundred and sixty three AD \u2026 Four hundred and eighty one thousand seven hundred and sixty, er, eighty, oh blimey, I've missed my place. Start again. Four hundred and \u2026\" I'm fluffing it. Between us, the female volunteer and I are reading from the 20 volumes of a book filled with nothing but columns of dates, going a million years into the future, and a million into the past. Japanese artist On Karawa's 1993 work, One Million Years, will have members of the public at it all month, working in pairs for as long as they can bear. I managed 20 minutes. Keep going and apparently the task gets easier; part of the mind detaches itself like a little pop-up counting machine, and performs the task on automatic pilot. Some things you can dip in and out of; others need constant vigilance. To a few, I just surrender. Bob Levene's film Inertial Frame, at the Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art in Sunderland, shows the islands and inlets of the Finnish archipelago passing by the camera's fixed and steady eye, filmed in fading and uncertain light. On a sofa in the darkened space, I drifted, too. In the next room, I am plunged into industrial Milwaukee. Back in 1977, James Benning filmed 60 locations in Milwaukee's industrial valley, for 60 seconds each. In 2004, he returned and filmed the places and people who appeared in the earlier film again. Last summer he shot a third version, One Way Boogie Woogie, 2012, premiered here. Big projections line the walls: frontal views of walls and buildings, a plume of smoke from an industrial chimney, railway trucks passing under the silos; this last shot is filled with a melancholic, formal grandeur reminiscent of the paintings and photographs of Charles Scheeler. The US flag flapping in the wind, a hotel sign against the night sky, and somewhere in the aural mix, a Leonard Cohen song plays.. Benning's long shots are elegies to the commonplace and particular. A sun-struck wall, a railyard, an empty street \u2013 how haunting and elegiac these visual reports become. A further work by Benning is installed at Middlesborough station. On one screen we watch molten pig-iron and slag being collected in railway wagons, in the belly of a steel plant in Duisburg, Germany. It is raining. You can almost taste the smoking metal. On an adjacent screen, Benning has slowed down a 14-second, 1971 black and white scrap of footage, of a worker leaving a Milwaukee factory, so that it lasts 31 minutes, the same length as the footage shot in Duisburg. Over at Middlesborough Institute of Modern Art, I missed the caretaker who allegedly appears in John Gerrard's monumental filmed circumnavigation of a ruined 1960s school, set in an almost empty landscape in Cuba. The school turns before us on a deserted pan of crumbling concrete. The day passes from dawn to dusk in real time; the light changes. Perhaps \u2013 who knows? \u2013 there will be a storm. Gerrard's films are virtual worlds built using customised computer-game software, and based on site photographs and satellite data. Get close to the huge screen and the image never falters. Here's the decaying concrete, the banana palms in the distance, the ruined modernist edifice turning under a digitised sky. The image goes on and on, and I go with it. Lingering isn't always desirable. I wonder at the months, or possibly years, artist Agnes Meyer Brandis spent training a flock of geese to become astronauts. Moon Goose Analogue is on show at Newcastle's Great North Museum, which is filled with stuffed animals. (Turn left at the dinosaurs, says my itinerary.) The film of her efforts is hilarious, but the installation, decked out as a space centre, where you can watch the geese in live time in a simulated moon environment somewhere in Italy, is an overegged bore. One of the best things about this festival is that it takes you to places you otherwise might never go \u2013 whether to Finland or Milwaukee, or to the wonderful cast-iron architecture of the Great Hall at Newcastle's Discovery Museum, where Fluxus veteran Yoshi Wada's collection of sirens, foghorns and a ship's ventilator clang and whine and go about their noisy, computer-assisted business. God, is that the time? I'm watching the clock in a Sunderland shop window, where a team of 72 workers is constantly erecting and demolishing arrangements of planks that tell the time, minute by minute, hour by hour. They rebuilt the structure 1,611 times, to create a physical 24-hour clock in a patch of Berlin wasteground, filmed by Mark Formanek and called Standard Time (you can watch it on the Guardian's website). This is fun, but not as good as Christian Marclay's film The Clock, which the festival tried to get but couldn't. Marclay's work is the absent ghost at the feast.How long does a festival or an exhibition take? As long as it lasts and then some, is the answer.",

On an adjacent screen, Benning has slowed down a 14-second, 1971 black and white scrap of footage, of a worker leaving a Milwaukee factory, so that it lasts 31 minutes, the same length as the footage shot in Duisburg.</p> <p>Over at Middlesborough Institute of Modern Art, I missed the caretaker who allegedly appears in John Gerrard's monumental filmed circumnavigation of a ruined 1960s school, set in an almost empty landscape in Cuba. The school turns before us on a deserted pan of crumbling concrete. The day passes from dawn to dusk in real time; the light changes. Perhaps \u2013 who knows? \u2013 there will be a storm. Gerrard's films are virtual worlds built using customised computer-game software, and based on site photographs and satellite data. Get close&#xa0;to the huge screen and the image never falters. Here's the decaying concrete, the banana palms in the distance, the ruined modernist edifice turning under a digitised sky. The image goes on and on, and I go with it.</p> <p>Lingering isn't always desirable. I wonder at the months, or possibly years, <a href=\"http://www.artscatalyst.org/projects/detail/moon_goose_analogue_agnes_meyer_brandis/\" title=\"\">artist Agnes Meyer Brandis spent training a flock of geese to become astronauts</a>. Moon Goose Analogue is on show at Newcastle's Great North Museum, which is filled with stuffed animals. (Turn left at the dinosaurs, says my itinerary.) The film of her efforts is hilarious, but the installation, decked out as a space centre, where you can watch the geese&#xa0;in live time in a simulated moon environment somewhere in Italy, is an overegged bore.</p> <p>One of the best things about this festival is that it takes you to places you otherwise might never go \u2013 whether to Finland or Milwaukee, or to the wonderful cast-iron architecture of the Great Hall at Newcastle's Discovery Museum, where <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdQWNsqY7o\" title=\"\">Fluxus veteran Yoshi Wada</a>'s collection of sirens, foghorns and a ship's ventilator clang and whine and go about their noisy, computer-assisted business.</p> <p>God, is that the time? I'm watching the clock in a Sunderland shop window, where a team of 72 workers is constantly erecting and demolishing arrangements of planks that tell the time, minute by minute, hour by hour. They rebuilt the structure 1,611 times, to create <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPbm_uEiwRY&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">a physical 24-hour clock in a patch of Berlin wasteground, filmed by Mark Formanek</a> and called Standard Time (you can watch it on the Guardian's website). This is fun, but not as good as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/feb/01/tate-buys-christian-marclay-clock\" title=\"\">Christian Marclay's film The Clock</a>, which the festival tried to get but couldn't. Marclay's work is the absent ghost at the feast.How long does a festival or an exhibition take? As long as it lasts and then some, is the answer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Alex Ferguson has warned Manchester United must \"waken up\" from their European malaise at Old Trafford or risk a second early exit of the season when they face Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League on Thursday night. United have toiled at home in European competition all season and almost compounded their failure in the Champions League group phase by falling to Ajax on their debut in the Europa League. The Amsterdam club's 2-1 win in the last-32 second-leg ended an 11-game undefeated home run for Ferguson's team in Europe and the Dutch side needed only one more goal to progress at United's expense despite trailing 3-0 on aggregate after six minutes at Old Trafford. The result also left United with only one win from four home European matches this term, and Ferguson admits a vast improvement is required against Marcelo Bielsa's impressive side. The United manager said: \"It's a very difficult tie. From what we've seen, Bilbao are a very progressive team in Spain at the moment and it's going to be a difficult game for us. It's a game in which we need to waken up, there's no question about that. Some of our European form this season has been disappointing but it's an opportunity to progress and we have to take that opportunity. But it will need a very good performance.\" Ferguson cited complacency as a factor in United's Champions League demise and took the blame for the Ajax defeat himself, having fielded a young defence. He claimed that lesson, at least, has been learned and an experienced United team is expected to start the last-16 first leg. \"I don't know if we're making too many changes in these games,\" he added. \"Certainly in the second leg against Ajax we did that, and in the Champions League group stage we made some changes. But we made mistakes in the group stage too, so it's our own fault. But we'll play a strong side against Bilbao and hopefully that makes a difference.\" Bilbao are fifth in La Liga and have secured a place in the final of the Copa del Rey against Barcelona, with their coveted centre-forward Fernando Llorente \u2013 scorer of 13 goals in 22 league games this season \u2013 highlighted as an obvious threat by Ferguson. He said: \"Unlike [most] centre-forwards from Spain, he's tall and a great header of the ball. His scoring record is very good this year. \"They've got different qualities from a lot of Spanish teams. They press the ball very well and they're not afraid to flood players forward in attack. They're very positive and have no hesitation in committing themselves to attack at any point, with a number of players. It's the best Athletic Bilbao team I've seen for some years.\" Ferguson is confident, however, that the recent improvement in his goalkeeper David de Gea, plus the central-defensive partnership of Rio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans, gives United a platform to stifle the threat from the Basque club. \"Ferdinand's form in particular over the last couple of months has been outstanding,\" he said. \"It does tell you that when you play two partners together for longer periods rather than chop and change it makes a difference. Jonny Evans has emerged through having the experience of playing with Rio, so that's been a plus for us. I'll accept 1-0 against Bilbao rather than 2-1 or 3-2 without question.\" De Gea produced a vital late save against Ajax at Old Trafford, as he has done against Chelsea, Liverpool, Norwich and others, to claim the United supporters' player of the month award for February. And Ferguson admits the decision to take the young Spaniard out of the team following the FA Cup defeat at Liverpool has paid dividends. The United manager said: \"He had a bad game against Liverpool and I felt he was better than that. He had to get his confidence back in terms of handling that particular defeat because if you lose to Liverpool it's a big defeat. Since then he's been outstanding. He's grasped the nettle, his training performances have been fantastic and he's transferred that into the game situation very well.\" De Gea concurred: \"The time I spent on the bench when I was out of the team I could reflect, think hard and regroup. I started working harder to come out of that spell. It made me more determined so when I did get that opportunity to get back in the side I grabbed it with both hands. The thing now is to keep this good form because you know that one slight slip-up and you've got quality players waiting in the wings to grab their opportunity as well.\"",

      "bodyText": "Greece has been edging towards a deal with its private-sector creditors as the hours ticked away towards Thursday's deadline for the agreement required to trigger a fresh \u20ac130bn bailout for its troubled economy. As the standoff between the government in Athens and bondholders reached its climax, the body representing financial institutions in the talks said investors holding more than 40% of Greece's debt had now agreed to accept losses of more than 50% on their bonds. The Private-Creditor-Investment Committee (PCIC) for Greece said the list of those institutions signed up to the deal included RBS, HSBC, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Germany's Deutsche Bank. A statement by the PCIC gave strong backing to the private sector involvement in a Greek debt write-down necessary for it to receive financial help from the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank. The involvement of most Greek institutions will take the total above 50% and there was hope that the deal would ultimately secure the support of banks, pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds that own 75% of the country's \u20ac206bn private-sector debt. That prospect helped financial markets steady after the sharp drop on Tuesday. Reuters said it had been told by a senior source in the Greek finance ministry that the government was confident that well over 75% of eligible bonds would be submitted for a debt swap. That would comfortably clear the 50% legal threshold for an agreement to be valid and the two-thirds cut-off point at which Greece would be able to impose a deal on bondholders through a collective action clause passed by its parliament. But a significant minority of investors \u2013 including five small Greek pension funds \u2013 are still refusing to sign a deal. Some hedge funds have said the so-called \"haircut\" of 53.5% is too severe and have said they will take legal action to secure better terms. Evangelos Venizelos, Greece's finance minister, attacked the institutions and warned that they risked making their holdings worthless by their hardline stance. \"If the PSI does not succeed, what will be the value of their bonds? Zero!\" The strong language from Venizelos was seen as a threat to those bondholders \u2013 amounting to 14% of the total \u2013 whose investments are held under international rather than Greek law and would therefore not be subject to any collective action clause imposed by Athens. Analysts warned there could be a sharp sell-off in the markets in the event Greece failed to win the support of enough bondholders by the deadline. The consultants Capital Economics said if the deal failed to attract two-thirds support \"there could be a particularly adverse reaction in the financial markets as it could potentially prompt the rest of the eurozone to withdraw the bailout deal\". It added: \"While some policymakers and commentators have suggested that this might not be disastrous, we think that it could have rather more serious implications and undermine confidence in policymakers' ability to prevent the debt crisis from spreading to Italy and Spain.\" European policy makers are optimistic that the deal with Greece's private-sector creditors is the final hurdle in a crisis stretching back to late 2009. The damage to 17-nation eurozone economies from the debt crisis was underlined on Wednesday by much worse-than expected data from both Germany and Spain. Germany, the single currency's strongest economy, posted a 2.7% drop in factory orders in January, against an expected 0.5% rise. Weaker demand from overseas was held mainly responsible. Meanwhile, industrial output in Spain \u2013 where Madrid has announced plans to slow the pace of deficit reduction in the light of fears about a looming recession \u2013 was 4.2% lower in January than a year earlier. Simon Smith, chief economist at FxPro, said: \"What really matters beyond this week is the extent to which the EU powers can convince investors that this really is a one-off. Any residual fears in peripheral eurozone nations that they could be next have the potential to be the most disruptive force going forward, and Portugal currently looks to be the most vulnerable to such perceptions.\"",

      "bodyText": "The exchange was eloquent, a treatise on image and reality, the two faces of Marcelo Bielsa. It was played out at Estadio el Madrigal where Villarreal had just drawn 2-2 with Athletic Bilbao. Athletic's coach was addressing the media in his normal way \u2013 voice low, gaze lower \u2013 when he was asked about his odd touchline behaviour. Was it coincidence that after every Villarreal attack, he got up from his haunches and paced to the other side of his technical area, taking exactly 13 steps? Bielsa did not look at his questioner. He never does. Staring down, he spoke in his usual slow monotone. \"What is coincidence,\" he replied, \"is that when there's such a nice game going on, someone spends time counting my paces.\" They call the Argentinian El Loco and maybe they look too hard for madness. The way Athletic are playing, watching him not his team is absurd, yet it is hard not to be drawn to him. Bielsa is unusual, there is something addictive about his actions. Besides, person and professional are inseparable. The question is: is he really as mad as he is portrayed? \"No,\" says the forward Iker Munia\u00edn. \"He is madder.\" Bielsa arrived last summer and Athletic's players still have not completely worked him out. They have never seen anything like him and do not think they ever will. He is disconcerting, praising awful performances and bemoaning brilliant ones. Above all, he is intense. Compulsive. Obsessive. Mad. \"He lives for football,\" the striker Fernando Llorente says. There are days, adds teh midfielder Javi Mart\u00ednez, when he does not leave the Lezama training ground until the small hours. It is, he says, \"insane\". When he arrived, Bielsa had watched their 38 league games last season, writing all the details on colour-coded spreadsheets. And that really is all the details \u2013 he says: \"There are 36 different forms of communicating through a pass.\" He watches thousands of games, building a footballing taxonomy, like some kind of botanist. If a player does something new, he labels and stores it, learning from it. Teaching from it, too. Few are so didactic: he once drew on his shoes to show players exactly which part of their foot to use, wearing them for days after. Video sessions can last five hours and players joke that they do not dare make a mistake lest the green laser rest upon them and Bielsa demand a convincing explanation. Training is intense, even when Bielsa takes children from the crowd and gets them to deliver instructions for him. Stopwatch in hand, he preaches high pressure, constantly interrupting and demonstrating. Gangs of players sprint from pole to pole, hunting as a coordinated pack, their errors revealed to them on a laptop. There is an almost childish wonder about Pep Guardiola's description of Athletic: \"They all run up \u2026 and they all run down again. Up, down, up, down, up, down. They're fascinating.\" All endeavour, no aesthetics? No. Bielsa, a former Argentina and Chile manager, has altered Athletic's historic identity as the most \"English\" of teams, teaching them in the words of one insider \"not to be afraid of the ball any more\". They have scored almost twice as many headers as any other team in Spain but where the ball used to be thumped into the area at the first opportunity, it is now being worked up the pitch. Only Madrid and Barcelona have completed more passes or scored more goals. \"The style is totally different,\" says the defender Andoni Iraola; Llorente does the \"opposite\" of what he did before. Synchronisation is fundamental, attacks automatic, movement mechanised, the pitch partitioned with tape, moves constructed and deconstructed piece by piece, passes made instantly. The circulation is constant. One exercise involves eight squares: two players cannot occupy the same space; if a team-mate enters your square, you vacate it. Crossing and shooting exercises, following specific, interchanging \"passageways\", do not end with the shot but with players sprinting back into their starting positions. Defence and attack are not separate. \"A man with new ideas is mad until he succeeds,\" Bielsa notes. Athletic did not win in their first five games as they struggled to assimilate new ideas; since then, they have lost only three of 21 and are one point from the Champions League places, their best finish for 13 years on the cards. They are in the Copa del Rey final, seeking a first trophy in 28 years, and supporters are enjoying their football like never before. The sparkle in the eye of players, the sheer number of fans travelling to England \u2013 Old Trafford's highest ever away contingent \u2013 reveals what facing Manchester United means. A few weeks ago, Bielsa was stopped by a group of kids who asked him to sign their sticker album. He said no, he had a better idea. He took the album off them and told them to meet him the following day, same place, same time. When he turned up 24 hours later, the entire team had signed the album.

      "bodyText": "A couple of decades ago a lively debate raged within the John Lewis Partnership: should Waitrose be ditched? More than a few partners in the department stores, regarding themselves as the organisation's royalty, resented how the grubby grocer, struggling to find a foothold in the supermarket game, was diluting the staff bonus pool. That pool, remember, is distributed on a \"one partnership, one bonus\" basis, a principle that was tricky to defend when Waitrose was adding lots of partners but not bringing in much profit. And today? The position has reversed entirely. Waitrose had a less than vintage year last year \u2013 operating profits were down 5% to \u00a3261m \u2013 but the department stores had a stinker. Some 28 out of 29 shops suffered lower sales (Peter Jones, shopkeeper to the posh folk of Kensington and Chelsea, was the exception) and operating profits fell 20% to \u00a3158m. Another year like that and Waitrose's profits contribution will be twice the department stores'. Should Waitrose workers now be resentful? Well, not yet. There are many more of them than there are department store employees: on a crude cash-profit-per-partner measure, they are only slightly ahead of their department store colleagues. What about the future, though? What would happen if Waitrose were to pull further ahead, not just in total profits but in profits-per-partner? Would harmony within the partnership survive a permanent shift in the make-up of the business? The bosses' hope, of course, is that the question will never arise: they're trusting that profits from the department stores, traditionally more cyclical, will come roaring back. And now there's another factor at play - more integration and executive chairman Charlie Mayfield's pursuit of \"customer centricity\". For example: online shoppers can now order John Lewis goods to be collected from 129 Waitrose stores. Some of those shoppers will also buy a few groceries when they collect. Should the department stores get a commission for that trade? How could it be measured? Well, yes, operating lines will inevitably become blurred. But even in a decade's time, the partnership will almost certainly still be reporting separate profit lines for Waitrose and John Lewis. If the gap in performance continues to widen, Mayfield, or his successor, could yet have a problem in defending the \"we're all in this together\" philosophy at bonus time. To be fair, it's a problem (if it arises) for the next decade rather than this one. But, by then, the charity of John Lewis partners in tolerating Waitrose's stumbles in the early 1990s will be forgotten. An interesting test for the partnerships' lauded (rightly so) bonus system could be brewing.",

      "bodyText": "The staff bonus at the John Lewis Partnership has become the latest casualty of the high street downturn after falling annual profits reduced the size of payouts to workers in its department stores and supermarket chain, Waitrose, for the first time in three years. Its 81,000 staff will get an extra seven weeks pay in this month's pay packet compared with nine weeks they picked up last year. Profits at its department stores, in particular, were battered by ferocious discounting elsewhere on the high street. With group profits down 4% at \u00a3353.8m, the bonus pool shrank with staff receiving a bonus equal to 14% of annual salary compared with 18% in 2011. Its chairman Charlie Mayfield said that after the toughest year for retailers since the onset of the financial crisis it was not surprising the bonus was \"somewhat lower\": \"The bonus does go up and down. It's very important it does, otherwise it would not reflect the performance of the business.\" The average bonus payment for the last five years is 15% but it has fallen to as low as 4% in 1954. Mayfield said the retailer was grappling with structural change in the retail market as sales transferred from its stores to the internet. Although sales via John Lewis's website surged more than 26%, takings at all its department stores barring Peter Jones in London's upmarket Sloane Square were down. \"Profound changes are taking place in the retail sector and importantly this was a year when we upped the pace of innovation and investment,\" he said. \"That came at the price of some short-term profit but leaves us in a good place at the start of this year.\" Consumer spending had also been reset on a \"different trajectory\", he added, with no expectation of a return to the retail boom that preceded the credit crunch. Spend, spend, spend The partnership's annual results are a red letter day for staff and there were no grumbles among the 800 John Lewis workers at its newest branch, in the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre that backs on to the Olympic Park in east London. The figure was met with clapping and whoops of joy as exotic summer holidays and shopping sprees were brought within reach. John Lewis partner Adam Richardson said: \"A bonus is a bonus. I'm not disappointed in the slightest as we can see that other retailers are struggling.\" Wendy O'Mahoney, who was unemployed for four years before getting a job at the centre's Waitrose branch when it opened last year, said: \"It's more than I expected, I am really happy, it's my first bonus so I am really chuffed. I am going to spend, spend, spend.\" John Lewis managing director Andy Street said the department store's \"never knowingly undersold\" pledge, which sees it match rivals' promotions, had cost it almost \u00a324m during the year and was a major factor behind its weak financial performance, with profits down \u00a340.5m to \u00a3157.9m on sales of \u00a33.3bn in the year to 28 January. Its larger sister chain Waitrose, with annual sales of more than \u00a35bn, fared better although profits still fell 5% at \u00a3260.6m. The decline was blamed on heavy investment in 29 new branches as well as a so-called \"dark store\" in London that is not open to the public but instead used to pick internet orders. Its market share edged up 0.2% to 4.1% during the year with the grocer, aided by successful tie-ups with Delia Smith and Heston Blumenthal, ringing up an extra 400,000 transactions a week. After a grim 2011 Mayfield was \"cautiously optimistic\" the trading environment would pick up this year as events such as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics buoyed the spirits of consumers. In the five weeks since the end of the reporting period both chains had enjoyed like-for-like sales of more than 2%.",

      "bodyText": "Mitt Romney's campaign team has appealed for his rivals to quit the Republican presidential race, claiming that it is near impossible for them to catch him after the Super Tuesday results and that by staying in they are boosting President Barack Obama's re-election chances. But Rick Santorum, boosted by his three wins on Tuesday and running Romney close in Ohio, was out on the campaign trail again on Wednesday and stubbornly refusing to concede, intent on pushing Romney to the end. The former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, too was out campaigning and refusing to pull out. Another series of bruising and bitter contests beckons, with the next big test in Illinois on 20 March, which will again pit Romney against Santorum and expose Republican faultlines. Despite his advantages in dollars and organisation, Romney failed to make a decisive break on Super Tuesday, unable to put together a winning coalition of voters that would knock out his opponents and concentrate on gathering money and energy in preparing to take on Obama for the White House in November. Democrats expressed glee at the outcome. David Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, in a phone conference with reporters from campaign headquarters in Chicago, described the Republican campaign as a death march. \"Romney wanted to put the campaign away. Instead of Super Tuesday, it became super glue today. They are still stuck.\" Jim Messina, Obama's campaign chief, added: \"Every primary we have seen shows how disappointed Republicans are with their candidates \u2026 dissatisfaction on Super Tuesday was super-sized.\" The Romney campaign hoped Tuesday's votes would have proved to be more decisive and had been planning a more robust appeal to Santorum and Gingrich to quit. Instead, they had to opt for a more muted plea. One of Romney's campaign advisers, Rich Beeson, argued that the maths showed Santorum and Gingrich were unlikely to catch up and the only beneficiary of a protracted Republican race would be Obama. \"Super Tuesday dramatically reduced the likelihood that any of governor Romney's opponents can obtain the Republican nomination. As governor Romney's opponents attempt to ignore the basic principles of math, the only person's odds of winning they are increasing are President Obama's,\" Beeson said. With about 20 out of the 50 states having voted in Republican primaries and caucuses, Romney has accumulated only about a third of the 1,144 delegates to the Republican convention in August that he needs to secure the nomination. The race seems set to rumble on through the spring and summer, culminating in Utah in June. Santorum, after his election night party in Ohio on Tuesday, began campaigning on Wednesday in Kansas, which votes on Saturday and which polls suggest he stands a good chance of winning, and in Mississippi, which votes next Tuesday and looks favourable either for him or Gingrich. Alabama, also up next Tuesday, could go to either Santorum or Gingrich. Brad Coker, head of southern-based Mason-Dixon polling, said the Republicans should calm down. \"They are freaking out because it is March and the contests are still going on. Historically, it is rare for these fights to be over quickly,\" he said. He said Romney would be the nominee. While upcoming states did not look favourable to him the big states that followed \u2013 California, New York and New Jersey \u2013 would all go for Romney, as well as smaller states such as Connecticut and Rhode Island. He might also win Illinois. Romney will be favourite in Illinois among better-off voters in urban Chicago while Santorum is likely to win the backing of the Republican working-class, social conservatives, Christian evangelicals and rural areas. Super Tuesday, the biggest night of a campaign that began on 3 January, resulted in Romney taking six of the 10 states at stake: Vermont, Virginia \u2013 where Santorum and Gingrich were not on the ballot because of organisational incompetence \u2013 Massachusetts, Alaska and, the big prize of the night, Ohio. \"Romney didn't just win Super Tuesday \u2013 he crushed it,\" his press spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom tweeted. Another Romney campaign adviser said that Super Tuesday had been the last opportunity for Santorum and Gingrich to close the delegate gap and they had failed to take the opportunity. But the Santorum and Gingrich camps, not unsuprisingly, had a different take, saying the results again showed up Romney's vulnerabilities and the unhappiness with him among conservatives. Santorum took Oklahoma, Tennessee and North Dakota, while Gingrich, adding to the confused picture, won his home state, Georgia. This was despite being outspent by Romney in advertising. In the showdown in Ohio, traditionally one of America's big swing states, Romney just held off a strong challenge from Santorum, taking 38% of the vote to Santorum's 37%, with Gingrich trailing in third place on 15% and Ron Paul, fighting a modest campaign, on 9%. Romney hinted at the toll the long campaign is taking on him as he flew from Ohio to Boston on Tuesday night. \"I'm looking forward to being home, sleeping in our own bed tonight. This has been a long one,\" Romney said. Adding in Super Tuesday, Romney has now won 13 states, Santorum six \u2013he is almost certain to add Missouri later this month, having come out on top in a test-run last month \u2013 and Gingrich, two. Paul has yet to record a win and had hoped to take one of the smaller states: Idaho, North Dakota or Alaska. He admitted his chances of winning the nomination are slim. According to the Associated Press, Romney added about 200 delegates to his tally on Super Tuesday, bringing him total to 415. Santorum has 176, Gingrich, 105 and Paul, 47. Exit polls showed voters split between those who regarded Romney as the more electable in a one-to-one with Obama and those conservatives who do not view Romney as a \"a true conservative\" or having \"a strong moral character.",

      "bodyText": "Arnold Schwarzenegger and Europe's climate chief, Connie Hedegaard, are spearheading a new push to help people envisage a sustainable future using low-carbon resources. The Sustainia initiative, launched on Wednesday with the support of the United Nations global compact, aims to take dozens of new and developing technologies from renewable energy to hydrogen-powered buses, and use designers to create visual representations and recreations that will allow people to imagine what a more environmentally friendly world would be like. This is needed in order to allay people's fears that opting for more environmentally sustainable practices may lead to a lower quality of life, according to the founders. \"We've done this because it is hard for people to understand what a sustainable future could look like,\" Hedegaard told the Guardian. \"Many people do not want to give up what they know because they fear that if we get away from business as usual, we will go to a grey and uninteresting life. But we can show that doesn't have to be \u2013 we can create cities where there is cleaner air, where people have better transport and nice houses to live in. Showing that vision is very important.\" The initiative is aimed at the Rio+20 conference this June, where governments, businesses and civil society will discuss ways to encourage environmental sustainability. The theme of the Rio+20 conference is \"the future we want\", and Sustainia is meant to allow people to envisage what such a future would look like. As well as creating a virtual model of a future sustainable world, and publishing a book laying out what that world will look like, the organisers of Sustainia will set up an award they are billing as a \"Nobel prize for sustainable development\". It will reward technological breakthroughs and designs that tackle environmental problems. Schwarzenegger said: \"Being a champion in body building, in movies and in politics where I was able to lead California to renewable energy, energy efficiency, green jobs \u2026 I believe it is important to demonstrate that sustainability is the better choice for all of us. For communities around the world and for the individual, the Sustainia award offers a multitude of benefits in terms of better health, more liveable regions and cities and increased productivity. But we need to actually see it to understand it. And this is what we will make possible.\" The head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Rajendra Pachauri, and Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former politician, many regard as the founder of environmental sustainability thinking, after she coined the definition of sustainability at the first Rio conference 20 years ago, are also taking part in Sustainia. Businesses are also involved, including Microsoft, General Electric, Philips and TetraPak. Georg Kell, executive director of the UN Global Compact, said: \"Sustainia is a clear articulation of the future we want\" and aligns well with the message the UN wants to convey in Rio and beyond: we can build a desirable, sustainable future. Sustainia is a fresh and much-needed approach to communicating sustainability, engaging key stakeholders, and inspiring tangible action.\"",

But we need to actually see it to understand it. And this is what we will make possible.\"</p> <p>The head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Rajendra Pachauri, and Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former politician, many regard as the founder of environmental sustainability thinking, after she coined the definition of sustainability at the first Rio conference 20 years ago, are also taking part in Sustainia.</p> <p>Businesses are also involved, including Microsoft, General Electric, Philips and TetraPak.</p> <p>Georg Kell, executive director of the UN Global Compact, said: \"Sustainia is a clear articulation of the future we want\" and aligns well with the message the UN wants to convey in Rio and beyond: we can build a desirable, sustainable future. Sustainia is a fresh and much-needed approach to communicating sustainability, engaging key stakeholders, and inspiring tangible action.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Girl Gone Wild After the relative failure of the album's first single Give Me All Your Luvin' \u2013 in with a bullet at No 37 in the UK \u2013 this throbbing, having-a-bit-of-a-dance electro-pop stomper was released a few weeks ago in the form of a fairly embarrassing lyric video. Embarrassing because the lyrics are probably the worst thing about it, all \"you got me in the zone, DJ play my favourite song\" club LOLs. Co-produced by Italian DJ Benny Benassi, it's a lot more exciting musically, especially when the whole thing disintegrates in the middle eight, dropping out completely as Madonna coos \"forgive me\". A signal we're back in Confessions on a Dance Floor territory following the relative misstep of Hard Candy. Gang Bang Madonna in playful mode. Big throbbing industrial-tinged beats, spoken word verses, no real chorus, just a ridiculous collection of sound effects (police sirens, gunshots) and imposing menace that's actually pretty fun in a kind of slightly unhinged way. Gang Bang recalls her American Life album in its slightly uneasy marrying of genres, with a sudden dubstep breakdown its most obvious detour. Lyrically it's a twisted revenge fantasy rather than a sordid romp, closing with the line: \"If you're going to drive like a bitch then you're going to die like a bitch.\" I'm Addicted Again co-produced by Benny Benassi, this continues the theme of \"Fun!\" (however forced it might seem) that permeates most of MDNA's first half. \"I need to dance,\" Madonna trills over squiggly synth squelches and a beat that morphs into a fairly ridiculous Calvin Harris-esque breakdown. By the end she's chanting \"M D N A\", which you imagine might be shouted back at her by some fairly large crowds come summer. Turn Up the Radio This one, co-produced by Martin Solveig, should have been the second single. Its relatively calm intro is a timely breather from the throbbing bass and feels more carefree and instinctive than what has gone before. Over a bouncing beat that filters, stutters and drops in all the right places, it slowly morphs into an anthemic raveathon, with a lovely middle eight underpinned by almost tribal drums. Again, the theme is the need for one and all to chill out and have some fun. Give Me All Your Luvin' feat Nicki Minaj and MIA If you were one of the 108 million people who watched this year's Super Bowl halftime show then you've probably heard this first single. If, however, you listen to the radio then you probably haven't, seeing as it wasn't playlisted on Radio 1 and received limited exposure elsewhere. Though admittedly not her best comeback single \u2013 that's Frozen, in case you were wondering \u2013 it's still a fun song, Solveig slightly reworking the bouncing beats and acoustic strums of his amazing Hello single and drafting in Nicki Minaj and MIA to add some personality to a middle section that's slightly dubstep-interlude-by-numbers. Some Girls Probably the album's weakest moment, with Madonna's vocals pulled, processed and buried deep in the mix, acting more like another instrument within a deluge of filtered beats. It could have easily been a leftover from her Music album, William Orbit unable to find a melodic core in a song that probably should have been included as a bonus track. Superstar Opening with a massive Cheerleader-style drum beat \u2013 reminiscent of the extended intro to Solveig's Hello \u2013 this is much better, Madonna sounding playful and energised, singing about how her new boyfriend is pretty amazing. In fact, she likes him so much she'll let him \"have the password to my phone\". Unfortunately, as with most songs on the first half of the album, the chorus is a bit weak, a simple \"oh la la, you're my superstar\". Also, memo to Madonna: massive pop stars knowing about dubstep is probably a bit old hat now, but we get another dubstepesque breakdown nonetheless. I Don't Give a feat Nicki Minaj Brilliantly odd. Opening with a bang, literally, it goes on to morph into an America Life-style rap (no wait, come back) that features a list of things Madonna has to do (\"meet the press \u2026 sign the contract\"). The industrial beats soon make way for spooky chants and out of nowhere Minaj pops up, finishing her rap with \"there's only one Queen and that's Madonna, bitch\". If this isn't being made into a T-shirt as you read this then there's something wrong with the world of merchandise. I'm a Sinner Futuristic-sounding, double-tracked beats hail a song that veers from having fun on a night out (\"all the boys and the girls wanna be like us tonight\"), to a religious revelry (\"Hail Mary, Jesus Christ on the cross died for our sins\"). Produced by William Orbit, his signature motifs are all over it, from the Ray of Light-style guitar line that emerges from nowhere to the bit later on that sounds like Beautiful Stranger. Love Spent Back come the guitars, this time working around processed strings, a pretty melody and lyrics about wanting to replace money in a man's affections. \"Hold me like your money \u2026 Spend your love on me,\" Madonna sings over four-to-the-floor beats and a properly ravey middle eight. There's an amusing moment when she deadpans: \"Frankly, if my name was Benjamin, we wouldn't be in this mess we're in.\" Masterpiece Over a simple fingerclick drum beat and a pretty acoustic riff, this ballad \u2013 which appeared on the W.E. soundtrack \u2013 takes the painting metaphor hinted at in the title and runs with it. \"If you were the Mona Lisa, you'd be hanging in the Louvre,\" Madonna sings, with the implication being that it's hard to love something perfect and distant (\"the look but please don't touch me type\"). It's one of the best vocal performances on the album, her voice soft and sweet throughout, lifting effortlessly into the chorus of \"I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night, I stand in front of the masterpiece.\" A breath of fresh air after heavy bass and ravey synths. Falling Free Opens with a spooky, slightly unhinged piano section that's more lonely woman in haunted house than Coldplay stadium filler. Deep strings underpin the whole thing, with just the piano and strange electronic textures \u2013 similar to Ray of Light's Drowned World \u2013 for company. As with most of the later songs, you could easily read a lot into the lyrics, specifically thinking about Madonna's divorce from Guy Ritchie. \"We're both free, free to go,\" she sings as the strings sigh and slowly settle. It's a haunting way to end the main album. Beautiful Killer The first of four bonus tracks, this draws on a fairly popular Madonna theme: that of being drawn to something bad for you. \"Baby I'll let you shoot me down\" and \"I can't really talk with a gun in my mouth\" are two lyrical highlights on a song that was rightly left off the main album. I Fucked Up This, however, definitely should have been on it. Opening with a big, bass-heavy beat and a snapped \"I fucked up\", it's Madonna at her self-lacerating best. \"I made a mistake, nobody does it better than myself,\" she sings as the beat is joined by strings and sudden bursts of guitar. Suddenly the beat skips and speeds up, creating the album's grimiest, least polished moment. Fans of Confessions on a Dance Floor's Sorry will be pleased to hear her sing \"je suis desol\u00e9\" in the least convincing French accent. B-Day Song feat MIA Rumours that this MIA collaboration was bumped from the main tracklisting following middlefingergate were not confirmed during the playback, but it's more than likely it was left off because it's Motown/Spectorish beat doesn't really fit with the rest of the album. It's a jolly romp though, with MIA joining in on the chorus but letting Madonna deliver the line \"give me a spanking, start the day off right\" by herself. Best Friend A real highlight. With a massive electro beat that pogos all over the place, this is a brilliant rush of darting synths. Lyrically it's about a relationship that should never have been, Madonna lamenting the loss of a friendship after things went wrong. There are nods, perhaps, to her previous life as part of the English gentry \u2013 \"I miss the countryside in which we used to lay\" \u2013 and it's one of the few times on the album where the chorus truly soars. It ends with the line \"it's so sad that it had to end\" and, generally, this is true of Madonna's MDNA, an album that's been trailed by weak singles, but contains brilliantly bonkers moments.",

      "bodyText": "The transformation of mobile phones into wallets could come as early as this summer after the UK's three largest networks submitted plans to Brussels for a joint venture they hope will allow them to make money from the technology in Europe. Vodafone, O2 and Everything Everywhere, which owns T-Mobile and Orange, have applied to the European commissionto form a company that would create a mobile wallet platform and an advertising sales house that could reach every subscriber on their networks. The project is designed to pitch telecoms groups against the likes of Google, Apple and Facebook, with all of them hoping to use \"data mining\" - amassing detailed information on the finances, consumption habits, location and demographics of customers - to create new forms of highly targeted advertising and services. \"If approved, the joint venture will benefit UK plc as a whole,\" the partners said in a statement. \"It will promote competition by bringing together the necessary scale to offer a credible alternative to the established online payments and advertising platforms offered by large US-based internet players.\" Customers would be able to store debit and credit card details on their phones and pay for goods or transport either online via their mobile or by tapping the handset on a special reader at the till or ticket barrier, using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. They could also receive coupons from advertisers, sent to their phones and redeemed in shops and venues, in exchange for sharing personal information. The joint venture, codenamed Project Oscar and announced last summer but until now stalled in negotiations between the partners and the commission, would be the first of its kind in Europe. Project Oscar represents an attempt to shape the future of a key mobile technology, which is already being piloted in the United States, with Google Wallet having moved to a public trial late last year. Google had been hoping to bring its wallet to the UK this year, but has yet to do so. The service will be open to all users on \"terms which do not discriminate between them and the companies funding the joint venture\". The wallet technology will be open to any bank, to virtual mobile networks such as Virgin Mobile or Tesco Mobile, and to retailers and transport companies. Companies will be charged a fee to use the service, but the owners will not levy commission on individual transactions such as card payments. If approval is granted, the backers, which will own exactly a third of the venture each, are planning to launch their first services this summer. They will invest tens of millions in Oscar, forming a stand-alone business that would be based in London and create new jobs as well as absorbing staff from the partner companies. The EC's competition directorate received the application on Monday night and has 25 days to either agree, require amendments or extend its investigation. The Office of Fair Trading could also ask for the application to be referred back to the UK. It may be pressed to do so by 3, the smallest UK network, which has been left out of the joint venture. 3 has around 10% of UK mobile subscribers and was offered a stake in line with its market share before Christmas, but negotiations stalled. It has already complained about Oscar to the commission. Stephen Lerner, regulatory affairs director at 3, said: \"The proposed joint venture should not be permitted in its current form. It will control and sell access to over 90% of UK mobile subscribers and their data thus allowing [the partners] to neatly do away with the inconvenience of competing with each other.\" The use of confidential information is also likely to be a source of controversy. Google is already being challenged by European watchdogs over its newly revised privacy policy. A spokesperson for the venture said consumer protection would be a matter for individual networks, because Oscar would not have a direct relationship with customers. It has no plans to issue privacy guidelines, such as whether customers will be automatically opted in to mobile advertising unless they actively reject it.",

      "bodyText": "The collapsed US bank Lehman Brothers has committed itself to cashing in its stake in Formula One motor racing within two years, according to documents released as part of the ongoing unwinding of the company. The stake is expected to yield a $1.5bn (\u00a3950m) payout to Lehman's creditors, who are owed $450bn. Lehman's estate has emerged from bankruptcy protection and confirmed that its first payment to creditors, which include hedge funds, money managers and businesses, will be made in April. It is expected to exceed $10bn and in total creditors will get around $65bn. Other assets that could be sold are a hotel in Hawaii, a Rockies ski resort and a Manhattan boutique hotel. Lehman is the second-biggest shareholder in Formula One's Jersey-based holding company, Delta Topco, which is majority-owned by private equity firm CVC. Lehman owns a 15.3% stake and a senior Formula One source says that Topco is worth \"more than $10bn\". A sale could open the door to new investors in Formula One, which has been a subject of much discussion in the past year. In April, the media group News Corporation said it was considering a bid with the Italian firm Exor. Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and the world's richest man, Carlos Slim, were also believed to be interested and in November Formula One's chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, said he had been advised to float the business in Singapore rather than sell it. Lehman's $639bn bankruptcy remains the largest in US history and marked the demise of a company that had survived the Civil War and the Depression. Lehman said it had already raised $30bn since its 2008 collapse. It has sold its stake in the Manhattan property known as the International Toy Centre, which once housed toy makers from around the world, and Whistler Blackcomb, a Canadian ski resort that was one of the venues for the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. The bank says it stands to raise $35bn more by selling the rest of its assets, which include the 404-room Ritz Carlton Kapalua in Hawaii and the Moonlight Basin in Montana, a luxurious ski, golf and spa resort. Lehman first became a Formula One shareholder in 2002 when it took over a stake held by German media company Kirch after it defaulted on a loan from the bank. Lehman sold this to CVC in 2006, but then reinvested and provided $550m of a $2.8bn loan which the private equity firm used to buy the sport. When Lehman went bust in September 2008, CVC attempted to seize its Formula One shares, as Topco's articles of association give it the power to force any shareholder which becomes insolvent to sell for a fair price. Lehman objected on the grounds that its stake would be worth more if it was sold as part of a controlling interest in the sport. CVC agreed and allowed it to move its shares and right to repayment of the debt from its bankrupt arm Lehman Commercial Paper into LBI Group, a new holding company containing valuable assets. LBI's purpose is to generate cash from these assets and pay Lehman's creditors. This is continuing and dissolving the firm completely depends on settling the claims from creditors. To ensure that the Formula One stake raises funds for Lehman's creditors, LBI has committed itself to paying Lehman Commercial Paper an amount equal to the market value of the shares if it has not sold them within two years. The documents state that \"if, on June 30, 2014, [LBI Group] has not disposed of all of the Formula One assets, then [Lehman Commercial Paper] may, at any time thereafter demand that [LBI Group] pay to [Lehman Commercial Paper] an amount equal to the fair value of the Formula One assets.\" Topco's shareholders are bound by an agreement which gives CVC a veto over the sale of any stakes in the company. However, when it requested the transfer of the Formula One shares to LBI, Lehman argued that US bankruptcy law would overrule its obligation to CVC. This claim was never tested in court, so unless Lehman uses it again and is successful, it means CVC still holds the keys as to who will be the future owner of Formula One.",

With Democracy still to come, it is already possible to reassess individual plays, dwell on production methods and delight in Frayn's skill in drawing philosophical meanings out of domestic or historical crises. Not having seen Benefactors since its 1984 premiere, I had forgotten just how rich a play it is. On one level, it reminds us of the way architectural ideals are compromised by economic realities. We watch, with amused dismay, as the principled David is forced by town planners to turn a south London development project, modelled on collegiate quadrangles, into a high-rise monstrosity. It's a subject of particular relevance in Sheffield where the Parkhill estate became a blot on the landscape; but Frayn also reminds us of the way just about every British city has suffered from brutalist, skyscraping follies. Frayn's play is even more lethal when it exposes the failure of good intentions on the private level. David and Jane are a kindly, successful couple who can't do enough for their neighbours, the cynical Colin and the disorganised Sheila. What they don't realise is that, in welcoming them into their home, they are sowing the seeds of their own destruction. The result is a devastating attack on the fallibility of liberal altruism that reminded me of Max Frisch's The Fire Raisers, in which a hapless bourgeois shows similar hospitality towards a pair of palpable arsonists. Smoothly directed by Charlotte Gwinner, and impeccably acted by Simon Wilson and Abigail Cruttenden as the genial hosts and Andrew Woodall and Rebecca Lacey as the dependent visitors, this is a major act of reclamation. Copenhagen, first seen in 1998, is an even greater play in that it deals with a more momentous issue: what took place in 1941 when Werner Heisenberg, the potential father of a German atomic bomb, visited his mentor and former colleague, Niels Bohr, in occupied Denmark. Was Heisenberg seeking information, absolution or endorsement? We are never quite sure. But Frayn uses this historic uncertainty to create a deeply moving meditation on memory, scientific morality and the difficulty of ever knowing either our own or other people's motives. Part of the play's effect depends on the merging of theme and form, with the actors orbiting the stage like electrons, neutrons and protons. But for that you need a clear, well-lit space whereas, in David Grindley's production, Jonathan Fensom's design thrusts the actors upstage in a quasi-realistic house and the lighting puts faces in shadow at key moments. Fortunately, Henry Goodman as Bohr, Geoffrey Streatfeild as Heisenberg and Barbara Flynn as Bohr's inquisitive wife, Margrethe, deliver Frayn's text with exemplary clarity and remind us of his extraordinary capacity to combine nuclear physics with metaphysical speculation on life's mystery.",

      "bodyText": "I can't remember the last time one of the NDT companies made me laugh out loud. During the three decades or so in which they were collectively dominated by the work of Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n, even the most exhilarating dance material tended to have an undertow of puzzled angst. But while Kyli\u00e1n's influence persists, there's a new kid on the NDT block: recently appointed associate choreographer Alexander Ekman. His 2010 work Cacti has a party spirit that celebrates the youthful prowess of NDT2's dancers (all aged between 17 and 23). Mass ensemble numbers, sharply illuminated, reference the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony, while deploying an irreverent mix of martial arts, sports, hand-jiving and voguing. The movement is orchestrated around an installation of gleaming white squares, which turn from standing plinths into geometric sculpture. A number of cacti also make an appearance. The whip-smart timing of this piece as it juggles these incongruous elements is pure pleasure. The central duet, in which the dancers' taped voices comment ironically on what they're doing (\"Look out for my head,\" mutters one as the other swivels him) is a masterclass in pacing and pitch. Running through certain sections is a recorded commentary that muses on the work's possible meanings. A postmodern joke on postmodernism, it is silly, clever and knowing. It would be intriguing to hear a choreographer's commentary on the evening's other two works. Passe-Partout, by Paul Lightfoot and Sol Le\u00f3n, has six dancers moving gravely between a series of sliding doors, their large and beautiful dance shapes shaken by sudden spasms and the occasional guttural shout. In Kyli\u00e1n's Gods and Dogs, the internal twitchy madness of the central dancer is framed by looming shadows, a nightmarish video of a hunting dog. There are unsettling and exquisite images in each work, yet both fail to cohere into compelling dance visions.",

It was effectively a musical mosaic: several short chamber works in turn made up of several small sections. Yet the programme never seemed bitty, testament to the integrity of composer John Woolrich's curation. His principal connecting thread was that of portraits \u2013 some living tributes, some memorialising, all in quite philosophical vein and played with much artistry by the BCMG players. Henry Purcell was the subject of two homages: Oliver Knussen's shadowy Upon One Note and Gerald Barry's quirky Aeneas and Dido. Luciano Berio's Duetti for Two Violins were vivid portraits of friends, with the intimacy and give-and-take of friendship implicit in their fabric. Peter Maxwell Davies's reflective Unbroken Circle was a tribute to William Glock, but more affecting was Woolrich's own In the Mirrors of Asleep, an elegy for a friend who died young. Taking its title from an Anne Stevenson poem, the quartet evokes the fractured world of dream, alternately wistful and playful, with the aching sadness of the final piano chords akin to the moment of waking and the realisation it brings. Aldo Clementi's Berceuse was similarly moving for being less about the cradle than the grave. Philip Cashian's Caprichos is named for Goya's aquatint prints observing the folly of Spanish society in the 18th century; the music's sharply etched lines are a dark and troubled commentary on the present, with only the serene, high violin line offering any hope. Finally, the portrayals in Thomas Ad\u00e8s's Court Studies, from his opera The Tempest, had an immediacy which underlined that while time passes, human nature changes not at all.",

His choice: 18 months in a neck brace, or radical surgery that might cure him \u2013 or kill him. Sturrock has already told some of the story in Frankenspine: My Big Break, but this solo show is more than merely a terrier returning to worry a bone. Like the title itself, which evokes the emergency distress call as well as the pagan fertility rites of Padstow as it marks the moment when winter darkness turns to summer, the show constantly offers up double meanings as it plays with the ideas of performance itself. With its dressing-room setting, it begins by reminding us that this is a performance as well as a true story, and there are witty little reminders throughout. The dressing-room mirror stands in stark contrast to the mirror that becomes the only method for the paralysed Sturrock to view the world. A hospital screen doubles as red velvet curtains. The surgeon who performs on Sturrock does so with an operatic flourish as he screws in titanium bolts. The show is at its best when it just tells the story, rather than attempting to impose meanings upon it. References to Icarus, or a sentimental goodbye in the hospital, work less well than Sturrock seeing the scan of his unborn baby \u2013 with a tiny and perfect spine \u2013 pinned to the ceiling above his head. By the end, you're not just clapping Sturrock's survival (though there is an element of that) but a piece of theatre that jauntily celebrates a break with the past and the chance of a new beginning.",

It's exciting.\" Watching the slick musician move between violin, guitar and glockenspiel and carefully layer crisp loops of sound, it's impossible to imagine Bird relying on anything other than pure passion to guide him through the depths of his musically rich songs. His three bandmates reverently watch as he moves back and forth upon a square of suitably regal red carpet, each as attuned to expecting the unexpected as the loyal audience. Still, Bird surprises with a setlist restricted to his latest album, Break It Yourself. \"It seems fitting,\" he says \u2013 and in keeping, too, with the new directness the Chicago-born Bird has discovered with his sixth solo release. Although Bird hasn't completely abandoned his usual lyrical obscurity, the likes of Lazy Projector are unabashed in their sentiment. \"I can't see the sense in us breaking up at all,\" Bird sings, his usually smooth voice cracking. If fans are disappointed by the choice of material, they hide it well. Near Death Experience Experience is welcomed like an old favourite, despite his faltering falsetto. So, too, is the haunting, cymbal-adorned Lusitania, which glistens like sunshine on a gently lapping tide. The restless rhythms and infectious melodies of Eyeoneye and Danse Carribe maintain the audience's rapt attention, and their patience is rewarded by a dip into Bird's rockier past with Plasticities and Tables and Chairs. It is to country and blues that Bird turns, however, for a startling encore featuring The Handsome Family's So Much Wine and Charley Patton's I'm Goin' Home, his sound stripped back but thrilling as ever.

This is seen again in '2', although the angle seems awkward. '3' shows the spire of the iconic St Pauls church in London dissected by a window of a bus, it works well. The glass dulls the colours and the composition is stunning. In '4' the use of text is distracting, perhaps you could've blurred this a bit more by using a shorter depth of field. The last two, photographed in black and white, show more buildings with reflections in the glass. '5' is more successful than '6', but this portfolio seems to lack a general theme linking the images together - and using black and white together with colour hasn't helped this. Each of the images in the set need to be as strong in composition as '3'</em>",

I will leave Colts with nothing but good thoughts and gratitude,\" said Manning. Colts owner Jim Irsay, who announced that Manning's Number 18 jersey would be retired by the team, and Manning were close to tears throughout the event. Although Manning revealed nothing of his future playing plans, he did say: \"I don't want to retire. I don't feel I have anything to prove. I still want to play. Nobody loves playing quarterback more than I do. This is uncharted territory for me. I haven't thought a lot about where I will play, but I have thought a lot about where I've been.\" The pair said the decision to allow Manning to leave the team \"has never been about the money\". Irsay and Manning said they had many conversations before reaching the decision: \"Circumstances were the third guy in the talks. It was not my decision or Jim's decision. It was circumstances.\" Irsay talked about the club's need to rebuild after its poor record last season (the worst in the NFL) and how much room for maneouvre it had in that process with the salary cap. Manning, who will turn 36 this month, missed the entire 2011 season after a third neck surgery. Before that, however, he had never missed a game in his previous 13 seasons with the Colts, the only pro team he has played for. He is the Colts' career leader in every major passing category, is one of only four players in league history to throw for more than 50,000 yards and is third all-time in touchdown passes (399). The Colts are expected to sign Stanford QB Andrew Luck as Manning's replacement in the 2012 draft. Manning meanwhile will very shortly officially become a free agent. He is sure to interest many suitors: the Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins, Cleveland Browns, Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs have all been touted as realistic contenders for his signature. His decision is likely to be based upon which team has the most realistic chance of helping him win another Super Bowl ring. He will, however, have to prove his fitness after missing the whole of the 2011 season after three neck surgeries. Irsay said: \"We are blessed to have gone through experiences together...from when a 37-year-old owner met a 22-year-old player. This is a difficult day, a shared pain.\" A tearful Manning said: \"This city has been great for me. It is still a huge part of my life.\" He added: \"We have to keep this in perspective...compared to the tornado victims in Indiana and Tennessee.\"",

Unlike her son Rahul, who took the rap on Tuesday for the party's failure in Uttar Pradesh, the largest and politically the most crucial state, Gandhi, at an impromptu press conference, dismissed the drubbing the Congress party received. \"It's not the first time it's happened \u2013 people were not happy with the sitting legislators,\" she said on Wednesday, when asked why all five Congress party candidates to the UP assembly had lost in Gandhi's own parliamentary constituency and only two of the five candidates in Rahul's constituency managing to win. Both Rahul and his sister Priyanka had campaigned hard in the two districts the family views as its fiefdom, and Priyanka, playfully tweaking her mother's cheek at an election rally, had even promised her \"10 out of 10\" assembly seats. Analysts maintain that unless some top leaders pay for the poll setback, there is little hope for the party, presently ruling in Delhi as it prepares for the general elections in 2014. But Congress-watchers say that's not how Gandhi's highly centralised party functions. \"People at the state level will be pulled up, the leaders at the centre will go scot free,\" said Headline Today TV's Durga Nandini. Gandhi said she did not think a popular movement against corruption in government had targeted her party but in Goa, in a never-before phenomenon, several powerful but notoriously corrupt Congress leaders were trounced in Catholic-dominated constituencies by the Hindu rightwing BJP party. Gandhi said inflation may have had some influence on the result and it is very likely that party supporters' loyalty has been severely tested by a couple of years of rising food prices. The number of women voters, those who are the biggest victims of food inflation, since they manage the kitchens, went up 43%.",

      "bodyText": "Once again, Evil Scientists have thwarted a plan by those vile Creationists to take over the world. Creation Science and its more moderate offspring, Intelligent Design (ID), have never been taken seriously by scientists. This is because most of the actual science is poor, and in ID, at least, is never about the designer. Because of this, ID's supporters have difficulty publishing in the scientific literature, so they have to resort to other methods of getting their message out, like starting their own journal. Their latest ruse is to hold a conference and publish a book of conference proceedings. This all unravelled last week when someone noticed. A long time ID watcher known online as \"sparc\" saw that the German publishers, Springer-Verlag, announced a book edited with the title Biological Information: New Perspectives. The editors of the book were well known names: Robert Marks II, Michael Behe, William Dembski, Bruce Gordon, and John Sanford. Despite clearly being an ID book (more on that below), it was being published in the \"Intelligent Systems Reference Library\" series in Engineering and Applied Science, i.e., not in biology. The more cynical (sensu Sir Humphrey) suspected this was an attempt to get the book through the Springer review process by sending it to an editor less likely to understand the context of the book and its proposal. The senior editor (Marks) is a computer scientist, who apparently is well respected in his field, and it may be that his reputation helped steer the book proposal through the publisher. After some digging around by ID watchers, the following story has emerged. The book is a collection of papers presented at a meeting held on the campus of Cornell University, in the School of Hotel Administration(!). About 120 people were invited, including roughly 27 speakers. Presumably this was arranged by John Sanford, who is a \"courtesy professor\" at Cornell (meaning, he was a professor, but retired in 1998, evidently to spend more time with his gene gun). But what is the book about? This is how the book's blurb described it: In the spring of 2011, a diverse group of scientists gathered at Cornell University to discuss their research into the nature and origin of biological information. This symposium brought together experts in information theory, computer science, numerical simulation, thermodynamics, evolutionary theory, whole organism biology, developmental biology, molecular biology, genetics, physics, biophysics, mathematics, and linguistics. This volume presents new research by those invited to speak at the conference. The contributors to this volume use their wide-ranging expertise in the area of biological information to bring fresh insights into the explanatory difficulties that biological information raises. Going beyond the conventional scientific wisdom, which attempts to explain biological information reductionistically via chemical, genetic, and natural selective determinants, the work represented here develops novel non-reductionist approaches to biological information, looking notably to telic [sic] and self-organizational [sic] processes. Several clear themes emerged from these research papers: 1) Information is indispensable to our understanding of what life is. 2) Biological information is more than the material structures that embody it. 3) Conventional chemical and evolutionary mechanisms seem insufficient to fully explain the labyrinth of information that is life. By exploring new perspectives on biological information, this volume seeks to expand, encourage, and enrich research on the nature and origin of biological information. The clear themes sound pretty much like biology to me, only loosely linked to intelligent systems. It also differs somewhat from how the meeting was described by its organiser, John Sandford (starting at 30:08 here, transcribed by me): Well, it turns out that Darwin's theory is coming down. And there was a really exciting symposium at Cornell organised by myself and some associates, and it was entitled 'Biological Information: New Perspectives'. And basically it was over 120 people gathered, about half of them PhDs, 25 speakers were PhD scientists [who] talked about the reality [of] number 1: biological information in living systems is astounding, wonderful, beautifully [?] and wonderfully made and number 2: it is coming undone. And this conference had people from every field, from physicists, bio-physicists, chemists, biochemists, mathematicians, geneticists, molecular biologists, computer scientists. All these people came together. We were agreed one one thing, and that is that Darwin was wrong. So \"Darwin was wrong\" somehow is transmuted into \"conventional chemical and evolutionary mechanisms seem insufficient to fully explain the labyrinth of information that is life\" (this is Science Communication [tm] at its finest). An analysis of the titles of the talks at the meeting definitely identified co-authors for 10 of the chapters in the book, and provide good guesses for the identities for 10 more authors. Almost all are either YECs, young earth creationists (Sanford is a YEC), or part of the ID crowd, associated with the Discovery Institute in Seattle. The titles suggest the usual creationist nonsense, claiming that evolution can't create the complexity we see (but remaining almost uniformly silent on how this complexity arose). As the contents of the volume are the typical ID/creationist subjects, how did this book get accepted by Springer-Verlag? Presumably the proposal to have the book published didn't mention ID (nor creationism), but what did it say? Presumably, it would have been more detailed than the book's blurb, and would probably have listed the proposed chapters and authors. I think this would have been spotted rather quickly by biologists, so sending the proposal to an engineering/computer science editor makes sense. But who were the reviewers? Marks II &amp; co. would have provided some suggestions (presumably their friends), but did Springer ask anyone else? And did they query the book's suitability for their Intelligent Systems section? A couple of days after the book was noticed, the announcement on Springer's webpages disappeared. The editors decided that \"additional peer review would be necessary\", according to their executive vice president of corporate communications, which sounds like there was a collective \"oh bugger\" when Springer realised their mistake, so they've bought themselves some time to sort out the mess. Of course, this may not mean that they won't publish the book anyway: they may decide that the extra sales to creationists is worth the hit to their credibility (especially if they reduce the price from the $179 it was originally listed for). This would also avoid the inevitable accusations of suppression of creationist viewpoints, recriminations that don't impress proper scientists. Perhaps Springer may try to have the best of both worlds by publishing it in their Design section, alongside titles like Functional Aesthetics, Emergency Design, and Max von Moos' Surrealistic Depiction of War [Das surrealistische Kriegsbild bei Max von Moos]. This is just the latest chapter in the normal fun-and-games saga that is the ID circus. But, bizarrely, the ID crowd hasn't come out to play this time. Since the withdrawal of the book announcement, all that we've seen has been a couple quotes in an article online, and a post on the Discovery Institute's blog, which was quickly taken down. This is surprising, as the Disco Institute is usually quick to leap up and down complaining that they're being oppressed. So why has there barely been a peep out of them? Don't they care any more? Are they too busy doing more Sooper Top Seekrit Science? Or are they being oppressed by their lawyers? .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

A long time ID watcher known online as \"sparc\" saw that the German publishers, Springer-Verlag, announced a book edited with the title <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/engineering/computational+intelligence+and+complexity/book/978-3-642-28453-3\"><em>Biological Information: New Perspectives</em></a>. The editors of the book were well known names: Robert Marks II, Michael Behe, William Dembski, Bruce Gordon, and John Sanford. Despite clearly being an ID book (more on that below), it was being published in the \"Intelligent Systems Reference Library\" series in Engineering and Applied Science, i.e., not in biology. The more cynical (<em>sensu</em> <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Yes,_Minister#Episode_Four:_The_Moral_Dimension\">Sir Humphrey</a>) suspected this was an attempt to get the book through the Springer review process by sending it to an editor less likely to understand the context of the book and its proposal. The senior editor (Marks) is a computer scientist, who apparently is well respected in his field, and it may be that his reputation helped steer the book proposal through the publisher. </p> <p>After some digging around by ID watchers, the following story has emerged. The book is a collection of papers presented at a meeting held on the campus of Cornell University, in the School of Hotel Administration(!). About 120 people were invited, including roughly 27 speakers. Presumably this was arranged by John Sanford, who is a \"courtesy professor\" at Cornell (meaning, he <em>was</em> a professor, but retired in 1998, evidently to spend more time with his gene gun).</p> <p>But what is the book about? This is how the book's blurb described it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the spring of 2011, a diverse group of scientists gathered at Cornell University to discuss their research into the nature and origin of biological information. This symposium brought together experts in information theory, computer science, numerical simulation, thermodynamics, evolutionary theory, whole organism biology, developmental biology, molecular biology, genetics, physics, biophysics, mathematics, and linguistics. This volume presents new research by those invited to speak at the conference.</p> <p>The contributors to this volume use their wide-ranging expertise in the area of biological information to bring fresh insights into the explanatory difficulties that biological information raises. Going beyond the conventional scientific wisdom, which attempts to explain biological information reductionistically via chemical, genetic, and natural selective determinants, the work represented here develops novel non-reductionist approaches to biological information, looking notably to telic [<em>sic</em>] and self-organizational [<em>sic</em>] processes.</p> <p>Several clear themes emerged from these research papers: 1) Information is indispensable to our understanding of what life is. 2) Biological information is more than the material structures that embody it. 3) Conventional chemical and evolutionary mechanisms seem insufficient to fully explain the labyrinth of information that is life. By exploring new perspectives on biological information, this volume seeks to expand, encourage, and enrich research on the nature and origin of biological information.</p> </blockquote> <p>The clear themes sound pretty much like biology to me, only loosely linked to intelligent systems. It also differs somewhat from how the meeting was described by its organiser, John Sandford (starting at 30:08 <a href=\"http://youtu.be/_edD5HOx6Q0\">here</a>, transcribed by me):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it turns out that Darwin's theory is coming down. And there was a really exciting symposium at Cornell organised by myself and some associates, and it was entitled 'Biological Information: New Perspectives'. And basically it was over 120 people gathered, about half of them PhDs, 25 speakers were PhD scientists [who] talked about the reality [of] number 1: biological information in living systems is astounding, wonderful, beautifully [?] and wonderfully made and number 2: it is coming undone. And this conference had people from every field, from physicists, bio-physicists, chemists, biochemists, mathematicians, geneticists, molecular biologists, computer scientists. All these people came together. We were agreed one one thing, and that is that Darwin was wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>So \"Darwin was wrong\" somehow is transmuted into \"conventional chemical and evolutionary mechanisms seem insufficient to fully explain the labyrinth of information that is life\" (this is Science Communication [tm] at its finest). An analysis of the titles of the talks at the meeting definitely identified co-authors for 10 of the chapters in the book, and provide good guesses for the identities for 10 more authors. Almost all are either YECs, young earth creationists (Sanford is a YEC), or part of the ID crowd, associated with the Discovery Institute in Seattle. The titles suggest the usual creationist nonsense, claiming that evolution can't create the complexity we see (but remaining almost uniformly silent on how this complexity arose).</p> <p>As the contents of the volume are the typical ID/creationist subjects, how did this book get accepted by Springer-Verlag? Presumably the proposal to have the book published didn't mention ID (nor creationism), but what <em>did</em> it say? Presumably, it would have been more detailed than the book's blurb, and would probably have listed the proposed chapters and authors. I think this would have been spotted rather quickly by biologists, so sending the proposal to an engineering/computer science editor makes sense. But who were the reviewers? Marks II &amp; co. would have provided some suggestions (presumably their friends), but did Springer ask anyone else? And did they query the book's suitability for their Intelligent Systems section?</p> <p>A couple of days after the book was noticed, the announcement on Springer's webpages disappeared. The editors decided that \"additional peer review would be necessary\", according to their executive vice president of corporate communications, which sounds like there was a collective \"oh bugger\" when Springer realised their mistake, so they've bought themselves some time to sort out the mess. Of course, this may not mean that they won't publish the book anyway: they may decide that the extra sales to creationists is worth the hit to their credibility (especially if they reduce the price from the $179 <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Biological-Information-Perspectives-Intelligent-Reference/dp/3642284531\">it was originally listed for</a>). This would also avoid the inevitable accusations of suppression of creationist viewpoints, recriminations that don't impress proper scientists. Perhaps Springer may try to have the best of both worlds by publishing it in their <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/architecture+%26+design?SGWID=0-40360-12-659006-0\">Design section</a>, alongside titles like <em>Functional Aesthetics</em>, <em>Emergency Design</em>, and <em>Max von Moos' Surrealistic Depiction of War</em> [<em>Das surrealistische Kriegsbild bei Max von Moos</em>].</p> <p>This is just the latest chapter in the normal fun-and-games saga that is the ID circus. But, bizarrely, the ID crowd hasn't come out to play this time. Since the withdrawal of the book announcement, all that we've seen has been a couple quotes in an article online, and a post on the Discovery Institute's blog, which was quickly taken down. This is surprising, as the Disco Institute is usually quick to leap up and down complaining that they're being oppressed. So why has there barely been a peep out of them? Don't they care any more? Are they too busy doing more Sooper Top Seekrit Science? Or are they being oppressed by their lawyers?</p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>Thanks to the netizens at <a href=\"http://pandasthumb.org/\">The Panda's Thumb</a> and <a href=\"http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=4f5724c7499030a9;act=SF;f=14\">After the Bar Closes</a> for their research. </p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bik-f.de/root/index.php?page_id=219\">Bob O'Hara</a> is a biostatisician who conducts research at the <a href-\"http: www.isoe.de english projects bik_f.htm\">Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre</a> in Germany.

But more negotiations are needed before any final deportation deal that would at the minimum ensure that the radical Islamist cleric is returned to a British maximum security prison pending his forced return to Jordan. \"I have just returned from Jordan after constructive talks with the king and several ministers,\" said the home secretary. \"Those talks will now continue at an official level and build on the progress I made this week. The Jordanian government has been extremely helpful and will continue to be so. As everyone knows this is a complicated case that has lasted for a decade, but things are moving in a positive direction,\" said May. The home secretary met King Abdullah and the Jordanian prime minister, Awn Khasawneh, as well as other ministers. Qatada, who was once dubbed Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, has been released from Long Lartin maximum security prison and is living in north London under a 22-hour curfew and constant surveillance. His highly restrictive bail conditions will be lifted next month if \"demonstrable progress\" is not made in securing his deportation to Jordan. The 51-year-old radical Islamist cleric has been detained or under strict curfew as an international terror suspect in Britain for nearly nine years without trial or charge. He faces the prospect of a retrial for his involvement in two terror attacks more than 10 years ago in Amman for which he was convicted in absentia. The European court of human rights ruled in January that his deportation could not go ahead while he faced the prospect of a retrial based on evidence obtained by torture. The Strasbourg judges said that the use of torture and evidence obtained by torture was widespread and systemic in the Jordanian criminal justice system. The Jordanian state news agency, Petra, reported that Jordanian prime minister had also \"expressed satisfaction with progress made in cooperation between the two governments on the issue of Jordanian citizen Abu Qatada\". He did not elaborate on what developments there had been, but \"stressed the importance of continued co-ordination on this matter, in a way that respects the independence of judicial systems in Jordan and Britain.\" Amman has pledged that Abu Qatada would get a \"fair and transparent\" trial if London extradites him to the kingdom \"Jordan respects the rule of law as well as human rights. It has a judicial system that ensures fair trial of anybody on Jordanian territory,\" Khasawneh told May. The state news agency said that May had \"hailed Jordan's improvement in human rights\".",

      "bodyText": "For an organisation that is trying to be more inclusive, more involving, the name \"Barbican\" \u2013 a defensive structure, a fortification to keep the hordes out \u2013 is possibly not ideal. \"I say 'watchtower',\" the arts centre's chief executive, Sir Nicholas Kenyon, says when asked to define it. \"It is something that looks out on the city and beyond it.\" Whatever the definition, most people know what the Barbican centre is, where it is \u2013 and even how not to get lost there. That has not always been the case but, after many uphill battles, an awful lot of people now even love the place. On Thursday the Barbican will celebrate its 30th anniversary, entertaining guests in its enormous and unlikely tropical conservatory \u2013 with more than 2,000 species of plants and trees as well as finches, quails, terrapins and koi carp \u2013 before offering them the chance to sample a typically diverse range of artistic delights, whether a gig by country rockers the Jayhawks, Cheek by Jowl's sexy 'Tis Pity She's a Whore, or Terence Malick's film The Tree of Life. Kenyon, who ran the Proms for 11 years before taking over at the Barbican in 2007, is only its fourth overall boss after first Henry Wrong, who got the place built; then Detta O'Cathain, whose early 1990s tenure is seldom mentioned; and 12 years of John Tusa who, with his artistic director, Graham Sheffield, established it as a powerhouse of eclectic and internationalist commissioning. In 2012, Kenyon's priorities include scaling the Barbican's brutalist concrete ramparts: \"We want to be porous, we want to get beyond the walls and show that the arts that animate the Barbican can really serve the city as a whole. \"The issue for all arts centres is can they respond to the changing desire of the audience which, in our view, is to belong more, to have a sense of ownership and to participate more.\" Part of that is doing more in the local area of the City of London as well as moving east, forming partnerships in boroughs including Hackney and Tower Hamlets. Kenyon also wants to help create a cultural quarter on the centre's doorstep and in the autumn will open a new Barbican cinema just outside its main entrance. The centre's main screen will remain but the new cinema \u2013 with two 156-seat auditoria \u2013 replaces the two smaller screens in the centre, which few people could ever find. \"It will be a local cinema for the City and an international cinema for an arts centre,\" he says. The centre is also collaborating with the Guildhall schools in a new 650-seat concert venue on Silk Street. \"With those two buildings, you're starting to get the beginnings of a cultural quarter round here,\" said Kenyon. Kenyon accepts that the Barbican was built with \"a very defined idea of what the arts was \u2013 the old model of the arts being offered to the audience, 'We know what's good for you.'\" It has, though, turned out to be much more flexible than its designers could ever have imagined. The foyers in particular have proved ideal for more informal work and the centre was packed last Saturday and Sunday for two days of mostly free arts events at the Barbican Weekender. Like most arts organisations, the Barbican is having to operate with less money. Unlike most arts organisations, it gets little public money. The biggest chunk of its funding comes from the City: this year it amounts to \u00a317.3m \u2013 a 7% decrease. It is trying to cope with that by increasing box office and commercial income without, Kenyon says, compromising in terms of innovation and experimentalism. The staging of popular musicals including South Pacific last year and Les Mis\u00e9rables for its 25th anniversary in 2010 will continue with Opera North and Carousel in the autumn. All at the risk of the producing company, though \u2013 \"that gives us a security to be able to invest in the development and innovative work that we want to keep on doing,\" he Kenyon. The centre will also announce new programming details. It will, for example, continue its tradition of staging theatre in foreign languages \u2013 last year's German Hamlet is just one of many examples \u2013 and present Nosferatu in Polish, based on Bram Stoker's Dracula and a co-production with the company TR Warszawa. The new cinema will open in the autumn with lots of German expressionist silent horror films. One of the centre's biggest art shows will be a photography exhibition in the autumn focusing on the 1960s and 1970s, a golden age for the genre when auteurs from around the world were emerging and were documenting what was happening \u2013 not necessarily for magazines and newspapers, but with the aim of trying to make sense of what was going on. The show will feature the work of artists including David Goldblatt from South Africa, Boris Mikhailov from Ukraine and Bruce Davidson from the US. It will also announce the renewal of one of several artistic associate partnerships it has formed. The choreographer Michael Clark and his company will present a new work this year and have signed up with the Barbican for another three years. Next year the Los Angeles Philharmonic, led by Gustavo Dudamel, will play their first associate residency. That the Barbican is stepping forward so boldly is a sign that it seems to have won the many uphill battles it has faced. Just getting built was one. The idea of an arts centre was first mooted in the 1960s but construction, at the then truly enormous cost of \u00a3156m, did not begin until 1971. When the Queen opened it, in 1982, people were falling out of love with its brutalist, concrete architecture. Early visitors complained of electric shocks from the metal handrails \u2013 or they simply got lost. Much of those orientation problems were sorted out when the architects Allford Hall Monaghan Morris completed a \u00a335m \"acoustic and aesthetic\" overhaul of the centre in time for its 25th anniversary. If anyone were in any doubt that not getting lost was an issue, then just look at the vast 9-metre (30ft) high orange arrow telling people to \"go this way\" installed near the Silk Street entrance. Another crisis involved the Royal Shakespeare Company's decision in 2002 to completely give up the Barbican as its London base. The centre got over that by forging its own reputation for eclectic commissioning. Fast forward to 2012, and the idea of the Barbican riding high in ugly building polls, as it once did, seems a distant memory. Architectural tours of the Barbican centre and estate are hugely popular and many people would give their back teeth to live there, although upwards of \u00a3500,000 for a pokey one-bedroom flat might provide something of a disincentive. There is an enormous amount of affection for the Barbican, although Kenyon is not complacent: \"Sometimes I feel, do we put out enough warmth in return? We can sometimes appear quite severe.\" That's one reason the centre has scheduled a big James Bond show and that popular musicals are now an annual fixture. \"It's quality, it's popular and it welcomes in a whole new audience. \"Any arts organisation has to move with the times, it has got to move with the way the audience is changing \u2013 the question is, how flexible can the Barbican be going forward?\" \"I think you'll see the Barbican adjust, adapt and expand \u2013 it is a very exciting time and I feel incredibly lucky to be here at this moment.\"",

      "body": "<p>For an organisation that is trying to be more inclusive, more involving, the name \"Barbican\" \u2013 a defensive structure, a fortification to keep the hordes out \u2013 is possibly not ideal. \"I say 'watchtower',\" the arts centre's chief executive, Sir Nicholas Kenyon, says when asked to define it. \"It is something that looks out on the city and beyond it.\"</p> <p>Whatever the definition, most people know what the Barbican centre is, where it is \u2013 and even how not to get lost there. That has not always been the case but, after many uphill battles, an awful lot of people now even love the place.</p> <p>On Thursday the <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Barbican</a> will celebrate its 30th anniversary, entertaining guests in its enormous and unlikely tropical conservatory \u2013 with more than 2,000 species of plants and trees as well as finches, quails, terrapins and koi carp \u2013 before offering them the chance to sample a typically diverse range of artistic delights, whether a gig by country rockers <a href=\"http://www.jayhawksofficial.com/\" title=\"\">the Jayhawks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cheekbyjowl.com/\" title=\"\">Cheek by Jowl's sexy 'Tis Pity She's a Whore</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/16/cannes-2011-the-tree-of-life-review\" title=\"\">Terence Malick's film The Tree of Life</a>.</p> <p>Kenyon, who ran the Proms for 11 years before taking over at the Barbican in 2007, is only its fourth overall boss after first Henry Wrong, who got the place built; then Detta O'Cathain, whose early 1990s tenure is seldom mentioned; and 12 years of John Tusa who, with his artistic director, Graham Sheffield, established it as a powerhouse of eclectic and internationalist commissioning.</p> <p>In 2012, Kenyon's priorities include scaling the Barbican's brutalist concrete ramparts: \"We want to be porous, we want to get beyond the walls and show that the arts that animate the Barbican can really serve the city as a whole.</p> <p>\"The issue for all arts centres is can they respond to the changing desire of the audience which, in our view, is to belong more, to have a sense of ownership and to participate more.\"</p> <p>Part of that is doing more in the local area of the City of London as well as moving east, forming partnerships in boroughs including Hackney and Tower Hamlets.</p> <p>Kenyon also wants to help create a cultural quarter on the centre's doorstep and in the autumn will open a new Barbican cinema just outside its main entrance. The centre's main screen will remain but the new cinema \u2013 with two 156-seat auditoria \u2013 replaces the two smaller screens in the centre, which few people could ever find.</p> <p>\"It will be a local cinema for the City and an international cinema for an arts centre,\" he says. The centre is also collaborating with the Guildhall schools&#xa0;in a new 650-seat concert venue on Silk Street.</p> <p>\"With those two buildings, you're starting to get the beginnings of a cultural quarter round here,\" said Kenyon.</p> <p>Kenyon accepts that the Barbican was built with \"a very defined idea of what the arts was \u2013 the old model of the arts being offered to the audience, 'We know what's good for you.'\"</p> <p>It has, though, turned out to be much more flexible than its designers could ever have imagined. The foyers in particular have proved ideal for more informal work and the centre was packed last Saturday and Sunday for two days of mostly free arts events at the <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/weekender\" title=\"\">Barbican Weekender</a>.</p> <p>Like most arts organisations, the Barbican is having to operate with less money. Unlike most arts organisations, it gets little public money. The biggest chunk of its funding comes from the City: this year it amounts to \u00a317.3m \u2013 a&#xa0;7%&#xa0;decrease.</p> <p>It is trying to cope with that by increasing box office and commercial income without, Kenyon says, compromising in terms of innovation and experimentalism.</p> <p>The staging of popular musicals including South Pacific last year and Les Mis\u00e9rables for its 25th anniversary in 2010 will continue with Opera North and Carousel in the autumn. All at the risk of the producing company, though \u2013 \"that gives us a security to be able to invest in the development and innovative work that we want to keep on doing,\" he Kenyon.</p> <p>The centre will also announce new programming details. It will, for example, continue its tradition of staging theatre in foreign languages \u2013 last year's German Hamlet is just one of many examples \u2013 and present Nosferatu in Polish, based on Bram Stoker's Dracula and a co-production with the company TR Warszawa.

      "bodyText": "Humans and gorillas last shared a common ancestor 10 million years ago, according to an analysis of the first full sequence of the gorilla genome. The gorilla is the last of the living great apes \u2013 humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans \u2013 to have its complete genetic sequence catalogued. Scientists, led by researchers from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, also found that 15% of the gorilla's genome is closer between humans and gorillas than it is between humans and chimpanzees, our closest animal relative. The genomes of all three species are, in any case, highly similar: humans and chimpanzees share more than 98% of their genes, while humans and gorillas share more than 96%. The genetic sequence was taken from a female western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) named Kamilah and published in Nature. An initial analysis also showed similarities in genes involved in sensory perception and hearing, and brain development showed accelerated evolution in all three species. Genes associated with proteins that harden up skin were also particularly active in gorillas \u2013 which goes some way to explaining the large, tough knuckle pads on gorillas' hands. \"Gorillas are an interesting animal in their own right but the main reason they are of particular interest is because of their evolutionary closeness to us,\" said Aylwyn Scally, an author of the research from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. \"They're our second-closest evolutionary cousins after chimpanzees and knowing the content of the gorilla genome enables us to say quite a lot about an important period in human evolution when we were diverging from chimpanzees.\" Comparing the sequences of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas has enabled scientists to put a more accurate clock on when the three species split from their last common ancestors. It was traditionally thought that the emergence of new species (known as \"speciation\") happens at a relatively localised point in time but emerging evidence suggests that this is not necessarily the case, that species split over an extended period. Studying the gorilla genome suggests that the divergence of gorillas from the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees happened around 10 million years ago. Humans and chimpanzees last shared a common ancestor around 6 million years ago. Eastern and western gorillas split some time in the last million years. One curious find was the evolution of genes associated with hearing, which seem very similar between humans and gorillas. \"Scientists had suggested that the rapid evolution of human hearing genes was linked to the evolution of language,\" said Chris Tyler-Smith, senior author from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. \"Our results cast doubt on this, as hearing genes have evolved in gorillas at a similar rate to those in humans.\" Scally adds that it could well be that there has been a parallel acceleration in these genes for two entirely different reasons \u2013 that human hearing has developed because of speech and gorilla hearing has developed to serve an entirely different, but as-yet-unknown, purpose. The researchers said that studying the gorilla genome would shed light on a time when apes were fighting for survival across the world. \"There's an interesting background story of great ape evolution,\" says Scally. \"The common ancestor of all four great apes was sometime back in 15 to 20 million years ago. At that time, it seems to have been a nice time to have been an ape \u2013 it was a golden age \u2013 a lot of the world was just right for the kind of environment for apes to live in. Since that time, the story has been of fragmentation and extinction \u2013 most of the great ape species that have existed have gone. Today, all the non-human apes are really endangered populations, they're living in forest refuges and population numbers are quite low. Humans look like an exception to that \u2013 we're all over the world now and live in places where you could never have had a primate beforehand.\" Today, gorillas are classified as critically endangered and populations have plummeted to below 100,000 individuals in recent decades due to poaching and disease. They are restricted to equatorial forests in countries including Cameroon, Central African Republic, Gabon, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Angola. \"As well as teaching us about human evolution, the study of great apes connects us to a time when our existence was more tenuous,\" say the researchers in Nature. \"And in doing so, highlights the importance of protecting and conserving these remarkable species.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 15 March 2012. The original used the term \"genetic code\" as a synonym for \"genome\". This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "\"It would be ideal if Fukushima could steer us away from prophecies and towards a sensible assessment of market economics, climate science and nuclear risks. Then nuclear power would serve the public, not the other way around. I don't know how many reactors we would get, but we would get the number that we need.\" In the fiendishly complex debate on the merits of nuclear power, that analysis is the most clear-eyed and crisply expressed that I have seen. It comes from nuclear industry veteran and academic Peter Bradford and is published in the leading journal Nature. I'll make no apology from quoting from his article liberally. On 11 March, it will be one year since the enormous earthquake and tsunami, which killed at least 16,000 people and caused a catastrophic meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. The impact on nuclear power has been profound and the anniversary is a good time to reflect on what role the technology has to play in delivering low-carbon, secure energy at reasonable cost. The \"prophecies\" Bradford rails against are statements made with \"great certainty\" about the \"unknowable or implausible\". He gives examples from all sides of the debate: Germany has declared that existing nuclear capacity is too dangerous and can be phased out at little cost. The Middle East and the Czech Republic assert that new nuclear is a vital low-carbon energy source. Others, including the United Kingdom, have said that there will soon be new nuclear without subsidies. Let's tackle the last example first, as it's closest to home for me. Bradford again makes the point crisply. The UK government is now having to torture the language of new policies to subsidise new reactors without this being recognised as such. That contortion, the result of a coalition between two parties with opposing views on nuclear power, alongside the fallout from Fukushima appears to have heavily dented UK public confidence. A new Guardian/ICM poll shows that in February 2012, 61% of people said they would be strongly opposed to a new nuclear power station being built near their home, compared to 39% in early 2010 (though other polls should be noted). The question of subsidies is central to Bradford's analysis: The most implacable enemy of nuclear power in the past 30 years has been the risk not to public health, but to investors' wallets. No new nuclear-power project has ever bid successfully in a competitive energy market anywhere in the world. That's pretty damning and explains Bradford's next point: big nuclear programmes only happen when citizens sign blank cheques. At the time of the Fukushima disaster, only four countries (China, Russia, India and South Korea) were building more than two reactors. In these four nations, citizens pay for the new reactors the government chooses to build through direct subsidies or energy price hikes. A rare exception to this is the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction in Finland, by French-state owned company Areva, which is also hoping to build new plants in the UK. Bradford explains: Areva was gambling that the project would jump-start demand for its newest reactor design. As Olkiluoto is four years behind schedule and more than \u20ac2 billion ($2.7 billion) over budget, that gamble has fallen flat. The bind for nuclear, argues Bradford, is that gas is likely to be a lot cheaper than new nuclear unless there is a high price on carbon, which there needs to be to tackle climate change. But if the carbon price is high, \"there are many other alternatives that could be built on a large scale more quickly\", he says, such as energy efficiency, wind power and switching from coal to gas. The solution, Bradford argues, is simply to let nuclear energy earn its place: Wise economic and environmental policy will have to allow nuclear energy whatever place it can earn among other energy sources, and not burden it with unnecessary hopes and fears ... All greenhouse-gas mitigating measures and alternative-energy sources should have to compete with each other in the marketplace. Here is a rare point where I don't fully agree with Bradford. Is it really possible to have true competition when nuclear power carries the small but inherent risk of a major disaster that only a state and its taxpayers could cope with? Bradford notes the paradox in the land of the free market, the US, where: the right-wing legislators who swept into state and federal office in 2010 have conflicting tendencies towards nuclear energy: they are largely pro-nuclear, pro-market, climate-change sceptics, yet they disparage governmental backing of particular technologies with taxpayers' money. The first licence to build new reactors in the US since 1978 was granted on 9 February. These will be sited in Georgia, which Bradford notes, is \"one of the few states with a law assuring that energy customers will pay all reactor costs regardless of price.\" The US is also one of only three countries in which a majority of the public supported nuclear power in a poll across 224 countries in June 2011. Given that virtually all the thinking in this post has come from Bradford, I will give him the last word: Buffeted by economic forces, new nuclear capacity cannot be expected to contribute significantly to global energy supplies or to climate-policy solutions in the decades ahead.",

      "body": "<p>\"It would be ideal if Fukushima could steer us away from prophecies and towards a sensible assessment of market economics, climate science and nuclear risks. Then nuclear power would serve the public, not the other way around. I don't know how many reactors we would get, but we would get the number that we need.\"</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/apr/21/chernobyl-nuclear-power-fukushima\">fiendishly complex debate</a> on the merits of nuclear power, that analysis is the most clear-eyed and crisply expressed that I have seen. It comes from nuclear industry veteran and academic <a href=\"http://www.vermontlaw.edu/Academics/Environmental_Law_Center/Institutes_and_Initiatives/Institute_for_Energy_and_the_Environment/Overview/Institute_Staff.htm\">Peter Bradford</a> and is published in the leading journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7388/full/483151a.html\">Nature</a>. I'll make no apology from quoting from his article liberally.</p> <p>On 11 March, it will be one year since the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/fukushima\">enormous earthquake and tsunami</a>, which killed at least 16,000 people and caused a catastrophic meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. The impact on nuclear power has been profound and the anniversary is a good time to reflect on what role the technology has to play in delivering low-carbon, secure energy at reasonable cost.</p> <p>The \"prophecies\" Bradford rails against are statements made with \"great certainty\" about the \"unknowable or implausible\". He gives examples from all sides of the debate:</p> <blockquote> <p>Germany has declared that existing nuclear capacity is too dangerous and can be phased out at little cost. The Middle East and the Czech Republic assert that new nuclear is a vital low-carbon energy source. Others, including the United Kingdom, have said that there will soon be new nuclear without subsidies.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let's tackle the last example first, as it's closest to home for me. Bradford again makes the point crisply.</p> <blockquote> <p>The UK government is now having to torture the language of new policies to subsidise new reactors without this being recognised as such.</p> </blockquote> <p>That contortion, the result of a coalition between two parties with opposing views on nuclear power, alongside the fallout from Fukushima appears to have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/01/local-opposition-onshore-windfarms-tripled\">heavily dented UK public confidence</a>. A new Guardian/ICM poll shows that in February 2012, 61% of people said they would be strongly opposed to a new nuclear power station being built near their home, compared to 39% in early 2010 (though <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jan/18/nuclear-power-public-support-opinion-fukushima\">other polls should be noted</a>).</p> <p>The question of subsidies is central to Bradford's analysis:</p> <blockquote> <p>The most implacable enemy of nuclear power in the past 30 years has been the risk not to public health, but to investors' wallets. No new nuclear-power project has ever bid successfully in a competitive energy market anywhere in the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's pretty damning and explains Bradford's next point: big nuclear programmes only happen when citizens sign blank cheques.</p> <blockquote> <p>At the time of the Fukushima disaster, only four countries (China, Russia, India and South Korea) were building more than two reactors. In these four nations, citizens pay for the new reactors the government chooses to build through direct subsidies or energy price hikes. </p> </blockquote> <p>A rare exception to this is the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction in Finland, by French-state owned company Areva, which is also hoping to build new plants in the UK. Bradford explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>Areva was gambling that the project would jump-start demand for its newest reactor design. As Olkiluoto is four years behind schedule and more than \u20ac2&#xa0;billion ($2.7 billion) over budget, that gamble has fallen flat.</p> </blockquote> <p>The bind for nuclear, argues Bradford, is that gas is likely to be a lot cheaper than new nuclear unless there is a high price on carbon, which there needs to be to tackle climate change. But if the carbon price is high, \"there are many other alternatives that could be built on a large scale more quickly\", he says, such as energy efficiency, wind power and switching from coal to gas.</p> <p>The solution, Bradford argues, is simply to let nuclear energy earn its place: </p> <blockquote> <p>Wise economic and environmental policy will have to allow nuclear energy whatever place it can earn among other energy sources, and not burden it with unnecessary hopes and fears ... All greenhouse-gas mitigating measures and alternative-energy sources should have to compete with each other in the marketplace.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a rare point where I don't fully agree with Bradford. Is it really possible to have true competition when nuclear power carries the small but inherent risk of a major disaster that only a state and its taxpayers could cope with?</p> <p>Bradford notes the paradox in the land of the free market, the US, where:</p> <blockquote> <p>the right-wing legislators who swept into state and federal office in 2010 have conflicting tendencies towards nuclear energy: they are largely pro-nuclear, pro-market, climate-change sceptics, yet they disparage governmental backing of particular technologies with taxpayers' money.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/business/energy-environment/2-new-reactors-approved-in-georgia.html\">first licence to build new reactors in the US since 1978</a> was granted on 9 February. These will be sited in Georgia, which Bradford notes, is \"one of the few states with a law assuring that energy customers will pay all reactor costs regardless of price.\" The US is also one of only three countries in which a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jun/23/nuclearpower-nuclear-waste\">majority of the public supported nuclear power</a> in a poll across 224 countries in June 2011.</p> <p>Given that virtually all the thinking in this post has come from Bradford, I will give him the last word:</p> <blockquote> <p>Buffeted by economic forces, new nuclear capacity cannot be expected to contribute significantly to global energy supplies or to climate-policy solutions in the decades ahead.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "The Libyan leader, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, has vowed to use force to stop the country breaking up after leaders in an eastern region declared autonomy. \"We are not prepared to divide Libya,\" he said, blaming infiltrators and pro-Gaddafi elements for backing the autonomy plan. \"We are ready to deter them, even with force.\" His comments come amid mounting evidence that Libya is slowly splintering into a series of rival fiefdoms controlled by competing militias, who increasingly follow their own agendas rather than acting in the national interest. In February, the city of Misrata, which suffered a brutal siege by pro-Muammar Gaddafi forces, forged ahead with its own municipal elections, while the militia in Zintan is still holding Gaddafi's son Saif. Misrata has established a security zone that prohibits many Libyans from entering. It held the first city council elections in Libya last month, without the involvement of the ruling National Transitional Council (NTC). The sense of growing instability in Libya was compounded by a recent Amnesty International report that the hundreds of militias vying for power in the country were out of control and increasingly behaving like mafia organisations. Jalil's comments are unusually strident for the Libyan leader and came a day after 3,000 activists, politicians and tribal leaders met in the eastern city of Benghazi to inaugurate a self-declared Cyrenaica Provisional Council. As well as deep rivalries between individual cities, Libya has long been marked by a divide between east and south \u2013 Cyrenaica and Tripolitania \u2013 that has re-emerged since the fall of the old regime. This history is exacerbated by the fact that most of the country's oil reserves are in the east. The competition has led to armed clashes in the capital, Tripoli, and elsewhere and a growing distrust as the country has struggled to move forward to elections and a national government since Gaddafi's overthrow last October. Their declaration of autonomy, and the appointment of Ahmed al-Senussi, a relative of Libya's former king, Idris, as head of the Cyrenaica council, has rapidly spiralled into a crisis. Jalil warned: \"I call on my brothers the Libyan people to be aware and alert to the conspiracies that are being plotted against them and to be aware that some people are dragging the country back down into a deep pit.\" Pro-autonomy leaders say their ambition is limited to self-government in a region of Libya that had been neglected by the former regime of Gaddafi. The Cyrenaica council insisted that control of the national army, foreign policy and oil reserves would remain with the national government. But the declaration is also a reminder of the strength of regional and tribal affiliations in a country whose provinces formed the current state of Libya only in 1934, having been occupied by Italy and before that by the Ottoman empire. Critics see it as evidence that eastern leaders want to form a breakaway state. It is lost on few Libyans that Cyrenaica, which stretches from the city of Sirte to the Egyptian border, contains 80% of Libya's oil and only 20% of the population. \"It is crazy. Libya cannot divide,\" said Abdulfatah Alghannai, a student in Misrata. \"Nobody wants it. The martyrs and the wounded fought to unite Libya, not divide it.\" The call for autonomy centres on an eight-point declaration to \"administer the affairs of the province\". Protests against the move took place earlier this week in Tripoli and Benghazi itself. The call underlines the continuing fragmentation of a country where the central government has been struggling to exert control, four months after the official end of the revolution. The NTC has been the target of sporadic protests nationally over its failure to hold meetings in public or reveal the destination of the country's booming oil revenues. Libya's militias remain outside central government control, many distrusting a national army staffed by Gaddafi-era officers. Sporadic clashes between militia groups have continued in parts of the country.",

Image: courtesy of Dave Rintoul, 6 August 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. motion-sensitive camera Question: This challenging North American mystery bird was captured by a motion-sensitive camera on the Konza Prairie last summer. These cameras are part of an experiment to compare herbivory by large critters (e.g. bison) to grasshoppers. The cameras detect motion in an area that is not enclosed, where bison or deer might be grazing. These cameras have captured pictures of coyotes, other birds like great horned owls, etc., but the identity of this particular bird seemed ambiguous on later analysis. What taxonomic family and species of bird do you think this is? Response: This is a juvenile eastern bluebird, Sialia sialis. Juveniles can be identified by their grey plumage with white spots on their upper and underparts, and by their white eye ring, which is bolder at the back of the dark eyes. Juvenile eastern bluebirds can be sexed by their plumage colour, which is fairly rare for birds: juvenile males have slightly more blue in the wings and tail than do young females. Where their ranges overlap, they can be confused with western bluebirds, but eastern bluebirds are a bit smaller and have a slightly thicker bill. Eastern bluebirds can be found in a variety of open areas with scattered trees and short ground cover, such as orchards, woodlands, suburban parks and yards, and pastures. They are voracious insectivores, although they also consume invertebrates and wild fruits. They are especially fond of grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, and beetles, which is the reason that many people work hard to attract them to their gardens. Bluebirds are cavity-nesting passerines that will use old woodpecker holes when they can find them, although these days, many bluebirds rely on nest boxes provided by bird-friendly humans. Eastern bluebirds breed on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains from southern Canada all the way to the Gulf of Mexico and into Central America. [map]. The eastern bluebird's range has a tiny area of overlap, in southern Texas, with the ranges of mountain and western bluebirds. Here's a short informational video about eastern bluebirds: Visit MObirds's YouTube channel [video link]. There are three bluebird species in North America, and all are placed into the same genus, Sialia, in the taxonomic family, Turdidae, or thrushes.

      "bodyText": "Trade unions and Labour MPs reacted with anger on Wednesday after the government announced the closure of two in three of the remaining Remploy factories for disabled workers with the loss of more than 1,700 jobs. The other factories face a highly uncertain future under plans to wind up the state agency and float off its profitable parts or sell them to commercial operators. The announcement by Maria Miller, minister for disabled people, brought to a head a bitter and long-running battle over the Remploy factories, which were set up after the second world war to provide sheltered employment for disabled people. Most disability charities back the move on grounds that the sheltered factory model is long outdated. But unions expressed outrage, pointing out that the decision came just days after the passage of the government's welfare reforms and represented a second crushing blow to disabled people. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said: \"This is a barbaric decision. The government has sunk to a new low by sacking over 1,000 disabled workers.\" Phil Davies, national secretary of the GMB union, said: \"It is a disgrace that a number of large charities, set up to help disabled people and run by very well-paid, able-bodied people, have misled the British public and provided the government with the cover to undertake this act of sacking disabled workers. Shame on them.\" Many Remploy factories have already closed, but only a handful of the remaining 54 break even on their operations, which range from making toiletries to the supply of components to the motor industry. The average subsidy for each job in the factories is \u00a325,000 a year. With a five-year government funding package of \u00a3555m for Remploy running out at the end of this month, ministers commissioned a review of the whole issue of employment support for disabled people, led by Liz Sayce, chief executive of charity Disability Rights UK and an open critic of sheltered employment. Miller said a public consultation on its recommendations had found an \"overwhelming consensus\" behind its central theme that the \u00a3320m spent annually by government on disability employment \u2013 which would be protected \u2013 should be concentrated on disabled people themselves. \"That is why we have accepted the recommendation from the Sayce review to refocus support on individuals through services like Access to Work, rather than institutions like Remploy, so more disabled people can work in mainstream employment rather than government-funded segregated factories,\" Miller said. Of the 54 factories, 36 described as \"not viable\" will lose their subsidy from 31 March. They employ a total of 1,752 people including 1,518 people with disabilities. The other 18 factories, described as \"potentially viable\" and employing 910 people, including 706 with disabilities, will continue to share a reduced subsidy while they are being assessed for a future \"outside government control\". A spokesman said this would mean \"employee-led or open-market exit\". The same assessment will be made of Remploy Employment Services, the separate operation which helps people into mainstream jobs. Last year, it assisted 20,000 people to find or keep jobs. All disabled Remploy employees affected by the changes will be guaranteed a share of an \u00a38m package of support over 18 months. \"Around half\" of this fund will be provided to them in the form of personal budgets averaging \u00a32,500 each. To sugar the pill further, Miller announced an extra \u00a315m over three years for the Access to Work programme, which provides support such as interpreters, special technology and office adaptations for disabled people taking mainstream jobs. The programme has a current annual budget of \u00a3100m. The minister said the \u00a315m, combined with \"other efficiencies\", would help a further 8,000 people into work or to retain an existing job. Phil Friend, vice-chair of Disability Rights UK, said: \"Organisations led by disabled people have campaigned long and hard for employment support on our own terms, so we can work in every type of job and every part of the economy. That is the right model for the future.\" While the Remploy factory model was right for the 1940s, it was unsustainable today, Friend said. In the Commons, however, the Labour shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, branded the announcement a \"callous decision\". He said it was \"disappointing\" that it had been made in a written statement just after prime minister's questions. Ann Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley, attacked the \"extreme discourtesy\" of the means of the announcement and declared: \"It is an utter disgrace to do this to disabled people.\" With seven Remploy factories in Wales among those earmarked for closure, affecting 272 workers, the Welsh government expressed profound disappointment and predicted the effects would be \"devastating for those workers, their families and the local communities\". Union leaders warned the closure plans would \"not go unanswered\". Shop stewards from all the Remploy factories will meet later this month.",

      "bodyText": "Prime minister's questions began with a sombre tribute to the six British soldiers killed in Afghanistan. In some way, their deaths are \"keeping us safe\", though no one explained exactly how. Cameron and Miliband were in close agreement. Miliband then paused to leave a cordon sanitaire between his earnest encomia and the political rough-housing he was saving for later. At the end we had tributes to the Queen on the occasion of her diamond jubilee. At times like this, politicians don't so much deliver a speech as unfurl it. The prime minister was so full of praise for Her Majesty I thought he might pop with the sheer pressure of his adoration. He listed almost all the things she had done in the course of over 60 years. She had been introduced to as many folk as the population of New Zealand. (How alarming! All those people saying \"fush\" instead of \"fish\".) She had had 2 million people to tea! You would think from his tone that she had baked the scones and fairy cakes herself. \"In all her realms she is loved, because she is the Queen of everyone! 'Diamond' is the appropriate epithet for this jubilee. For all her life, she has been a point of light in our national life.\" Then, with the air of a Turkish carpet salesman who has just rolled back his most beautiful hand-stitched, gold-threaded carpet, woven from the pubic hairs of a thousand angora goats, he sat down. Thank goodness for Sir Peter Tapsell, the father of the house, who is so grand that the Queen probably celebrated his diamond jubilee, in 1990. He praised her \"stunning beauty\". He told us that one of his predecessors had sent Queen Victoria a parasol on the occasion of her diamond jubilee, trimmed with Chantilly lace. With his terrific bulk, Sir Peter would have made a superb British Big Bopper \u2013 \"Chantilly lace, and a purty face \u2026\" \u2013 though to my knowledge the Queen has never had a pony tail hangin' down, and most certainly not a wiggle when she walked. Sir Peter had sent her another parasol, also trimmed with lace. How perfect! It is well known that Sir Peter is just what you need for blotting out the sun. Earlier, Mr Cameron had a stroke of luck, if you can call it that. Dame Joan Ruddock described a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy, unable to walk or even go to the toilet, who faced the prospect of losing her benefits because of rule changes. \"Can he look me in the eye and tell me he is proud of this decision?\" It would have been an almost impossible situation for any politician to escape. Except that Cameron had a child with cerebral palsy himself and had been there and gone through the bureaucratic mill. Did it change the basic case? No, of course not. But it got him out of that particular hole. A Tory MP who shouted \"Shame!\" at Dame Joan was reproved by the Speaker. Ed Miliband made some good points about welfare changes. The PM did what he always does when Miliband shows signs of besting him: he deploys personal abuse. \"When people dial up a radio phone-in, and they eventually work out who he is, they always say he is not remotely up to the job!\" And the bald patch has shifted slightly towards the top right.",

      "bodyText": "At any one time there will always be a TV drama that everyone is talking about, and just at the moment it's the American show Homeland, a paranoid soap opera about a US Marine Corps sergeant who is sensationally discovered by American forces walled up in a dungeon in Baghdad having heroically defied his captors for eight years. He is brought home to the United States, an instant hero. But a psychologically troubled and overworked CIA agent has a hunch that this man has in fact been \"turned\" by al-Qaida, and that this all-American wonderboy is now a sleeper agent biding his time, using his celebrity to insinuate himself back into the military machine at a higher level, before perpetrating a new Islamist outrage on US soil. The sergeant is played by Britain's Damian Lewis, the agent by Claire Danes and the ambitious CIA deputy director is David Harewood. Homeland-upmanship is now growing among the media classes, some of whom are not shy of letting the rest of us know they have seen the entire first season in the US. I myself am just up to episode three, in line with the UK terrestrial broadcast, but was nonetheless hoping to score a few Homeland-upmanship points by virtue of having talked about the programme with David Harewood himself in the BBC Breakfast green room \u2013 he was going on to talk about getting an MBE. However, this paltry effort has been aced by my colleague Jonathan Freedland, who has written a brilliant article about the Israeli TV show on which Homeland is based. Well, I still think there's something that hasn't been discussed enough. And that is the fact that Homeland is not solely based on an Israeli television drama \u2014 it's also inspired by the 1962 John Frankenheimer movie The Manchurian Candidate, about a decorated Korean war veteran who comes home having been brainwashed by the communists and primed to assassinate the president. Homeland actually woke me up to an important buried meaning in that movie, which I didn't realise until watching this show. Jonathan Freedland rightly points out that the most sensational moment in Homeland (at least so far) is when we see Sgt Brody secretly begin the Muslim's traditional morning prayers in his garage. It is a moment which provokes and yet challenges our instinctive shock \u2014 isn't this proof of his perfidy? No. There are millions of patriotic American Muslims. Might he not, during his eight-year ordeal, have chanced upon the beauty and contemplative calm of Islam, and found some spiritual comfort in it, while remaining an impeccably patriotic American? Homeland very much resembles dramas such as The Wire and The Sopranos in that it is about a group of people who are under surveillance, giving an extra frisson to our own viewing experience and intensifying the drama of these eavesdropped-upon lives. In The Manchurian Candidate, the experience of being televised is deeply important: appearing on a television screen one is intensely scrutinised and exposed, and yet the spectacle is also an imposture. The Manchurian Candidate, I always thought, is very similar to the cult 1960s TV show The Prisoner (which of course came later) \u2014 just as the weird opening titles to Homeland, with the strange maze images, are also somewhat Prisonerish. To continue the Sopranos analogy for a moment, Sgt Brody begins a touchingly and unexpectedly gentle friendship with his eldest daughter, very like Tony and Meadow Soprano, and the spectacle of the scantily clad women employed by the mysterious Saudi potentate cunningly suffuses the drama with a kind of porno-sexiness, like the dancers at Tony Soprano's Bada Bing club. The most pointed line comes from Harewood, the CIA chief. He is insistent that the US must keep its guard up (though without suspecting Brody) and most agitated by the thought that everyone in the country, both civilians and in uniform, is somehow under the impression that the war on terror is over and everyone can relax. It is a fascinating idea: that America is coming to terms with the waning of a great \u2013 or at any rate greatly dramatic \u2013 era: the 9/11 era. Of course, anti-US hatred and anti-US terrorism is a continuing issue, especially considering the new tension with Iran. Guant\u00e1namo Bay detection camp is still open for business and the tragically misconceived military adventure in Iraq continues. But it could be that we are all daring ourselves to believe the main event is at an end. Well, in horror movie terms, the lull at the finish is precisely when the monster makes its final attack \u2013 when the hand shoots up out of the grave. And that is where Sgt Brody comes in, with his much-feared final plan to destroy America. This could be the meaning of Homeland, a mischievous satire on Obama-era complacency. But I think it is something else, and this applies to The Manchurian Candidate too. It is rather that Sgt Brody symbolises the spores of scepticism and discontent, the mixed and complicated freight of doubt and disillusion, being carried back to the US en masse by the returning troops. They are a body of people who have accumulated unique, eyewitness connection with a foreign land, a more potent connection than that of any diplomat, think-tank adviser, journalist or intellectual. They may well have been \"turned\" in some indistinct way. And it is only in the drawdown period, the late phase of homecoming \u2013 so dangerous in the CIA chief's view \u2013 that their opinions and feelings will be introduced into the American bloodstream. In 2004, a remake of The Manchurian Candidate was released, directed by Jonathan Demme. It was pretty disappointing, perhaps at least partly because the time wasn't right. It's only now, in 2012, that this story could be effectively retold, and not by a film but a TV drama.",

Might he not, during his eight-year ordeal, have chanced upon the beauty and contemplative calm of Islam, and found some spiritual comfort in it, while remaining an impeccably patriotic American?</p> <p>Homeland very much resembles dramas such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/wire\" title=\"\">The Wire</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/the-sopranos\" title=\"\">The Sopranos</a> in that it is about a group of people who are under surveillance, giving an extra frisson to our own viewing experience and intensifying the drama of these eavesdropped-upon lives. In The Manchurian Candidate, the experience of being televised is deeply important: appearing on a television screen one is intensely scrutinised and exposed, and yet the spectacle is also an imposture. The Manchurian Candidate, I always thought, is very similar to the cult 1960s TV show The Prisoner (which of course came later) \u2014 just as the weird opening titles to Homeland, with the strange maze images, are also somewhat Prisonerish.</p> <p>To continue the Sopranos analogy for a moment, Sgt Brody begins a touchingly and unexpectedly gentle friendship with his eldest daughter, very like Tony and Meadow Soprano, and the spectacle of the scantily clad women employed by the mysterious Saudi potentate cunningly suffuses the drama with a kind of porno-sexiness, like the dancers at Tony Soprano's Bada Bing club.</p> <p>The most pointed line comes from Harewood, the CIA chief. He is insistent that the US must keep its guard up (though without suspecting Brody) and most agitated by the thought that everyone in the country, both civilians and in uniform, is somehow under the impression that the war on terror is over and everyone can relax. It is a fascinating idea: that America is coming to terms with the waning of a great \u2013 or at any rate greatly dramatic \u2013 era: the 9/11 era. Of course, anti-US hatred and anti-US terrorism is a continuing issue, especially considering the new tension with Iran. Guant\u00e1namo Bay detection camp is still open for business and the tragically misconceived military adventure in Iraq continues. But it could be that we are all daring ourselves to believe the main event is at an end.</p> <p>Well, in horror movie terms, the lull at the finish is precisely when the monster makes its final attack \u2013 when the hand shoots up out of the grave. And that is where Sgt Brody comes in, with his much-feared final plan to destroy America.</p> <p>This could be the meaning of Homeland, a mischievous satire on Obama-era complacency. But I think it is something else, and this applies to The Manchurian Candidate too. It is rather that Sgt Brody symbolises the spores of scepticism and discontent, the mixed and complicated freight of doubt and disillusion, being carried back to the US en masse by the returning troops. They are a body of people who have accumulated unique, eyewitness connection with a foreign land, a more potent connection than that of any diplomat, think-tank adviser, journalist or intellectual. They may well have been \"turned\" in some indistinct way. And it is only in the drawdown period, the late phase of homecoming \u2013 so dangerous in the CIA chief's view \u2013 that their opinions and feelings will be introduced into the American bloodstream.</p> <p>In 2004, a remake of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/102424/manchurian.candidate\" title=\"\">The Manchurian Candidate</a> was released, directed by Jonathan Demme. It was pretty disappointing, perhaps at least partly because the time wasn't right. It's only now, in 2012, that this story could be effectively retold, and not by a film but a TV drama.</p>",

Also to Bild,\" the tabloid said. \"But we say 'NO'.\" Bild argues that the proposed deal \"on its own will not help Greece back on its feet\". \"A debt writedown without Greece's exit from the eurozone does not address the question how the Greek economy can ever pick up again and create new jobs,\" it said. The newspaper, which has 12 million readers in Germany, bought \u20ac10,000 of Greek debt at a heavily discounted price of \u20ac4,815 in the secondary bond market in December. The bonds mature on 20 March, and Bild was expecting to pocket the full nominal value of \u20ac10,000. But under an agreement between Athens and its main creditors, bondholders are being asked to take a writedown, or \"haircut,\" of at least 70%. The restructuring is set to reduce Greece's debt burden by more than \u20ac100bn and is crucial to prevent a messy default, which would send shockwaves through financial markets. The value of Bild's bonds will be slashed to just \u20ac3,000 under the deal. Even with the huge discount it got when it paid for the bonds, the newspaper will still suffer a 38% loss on its holdings. The bond swap has been accepted by a long list of European banks, including Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Athens has passed legislation to force reluctant bondholders to participate if two thirds agree to the deal. Banks, insurers and investment funds holding debt issued under Greek law must decide by 8pm GMT on Thursday, while those who hold Greek bonds issued under foreign law have until 11 April to make up their minds. Bild dismissed the debt swap as a \"sham\", arguing that many of the economic scenarios on which the deal was based were \"unrealistic\". It also noted that after the snap Greek election in April, the country's new government may not stick to the drastic reforms required under the terms of the new bailout package. Last week Bild urged the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, to reject the second bailout for Greece that is tied to the debt restructuring. The paper did add a PS: \"If Bild should after all make a profit with the bonds it will be donated to a good cause.\"",

The background: Electric Guest specialise in soulful, funked-up pop so insidiously catchy you suspect it was designed as a homage to \u2013 even a pastiche of \u2013 the originators of the form. In fact, it turns out frontman Asa Taccone's brother Jorma is a founder member of American comedy troupe the Lonely Island and helped come up with Saturday Night Live song-skit Dick in a Box, suggesting parody is in his DNA and adding weight to the theory that Electric Guest's intent is satirical, although who or what they're taking potshots at remains unclear: their lyrics are less soul-baring than a sequence of pop tropes, and the way they're framed suggests autobiography is not a concern. They've also got that man Danger Mouse in the producer's chair for their debut album, Mondo, which enhances our impression of this music as ironically detached, a see-what-we-can-do exercise rather than an emotional exorcism, as original R&amp;B was intended to be. We don't know why \u2013 and it's definitely meant as a compliment rather than a criticism \u2013 but whenever we see DM's imprimatur and hear his glossily tight, precise productions we think: cool, clever, calculating. Final proof that EG come wrapped in quote marks came last month when they began their month-long residency at the Echo in LA's none-more-hip Echo Park. Here is a band destined to get great reviews but shift few units: the great British public don't buy (into) ironic detachment. Then again, we thought the same thing about Scissor Sisters when we heard their debut LP, and that went on to become the UK's biggest-selling album of the year. There's a similar sense with Mondo of a hipster's take on cheese, of Guilty Pleasures \u2013 Motown and MOR, smooth-fi and 70s/80s daytime radio funk-lite \u2013 given a cred makeover. \"I have a sweet tooth for terrible music, so I won't even say what I'm influenced by,\" says Taccone, while his other half, Matthew Compton, admits to a love of \"indie rock and 60s-era French pop, so there's a little bit of everything on the album\". Like we say, it could sell: EG's management company Monotone Inc's clients include Jack White and Vampire Weekend (and, incongruously, QPR skipper Joey Barton), so it's not out of the question. And they've got their own pint-sized Jake Shears-alike in Taccone, a strutting junior Jagger with an androgynous falsetto prepared to front EG's tunes with as much gall as it takes. And those tunes are pretty decent, particularly This Head I Hold, which is Gnarls Barkley revisited or Maroon 5 with a cool producer (Danger Mouse, say). It's groovy in the 60s sense, the sort of thing that could soundtrack the next Austin Powers movie. Under the Gun is 80s-slick and Awake has a hip-hop inflection. Waves moves at a frantic You Can't Hurry Love pace while Troubleman is the eight-minute baroque centrepiece and American Dream sounds like something that would have been played to death on American radio circa 1975. It's all very Danger Mouse, though. It could almost be a solo album. To what extent were Electric Guest involved? Does it really matter? Not to us. The buzz: \"Electronic-tinged soul grooves\" \u2013 Stereogum. The truth: They will be loved. Most likely to: Swagger like Jagger. Least likely to: Smoke reefer like Keef.

      "bodyText": "In direct terms, apparel production does not only heavily depend on water availability. However, the industry's usage patterns directly impact the global water profile through the use of pesticides for growing fibre crops, the discharge of waste water from dyeing and \u2013 importantly \u2013 laundry habits at home. A mere 2.5% of Earth's water is freshwater and only 0.3% of it is readily accessible to humans. This is equivalent to 0.01% of all water on Earth. Of this fraction, 8% goes towards domestic use, 22% is used by industry, and 70% for irrigation. If the research is correct, humanity's water footprint will reach a level 40% above reliable, accessible water supplies by 2030. Cotton accounts for 90% of all natural fibres used in the textile industry. It is used in 40% of all apparel produced globally, with synthetics accounting for 55%. Cotton farming is also the single largest water consumption factor in the apparel supply chain. For a simple reason: the regions where most cotton is grown are dry \u2013 the southern US, India, Mali and the Aral Lake area. The fashion industry's relationship with water goes beyond cotton. Some 14.4% of an apparel retailer's total water footprint relates to manufacturing. An estimated 17 to 20% of industrial water pollution comes from textile dyeing and treatment and an estimated 8,000 synthetic chemicals are used throughout the world to turn raw materials into textiles, many of which will be released into freshwater sources. Worse: the industry is rampant with players that don't respect the citizen's right to safe water. This all said, the fashion industry's upstream supply chain is not solely responsible for its problematic relationship with water. The impact of people washing clothes at home is equally important: 40% of domestic water footprints stem from laundry, a significant proportion of which comes from washing clothes by hand in the developing world. Laundry detergents, generally ignored in the water pollution discussion, add yet another dimension: 16% of the Danube's phosphate loads stem from detergents, causing the EU to take first legislative steps for a total ban on phosphates in detergents. Water resources will be under progressive pressure as the world population increases and more extreme climatic conditions will impact our ease of access. As access to water becomes increasingly complicated, the textile and apparel industry's heavy reliance on thirsty cotton crop will shift. The quest for alternative fibre sources \u2013 raw, natural, synthetic, renewable or recycled \u2013 is accelerating. The variety of available natural fibre species is vast, however, the proliferation of cotton has caused a lag in technological investments and industrial developments needed to improve their suitability for the apparel industry. Recent industrial research results are promising, and are bound to introduce new options. Improvements in dye and laundry technologies, in industry as well as at home, are showing results; clothes (eg Levi's Water",

This is equivalent to 0.01% of all water on Earth. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/25/us-population-water-idUSTRE79O3WO20111025\" title=\"\">Of this fraction</a>, 8% goes towards domestic use, 22% is used by industry, and 70% for irrigation. If the research is correct, humanity's water footprint will reach a level 40% above reliable, accessible water supplies by 2030.</p> <p>Cotton <a href=\"http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/Cotton\" title=\"\">accounts for 90%</a> of all natural fibres used in the textile industry. It is used in 40% of all apparel produced globally, with synthetics accounting for 55%. Cotton farming is also the single largest water consumption factor in the apparel supply chain. For a simple reason: the regions where most cotton is grown are dry \u2013 the southern US, India, Mali and <a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/worlds-4th-largest-lake-is-now-90-dried-up-pics-video.html\" title=\"\">the Aral Lake area</a>.</p> <p>The fashion industry's relationship with water goes beyond cotton. Some 14.4% of an apparel retailer's total water footprint <a href=\"http://www.trucost.com/blog/71/global-water-resources-pushed-to-the-brink\" title=\"\">relates to manufacturing</a>. An estimated 17 to 20% of industrial water pollution <a href=\"http://blog.airdye.com/goodforbusiness/2009/09/30/water-pollution-and-the-textile-industry/\" title=\"\">comes from textile dyeing and treatment</a> and an estimated <a href=\"http://earthpledge.org/ff\" title=\"\">8,000 synthetic chemicals</a> are used throughout the world to turn raw materials into textiles, many of which will be released into freshwater sources. Worse: the industry is rampant with players that don't <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118580938555882301.html\" title=\"\">respect the citizen's right to safe water</a>.</p> <p>This all said, the fashion industry's upstream supply chain is not solely responsible for its problematic relationship with water. The impact of people washing clothes at home is equally important: 40% of domestic water footprints stem from laundry, a significant proportion of which comes from washing clothes by hand in the developing world.</p> <p>Laundry detergents, generally ignored in the water pollution discussion, add yet another dimension: 16% of the Danube's phosphate loads <a href=\"http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-pages/dw1101_p_06.htm\" title=\"\">stem from detergents</a>, causing the EU to take <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/chemicals/documents/specific-chemicals/detergents/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">first legislative steps</a> for a total ban on phosphates in detergents.</p> <p>Water resources will be under progressive pressure as the world population increases and more extreme climatic conditions will impact our ease of access. As access to water becomes increasingly complicated, the textile and apparel industry's heavy reliance on thirsty cotton crop will shift.</p> <p>The quest for alternative fibre sources \u2013 raw, natural, synthetic, renewable or recycled \u2013 is accelerating. The variety of available natural fibre species is vast, however, the proliferation of cotton has caused a lag in technological investments and industrial developments needed to improve their suitability for the apparel industry. Recent <a href=\"http://www.jute.org/research_dvlp.htm\" title=\"\">industrial research results</a> are promising, and are bound to introduce new options.</p> <p>Improvements in dye and laundry technologies, in industry as well as at home, are showing results; clothes (eg <a href=\"http://store.levi.com/waterless/\" title=\"\">Levi's Water&lt;Less</a>) as well as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/mar/09/xeros-washing-machine-bills\" title=\"\">washing machines</a> with a low water and/or detergent footprint have already entered the market. With rising water and electricity bills, the rhythm of development and innovation for industry equipment and home appliances will no doubt increase further.</p> <p>We also can expect a re-evaluation of what is produced and when. Some suppliers and retailers could find it difficult to operate their current business models under the shifted conditions. Products with higher margins \u2013 the mid to top segment in the apparel sector \u2013 will be able to meet new financial and production constraints more easily and take up a priority position in the eyes of supplying manufacturers.</p> <p>Low-margin, high-volume contracting retailers, on the other hand, could be challenged to find suppliers in possession of both the necessary manufacturing technology and reliable access to the amount of water resources required.</p> <p><em>Dr Pamela Ravasio is an independent researcher, journalist and consultant specialising in sustainable fashion businesses processes.

      "bodyText": "With a mayoral election just weeks away, a mansion tax is not the housing issue Londoners should be talking about. Speculation is rife about whether some form of mansion tax will make it into the budget on 21 March, with some Londoners already up in arms about the impact this could have on the capital, where many of the country's most expensive homes are located. But is this really the big housing issue Londoners should be talking about? Since 2000, the average house price in the capital has risen from \u00a3192,000 to \u00a3415,000, with the average deposit now more than three times the median London wage \u2013 just \u00a325,400 after tax. Millions of priced-out Londoners are being forced into the capital's swollen rental market, vulnerable to eviction at short notice and facing rents that take up as much as half of their pay cheque. Figures released yesterday by Shelter show that 1.8 million people are planning to leave the capital because of the high cost of housing. While a mansion tax could play a part in solving these problems, it isn't enough. As the mayoral election approaches, the real question on Londoners' lips should be: what will the next London mayor do to tackle London's housing crisis? Londoners consistently rate the cost of housing as one of the most pressing issues facing the capital, even more than transport or crime. Yet although the mayoral candidates are talking about housing, none have put it centre stage, and it has consistently had a low profile at City Hall. By contrast, transport has always been a key battleground \u2013 no doubt partly due to the photo opportunities and iconic policies, be it Ken's bendy buses or Boris's bikes, which it so readily provides. Yet from May, the next mayor will have significant new powers over housing in the capital, handing the winning candidate a golden opportunity to fix London's housing and make a real difference to Londoners' lives. This includes, for the first time, control over the budget for building new housing, which means the buck will stop with the mayor when it comes to delivering more affordable homes. So far, no mayor has managed to build anything close to the 33,400 homes the capital needs each year to meet demand. The next mayor will not only control the money, but will also take ownership of a large chunk of the capital's public land on which many of these homes could be built. The next mayor should also start getting a grip on London's rental market, which now houses one in four Londoners. A quality lettings service backed by the mayor could reduce the misery and uncertainty of setting up a new tenancy \u2013 including hefty deposits that can mean upfront costs of up to \u00a32,000 per move. A dedicated team to tackle rogue landlords in the capital would also help to give tenants the protection they need. Once they're in a home, London's 200,000 private renting families \u2013 a quarter of all families in the capital \u2013 would also welcome a deal that enabled them to stay in that home for the long term, to put down roots and see their kids through school. That means having a degree of certainty in their tenancy, and predictability about future rent rises. London is one of the few capitals in Europe without this. An ambitious mayor should not stop there. If some form of mansion tax does go ahead, it's vital that the next mayor demands that some of the proceeds from the new tax are ring-fenced for new housing in the capital. They should also look for ways to leverage the power of London's financial sector to find new sources of private investment for the homes that London needs. The government has already launched its own review on the barriers to greater institutional investment in the private rental market. The mayor could play a much greater role in encouraging the investment industry, including pension funds, to invest more in residential development in the capital. Come 4 May, the next London mayor will have a historic opportunity to fix London's housing crisis. Londoners should be asking the candidates whether or not they will take it. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

Just Drive by Alistair Griffin will provide the soundtrack to the satellite broadcaster's wall-to-wall coverage of the sport, which will begin with the Australian Grand Prix later this month. Griffin appeared on the second series of BBC1's Fame Academy in 2003. The original version of Just Drive, which was inspired by F1, was used by BBC Sport in a montage of images to mark the end of the 2010 season. It has been re-recorded with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and singers from the Berkshire-based Rodolfus Choir. Sky's 43-second opening credits will feature archive footage of former world champions and memorable F1 moments from 32 grand prix between 1950 and 2011. Sky Sports F1 HD producer, Martin Turner, said: \"The first time I heard Just Drive, I loved it and every time you hear it you love it more and more. \"It fits for both the modern and historic context of Formula 1 and I'm sure our viewers will like it.\" The BBC has remained loyal to Fleetwood Mac's The Chain for its F1 coverage but ITV had a variety of them tunes provided by Jamiroquai, Apollo 440, a Bachman-Turner Overdrive remix and Moby. Griffin said: \"F1 was the inspiration behind Just Drive and I always hoped it would strike a chord with fans of motorsport. \"To have Sky Sports F1 HD take Just Drive as its theme tune is absolutely amazing. There is a history of anthemic songs associated with F1 and I would love for Just Drive to become one of those songs.\" The BBC and Sky joined forces to secure live rights to F1 motor racing in a seven-year deal until 2018 \u2013 but only half of the races will be broadcast on the BBC. Sky will broadcast the sport on a dedicated F1 channel available to Sky Sports subscribers and HD customers. It is the first time F1 races have not been available live on free-to-air television. The BBC was the traditional home of F1 motor racing for many years until the rights were bought by ITV in 1997.

The move, which does not apply to Post Office branded mortgages sold by the bank, will add \u00a381 a month to the cost of a \u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage. The bank said it was responding to significant increases in the cost of funding mortgages, and that its SVR remained competitive \"compared to its UK lending peers\". It pointed out that this was the first time it had increased the SVR since August 2007. The move follows SVR increases by Halifax and RBS, and means that around 1.15 million borrowers face increased mortgage costs, unless they are able to move to a new deal. Before the Bank of England base rate fell to its record low in 2009, borrowers tended to remortgage away from their lenders' SVR and on to cheaper fixed-rate and discount deals, but in recent years SVRs have often been lower than the other rates on offer and remortgage rates have slumped. Brokers said customers were likely to reconsider their options in the light of the announcement. David Hollingworth of London &amp; Country said the fact that the first rise didn't come in until June \"means there is time to avoid any of the high rate if people start the remortgaging process now. Some will have more options that others, and the amount of equity people have in the property will be key.\" Andrew Montlake, director of mortgage brokers Coreco, said the rate rise \"will hurt \u2013 there are a lot of people who are going to be very worried about the sheer scale of that rise\". He added: \"There will be some that are able to remortgage and there are some good deals out there, with free legals and free valuations from the lender. But there will be a swathe of people who will struggle to remortgage given changes to their situations and lending criteria, and it is those people who will be really hit by the change.\" Hollingworth said the fact the rise followed so hot on the heels of Halifax's announcement could be a coincidence, as Bank of Ireland had a cap on its SVR for some of its customers which recently expired. Both Nationwide building society and Lloyds TSB retain SVRs at 2.5% for some of their customers, but these are tied to the Bank of England base rate so they are unable to raise them.",

      "bodyText": "Military spending by Asian countries, led by China, is rising fast and for the first time is likely this year to outstrip Europe, where governments are cutting their defence budgets, according to a leading London-based thinktank. \"While the west reduces its spending on defence, Asia is becoming increasingly militarised as a result of rapid economic growth and strategic uncertainty,\" John Chipman, director general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said at the launch of its latest annual Military Balance survey. Asian countries increased their defence budget by more than 3% in real terms last year, the IISS said. China increased its share of total military expenditure on weapons in the region to more than 30%. Official Chinese military spending totalled nearly $90bn last year, more than two-and-a-half times the 2001 level. Western analysts point to China's plans for naval \"force projection\" to defend its growing economic interests in Africa and elsewhere, and secure maritime lanes of communication. Most attention has focused on China's first aircraft carrier, the former Soviet ship the Varyag, and its new J-20 combat aircraft. \"But China's technological advances are more modest than some alarmist hypotheses of its military development have suggested\", Chipman said. \"They represent nascent rather than actual capability. China, for example, does not yet have the capability to operate fixed-wing aircraft from a carrier.\" More immediately significant is China's development of anti-satellite capacities, anti-ship ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and cyber-warfare capabilities. \"Managing tensions in the South China Sea will be an increasing challenge,\" said the IISS report. Defence analysts also pointed to potential tensions between the US and China being aggravated by Beijing refusing to agree to confidence-building measures along the lines of those between the US and the Soviet Union during the cold war. \"China does not want to give a seatbelt to the US,\" one defence analyst said. Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are all investing in improving air and naval capacities, as are India, Japan and South Korea. India, for instance, plans to boost maritime capacities with submarines and aircraft carriers, said the IISS. In Europe, defence budgets remain under pressure and cuts to equipment programmes continue. Between 2008 and 2010 there were reductions in defence spending in at least 16 European Nato member states. In a significant proportion of these, cuts in real terms exceeded 10%.",

      "bodyText": "5.13pm: We are now winding up the live blog for today, but we will be back on Monday at 10am. In the meantime, you can read the latest developments on the MediaGuardian homepage and our Leveson inquiry page. 4.16pm: Here's Vikram Dodd's article on Bob Quick's evidence this morning: Former Metropolitan police assistant commissioner John Yates resisted an attempt to examine his phone records over allegations he was leaking information from the cash for honours investigation, saying he was \"very well connected\", the Leveson inquiry has heard. Bob Quick, then chief constable of Surrey, said he was called in to review the cash for honours criminal investigation led by Yates. He gave it a clean bill of health but in January 2007 Quick was called in again after Britain's top civil servant, Gus O'Donnell, complained that the police were leaking details to the media. O'Donnell specifically named Yates as the source of the leaks from the investigation, which menaced the then Labour government. Quick alleges that the then Met deputy commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, did not implement his recommendation that the phone records of Yates, who was leading the inquiry, should be examined for evidence that he was leaking against the Labour government or evidence ruling him out. Quick alleges he clashed with Yates over his suggestion. As he resisted the suggestion, Yates told him: \"No Bob, I am very well connected.\" Quick told Leveson his review found no evidence implicating Yates as the leaker. You can read the full article here. 4.15pm: Godwin has now finished his evidence. 4.12pm: Jay asks if he recalls that Stephenson would \"go ballistic\" if the inquiry into Damian Green was reopened. He says he can't recall that, but can recall there were concerns over the time it was taking. 4.05pm: In June/July 2011, Godwin made two misconduct referral reports to the professional standards body. One of these related to Neil Wallis's Chamy Media and the other to Amy Wallis, the former NoW deputy editor's daughter. Chamy Media won a contract for PR consultancy worth \u00a324,000 a year with Scotland Yard following Wallis's resignation from the paper, while his daughter got a civilian role with the Met. Yates was accused of \"inappropriately securing\" the job for Wallis's daughter and resigned shortly after these allegations became public last summer. 4.03pm: Godwin is asked about the Mail on Sunday article about Quick's wife's business. He says he can't recall exactly what was said but Quick was \"extremely upset\", he was getting a lot of attention and his family were getting a lot of attention, that was \"having a big impact on his life\". Godwin says he can't recall being asked to do anything other than get the press office involved. 4.01pm: Godwin is asked if Quick challenged Johnston's view that the arrest of Green was disproportionate. He says Quick did, but both sides had arguments and there were still lines of inquiry to be investigated. Godwin says he was more supportive of Johnston's view. 4.00pm: Godwin confirms he was at the meeting Bob Quick referred to earlier at which he said Sir Paul Stephenson said he was going to resign over the Damian Green affair. Godwin recalls that he was going to retire at the end of this tenure. 3.55pm: Jay asks Godwin how journalists got his number when he didn't fraternise with them. Godwin says he wouldn't like to speculate when asked if the press office might have leaked it to friendly journalists. 3.54pm: Godwin says leak inquiries are very difficult to pursue and prosecute. 3.53pm: Godwin says it is \"open to debate\" that a \"police source\" is a police source at all. \"We shouldn't be hiding away from being held to account,\" he adds. He says if the police are in a position to answer a question that doesn't interfere with operational matters they should. 3.52pm: Tim Godwin's evidence has now been published on the Leveson inquiry website. 3.48pm: Lord Justice Leveson's earlier use of the F-word (he quoted from the Guardian, he didn't actually swear) is buzzing on Twitter. Blogger Jack of Kent is one of those amused: The #Leveson Inquiry at Court 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice: a magical place where Lord Justice Leveson swears, and Paul Dacre does not. \u2014 David Allen Green (@JackofKent) March 7, 2012 3.46pm: Jay says there is \"nothing of interest\" to discuss in Godwin's register of interests and wants to move on. But Leveson intervenes: \"The fact that there is nothing of interest, means it is of interest. What do you think that you might have one set of values and your colleagues \u2026 might have quite different values. How does that come about and should it?\" Godwin says they had common values regarding conduct, but there was \"one style\" favoured by the management board and there was \"my style\" where he didn't feel comfortable socialising with the press. 3.42pm: Godwin concedes he did \"have words\" with Yates about the frequency and the manner of his meetings with the press. He did \"disapprove\" at that point. He says he didn't have the detail the inquiry has about Yates' meetings with the press, but thinks they have the potential to be \"embarrassing and unfortunate\". 3.41pm: Godwin says as deputy commissioner he had limited contact with the media but he would have meetings in his office; he would also attend the CRA's Christmas party and the Evening Standard's 1,000 most influential people awards. But he was concerned that socialising with journalists would create a \"perception\" issue. He says his view is not necessarily the right one. \"There are two schools of thought,\" he says about relations with the media. 3.37pm: Godwin's opening remarks note that following the Macpherson inquiry into the investigation into the death of Stephen Lawrence, the Met was perceived as a \"closed and secretive organisation\". 3.33pm: The inquiry has resumed and Tim Godwin has taken the stand. 3.24pm: Quick has now finished his evidence and the inquiry is taking a short break. 3.23pm: So, did Sir Paul Stephenson offer to resign over the Damian Green affair or not? Neil Garnham, QC for the Met, asks about the meeting on 1 December 2008 with Sir Paul Stephenson. Garnham asks if it was correct that Stephenson had told Quick he was not going to renew his contract the following April, not that he was going to resign. Quick stands his ground. \"He told me he had written his resignation out,\" he says. 3.19pm: Jay asks Quick what he hypothetically would have done had he been in charge following the Guardian's phone-hacking relevations on 9 July 2009. \"The Guardian were challenging very strongly the first investigation, I would like to think I would have concerned myself with what the first investigation had or hadn't revealed and whether there was any substance to these allegations.\" He adds he \"certainly had concerns at the time that an inquiry was ruled out at an early stage.\" 3.19pm: Quick says he knew from his experience in the Met of that \"risky interface between the police and journalists who are in a fiercely commercial environment seeking scoops, exclusives and stories\". 3.13pm: Quick says on at least two occasions when he was invited to drinks at a wine bar near Scotland Yard, he saw Yates, Fedorcio and Stephenson having drinks with Lucy Panton of the News of the World and Mike Sullivan of the Sun. He said he also recalled Yates in social situations with the Daily Mail's Stephen Wright. He adds he was surprised as Wright had written a number of articles critical of Blair and the Met. Quick is asked if he believes Yates briefed Wright, but says he doesn't know. He says such socialising had perception of looking inappropriate. 3.12pm: Quick is asked about his contact with journalists, and says he didn't socialise with them. He adds that his approach was to keep relationships formal, transparent and diaried. When he returned to the Met as assistant commissioner, he was briefed that there was an established relationship between ACSO (special operations) and the Crime Reporters' Association. 3.08pm: Quick said he considered resigning and decided to do so, but before he had actually done so the mayor announced the acceptance of his resignation on TV. 3.06pm: Quick is now being asked about a notorious photograph of him entering Downing Street with a briefing note on counter-terrorism on display on 8 April 2009. He explains that he was handed a sheath of papers by his staff that morning and he noticed as his car made its way down Downing Street that the notes were marked \"secret\". It was unusual for any secret documents to be handed to him in loose form. He was reading the notes in his car when the door of No 10 was opened and his natural reaction was to jump out of the car and go inside. Inadvertently, he left one of the \"secret\" papers on display. 3.00pm: Leveson says an article appeared in the Guardian on 22 December 2008 that quoted a well-placed Conservative as saying \"Bob Quick is behind this. I'm going to fucking get him this time.\" It reads: Bob Quick moved quickly this morning to declare a truce with the Conservative party after it became clear that David Cameron had him in his sights. An early morning appearance by the Tory leader on LBC Radio, in which he demanded an apology from the Met's counter-terrorism chief, prompted Quick to issue an an unreserved apology. This was immediately accepted by Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, who said the Tories were keen to move on. But the matter will not end there; it has provided conclusive proof that the Conservatives are at war with senior figures in the Met. Many Tories are saying that it will take the appointment of an outsider, possibly Sir Hugh Orde from Northern Ireland, who started his career at the Met, to repair the damage. The Tories have long had Quick in their sights because he was one of the main officers who explained \u2013 some would say attempted to sell \u2013 the government's controversial plan to detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days. David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, took particular offence at one briefing with Quick when he appeared to be unfamiliar with one of the main arguments against the 42 day plan. Civil rights campaigners said there was no need for a change in the law because of the so called \"threshold test\", which exists already. This allows the authorities to charge a terror suspect on weaker evidence than would be needed in normal criminal cases. The Tories emphatically deny having briefed the Mail on Sunday that Quick's wife ran a wedding chauffeur car business which sparked his outburst. But one well placed Tory said after Damian Green's arrest: \"Bob Quick is behind this. I'm going to fucking get him this time.\" 2.58pm: Quick says his wife \"had no altermative but to wind down the business\". 2.54pm: The Mail on Sunday ran a follow-up story the following week titled \"Top terror chief's car hire firm is operating without a licence\". Britain's top anti-terror police chief faces more embarrassing questions over a luxury car hire business run from his home which appears to be operating illegally and is being investigated by the local council. The business, run by the wife of Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick, the officer who sanctioned the highly controversial raid on the House of Commons office of Tory MP Damian Green, could face prosecution and a fine of up to \u00a33,000. Inquiries by this newspaper have established that the business, which hires out vintage Rolls-Royces and Mr Quick's 130mph Jensen Interceptor for about \u00a3500 a day, does not have an operator's licence. This could have a bearing on the validity of its passenger insurance policies. The business, Aphrodite Wedding Services, also appears to have broken the law on two more counts \u2013 failing to obtain a private-hire licence for its vehicles and to register its drivers. Quick points out that no licence was necessary. 2.53pm: Sean O'Neill of the Times has just tweeted: @Mad_as_Hell_UK backdrop to all this is who was pro or anti Ian Blair ... Quick was a Blair supporter \u2014 Sean O'Neill (@TimesCrime) March 7, 2012 2.50pm: Quick says the article had \"an impact on my family's safety\" but that neither Fedorcio nor Stephenson intervened on his behalf. He told Fedorcio that the Mail had made the connection between him and his wife's business for potential extremists. He moved his children out of their home and implemented a number of security precautions. 2.49pm: Quick felt the story was a reaction to the Green affair and went to Stephenson arguing that someone should talk to the MoS editor. \"If I am honest, I didn't feel I had huge support from my colleagues,\" he adds. 2.45pm: Both the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday had been critical of the Green affair. Quick got a call on 20 December 2008 from the Yard's press office that the Mail on Sunday wanted to know if serving officers were used as drivers. The MoS conceded, eventually, there was no truth in this. However, it ran a story written from a \"security\" angle titled \"Security scare over wedding car hire firm run from top terror police chief's home\": Questions have been raised over the judgment of Britain's top anti-terror police chief after it emerged that a wedding car hire business - including one of his own cars - is being run from his home. Promotional photographs show classic cars parked on the front driveway of the home of Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick. The business uses former police officers as chauffeurs for the stable of vintage Rolls-Royces. Mr Quick, who sanctioned the highly controversial arrest of Tory MP Damian Green and the raid on his House of Commons office, has been told to carry out checks on publicity material and internet advertising for the business. 2.42pm: His wife used a photo of a vintage Jensen Interceptor car that belonged to Quick on the car service's website. However, the Jensen was not offered for hire. She became suspicious about calls, which she believed to have come from the Daily Mail, asking to hire the Jensen. 2.41pm: Quick is asked about attacks by the media on the wedding chauffeur service his wife had been running. A client had got a call from the Mail on Sunday and they wanted to know about Quick, whether he drove the cars, and whether they used police officers in uniform as drivers. He says the business was not of interest, but it was his connection to the business. 2.40pm: The Cabinet Office has subsequently got some of Johnston's report redacted. When support from the Cabinet Office for Quick's claim that it was that body that thought it was a criminal matter was sought, \"it was not forthcoming\". 2.38pm: Stephenson then asked him to \"stop the investigation\" which Quick believed was not appropriate. 2.37pm: Quick says Paul Stephenson and Godwin seemed \"very preoccupied during the meeting about the negative media attention\". \"I sensed it was having an enormous impact about how people were thinking about this case,\" says Quick. 2.36pm: Ian Johnston launched a review in December and he was given just two weeks to report. Godwin asked Quick to attend a meeting to discuss the findings. The report found that the decision to arrest Green was \"disproportionate\". Quick says he was surprised at this. the Cabinet Office at the time believed it was a \"criminal matter\"; they had been investigating the leaks for sometime without success and the person leaking had access to very sensitive information. \"I found it strange that there was this emphasis constantly that it was not a criminal matter,\" says Quick. 2.33pm: Index on Censorship has just tweeted: Quick says he knew of D Mail journo who had \"done a pretty good job\" of trying to \"demolish\" Met over a few years #leveson \u2014 IndexLeveson (@IndexLeveson) March 7, 2012 and Quick says he had \"concerns\" over relationships between Met and certain journos #leveson \u2014 IndexLeveson (@IndexLeveson) March 7, 2012 and When asked by Jay, Quick names Mail journo as Stephen Wright #leveson \u2014 IndexLeveson (@IndexLeveson) March 7, 2012 and Quick adds that Yates was close to Wright #leveson \u2014 IndexLeveson (@IndexLeveson) March 7, 2012 2.31pm: Jay suggests that there was a job open at the top and senior staff knifing each other was one way of getting ahead. 2.30pm: Quick says he believes the review of his investigation was convened \"in haste and air of semi-panic\" and was a result of pressure being applied to the Met. There were reports attributed to someone close to the acting commissioner saying he didn't support the arrests, claims that \"really troubled me\". He says the report in the Daily Telegraph that he had a row with Stephenson was \"false\". 2.25pm: Quick had concerns with some of the media reports. Yates asked to see him in the office and told him that his inquiry was \"doomed\" because the CPS would withdraw its support for the investigation as it did in the cash for honours inquiry. Quick says he couldn't stop unless there wasn't a legitimate reason for dropping the investigation. \"We had just seized a load of evidence that we hadn't the opportunity to examine yet \u2026 it didn't seem a tenable argument.\" 2.24pm: There was a meeting the following day with Sir Paul Stephenson and the acting deputy commissioner Tim Godwin. Quick says he could see why Stephenson would have to resign. He couldn't see the police were doing anything other than their duty to investigate wrongdoing at the Home Office. 2.22pm: When Quick briefed Sir Paul Stephenson prior to the arrest, they discussed that the arrest would be \"controversial\". However, Quick says he was not prepared for the heavy criticism and \"some of the reporting was a surprise\". 2.16pm: Green was arrested at his Kent constituency and was brought to London but after initially saying he was \"too tired\" to be interviewed, he agreed to be questioned, but gave a \"no comment\" interview. 2.16pm: Quick is asked about the circumstances leading to the arrest of Green. Former DAC John McDowall was involved. The advice was that a search of a parliamentary office would be lawful. There was then a discussion as to whether it was appropriate to arrest an MP or whether to invite him to attend a police station voluntarily. However, a number of pieces of information came to light via Galley and therefore the \"gold group\" within Scotland Yard was unanimous the only way forward was to arrest. (The \"gold group\" is a senior strategic decision making body of senior staff. Quick was chairman of the group.) 2.11pm: Jay asks Quick about the Damian Green leaks case. Quick says he asked Cressida Dick to conduct a scoping exercise after claims junior Home Office civil servant Christopher Galley was allegedly passing information to Tory MP Green. Galley admitted that four of the six leaks were linked to him. He claimed that David Davis introducted him to Green and that the MP said he was seeking \"dirt on the Labour government\". Galley's claim was he wanted a job in the Tory parliamentary party and Green had given him \"positive signals\" about helping him. 2.06pm: The inquiry has resumed and Bob Quick is continuing his evidence. 1.03pm: The inquiry has now broken for lunch and will resume at 2pm. 1.01pm: Quick discusses an article in the Mail on Sunday by then shadow home secretary David Davis that he says misrepresented the Met's position on detention without charge. 12.50pm: Quick says he asked Yates for access to his phone records, but the assistant commissioner refused, saying \"I am too well connected\". When pressed on this Yates said, \"No \u2026 I am very well connected.\" Quick says he thought this was \"a bit of theatre\". The matter was raised with commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, who made it clear he would not be taking it further. 12.49pm: One of the recommendations in Quick's report was \"a retrospective analysis\" of Yates's telephone records to corroborate his view that the assistant commissioner was not leaking. Jay says that this was a rather \"tepid\" recommendation. Quick protests that whether it was \"tepid or not it was clear\". And this was standard practice when the Met suspected someone was leaking. 12.48pm: The former chief secretary to the cabinet, Sir Gus O'Donnell, raised concerns regarding unauthorised disclosures and he was specifically concerned about assistant commissioner John Yates's relationship with the media. Quick agreed to investigate over the weekend and submitted a report to the deputy commissioner on the Monday to ensure the inquiry was sound and \"there were no leaks or malpractice\". 12.46pm: Quick is asked about a review of unauthorised disclosures of information. He said he saw no evidence in his review of deliberate leaking of information. 12.39pm: Quick says he recommended an investigation into police corruption, in a report that was submitted to Andy Hayman. However, Hayman had reservations based on potential evidential difficulties and decided that this was too \"risky\". 12.36pm: Intelligence revealed payments of between \u00a3500 and \u00a32,000 were being made to officers and the journalists were claiming those back from their employers. The police unit formed the view that journalists would either be falsely be claiming this money back or the newspapers were \"somehow complicit\" in the pauyments. 12.36pm: Quick became concerned about the relationship between journalists and officers suspected of corruption. \"It became apparent that some officers were being bribed for stories,\" he says. He decided to investigate the payments to officers. 12.35pm: Quick's written statement refers to a listening device used for \"covert investigation\" against those connected to Southern. The investigation ended with the arrest of individuals. 12.34pm: The anti-corruption probe was called Operation Nigeria. It identified a number of journalists from papers including the Sun and the News of the World as having a direct relationship with Southern Investigations. 12.33pm: Jay asks about an allegations regarding Southern Investigations, the firm set up by murdered private eye Daniel Morgan. In 1999 Quick was head of the anti-corruption command. 12.31pm: The BBC's Ross HAwkins has just tweeted: Further Bob Quick basic reading t.co/lybmePHP and t.co/gFhdbLdT #leveson \u2014 Ross Hawkins (@rosschawkins) March 7, 2012 12.31pm: The inquiry has now resumed. The next witness is Bob Quick. Quick was chief constable of Surrey police in 2004, and returned to the Met in March 2008 where he was assistant commissioner specialist operations. He followed Andy Hayman in that post. He resigned from the Met in May 2009. 12.26pm: The inquiry has resumed and Bob Quick takes the stand. 12.15pm: Blair has now finished giving evidence and the inquiry is taking a short break. 12.09pm: Blair quotes the legal word \"recuse\". He says he recused himself from the \"cash for honours\" investigation because he had a high level of contact with politicians, all of which was professional. He suggests that Yates, who openly declared himself a friend of the former deputy editor of the News of the World, could have recused himself from decisions on phone hacking for the same reason. 12.07pm: Blair is asked if he has any comment on Hayman and Yates and their level of contact with News International management. \"Large number of dinners and large amounts of alcohol, that would worry me,\" says Blair. He says there are two problems: first, junior officers must look at this and ask if it is proper use of public money; secondly, there is the \"perception\" that the high level of contact and the decision not to investigate would be connected in the public's mind. 12.06pm: Blair says of the Filkin report: Elizabeth Filkin's comment that contact is permissible but not unconditional should be nailed to the front door of the police station. However, Blair says he disagrees with a whole series of injunctions and subclauses about how you should deal with the press rather than anybody else. 12.04pm: Blair say he believes Yates was not acting to protect News International, but his frequent contact with journalists and executives there was an issue. Do I believe that John Yates took that decision [not to reopen hacking inquiry] in order to placate that organisation? No I don't, but his difficulty is the number of contacts and I think that is a problem. 12.03pm: Blair says that Peter Clarke was extremely well respected and perhaps Yates's decision was an extreme example of \"group think\". 11.58am: Leveson says he realises that is is invidious to criticise but he has to consider the issue and wants to do it with the benefit of Blair's experience. Blair says he doesn't know why John Yates dismissed the Guardian report within six hours and decided there was no reason to reopen the investigation. In John Yates's expression, it was a poor decision \u2026 from what I can see, that decision was just too quick. Why could you not have gone back with all those allegations and looked further at what the material did actually say? I don't quite understand why John took that decision with the speed which he did. That decision appears to be too hasty. 11.56am: By the time the Guardian reported that phone hacking was extensive in July 2009, Blair was no longer the commissioner. Blair says it is \"invidious to criticised from the outside\". When he read the New York Times revelations in September 2010, he says he thought \"Whoa, this has got to be investigated, it is so wide.\" 11.51am: Blair is asked about a call he made to home secretary David Blunkett to let him know about phone hacking. Jay asks if this shows that he was cognisant of the extent of hacking. Blair says Blunkett was \"wildly concerned about his personal privacy\" and so he asked in advance whether the home secretary's name was on the list of potential victims. He adds he was unaware that other names linked to Blunkett were on the list. 11.49am: Blair says he was told about Goodman and Mulcaire pleading guilty to phone hacking offences in November 2006. However he says at the time terrorism was such a threat, the force was not considering much else in the way of serious crime. We had closed Heathrow airport in the middle of the holiday season, there was enormous pressure. It really was the only show in town. Any conversation about this would have been way back on the agenda and relatively short. 11.45am: Blair was told in late 2006 his number was in Glenn Mulcaire's file. Blair says he didn't take the hacking very seriously and it isn't even mentioned in his autobiography. I had no evidence that I had ever been hacked \u2026 I suppose I just put it down to experience. I can't fathom, other than to say, 'here is a memoir about years in office and phone hacking isn't mentioned once'. Blair says he didn't raise the question of whether there were more victims, as he only believed his name was in the file, not that he had necessarily been hacked: I had no evidence that I had you're been hacked, I have no evidence that anything that I had said on a telephone or been said to me or whatever had appeared in some different source, so I suppose I just put it down to experience\u2026 11.39am: Jay asks Blair whether, had he been briefed as to the probable extent of phone hacking, whether his reaction have been any different. Blair answers: Yes I think it would \u2026 in evidence to you and in conversations at different stages I am clear that Peter Clarke took a perfectly reasonable decision \u2026 he did not have the resources in light of everything else the specialist forces were dealing with \u2026 in terms of a criminal conviction. 11.38am: Lord Blair's witness statement has now been published on the Leveson inquiry website. 11.36am: The inquiry has resumed and is Blair is asked about the original phone-hacking investigation in 2006 when the former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were under suspicion. Blair believes he was told there was an investigation under way into phone hacking. The only reason he was told was because the investigation concerned the royal princes. He says listening to voicemail messages wasn't something that people had heard of before. \"I don't think people were clear about how it was done and there was a discussions of whether it was an offence at all,\" he adds. 11.26am: The inquiry is now taking a short break. 11.25am: Jay asks Blair if he ever suspected that Fedorcio was the source of the leaks. Blair says he doesn't want to say, but adds: I am concerned by the evidence that Mr Paddick gave about his conversations with [journalist] Mr Hyder to you earlier on about Dick briefing against me, so I obviously have to reflect on that. I mean, I am somebody who pretty much wishes to trust the people around me, because otherwise you just cannot operate. I think those are questions you'll have to put to Mr Fedorcio. 11.22am: The Met's director of public affairs, Dick Fedorcio, was the gatekeeper for media access to Blair. Not even the journalist from the Guardian who was shadowing Blair had his mobile number. Fedorcio had access to all the workings of the management board as he became a member of the board. Jay asks why. \"This is a very interesting question,\" says Blair, but that had been the convention for a long time. Fedorcio was not only in charge of press but also of internal communications. 11.21am: Blair says when he did an analysis on the nature of corruption faced by the Met, it discovered it had broken networks of officers and one of the \"trades was information\". Quite often the person involved was not an officer, but a civilian employed by the police. 11.20am: Blair adds on Hayman: I'm not suggesting in that answer that Mr Hayman was found to have done anything improper about that inquiry, but his telephone records were examined and gave me the cause for concern that I report in my book. \u2026. I gather he did explain that he still retained a post in relation to ACPO's media advisory chair. I'm not sure I find that sufficient in this case. 11.16am: Blair says anti-terrorism chief Andy Hayman was investigated in 2007 over alleged leaks arising from a case in Birmingham into the conspiracy to kidnap a Muslim soldier and behead him and put it on the internet. The story broke in the media so early, there was an inquiry into how it got there; telephone records were examined. Blair refers to this in his book and notes that the records showed a \"high volume of traffic on [Hayman's] telephone of telephone numbers belonging to journalists\". 11.12am: Blair believes some police officers gossiped too much with journalists \u2013 Leveson says this constitutes an \"accidental leak\". \"I think there were too many meetings with journalists which were unrecorded and unnecessary,\" says Blair. 11.11am: Blair says he has made inquiries about Operation Elveden, the the Met's investigation into inappropriate payments to police and other public servants, ahead of his inquiry appearance and says the officers who may be arrested were more likely to be junior. He adds that he has been given an assurance, \"as of a few weeks ago\", that it is was not likely there would be the arrest of senior colleagues as part of Elveden. Blair says he finds it \"inconceivable\" that senior officers would take money from the press. 11.09am: Blair says there were increasing leaks to the media during his time as commissioner, from within management and the level below. He adds that he did not suspect they were passing on information to journalists for money. 11.05am: Under Blair's proposed policy, someone in the police force who may have worked in the media before would be free to return to the media. He says, for example, if the police recruited someone from the Daily Mirror to work in the press office, it couldn't bar them from returning to work at the paper. 11.03am: Blair says he has never written for a News International paper, \"certainly not for payment\". His book was serialised by the Mail on Sunday. Blair believes a \"restriction period of two years\" should apply for all staff preventing retired officers from working in other businesses. Leveson says this issue is particularly relevant to the police because they can retire so young. Blair says the pension regime makes it more or less compulsory to leave when officers are younger than normal retirement age because they could get less money the longer they leave retirement. 11.01am: Blair discusses the arrests policy in relation to terrorist threats including the airline bomb plot in 2006. We were facing a level of terrorist threat that we had never seen before and we believed we were trying to deal with this with some relatively outdated legislation because the level of threat and atrocity was so appalling that we had to move faster than we would like, for example the airliners plot. Had seven or eight airlines blown up over the Atlantic this would have been Britain's 9/11 for the very least. That left us having to separate the wheat from the chaff. 11.00am: Blair says the force used to have a rulebook on behaviour called \"General orders\". It was, he says, an \"enormous book \u2013 a description of all the things you shouldn't do\". But he adds: \"I don't think anyone took any notice because it was too complex.\" 10.56am: Blair is talking about how his 15-year-old son got work experience at the Sun. \"The current debate over internshnips was not playing at the time,\" he says. \"I had a whole series of people interning around my office \u2026 it was a perfectly normal process.\" 10.53am: Blair continues: The Met has about 100 horses, of which I assume a regular proportion are released, and this is a regular event, because the horse is still well, but it is not strong enough to do the work that it's required to do, and the Met, I presume, quite understandably, doesn't want to put them down. So I think this is quite regular. Asked by Leveson if it was a big deal, Blair says \"No\". 10.52am: Jay asks Blair about the \"Horsegate\" affair. Blair says he has heard Fedorcio will give an acocunt of how he came to know about the loan of the horse. He reveals that he had lunch with Rebekah Brooks the day she arranged the loan from the Met. What I understand Mr Fedorcio will say is that he was telephoned by Rebekah Brooks asking about this arrangement \u2026 and that then he arranged for her to go down and see the inspector in charge of horses and then have a discussion about it and this actually seems to have happened on the day that I had lunch with her, and what I understand Mr Fedorcio is going to say is that this was discussed at the lunch. I have absolutely no recollection of that. 10.49am: Blair says he became acquainted with quite a few print journalists including Will Lewis, who was the son in law of someone he knew; Brooks; and Veronica Wadley, the former editor of the Evening Standard. He knew broadcast journalists less well, with the exception of BBC director general Mark Thompson, who was a close neighbour. 10.46am: Blair records four meetings or exchanges with Rebekah Brooks: a phone call in 2005, a meeting in 2006, a lunch in 2007 and a further exchange after she ran the headline \"Blair is doomed\" in the Sun. His wife met Brooks twice: the first time at John Stevens's leaving do; the second time was following the \"Blair is doomed\" headline when she told Brooks \"Nice headline, Rebekah.\" He says this left Brooks speechless. 10.46am: Blair says he didn't give similar briefings to any other paper. \"I don't really know why Dick thought this was such a good idea with this particular group,\" he adds. He says he didn't think a meeting with the Daily Mail would have been \"terribly successful\" because it was hostile to him. 10.41am: Jay asks about the gifts and hospitality register. Blair had a lunch with Les Hinton, the former boss of News International, on 18 September 2006. On 6 June 2007, he had lunch at Cicconi's with News of the World editor Colin Myler, deputy editor and Met PR chief Dick Fedorcio. They says he wanted to get across his frustration that the IPCC's \"Stockwell 2\" report had taken two years to produce. 10.40am: Blair says journalists are always looking for a scoop, which is why he woud not have a meeting with a reporter without a press officer present. 10.38am: Blair says he has an understanding of off-the-record briefings. HJe says \"the more industrious journalist\" cannot get the complete picture without background briefings which he thought were a \"perfectly proper thing to do\". 10.37am: Blair says the record of meetings shows he did not favour any newspaper group. \"I think the spread of the meetings that are recorded indicate that it was pretty much across the board,\" he adds. 10.33am: In 2005 there were 12 meetings with the CRA but also meetings with newspaper groups including: Times and Sunday Times: 7 Independent: 2 News of the World: 3 The Sun: 7 Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph: 5 Daily Mail: 4 Observer and Guardian: 9 Evening Standard: 3 Daily Mirror: no note of any meetings Daily Express: no note of any meetings There were none with the Daily Express or Daily Star, but Blair points out that he would have been in touch with reporters from those papers at the CRA meetings. 10.30am: Blair would meet the Crime Reporters Association once a month and have one-to-one interviews with a journalist once every couple of months. He would also meet editors occasionally over lunch at New Scotland Yard. 10.29am: Blair says that while commissioner he agreed to be shadowed by a Guardian journalist, but didn't think it was a terribly successful exercise. He says he thinks the journalist was more interested in dramatic events rather than the day-to-day workings of his office. 10.27am: Blair, unlike other former commissioners the Leveson inquiry has questioned, says he didn't generally socialise with journalists. \"I didn't have any dinners at all with editors or journalists with an exception with one friend who was a friend before I became commissioner, which was entirely social,\" he adds. 10.27am: Blair says he tried very hard to get the \"heroics and the dedication of some of the staff\" across in a way that interested the press but the media generally were not interested in this type of story. 10.26am: Blair says some of the police contact with journalists involved \"pretty heavy drinking\" but he is referring to a culture from a long time ago. 10.23am: Blair says when he became commissioner he felt the staff spent too much time worrying about what the press was going to say next. He felt the Met management board should spend less time with the media. 10.19am: Robert Jay QC, counsel for the inquiry, reads from the Daily Mail, which branded Blair \"Labour's favourite cop\" and a \"politically correct\" commissioner. In June 2005, he says, the Mail misquoted his evidence to an employment tribunal. \"This is the norm for public life, but it is dispiriting,\" Blair says. He says media coverage is \"cumulatively depressing\" as the worst possible angle is sought to be put on stories. It is \"exhausting\" at times, Blair says in a statement being read to the inquiry. Jay says Blair's comments are arguably resonant of the evidence given by Alastair Campbell to the inquiry. 10.18am: Blair says the UK has borrowed from the US where policing has become politicised. I don't know how the political genie can be put back in the bottle \u2026 My sense is about the way in which crime became a dominant issue in US politics and they have much less distinction between the operational independence of police and the way police chiefs are appointed and dismissed \u2026 We have some difficulty. If one looks at the coverage of crime in newspapers, it is enormous and politiucians are going to take note of that. 10.16am: Blair says in his written statement that the police are \"not part of the Whitehall machine\". However, he thinks the police have become \"part of the nexus of political debate\" with home affairs correspondents rather than crime correspondents reporting his and Sir Paul Stephenson's resignations. He says some journalists treat New Scotland Yard as part of the Whitehall machine, which it is not. 10.10am: Blair says the Metropolitan police is a fundamentally different environment to work compared with Surrey, and Thames Valley police had just two or three staff in the press office compared with 70 staff in the Met. 10.06am: the inquiry has begun and Lord Blair takes the stand. 10.02am: Lisa O'Carroll has just tweeted: #Leveson Up first we believe, Lord Blair. In meantime colleague Sandra Laville broke this about Sue Akers gu.com/p/36xqd/tw \u2014 lisa o'carroll (@lisaocarroll) March 7, 2012 9.50am: While we're waiting for the inquiry to begin, it's worth reading our colleague Sandra Laville's story on concerns over Sue Akers's evidence to the inquiry last month: The attorney general is examining whether the head of Scotland Yard's investigation into illegal news gathering has prejudiced fair trials for any journalists involved through her evidence to the Leveson inquiry. Dominic Grieve's office is scrutinising the testimony made by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers 10 days ago amid concerns that her comments were potentially in contempt of court. Akers is the head of three linked inquiries into phone hacking, alleged bribes and computer hacking. She said that the Sun newspaper was responsible for creating a \"network of corrupted officials\" and creating a \"culture of illegal payments\" to officials from the police, Ministry of Defence and other public bodies. In a statement about her investigation she included details of \"multiple payments\" by the Sun journalists to public officials, with one individual receiving \u00a380,000, while one journalist, she said, drew more than \u00a3150,000 over the years to pay sources, including public officials. The stories that resulted from these disclosures were \"salacious gossip\", she said, and not in the public interest. She also gave details of how the relative of one arrested public official acted as a conduit to hide the cheque payment to that individual. The Guardian understands the attorney general has received at least one complaint raising concerns that Akers's evidence \u2013 given in the midst of a criminal inquiry \u2013 could be in breach of the Contempt of Court Act and could prejudice further legal action against any of the individuals arrested. Lawyers for the attorney are investigating. A spokeswoman for the attorney general told the Guardian: \"Evidence given during the Leveson inquiry has been drawn to the attention of the attorney general's office. The attorney general will consider the concerns raised.\" You can read the full story here. 9.50am: Welcome to the Leveson inquiry live blog. Today's witnesses are the former Met commissioner Lord Blair, former deputy commissioner Tim Godwin and former assistant commissioner Bob Quick. Quick was once Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer but was forced to resign over a security leak that resulted in an anti-terror operation being brought forward. Blair was Met commissioner between 2005 and 2008 while Godwin retired late last year \u2013 he was acting commissioner after the resignation of Sir Paul Stephenson, who resigned last July after becoming embroiled in the phone-hacking scandal.

He gave it a clean bill of health but in January 2007 Quick was called in again after Britain's top civil servant, Gus O'Donnell, complained that the police were leaking details to the media.</p> <p>O'Donnell specifically named Yates as the source of the leaks from the investigation, which menaced the then Labour government.</p> <p>Quick alleges that the then Met deputy commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, did not implement his recommendation that the phone records of Yates, who was leading the inquiry, should be examined for evidence that he was leaking against the Labour government or evidence ruling him out.</p> <p>Quick alleges he clashed with Yates over his suggestion. As he resisted the suggestion, Yates told him: \"No Bob, I am very well connected.\" Quick told Leveson his review found no evidence implicating Yates as the leaker.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/07/john-yates-phone-records-leveson\">read the full article here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p>4.15pm: Godwin has now finished his evidence.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p>4.12pm: Jay asks if he recalls that Stephenson would \"go ballistic\" if the inquiry into Damian Green was reopened. He says he can't recall that, but can recall there were concerns over the time it was taking.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p>4.05pm: In June/July 2011, Godwin made two misconduct referral reports to the professional standards body.</p> <p>One of these related to Neil Wallis's Chamy Media and the other to Amy Wallis, the former NoW deputy editor's daughter. </p> <p>Chamy Media won a contract for PR consultancy worth \u00a324,000 a year with Scotland Yard following Wallis's resignation from the paper, while his daughter got a civilian role with the Met.</p> <p>Yates was accused of \"inappropriately securing\" the job for Wallis's daughter and resigned shortly after these allegations became public last summer.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p>4.03pm: Godwin is asked about the Mail on Sunday article about Quick's wife's business.</p> <p>He says he can't recall exactly what was said but Quick was \"extremely upset\", he was getting a lot of attention and his family were getting a lot of attention, that was \"having a big impact on his life\".</p> <p>Godwin says he can't recall being asked to do anything other than get the press office involved.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p>4.01pm: Godwin is asked if Quick challenged Johnston's view that the arrest of Green was disproportionate.</p> <p>He says Quick did, but both sides had arguments and there were still lines of inquiry to be investigated. </p> <p>Godwin says he was more supportive of Johnston's view.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p>4.00pm: Godwin confirms he was at the meeting Bob Quick referred to earlier at which he said Sir Paul Stephenson said he was going to resign over the Damian Green affair.</p> <p>Godwin recalls that he was going to retire at the end of this tenure.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p>3.55pm: Jay asks Godwin how journalists got his number when he didn't fraternise with them. </p> <p>Godwin says he wouldn't like to speculate when asked if the press office might have leaked it to friendly journalists.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p>3.54pm: Godwin says leak inquiries are very difficult to pursue and prosecute.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p>3.53pm: Godwin says it is \"open to debate\" that a \"police source\" is a police source at all.</p> <p>\"We shouldn't be hiding away from being held to account,\" he adds. </p> <p>He says if the police are in a position to answer a question that doesn't interfere with operational matters they should.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p>3.52pm: Tim Godwin's evidence <a href=\"http://t.co/HNmpE7Fr\">has now been published</a> on the Leveson inquiry website.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p>3.48pm: Lord Justice Leveson's earlier use of the F-word (he quoted from the Guardian, he didn't actually swear) is buzzing on Twitter.</p> <p>Blogger Jack of Kent is one of those amused:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%2523Leveson\">#Leveson</a> Inquiry at Court 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice: a magical place where Lord Justice Leveson swears, and Paul Dacre does not.</p> <p>\u2014 David Allen Green (@JackofKent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackofKent/status/177409888874541057\" data-datetime=\"2012-03-07T15:06:28+00:00\">March 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 103 --> <p>3.46pm: Jay says there is \"nothing of interest\" to discuss in Godwin's register of interests and wants to move on.</p> <p>But Leveson intervenes: \"The fact that there is nothing of interest, means it is of interest. What do you think that you might have one set of values and your colleagues \u2026 might have quite different values. How does that come about and should it?\"</p> <p>Godwin says they had common values regarding conduct, but there was \"one style\" favoured by the management board and there was \"my style\" where he didn't feel comfortable socialising with the press.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p>3.42pm: Godwin concedes he did \"have words\" with Yates about the frequency and the manner of his meetings with the press. He did \"disapprove\" at that point.</p> <p>He says he didn't have the detail the inquiry has about Yates' meetings with the press, but thinks they have the potential to be \"embarrassing and unfortunate\".</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p>3.41pm: Godwin says as deputy commissioner he had limited contact with the media but he would have meetings in his office; he would also attend the CRA's Christmas party and the Evening Standard's 1,000 most influential people awards.</p> <p>But he was concerned that socialising with journalists would create a \"perception\" issue.</p> <p>He says his view is not necessarily the right one. \"There are two schools of thought,\" he says about relations with the media.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p>3.37pm: Godwin's opening remarks note that following the Macpherson inquiry into the investigation into the death of Stephen Lawrence, the Met was perceived as a \"closed and secretive organisation\".</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p>3.33pm: The inquiry has resumed and <strong>Tim Godwin</strong> has taken the stand.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p>3.24pm: Quick has now finished his evidence and the inquiry is taking a short break.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p>3.23pm: So, did Sir Paul Stephenson offer to resign over the Damian Green affair or not?</p> <p>Neil Garnham, QC for the Met, asks about the meeting on 1 December 2008 with Sir Paul Stephenson.</p> <p>Garnham asks if it was correct that Stephenson had told Quick he was not going to renew his contract the following April, not that he was going to resign.</p> <p>Quick stands his ground. \"He told me he had written his resignation out,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p>3.19pm: Jay asks Quick what he hypothetically would have done had he been in charge following the Guardian's phone-hacking relevations on 9 July 2009.</p> <p>\"The Guardian were challenging very strongly the first investigation, I would like to think I would have concerned myself with what the first investigation had or hadn't revealed and whether there was any substance to these allegations.\"</p> <p>He adds he \"certainly had concerns at the time that an inquiry was ruled out at an early stage.\"</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p>3.19pm: Quick says he knew from his experience in the Met of that \"risky interface between the police and journalists who are in a fiercely commercial environment seeking scoops, exclusives and stories\".</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p>3.13pm: Quick says on at least two occasions when he was invited to drinks at a wine bar near Scotland Yard, he saw Yates, Fedorcio and Stephenson having drinks with Lucy Panton of the News of the World and Mike Sullivan of the Sun.</p> <p>He said he also recalled Yates in social situations with the Daily Mail's Stephen Wright. He adds he was surprised as Wright had written a number of articles critical of Blair and the Met. </p> <p>Quick is asked if he believes Yates briefed Wright, but says he doesn't know.</p> <p>He says such socialising had perception of looking inappropriate.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p>3.12pm: Quick is asked about his contact with journalists, and says he didn't socialise with them. He adds that his approach was to keep relationships formal, transparent and diaried.</p> <p>When he returned to the Met as assistant commissioner, he was briefed that there was an established relationship between ACSO (special operations) and the Crime Reporters' Association.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p>3.08pm: Quick said he considered resigning and decided to do so, but before he had actually done so the mayor announced the acceptance of his resignation on TV.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p>3.06pm: Quick is now being asked about a notorious photograph of him entering Downing Street with a briefing note on counter-terrorism on display on 8 April 2009.</p> <p>He explains that he was handed a sheath of papers by his staff that morning and he noticed as his car made its way down Downing Street that the notes were marked \"secret\".</p> <p>It was unusual for any secret documents to be handed to him in loose form. He was reading the notes in his car when the door of No 10 was opened and his natural reaction was to jump out of the car and go inside. </p> <p>Inadvertently, he left one of the \"secret\" papers on display.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p>3.00pm: Leveson says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/dec/22/police-damian-green\">an article appeared in the Guardian on 22 December 2008</a> that quoted a well-placed Conservative as saying \"Bob Quick is behind this. I'm going to fucking get him this time.\" It reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bob Quick moved quickly this morning to declare a truce with the Conservative party after it became clear that David Cameron had him in his sights.</p> <p>An early morning appearance by the Tory leader on LBC Radio, in which he demanded an apology from the Met's counter-terrorism chief, prompted Quick to issue an an unreserved apology. This was immediately accepted by Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, who said the Tories were keen to move on.</p> <p>But the matter will not end there; it has provided conclusive proof that the Conservatives are at war with senior figures in the Met. Many Tories are saying that it will take the appointment of an outsider, possibly Sir Hugh Orde from Northern Ireland, who started his career at the Met, to repair the damage.</p> <p>The Tories have long had Quick in their sights because he was one of the main officers who explained \u2013 some would say attempted to sell \u2013 the government's controversial plan to detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days.</p> <p>David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, took particular offence at one briefing with Quick when he appeared to be unfamiliar with one of the main arguments against the 42 day plan. Civil rights campaigners said there was no need for a change in the law because of the so called \"threshold test\", which exists already.</p> <p>This allows the authorities to charge a terror suspect on weaker evidence than would be needed in normal criminal cases.</p> <p>The Tories emphatically deny having briefed the Mail on Sunday that Quick's wife ran a wedding chauffeur car business which sparked his outburst.</p> <p>But one well placed Tory said after Damian Green's arrest: \"Bob Quick is behind this. I'm going to fucking get him this time.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 89 --> <p>2.58pm: Quick says his wife \"had no altermative but to wind down the business\".</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p>2.54pm: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1102242/Top-terror-chiefs-car-hire-firm-operating-licence.html\">The Mail on Sunday ran a follow-up story the following week</a> titled \"Top terror chief's car hire firm is operating without a licence\". </p> <blockquote> <p>Britain's top anti-terror police chief faces more embarrassing questions over a luxury car hire business run from his home which appears to be operating illegally and is being investigated by the local council.</p> <p>The business, run by the wife of Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick, the officer who sanctioned the highly controversial raid on the House of Commons office of Tory MP Damian Green, could face prosecution and a fine of up to \u00a33,000.</p> <p>Inquiries by this newspaper have established that the business, which hires out vintage Rolls-Royces and Mr Quick's 130mph Jensen Interceptor for about \u00a3500 a day, does not have an operator's licence.</p> <p>This could have a bearing on the validity of its passenger insurance policies.</p> <p>The business, Aphrodite Wedding Services, also appears to have broken the law on two more counts \u2013 failing to obtain a private-hire licence for its vehicles and to register its drivers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Quick points out that no licence was necessary.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p>2.53pm: Sean O'Neill of the Times has just tweeted:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-in-reply-to=\"177401682240602113\"> <p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mad_as_Hell_UK\">Mad_as_Hell_UK</a> backdrop to all this is who was pro or anti Ian Blair ...

However, the Jensen was not offered for hire.</p> <p>She became suspicious about calls, which she believed to have come from the Daily Mail, asking to hire the Jensen.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p>2.41pm: Quick is asked about attacks by the media on the wedding chauffeur service his wife had been running.</p> <p>A client had got a call from the Mail on Sunday and they wanted to know about Quick, whether he drove the cars, and whether they used police officers in uniform as drivers.</p> <p>He says the business was not of interest, but it was his connection to the business.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p>2.40pm: The Cabinet Office has subsequently got some of Johnston's report redacted.</p> <p>When support from the Cabinet Office for Quick's claim that it was that body that thought it was a criminal matter was sought, \"it was not forthcoming\".</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p>2.38pm: Stephenson then asked him to \"stop the investigation\" which Quick believed was not appropriate.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p>2.37pm: Quick says Paul Stephenson and Godwin seemed \"very preoccupied during the meeting about the negative media attention\".</p> <p>\"I sensed it was having an enormous impact about how people were thinking about this case,\" says Quick.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p>2.36pm: Ian Johnston launched a review in December and he was given just two weeks to report.</p> <p>Godwin asked Quick to attend a meeting to discuss the findings.</p> <p>The report found that the decision to arrest Green was \"disproportionate\". Quick says he was surprised at this.</p> <p>the Cabinet Office at the time believed it was a \"criminal matter\"; they had been investigating the leaks for sometime without success and the person leaking had access to very sensitive information.</p> <p>\"I found it strange that there was this emphasis constantly that it was not a criminal matter,\" says Quick.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p>2.33pm: Index on Censorship has just tweeted:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>Quick says he knew of D Mail journo who had \"done a pretty good job\" of trying to \"demolish\" Met over a few years <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%2523leveson\">#leveson</a></p> <p>\u2014 IndexLeveson (@IndexLeveson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IndexLeveson/status/177400551900848129\" data-datetime=\"2012-03-07T14:29:22+00:00\">March 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>Quick says he had \"concerns\" over relationships between Met and certain journos <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%2523leveson\">#leveson</a></p> <p>\u2014 IndexLeveson (@IndexLeveson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IndexLeveson/status/177400694372962304\" data-datetime=\"2012-03-07T14:29:56+00:00\">March 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>When asked by Jay, Quick names Mail journo as Stephen Wright <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%2523leveson\">#leveson</a></p> <p>\u2014 IndexLeveson (@IndexLeveson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IndexLeveson/status/177400850094891008\" data-datetime=\"2012-03-07T14:30:33+00:00\">March 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>Quick adds that Yates was close to Wright <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%2523leveson\">#leveson</a></p> <p>\u2014 IndexLeveson (@IndexLeveson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IndexLeveson/status/177400982412603392\" data-datetime=\"2012-03-07T14:31:04+00:00\">March 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 76 --> <p>2.31pm: Jay suggests that there was a job open at the top and senior staff knifing each other was one way of getting ahead.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p>2.30pm: Quick says he believes the review of his investigation was convened \"in haste and air of semi-panic\" and was a result of pressure being applied to the Met.</p> <p>There were reports attributed to someone close to the acting commissioner saying he didn't support the arrests, claims that \"really troubled me\".</p> <p>He says the report in the Daily Telegraph that he had a row with Stephenson was \"false\".</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p>2.25pm: Quick had concerns with some of the media reports.</p> <p>Yates asked to see him in the office and told him that his inquiry was \"doomed\" because the CPS would withdraw its support for the investigation as it did in the cash for honours inquiry.</p> <p>Quick says he couldn't stop unless there wasn't a legitimate reason for dropping the investigation.</p> <p>\"We had just seized a load of evidence that we hadn't the opportunity to examine yet \u2026 it didn't seem a tenable argument.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p>2.24pm: There was a meeting the following day with Sir Paul Stephenson and the acting deputy commissioner Tim Godwin.</p> <p>Quick says he could see why Stephenson would have to resign.</p> <p>He couldn't see the police were doing anything other than their duty to investigate wrongdoing at the Home Office.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p>2.22pm: When Quick briefed Sir Paul Stephenson prior to the arrest, they discussed that the arrest would be \"controversial\". </p> <p>However, Quick says he was not prepared for the heavy criticism and \"some of the reporting was a surprise\".</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p>2.16pm: Green was arrested at his Kent constituency and was brought to London but after initially saying he was \"too tired\" to be interviewed, he agreed to be questioned, but gave a \"no comment\" interview.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p>2.16pm: Quick is asked about the circumstances leading to the arrest of Green. Former DAC John McDowall was involved. The advice was that a search of a parliamentary office would be lawful.</p> <p>There was then a discussion as to whether it was appropriate to arrest an MP or whether to invite him to attend a police station voluntarily.</p> <p>However, a number of pieces of information came to light via Galley and therefore the \"gold group\" within Scotland Yard was unanimous the only way forward was to arrest. (The \"gold group\" is a senior strategic decision making body of senior staff. Quick was chairman of the group.)</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p>2.11pm: Jay asks Quick about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/dec/01/damian-green-q-and-a\">the Damian Green leaks case</a>. </p> <p>Quick says he asked Cressida Dick to conduct a scoping exercise after claims junior Home Office civil servant Christopher Galley was allegedly passing information to Tory MP Green.</p> <p>Galley admitted that four of the six leaks were linked to him. He claimed that David Davis introducted him to Green and that the MP said he was seeking \"dirt on the Labour government\".</p> <p>Galley's claim was he wanted a job in the Tory parliamentary party and Green had given him \"positive signals\" about helping him.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p>2.06pm: The inquiry has resumed and Bob Quick is continuing his evidence.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>1.03pm: The inquiry has now broken for lunch and will resume at 2pm.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p>1.01pm: Quick discusses an article in the Mail on Sunday by then shadow home secretary David Davis that he says misrepresented the Met's position on detention without charge.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p>12.50pm: Quick says he asked Yates for access to his phone records, but the assistant commissioner refused, saying \"I am too well connected\". When pressed on this Yates said, \"No \u2026&#xa0;I am very well connected.\"</p> <p>Quick says he thought this was \"a bit of theatre\".</p> <p>The matter was raised with commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, who made it clear he would not be taking it further.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p>12.49pm: One of the recommendations in Quick's report was \"a retrospective analysis\" of Yates's telephone records to corroborate his view that the assistant commissioner was not leaking.</p> <p>Jay says that this was a rather \"tepid\" recommendation. Quick protests that whether it was \"tepid or not it was clear\". And this was standard practice when the Met suspected someone was leaking.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p>12.48pm: The former chief secretary to the cabinet, Sir Gus O'Donnell, raised concerns regarding unauthorised disclosures and he was specifically concerned about assistant commissioner John Yates's relationship with the media.</p> <p>Quick agreed to investigate over the weekend and submitted a report to the deputy commissioner on the Monday to ensure the inquiry was sound and \"there were no leaks or malpractice\".</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p>12.46pm: Quick is asked about a review of unauthorised disclosures of information.</p> <p>He said he saw no evidence in his review of deliberate leaking of information.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p>12.39pm: Quick says he recommended an investigation into police corruption, in a report that was submitted to Andy Hayman.</p> <p>However, Hayman had reservations based on potential evidential difficulties and decided that this was too \"risky\".</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p>12.36pm: Intelligence revealed payments of between \u00a3500 and \u00a32,000 were being made to officers and the journalists were claiming those back from their employers.</p> <p>The police unit formed the view that journalists would either be falsely be claiming this money back or the newspapers were \"somehow complicit\" in the pauyments.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p>12.36pm: Quick became concerned about the relationship between journalists and officers suspected of corruption.</p> <p>\"It became apparent that some officers were being bribed for stories,\" he says.</p> <p>He decided to investigate the payments to officers.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p>12.35pm: Quick's written statement refers to a listening device used for \"covert investigation\" against those connected to Southern.</p> <p>The investigation ended with the arrest of individuals.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p>12.34pm: The anti-corruption probe was called Operation Nigeria.</p> <p>It identified a number of journalists from papers including the Sun and the News of the World as having a direct relationship with Southern Investigations.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p>12.33pm: Jay asks about an allegations regarding Southern Investigations, the firm set up by murdered private eye Daniel Morgan.</p> <p>In 1999 Quick was head of the anti-corruption command.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p>12.31pm: The BBC's Ross HAwkins has just tweeted:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>Further Bob Quick basic reading <a href=\"http://t.co/lybmePHP\" title=\"http://t.co/lybmePHP\">t.co/lybmePHP</a> and <a href=\"http://t.co/gFhdbLdT\" title=\"http://t.co/gFhdbLdT\">t.co/gFhdbLdT</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%2523leveson\">#leveson</a></p> <p>\u2014 Ross Hawkins (@rosschawkins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rosschawkins/status/177370589990891521\" data-datetime=\"2012-03-07T12:30:18+00:00\">March 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 54 --> <p>12.31pm: The inquiry has now resumed. The next witness is Bob Quick.</p> <p>Quick was chief constable of Surrey police in 2004, and returned to the Met in March 2008 where he was assistant commissioner specialist operations. He followed Andy Hayman in that post.</p> <p>He resigned from the Met in May 2009.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p>12.26pm: The inquiry has resumed and <strong>Bob Quick</strong> takes the stand.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p>12.15pm: Blair has now finished giving evidence and the inquiry is taking a short break.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p>12.09pm: Blair quotes the legal word \"recuse\". He says he recused himself from the \"cash for honours\" investigation because he had a high level of contact with politicians, all of which was professional.</p> <p>He suggests that Yates, who openly declared himself a friend of the former deputy editor of the News of the World, could have recused himself from decisions on phone hacking for the same reason.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p>12.07pm: Blair is asked if he has any comment on Hayman and Yates and their level of contact with News International management.</p> <p>\"Large number of dinners and large amounts of alcohol, that would worry me,\" says Blair.</p> <p>He says there are two problems: first, junior officers must look at this and ask if it is proper use of public money; secondly, there is the \"perception\" that the high level of contact and the decision not to investigate would be connected in the public's mind.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p>12.06pm: Blair says of the Filkin report:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Elizabeth Filkin's comment that contact is permissible but not unconditional should be nailed to the front door of the police station.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, Blair says he disagrees with a whole series of injunctions and subclauses about how you should deal with the press rather than anybody else.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p>12.04pm: Blair say he believes Yates was not acting to protect News International, but his frequent contact with journalists and executives there was an issue.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Do I believe that John Yates took that decision [not to reopen hacking inquiry] in order to placate that organisation? No I don't, but his difficulty is the number of contacts and I think that is a problem. </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 47 --> <p>12.03pm: Blair says that Peter Clarke was extremely well respected and perhaps Yates's decision was an extreme example of \"group think\".</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p>11.58am: Leveson says he realises that is is invidious to criticise but he has to consider the issue and wants to do it with the benefit of Blair's experience.</p> <p>Blair says he doesn't know why John Yates dismissed the Guardian report within six hours and decided there was no reason to reopen the investigation.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In John Yates's expression, it was a poor decision \u2026 from what I can see, that decision was just too quick. Why could you not have gone back with all those allegations and looked further at what the material did actually say?</p> <p>I don't quite understand why John took that decision with the speed which he did.</p> <p>That decision appears to be too hasty.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 45 --> <p>11.56am: By the time the Guardian reported that phone hacking was extensive in July 2009, Blair was no longer the commissioner.</p> <p>Blair says it is \"invidious to criticised from the outside\".</p> <p>When he read <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05hacking-t.html?pagewanted=all\">the New York Times revelations in September 2010</a>, he says he thought \"Whoa, this has got to be investigated, it is so wide.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>11.51am: Blair is asked about a call he made to home secretary David Blunkett to let him know about phone hacking.</p> <p>Jay asks if this shows that he was cognisant of the extent of hacking.</p> <p>Blair says Blunkett was \"wildly concerned about his personal privacy\" and so he asked in advance whether the home secretary's name was on the list of potential victims.</p> <p>He adds he was unaware that other names linked to Blunkett were on the list.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p>11.49am: Blair says he was told about Goodman and Mulcaire pleading guilty to phone hacking offences in November 2006.</p> <p>However he says at the time terrorism was such a threat, the force was not considering much else in the way of serious crime.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We had closed Heathrow airport in the middle of the holiday season, there was enormous pressure. It really was the only show in town.

The only reason he was told was because the investigation concerned the royal princes. </p> <p>He says listening to voicemail messages wasn't something that people had heard of before.</p> <p>\"I don't think people were clear about how it was done and there was a discussions of whether it was an offence at all,\" he adds.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>11.26am: The inquiry is now taking a short break.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>11.25am: Jay asks Blair if he ever suspected that Fedorcio was the source of the leaks. </p> <p>Blair says he doesn't want to say, but adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>I am concerned by the evidence that Mr Paddick gave about his conversations with [journalist] Mr Hyder to you earlier on about Dick briefing against me, so I obviously have to reflect on that.

I gather he did explain that he still retained a post in relation to ACPO's media advisory chair. I'm not sure I find that sufficient in this case.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>11.16am: Blair says anti-terrorism chief Andy Hayman was investigated in 2007 over alleged leaks arising from a case in Birmingham into the conspiracy to kidnap a Muslim soldier and behead him and put it on the internet.</p> <p>The story broke in the media so early, there was an inquiry into how it got there; telephone records were examined.</p> <p>Blair refers to this in his book and notes that the records showed a \"high volume of traffic on [Hayman's] telephone of telephone numbers belonging to journalists\".</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>11.12am: Blair believes some police officers gossiped too much with journalists \u2013 Leveson says this constitutes an \"accidental leak\".</p> <p>\"I think there were too many meetings with journalists which were unrecorded and unnecessary,\" says Blair.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>11.11am: Blair says he has made inquiries about Operation Elveden, the the Met's investigation into inappropriate payments to police and other public servants, ahead of his inquiry appearance and says the officers who may be arrested were more likely to be junior.</p> <p>He adds that he has been given an assurance, \"as of a few weeks ago\", that it is was not likely there would be the arrest of senior colleagues as part of Elveden.</p> <p>Blair says he finds it \"inconceivable\" that senior officers would take money from the press.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>11.09am: Blair says there were increasing leaks to the media during his time as commissioner, from within management and the level below.</p> <p>He adds that he did not suspect they were passing on information to journalists for money.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>11.05am: Under Blair's proposed policy, someone in the police force who may have worked in the media before would be free to return to the media.</p> <p>He says, for example, if the police recruited someone from the Daily Mirror to work in the press office, it couldn't bar them from returning to work at the paper.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>11.03am: Blair says he has never written for a News International paper, \"certainly not for payment\".</p> <p>His book was serialised by the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>Blair believes a \"restriction period of two years\" should apply for all staff preventing retired officers from working in other businesses.</p> <p>Leveson says this issue is particularly relevant to the police because they can retire so young.</p> <p>Blair says the pension regime makes it more or less compulsory to leave when officers are younger than normal retirement age because they could get less money the longer they leave retirement.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>11.01am: Blair discusses the arrests policy in relation to terrorist threats including the airline bomb plot in 2006.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We were facing a level of terrorist threat that we had never seen before and we believed we were trying to deal with this with some relatively outdated legislation because the level of threat and atrocity was so appalling that we had to move faster than we would like, for example the airliners plot. Had seven or eight airlines blown up over the Atlantic this would have been Britain's 9/11 for the very least.</p> <p>That left us having to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>11.00am: Blair says the force used to have a rulebook on behaviour called \"General orders\". </p> <p>It was, he says, an \"enormous book \u2013 a description of all the things you shouldn't do\".</p> <p>But he adds: \"I don't think anyone took any notice because it was too complex.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>10.56am: Blair is talking about how his 15-year-old son got work experience at the Sun.</p> <p>\"The current debate over internshnips was not playing at the time,\" he says. \"I had a whole series of people interning around my office \u2026 it was a perfectly normal process.\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>10.53am: Blair continues: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Met has about 100 horses, of which I assume a regular proportion are released, and this is a regular event, because the horse is still well, but it is not strong enough to do the work that it's required to do, and the Met, I presume, quite understandably, doesn't want to put them down.

I have absolutely no recollection of that.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>10.49am: Blair says he became acquainted with quite a few print journalists including Will Lewis, who was the son in law of someone he knew; Brooks; and Veronica Wadley, the former editor of the Evening Standard. </p> <p>He knew broadcast journalists less well, with the exception of BBC director general Mark Thompson, who was a close neighbour.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>10.46am: Blair records four meetings or exchanges with Rebekah Brooks: a phone call in 2005, a meeting in 2006, a lunch in 2007 and a further exchange after she ran the headline \"Blair is doomed\" in the Sun. </p> <p>His wife met Brooks twice: the first time at John Stevens's leaving do; the second time was following the \"Blair is doomed\" headline when she told Brooks \"Nice headline, Rebekah.\" He says this left Brooks speechless.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>10.46am: Blair says he didn't give similar briefings to any other paper.</p> <p>\"I don't really know why Dick thought this was such a good idea with this particular group,\" he adds.</p> <p>He says he didn't think a meeting with the Daily Mail would have been \"terribly successful\" because it was hostile to him.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>10.41am: Jay asks about the gifts and hospitality register.</p> <p>Blair had a lunch with Les Hinton, the former boss of News International, on 18 September 2006.</p> <p>On 6 June 2007, he had lunch at Cicconi's with News of the World editor Colin Myler, deputy editor and Met PR chief Dick Fedorcio.</p> <p>They says he wanted to get across his frustration that the IPCC's \"Stockwell 2\" report had taken two years to produce.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>10.40am: Blair says journalists are always looking for a scoop, which is why he woud not have a meeting with a reporter without a press officer present.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>10.38am: Blair says he has an understanding of off-the-record briefings.

He says he thinks the journalist was more interested in dramatic events rather than the day-to-day workings of his office.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>10.27am: Blair, unlike other former commissioners the Leveson inquiry has questioned, says he didn't generally socialise with journalists.</p> <p>\"I didn't have any dinners at all with editors or journalists with an exception with one friend who was a friend before I became commissioner, which was entirely social,\" he adds.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>10.27am: Blair says he tried very hard to get the \"heroics and the dedication of some of the staff\" across in a way that interested the press but the media generally were not interested in this type of story.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>10.26am: Blair says some of the police contact with journalists involved \"pretty heavy drinking\" but he is referring to a culture from a long time ago.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>10.23am: Blair says when he became commissioner he felt the staff spent too much time worrying about what the press was going to say next. </p> <p>He felt the Met management board should spend less time with the media.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>10.19am: Robert Jay QC, counsel for the inquiry, reads from the Daily Mail, which branded Blair \"Labour's favourite cop\" and a \"politically correct\" commissioner.</p> <p>In June 2005, he says, the Mail misquoted his evidence to an employment tribunal. \"This is the norm for public life, but it is dispiriting,\" Blair says.</p> <p>He says media coverage is \"cumulatively depressing\" as the worst possible angle is sought to be put on stories. </p> <p>It is \"exhausting\" at times, Blair says in a statement being read to the inquiry. </p> <p>Jay says Blair's comments are arguably resonant of the evidence given by Alastair Campbell to the inquiry.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>10.18am: Blair says the UK has borrowed from the US where policing has become politicised.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't know how the political genie can be put back in the bottle \u2026 My sense is about the way in which crime became a dominant issue in US politics and they have much less distinction between the operational independence of police and the way police chiefs are appointed and dismissed \u2026</p> <p>We have some difficulty. If one looks at the coverage of crime in newspapers, it is enormous and politiucians are going to take note of that. </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>10.16am: Blair says in his written statement that the police are \"not part of the Whitehall machine\".</p> <p>However, he thinks the police have become \"part of the nexus of political debate\" with home affairs correspondents rather than crime correspondents reporting his and Sir Paul Stephenson's resignations.</p> <p>He says some journalists treat New Scotland Yard as part of the Whitehall machine, which it is not.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>10.10am: Blair says the Metropolitan police is a fundamentally different environment to work compared with Surrey, and Thames Valley police had just two or three staff in the press office compared with 70 staff in the Met.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>10.06am: the inquiry has begun and <strong>Lord Blair</strong> takes the stand.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.02am: Lisa O'Carroll has just tweeted:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%2523Leveson\">#Leveson</a> Up first we believe, Lord Blair.

She said that the Sun newspaper was responsible for creating a \"network of corrupted officials\" and creating a \"culture of illegal payments\" to officials from the police, Ministry of Defence and other public bodies.</p> <p>In a statement about her investigation she included details of \"multiple payments\" by the Sun journalists to public officials, with one individual receiving \u00a380,000, while one journalist, she said, drew more than \u00a3150,000 over the years to pay sources, including public officials.</p> <p>The stories that resulted from these disclosures were \"salacious gossip\", she said, and not in the public interest. She also gave details of how the relative of one arrested public official acted as a conduit to hide the cheque payment to that individual.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the attorney general has received at least one complaint raising concerns that Akers's evidence \u2013 given in the midst of a criminal inquiry \u2013 could be in breach of the Contempt of Court Act and could prejudice further legal action against any of the individuals arrested. Lawyers for the attorney are investigating.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the attorney general told the Guardian: \"Evidence given during the Leveson inquiry has been drawn to the attention of the attorney general's office.

A stream of other claims involving free holidays, gifts and other favours have chipped away at Wulff's reputation, given birth to the verb \"to Wulff\" \u2013 to be evasive without telling a clear lie \u2013 and prompted a wave of debate about power and privilege.

      "bodyText": "Nicolas Sarkozy has declared there are too many foreigners in France, deliberately using extreme-right rhetoric to regain ground in his difficult re-election battle. The French president is already under attack by religious leaders and from within his own party for veering to the right and stoking anti-Muslim sentiment by forcing the marginal topic of halal meat into the centre of his campaign. He has now vowed to cut immigration by half and limit state benefits for legal migrants. \"Our system of integration is working increasingly badly, because we have too many foreigners on our territory and we can no longer manage to find them accommodation, a job, a school,\" he said in a three-hour appearance on a TV politics debate show. Sarkozy, who lags behind the Socialist frontrunner, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is courting voters from Marine Le Pen's extreme-right Front National more than ever. But the tactic appeared to have backfired this week. In what newspaper columnists called \"sick-making\" and \"grotesque\" electioneering, Sarkozy pushed fears of a supposed secret Islamisation of the dinner plate. He reopened a row, begun last month by Le Pen, over whether meat ritually slaughtered according to Muslim religious standards was being sold on the wider market to unsuspecting non-Muslimconsumers. The prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, is holding emergency talks to smooth relations with Muslim leaders and the Jewish community after wading into the row by suggesting there was little point in Jews or Muslims eating kosher or halal. \"Religions should think about whether they should keep traditions that don't have much in common with today's state of science, technology and health problems,\" he said. Richard Pasquier, head of the Jewish umbrella group the Crif, not usually critical of the government, said he was \"shocked\" and \"stupefied\" by Fillon's comments. Mohamed Moussaoui, head of France's biggest Muslim body, said he could not accept that \"Muslims serve as scapegoats in this campaign\". Salima Saa, a new figurehead for diversity in Sarkozy's own UMP party and campaign team, criticised \"a discourse of prejudice and stigmatisation\". The halal row began last month when Le Pen, who is running on an anti-immigration platform and polling third behind Hollande and Sarkozy, announced \u2013 wrongly \u2013 that 100% of all meat in the Paris region was halal and encroaching on the French way of life. Meat industry representatives said the figure was incorrect. Sarkozy initially played down the issue. But, desperate to court Le Pen's voters, he later seized on it, stressing in rousing speeches at campaign rallies that halal meat options should not be available in state school canteens. He said halal meat was French people's major concern and number one topic of conversation, despite the economic crisis and record unemployment. Sarkozy's close ally and interior minister, Claude Gu\u00e9ant, added to the controversy, saying that if foreign residents were given the right to vote for local councillors \u2013 as mooted by the left \u2013 halal food options could become \"obligatory\" in school canteens. The link was implicit: people who eat halal were foreign. In his latest TV appearance on Tuesday, Sarkozy tried to row back from the polemic, tempering his call for compulsory meat-labelling to a voluntary scheme. The Muslim community in France, estimated at between 4 million and 6 million, is the biggest in western Europe. Hollande warned against using the issue of halal or kosher meat for electioneering. \"Our Muslim and Jewish fellow citizens feel hurt, whatever their political allegiances might be,\" he said. Sarkozy is hoping that a rush of media appearances and a major campaign rally in a Paris suburb this weekend will draw a line under a difficult 10 days in which he has failed to overtake Hollande in the polls and was pelted with eggs by protesters on a campaign trip to the Basque country. The latest poll for CSA put Hollande on 30%, Sarkozy on 28% and Le Pen on 15% for the first round vote on 22 April. The poll found Hollande would beat Sarkozy in the 6 May second round run-off by 56% to 44%.",

He reopened a row, begun last month by Le Pen, over whether meat ritually slaughtered according to Muslim religious standards was being sold on the wider market to unsuspecting non-Muslimconsumers.</p> <p>The prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, is holding emergency talks to smooth relations with Muslim leaders and the Jewish community after wading into the row by suggesting there was little point in Jews or Muslims eating kosher or halal. \"Religions should think about whether they should keep traditions that don't have much in common with today's state of science, technology and health problems,\" he said.</p> <p>Richard Pasquier, head of the Jewish umbrella group the Crif, not usually critical of the government, said he was \"shocked\" and \"stupefied\" by Fillon's comments. Mohamed Moussaoui, head of France's biggest Muslim body, said he could not accept that \"Muslims serve as scapegoats in this campaign\". Salima Saa, a new figurehead for diversity in Sarkozy's own UMP party and campaign team, criticised \"a discourse of prejudice and stigmatisation\".</p> <p>The halal row began last month when Le Pen, who is running on an anti-immigration platform and polling third behind Hollande and Sarkozy, announced \u2013 wrongly \u2013 that 100% of all meat in the Paris region was halal and encroaching on the French way of life.</p> <p>Meat industry representatives said the figure was incorrect. Sarkozy initially played down the issue. But, desperate to court Le Pen's voters, he later seized on it, stressing in rousing speeches at campaign rallies that halal meat options should not be available in state school canteens.</p> <p>He said halal meat was French people's major concern and number one topic of conversation, despite the economic crisis and record unemployment. Sarkozy's close ally and interior minister, Claude Gu\u00e9ant, added to the controversy, saying that if foreign residents were given the right to vote for local councillors \u2013 as mooted by the left \u2013 halal food options could become \"obligatory\" in school canteens. The link was implicit: people who eat halal were foreign. In his latest TV appearance on Tuesday, Sarkozy tried to row back from the polemic, tempering his call for compulsory meat-labelling to a voluntary scheme.</p> <p>The Muslim community in France, estimated at between 4 million and 6 million, is the biggest in western Europe. Hollande warned against using the issue of halal or kosher meat for electioneering. \"Our Muslim and Jewish fellow citizens feel hurt, whatever their political allegiances might be,\" he said.</p> <p>Sarkozy is hoping that a rush of media appearances and a major campaign rally in a Paris suburb this weekend will draw a line under a difficult 10 days in which he has failed to overtake Hollande in the polls and was pelted with eggs by protesters on a campaign trip to the Basque country.</p> <p>The latest poll for CSA put Hollande on 30%, Sarkozy on 28% and Le Pen on 15% for the first round vote on 22 April. The poll found Hollande would beat Sarkozy in the 6 May second round run-off by 56% to 44%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The next iPad? It's going to be called iPad 3, there will be just two versions (with mobile broadband, and just with Wi-Fi), and no 7 inch version. And the technology giant will renew its assault on the internet TV market \u2013 but will hold back from launching an Apple-branded TV set, instead choosing to launch an app-enabled set-top box. That's the opinion coalesced from a crowd of more than 6,000 Guardian website visitors who took part in a \"wisdom of the crowd\" exercise on the blog. Apple is preparing to unveil two new versions of its flagship iPad which will be dubbed \"iPad 3\", according to a survey of 6,000 Guardian readers. In the poll, which ran for just over 27 hours, more than three-quarters of voters said Apple would stick with a single iPad, with both Wi-Fi and 3G versions. There won't be a 7in version. The name? Though \"iPad HD\" has been gaining currency elsewhere, people seem to think \"iPad 3\" will be the moniker. And though speculation is mounting elsewhere on the web that the next-generation iPad will include haptic technology, a display operated by a heightened form of touch sensation, only 4% expect the new iPad to introduce haptic technology. Most \u2013 25.1% \u2013 said the upgraded tablet computer would come with a \"retina display\", offering four times as many pixels as the iPad 2. And it'll have a quad-core processor (19.8%) and versions of its photo processing programs. Microsoft Office for the iPad? An outside chance \u2013 9.3% backed it. Apple has remained typically tight-lipped about what it will unveil at a press conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, scheduled for 10am Pacific time (6pm London time). The new iPads will be available from 16 March, according to the Apple-watching website 9to5mac.com. The website said that Apple stores across the US are gearing up for an event on that date next week, which will include the opening of a new store at Harrods in London. Apple has been tipped to preparing its own TV set, a radical move that would complete Apple's move from the computer to the living room. (In the poll, although only 58.8% expect a move in TV, 71.2% expect a set-top box rather than an actual set.) And the new Apple TV? App-enabled (35.9%), able to connect to all of the internet (29.6%) and including plenty of hard drive storage (22.6%) instead of the current 8GB. Guardian readers have done well in previous iPad crowdsourcing: ahead of the original launch, in 2010, the crowd reckoned that there would be one model (correct), with a screen size below 10.3in (correct), called the iPad (correct), weighing about a kilogram (it was a bit less). Then again, people thought it would play Flash content (wrong), have USB and ethernet ports (wrong), an OLED screen (wrong), and cost about \u00a3800. Meanwhile interest from online retailers in Apple's announcement has peaked in the past 48 hours, after a new category named \"Catalogues\" appeared in the company's app store. It has been speculated that Apple will encourage well-known retailers to digitise their entire product catalogues for iPhone and iPad-users to be able to purchase items direct from the store. Earlier on Wednesday, Apple was crowned the world's most valuable brand, valued at $70.6bn (\u00a344.8bn), according to the Brand Finance Global 500 study published on Wednesday. The annual study said Apple rose seven places in the 12 months following the launch of the iPad 2, the iPhone 4s and a new operating system for Mac computers. \"The meteoric rise we have witnessed over the last 12 months is nothing short of staggering,\" said David Haigh, chief executive of Brand Finance. \"Today's release of the third generation iPad is critical to Apple maintaining its stronghold of the tablet market and many people wait with baited breath to see if this version will be about evolution or revolution.\" According to the Brand Finance Global 500 released on Wednesday, Apple has a brand value of $70bn (\u00a344.44bn), ahead of Google ($47.5bn), Microsoft ($45.8bn), IBM ($39.1bn) and Amazon ($26.7bn).

      "bodyText": "Prince Harry's headline-grabbing antics with 100m world record holder and Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt is estimated to have provided Puma with a promotional moment worth millions of pounds. The third in line to the throne made TV news bulletins and front-page news all over the world after cheating in a tongue-in-cheek race against the Jamaican sprinter and posing for shots performing Bolt's trademark \"lightning\" gesture. During the event, on the first of a four-day trip to Jamaica on behalf of the Queen, Harry wore a tracksuit in Jamaica's national colours which clearly display the Puma logo on the shirt and tracksuit pants. \"The request to wear the Jamaican athletes' training T-shirt was made by Prince Harry, but with the backing of the royal household and the Jamaican government,\" said Miguel Head, press secretary to Prince Harry. \"Prince Harry asked to wear the T-shirt as a way of signalling respect for the Jamaican team. \"The fact that the T-shirt contained branding \u2013 as most sports kit does \u2013 was a coincidence and was not a factor at all in the decision.\" The event has received international coverage on TV, online and in print media. In the UK the duo were splashed across the front page of many national newspapers on Wednesday, with all titles carrying a single- or double-page spread inside, with Harry's \"lighting bolt\" gesture inadvertently highlighting the Puma logo on his chest. \"You cannot buy brand ads on the front page like that, you just can't \u2013 it is immensely valuable for Puma,\" said Amy King, head of press investment at media buying agency MPG. \"With all the national press, TV and radio covering the Prince's banter with Olympian Bolt, Puma will have received millions of pounds of free advertising and all for the price of a tracksuit.\" Bolt is one of the hottest global properties in the advertising and sponsorship industry. He is currently appearing in TV campaigns in the UK for brands including Virgin Media and the Jamaica Tourist Board. Puma, which despite its globally recognised brand lacks the marketing firepower of Nike and Adidas, has a sponsorship deal with Bolt worth tens of millions of dollars a year. Bolt is already a global star but the timing of his appearance with Prince Harry just months before the London Olympics is viewed as a coup for Puma. \"This is why the sports equipment companies pay serious money for stars like Bolt \u2013 the brand exposure Puma gets from stunts like this and Bolt's other commercial activity is the gift that keeps on giving, especially in an Olympic year, and is worth millions,\" said the chief executive of sports sponsorship agency Synergy, Tim Crow. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "Aid donors have failed to address long-standing systematic problems in how they respond to disasters and emergencies, despite numerous commitments to reform the international humanitarian aid system, according to a new index that scores governments on the quality of aid provided. Norway, Denmark and Sweden, all relatively small humanitarian aid donors, are the top-ranking countries in the latest Humanitarian Response Index (HRI), published on Wednesday by Dara, an international non-profit organisation based in Spain. The US, the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, is near the bottom of the league, along with Spain, Japan, Luxembourg and Italy. In 2003, donors gathered in Stockholm, Sweden, to draft and endorse the Good humanitarian donorship (GHD) principles to improve co-ordination among donors, make funding more reliable and predictable, and help humanitarian organisations better prepare for crises. But Philip Tamminga, head of the HRI project, says the GHD's lack of clear, measurable targets and indicators, as with the millennium development goals, has meant there have been few tools to assess progress and hold governments to account. Meanwhile, donors have been able to apply different interpretations of the GHD principles and implement different requirements, approaches and levels of funding. The result is nearly a decade of patchy progress, according to the HRI, which analysed 23 donors and how they responded to nine big humanitarian crises in 2010. Italy is ranked last in the league for failing to protect the neutrality and impartiality of its humanitarian aid programme, for opting out of accountability initiatives, and for not contributing its \"fair share\" to UN and Red Cross appeals. Japan received particularly low scores on support for efforts to improve accountability and partner with local organisations. The US scored poorly on indicators for supporting accountability initiatives and programmes to reduce climate-related vulnerability. The HRI report calls on donors to stick to the current reform agenda, but warns that this might not be enough to deal with future challenges. \"Humanitarian needs and challenges will quickly outpace the ability of the current system to address them \u2013 even when it works at its very best,\" said Tamminga. \"What is needed is a new reform agenda, but refocusing less on aid delivery mechanics and more on how to anticipate, prevent, prepare for and mitigate future crises.\" Only 62 cents of every $100 spent on humanitarian aid programmes in 2005-09 went to disaster prevention and preparedness programmes, says the report. Overall, less than 1% of all official government aid \u2013 both development and humanitarian \u2013 went to such programmes. The failure of donors and aid agencies to respond to crises before they develop into humanitarian emergencies came into sharp focus last year with the famine in Somalia. A recent Guardian analysis found more than 70% of humanitarian aid for Somalia and almost 90% of mainstream US and UK media coverage came after the formal UN declaration of famine on 20 July 2011. This year, Oxfam and Save the Children said tens of thousands of deaths could have been avoided if the international community had responded earlier to clear warning signs of an escalating crisis in the region. Australia and Germany are among the few donors engaging with disaster risk reduction efforts, according to the HRI. The UK ranked among the top 10 donors. Its new humanitarian aid policy is also an \"enormously positive step\", said Tamminga. The new policy aims to improve the UK's response to \"slow onset\" crises and build disaster risk reduction plans into all its country programmes. The challenge, says Tamminga, will be translating this new policy into sustained and systematic changes in how assistance is delivered on the ground. In November 2011, a largely positive evaluation of UK funding for climate change resilience projects in Bangladesh said the programme failed to sufficiently hold its partners \u2013 the World Bank and the UN Development Programme \u2013 to account, and that delays and poor co-ordination meant only \u00a313m of the \u00a375m allocated had been spent. The HRI report warns that while more donors are referencing gender concerns in their humanitarian policies, these issues remain largely absent in project proposals and funding allocations, and few ever follow-up on whether they are actually addressed in the programmes they support. \"The message from donors seems to be that gender is an important political commitment, but not a practical priority in humanitarian crises,\" says the report. Last week, the US Agency for International Development (USAid) said it would work to address the unique challenges facing women in crisis and conflict-affected environments, as part of its new gender policy. But Tamminga says it would be wise to wait and see how this new policy is implemented, monitored and evaluated, before claiming it as a success.",

      "body": "<p>Aid donors have failed to address long-standing systematic problems in how they respond to disasters and emergencies, despite numerous commitments to reform the international humanitarian aid system, according to a <a href=\"http://daraint.org/humanitarian-response-index/humanitarian-response-index-2011/\" title=\"\">new index</a> that scores governments on the quality of aid provided.</p> <p>Norway, Denmark and Sweden, all relatively small humanitarian aid donors, are the top-ranking countries in the latest Humanitarian Response Index (HRI), published on Wednesday by Dara, an international non-profit organisation based in Spain. The US, the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, is near the bottom of the league, along with Spain, Japan, Luxembourg and Italy.</p> <p>In 2003, donors gathered in Stockholm, Sweden, to draft and endorse the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=good%20humanitarian%20donorship%202003%20stockholm&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhumanitariandonorship.org%2FLibraries%2FIreland_Doc_Manager%2FEN-23-Principles-and-Good-Practice-of-Humanitarian-Donorship.sflb.ashx&amp;ei=cWRXT56ROMnM0QWH-6DXDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlHdqBU7O9ZnoDzqkrN3KEmCamJg&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Good humanitarian donorship (GHD) principles</a> to improve co-ordination among donors, make funding more reliable and predictable, and help humanitarian organisations better prepare for crises.</p> <p>But Philip Tamminga, head of the HRI project, says the GHD's lack of clear, measurable targets and indicators, as with the millennium development goals, has meant there have been few tools to assess progress and hold governments to account. Meanwhile, donors have been able to apply different interpretations of the GHD principles and implement different requirements, approaches and levels of funding.</p> <p>The result is nearly a decade of patchy progress, according to the HRI, which analysed 23 donors and how they responded to nine big humanitarian crises in 2010.</p> <p>Italy is ranked last in the league for failing to protect the neutrality and impartiality of its humanitarian aid programme, for opting out of accountability initiatives, and for not contributing its \"fair share\" to UN and Red Cross appeals. Japan received particularly low scores on support for efforts to improve accountability and partner with local organisations. The US scored poorly on indicators for supporting accountability initiatives and programmes to reduce climate-related vulnerability.</p> <p>The HRI report calls on donors to stick to the current reform agenda, but warns that this might not be enough to deal with future challenges.</p> <p>\"Humanitarian needs and challenges will quickly outpace the ability of the current system to address them \u2013 even when it works at its very best,\" said Tamminga. \"What is needed is a new reform agenda, but refocusing less on aid delivery mechanics and more on how to anticipate, prevent, prepare for and mitigate future crises.\"</p> <p>Only 62 cents of every $100 spent on humanitarian aid programmes in 2005-09 went to disaster prevention and preparedness programmes, says the report. Overall, less than 1% of all official government aid \u2013 both development and humanitarian \u2013 went to such programmes.</p> <p>The failure of donors and aid agencies to respond to crises before they develop into humanitarian emergencies came into sharp focus last year with the famine in Somalia. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/interactive/2012/feb/22/somalia-famine-aid-media-interactive\" title=\"\">recent Guardian analysis</a> found more than 70% of humanitarian aid for Somalia and almost 90% of mainstream US and UK media coverage came after the formal UN declaration of famine on 20 July 2011. This year, Oxfam and Save the Children said tens of thousands of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/east-africa-drought-disaster-report\" title=\"\">deaths could have been avoided</a> if the international community had responded earlier to clear warning signs of an escalating crisis in the region.</p> <p>Australia and Germany are among the few donors engaging with disaster risk reduction efforts, according to the HRI. The UK ranked among the top 10 donors. Its new <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2011/saving-lives-building-resilience-and-preventing-suffering/\" title=\"\">humanitarian aid policy</a> is also an \"enormously positive step\", said Tamminga. The new policy aims to improve the UK's response to \"slow onset\" crises and build disaster risk reduction plans into all its country programmes. The challenge, says Tamminga, will be translating this new policy into sustained and systematic changes in how assistance is delivered on the ground.</p> <p>In November 2011, a <a href=\"http://icai.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ICAI-Report-DFID-Climate-Change-Programme-in-Bangladesh-FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">largely positive evaluation</a> of UK funding for climate change resilience projects in Bangladesh said the programme failed to sufficiently hold its partners \u2013 the World Bank and the UN Development Programme \u2013 to account, and that delays and poor co-ordination meant only \u00a313m of the \u00a375m allocated had been spent.</p> <p>The HRI report warns that while more donors are referencing gender concerns in their humanitarian policies, these issues remain largely absent in project proposals and funding allocations, and few ever follow-up on whether they are actually addressed in the programmes they support. \"The message from donors seems to be that gender is an important political commitment, but not a practical priority in humanitarian crises,\" says the report.</p> <p>Last week, the US Agency for International Development (USAid) said it would work to address the unique challenges facing women in crisis and conflict-affected environments, as part of its <a href=\"http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/policy_planning_and_learning/documents/GenderEqualityPolicy.pdf\" title=\"\">new gender policy</a>.

      "bodyText": "For the beautiful young women at the court of \"the merry monarch\" Charles II, trying to live on their wits and their looks was a dangerous gamble. At least two of the subjects of a new exhibition at Hampton Court Palace died so young, and so unexpectedly, that contemporary gossip insisted they were poisoned by jealous husbands. The exhibition, the first at Hampton Court on the Stuart period after a decade spent on the Tudors and Henry VIII, is in the Queen's state apartments, which were created in the late 17th century by Sir Christopher Wren for Mary II. \"Beauty was a very thin line,\" the show's curator, Brett Dolman, said. \"On one side, beauty is taken as a symbol of virtue and perfection, beauty could allow you to rise far beyond your original station in life. On the other, beauty is viewed with suspicion as a snare and one wrong step and your reputation is destroyed forever.\" The portrait of Elizabeth Butler, by the 17th-century artist Peter Lely, usually hangs at Chevening in Kent, the mansion once owned by her husband, Philip Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield, and now shared by the foreign secretary, William Hague, and the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg. Butler attracted the roving eye of the king's brother, James, was sent away from court by Stanhope \u2013 despite his own rackety reputation \u2013 and was dead within the year. Margaret Brooke, one of two beautiful sisters, was also targeted by James but married a much older poet, John Denham: she too was sent from court and was dead within a year, aged 20. On the other hand Frances Stuart, painted by Lely as Diana the hunter, and dubbed \"the prettiest girl in the world\" by the diarist Samuel Pepys, just about kept clear of the king's grasping hands, married well and became the model for Britannia on the coinage. The most famously avaricious for both money and power, and the mistress who retained power over the king for longest, was Barbara Villiers: the exhibition includes the outrageous portrait of her as the Virgin Mary, dandling her son by the king, both perfectly recognisable to her contemporaries. Nell Gwynn will sprawl naked at the heart of the exhibition, her past as an actor and Covent Garden orange seller forgotten, her two sons by the king on their way to becoming nobility \u2013 even if legend says she dangled one out of a window and threatened to let go to win him a title. The portrait the king is said to have displayed at the head of his bed, concealed behind a blameless landscape, is coming on loan from a private collector \u2013 it was auctioned at Christie's in 2007 for \u00a31.7m. She was loved as much for her wit as her beauty: when a crowd stopped her carriage, believing it held Louise de Keroualle, suspected of being a Catholic French spy, Gwynn retorted: \"Pray good people be civil, I am the Protestant whore.\" She is also said to have handicapped a rival for the king, Moll Davis, by lacing her food with a purgative. Many of the portraits come from two famous series in the royal collection, The Windsor Beauties and the Hampton Court Beauties \u2013 but Dolman says visitors have in the past walked past them like wallpaper. \"Part of the problem is their baroque style which, apart from the period when it was the height of fashion, has tended to be viewed with suspicion: not English enough, too racy, too French.\" Many of the beauties have spent years in store, including the wildest \u2013 by repute \u2013 of them all, Hortense Mancini, niece of the French Cardinal Jules Mazarin. The painting shows her sister reading her palm and prophesying she will fall in love with a king: by the time she reached the court in 1676, on the run from an older husband so mad he forbade his female servants to milk cows lest it give them sexual kicks, gossip said she had slept with many men, at least one priest, several nuns and the king's illegitimate daughter \u2013 with whom she fought a public fencing match with both women in nightgowns. \"I don't know how many of the stories can possibly be true,\" Dolman said. \"I can't see how she would have had the time.\" The Wild, the Beautiful and the Damned, Hampton Court Palace, East Molesey, Surrey from 5 April to 30 September www.hrp.org.uk/HamptonCourtPalace/",

The word most commonly used by a culture to refer to itself is \"people\". But as the meanings of words change, folk came to be associated with the \"common people\". Currently, the use of \"folk\" is deeply enmeshed in American political discourse. It is a way for politicians to express affiliation with the American working and middle classes. In the US, the imagined middle class is conceived as the common people. In music, folk was initially used to describe traditional song and dance. The originator of the work was unknown and therefore it became the property of the folk, along with stories and other forms of intellectual property. This \"folk thing\" hardly refers to traditional music, so it must concern a more recent trend. My first thought was Mumford and Sons, broadly described as a British folk band. Also, because one of my favourite questions was: \"If marooned at sea, which member of Mumford and Sons would you eat last?\" I asked some musician friends what they thought \"folk\" means. Lou Barlow said: \"Does he mean freak folk like Devendra Banhart? Or someone like James Yorkston?\" I speculated that modern folk meant having lots of interesting instruments and lots of members, but I was overruled because Arcade Fire have lots of interesting instruments and no one was willing to call them folk. The person who said \"it has a banjo\" was booed. I thought it could be useful to use SXSW to check the status of the \"folk thing\". As the festival could be considered a snapshot of emerging artists attempting to get a foothold in the industry, it is an apt location to consider the health of various musical styles. In applying to play a showcase, artists are given a set of genres they must choose from that includes folk, but does not include subgenres such as chillwave or sadcore. Other options are country and alt-country. Yet, there is only the category of rock, no alt-rock or indie. Perhaps because alt-rock/indie has become so ubiquitous it is the assumed association of rock. If so, you'd need to develop some retro nomenclature for the few rock bands culture pundits feel free to vilify such as Nickelback and Train. Maybe the genre of \"uncool rock\", although I'd be interested to see if anyone would dare use it. So here is a breakdown of the genres chosen by the 2,000 bands playing official showcases.

      "bodyText": "China upset the markets earlier in the week by cutting its growth forecasts for the year. But talk that the country might reduce import taxes on luxury goods has given a lift to Burberry. The company has climbed 44p to \u00a314.37 following a report in the China Daily that the country wanted to reduce the cost of bringing in a range of goods, from watches to handbags. The paper quoted Wei Jianguo, a member of the National Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as saying: Consumer and luxury goods will help promote domestic consumption and China needs to reduce import duties. China's luxury market is said to be worth some $30bn, and Burberry is one of a number of businesses to be busy expanding in the region. Its recent trading update showed a 39% jump in revenues from Asia Pacific, with store growth in China up 30%. Still with retail, J Sainsbury added 3.9p to 292.9p after M1, a vehicle for Lebanese brothers Taha and Najib Miktai, raised its stake to 3.02%. The two are believed to think the supermarket group is a valuable property play, given its land assets were valued at \u00a310.9bn at its last results in November, compared to its market capitalisation of around \u00a35.5bn. Home Retail, the Argos and Homebase owner, rose 1.6p to 103.2p despite Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon repeating his sell rating ahead of a fourth quarter update next week, and cutting his profit forecasts. He said: The new managing director of Argos held a series of interviews with the press last month, in which he said that he had been given a blank piece of paper. We think that he needs to start writing a list of store closures on it. While it may be true that Argos has few stores that don't make a contribution to overhead, this does not mean that this will perpetuate in an online world, with both Tesco and Amazon continuing to invest substantially. In the absence of an accelerated store closure programme, we are downgrading our forecasts again. We are assuming that like-for-like sales continue to fall in 2013 and 2014, which has negative implications for margins. We are therefore downgrading our pretax profit forecasts by 34% and by 45% for 2013 and 2014 respectively. This has implications for the dividend. We think that this year's final will now be passed. We think that Home Retail's valuation remains too high and does not take into account the potential costs of change, nor the possibility that it is too late. We remain sellers with a target price of 60p. Overall the markets have recovered some ground after Tuesday's declines, ahead of the deadline for the deal with Greece's private bondholders to be completed. After a fairly downbeat set of economic figures this week, came some better news on the US jobs front. The ADP private sector payroll jumped by 216,000 in February, just ahead of expectations. January's data was also revised slightly higher to 173,000 jobs. The main US jobs news comes on Friday with the non-farm payrolls. So the FTSE 100 finished 25.61 points higher at 5791.41, with German and French markets both higher, and Wall Street up nearly 80 points by the time London closed. Motor insurer Admiral was the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100, up 104p to \u00a311.44 after better than expected results. Essar Energy recovered 5.4p to 107p, but too late to save it being demoted from the leading index. Leading the way down was British American Tobacco, off 65.5p at \u00a331.26 as its shares went ex-dividend. Elsewhere National Grid dipped 3.5p to 645.5p after analysts at Berenberg Bank began coverage with a sell recommendation and 575p price target. They were cautious about the new regulatory review, as well as the prospects for the company's US business. And they believe the size of the company's proposed capital expenditure programme would put pressure on its balance sheet: National Grid will have to choose from a range of capital measures in our view, with a dividend cut also possible. Pearson added 4p to \u00a311.94, shaking off a sell note from Liberum Capital, which was based on what the broker believes is a growing problem for the company's US higher education business, which accounts for around a third of its profits. Analyst Ian Whittaker said states are increasingly turning to open source textbooks to help students - already struggling with high tuition fees - to save money. He said: As tuition fees in the California university system are raised again, lawmakers are turning to open source textbooks as a way of relieving the pressure on students. This highlights the risk of the cyclical (rising tuition fees driven by state budget cuts) exacerbating the structural (the pushing of cheaper alternatives to high-priced textbooks to students), which threatens Pearson's established business model. Our view is that high textbook pricing looks increasingly unsustainable with technology allowing new cheaper business models to emerge and financial pressures on students and states acting as the catalyst for change. Cobham was the best performer in the FTSE 250, up 23.4p to 209.7p after defence and commercial electronics group said 2011 profits rose 7% and it raised its full year dividend by a third. Punch Taverns put on 0.5p to 11.25p on talk of possible bid interest from private equity groups or even rival Mitchells &amp; Butlers. M&amp;B rose 3.3p to 256.6p after HSBC put an overweight rating on the shares with a 280p target, following a breakfast meeting with the company. HSBC said the corporate governance issues at the group were likely to subside as it hired a new chief executive and non-executive directors. Trading was likely to be helped by Easter, the Olympics and the Jubilee although margin pressure remained. Finally Matra Petroleum edged up 0.5% to 0.86p despite market speculation of a \u00a310m fundraising at 0.5p a share, to help fund its next well.",

      "bodyText": "The refugees were all crammed into a school. They were Lebanese. The children slept on threadbare mattresses in classrooms. Generous locals were bringing in supplies. This was Homs in 2006 and the families had been fleeing the Israeli bombing in Lebanon. Homs was once again playing host to Lebanese refugees, as it had done during much of the 15-year Lebanese civil war. Fast forward to this January. I was surrounded by refugee children in an abandoned school but this time the roles were reversed. Lebanese were hosting people from Homs in the villages of Wadi Khaled, a mountainous region of north-east Lebanon. Since last April, hundreds have crossed the border, fleeing the Assad regime's oppression. By this month there were just over 7,000 UN-registered refugees in northern Lebanon, with thousands living unregistered in the hills and in Tripoli. As the Syrian regime \"cleansed\" Bab Amr in Homs, another 2,000 to 3,000 fled across the border, joined by others following the Syrian army's shelling of towns such as Al Qusayr near the border on 4 March. The refugees had to walk for days in freezing conditions, evading landmines and regime forces who shelled one bridge used to cross into Lebanon at Qusayr. They arrive traumatised by the horrors of what they left behind. Most families have lost loved ones and are terrified of going back. One refugee I met during my visit had had to be dragged injured by his friends across a minefield. Refugees from Tell Kalakh, close to the border, told me that their houses had either been taken over or destroyed since they left. The effects on children have, as ever, been the most dramatic. In a run-down apartment in Tripoli, Ahmed, a four-year-old boy from Homs, came up to me and said: \"All I can hear is the tanks firing outside my house.\" Historically, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan have all hosted refugee communities including Armenians, Palestinians and Iraqis. Lebanon was traditionally a haven for refugees from the region seeking the protection of its mountains \u2013 but no longer. Just ask the Palestinians who languish in appalling refugee camps. The current Lebanese government is friendly with Damascus and does all it can to discourage Syrian refugees. They are not even recognised as refugees. The Lebanese politically correct phrase is \"those fleeing the unrest\". The Lebanese president, Michel Suleiman, dismissed the issue last Thursday, saying: \"The influx of some Syrian families as a result of the turbulence in Syrian does not constitute a major problem because they can stay with their relatives.\" This echoes Reem Haddad, the Syrian regime's spokesperson, when she said about Syrians fleeing to Turkey: \"It's a bit like having a problem in your street, and your mum lives in the next street, so you go and visit your mum for a bit.\" The UN high commissioner for refugees has to operate quietly under the eye of Lebanese security. The Syrians cannot get jobs and are not allowed permits to travel around Lebanon. As yet, there is no question of establishing a refugee camp as in Turkey and Jordan. Many Syrians are critical of the UN, believing that they should do more. Many refugees are afraid to register, concerned that their details would be handed over to the Lebanese or Syrian security services. Many of the latest refugees entered Lebanon through the Beka'a valley where they were stopped and searched by the Lebanese army. Around 30 to 40 have been arrested, according to Syrian activists. All this creates additional tension as the Beka'a is predominantly Shia and under Hezbollah control, while the refugees are nearly all Sunni. Not all Lebanese are unwelcoming. The refugees in Wadi Khaled and Tripoli are largely housed by local families, even though the villages in this area are among the most deprived in Lebanon with high unemployment. The refugees I met shivered in unheated buildings, some without windows, but many of the latest arrivals are freezing inside tents. It may not get much warmer soon. A local saying warns: \"Keep your biggest coals for March.\" Support for the refugees is broadly divided on sectarian political grounds. Lebanese Sunnis have largely rallied round to lend support, including former Lebanese prime minister Sa'ad al-Hariri's Future Movement. On the other hand, the Maronite Christian patriarch has just declared that \"the closest thing to democracy (in the Arab world) is Syria\". All of this exposes Lebanon to additional tensions as a result of the Syria crisis. Its politics is polarised and inter-community tensions are on the increase. In February, three people were killed in clashes between Lebanese Alawis and Sunnis in Tripoli. All the major political players, perhaps even Hezbollah, are calculating very carefully how to position themselves if the Assad regime falls. Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon's Progressive Socialist party and powerful Druze community, has jumped the gun with his umpteenth U-turn, by announcing his opposition to the Syrian regime once again, while remaining part of the pro-Assad coalition. His solution, he told me, was for the west to find out how much they had to bribe the Russians. These refugees need and deserve our support. In Tripoli, doctors tell me that they cannot cope with the injured and require help now. The international community could do little to help the people of Homs throughout the shelling of Bab Amr, but they can at least ensure that survivors of that terrifying ordeal can live in dignity in Lebanon with their rights respected. So far, international governments have done precious little. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "The boss of car insurer Admiral invoked Charles Dickens when he unveiled better results than feared following a shock profit warning last year. The insurer's chief executive Henry Engelhardt quoted the novelist's famous opening sentence from A Tale of Two Cities: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness ...\" \"How did Mr Dickens know, nearly 200 years ago, that his words could be used to describe Admiral's 2011 year?\" Engelhardt asked. \"It has been a disappointing year. Not because it was a bad year, but because so much more was expected.\" The company, which insures more than one in 10 cars on Britain's roads, made a profit before tax of \u00a3299m last year, up 13% from 2010. This was better than the \u00a3289m pencilled in by City analysts. Analysts had initially forecast a 22% profit rise but were forced to slash their estimates in November when Admiral warned it had been hit by a surge in personal injury claims. Injury claims dropped in the second half of the year, in a sign that Britain's \"whiplash epidemic\" is easing, at least for the moment. Admiral shares closed up 10% at \u00a311.44. The UK's second-largest car insurer after RBSI (recently rebranded as Direct Line), with 2.9m customers, said a combination of mild winter weather, higher policy excesses, rising petrol prices and lower disposable incomes which discouraged people from driving had led to a 10% fall in claims across the industry. \"This helped slow the relentless rise in the cost of bodily injury claims in the UK market,\" said Admiral's chief operating officer David Stevens, as well as tempering insurers' appetite for price increases. He said the middle of the year marked the point when the dramatic premium inflation that kicked off in late 2009 ground to a halt. Admiral's premiums rose 12% last year, following a 16% increase in 2010. Car insurance premiums have been rising to cover mounting costs from the surge in whiplash claims in recent years. Bosses from the UK's biggest insurers, including Admiral, recently met David Cameron to discuss action against the whiplash epidemic. Over the last three years, the number of whiplash claims has jumped by 32% to 570,000 a year, even though the number of accidents reported has dropped by 16% to less than 210,000. Engelhardt finished his comments with another Dickens quote, this time from Oliver Twist. \"For the eighth consecutive year, in fact every year since we became a public company, Admiral has reported record turnover and record profits with a return on capital of 59%. If this is, as Dickens put it, the winter of despair, then I say: Please, Sir, may I have some more?\" Admiral is paying shareholders a total dividend of 75.6p for the year, up 11% from 2010. Its 5,500 staff will receive free shares worth \u00a33,000 each under the employee share scheme, the same as in 2010. Oriel Securities analyst Marcus Barnard said: \"We see a group which is sensibly slowing the growth rate and increasing premium rates, while tackling the emergence of bodily injury claims. This is much as we suggested they do in our September note.\" Wise words from the boardroom The Admiral boss is not the only one to wax lyrical in the annual results statement. Bloomsbury Publishing chairman Jeremy Wilson quoted Charles Darwin in the 2011 annual report: \"'It is not the strongest of the species, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.' Bloomsbury is undergoing one of the most significant periods of adaptation in its 25-year history.\" Others are more into popular culture. Having unveiled a \u00a3237m loss in mid-2008, Brixton Estates boss Tim Wheeler felt the urge to provide his own cover version of Bob Dylan's All Along the Watchtower. The property firm's quarterly results quoted the lyrics: \"There must be some way out of here / Said the joker to the thief / There's too much confusion / I can't get no relief.\" Wheeler explained the jokers and thieves referred to \"opportunist buyers\" and \"owners who won't sell\". And \"I can't get no relief\" translated into \"the imposition of empty rates which imposed a further financial burden on commercial property\". Another classic is this quote from veteran investor Warren Buffett: \"You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out\" - his 2001 warning that the good times would not last forever. Robert Hiscox, who will bow out as chairman of the eponymous UK insurer next year, always rambled about being tested by \"Mother Nature\" and did not mince his words when he spotted signs of \"foolish underwriting\". But when it comes to chairman ramblings, Andrew Perloff, of UK property investment firm Panther Securities, is hard to beat. Luckily he provided some kind of explanation to those struggling to follow his thoughts: \"As always, my ramblings are little convoluted and it may be hard for readers to understand the connection between my thoughts on BP PLC, the bankers, George Best and our Afghan tenant, of course I will explain. In every case the wrong person/people have been attacked.\"",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners fear increases in peak fares could force commuters off trains while unions warn local stations may close if the government endorses plans to cut costs by changing the way the industry is run. The transport secretary, Justine Greening, will set the direction of travel for the railways on Thursday with her official response to the McNulty review of the industry. She will also announce a new look at rail fares and a consultation on devolving powers over the network to local authorities. The report by Sir Roy McNulty last year concluded that rail operating costs in Britain were 20%-30% higher than they should be and identified automatic ticketing and cutting staff on trains as potential savings. The government is expected broadly to endorse the proposals, which include sacrificing some ticket offices. Unions believe this could lead to station closures, job losses and higher fares. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA union, said: \"If the local booking office goes, then the station will not be far behind. This will amount to a mini-Beeching with hundreds of stations in rural areas facing the threat of long-termclosure.\" The Campaign for Better Transport has sounded alarm over fares, given McNulty's recommendation that the system should better manage peak demand by charging more for the busiest trains. Passengers already face fare rises 3% above inflation next year. Chief executive Stephen Joseph warned that many commuters have inflexible work times or commitments like childcare or school runs. Research suggested higher fares would have only a marginal impact on when people travelled. He said: \"If people could change their commute times easily, they would have done so by now to avoid having to stand on crowded trains. Raising the prices will simply create political opposition, price people on lower incomes off trains and make little difference to overcrowding.\" Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said: \"Plans to give train companies even greater freedoms to hike rail fares, close ticket offices and provide fewer staff on trains and at stations show just how out of touch ministers are with passengers and commuters. Labour also warned against the government hastening the \"deep alliances\" that Network Rail has announced with train operators in the wake of McNulty in an attempt to work more closely together and drive down costs. Network Rail says the alliances, where train and track management will share regional offices, will \"better align incentives and see quicker, more joined-up, decision making\". However, the RMT union says the plans mean \"mini-Railtracks\" and critics believe operators will in effect take control. Eagle said: \"The same private companies who are already raking in large profits in an industry that receives \u00a34bn of taxpayers' money every year are for the first time set to be given the whip hand over infrastructure as well as services.\" The third strand of the government's rail reform package will be a consultation on devolving power over local railways to regional transport bodies \u2014 potentially opening up more of the country to the kind of integrated ticketing and services delivered in the capital by Transport for London now. There was better news for part-time workers or parents working flexible hours. The government is indicating that it wants to see part-time commuter season tickets, offering discounts for regular passengers on the same journey who may not keep daily hours. In addition, Oyster-style smart ticketing is likely to be demanded from operators on future franchises. Rail minister Theresa Villiers said the technology offered the \"potential for more flexible season tickets better suited to modern working practices\".",

      "bodyText": "An enormous spider has just taken up residence in the back garden of a house in Hampstead, north London. The eight-legged beast, which arrived in a huge crate before being assembled on the back lawn this week, is one of Louise Bourgeois's spider sculptures and the most eye-catching piece in an extraordinary exhibition of the late artist's work at the Freud Museum. Another spider sculpture by Bourgeois was the first piece of art to go on show in the Turbine Hall when Tate Modern opened in 2000. The Freud Museum's spider, made in 1994, is smaller but still an imposing sight, especially in its new garden setting. \"The trees will come into bloom over it,\" said Philip Larratt-Smith, the show's curator and Bourgeois's literary archivist. \"Louise liked it when the spiders had a bit of cover and they're a little claustrophobic. I think it'll look very nice here.\" Carol Seigel, the museum's director, said precautions had been taken to avoid the sculpture being stolen by scrap metal thieves, after a Barbara Hepworth sculpture was taken from Dulwich Park in December. \"It's embedded in the ground \u2013 it would be quite hard to remove it and there is security around the house.\" Titled Louise Bourgeois: The Return of the Repressed, the exhibition was inspired by the discovery of a cache of the artist's writing, which revealed that she had undergone psychoanalysis, a fact she had previously kept secret. \"She went from making these tall, monolithic statues in the early 50s, then re-emerged with a totally new body of work in the 60s,\" said Larratt-Smith. \"It was always a mystery how she got from A to B. These writings fill in the story.\" Bourgeois died in 2010 aged 98. She had given Larratt-Smith permission to put the psychoanalytic writings, including notes, lists, drawings and jottings, on public display. They are now on show, alongside her sculptures \u2013 including The Dangerous Obsession, pictured \u2013 in the house to which the father of psychoanalysis escaped in 1938 after the Nazis invaded Austria. Bourgeois's favourite sculpture, Janus Fleuri (1968), hangs suspended above Freud's famous couch. It resembles both male and female genitals and is, said Larratt-Smith, a \"very dense and compacted symbol, like you'd find in Freudian dream analysis\". Although she was ambivalent about psychoanalysis and its effects on her as an artist, Bourgeois was, said Seigler, \"steeped in Freud\" and the writings of other psychoanalysts, and her work is vividly influenced by their themes. With this influence in mind, the Louise Bourgeois foundation approached the museum with the offer to stage the exhibition, which had previously travelled around South America. The museum has shown the work of other artists influenced by Freud including Susan Hiller, Sophie Calle and Mat Collishaw. Seigel said the exhibition would show \"how psychoanalysis has impacted so strongly on both Bourgeois and more broadly on 20th and 21st century thinking\". As one of the major artists of the last century, Bourgeois's work is more commonly seen in large galleries and museums, and to set it in an intimate domestic setting was a particular challenge to the Freud Museum, which receives no public funding. Discussing a dream that requires no analysis, Seigel said she had \"a nightmare that the sculptures upstairs would crash through the floor, destroying not only it but Freud's desk underneath\". A structural engineer assured her that the museum's floors were strong enough to support two of Bourgeois's disturbing cell sculptures. The museum hopes to attract large numbers to the show but cannot accommodate more than 200 visitors a day. \"It's a tremendous privilege that we have this major artist in the Freud museum after planning it for nine months,\" said Seigel. \"I can't quite believe that it's happened.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government is said to be considering cutting tax relief on pension contributions for the highest earners in the 2012 budget instead of introducing a mansion tax. What does this mean, what difference could it make and who does it affect? What is pension tax relief? Every pound you pay into a private pension scheme is matched with tax relief by the government \u2013 effectively any income tax you have paid on that pound is paid into your pension fund. This means that for every \u00a380 a basic rate tax payer puts into a pension scheme, the government pays \u00a320. Even those who don't pay tax but are still contributing to a pension (maybe because their partner is providing the money) can still receive tax relief at 20% on contributions up to \u00a32,880 a year: the government tops this amount up to a total of \u00a33,600. If you are a higher rate tax payer, you can claim additional tax relief through your self assessment return. The relief ranges from 1% to 20% more, depending on how much you earn above the higher rate tax band and how much you contribute to your pension. If some of your contribution comes from earnings that have been taxed at 40%, then you will get 40% tax relief, But if some comes from the 20% tax band, you will get the lower rate of relief on that part. Likewise, the highest rate taxpayers who pay 50% income tax on the top slice of their earnings \u2013 anything over \u00a3150,000 \u2013 can benefit from between 1% and 30% additional tax relief. You can put 100% of your annual earnings in a pension if you can afford it, and will receive tax relief on up to \u00a350,000 of contributions in the current tax year, meaning someone earning \u00a3200,000 would receive \u00a325,000 from the government towards their pension. What is the purpose of tax relief? The aim of tax relief is to encourage people to invest more towards their retirement and rely less on the state for income after they stop working. Those who receive below a certain threshold in pension income \u2013 currently \u00a3137.35 if you are single or \u00a3209.70 if you have a partner \u2013 receive a top up through a means-tested benefit called pension credit. The more people that save for themselves, the fewer who will need to claim pension credit. Why change things? The amount of tax relief paid by the government has nearly doubled in the last decade, from \u00a317.6bn in 2001-02 to \u00a332.9bn in 2010-11. In the last few years the proportion paid to higher-rate taxpayers has also increased because the government has frozen the tax band thresholds, thereby driving up the number of higher rate tax payers. Ten years ago there were 3 million higher rate tax payers \u2013 10.5% of the 28.6 million taxpayers, according to David Heaton, employee benefits partner at accountants Baker Tilly. Now there are more than 4 million people \u2013 13.3% of the 29.9 million taxpayers in the 40% and 50% bands, and this figure will rise again in April when the 40% threshold is frozen again at \u00a342,475. In 2009-10, 18% of the pension tax relief went to those earning \u00a3150,000 or more, while a further 16% went to those earning \u00a375,000 to \u00a3149,999. None of these people should need to draw on state benefits in retirement, so there is less need to \"bribe\" them with such generous tax relief. The government is also reported to be looking for savings so that it can abolish the 50% rate of tax. So what is being considered for the budget, according to the rumours? Speculation surrounds cutting of the tax relief received by those earning \u00a3150,000 or more: the most commonly mooted idea is a reduction in the level of relief such investors get to 20%. However the Centre for Policy Studies will recommend in a report published on 9 March that higher rate tax relief should be abolished altogether. Some \u00a33bn of the \u00a37bn saved through this measure could be used to re-instate the 10p dividend tax credit abolished by Gordon Brown in his first budget in 1997. The thinktank also suggests removing the option of taking out 25% of your pension fund as a tax free lump; instead investors would get a 5% top up to their pension pot just before they use the money to buy an annuity. That would be of much more lasting benefit to all pension investors \u2013 not just the extremely wealthy ones \u2013 and the thinktank says it would be cost neutral. Would this work? Not according to pensions expert Tom McPhail of independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown. He says that if the higher rate of tax relief is abolished, investors will simply opt for \"salary sacrifice\" instead. This is where you ask your employer to pay money into your pension instead of receiving a higher salary. The payments would be gross \u2013 with no tax payable \u2013 and therefore equivalent to their marginal rate of tax. He also says that continual tinkering with pension rules by successive governments could deter people from investing in pensions. He points to evidence from New Zealand where investors opted out of the government sponsored scheme Kiwisaver, citing two system changes in five years as a reason not to trust the savings scheme or the government in the long run. \"Governments meddle at their peril,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Wissot: 'the battle this fall lies in wooing the working class' The anticipation of Super Tuesday often correlates to voters seeking closure during a primary. Even without clinching the nomination, it decisively serves as a harbinger of things to come. Barack Obama surprisingly picked up more delegates than Hillary Clinton on Super Tuesday in 2008, leading to his eventual nomination. But in that instance, there were 23 states in contention, including New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California. With only ten states up for grabs last night, Super Tuesday was far less eventful. The state with the highest delegate count actually went to Newt Gingrich, which could be his last major victory. But the final delegate tally did fortify a sense of where this primary is heading. At this point, it is purely a numbers game for Mitt Romney. With over 400 delegates, more than the other three candidates combined, he is amassing the necessary support to become the Republican nominee. Romney's victory in Ohio may have been the headline. But the real story lies in Gingrich winning Georgia and Rick Santorum picking up Oklahoma, Tennessee and North Dakota. Now, every candidate can justify why they should stay in the race, which will lead to more Romney pluralities as Gingrich and Santorum split the conservative vote. The influence of the South has been overstated. After Alabama and Mississippi next Tuesday, the remaining Southern states are spread evenly through May. So, the idea that Gingrich or Santorum can rely on a regional strategy is somewhat folly. Simply put, in a three-way race, Romney is the only candidate who can mathematically prevail. Looking at Ohio more closely, the age and education demographics stand out. Romney widened his support among seniors, beating Santorum 47% to 31%. Even though seniors lean conservative, they care about electability, as well as steadiness over flash. Romney's large family also explains his unique connection with seniors, whose most prized possessions are their children and grandchildren. Among college graduates \u2013 nearly half of those who voted in Ohio \u2013 Romney beat Santorum 43% to 35%. Interestingly enough, higher education and higher income were two voter blocs that sided strongly for Obama in the last general election. These similarities essentially guarantee that the real battle this fall lies in wooing the working class. As Romney inches closer to the nomination and prepares for a showdown with President Obama, he needs to do more with those working-class voters than simply offer solutions. This election hinges on whether Romney can show he understands the daily challenges that voters face to make ends meet. For all of Romney's accomplishments, defeating Barack Obama would be the most impressive one yet. Michael Wissot is a senior strategist for Luntz Global Matt Lewis: 'No coup de grace from Romney, but he made progress' The morning after Super Tuesday, the narrative is still in flux. The pundits \u2013 often derided as \"inside the bubble\" \u2013 typically settle on a common narrative. Yet, the Super Tuesday story line is still muddied. One one side of the argument are those who say that, despite winning the majority of Super Tuesday states (and most of the delegates), Mitt Romney has nothing to be proud of. After all, Ron Paul \u2013 Ron Paul! \u2013 garnered 41% of the vote in Virginia (only Romney and Paul were on the ballot in the Old Dominion). And Romney barely squeaked out a narrow victory against Rick Santorum \u2013 Rick Santorum! \u2013 in the crucial swing-state of Ohio. This, they say, is nothing to write home about. This is chaos. On the other side of the argument are those who argue that, well, a win is a win. The Drudge Report, for example, featured a picture of Romney holding a torch, accompanied by the words, \"FINALLY\" on the popular website Wednesday morning. The message is clear: Romney had finally done it and become the presumptive nominee. This is a bit much. After Super Tuesday, it seems clear that none of Romney's opponents are really catching fire. By the same token, Romney isn't exactly inspiring confidence in Republicans hoping to defeat Barack Obama in the fall. Romney failed to deliver a coup de grace, but he did make progress. Tuesday night's victories will likely mean that more Republican leaders and voters will slowly, grudgingly, begin coalescing around Romney. It's not exciting or inspiring. He might still arrive at the Republican convention without the required 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination. But Mitt Romney is slouching toward Tampa. Matt Lewis is senior contributor to the Daily Caller Cheri Jacobus: 'Romney prevailed, but it was too close for comfort' After a long and laborious Republican primary filled with dramatic ups and downs, interspersed with nap-inducing boring stretches, Super Tuesday failed to settle the race. Despite a solid win for Mitt Romney, the early evening narrative was that he had a milquetoast showing. \"Inevitability\" was a word used in conjunction with \"Mitt Romney\" early in the process, but as time has gone on, that has become less so \u2013 as we saw the rise of almost literally every other GOP contender in the race. Neither Newt Gingrich nor Rick Santorum managed to get on Virginia's ballot yesterday, a key state that President Obama won in 2008. It was Romney's by default, without him needing to so much as break a sweat. He also captured his home state of Massachusetts and Vermont, both considered low-hanging fruit, along with Alaska and Idaho. Gingrich won his home state of Georgia, but had to actually work for it. Nor did he sweep the south, as Santorum scored a big win in Tennessee. Oklahoma and North Dakota in the Santorum column further faded the Romney \"inevitability\" tag. The biggest prize of Tuesday, however, was Ohio, the jewel of the Super Tuesday. Santorum's organizational snags cost him delegates and nearly two-thirds of the delegates belong to Romney, who still needed to win the popular vote decisively. He prevailed, but it was too close for comfort. Americans love competition. We are accustomed to a stark line between winning and losing. But the new GOP \"proportional allocation\" of delegates based on a candidate's votes accrued by congressional districts or overall percentage of state-wide vote muddies the waters and fosters a high degree of ambiguity. Interestingly, Romney won among Ohio Republicans, but Democrats voted for Santorum, intent on skewing the outcome, just as they attempted in Michigan. Cheri Jacobus is a political strategist, pundit and writer James Antle: 'Any reasonably competent Republican will perform well one-on-one against Romney' Mitt Romney can't win, even when he does. The headline on CNN's website in the wee hours of the morning after Super Tuesday was: \"No knockout blow for Romney.\" And it's true: Romney lost four states, finishing a fairly distant second in two primaries and running third in a caucus. All three of his opponents retain pockets of strength that have proved resistant to the presumptive frontrunner's appeal. Bob Dole did much better in 1996, sweeping every state that voted on Super Tuesday, and George W Bush somewhat so in 2000. Even in the most important state Romney managed to win, Ohio, it was painfully close. He edged out the massively outspent and overmatched Rick Santorum by roughly a single percentage point. Dubya, by contrast, won Ohio by 21 points in 2000. Pathetic! Yet, some perspective is in order. Romney won six out of ten states. John McCain won just nine out of 21 on Super Tuesday in 2008, losing 12 to Romney and Mike Huckabee combined. McCain was almost universally proclaimed the inevitable frontrunner after his showing. Why not Romney? Because of delegates, comes the reply. That's what really matters, and McCain's wins came in winner-take-all states. But Romney swept the delegates from Massachusetts, won all but three of the delegates from Virginia, has a much larger lead among Ohio's delegates than in the raw popular vote, and took delegates even from every single state he lost. Romney easily has more than twice as many delegates as Santorum, and a 1.2m popular vote lead to boot. Everybody has their reasons to stay in the race. Santorum did well with limited resources. Newt Gingrich won Georgia. Virginia reminded Ron Paul of the bounty he could reap if he is just patient enough to wait for the party establishment to finally shuffle Santorum and Gingrich out of the race. Any reasonably competent Republican will perform well one-on-one against Romney. But pundits must eventually come to terms with the following: yes, Romney is a weak frontrunner, but he is the frontrunner nevertheless. Romney doesn't need to overwhelm and dismember his opponents. He just needs to beat them often enough to secure the delegates required to win the nomination. So far, that's exactly what he's doing. James Antle is associate editor of the American Spectator Grover Norquist: 'Gingrich is just one unforced error by Santorum away from re-establishing himself as the credible challenger' Mitt Romney won the key contest for Ohio \u2013 narrowly \u2013 coming back from a double-digit deficit a few weeks ago. As in Michigan, Romney won, but not decisively. Santorum did well enough in carrying Tennessee and Oklahoma to claim the right to continue. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich carried Georgia and will stay in, thanks to strong financing from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson \u2013 and the knowledge that this race is unpredictable enough that he is one unforced error by Santorum away from re-establishing himself as the credible challenger to Romney. Romney is probably closer to winning the nomination, but the finish line has been moved farther into the future as we start counting delegates, not just primary victories. Ron Paul stays in the race to build his movement inside a party. Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform Tim Montgomerie: 'Romney must hope Gingrich stays in the race' Yet again, Mitt Romney takes faltering steps towards his inevitable victory in the race for the Republican nomination, but the steps are smaller than he'd like. Rick Santorum came perilously close to winning Ohio and proving that he has the best credentials to reach blue-collar America. Even without Ohio, Santorum's victories in Tennessee and Oklahoma proved what we've always known: Romney is not the darling of Republican heartlands. But does this matter? Romney may not be doing enough to win the GOP nomination easily, but he's not pandering to the GOP base, either. His journey through the nomination process is long, but he's not acquiring too much baggage that will harm him in the general election match up with Obama. Romney must hope that Gingrich will stay in the race. The last thing he needs is for all anti-Romney voters to unite behind Santorum. Gingrich won Sarah Palin's vote in Alaska and took his home state of Georgia easily. These two boosts will probably encourage him to fight on \u2013 but they could also be an argument for him to quit the race with his head held high. That Gingrich head is so big, however, that he's likely to choose to fight on. So long as that remains true, Romney has the only credible path to Tampa and victory in this marathon.

Even without clinching the nomination, it decisively serves as a harbinger of things to come. </p> <p>Barack Obama surprisingly picked up more delegates than Hillary Clinton on Super Tuesday in 2008, leading to his eventual nomination. But in that instance, there were 23 states in contention, including New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California. </p> <p>With only ten states up for grabs last night, Super Tuesday was far less eventful. The state with the highest delegate count actually went to Newt Gingrich, which could be his last major victory. But the final delegate tally did fortify a sense of where this primary is heading. At this point, it is purely a numbers game for Mitt Romney. With over 400 delegates, more than the other three candidates combined, he is amassing the necessary support to become the Republican nominee.</p> <p>Romney's victory in Ohio may have been the headline. But the real story lies in Gingrich winning Georgia and Rick Santorum picking up Oklahoma, Tennessee and North Dakota. Now, every candidate can justify why they should stay in the race, which will lead to more Romney pluralities as Gingrich and Santorum split the conservative vote.</p> <p>The influence of the South has been overstated. After Alabama and Mississippi next Tuesday, the remaining Southern states are spread evenly through May. So, the idea that Gingrich or Santorum can rely on a regional strategy is somewhat folly. Simply put, in a three-way race, Romney is the only candidate who can mathematically prevail.</p> <p>Looking at Ohio more closely, the age and education demographics stand out. Romney widened his support among seniors, beating Santorum 47% to 31%. Even though seniors lean conservative, they care about electability, as well as steadiness over flash. Romney's large family also explains his unique connection with seniors, whose most prized possessions are their children and grandchildren.</p> <p>Among college graduates \u2013 nearly half of those who voted in Ohio \u2013 Romney beat Santorum 43% to 35%. Interestingly enough, higher education and higher income were two voter blocs that sided strongly for Obama in the last general election. These similarities essentially guarantee that the real battle this fall lies in wooing the working class.</p> <p>As Romney inches closer to the nomination and prepares for a showdown with President Obama, he needs to do more with those working-class voters than simply offer solutions. This election hinges on whether Romney can show he understands the daily challenges that voters face to make ends meet.</p> <p>For all of Romney's accomplishments, defeating Barack Obama would be the most impressive one yet.</p> <p><em>Michael Wissot is a senior strategist for <a href=\"http://www.luntzglobal.com/\">Luntz Global</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-lewis\">Matt Lewis</a>: 'No coup de grace from Romney, but he made progress'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387039645\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/4/7/1302195821539/mattlewis_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Lewis\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The morning after Super Tuesday, the narrative is still in flux. The pundits \u2013 often derided as \"inside the bubble\" \u2013 typically settle on a common narrative. Yet, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/07/super-tuesday-romney-ohio-santorum\">the Super Tuesday story line is still muddied</a>.</p> <p>One one side of the argument are those who say that, despite winning the majority of Super Tuesday states (and most of the delegates), Mitt Romney has nothing to be proud of. After all, Ron Paul \u2013 Ron Paul! \u2013 garnered 41% of the vote in Virginia (only Romney and Paul were on the ballot in the Old Dominion). And Romney barely squeaked out a narrow victory against Rick Santorum \u2013 Rick Santorum! \u2013 in the crucial swing-state of Ohio.</p> <p>This, they say, is nothing to write home about. This is chaos.</p> <p>On the other side of the argument are those who argue that, well, a win is a win. <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/\">The Drudge Report, for example, featured</a> a picture of Romney holding a torch, accompanied by the words, \"FINALLY\" on the popular website Wednesday morning. The message is clear: Romney had finally done it and become the presumptive nominee.</p> <p>This is a bit much.</p> <p>After Super Tuesday, it seems clear that none of Romney's opponents are really catching fire. By the same token, Romney isn't exactly inspiring confidence in Republicans hoping to defeat Barack Obama in the fall. Romney failed to deliver a coup de grace, but he did make progress. Tuesday night's victories will likely mean that more Republican leaders and voters will slowly, grudgingly, begin coalescing around Romney. It's not exciting or inspiring.</p> <p>He might still arrive at the Republican convention without the required 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination. But Mitt Romney is slouching toward Tampa.</p> <p><em>Matt Lewis is senior contributor to the <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/\">Daily Caller</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Romney prevailed, but it was too close for comfort'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387039646\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After a long and laborious Republican primary filled with dramatic ups and downs, interspersed with nap-inducing boring stretches, Super Tuesday failed to settle the race. Despite a solid win for Mitt Romney, the early evening narrative was that he had a milquetoast showing. \"Inevitability\" was a word used in conjunction with \"Mitt Romney\" early in the process, but as time has gone on, that has become less so \u2013 as we saw the rise of almost literally every other GOP contender in the race. </p> <p>Neither Newt Gingrich nor Rick Santorum managed to get on Virginia's ballot yesterday, a key state that President Obama won in 2008. It was Romney's by default, without him needing to so much as break a sweat. He also captured his home state of Massachusetts and Vermont, both considered low-hanging fruit, along with Alaska and Idaho. Gingrich won his home state of Georgia, but had to actually work for it. Nor did he sweep the south, as Santorum scored a big win in Tennessee.</p> <p>Oklahoma and North Dakota in the Santorum column further faded the Romney \"inevitability\" tag. The biggest prize of Tuesday, however, was Ohio, the jewel of the Super Tuesday. Santorum's organizational snags cost him delegates and nearly two-thirds of the delegates belong to Romney, who still needed to win the popular vote decisively. He prevailed, but it was too close for comfort.</p> <p>Americans love competition. We are accustomed to a stark line between winning and losing. But the new GOP \"proportional allocation\" of delegates based on a candidate's votes accrued by congressional districts or overall percentage of state-wide vote muddies the waters and fosters a high degree of ambiguity. Interestingly, Romney won among Ohio Republicans, but Democrats voted for Santorum, intent on skewing the outcome, just as they attempted in Michigan.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a <a href=\"http://www.capitolstrategiespr.com/cherijacobus.html\">political strategist</a>, pundit and writer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Any reasonably competent Republican will perform well one-on-one against Romney'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387039647\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mitt Romney can't win, even when he does.</p> <p>The headline on CNN's website in the wee hours of the morning after Super Tuesday was: \"No knockout blow for Romney.\" And it's true: Romney lost four states, finishing a fairly distant second in two primaries and running third in a caucus. All three of his opponents retain pockets of strength that have proved resistant to the presumptive frontrunner's appeal. Bob Dole did much better in 1996, sweeping every state that voted on Super Tuesday, and George W Bush somewhat so in 2000. </p> <p>Even in the most important state Romney managed to win, Ohio, it was painfully close. He edged out the massively outspent and overmatched Rick Santorum by roughly a single percentage point. Dubya, by contrast, won Ohio by 21 points in 2000. Pathetic!</p> <p>Yet, some perspective is in order. Romney won six out of ten states. John McCain won just nine out of 21 on Super Tuesday in 2008, losing 12 to Romney and Mike Huckabee combined. McCain was almost universally proclaimed the inevitable frontrunner after his showing. Why not Romney?</p> <p>Because of delegates, comes the reply.

      "bodyText": "Pasta is the ultimate store-cupboard staple \u2013 a dash of olive oil, some parmesan, a few finely chopped anchovies and you have a delicious dinner. We make our pasta from scratch in my restaurants but I don't have time to make it at home, so I go for brands such as De Cecco or Barilla, whose pasta is bronze-extruded (which improves the texture). Pasta comes in hundreds of different forms, but does it really matter which sauce is paired with which shape? It is mostly a matter of personal preference, but here is my advice on how to get the best out of some common \u2013 and a few less familiar \u2013 pasta shapes. Spaghetti Always drain the pasta around 20 seconds before the end of the cooking time, because it continues to cook as it cools. Serve it with a hot sauce \u2013 clams, or garlic with chilli are both perfect. The one thing I would never serve with spaghetti is bolognese: I just don't think they go together. Spaghetti works better with olive oil-based sauces that coat it rather than drown it. Linguine This is flatter than spaghetti, so absorbs more of the juice, and, like spaghetti, goes best with oil-based accompaniments. I also love it with prawns, fresh tomatoes and chilli. Fettuccine I have seen good dry fettuccine on sale in both Waitrose and Carluccio's, but it is much better fresh. Just cook for a minute or two, until it rises to the surface. It is best with bolognese \u2013 or, as the Italians call it, rag\u00fa. I also like mine with a creamy sauce: reduce your cream, then add some cooked ham and peas. Ditalini These tiny pasta shapes are a real favourite of mine. When I am feeling rough, I find that nothing helps quite as much as a handful of ditalini cooked with a stock cube for an easy, warming broth. Farfalle This goes well with anything chunky. I usually serve it with vegetables such as peas, broad beans and mint; saut\u00e9ed aubergine, tomato and a pinch of cumin; or roasted courgettes, garlic and a dash of cream. Rigatoni I have always thought of rigatoni as manly, for some reason. I'd put it with a good, thick, meaty sauce. Penne This classic shape is great with a tomato-based sauce, a meat sauce, or pesto. Orecchiette This originates from southern Italy, where pasta is cooked without egg (using just olive oil, wheatflour and water), which makes it whiter. It is delicious served with tender-stem broccoli, garlic and some grated, dried ricotta, or in a cold pasta salad. Make sure you season your pasta salad with vinaigrette while it is still hot: if you do it when it is cold, it won't absorb as much flavour.",

      "bodyText": "EVERY LOSER \u2026 LOSES Considering the industrial Dot Cotton-esque levels of smoke sent billowing up Arsenal's nether regions by assorted fans and media commentators in the wake of last night's 3-0 Big Cup win against Milan, a simple tea-timely email could be forgiven for thinking they had actually won the tie and advanced to the quarter-finals. But wade through enough of the warm gloopy praise being lavished upon the Gunners for long enough and you'll eventually trip over the only stat that matters: when push came to shove they weren't able to finish the job and were dumped out 4-3 on aggregate. Yes, they did better than most expected last night, but if they hadn't played so abysmally in the San Siro they wouldn't have had a four-goal deficit to overhaul in the first place. And yes \u2026 they probably could have put Milan to the sword if they'd had a stronger bench, but then Arsenal's lack of strength in depth has been a source of frustration for so long, it's no surprise it proved their undoing again. But amidst all the happy-clappy talk of \"restoring pride\" in a match they might as well have lost 35-0 as won 3-0 for all the good it did them, deep down Arsenal fans must know last night's laudable but ultimately futile bottle-job has left them with far more questions than answers. Questions like \u2026 \u2022 Why can't our under-achieving players play like that more often? \u2022 How much will we get for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain when Manchester City buy him? \u2022 Where will that money go? \u2022 How much will we get for Robin van Persie when Manchester City buy him? \u2022 Where will that money go? But for the time being at least, such questions are likely to go unasked by the kind of people whose grasp of logic dictates they boo their team off after pre-season friendlies they've drawn, only to cheer them to the rafters for exiting the biggest competition in club football a wee bit less limply than expected. By Monday night when Arsenal's shattered players take on Newcastle, some Gooners will be so confused about what to do next they'll probably turn up to watch the match at White Hart Lane. But while their team might be out of the tournament, its manager has unfinished business, with Arsene Wenger charged by Uefa for post-match effing and jeffing at the officials. \"I was not happy with the referee because he gave them many free-kicks in the centre of the park,\" said Wenger, who then went on to apportion much blame for his side's demise to the San Siro pitch, which he described as \"unfit for football\". Now the Fiver's memory is shorter than that of even the most fickle fan, but we vaguely recall Milan coping with that particularly sward fairly well. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I think it makes little sense to say that there was a hardcore who did not want Andre to continue. If you look carefully, [England's Brave] John Terry and Ashley Cole always played, Didier Drogba and even Fernando Torres had lots of opportunities\" \u2013 yes, even Fernando Torres. Former Chelsea defender Alex puts the boot into Nando, without the Fiver even having to resort to gags about how many chances the striker managed to put away. FIVER LETTERS \"Do you think it's asking too much to hope that this year's two biggest non-stories could combine and Carlos Tevez would become the new Chelsea player-manager? He has experience with rebellious players after all\" - Pat Lockley. \"Apropos the Maxi Lopez 'rogue onanism pictures' (yesterday's Bits and Bobs), may I suggest he retains a good lawyer and invokes the old 'strumming chords on a pretend banjo defence'?\" - Allastair McGillivray. \"Re: yesterday's Quote of the Day. It seems Andy Gray's transformation into Chris Finch is complete.

And if you've nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. BITS AND BOBS Former Poland striker Wlodzimierz Smolarek, a key member of the team that finished third in the 1982 World Cup, has died at the age of 54 of unknown causes. Sepp Blatter has apologised to Brazilians \u2013 all 200 million of them \u2013 for being Sepp \u2026 sorry, for criticism of the country's World Cup plans by Fifa general secretary, Jerome Valcke. \"We waste time over conflicts,\" Blatter said to Leonor Menezes, 23, a shop assistant from Belo Horizonte. \"We must work together.\" Only 199,999,999 more to go, Sepp! Sepp probably needs a bit of goodwill at the minute too. A Council of Europe committee has called for his unopposed re-election as Fifa president to be investigated. \"The Assembly specifically calls on Fifa to take the necessary steps to cast full light on the facts underlying the various scandals which, in recent years, have tarnished its image and that of international football,\" stated a draft resolution that sounds boring but actually packs a nice zing. Manchester United are desperate to win Big Vase, according to Michael Carrick. Not as desperate as they were to win Big Cup, mind, but desperate nonetheless. \"We are still desperate to go as far as we would do in [Big Cup],\" warbled Carrick, ignoring the fact that they've already made it past the group stages. Newcastle United fans are offering to pay \u00a3100 on behalf of a jobless supporter who painted \"St James\" on a wall at the club's stadium in a protest over its name change. \"What he has done may have been ill-advised,\" said Graeme Cansdale of NUFC Fans United. \"However it is certainly reflective of what a lot of fans think.\" Meanwhile, the Magpies and Sunderland have been charged with misconduct by the FA following the Tyne-Wear derby. And the Pope has been treated to an audience with Lazio striker Miroslav Klose, who helped his side to victory in the Rome derby. STILL WANT MORE?

Question: This London mystery bird has a trait that is quite unusual amongst its close relatives, what is that? Can you identify these birds' taxonomic family and species? The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don't spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird's identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints so others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints may read like \"inside jokes\" and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others' enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone's enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication. You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

      "bodyText": "So, after 50 years of James Bond films, who is the nastiest villain? He was called Elliot Carver, in Tomorrow Never Dies. But thinking about it a bit more, Auric Goldfinger was probably the creepiest \u2013 soul-deep repulsion incarnate. Moonraker's Hugo Drax was Hitler with bioweapons, but he wasn't all that impressive in person. Ernst Stavro Blofeld was obviously the most prolific and proved dashed hard to kill. Elektra King (The World Is Not Enough) and Alec Trevelyan (GoldenEye) were both fallen, so they get the Shakespearean sympathy clause scored against their nastiness. And Franz Sanchez in Licence To Kill is a good contender, a really good contender. I'd say Goldfinger, Carver, Sanchez. ExGreenSlime I offer the reptilian and louche Francisco Scaramanga, The Man With The Golden Gun: \"Ours is the loneliest profession, Mr Bond.\" andongni Franz Sanchez in Licence To Kill is probably the closest thing to a real-life villain in a Bond movie, and scarier because of it. Moonraker's Hugo Drax was pretty sinister, with some of the best lines of any Bond villain: \"Look after Mr Bond. See that some harm comes to him.\" But for sheer psycho-ness, it has to be Max Zorin in A View To A Kill: the product of a Nazi genetics experiment, he sends Grace Jones to garrote Patrick McNee and laughs maniacally as he machine-guns his luckless workers in a flooded mine. eagleone Given all the recent spidery business, I nominate the tarantula on Bond's chest in Dr No. Sue Langdon, Bristol How long do house spiders live? There's one in my bathroom and I need to know when I can stop strip-washing in the downstairs loo. Telling me \"it's more scared of you than you are of it\" (N&amp;Q, 1 March) has never, never, NEVER been any help. The point is, I'm always really, really scared! What I'd like to know is why can't non-arachnophobes just blooming well remove a spider on my behalf, without having to roll their eyes or stand there taking the mickey for a good few minutes? TerriOrange Our house in Kent is infested with false widow spiders. They look like small brown black widows. They do bite, and it hurts, although they are not very dangerous. The good news is they hunt and kill the much bigger house spiders. JamesHannam I'm an expat living in Australia. Almost the first piece of advice I ever received after landing here was if it moves, kill it. I remember once sitting in my living room when I became aware of a shape next to my head on the curtain. It was an adult Huntsman (you never see the toddlers or teenagers) and it was the size of a dinner plate. Don't get me started on snakes. SydneyTaff My mother-in-law keeps conkers in the corner of each room and swears by them. The incidence of spiders in her house has decreased this year, apparently. I expressed some scepticism: the weather has been milder this year, less wet etc; perhaps fewer spiders decided to seek refuge inside, I said. So: do the conkers keep spders away? joshthedog Is it an urban myth that petrol from supermarkets is less efficient than that from the major branded suppliers? Basically this is asking whether at some point in the production process the suppliers would separate the petrol intended for supermarkets from that intended to be sold elsewhere and treat the two differently. While this is possible, I'd say it would be very unlikely and not cost effective, particularly if the only reason were to supply a customer an inferior product. CordwainerBird Our car mechanic told us that the big companies sell their old fuel off to the supermarkets and it gets cruddy and blocks the fuel injectors. We have only bought directly ever since. 01billycat Any answers? Where do garden birds go in summer? From July to the start of winter I hardly ever see blackbirds, robins, starlings etc in my garden. Sally Dignan, Frome, Somerset What are the questions that should never be asked? Nicholas Gough, Swindon, Wilts What is the likelihood of being born at different times in the year?

The charges relate to an incident which followed the Sunderland winger James McClean's 19th-minute challenge on the Newcastle full-back Danny Simpson. The FA said: \"Newcastle United and Sunderland have both been charged with misconduct following the match between the two sides on Sunday 4 March. The charge is that the clubs failed to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from provocative behaviour and is in relation to an incident which occurred in the 19th minute following a challenge by Sunderland's James McClean on Newcastle's Danny Simpson. Both clubs have until 4pm on 12 March to respond to the charge.\" Simpson was unhappy with McClean's tackle at the Gallowgate End of the stadium and his reaction sparked a 21-man melee. The referee Mike Dean restored order and cautioned McClean and Simpson, but took no further action. The incident was one of a series of flashpoints in a game in which Dean issued eight yellow cards and further reds to Sunderland's Lee Cattermole and St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon. There were repeated confrontations between the two benches, with Newcastle's goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman sent to the stands at half-time after clashing with Sunderland's fitness coach Jim Henry. Newcastle's manager Alan Pardew apologised for celebrating in front of the Sunderland bench when his side were awarded an 82nd-minute penalty. The war of words continued in the post-match press conferences with Sunderland's manager Martin O'Neill suggesting a delegation from the home coaching staff had visited the referee's room, while Pardew accused the visitors of adopting an \"ugly\" approach. O'Neill hit back on Tuesday, bringing forward a scheduled press conference with local newspaper and radio reporters to reject Pardew's claim.",

In spite of many years of humanitarian aid and development, it remains a major challenge to ensure access to water for all people. The sustainability rate on water projects in developing countries is alarmingly low, due to a lack of resources, capabilities and spare parts for service and maintenance. With the Grundfos LIFELINK solution, the Danish pump manufacturer Grundfos is applying its core competencies in solving the challenge of providing sustainable access to water for rural and peri-urban communities in the developing world. The company has developed a solution for sustainable water projects that not only includes modern pump technology driven by solar energy, but also a sustainable model for ongoing financial management and technical service. Through an innovative payment system based on mobile banking the water revenue is automatically collected and finances the ongoing service and maintenance, which is carried out by a local team of professional service technicians. Thereby, Grundfos LIFELINK is providing a self-sustaining model for water projects in rural and peri-urban areas of the developing world. It might sound simple, but in reality it is a new paradigm in delivering sustainable water supply to the people who need it the most, and it shows the potential of business in providing innovative solutions for sustainable development. Through partnerships with the government of Kenya, the UN, Danida and other development organisations, 50,000 people in rural and peri-urban areas of Kenya now have reliable access to safe water from a LIFELINK system. This means a radical improvement in quality of life for the community members, and furthermore, it has brought about new livelihood opportunities in the communities where people start small businesses with water distribution, growing crops, or investing in livestock.

Wednesday witnessed another uphill finish, in the town of Rodez, but it was of a different order, a mile-long drag to the line won by the Belgian Gianni Meersman, with Wiggins 10th. Tuesday's stage winner, Alejandro Valverde of Spain, was two places ahead of the Briton but critically unable to earn one of the time bonuses that go to the first three each day. That was a fillip for Wiggins, the more so as it was telling that Valverde, so sparkling the day before, simply ran out of steam just when he needed to wind up the pace while the race leader looked far fresher. Thursday is far tougher, although well removed from the vast Alpine ascents that await Wiggins and company in the Tour de France in July. The Croix Neuve begins like the side of a house and barely lets up for the best part of two miles. The average gradient is one-in-10 but there are passages at one-in-eight. The climb was christened Mont\u00e9e Laurent Jalabert in 2005, the 10th anniversary of the Tour when, en route to Mende, \"Jaja\" put Miguel Indurain on the rack in a legendary Bastille Day exploit. Thursday is unlikely to match that epic, but it should be decisive. The gap to Wiggins's main challenger, Levi Leipheimer of the US, is just six seconds, while at Mende the margins should be far greater. Wiggins heads for Mende in a very different state to his last visit, during the Tour de France in 2010, when he was wracked with self-doubt and struggling to stay with the best in an increasingly torrid attempt to repeat his fine ride the previous year. With the help of a revamped coaching team he has turned himself round since then, riding consistently among the best since finishing third in this race last year. \"You've got to have the legs and I'm in this position because I've got the legs,\" said Wiggins afterwards. \"There will be no tactics [on Thursday], just empty the tanks for about six minutes. It's not like a 10-15 kilometre climb, where a lot can happen. I will just empty the tank and we will see where it puts me.\" Meanwhile, in Donoratico on the Tuscany coast, a Team Sky squad including the world road race champion Mark Cavendish raced to fourth in the team time trial that opened the Tirreno-Adriatico 'Race of Two Seas', where the Manxman is honing his form for his first major objective of the season, 2012's opening one-day Classic, Milan-San Remo on 17 March.",

      "bodyText": "Paul Burstow, the care services minister, has indicated that he would like to see telehealth and telecare services provided to the NHS without the need for up-front capital payments. Speaking at the King's Fund international congress on telehealth and telecare, Burstow said a community nurse supervisor should be able to pay for a blood pressure monitor through a monthly contract, in a similar way to that in which people pay for iPhones or Blackberrys. Such a strategy is already used in Gloucestershire, where the NHS is working with provider Tunstall. The company covers the up-front costs, such as clinical engagement, pathway redesign and training, and supplies NHS Gloucestershire on a per patient per month basis. \"NHS Gloucester avoids the need for large scale up-front costs, and it enables the supplier to build relationships with patients and customers that it otherwise would not have,\" the minister said. Burstow also predicted that in time the cost of the telehealth and telecare technologies will start to fall. \"Costs in the UK are significantly higher than they are in the US, and it is no wonder because in the current situation we have only 6,000 users, compared to 10 times that number in the veterans' association in the US,\" said Burstow. \"That is why we are looking at promoting our campaign, 3millionlives, why we want to grow this rapidly.\" One of the principal challenges to the large scale take up of telehealth and telecare is broadband capacity, said Burstow, particularly because many of those who stand to benefit from the technologies live in rural areas where broadband provision is worst, although the government has earmarked \u00a3530m of funding to improve the situation. There are also issues, according to Burstow, with NHS and social care staff not having sufficient skills and understanding about telehealth and telecare. To resolve this issue, the government has asked the NHS Institute to develop a support programme for staff and patients so they can make the most of these technologies at a local level.

      "bodyText": "The generous legacy of the late Jimi Heselden, who died in an accident on one of the Segway scooters which his firm made in Leeds, has taken another step forward. A fund to support community and social enterprises and skills-teaching in his native east Leeds has been set up with an initial \u00a3500,000 from his legacy. The money will be given in grants under these five broad heads: *enabling local people and communities to gain skills and experience and move into work or self-employment; *creating and developing enterprising and income-generating activity that meets community needs; *helping people who are not in work; *developing vocational skills; *and supporting vulnerable people. Known as Jimbo's East Leeds Enterprise Fund, the scheme is an offshoot of the larger Jimbo's Fund which gives grants of up to \u00a320,000 to charitable projects in east Leeds and has distributed \u00a3900,000 in the last year. Sally-Anne Greenfield, chief executive of Leeds Community Foundation, which received a total of \u00a323,000,000 from Heselden in his lifetime, says This new Fund has been launched following discussions with the Jimbo's Fund grants panel which includes members of Jimi's family. They are keen to support activities that can have a longer-term impact on local people and communities and that will be a lasting legacy to Jimi in the part of Leeds where he grew up, worked and built his business Hesco Bastion. The new fund is different to the existing main Jimbo's Fund in that it specifically focuses on enterprise-related activities and on projects that can tackle social issues in an area of Leeds which has high unemployment and deprivation. Following best charitable practice, the idea of the new fund was followed up with consultations in east Leeds run by the co-operative group Y Co-Co. They discussed priorities with 40 local organisations and reported back to the main Jimbo's Fund which then gave the go-ahead. Greenfield says: We are looking to fund five to ten projects that will receive between \u00a325,000 and \u00a350,000 for capital or revenue requirements over approximately a 12-month period from June 2012. For exceptional projects, and consortia applications, we will consider grants of up to \u00a3100,000. The fund is open to charities, community groups and existing social enterprises which are based in or have strong links to Leeds 9, 14, 15 and whose projects can demonstrate longer term benefits to local residents. Expressions of interest are invited from now until March 23. Then the most eligible will invited to submit more detailed applications by April 20. Grants will be determined in May for distribution in June.

Ananda Marchildon, 25, is now entitled to the remainder of the prize money she won four years ago in the television show Holland's Next Top Model, which the agency, Elite, withheld after arguing she had not lost enough weight. The Amsterdam district court said on Wednesday that Marchildon should receive \u20ac65,000 (\u00a354,000) equivalent to the rest of the three-year contract she was awarded, of which she only received \u20ac10,000 before her dismissal. Much of the case hung on whether or not Marchildon had been asked to reduce her hip size to below what it had been when she won. An email exchange between the two parties provided key evidence. On 23 March 2010, the agency wrote to the model: \"Today \u2026 we measured your hips at 98 centimeters [sic]. This is a reminder! The goal is that you have a hip circumference of no more than 90 cm at the end of June.\" Marchildon, who said she went on a strict diet and took copious amounts of exercise, responded that she was prepared to regain her former shape but would go no further. \"If at the end of the road it appears that unfortunately not enough assignments have come in, that doesn't change the obligations of the contract,\" she wrote. But according to the court ruling although the 180cm tall (5'11\") model had put on weight since gaining the contract, she had had a hip measurement of 92cm (36.2 inches) at the time of winning and the agency went too far by demanding she reduce it to 90cm. \"Elite had no right to demand Marchildon reach a hip size of 90cm,\" the court ruled. After the ruling Marchildon told the Daily Beast: \"A huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. After almost two years of struggling I was finally proven right.\" She was commissioned for a photo shoot on Wednesday by an underwear company who called Marchildon \"a beautiful woman\", adding: \"It's too crazy for words that a model who's her size would be written off as too fat.\" In a statement, Marchildon, who became a cabinet maker after leaving the agency last September, said she planned to return to making furniture.",

      "bodyText": "For you, LulzSec, the war is over. Maybe. In an astonishing series of revelations, the FBI on Tuesday issued charges against four individuals alleged to be principal members of the hacking collective, and another alleged to be a member of its sister group, Anonymous. But more staggering still was how the evidence against these individuals was gathered. The LulzSec member known as Sabu, revealed to be an unemployed 28-year-old New Yorker named Hector Xavier Monsegur, had been caught by the FBI in June 2011, and by August had pleaded guilty to hacking offences with a maximum sentence of 124 years and six months. Ever since, he had worked to provide evidence against his suspected former cohorts. According the FBI charge sheet, the degree of Sabu's co-operation with the FBI is extraordinary. Through him, the authorities apparently had the inside track on a series of audacious hacks, including the recording of an FBI conference call and the lifting of 5m emails from a US intelligence publisher, Stratfor. Indictments show Sabu encouraging other online aliases during attacks, and suggesting thousands of passwords publicly. On Twitter, Sabu's account continued to threaten the \"Feds\" and post encouragingly on new attacks. Through Sabu, the FBI were aware of the attack on Stratfor's servers even as it was ongoing \u2013 and seemingly did not inform the company. An FBI storage server was even offered to Anonymous on which to store the hacked documents. Many will feel unease at the FBI's nine-month penetration of LulzSec and \u2013 at the very least \u2013 parts of Anonymous. Concerns about incitement and entrapment will be raised. Companies subject to some of the attacks by the groups may also feel aggrieved: could the authorities have stopped some of them if they'd wanted to? It seems they could. But to focus solely on these concerns misses a wider series of problems in clamping down on hackers, and maintaining law and order, online. It is important to note that Monsegur aside, the other individuals named in the US charge sheets are innocent unless proven guilty. But whoever carried out the assorted hacking attacks, the nature of these groups and their motivations are known: their membership is generally young, often in the late teens, and attacks are often politically motivated. The ethos isn't fixed, but there are some creeds: anti-corporate, anti-censorship, libertarian and definitely anti-surveillance. The damaging consequences of Anonymous and LulzSec hacks shouldn't be understated, but motivations were rarely financial: where credit cards were taken, for example in the Stratfor hack, they were used more for charitable donations or purchasing servers for Anonymous use than for financial gain. If the theme of a young, anti-corporate group engaging in civil disobediance seems familiar, it should. The Occupy movement and Anonymous are strikingly alike in both their organisation, their tactics and their goals. But while most Occupiers who are arrested \u2013 and even these are a minority \u2013 face relatively mild sanctions (typically non-custodial), a single count of a hacking offence in the UK or US can carry a 10-year prison sentence. In the online realm, a single knowledgeable hacker engaging in civil disobedience can cause more trouble than a single protester. At present, this is often dealt with simply by punishing them more harshly, using laws intended to hit those engaged in industrial-scale theft or espionage. But legal inconsistency spell trouble, too. In Germany, participating in an attack aimed at temporarily taking a website offline (known as a denial of service attack) are recognised as the online equivalent of a sit-in protest, and may not qualify as criminal offences. Elsewhere, it can lead to imprisonment. Protesters moving online may find the laws dramatically harsher than their offline equivalents: a gradual criminalisation of dissent. There is a wider concern. No one's computer is safer in any meaningful way as a result of the FBI's actions. Anonymous may be the most famous hacking group in the world \u2013 and may yet bounce back even from these latest developments \u2013 but even at its peak it was far from the most dangerous. Breaking into systems and defacing sites, boasting publicly about what you've done will certainly get you noticed \u2013 but that's not what the biggest players do. Professional hacking is big business, often operating from Russia, Africa and South America where enforcement is lax. Breaking into systems to glean credit card details on a huge scale is a major operation \u2013 and the last thing these guys would do is inform an individual or business that they've compromised their system. The longer you can stay inside and steal information unnoticed, the better. And then there are the growing numbers of government-sanctioned hackers used to engage in cyberwar. Accusations fly against China, Israel and the US and many others \u2013 but for obvious reasons, individuals are never brought to justice. That the most high-profile hacking arrests of recent times comes from a group dedicated to online civil disobedience signals nothing good: at best \u2013 and it's a disturbing best \u2013 it means that these are the only suspected hackers the authorities are able to catch. At worst, it means Anonymous are the only hackers they're chasing. \u2022 For legal reasons, this article will not be open to comments",

An FBI storage server was even offered to Anonymous on which to store the hacked documents.</p> <p>Many will feel unease at the FBI's nine-month penetration of LulzSec and \u2013 at the very least \u2013 parts of Anonymous. Concerns about incitement and entrapment will be raised.</p> <p>Companies subject to some of the attacks by the groups may also feel aggrieved: could the authorities have stopped some of them if they'd wanted to? It seems they could.</p> <p>But to focus solely on these concerns misses a wider series of problems in clamping down on hackers, and maintaining law and order, online.</p> <p>It is important to note that Monsegur aside, the other individuals named in the US charge sheets are innocent unless proven guilty.</p> <p>But whoever carried out the assorted hacking attacks, the nature of these groups and their motivations are known: their membership is generally young, often in the late teens, and attacks are often politically motivated. The ethos isn't fixed, but there are some creeds: anti-corporate, anti-censorship, libertarian and definitely anti-surveillance.</p> <p>The damaging consequences of Anonymous and LulzSec hacks shouldn't be understated, but motivations were rarely financial: where credit cards were taken, for example in the Stratfor hack, they were used more for charitable donations or purchasing servers for Anonymous use than for financial gain.</p> <p>If the theme of a young, anti-corporate group engaging in civil disobediance seems familiar, it should. The Occupy movement and Anonymous are strikingly alike in both their organisation, their tactics and their goals.</p> <p>But while most Occupiers who are arrested \u2013 and even these are a minority \u2013 face relatively mild sanctions (typically non-custodial), a single count of a hacking offence in the UK or US can carry a 10-year prison sentence.</p> <p>In the online realm, a single knowledgeable hacker engaging in civil disobedience can cause more trouble than a single protester. At present, this is often dealt with simply by punishing them more harshly, using laws intended to hit those engaged in industrial-scale theft or espionage.</p> <p>But legal inconsistency spell trouble, too. In Germany, participating in an attack aimed at temporarily taking a website offline (known as a denial of service attack) are recognised as the online equivalent of a sit-in protest, and may not qualify as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/01/online-dissent-democracy-hacking\" title=\"\">criminal offences</a>. Elsewhere, it can lead to imprisonment.</p> <p>Protesters moving online may find the laws dramatically harsher than their offline equivalents: a gradual criminalisation of dissent.</p> <p>There is a wider concern. No one's computer is safer in any meaningful way as a result of the FBI's actions. Anonymous may be the most famous hacking group in the world \u2013 and may yet bounce back even from these latest developments \u2013 but even at its peak it was far from the most dangerous.</p> <p>Breaking into systems and defacing sites, boasting publicly about what you've done will certainly get you noticed \u2013 but that's not what the biggest players do.</p> <p>Professional hacking is big business, often operating from Russia, Africa and South America where enforcement is lax.</p> <p>Breaking into systems to glean credit card details on a huge scale is a major operation \u2013 and the last thing these guys would do is inform an individual or business that they've compromised their system. The longer you can stay inside and steal information unnoticed, the better.</p> <p>And then there are the growing numbers of government-sanctioned hackers used to engage in cyberwar. Accusations fly against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/04/wikileaks-cables-google-china-hacking\" title=\"\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agency?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Israel</a> and the US and many others \u2013 but for obvious reasons, individuals are never brought to justice.</p> <p>That the most high-profile hacking arrests of recent times comes from a group dedicated to online civil disobedience signals nothing good: at best \u2013 and it's a disturbing best \u2013 it means that these are the only suspected hackers the authorities are able to catch.</p> <p>At worst, it means Anonymous are the only hackers they're chasing.</p> <p>\u2022 For legal reasons, this article will not be open to comments</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every week we invite our readers to tell us about where they go to watch films. This week it's the turn of Edwin Davies, who writes about film at A Mighty Fine Blog. Location Based opposite the train station in Sheffield, the Showroom manages to be right at the centre of the city yet just far enough away to feel like it's off the beaten track. That sense of being accessible but also outside the mainstream extends to the whole feel of the cinema, which balances a sense of arty affectation with a homey, accessible vibe. Building Occupying an art deco structure that was originally a car dealership, the Showroom was converted into a cinema in the early '90s and boasts four screens, a bar and a cafe, all of which take advantage of the building's angular architecture to create a laidback, bohemian atmosphere. The box office, restaurant and foyer are all situated in open, airy spaces, while the screening rooms themselves range in size from large and spacious to compact and intimate, like an air-raid shelter without the sense of impending doom. Clientele Since the Showroom is located directly opposite the Sheffield Hallam student's union, students unsurprisingly make up a large part of its audience, and they're amply catered for by the programme, which offers regular opportunities to see cult favourites such as Withnail &amp; I. It also has a fairly large following among the over-55s \u2013 the \"Early Doors\" senior screenings are routinely sold out. The Showroom also has plenty of screenings for children, a strand which extends to Showcomotion, its own festival dedicated to films for children. Programme In addition to the latest arthouse fare, which at the moment consists mainly of the heavy hitters from the awards season, the Showroom also screens a large number of classic works from Hollywood and beyond. Thanks to its close ties with Sheffield Hallam's film department, it is able to offer seasons on directors such as Werner Herzog, or more esoteric topics such as representations of medieval society in films. They even find time for the odd blockbuster or two now and then. Further comments The Showroom distinguishes itself from a lot of arthouse cinemas by having enough screens to give it a full and varied schedule. The programme can be intimidatingly dense, with up to a dozen films screening on a single day, something which is pretty much unheard of outside of multiplexes. My burgeoning love of cinema was very much fostered by the Showroom: I discovered it just after moving to Sheffield in 2004 and the first film I saw there was End of the Century, the Ramones documentary. From then onwards, The Showroom became a pretty central part of my cultural experience, as it has for many of Sheffield's film fans, and I saw many of the films that inspired me to write about cinema there. It's also a strong part of the cultural heart of Sheffield, often playing host to the work of local artists and putting on nights for local musicians. Its relationship with Sheffield-based production studio Warp Films has led it to host special screenings of many of Shane Meadows's films, as well as the premieres of both series of This Is England, and it also acted as a location for the Arctic Monkeys' video for Leave Before the Lights Go On and a scene in Chris Morris's Four Lions. For the curious, the scene in question is the one in which Kevin Eldon argues with his fellow officers over whether a Wookie is a bear, and it was filmed on the roof of the cinema, much to the bemusement of patrons of the cinema, who wondered why armed police were swarming over the building. The Showroom is a charming cinema with a great atmosphere that nicely complements the sort of idiosyncratic and offbeat films it screens.

      "bodyText": "Dropping to the floor and doing press-ups for punishment is a common experience for cadets at an army boot camp. But for pouting shop assistants at one of Milan's upmarket clothes stores, the policy has come as a rude shock. Male staff at American-owned Abercrombie &amp; Fitch have been forced to do 10 press-ups each time they make a mistake, and female employees must do 10 squat thrusts, according to the union CGIL, which has complained about the policy. An email sent to staff by a manager and obtained by the union states that the physical punishment will ensure \"we will learn more from our mistakes\". One former employee quoted by Corriere della Sera said staff would be ordered to perform the exercises in front of a manager for minor infractions. \"It just works like that, take it or leave it,\" he said. Perfect abs are a key policy at the store, where young male assistants greet shoppers with torsos bared. \"To ensure they have the right look, female staff are told to scrub their makeup off if they wear too much and men are ordered home to shave if they have stubble,\" said a union officer, Graziella Carneri. In 2004 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was hit by a US class action lawsuit for discrimination by a group of black, Hispanic and Asian people who claimed they were not hired or kept away from shoppers. The store settled for $40m while admitting no wrongdoing. In 2009 a London staff member with a prosthetic arm won damages after she told how Abercrombie &amp; Fitch \"hid\" her in the stock room because she did not fit the firm's look. Separately, workers in a factory in southern Italy recently claimed they were ordered to stand up and say \"I am a shit\" in front of colleagues after making mistakes.",

But for pouting shop assistants at one of Milan's upmarket clothes stores, the policy has come as a rude shock.</p> <p>Male staff at American-owned Abercrombie &amp; Fitch have been forced to do 10 press-ups each time they make a mistake, and female employees must do 10 squat thrusts, according to the union CGIL, which has complained about the policy.</p> <p>An email sent to staff by a manager and obtained by the union states that the physical punishment will ensure \"we will learn more from our mistakes\".</p> <p>One former employee quoted by Corriere della Sera said staff would be ordered to perform the exercises in front of a manager for minor infractions. \"It just works like that, take it or leave it,\" he said.</p> <p>Perfect abs are a key policy at the store, where young male assistants greet shoppers with torsos bared. \"To ensure they have the right look, female staff are told to scrub their makeup off if they wear too much and men are ordered home to shave if they have stubble,\" said a union officer, Graziella Carneri.</p> <p>In 2004 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was hit by a US class action lawsuit for discrimination by a group of black, Hispanic and Asian people who claimed they were not hired or kept away from shoppers.

      "bodyText": "Robert Quick, formerly Britain's top counter-terrorism officer, has alleged that his senior Scotland Yard colleagues buckled under Conservative party pressure and withdrew their support for an investigation of a Tory frontbench spokesman who had received leaks which allegedly endangered national security. Quick told the Leveson inquiry on Wednesday that the arrest in 2008 of the Conservative immigration spokesperson, Damian Green, sparked outrage from senior Tories and Conservative-leaning papers. Quick said the furore led the then acting commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson to ask him to halt the criminal investigation. Quick alleged that Green had not just received the leaks but encouraged a civil servant to pass on information that may have endangered national security. Quick said his investigation began after a complaint from the government that material had been stolen from the safe of the then-home secretary's private office. Green, who is now an immigration minister, was arrested in November 2008 by Scotland Yard. The arrest and search of Green's House of Commons office provoked uproar. David Cameron, then leader of the opposition, condemned it, as did London mayor Boris Johnson, who is now in control of setting the Yard's budget and strategic priorities, as well as having the power to fire the commissioner. Christopher Galley, a civil servant, was also arrested. The Crown Prosecution Service decided in April 2009 not to prosecute either Green or Galley. Quick said that after Galley was released, he phoned Green, who allegedly said the civil servant should \"plead not guilty and 'do not mention David Davis'\", the senior Tory whom Galley had first contacted offering to leak information to embarrass the Labour government. Quick said he had thoroughly checked the law at every stage, and had the support of Stephenson before the arrest. But after the Tory explosion of anger, the acting commissioner withdrew his support, Quick claimed. The row erupted weeks after London's Tory mayor had effectively fired Ian Blair as Met commissioner. Quick told the inquiry that after Tory criticism of Green's arrest, Stephenson claimed he had written his resignation. (Stephenson would go on to be appointed as Met commissioner.) Quick, then the national coordinator for counter-terrorism and an assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, resigned in April 2009 over a separate mistake, when he was photographed entering No 10 with a briefing note on counter-terrorism on display. The use of police resources was \"debatable\", according to a report on the affair by the Inspectorate of Constabulary, while an internal police review said Green's arrest was \"not proportionate\". Quick claimed he had been forced to move his children out of his home amid security fears after the Mail on Sunday published details about a business run by his wife, Judith, and staffed by former police officers. Quick apologised in December 2008 after claiming that the Tories and their supporters were \"mobilised \u2026 in a wholly corrupt way\" against his investigation into Green's relationship with the home office civil servant. Quick was formerly head of specialist operations at Scotland Yard.",

      "bodyText": "Scientists today measure the Earth's surface temperature using thermometers at weather stations and on ships and buoys all over the world. Such thermometer records cover a large fraction of the globe going back to the mid-19th century, allowing scientists to determine a global average temperature trend for the last 160 years. Before that time not many thermometer records are available, so scientists use indirect temperature measurements, supported by anecdotal evidence recorded by diarists, and the few thermometer records that do exist. Scientists must rely solely on indirect methods to look back further than recorded human history. Indirect ways of assessing past temperatures, using so-called temperature proxies, take measurements of responses to past temperature change that are preserved in natural archives such as ice, rocks and fossils. For example, ice sheets form as snow builds up, with each year's snowfall preserved as a single, visible layer. There are measurable chemical differences in snow formed at different temperatures, so ice cores provide a record of polar temperature going back around 250,000 years for Greenland and 800,000 years for Antarctica. Yearly banding is also found in fossilised corals and lake sediment deposits, and each band has a specific chemistry that reflects the temperature when it formed. Growth rings in tree trunks can be wider or thinner depending on the climate at the time of growth, so fossilised trees can reveal the length of growing seasons. And fossilised or frozen pollen grains allow scientists to determine what plants were growing in the past, which can give us a good idea of the climate at the time. Marine sediment cores provide temperature records spanning millions of years. They contain the fossilised shells of tiny marine creatures that preserve a chemical record of the sea temperature when they lived. To make their temperature reconstructions as accurate as possible scientists have calibrated each proxy by testing how it changes in response to changing temperature. However, the further back in time we look, the more sparse the proxy temperature records become. Therefore the most reliable way to work out past temperatures is to combine different proxies \u2013 and to use data from many locations to screen out local temperature fluctuations. \u2022 This article was written by Carbon Brief in conjunction with the Guardian and partners The ultimate climate change FAQ \u2022 This answer last updated: 01.03.2012 \u2022 Read about the project and suggest a question \u2022 Report an error in this answer \u2022 Browse all questions and answers Related questions \u2022 Are humans definitely causing global warming? \u2022 How much warmer will the planet get? \u2022 What are climate change feedback loops?

Now the trustee of a temple in Bihar has decided to do something about it \u2013 he is building a full-scale replica of the 12th century temple of Angkor Wat on the banks of the Ganges river, near the state capital Patna. \"The Angkor Wat temple in Bihar will be as majestic as the original, and slightly larger \u2013 it will be 222ft by 222ft, and its five shikharas [towers] will also be 222ft high,\" said Kishore Kunal, who runs the Mahavir Mandir temple trust in Patna. \"And when it's ready in 10 years time, it will be a functioning temple, employing at least a dozen priests.\" The project, Kunal estimates, will cost at least 600m rupees (\u00a37.5m) \u2013 half to create the basic structure, the rest for the embellishments, including sculptures of gods and goddesses. The replica, though, will not be ringed by a moat nor have a palace on its campus. But the main difference will be in the temple's presiding deity. The original Khmer temple at Angkor, built in the 12th century by a Hindu king from a dynasty linked to southern India and now a Unesco world heritage site, was dedicated to Vishnu. Bihar's replica will be called the Virat Angkor Wat Ram Mandir, and will have Ram as the main deity, flanked by his consort Sita, who is said to have been a native of the state. Ram, though, is an avatar of Vishnu and, according to legend, the Hindu god once crossed the Ganges at the very spot where the temple dedicated to him will be constructed. Kunal, a 61-year-old retired police officer, has never visited the original temple complex in Cambodia, which moved from Hindu to Buddhist use in the 13th century. He is planning his first visit soon but hopes that thousands of Indians who cannot afford to visit Angkor Wat will be able to experience its grandeur by visiting the replica nearer home. Under Kunal's management, the Mahavir Mandir temple trust has built three hospitals in Patna, while as head of the state religious trust board, he has restored 12 historical temples in Bihar. The trust will finance half the cost of the replica temple. \"Those who know me know I complete my projects,\" he said. Kunal conducted the temple's groundbreaking ceremony on Monday. Since the style of the original Angkor Wat was influenced by Dravidian architecture, with its typical storeyed towers, traditional South Indian temple builders are being hired for the project in Bihar. The basic structure will be in concrete clad in granite, since using stone, as in the original, will double the cost and take twice as long to complete. The towers will be fashioned from stone fragments using an ancient technique. \"Someone told me the Cambodians are upset that I'm creating a replica of Angkor Wat,\" he said. \"But why should they? If the Taj Mahal is recreated in the UK, we won't mind. We'll feel happy.\"",

He is planning his first visit soon but hopes that thousands of Indians who cannot afford to visit Angkor Wat will be able to experience its grandeur by visiting the replica nearer home.</p> <p>Under Kunal's management, the Mahavir Mandir temple trust has built three hospitals in Patna, while as head of the state religious trust board, he has restored 12 historical temples in Bihar. The trust will finance half the cost of the replica temple. \"Those who know me know I complete my projects,\" he said.</p> <p>Kunal conducted the temple's groundbreaking ceremony on Monday. Since the style of the original Angkor Wat was influenced by Dravidian architecture, with its typical storeyed towers, traditional South Indian temple builders are being hired for the project in Bihar. The basic structure will be in concrete clad in granite, since using stone, as in the original, will double the cost and take twice as long to complete. The towers will be fashioned from stone fragments using an ancient technique.</p> <p>\"Someone told me the Cambodians are upset that I'm creating a replica of Angkor Wat,\" he said. \"But why should they? If the Taj Mahal is recreated in the UK, we won't mind. We'll feel happy.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "About six years ago, I was at a fashion show in New York. It was a Michael Kors show, to be precise, and while it was only my second time covering the fashion shows in Manhattan, it was more than long enough for me to have become, oh, ever so jaded about this fashion lark. Yes, yes, high-waisted trousers and angora jumpers: well done, Michael Kors, for knocking out some Ralph Lauren rip-offs \u2013 bravo, I snippily wrote in my notebook, making my snarkiest of fashion-writer eye-rolls. Then I noticed a slight, self-effacing white-haired chap squatting on the floor next to my seat, sporting a blue windcheater and clicking away on a camera that looked and, indeed, was about half a century old. His impish grin never dimmed, which is impressive considering we were at a Michael Kors show (sorry \u2013 fashion-writer snarkiness is hard to shake off). He was probably the only person in the room who was smiling, and definitely the only man there not sporting cashmere. Bill Cunningham, the legendary style photographer for the New York Times, had been covering fashion for about 20 times longer than my pathetic handful of years, yet he looked as unjaded as if this were his very first time. Watching him snap away gleefully on his camera made me realise that Cunningham sees fashion in a different way from most people in the business. He doesn't frantically look for trends, or try to score cheap points with snarky jibes: he simply enjoys the aesthetic pleasure that beautiful and original clothes give to his eyes. It put my studied cynicism to shame. Bill Cunningham New York, the breathtaking documentary film about this still hardworking octogenarian, made me realise that my view of the man himself was as shallow as my view of fashion. Cunningham is no mere clothing enthusiast. The first thing to say about Bill Cunningham New York is that it is not a fashion movie. In fact, fashion hardly features in it. It is about the gentrification of New York, the commercialisation of creativity, the effect of religion on an individual's life, the determination to work when many of your colleagues are a quarter of your age, and how to maintain integrity in the materialistic worlds of Manhattan and the fashion industry. It also shows how Cunningham's seemingly simple weekly column in the New York Times, On the Street, in which he photographs people out and about whose clothes have caught his eye, has influenced the fashion world immeasurably, inspiring a new generation of journalists and bloggers as well as being copied by advertisers. But just as Cunningham's photographs spotlight an individual's style rather than mass-market trends, so Bill Cunningham New York keeps its focus very much on the story of the man himself within these big themes, and it is a story that will knock your socks off. I saw the film in New York this winter and when Cunningham finally vocalised the nub of his tale, the whole cinema gasped. This scene \u2013 and you will known the one I mean when you see the film, and you must see it \u2013 will come close to breaking your heart. \"We're in the age of the cookie-cutter sameness. There are few that are rarities, someone who doesn't look like 10 million others,\" Cunningham says in the film, scouring the street, looking for an \"exotic bird of paradise\" to photograph. But the most extraordinary original is Cunningham himself, a gentleman whose permanent smile papers over tragedy, a modern-day anachronism who finds real beauty within the frivolity, a man of true grit in a chiffon world. Bill Cunningham New York is in cinemas from Friday and is released on DVD on 2 April. Hadley Freeman will discuss the film on The Culture Show on BBC2 on Friday 9 March at 7pm.",

It was a woman, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, who subverted sacred music with the secular to forge one of the first rock records, Strange Things Happening Every Day, but it's men \u2013 specifically that four-white-guys stereotype \u2013 that we celebrate as rock's ultimate chalice-bearers today. Rock's narrative is written in a way that excludes women who noodle, shred and expand the music in new directions. Where the roots of rock were sewn by black and female musicians, the genre has been whitewashed, evolving its sound but narrowing its gaze, pwnd by the male quartet. Music's cyclical nature means rock flourishes and wanes. During the ebbs, rock's death knell is proclaimed, mostly by a music press written by, about and for men, but to perceive last year's ebb in the rock-boy-band flow as a some sort of crisis ignores the large amount of exciting rock being made by women. I wasn't alone in appreciating EMA's Past Life Martyred Saints, St Vincent's Strange Mercy and Anna Calvi's Mercury-nominated debut. Then there was a wonderful album and thrilling live shows from Wild Flag, and the emergence of the Alabama Shakes. Those artists excited critics and fans with their inventive take on rock. In Anna Calvi's circular picking technique, rock took a gothic, grandiose turn, swirling with orchestra-sized tensions. In St Vincent's cerebral, film-inspired narratives, chords were out and muscular, fret-shattering licks ruled. In EMA's Past Life Martyred Saints, droning, Midwest-to-California blues voyages took both classic rock and feedback-drenched noise to new heights. As far as I could see, rock was being hewn in to huge, fantastical new shapes. Rock sounded brilliant, and very much alive, from where I was standing. When virtuoso female guitarists appear on the rock radar, they tend to gain the spotlight in the lulls between dominant, malecentric scenes (Britpop, grunge, glam rock), celebrated in isolation as brief, intermittent flashes of brilliance that flare up between the wider, collective scenes. When these women are innovative enough to operate successfully outside a zeitgeist, and gain an audience without the legitimacy and safety of a wider scene, they are seen as ancillary to rock's larger, holistic pantheon. They are rounded up for \"women in rock\" trend pieces where \"gender is genre\", a rock press narrative that creates a separate, and implicitly lesser, form of rock. PJ Harvey's record-breaking contributions to indie rock are redoubtable, but rock's one-in one-out policy for women has made her an inescapable comparison for any rock woman standing alone with a six string and toe pressed to a distortion pedal. EMA, St Vincent and Calvi continually cite male inspirations when interviewed, from Jimi Hendrix and Scott Walker to Lou Reed and Bo Diddley, direct, explicit statements that they're creating in the tradition of rock gods, yet each of these artists have been cast, at one point or another, as indebted to Harvey, sometimes in the face of polite protestations. Creating a separate (slow) lane for women, where rock matriarchs, however hallowed, are women's only forebears, keeps rock divided. It divorces female musicians from their privileged forefathers, denies them their artistic lineage, and creates a system where women with electric guitars can only be as good as the women that came before them, celebrated on pedestals but never shoulder to shoulder with favoured male peers. If rock learned to celebrate more than one image as authentic and valuable, maybe that old death bell wouldn't ring quite so regularly.",

Then there was a wonderful album and thrilling live shows from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/02/wild-flag-review\">Wild Flag</a>, and the emergence of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/aug/18/hail-hail-rock-n-roll\">the Alabama Shakes</a>. Those artists excited critics and fans with their inventive take on rock. In Anna Calvi's circular picking technique, rock took a gothic, grandiose turn, swirling with orchestra-sized tensions. In St Vincent's cerebral, film-inspired narratives, chords were out and muscular, fret-shattering licks ruled. In EMA's Past Life Martyred Saints, droning, Midwest-to-California blues voyages took both classic rock and feedback-drenched noise to new heights. As far as I could see, rock was being hewn in to huge, fantastical new shapes. Rock sounded brilliant, and very much alive, from where I was standing. </p> <p>When virtuoso female guitarists appear on the rock radar, they tend to gain the spotlight in the lulls between dominant, malecentric scenes (Britpop, grunge, glam rock), celebrated in isolation as brief, intermittent flashes of brilliance that flare up between the wider, collective scenes. When these women are innovative enough to operate successfully outside a zeitgeist, and gain an audience without the legitimacy and safety of a wider scene, they are seen as ancillary to rock's larger, holistic pantheon. They are rounded up for \"women in rock\" trend pieces where \"gender is genre\", a rock press narrative that creates a separate, and implicitly lesser, form of rock. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/pjharvey\">PJ Harvey</a>'s record-breaking contributions to indie rock are redoubtable, but rock's one-in one-out policy for women has made her an inescapable comparison for any rock woman standing alone with a six string and toe pressed to a distortion pedal. EMA, St Vincent and Calvi continually cite male inspirations when interviewed, from Jimi Hendrix and Scott Walker to Lou Reed and Bo Diddley, direct, explicit statements that they're creating in the tradition of rock gods, yet each of these artists have been cast, at one point or another, as indebted to Harvey, sometimes in the face of polite protestations. </p> <p>Creating <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/9124443/Pops-20-greatest-female-artists.html\">a separate (slow) lane for women</a>, where rock matriarchs, however hallowed, are women's only forebears, keeps rock divided. It divorces female musicians from their privileged forefathers, denies them their artistic lineage, and creates a system where women with electric guitars can only be as good as the women that came before them, celebrated on pedestals but never shoulder to shoulder with favoured male peers. If rock learned to celebrate more than one image as authentic and valuable, maybe that old death bell wouldn't ring quite so regularly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Europe's second largest car maker, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, has added weight to the industry's call for European Union help in tackling the continent's manufacturing capacity problem. Excess factory space has become a dominant topic of discussion at the Geneva Motor Show, as executives discuss how to cut back on plants that, according to analysts, produce at least 1m more cars than the European market needs every year. Philippe Varin, PSA's chief executive and former boss of steelmaker Corus, said Brussels could draw lessons from historic interventions in the steel sector. \"We have experience in the past \u2026 the example of the steel industry where it [overcapacity] was a problem, it was addressed at the EU level and it was addressed very efficiently. So why don't we draw some lessons from the past. It would be very useful.\" However, Varin said there had to be \"willingness\" among EU officials to intervene. Varin's comments follow a call for political intervention from the European car industry association, the ACEA. Speaking at Geneva this week, the ACEA's general secretary, Ivan Hodac, said: \"We cannot continue endlessly deal with automotive issues at the national level.\" He added: \"We need an EU-wide solution. But it is not easy.\" The chief executive of Fiat, Sergio Marchionne, said a \"structural fix\" needed to be \"managed and addressed by the European Union as the holder and repository of the notion of the single market.\" Analysts have raised the possibility of the EU relaxing rules to make the firing of workers cheaper, but European car makers have yet to reveal what shape their apeals for assistance might take. GM, maker of the Vauxhall and Opel brands in Europe, has found itself at the centre of the restructuring story amid concerted lobbying by the UK government and trade unions to keep the UK's Ellesmere Port plant open and preserve 2,800 jobs. Last month PSA signed a worldwide alliance with GM that saw the US car group take a 7% stake in its French competitor. Sources close to the discussions over Ellesmere Port believe that GM will outline further details on its capacity plans, which could clarify the future for Ellesmere Port, at an executive gathering on 28 March. Speaking at a press briefing in Geneva on Wednesday, Varin said the GM alliance would have no bearing on restructuring capacity at both car makers. However, Varin said the PSA and GM could share production facilities in five years' time after they agreed to develop vehicles together as part of the alliance. \"This is one option which is open for the long-term.\" He added: \"We can make Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars, so you can imagine that we can do that in the future with some GM models.\" Varin's comments could alarm Ellesmere Port's supporters, who are concerned that the plant will be squeezed out by GM and are keen to know the car maker's production plans beyond 2014. GM has pledged to uphold a labour agreement that prohibits plant closures at its European operations before 2014. Employees at Ellesmere Port, where Astra cars are made, want to secure the production of new GM models that will provide some form of assurance about the plant's future. Ellesmere Port's backers believe those plans could become clearer on 28 March if GM produces an outline business plan for 2012 to 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Updated 6pm: Don't call the Daily Telegraph the Torygraph ever again. It is running a couple of blogs today laying into David Cameron's current Tory party. One blog, headlined The Conservatives will lose in 2015. Thank God, is a full-frontal attack on Cameron's version of conservatism. It is written by Ed West, who is described as \"a journalist and social commentator specialising in politics, religion and low culture\". He is also features editor of the Catholic Herald. His piece begins: \"If you're worried about your finances, here's a bit of advice for you \u2013 put some money on the Conservatives losing the 2015 general election, with Labour the largest party and in power again.\" He then cites a speech by Francis Maude, as reported in the Telegraph, about the Conservatives needing to shed \"backward-looking social attitudes.\" West sees this consensual social liberalism in similar terms to the consensual economic liberalism of Ted Heath's era. He argues that the Tory leadership seems to accept most of the Left's social premises, such as the place of the family, attitude towards crime and justice and, most notably, immigration. On the latter, he writes that the Tories hold \"the prevailing liberal-Left consensus that diversity is somehow 'enriching' and 'vibrant' rather than, as most studies now show, a weakness that has to be overcome through border restrictions and official playing down of the population's differences.\" On gay marriage, West argues that \"like many Tories, I don't see it as a burning issue and don't understand the party's strategy of targeting the high-hanging fruit of metropolitan liberals, the sort of people who will never vote Conservative, while the core vote drifts off to UKIP.\" He concludes: \"Just as Heath had to go to make way for Thatcher, so the Tories losing in 2015 may well be a blessing in disguise for conservatism and Britain.\" And just to underline the Telegraph's anti-Cameron viewpoint, a second blog item, by James Delingpole, is stingingly critical of both the prime minister and the chancellor, George Osborne. His attack comes from another direction, berating the pair of public schoolboys for having \"no idea how badly this recession is treating those struggling middle class families who constitute their core vote.\" He writes: \"The Conservatives really have become the party of the spoiled, remote, arrogant rich. So much so that it makes you wonder why anyone on an income of less than \u00a3200,000 a year would even consider voting for them.\" Sources: Telegraph blogs (1) and (2)",

      "bodyText": "On Monday I wrote about Babel, the huge participatory London-wide project that is a collaboration between Wildworks and four London theatres \u2013 BAC, the Young Vic, Lyric Hammersmith and Theatre Royal Stratford East \u2013 under the World Stages banner. These four theatres are doing their own distinctive and very different kinds of work in diverse geographical and social locations across the city, but they have come together to create a show in which they all have a stake in a neutral location: Caledonian Park in north London. It's almost as if all four theatres have gone out on tour together. Each theatre is bringing its skills to bear on the project, but each is also potentially bringing its own distinct audience. There are millions of people in London and there are plenty of theatres, but research suggests that the audience crossover between subsidised theatres in the capital is much lower than you might expect: in the region of 6% was the figure BAC's David Micklem quoted to me. A project such as Babel not only furthers the co-producing conversation between theatres, but also offers opportunities to develop and encourage audiences to take a chance on something unknown or a bit different but with the involvement of a theatre whose work they already know and like. World Stages is evidence of shifts away from the old ways of thinking that saw London theatres in competition with each other, rather than allies and potential beneficiaries of each other's success. Fuel's London-wide tour of Will Adamsdale's Jackson's Way proved that you could tour successfully to venues which were only a few miles apart geographically, and by taking work to different dance houses across the capital, Hofesh Shechter has demonstrated that rather than creating a situation where each venue is fighting others for the audience, it actually helps to build a bigger audience for the work. But if a project such as Babel is built on the idea of theatres sharing on a citywide basis, how might that translate into a longer, potentially global life for the project and others like it? There is something hugely wasteful about spending 18 months on a show and then just throwing it away after a dozen or so performances. Yet there's also something that doesn't seem quite right about just saying: \"Let's take Babel around the world.\" Those old ideas of international touring, with British companies pitching their shows to overseas promoters and lots of people and kit being loaded on to planes to fly across the world to recreate the project in another city in another time zone, begin to look outmoded. After all, the British Council doesn't want to be seen as little more than a glorified international touring agency. Lead producers on Babel, BAC, are trying very hard to explore with all those theatres involved in the project how it might be possible to tour Babel abroad in ways that are ethical, responsive to the local situation on the ground and not wasteful. That means looking at ways to pack the project up in a suitcase with a detailed set of instructions that could then be taken by one or two people to Mumbai or Rio who could then create their own versions of Babel following the methodology provided. It's an idea that would only suit particular projects and it certainly won't spell an end to international touring as we currently know it, but any initiative that encourages a more responsible approach to internationalism and one that chimes with the changing times is well worth exploring.",

      "bodyText": "What kind of country would an independent Scotland be? These are some of the key numbers to the debate. It's in the news today as Severin Carrell reports: A vigorous dispute has broken out over Scottish independence after a report claimed that North Sea oil would have made Scotland better off than the rest of the UK last year \u2026 The Scottish government's annual analysis of spending and revenue showed that Scotland had a smaller deficit proportionally than the rest of the UK in 2010-11, but only if its full geographical share of North Sea oil revenues, worth nearly \u00a38.8bn last year, was included. The figures out today are from Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland 2010-2011, which breaks down spending and revenues north of the border. Whitehall says the report has shortcomings and fails to take the UK financial stability guarantees into account. And recording Scottish data is complicated: not least because of the effects of devolution. Some data is recorded at a UK level, some at a Scotland level. Some of it is referred to as 'non-identifiable' - which means that the UK Treasury can't work out how much is spent specifically in Scotland. Most of the money spent in Scotland comes from taxes raised centrally and although it does have the power to raise the basic rate of income tax by up to 3p - the government there has never used this. In 2010/11 the Scottish government calculated this would be worth \u00a31bn. The Scottish government is not able to borrow on the international markets, but can borrow short-term from the UK central government. Meanwhile, the Scottish government points out: The UK Government is able to borrow to fund public sector expenditure across the UK, including the Scottish Government block grant So what does the data say? The figures below are a mix of numbers from today's report and the Treasury. Spending per person The UK's Treasury public spending analysis does give us some regional breakdowns. The chart above shows spending per head for different parts of the UK. Under this analysis (not fully accepted by the Scottish government), Scotland receives more per person than any part of the UK, apart from Northern Ireland, which has expensive security issues. The Scottish government says this is because the public sector in Scotland still includes water and sewage; more spending on education training; a greater reliance on agriculture and public services to go with it. Plus the fact that Scottish universities (which do not have \u00a39,000 tuition fees) also have longer courses. North Sea revenues - and their effect At the moment, money raised from North Sea oil and gas revenues goes into the UK's central government pot. The Scottish government argues that geography is crucial to this and has calculated the effect of North Sea revenues based on the UK's continental shelf, so money from oil drilled in the region mapped here would be allocated to Scotland. It has a much more dramatic effect than just dividing it up among the Scottish population based on its size. Assuming a per capita share, Scotland's estimated share of total UK current revenue remains at the same level as the share assuming the exclusion of North Sea revenue, that is, 8.3 per cent in 2010-11. In contrast, under an illustrative geographical share, Scotland's estimated share of total UK current revenue increased to 9.6 per cent in the same year If you look at the figures this way, it completely changes the Scottish economy. This shows the effect on Scotland's gross domestic product: And this is the effect on public spending if you compare it with or without the 'geographic element\". Population The latest population data shows Scotland has 5.2m people - up 2.5%, compared to a 3.5% increase in England. In 13 areas, the population has either gone down or stayed static, especially Inverclyde, where it has gone down by 2.8%. Scotland has a slightly higher 'dependent population' than England - 38.2% are either over retirement age or children, compared to 37.4% of the UK. About half of Scotland's population change comes from migration, pretty similar to England. There's more data below. What can you do with it?

Whitehall says the report has shortcomings and fails to take the UK financial stability guarantees into account. </p> <p>And recording Scottish data is complicated: not least because of the effects of devolution. Some data is recorded at a UK level, some at a Scotland level. Some of it is referred to as 'non-identifiable' - which means that the UK Treasury can't work out how much is spent specifically in Scotland. </p> <p>Most of the money spent in Scotland comes from taxes raised centrally and although it does have the power to raise the basic rate of income tax by up to 3p - the government there has never used this. In 2010/11 the Scottish government calculated this would be worth \u00a31bn.</p> <p>The Scottish government is not able to borrow on the international markets, but can borrow short-term from the UK central government. Meanwhile, the Scottish government points out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK Government is able to borrow to fund public sector expenditure across the UK, including the Scottish Government block grant</p> </blockquote> <p>So what does the data say? The figures below are a mix of numbers from today's report and the Treasury.</p> <h2>Spending per person</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdEcxUUtXTmU4WkFqTUJpYXdXTERYblE&transpose=1&headers=1&range=A1%3AF5&gid=3&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"vAxes\":[{\"title\":\"\\u00a3 per person\",\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null},{\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}}],\"series\":{\"3\":{\"pointSize\":2,\"color\":\"#666666\"},\"2\":{\"pointSize\":2,\"color\":\"#999999\"},\"1\":{\"pointSize\":7},\"0\":{\"color\":\"#3d85c6\",\"pointSize\":7}},\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"curveType\":\"\",\"title\":\"Spending on services\",\"legendTextStyle\":{\"fontSize\":\"10\"},\"animation\":{\"duration\":500},\"legend\":\"bottom\",\"vAxis\":{\"format\":\"\"},\"lineWidth\":2,\"hAxis\":{\"titleFontSize\":\"8\",\"title\":\"SOURCE: PESA\",\"format\":\"\"},\"width\":460,\"height\":276},\"state\":{},\"chartType\":\"LineChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart1\"} </script> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pespub_index.htm\">UK's Treasury public spending analysis</a> does give us some regional breakdowns. The chart above shows spending per head for different parts of the UK. Under this analysis (not fully accepted by the Scottish government), Scotland receives more per person than any part of the UK, apart from Northern Ireland, which has expensive security issues.</p> <p>The Scottish government says this is because the public sector in Scotland still includes water and sewage; more spending on education training; a greater reliance on agriculture and public services to go with it. Plus the fact that Scottish universities (which do not have \u00a39,000 tuition fees) also have longer courses.</p> <h2>North Sea revenues - and their effect</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdEcxUUtXTmU4WkFqTUJpYXdXTERYblE&transpose=0&headers=1&range=A46%3AB77&gid=2&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"vAxes\":[{\"title\":\"\\u00a3m\",\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null},{\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}}],\"series\":{\"0\":{\"color\":\"#134f5c\"}},\"title\":\"North sea revenue, UK\",\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"animation\":{\"duration\":500},\"legend\":\"none\",\"vAxis\":{\"format\":\"\"},\"hAxis\":{\"format\":\"\"},\"isStacked\":false,\"width\":460,\"height\":276},\"state\":{},\"chartType\":\"ColumnChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart3\"} </script> </figure>  <p>At the moment, money raised from North Sea oil and gas revenues goes into the UK's central government pot. The Scottish government argues that geography is crucial to this and has calculated the effect of North Sea revenues based on the UK's continental shelf, so money from oil drilled in the region <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/06/21144516/7#f51\">mapped here</a> would be allocated to Scotland. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdEcxUUtXTmU4WkFqTUJpYXdXTERYblE&transpose=1&headers=1&range=A20%3AF23&gid=3&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"vAxes\":[{\"title\":\"\\u00a3m\",\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null},{\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}}],\"series\":{\"2\":{\"color\":\"#3d85c6\"},\"1\":{\"color\":\"#cc0000\"},\"0\":{\"color\":\"#073763\"}},\"title\":\"Which is Scotland's fair share?\",\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"legendTextStyle\":{\"fontSize\":\"10\"},\"animation\":{\"duration\":500},\"legend\":\"right\",\"vAxis\":{\"format\":\"\"},\"hAxis\":{\"format\":\"\"},\"isStacked\":false,\"width\":460,\"height\":276},\"state\":{},\"chartType\":\"ColumnChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart4\"} </script> </figure>  <p>It has a much more dramatic effect than just dividing it up among the Scottish population based on its size. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Assuming a per capita share, Scotland's estimated share of total UK current revenue remains at the same level as the share assuming the exclusion of North Sea revenue, that is, 8.3 per cent in 2010-11. In contrast, under an illustrative geographical share, Scotland's estimated share of total UK current revenue increased to 9.6 per cent in the same year</p> </blockquote> <p>If you look at the figures this way, it completely changes the Scottish economy.

The UTV-owned station will position itself as the only full-time sport station in the UK, putting further clear water between its rival, BBC Radio 5 Live. TalkSport programme director, Moz Dee, said it was an \"exciting yet natural next step\" for the station which rebranded as TalkSport from its original incarnation, Talk Radio, 12 years ago. In total 39 hours a week of non-sports programming will go, including the three-hour The Week with George Galloway show on Friday nights. Galloway, who presented his first show on the station in 2006 not long after he did a memorable impression of a cat on Celebrity Big Brother, has said he will stand as an MP in the Bradford West byelection. The weeknight overnight show presenter, Mike Graham, on air between 1am and 6am, will remain, but from now the show \u2013 billed as \"some good old-fashioned late-night debate\" \u2013 will focus entirely on sport. TalkSport's weekend overnight presenter Matt Forde is staying with the station, but Steve Berry is leaving. \"We want to change expectations of overnight radio, focusing on up-to-the-minute sport news and information from around the globe,\" said Dee. \"It gives us a great opportunity to work with an international network of sports reporters covering everything from American sports to British teams and athletes competing on the other side of the world, and makes us the only UK station focused on sport all of the time.\" The change will see TalkSport cover more US sports overnight, including basketball, baseball and American football. TalkSport, which won national station of the year at last year's Sony Radio Academy Awards, has an average weekly audience of 3.2 million listeners a week. The Sports Bar will go five nights a week from this Friday, with the overnight programming switching to sport from 2 April. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Such was the dilemma faced by some staunch republicans yesterday, when they clapped eyes upon the kind of adorable photos of Prince Harry gambolling down a racetrack with Usain Bolt in Jamaica. While not a passionate Harry-fancier myself, my heart did go out to those who suffered the painful cognitive dissonance of their anti-royalist sensibilities being threatened by his sporting exploits. Similarly, I can't help sympathising with those who find themselves regarding a photo of Prince William in a suit and thinking: \"I deeply resent paying for that impeccably tailored, expensive suit with my taxes, but I am also distressed to realise that I think he looks quite dapper in it.\" And I can understand, too, the pain of seeing the Duchess of Cambridge on television and noting \u2013 despite your best intentions, your commitment to democracy, your belief that the monarchy is a shameful anachronism \u2013 that she has extraordinarily pretty hair. Why do I think these lovesick souls deserve sympathy? Because fancying someone who represents everything you don't stand for is a classic form of love; one of the most painful and compelling. In drama, it's a great source of narrative frisson to have someone's only love spring from their only hate. But in real life, it can be pretty awkward when you realise that your feelings about the royal family are driven in part by strange romantic urges that make you hate yourself. What's at the root of these terrible crushes? Maybe it's an adolescent impulse. As awkward young teenagers in the playground, we learn that the correct response to fancying someone is to make a great fuss about how much you dislike them until they hate you back with an equal passion. In adults, this process seems to manifest in the wrong order. We decide that we have an intense dislike for someone and then we find ourselves attracted to them, as if we've come to understand that animosity is a cause of love, rather than a clever disguise for it. In cases where we have our heads involuntarily turned by the royal family, I wonder if it goes back even further: to our earliest understandings of romance. Strangely, my strong feminist values don't mean that I've forgotten what it was like to understand that marriage to a prince is an elegant and comfortable solution to the challenges of being a woman, thanks to the fairy tales that I read as a child. Pangs of this understanding can arise when you least expect or desire them. Like the horrifying moment when you've gone to France to escape the royal wedding, only to find yourself thinking: \"Well, there's one more career option closed to me forever,\" while watching it live on a television in a gloomy Parisian tabagie. Look, there's no reason to be ashamed if you are a prince-loving republican. Well, maybe there is a bit of reason to be ashamed. But not to self-flagellate. Be kind to yourself. The torture of fancying someone who you think that you also (should) hate is not going to be alleviated by self-loathing. You don't need double the misery. Instead, why not redirect your undesirable desire towards a cause that combats it? Not only will marching on the front lines of pro-republicanism serve as a most convincing cover for your royal crush: it will also give you a simple, easy justification for thinking about them all the time. And \"researching\" them, with the help of Google image search. For the cause. Knowing your enemy has never been so hot. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

Like the horrifying moment when you've gone to France to escape the royal wedding, only to find yourself thinking: \"Well, there's one more career option closed to me forever,\" while watching it live on a television in a gloomy Parisian tabagie.</p> <p>Look, there's no reason to be ashamed if you are a prince-loving republican. Well, maybe there is a bit of reason to be ashamed. But not to self-flagellate. Be kind to yourself. The torture of fancying someone who you think that you also (should) hate is not going to be alleviated by self-loathing. You don't need double the misery.</p> <p>Instead, why not redirect your undesirable desire towards a cause that combats it? Not only will marching on the front lines of pro-republicanism serve as a most convincing cover for your royal crush: it will also give you a simple, easy justification for thinking about them all the time. And \"researching\" them, with the help of Google image search. For the cause. Knowing your enemy has never been so hot.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>",

The Dominica-born Rhys moved from Paris to London in 1928 following her affair with Ford and the breakdown of her first marriage. She married her agent, Leslie Tilden Smith, in 1934, and they moved to Flat 22 in Paultons House in 1936, living there for two years. Rhys wrote her acclaimed novel Good Morning, Midnight \u2013 the story of a young woman in 1930s Paris \u2013 in the Chelsea apartment, spending her mornings in a bed \"strewn with pages\". Wide Sargasso Sea, her response to Jane Eyre in which she imagined the Caribbean upbringing of Mr Rochester's first wife, was not written until 1960, when Rhys was living in the village of Cheriton Fitzpaine in Devon. A plaque commemorating the celebrated novelist Elizabeth Bowen was also installed yesterday at 2 Clarence Terrace, Regents Park. Bowen wrote some of her best-loved works, The Death of the Heart and The Heat of the Day, while at Clarence Terrace, her home for 17 years until 1952. Both authors, said blue plaques historian Dr Susan Skedd, \"drew on their personal experiences during their time in London to create the stories and fictional worlds inhabited by their characters\", with Bowen writing \"one of the most compelling portraits of life in London during the Blitz\" in The Heat of the Day. Former poet laureate Andrew Motion said that both Rhys and Bowen \"made invaluable and unforgettable contributions to writing\", and that \"in honouring them, the blue plaques scheme does honour to itself\". English Heritage chair, Baroness Andrews, described Rhys and Bowen as \"two of our most important female writers\". \"Although different in many ways, each voice was distinct as they drew on their own experiences to create their work,\" she said. \"Each made a vivid mark on literature, and they have left us with a great legacy.\"",

A total of 20,000 places have been stripped from higher education institutions in England and auctioned off to universities and colleges charging average tuition fees of \u00a37,500 or less this year. About 9,600 have gone to 35 universities, of which the biggest winners were Anglia Ruskin, London Met, Nottingham Trent and Staffordshire. But more than half of the places have gone to further education colleges, including Hartpury College in Gloucester, Newham College, east London, and Newcastle College. Universities can charge tuition fees of up to \u00a39,000 from this September. The creation of a margin of 20,000 student places open only to cheaper institutions was intended to create pressure to bring fees down. In December, 24 universities and one FE college brought down their average fees in order to bid for student places from the margin. Announcing the reforms last year, the universities minister, David Willetts, said there would be \"pressure for quality and value for money\" on universities. Nick Davy, higher education policy manager with the Association of Colleges, said: \"The quality of college bids through the core and margin system has led to an allocation of around 10,500 additional full-time student numbers for the sector \u2013 an increase of 25% on present numbers.\" However, Davy said a number of universities had also withdrawn undergraduate places they had previously extended on a franchise basis to local FE colleges. He said: \"This figure is brought down substantially by the practice of universities withdrawing indirect student numbers from the sector. AoC estimates that the growth in entrant numbers actually is nearer to 7%, a long way from the government's intention to significantly support degree-level growth in the college sector. \"There needs to be a considerable increase in margin places to achieve the government aim of creating a more cost-effective and accessible HE sector.\" The coalition's higher education reforms also allow institutions to expand to take on more students who achieve grades AAB or higher at A-level. The government estimates this will cover about 65,000 students in this summer's exam season. This is expected mainly to benefit elite universities.",

The treasury sold just 8bn roubles (\u00a3170m) of a planned 45bn roubles worth of seven-year bonds at the auction on Wednesday. Putin won the presidency with almost 64% of the vote but independent election monitors and opposition activists contested the result, offering evidence of widespread falsifications. The news prompted opposition protests, with 20,000 people gathering in Moscow's Pushkin Square on Monday for an anti-Putin rally. Investors dismissed suggestions that poor demand for the bonds was linked to the election result. Jerome Booth, head of research at emerging markets debt investors Ashmore, said rouble bond auctions tend to attract Russian investors, who have two days off at the end of this week for International Women's Day. \"The holidays are coming up,\" he said. \"There's low liquidity because they are not there, they've gone off for the weekend. It's not to do with politics. The next one will probably be fine.\" The Russian bond market has had a strong run this year and some analysts said the government had aimed too high with the price guidance for this auction. Manik Narain, emerging markets strategist at UBS, said: \"Investors are becoming a bit more choosy about the levels at which they buy Russian bonds.\" A weaker rouble may also have spooked investors. The currency slipped 3% against the dollar in the past seven trading days. Narain added: \"We're not very worried at this point. Certainly the election result was very rightly disputed. Will this lead to a breakdown in confidence in the markets? I really don't think so.\"",

Sometimes you want to replicate at home a dish that you have eaten out, only without the work, and using precooked beetroot is a good cheat. But make sure you use a good-quality red wine vinegar for your acidity. (Serves four as a starter, two as a main) 200g beetroot, precooked 25ml red wine vinegar 125ml olive oil 1 tsp Dijon mustard 1 medium red onion, sliced 2 rib-eye steaks of around 200g each A few good handfuls of rocket 2 tsp fresh horseradish, grated Cut the beetroot into large cubes and place in a bowl. Prepare the vinaigrette by mixing the red wine vinegar, olive oil and mustard. Add the sliced red onion to the vinaigrette so its starts to marinate. Season the rib-eye, then, in a hot griddle-pan (or if you don't have one, you can use a frying pan), cook on either side for two minutes, depending on the thickness of the steak. When ready, remove from the pan, allow to rest for three minutes, then cut against the grain (although this isn't so essential with rib-eye steak because it is tender), on a slight diagonal, about 1cm thick. Put the steak and rocket into the bowl with the beetroot, mix and pour over the vinaigrette and onion. Serve on a plate, finished with the freshly grated horseradish. \u2022 Angela Hartnett is chef patron at Murano restaurant and consults at the Whitechapel Gallery and Dining Room, London. twitter.com/angela hartnett",

Sometimes you want to replicate at home a dish that you have eaten out, only without the work, and using precooked beetroot is a good cheat. But make sure you use a good-quality red wine vinegar for your acidity.</p> <p><strong>(S<em>erves four as a starter, two as a main)</em></strong><br><strong>200g beetroot, precooked</strong><br><strong>25ml red wine vinegar</strong><br><strong>125ml olive oil</strong><br><strong>1 tsp Dijon mustard</strong><br><strong>1 medium red onion, sliced</strong><br><strong>2 rib-eye steaks of around 200g each</strong><br><strong>A few good handfuls of rocket</strong><br><strong>2 tsp fresh horseradish, grated</strong></p> <p>Cut the beetroot into large cubes and place in a bowl.</p> <p>Prepare the vinaigrette by mixing the red wine vinegar, olive oil and mustard. Add the sliced red onion to the vinaigrette so its starts to marinate.</p> <p>Season the rib-eye, then, in a hot griddle-pan (or if you don't have one, you can use a frying pan), cook on either side for two minutes, depending on the thickness of the steak.</p> <p>When ready, remove from the pan, allow to rest for three minutes, then cut against the grain (although this isn't so essential with rib-eye steak because it is tender), on a slight diagonal, about 1cm thick.</p> <p>Put the steak and rocket into the bowl with the beetroot, mix and pour over the vinaigrette and onion. Serve on a plate, finished with the freshly grated horseradish.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Angela Hartnett is chef patron at Murano restaurant and consults at the Whitechapel Gallery and Dining Room, London. </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/angelahartnett\" title=\"\"><em>twitter.com/angela hartnett</em></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Here we go again. As if all the ratings hoo-hah between The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing last year wasn't enough, ITV and the BBC have lined up another piddling contest. The BBC is likely to unveil its new singing contest, The Voice, on Saturday 24 March \u2013 which is also apparently set to be the day Britain's Got Talent returns to screens. This doesn't just mean that we're all in for another bombardment of BBC v ITV stories. It also means that we'll have to choose which one to watch live. So which will it be? ITV's proven ratings winner or the BBC's plucky young upstart? Let's break down both shows to see who'll come out on top. The format Britain's Got Talent: Originally starting life as America's Got Talent, BGT is an old-school talent show that seeks to uncover the best this country has to offer \u2013 from dancing dogs to father and son combos who remove their tops and run around to Irish fiddle music. Historically, the show favours dancers and pseudo-classical singers who you feel slightly sorry for. The Voice: Originally a Dutch show, its gimmick is that the judges can't actually see the contestants. Because it's all about the voice, you see. That and the look on the judges' faces when they spin their chairs around and realise that their favoured act is actually a bit funny-looking. Later the acts go head to head in a battle round, then there are some X Factor-style live episodes, and then we can all go home. The hosts Britain's Got Talent: Ant and Dec. A safe pair of hands. The viewers love them in everything they've ever done, provided that you're willing to overlook Red Or Black?, Alien Autopsy, PokerFace, Push the Button and a large percentage of their singing career. Like them or not, you have to admit that they're as much a part of BGT as crying children and creepy bellringers. The Voice: Holly Willoughby and Reggie Yates. While they don't have the same inseparable partnership as Ant and Dec, they've still got a lot going for them. They've both racked up hours of live television with the likes of This Morning, Dancing on Ice and Smile. Plus they're quite a lot easier to tell apart than Ant and Dec. What more could you ask for? The judges Britain's Got Talent: Amanda Holden, who everyone loves because of her recent childbirth traumas. David Walliams, who everyone loves because he swam up the Thames for charity. Simon Cowell, who everyone loves because they tend not to watch any of his shows unless he's a judge. And Alesha Dixon. The Voice: will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas. A slightly confused-looking Tom Jones. A painfully anonymous member of what's basically a jumped-up boyband. And Jessie J, who's presumably taking part because she just wants to make the world dance, and not because it's easy money or anything. The prize Britain's Got Talent: Simon Cowell is determined to show that he means business this year. The winner will still perform in front of royalty, but the cash prize has been increased from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3500,000. And Cowell has promised to literally blast the winner into space to perform. Fingers crossed that a dog finally wins this year. The Voice: A recording contract with Universal. Possibly some money. An unspoken understanding that the winner will get at least five minutes of glory before people start making David Sneddon jokes. And that's everything you need to know about each contender. Britain's Got Talent is a ratings juggernaut, but it seems to be on the wane. The Voice is generating a lot of excitement, but shows such as Fame Academy and DanceX have proved that the BBC tends to be uniformly awful at shows like this. Plus, not to sway your vote one way or the other, I'll be liveblogging the first episode of The Voice on 24 March. So which one will you watch \u2013 Britain's Got Talent or The Voice?

      "bodyText": "David Cameron was forced to defend plans to make parents work longer hours to be eligible for tax credits and means-test child benefit amid accusations from the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, that he had reneged on promises made before the general election. Cameron defended the changes as being part of a bigger picture in which there was a need to reduce the \"massive\" deficit. \"Life is about difficult decisions; government is about difficult decisions,\" said the prime minister. Cameron was also angered by a separate question put to him by Labour MP Joan Ruddock about disability benefits. She asked him \"to look me in the eye\" and tell her if he was truly proud of changes that will see disability benefits withdrawn from a 10-year-old girl \"who can hardly walk and who cannot toilet herself because she has cerebral palsy?\" The Labour attack on benefit reforms began with Miliband highlighting the new eligibility criteria for tax credits due to come into force next month. The Labour leader cited the example of a married delivery driver with three children from Dartford in Kent who currently works 20 hours a week but who from next month will lose his entire working tax credit, worth \u00a360 a week, unless he can work an additional four hours a week. Miliband said the father of three had approached his employer about increasing his hours, but was told this \"there simply aren't the hours there\" and the wife was unable to find work consistent with caring for her three school-aged children. \"He's going to lose as a result of this,\" he said. The prime minister said he did not think it was unreasonable to increase the weekly hours requirement to qualify from 16 to 24 hours for couples. \"We are dealing with a basic unfairness where we ask a single parent to work 16 hours before getting access to the tax credit system, so it's only right to say to couples that between them they should work 24 hours \u2013 ie 12 hours each. If they do that they will be better off.\" Miliband taunted Cameron with comments made in the runup to the May 2010 general election, when the Tory leader denied that his party's plans to reform tax credits would hit low-income families. \"Why have you broken that promise?\" asked the Labour leader. Cameron cited the budget deficit for the need to revamp the system and denied the change was unreasonable. The Labour leader said many families unable to find extra work would be better off on benefits, adding: \"It goes to this matter of trust. The prime minister made a clear promise.\" He turned to another \"clear promise\", namely the plan to cut child benefit for high earners. The controversial proposal will mean that two parents each earning about \u00a340,000 \u2013 with a combined household income of \u00a380,000 \u2013 can continue to receive the cash, while a single parent on \u00a343,000 would be stripped of the handout. Miliband said: \"We have already established you've broken your promise to low income families; why have you broken your promise to middle income families too?\" Cameron fired back that the Labour leader was ducking difficult decisions. \"Do you really think people earning \u00a320,000, \u00a325,000 should pay for your child benefit? I don't agree with that. We have to make savings so not giving child benefit to the wealthiest 15% of families in our country \u2013 of course it is a difficult decision. Life is about difficult decisions, government is about difficult decisions.\" Miliband said it was no good saying people on high earnings shouldn't get child benefit when he said \"quite clearly\" before the general election he wouldn't take child benefit away. \"Low income families are losing their tax credits, middle income families are losing their child benefit. Does the prime minister understand why people just don't believe him when he says we are all in this together?\" Cameron said reducing the deficit meant \"tough decisions\", as Miliband's own shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, had acknowledged when she said the party must \"pass the test of fiscal credibility\". Yet Miliband had opposed \"every single cut\". But Cameron faced a further attack when Joan Ruddock, the Labour MP for Lewisham Deptford, attacked him for the way welfare reforms were affected people with cerebral palsy. She asked him: \"Can you look me in the eye and tell me you're proud of the decision to remove all disability benefits from a 10-year-old child who can hardly walk and who cannot toilet herself because she has cerebral palsy? Are you truly proud?\" Cameron, whose severely disabled son Ivan had the condition and died in February 2009 aged six, denied the government was axing disability benefits. The government is scrapping disability living allowance and replacing it with personal independence payments, granted after medical checks. The PM added: \"As someone who has actually filled out the form for disability living allowance and had a child with cerebral palsy, I know how long it takes to fill in that form. We are going to have a proper medical test so people who are disabled, who need that help, get it more quickly.\"",

      "bodyText": "Of all the Arsenal players taking in the strangely sweet and sour emotions of an elimination after a 3-0 triumph, the one who looked the most crestfallen was Tomas Rosicky, who lay prone on the pitch at the end of it all as if clobbered by a heavyweight's uppercut. The Czech midfielder had put in a particularly inspiring performance. Such was the calibre of his play, once the Arsenal supporters had stopped applauding they were left ruminating the question: where has this little maestro been hiding all these years? In the past month Rosicky has upped his game to the levels that made him such an exciting signing from Borussia Dortmund when Ars\u00e8ne Wenger did his business nice and early in the summer of 2006, and sealed the deal before the World Cup began in Germany. Rosicky scored two peaches against the USA during that tournament, cementing his reputation as a refined talent. His first season in England was promising enough, but then his career hit the buffers. The nickname \"Rosick-note\" sums up a period so bleak there was genuine concern about if, rather than when, he would return. The entire 2008-09 season was wiped out. He did not play a single minute of football. There were whispers that the injury had been misdiagnosed. Others suggested nobody knew how to get to the bottom of it. Whenever Wenger was quizzed about what was wrong or asked for an estimated date for a comeback, the manager was ambivalent. He even referred to it as a \"mystery\" injury. It seemed everybody was baffled. In fairness, this kind of obscure extended injury has become worryingly familiar at Arsenal, with Jack Wilshere, Abou Diaby and Thomas Vermaelen all suffering lengthy spells out that seem difficult to explain. Cesc F\u00e1bregas, Rosicky's best friend when they were both at Arsenal, was one of his biggest supporters. \"I have spent a lot of time with him and I know how he feels,\" F\u00e1bregas said when Rosicky was on the long road back to playing football. \"I know what he wants and I have never seen a guy being so committed, so professional and never giving up. If this happened to me I probably wouldn't want to talk to anyone, I would be always down and angry. But he's unbelievable. \"He's the type of player you enjoy playing alongside and as a guy he's amazing. He has been through a lot. I told him to be strong and to keep believing in himself and that he could play football again.\" The journey back to the peak of his game has not been easy, though. Through a combination of niggly injuries and struggles to rediscover his rhythm, Rosicky has never started more than 20 games in a season since he came back from his year out. Establishing himself as a guaranteed pick for the first XI has been challenging. But recent displays have put him to the forefront of Wenger's plans. Most interestingly, in his outstanding displays in Arsenal's past three home games against Blackburn, Tottenham and Milan (won with an aggregate scoreline of 15-3) he has played in his preferred position, as a central schemer. He has always been a classical playmaker. But rather like Andrey Arshavin, he suffered from Wenger's desire to position players who arrive at the club as an authentic No10 out wide. Neither of them \u2013 both experienced internationals who are trusted by their countries to dictate the game from the middle \u2013 ever looked at their happiest on the flank. For much of this campaign Wenger has preferred Aaron Ramsey in the playmaker role. But it is, as far as Rosicky is concerned, a twist of fate that has allowed him to move into the attacking midfield heartland with the young Welshman injured (and looking burned out to boot). Rosicky got this chance to shine, and he has grabbed it. His dribbling and darting across the pitch against Milan rolled back the years. He looked liberated. It was a great team performance, but he was definitely the one who gave Arsenal the impulse to make a game of it. Robin van Persie defines it as Rosicky being \"football clever\" and the captain is a nother big admirer. \"I just love playing with him because he's so quick in his mind. That's something you can't pick up later in your career. You either have it or you don't.\" The \"Little Mozart\" moniker, one that had not felt particularly appropriate for much of his five-year spell in England, suddenly feels fitting again. Some cynics noted that Rosicky's return to his best coincides conveniently with the time contract renewals come to the fore. A kinder view is that an injury-free player positioned in his most suitable role has made everything click again. Now aged 31, Rosicky has no more time to lose.",

Cesc F\u00e1bregas, Rosicky's best friend when they were both at Arsenal, was one of his biggest supporters. \"I have spent a lot of time with him and I know how he feels,\" F\u00e1bregas said when Rosicky was on the long road back to playing football. \"I know what he wants and I have never seen a guy being so committed, so professional and never giving up. If this happened to me I probably wouldn't want to talk to anyone, I would be always down and angry. But he's unbelievable.</p> <p>\"He's the type of player you enjoy playing alongside and as a guy he's amazing. He has been through a lot. I told him to be strong and to keep believing in himself and that he could play football again.\"</p> <p>The journey back to the peak of his game has not been easy, though. Through a combination of niggly injuries and struggles to rediscover his rhythm, Rosicky has never started more than 20 games in a season since he came back from his year out. Establishing himself as a guaranteed pick for the first XI has been challenging.</p> <p>But recent displays have put him to the forefront of Wenger's plans. Most interestingly, in his outstanding displays in Arsenal's past three home games against Blackburn, Tottenham and Milan (won with an aggregate scoreline of 15-3) he has played in his preferred position, as a central schemer.</p> <p>He has always been a classical playmaker. But rather like Andrey Arshavin, he suffered from Wenger's desire to position players who arrive at the club as an authentic No10 out wide. Neither of them \u2013 both experienced internationals who are trusted by their countries to dictate the game from the middle \u2013 ever looked at their happiest on the flank.</p> <p>For much of this campaign Wenger has preferred Aaron Ramsey in the playmaker role. But it is, as far as Rosicky is concerned, a twist of fate that has allowed him to move into the attacking midfield heartland with the young Welshman injured (and looking burned out to boot). Rosicky got this chance to shine, and he has grabbed it. His dribbling and darting across the pitch against Milan rolled back the years. He looked liberated. It was a great team performance, but he was definitely the one who gave Arsenal the impulse to make a game of it.</p> <p>Robin van Persie defines it as Rosicky being \"football clever\" and the captain is a nother big admirer. \"I just love playing with him because he's so quick in his mind. That's something you can't pick up later in your career. You either have it or you don't.\"</p> <p>The \"Little Mozart\" moniker, one that had not felt particularly appropriate for much of his five-year spell in England, suddenly feels fitting again. Some cynics noted that Rosicky's return to his best coincides conveniently with the time contract renewals come to the fore. A kinder view is that an injury-free player positioned in his most suitable role has made everything click again. Now aged 31, Rosicky has no more time to lose.</p>",

Seeing this may be enough to reassure you \u2013 but you would be well-advised to check the credit licence register before you make any assumptions. The register lists any actions that may have been taken against a lender, and in some cases you may find the Office of Fair Trading is in the process of trying to take away its licence. As a report by the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee reveals, it can take years for a lender to lose its licence after the OFT is satisfied it has broken enough rules that it no longer deserves one. When the OFT does put on a \"minded to revoke\" notice, it is not allowed to publicise it \u2013 there are no press releases drawing attention to what it has done. You will only see it if you check the register, or keep an eye on the section of its website dedicated to credit enforcement action. Once the OFT makes its decision, the company is given time to appeal, time during which it is allowed to trade as before. It isn't obliged to tell consumers that its licence is under threat, so anyone taking out a loan during that time has no extra protection. Currently there are several payday loan firms on the list, including Yes Loans and MCO Capital, which operate as Paycheckcredit, Popcredit and Speedcredit, which are allowed to offer loans to borrowers, despite causing concerns to the regulator. The OFT is currently investigating the market \u2013 it says if companies are found to be preying on vulnerable borrowers they could face sanctions. Ultimately this may be good news, but they could still trade, and make money, for several more months after the OFT takes action. The regulator's hands are tied. In October, the OFT's head of credit enforcement Nigel Cates told my colleague Jill Insley of the frustrations of deciding to revoke a licence, then watching as a firm that knows it will be closing doing everything it can to maximise profits. \"It would be helpful to be able to suspend a company's licence immediately when we have evidence of serious misconduct and we need to protect consumers,\" he says. Vivienne Dews, executive director of the OFT's Credit Group, told the committee: \"If we were looking at how we could increase our powers, that would be top of our list. It has been discussed with governments in the past. I do not think there is any debate about whether it would be a useful thing to do; there has not been an opportunity to give us that power, but there is no real debate about it.\" The committee has called for a fast-track procedure introduced to suspend credit licences where businesses have failed to adhere to the rules. It seems to me that this should be a priority if the government wants to clean up the market.

      "bodyText": "This month, a new campaign, Move Your Money, is running to persuade consumers that it is time to ditch the big bad banks and switch to something better. It is an old adage in banking that people stay longer with their bank than they do in their marriage. Divorce rates are now going up again in the UK, perhaps because times are harder, but switching banks remains stubbornly low. Almost half of all consumers say they have never even considered switching. The UK has among the lowest switching rates in Europe, at around half the level of countries such as Spain. A mere 6% switch their current account in any one year. This is around a quarter of the switching rates for phones and energy. Most people who do switch, according to research, only do so because they have a bad experience with their current bank, rather than wanting something better. It is no wonder that the Office of Fair Trading has concluded that the established banks do not even bother to compete on price. Instead you get lush advertising, such as Lloyds' sweet cartoon characters, designed to do nothing more than reassure you that your bank is not really reckless or profiteering. The cartoon characters, though, are just cartoons. Since 2008 we have been plunged into the worst recession in living memory, which has been the direct result of a financial crisis caused by the reckless gambling of an irresponsible cartel of banks that were too big to fail. In the UK, taxpayer bailouts for the banks, leaving aside the eventual bill for quantitative easing, has cost at least \u00a31.2tn, equivalent to 85% of GDP \u2013 the highest level of any comparable economy. And it is not over yet. In the context of the Euro crisis, the banking system is borrowing as much or more than it is lending. While the public sector cuts, in local services, schools and hospitals, are being made because of the bailout bill and the knock-on impact on the economy, banks across Europe are still being propped up indirectly by the state. Monthly borrowing by banks has been running at a rate that is equivalent to a quarter of what we spend every year on education. It is no wonder that Peter Sands, chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, has warned in recent days that the current approach is \"laying the seeds for the next crisis\". But it is not as if the new welfare state for banks means that they treat customers with care and consideration. There has been a trickle of financial scandals over recent decades, tracked by journalists, consumer campaigners and, in most cases, eventually the regulators. There is no current overarching estimate for consumer detriment in financial services. The Office of Fair Trading has published figures for consumer detriment across the economy of \u00a36.6bn pa, and demonstrated in this that professional and financial services generated 46% of total financial loss. However, these figures are only for visible detriment that consumers are aware of as incidences of problems that they can complain about. They do not cover hidden detriments, which are prevalent in the consumer experience of financial services, both for reasons of complexity and because it can take considerable time for losses to become apparent. Working with the Financial Inclusion Centre, I have estimated the total costs to be around \u00a332bn over five years \u2013 money that comes out of consumers' pockets. It is something of a relief then to see that sanity is beginning to break out in the form of a new campaign, Move Your Money. March is set as Move Your Money Month and a simple and elegant campaign website allows us to pledge to move our account to something better. There is no shortage of options when it comes to co-operative and mutual banking; credit unions, building societies and the Co-operative Bank. The big banks operate in the interests of their shareholders, not their customers. It is always in the interests of the banks to use depositors' money in ways that are more risky than their customers would want. Because co-operative and mutual banks are not owned by external shareholders, they can put the interests of their customers first. Their money is reinvested locally rather than going into the global carousel of bonuses and high finance. If you switch banks to an ethical bank, your money is being used for good \u2013 so it is not just fair to you but fair to others. Independent research shows that the switching process is far smoother than people may fear. You ask the new bank to set in train and all your standing orders and arrangements should be transferred and up and running within 10 days of the application being approved. If you want to switch your ISA account (and it is a good month to do this), then it is 15 days. For many years, current accounts have been a cash cow for the big banks. One way or another, often through hidden charges and low or zero interest, they make \u00a3152 out of every bank account they have. This is more than they earn from savings and credit cards put together. We get the banks that we deserve. If you are not wedded to your bank, or if you are affected by the cuts and economic uncertainty that they have contributed to, then you can join with others and send a simple message in language they will understand.

      "bodyText": "You spend a billion dollars on airline security, and then the terrorists just go and beat it by stitching a bomb in their side pocket \u2013 at least according to one blogger, who has filmed himself defeating the hated \"nude\" body scanners at two American airports. Well, kind of. What engineer Jon Corbett has certainly done is tapped into a wellstream of anger at the invasive nature of modern airport security, as laid down by the Transportation Security Administration, whose scans and patdowns come at some cost to passenger dignity. Health concerns over the back-scatter x-ray technology used in roughly half the scanners (as opposed to millimetre-wave machines) have also led the EU to put a moratorium on implementation in Europe, although most studies have dismissed any risk. On his blog, TSA Out of Our Pants, Corbett enterprisingly demonstrates how he passed through scanners unchallenged at airports in Fort Lauderdale and Cleveland because, he claims, the dark shadow the object throws up on a scan is identical to the background. Israel's famously secure Ben-Gurion airport, he points out, has decided the machines aren't worth it. America's TSA is, he concludes, \"an epic fail\". What do the experts say? Yes and no. The only place such scanners are in use this side of the Atlantic is Manchester airport, where any passenger who alarms the metal detector is put through the body scanner. The airport says it is quicker and cheaper than the alternative of frisking. Of Corbett's experiment, spokesman Russell Craig said: \"He's taken a small metal tin through. And the guards are looking for a threat object. That's not one. It's not a valid test. To say this shows it undermines airport security technology is totally wrong.\" Aviation security expert Philip Baum, of Green Light, says: \"Pretty much every system, you can fool.\" He says that scanners use avatars \u2013 not the kind of images Corbett has put up on his blog \u2013 so talk of \"nude\" scanners is unnecessarily sensational. But he has some sympathy with the idea that scanners are a colossal waste of money. \"Using advanced imaging technology has its benefit,\" he says, \"providing you know what you're looking for. You need 67 machines to do the job of 20 metal detectors. So it's certainly not cost-effective \u2013 and it's questionable if it's effective in any case. You can't pick up internal carry \u2013 which is what drug smugglers do every day. And there is no technology currently screening people for explosives.\" But he warns that traditional archway metal detectors have very little benefit apart from the deterrent effect. Instead, he proposes a focused search \u2013 profiling passengers. Globally, airlines are keen to speed up and streamline security, a massively expensive, time-consuming and unpopular hassle. Currently under consideration by the international body Iata is the \"checkpoint of the future\" programme, which would divide travellers into known, trusted and others \u2013 giving some more likelihood of the unpleasantly intimate experiences readers of Corbett's blog recount in the comments. But only at the cost of providing ever more information \u2013 another civil liberties concern. And, Baum says, even the trusted traveller can turn \u2013 if threatened or drugged. For airline passengers, especially perhaps the mildly more irradiated American ones, the days of having a security regime that, as Corbett puts it, \"molests our families\" are a long way from over.",

      "body": "<p>You spend a billion dollars on airline security, and then the terrorists just go and beat it by stitching a bomb in their side pocket \u2013 at least according to one blogger, who has filmed himself defeating the hated \"nude\" body scanners at two American airports.</p> <p>Well, kind of. What engineer Jon Corbett has certainly done is tapped into a wellstream of anger at the invasive nature of modern airport security, as laid down by the Transportation Security Administration, whose scans and patdowns come at some cost to passenger dignity. Health concerns over the back-scatter x-ray technology used in roughly half the scanners (as opposed to millimetre-wave machines) have also led the EU to put a moratorium on implementation in Europe, although most studies have dismissed any risk.</p> <p>On his blog, TSA Out of Our Pants, Corbett enterprisingly demonstrates how he passed through scanners unchallenged at airports in Fort Lauderdale and Cleveland because, he claims, the dark shadow the object throws up on a scan is identical to the background.</p> <p>Israel's famously secure Ben-Gurion airport, he points out, has decided the machines aren't worth it. America's TSA is, he concludes, \"an epic fail\".</p> <p>What do the experts say? Yes and no. The only place such scanners are in use this side of the Atlantic is Manchester airport, where any passenger who alarms the metal detector is put through the body scanner. The airport says it is quicker and cheaper than the alternative of frisking. Of Corbett's experiment, spokesman Russell Craig said: \"He's taken a small metal tin through. And the guards are looking for a threat object. That's not one. It's not a valid test. To say this shows it undermines airport security technology is totally wrong.\"</p> <p>Aviation security expert Philip Baum, of <a href=\"http://www.avsec.com/\" title=\"\">Green Light</a>, says: \"Pretty much every system, you can fool.\" He says that scanners use avatars \u2013 not the kind of images Corbett has put up on his blog \u2013 so talk of \"nude\" scanners is unnecessarily sensational. But he has some sympathy with the idea that scanners are a colossal waste of money.</p> <p>\"Using advanced imaging technology has its benefit,\" he says, \"providing you know what you're looking for. You need 67 machines to do the job of 20 metal detectors. So it's certainly not cost-effective \u2013 and it's questionable if it's effective in any case. You can't pick up internal carry \u2013 which is what drug smugglers do every day. And there is no technology currently screening people for explosives.\"</p> <p>But he warns that traditional archway metal detectors have very little benefit apart from the deterrent effect.</p> <p>Instead, he proposes a focused search \u2013 profiling passengers. Globally, airlines are keen to speed up and streamline security, a massively expensive, time-consuming and unpopular hassle. Currently under consideration by the international body Iata is the \"checkpoint of the future\" programme, which would divide travellers into known, trusted and others \u2013 giving some more likelihood of the unpleasantly intimate experiences readers of Corbett's blog recount in the comments. But only at the cost of providing ever more information \u2013 another civil liberties concern.</p> <p>And, Baum says, even the trusted traveller can turn \u2013 if threatened or drugged. For airline passengers, especially perhaps the mildly more irradiated American ones, the days of having a security regime that, as Corbett puts it, \"molests our families\" are a long way from over.</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron will hold talks with Barack Obama next week to ensure that Britain and America are in \"lock step\" over their forces' role in Afghanistan in the wake of news that six British soldiers are missing, believed dead. The prime minister paid tribute to the missing soldiers as he addressed a sombre Commons chamber. He also stressed the need to ensure troops had all the equipment \"between now and then\" to keep them \"as safe as possible\", as well as doing more for families at home who have lost loved ones in combat. The prime minister said troops would not be in a combat role \"anything like the numbers we're in now, at the end of 2014\". He urged the Taliban to lay down their weapons and engage in political talk to give the country a chance of peaceful progress. The five soldiers from the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and one from the 1st Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment were on mounted patrol when their Warrior armoured fighting vehicle was struck on Tuesday in Helmand province. Cameron told MPs: \"This would be the largest loss of life in a single incident in Afghanistan since 2006. It takes the overall number of casualties that we have suffered in Afghanistan to over 400. Every death and every injury reminds us of the human cost paid by our armed forces to keep our country safe.\" He said he had spoken to the chief of defence staff, General Sir David Richards, the chief of the general staff, General Sir Peter Wall, and the commanding officer of 3 Yorkshire Regiment. He said: \"Each stressed the commitment of our troops to the mission and to getting the job done. But I know everyone will want a message of support and backing for our troops and their families to go out from this House today.\" He said he would use his visit to the US to discuss the Afghanistan situation with the president. \"Next week is an opportunity to make sure that Britain and America, as the two largest contributors to the Isaf mission in Afghanistan, are absolutely in lock step about the importance of training up the Afghan army, training up the Afghan police and making sure that all Nato partners have a properly co-ordinated process for transition in that country so that the Afghans can take responsibility for the security of their own country and we can bring our forces home,\" he said. Cameron added: \"We are clearly planning the increase in the army and police which are the physical forces that will take over, but the greatest difference we could make is a stronger political settlement that will make sure Afghanistan has the chance of real peace, stability, prosperity and security in the future.\" The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, expressed his \"profound sadness at the terrible news\". \"Today is a day we are reminded of the ongoing commitment and sacrifice that our service personnel make on our behalf,\" he said. \"By putting themselves in harm's way for our benefit, they demonstrate the utmost service and courage.\" He said it was important to restate the reason for the UK military presence in Afghanistan, which was to foster \"a more stable, self-governing Afghanistan to produce more stable outcomes in that region and to ensure greater safety for our citizens here at home\". Cameron said the mission was \"vital to our national security\" to prevent Afghanistan becoming a safe haven to al-Qaida \"from where they might plan attacks on the UK or our allies\". \"Our task is simple: it's to equip the Afghan government and forces of Afghanistan with the capability and the capacity to take care of their own security without the need for foreign troops on the soil,\" he said. \"That is our aim. We are making progress.\" There were 184,000 Afghan troops, on target to reach 195,000 by the end of the year, with 145,000 police set to reach 157,000 by the end of 2012, he said. Miliband pressed the prime minister on the diplomatic progress being made on securing the broader and more inclusive political settlement needed for a stable Afghanistan. He said the whole international community needed to \"up the pace of progress\" on a political settlement before the departure of UK and allied combat troops at the end of 2014. Cameron said there were some good signs in that there were proper discussions now between the Afghan and Pakistani governments. \"There is a clear message coming out of Afghanistan and Pakistan to all those who are engaged in violence to give up that violence and to join a political process. There is strong support for that across the Arab world, particularly in the Middle East,\" he said. \"We need to give that every possible support we can and send a very clear message to the Taliban that, whether it is our troops who are there or whether it is Afghan troops who are there, they will not win on the battlefield \u2013 they never win on the battlefield \u2013 and now it is time for a political settlement to give this country a chance of peaceful progress.\" He said that the military convenant would ensure families who had lost loved ones were supported, in response to a question from Kris Hopkins, a Conservative MP who formerly served in the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, urging him to do everything possible to help them. The Ministry of Defence announced on Wednesday that troops believed to be suffering from mental health problems would be assessed in Nottingham instead of London as part of a move to save money. Troops who fear they are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health issues relating to active service, have previously been sent to St Thomas's hospital for assessment. But they will now be sent to the MoD's reinforcements training and mobilisation centre in Chilwell, Nottinghamshire. The defence minister Andrew Robathan said in a written ministerial statement that the move was designed to cut costs but said it would also make it easier for troops from the Midlands and north of England to be assessed. A high percentage of troops needing treatment came from the two regions, he said.",

It takes the overall number of casualties that we have suffered in Afghanistan to over 400. Every death and every injury reminds us of the human cost paid by our armed forces to keep our country safe.\"</p> <p>He said he had spoken to the chief of defence staff, General Sir David Richards, the chief of the general staff, General Sir Peter Wall, and the commanding officer of 3 Yorkshire Regiment.</p> <p>He said: \"Each stressed the commitment of our troops to the mission and to getting the job done. But I know everyone will want a message of support and backing for our troops and their families to go out from this House today.\"</p> <p>He said he would use his visit to the US to discuss the Afghanistan situation with the president.</p> <p>\"Next week is an opportunity to make sure that Britain and America, as the two largest contributors to the Isaf mission in Afghanistan, are absolutely in lock step about the importance of training up the Afghan army, training up the Afghan police and making sure that all Nato partners have a properly co-ordinated process for transition in that country so that the Afghans can take responsibility for the security of their own country and we can bring our forces home,\" he said.</p> <p>Cameron added: \"We are clearly planning the increase in the army and police which are the physical forces that will take over, but the greatest difference we could make is a stronger political settlement that will make sure Afghanistan has the chance of real peace, stability, prosperity and security in the future.\"</p> <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, expressed his \"profound sadness at the terrible news\".</p> <p>\"Today is a day we are reminded of the ongoing commitment and sacrifice that our service personnel make on our behalf,\" he said. \"By putting themselves in harm's way for our benefit, they demonstrate the utmost service and courage.\"</p> <p>He said it was important to restate the reason for the UK military presence in Afghanistan, which was to foster \"a more stable, self-governing Afghanistan to produce more stable outcomes in that region and to ensure greater safety for our citizens here at home\".</p> <p>Cameron said the mission was \"vital to our national security\" to prevent Afghanistan becoming a safe haven to al-Qaida \"from where they might plan attacks on the UK or our allies\".</p> <p>\"Our task is simple: it's to equip the Afghan government and forces of Afghanistan with the capability and the capacity to take care of their own security without the need for foreign troops on the soil,\" he said. \"That is our aim. We are making progress.\"</p> <p>There were 184,000 Afghan troops, on target to reach 195,000 by the end of the year, with 145,000 police set to reach 157,000 by the end of 2012, he said.</p> <p>Miliband pressed the prime minister on the diplomatic progress being made on securing the broader and more inclusive political settlement needed for a stable Afghanistan. He said the whole international community needed to \"up the pace of progress\" on a political settlement before the departure of UK and allied combat troops at the end of 2014.</p> <p>Cameron said there were some good signs in that there were proper discussions now between the Afghan and Pakistani governments. \"There is a clear message coming out of Afghanistan and Pakistan to all those who are engaged in violence to give up that violence and to join a political process. There is strong support for that across the Arab world, particularly in the Middle East,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We need to give that every possible support we can and send a very clear message to the Taliban that, whether it is our troops who are there or whether it is Afghan troops who are there, they will not win on the battlefield \u2013 they never win on the battlefield \u2013 and now it is time for a political settlement to give this country a chance of peaceful progress.\"</p> <p>He said that the military convenant would ensure families who had lost loved ones were supported, in response to a question from Kris Hopkins, a Conservative MP who formerly served in the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, urging him to do everything possible to help them.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence announced on Wednesday that troops believed to be suffering from mental health problems would be assessed in Nottingham instead of London as part of a move to save money.</p> <p>Troops who fear they are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health issues relating to active service, have previously been sent to St Thomas's hospital for assessment.</p> <p>But they will now be sent to the MoD's reinforcements training and mobilisation centre in Chilwell, Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>The defence minister Andrew Robathan said in a written ministerial statement that the move was designed to cut costs but said it would also make it easier for troops from the Midlands and north of England to be assessed.</p> <p>A high percentage of troops needing treatment came from the two regions, he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hands up all those bored rigid with the whole Chelsea saga. Back in the 1960s and 70s it was normal to have a healthy dislike for the London club, on the grounds that their showbizzy, dilettante image was vastly at odds with the working class ethos of the rest of the game, and perhaps the greatest achievement of the whole Roman Abramovich era was to install some grit and consistency where previously there had been a playboy mentality. Just for a few years, roughly the period from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to Carlo Ancelotti, Chelsea were undeniably quite good, and even people like Terry Collier from Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads \u2013 \"I can't stand Chelsea. They stand for everything I hate in football. They come out looking more like the Young Generation than a football team\" \u2013 would have had to admit it. But now that ground has been lost. Chelsea are back to being a monotonous Londoncentric story about what might be rather than what should be. After eight managers in nine years, who cares who the next one will be? Why would anyone in their right mind want to go through what Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas has just been through, let alone anyone at a functioning football success story such as Barcelona or Real Madrid? Don't say money, because Pep Guardiola and Mourinho are not exactly paupers with their noses pressed up against the Premier League's shop window. And after something in the region of \u00a3400m already spent at Stamford Bridge, this could be the exact point at which the money begins to dry up, and not just because the financial fair play rules are making it difficult to stage the sort of splurge that got Chelsea into the European elite in the first place. Even before financial fair play Abramovich had begun tightening the purse strings, making it known that he was not prepared to shell out endlessly and that he would prefer to see the club moving towards self-sufficiency. That never seemed especially likely, particularly when Abramovich took extravagant hits on first Fernando Torres then Villas-Boas, the latter not only a risky appointment but one that cost an eye-watering \u00a313m in compensation to Porto. Abramovich got just seven months for his money, a spectacular bust even for an owner who has paid out over \u00a350m to compensate his managers, but that was not why he turned up at the training ground to address the Chelsea players in person at the start of this week. That had more to do with the feeling that Steve Morgan had also picked up on at Wolves, that the players were not doing their best to help the manager out of a difficult situation. Matters are rather more urgent at Wolves, with relegation at the door and Morgan not being so ludicrously rich he can snap his fingers and find a new manager, much less fund a second coming. But just because Abramovich has played the managerial merry-go-round before does not mean he will carry on doing so for ever. An owner does not give his players pep talks unless he is worried or annoyed about something. It is hard to know exactly what motivated the inscrutable Abramovich, but it is probably safe to suppose that at some level he is not happy. With Chelsea, perhaps with football. It is widely assumed that Abramovich is spending his spare time and spare change on a club because he would like to see it win the Champions League. It may be incorrect to assume that after nine years and with an outlay approaching half a billion, and having produced a couple of near misses and a team going slowly backwards that still needs a wholesale refit, Abramovich will merely smile enigmatically and pay whatever it takes to get Mourinho or Guardiola on the job. Supposing Abramovich is as bored as the rest of us by the Chelsea shenanigans? Why should he throw good money after bad? Clearly he can afford to, but by the same token he can also afford to simply walk away. To decide that 10 years with a leading club was fun while it lasted but harder work than it initially appeared. One of the great ironies at Chelsea is that while managers have come and gone with bewildering speed, the core of the team has stayed remarkably stable. That in a way is a huge compliment to the strength of the side that Mourinho assembled, but if the Chelsea team are now so powerful that they can make or break managers it is not such a positive return. Even were Mourinho to return one could foresee difficulties, because his former favourites cannot go on forever and he would not be able to spend as freely as last time. No one is suggesting Abramovich would turn his back on Chelsea or leave them in the lurch, but he could decide that this would be a good time to install a capable manager such as David Moyes or Rafael Ben\u00edtez, and scale back the spending and the grand ambitions for a while. Because apart from anything else it must have occurred to the Russian by now that he isn't actually any good at the hiring and firing business. Chelsea would surely have had a European Cup by now had he kept hold of Mourinho, and they probably would have done the business under Guus Hiddink in 2009 but for the extraordinary display of refereeing in the semi-final against Barcelona. Hiddink certainly thinks he could have accounted for Manchester United in Rome that season, and based on the displays Chelsea and United put up against Barcelona that year he may have a point. Whatever United supporters think of that argument, there can be few who disagree that Chelsea were incredibly unlucky to miss out on a second successive Champions League final, and though the rest of Europe may have been unenthused by the prospect of Chelsea v United all over again, those heady years now stand as the high point of Abramovich's involvement with the club. The question now is whether to do it all again, at great expense and no little heartache, or whether to accept that getting to within a penalty-kick of the crown in Moscow was not a bad stab at realising a personal ambition. Who knows, maybe if Chelsea had won in 2008 or 2009 Abramovich would have started to edge towards the door a couple of seasons ago. And maybe he wouldn't. People don't know him, that is the point. People are guessing that he would like Mourinho back, but it is only a guess, as is the idea that Guardiola would be an immediate success in England after a lifetime with Barcelona. Above all, people are guessing that he will continue with this mad waste of money and managers after almost a decade of diminishing returns. This is only a guess too, but maybe Abramovich is no longer quite as in love with football as he used to be. When his 10th anniversary at Chelsea comes around, the club can celebrate a decade of great success. No European Cup perhaps, but still great success. Much more of what we have seen in the past couple of seasons, however, and the needle will start to edge back towards failure. Epic, monumental failure, in fact; failure on a scale rarely seen before. Abramovich has often been characterised as a gambler \u2013 his next call is whether to stick or twist.",

      "bodyText": "For a writer who created a race of malevolent mushroom-based life-forms inhabiting a distant world, Howard Phillips Lovecraft was not exactly what you might call a fun guy. A lonely, illness-prone child, he grew up to inhabit an insular, hermit-like life in which he suffered greatly from the deaths of his parents and eventually succumbed to a painful end from intestinal cancer in 1937. No surprise, then, that he produced an enduring body of work that had at its core bleakness, nihilism, and the frailty of the human race against the cosmic horror of all-encompassing galactic beings. Lovecraft's stories are gathered under the banner the Cthulhu Mythos, taking its name from the great, ancient god at the heart of his downbeat cosmology. Cthulhu is described by Lovecraft as \"... an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature ...\" and with \"a pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque scaly body with rudimentary wings\". What is surprising is that, the best part of a century after Cthulhu was created, the muck-encrusted god has spawned an entire industry that seems intent on making the Great Old Ones, well, cuddly. The Elder Gods alone would know what Lovecraft would make of Plush Cthulhu \u2013 the perfect accompaniment to help any self-respecting cultist embark on their own dream-quest. The idea of the slime-god forever sleeping in his underwater city of R'lyeh rendered as a soft toy is all kinds of wrong. A particular soft toy \u2013 known as Fluff Cthulhu \u2013 is a regular on the SF/Fantasy convention circuit, and may be working his eldritch magicks through his earthbound minion, the author Charles Stross. Cthulhu mints, anyone? As the makers say, \"We're just speculating here, but it would seem that a hideous, tentacle-faced monster like Cthulhu could have some seriously nasty breath.\" Perhaps wash them down with a drink from your Cthulhu Evil Elixir waterbottle? There's more. In a bid to make Lovecraft's dark creations appeal to a younger audience than intended, Bruce Brown and Dwight L MacPherson have written two graphic novels aimed at children, Howard Lovecraft and the Frozen Kingdom (which they created with artist Renzo Podesta) and Howard Lovecraft and the Undersea Kingdom (created with artist Thomas Boatwright). Putting a young Lovecraft as the protagonist at the centre of his own mythos (he's bequeathed the dreaded Necronomicon book by his father), the boy-hero Howard adventures through the squamous terrors of Lovecraft's fiction with a friendly monster he names Spot, much like a modern Little Nemo or perhaps Calvin and Hobbes. It's great stuff, well illustrated \u2013 and shows that it's never too early to expose your children to the crushing certainty that the universe is full of malicious entities who want to eat us all. Finally, no cultist's collection is complete without a selection of HP Lovecraft's words put to bluegrass music, such as the album courtesy of the Back to Lovecraft project. If you've ever wondered what the result of adding banjo and harmonica to Lovecraft's flights of fancy would be, take it from me: it certainly takes the edge off. There's only one major gap in the Lovecraft merchandising machine that I can see, so come on, Heinz \u2013 how about a special edition HP Sauce, perhaps in time for the 75th anniversary of his death on 15 March?",

      "bodyText": "\"Redemption,\" says Siza Agha, \"is recognised in every walk of life: the family, religion, law and politics. It is an integral foundation at the heart of the makeup of any democratic society. It is not recognised in dictatorships, Greek mythology and the British Olympic Association bylaw.\" Agha, a lawyer who doubles up as Dwain Chambers's agent, is a man who knows how to turn a phrase, and these days he does a lot of his client's talking for him. Chambers had his fill of it all in 2008, when his appeal against the lifetime ban imposed on him by the BOA was upheld in the high court. Now he prefers to do his talking on the track. On Saturday Chambers will do that in Istanbul as he defends his 60m title at the World Indoor Championships. A gambling man would not bet on him pulling it off, unless he had a soft spot for long odds. Chambers's fastest time this season is the 6.58sec he ran in the UK trials in Sheffield, which puts him joint 15th in the world rankings. The day after the championships, when Chambers is due to fly home with the rest of the team, the court of arbitration for sport will hold a hearing looking at the dispute between the World Anti-Doping Agency and the BOA over the bylaw, which stipulates a life ban for athletes who knowingly doped. The Cas decision will determine whether or not Chambers will be eligible to compete at the 2012 Olympics, whether he will get the shot at redemption that his agent believes he is entitled to. The coincidence in the timing of the Cas hearing and the world indoors means that Chambers is going into the championships amid renewed controversy. In a column in the Daily Mail, Daley Thompson wrote that Chambers should not be allowed to compete \"at this Olympics or any Olympics\". Soon after, the world 400m hurdles champion Dai Greene said he had a similar view. \"Dwain's a nice guy who I have, actually, a lot of respect for,\" Greene said. \"I admire how he has fought his way back to the highest level despite the abuse he received, but rules are rules and they should not make exceptions. Dwain shouldn't be allowed back into the Games.\" Greene's view seems to reflect that of many of Chambers's team-mates. Britain's head coach Charles van Commenee has described Chambers as \"a likeable guy and a damned fine athlete\". Chambers is ebullient, and always ready with a word of advice for his fellow competitors. He has been something of a mentor to the younger athletes coming through, such as the sprinter Jodie Williams, and has long since been forgiven by some of those who ran with and against him when he was doping. Christian Malcolm and Marlon Devonish were both guests at Chambers's recent wedding. But that popularity does not translate into a wider belief that he should necessarily be allowed to have a shot at running for Great Britain in the Olympics. A recent poll by ITN of 200 current athletes showed that 70% of them supported the BOA's position. Agha believes that view stems from an ignorance of the nuances of the BOA v Wada case. He is particularly scornful of Thompson, saying he is \"absolutely clueless on the real issues\", and describing his article as \"utter garbage\". Opinions such as Greene's, Agha says, are based on \"flawed reasoning and limited information\". For Agha, Chambers's case has become almost incidental to a larger question of how athletics should tackle drugs cheats. He is aligned with Wada. If the Cas decides against the BOA Chambers will be a beneficiary of a verdict that will, Agha says, make it easier for athletics to fight those who cheat. \"The nub of the issue is this: what is effective anti-drug policy?\" Agha says. \"I find it extraordinary that people are grasping on to the notion that draconian punishments are the way forward.\" Agha believes that the BOA bylaw is counterproductive for the fight against drugs in sport because it discourages athletes from coming forward and providing the information necessary to gain an understanding of how doping works. Modern drugs pass through the system so quickly that urine tests are all but useless. Blood testing is more expensive to conduct, so Wada increasingly depends on intelligence gathered from the athletes themselves. But an athlete can provide such information only by admitting their guilt. Do that, and they face a life ban. \"I don't underestimate the anti-drugs feeling, I share it,\" Agha says. \"But it is naive to think that this particular problem is going to be addressed in a laboratory in the centre of London. Does it really mean if there are zero detections during 2012 that there is no drug-taking in the Olympics? Of course it doesn't. It means the cheats haven't been detected. According to Wada the only way of detecting is through intelligence. Measures such as the BOA bylaw are stifling investigations because it is an active discouragement for athletes to come forward and provide that intelligence.\"",

      "bodyText": "London 2012 organisers have been accused by London Assembly members of running a \"closed oligopoly\" with a \"chronic lack of transparency\" after refusing to provide a breakdown of ticket sales. A London Assembly report last month criticised the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog) for not laying to rest concerns over the number of tickets available to the public for blue riband events by publishing a detailed breakdown, and the assembly member Dee Doocey said it is guilty of \"obsessive secrecy\". After questioning Lord Coe, the London 2012 chair, and the chief executive, Paul Deighton, she said it was \"shameful\" that Locog would not provide the information. Deighton confirmed that the overall number of tickets available for the session including the 100m final, once \"seat kills\" for the big screens, media positions and the like had been taken into account, is only 58,500 despite the capacity of the stadium being listed at 80,000. Of the reduced capacity, 4,500 were removed for the big screens, 10,000 for the media, 2,000 for athletes and their families, 2,000 for other accredited officials and 3,000 because they are obstructed by camera positions. Of the remaining tickets, he claimed 21,000 had been made available to the British public in the first two sales phases and more than 7,000 would be sold next month. But he argued that a large proportion of the remaining total \u2013 split between overseas visitors, sponsors and National Olympic Committees \u2013 would find their way into the hands of the British public. British buyers have been able to apply for tickets allocated to other European countries under European Commission rules and Deighton said many sponsors' tickets were being given away in competitions and to staff. Locog has argued that, with almost four million tickets left to sell across the Olympics and Paralympics, it would provide a misleading picture to break down the sales now. It has promised to do so once all tickets are sold, which is likely to be after the Games. The assembly member John Biggs said: \"It's what we perceive as a chronic lack of transparency. It seems like a closed oligopoly presenting things on a non-transparent and non-democratic basis.\" Doocey said Locog was the most secretive organisation she had encountered in eight years at City Hall and queried why the organising committee could not deliver the information on tickets sold so far. Coe and Deighton, appearing before the London Assembly for the final time before the Games, offered a robust defence of their stance. \"This is a very complicated process. To give you information in a running commentary would at worst be inaccurate and be frankly misleading,\" said Coe. \"I'm not going to divert the attention of my teams, who have four million tickets to sell and revenue targets to meet. I'm not going to take them off that focus to work on [calculating] every single client group for every single session.\" He said Locog would deliver on all of its promises \u2013 namely to get 75% of the 8.8m total into the hands of British public, with two-thirds at \u00a350 or less and \"proportionate numbers of tickets at every price point\". He added: \"We are being entirely transparent here and we are determined to get through the ticketing process.\" The final batch of 1.3m tickets will go on sale in late April, with priority given to those who were unsuccessful in the first phase of sales. There are also around 1.5m football tickets remaining, while several hundred thousand tickets across all events will be released for sale in public box offices until the opening ceremony as seat configurations are finalised. It is understood the calculations in most of the other venues are roughly the same as in the main stadium. That means that around a fifth of the quoted capacity is unusable before a single ticket has been sold. In the 6,000 capacity velodrome, that equates to a net capacity of only 4,500. If around half the tickets have been made available in the public sale, that equates to only 2,250 tickets on offer on the biggest nights. In some venues, such as Wembley Arena, which will host badminton and rhythmic gymnastics, the number of \"seat kills\" is higher (30%) while at Wembley Stadium it is only 6%. Deighton insisted the tickets available to the public had been equally divided between the four or five price points on offer. In those sessions where there were five price points, he said the number available in each would range from 18% to 22% of the total. \"We have not indulged in what the airlines would call yield management. We could, based on demand, push up the price of the tickets that are left and they would be bought. We are not doing that,\" he said. Locog expects the number of tickets available to remain fluid until the Games because of the unprecedented number of temporary venues that have to be constructed. Deighton defended the use of a firm in Arkansas to print 11m Olympic and Paralympic tickets. He said the firm had won an \"open, competitive and detailed\" tender process and offered the best value for money. He claimed 94% of contracts had gone to British firms.",

It seems like a closed oligopoly presenting things on a non-transparent and non-democratic basis.\" Doocey said Locog was the most secretive organisation she had encountered in eight years at City Hall and queried why the organising committee could not deliver the information on tickets sold so far.</p> <p>Coe and Deighton, appearing before the London Assembly for the final time before the Games, offered a robust defence of their stance. \"This is a very complicated process. To give you information in a running commentary would at worst be inaccurate and be frankly misleading,\" said Coe. \"I'm not going to divert the attention of my teams, who have four million tickets to sell and revenue targets to meet. I'm not going to take them off that focus to work on [calculating] every single client group for every single session.\"</p> <p>He said Locog would deliver on all of its promises \u2013 namely to get 75% of the 8.8m total into the hands of British public, with two-thirds at \u00a350 or less and \"proportionate numbers of tickets at every price point\". He added: \"We are being entirely transparent here and we are determined to get through the ticketing process.\"</p> <p>The final batch of 1.3m tickets will go on sale in late April, with priority given to those who were unsuccessful in the first phase of sales. There are also around 1.5m football tickets remaining, while several hundred thousand tickets across all events will be released for sale in public box offices until the opening ceremony as seat configurations are finalised.</p> <p>It is understood the calculations in most of the other venues are roughly the same as in the main stadium. That means that around a fifth of the quoted capacity is unusable before a single ticket has been sold. In the 6,000 capacity velodrome, that equates to a net capacity of only 4,500. If around half the tickets have been made available in the public sale, that equates to only 2,250 tickets on offer on the biggest nights.</p> <p>In some venues, such as Wembley Arena, which will host badminton and rhythmic gymnastics, the number of \"seat kills\" is higher (30%) while at Wembley Stadium it is only 6%.</p> <p>Deighton insisted the tickets available to the public had been equally divided between the four or five price points on offer. In those sessions where there were five price points, he said the number available in each would range from 18% to 22% of the total.</p> <p>\"We have not indulged in what the airlines would call yield management. We could, based on demand, push up the price of the tickets that are left and they would be bought. We are not doing that,\" he said.</p> <p>Locog expects the number of tickets available to remain fluid until the Games because of the unprecedented number of temporary venues that have to be constructed.</p> <p>Deighton defended the use of a firm in Arkansas to print 11m Olympic and Paralympic tickets. He said the firm had won an \"open, competitive and detailed\" tender process and offered the best value for money. He claimed 94% of contracts had gone to British firms.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last July the Guardian was investigating the elusive, mysterious individuals behind LulzSec and Anonymous \u2013 the loose hacker groups who had suddenly become front page news, as they led a wave of cyber attacks against a range major corporations and law enforcement. One individual, or one hacker name, stood out: Sabu, a proflic hacker often referred to as the leader of the groups. Getting to Sabu was not easy; he was well aware of the illegal nature of his activities. But that month, the Guardian had a stroke of luck. Sabu objected violently to a piece we had carried, examining \u2013 and shooting down \u2013 allegations from a rival pro-US hacker that Sabu was using Anonymous and Lulzsec to push an extreme Islamic agenda. He asked me to join him in an off-the-record internet chat \u2013 a conversation that happened seven weeks after Sabu, now unmasked as Hector Xavier Monsegur, had already been picked up by the FBI. Given the latest revelations about Sabu's activities, that he worked as an informer from after his arrest on 7 June until just a few days ago, I think it is appropriate to publish a few extracts from our conversation. Sabu \u2013 and we cannot even be sure that our correspondant was the real Monsegur and not a US agent \u2013 was not representing himself accurately to the newspaper. If anything, he was testing the Guardian out, openly flirting with the notion that he worked for the CIA \u2013 and then inviting me to knock him down. Less than three weeks later, Monsegur pleaded guilty to 12 counts relating to computer hacking in secret, which carry a maximum sentence of 124 years and six months. But there is no sign in the logs of a man under pressure. Sabu began by denouncing the Guardian's publication of the vague allegations of the supposed Islamic links of the hacker community. Then he switched tack, asking why the paper hadn't published rumours linking him to the CIA, arguing that would amount to an equivalent and equally inaccurate allegation. Given what we know now, the swerve is particularly noteworthy. In case it is not obvious, my online name is  .  OK. I'm waiting for the article discussing the potential of me being the leader of a CIA blackops operation and me denying it.  can we work on it now?  I'll begin my message   : I thank you for brining up this serious allegation but I deny being part of the CIA or any black operations unit/organization.  I am an activist and security researcher. Not a CIA operative Moments later, I strayed even closer to what had become Sabu's emerging double life (remember, the indictments released yesterday refer to Monsegur only being a member of Anonymous until 7 June 2011, the day of his arrest). I linked a recent Guardian story \u2013 unaware of any ironies \u2013 suggesting the FBI had managed to recruit a full quarter of all US hackers as informants:  The CIA has done more blackops and terror operations than al-qaeda could ever do  so, lets be realistic  Something we covered: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/06/us-hackers-fbi-informer  That has literally nothing to do with what I'm talking about  and I must say if your article is correct - the FBI is doin a very bad job at recruiting informants.  Well, you were mentioning CIA blackops/etc. It's related.  No it is not At the time, I was bemused if not baffled by our exchange \u2013 and totally unable to see any motivation for Sabu's keenness that we start publishing what seemed to amount to little more than conspiracy theories about the operations of Anonymous and Lulzsec. With hindsight, I wonder whether Sabu was trying in some way to set out a warning, or red flag to other hackers. Or perhaps he was goading me to see if I actually believed he might be a turncoat. Either way, these were signals I missed at that the time. My other thought, looking back on the logs, is whether Sabu was thinking aloud as to why he was being asked to become an FBI informant rather than being publicly prosecuted. Here's more; here Sabu says some are claiming he had been working \"with the CIA\" although having closely followed the debate at the time this is not an allegation I can recall having seen aired:  When can I expect an article discussing the idea of me being with the CIA and my denial?  I'm eager to see this happen.  So I see. May I ask why?  Hmm...? is it not obvious?  Not totally. And I'd prefer to hear rather than jump to wrong conclusions  There is no wrong conclusion if you have been a part of this conversation  You just said there was a claim that I may be a terrorist. You \"researched\" it and wrote the article  There re claims I am with the CIA pushing to get tighter / stricter cyber-laws passed  its literally the same shit, two different extremes. Then, intriguingly, he goes onto say that UK and US goverments have been involved in covert operations, before going to say that he could not be linked to terrorism. Anonymous or LulzSec would not carry out their operations so publicly if they had an ulterior motive.  The people are aware that our governments in the UK and the US have involved themselves in black operations in the past. it makes a lot of sense if lets say a rogue group of hackers suddenly began attaking national interests -- spawning a massive overhaul of internet security, theoretically.  you're telling me thats not worse than some random jihadist who barely knows how to use a computer in the first place, \"hacking\"/  Also heres where your entire point is flawed into oblivion  why would a terrorist release and dump 90,000 INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY MILITARY PERSONELL PASSWORDS AND EMAILS when they can just intercept military intelligence communications for the next year using this data ?  Why would osama bin laden go through all the work of hacking booz allan [a US government and defence consultancy], just to post a pastebin with an ascii art mocking the security of federal contractors.  Be realistic.  Think. Even as an FBI informer, Sabu would not be in a position to have evidence to back up his theories that the CIA were angling for a tightening of US cyber laws. Those co-operating with the authorities to mitigate their sentancing are rarely handed US government secrets. Instead, what's interesting is Sabu's internal reasoning for why \u2013 hypothetically at least \u2013 a compromised organisation (as we know now LulzSec was) might be allowed to continue. One factor in the decision to make some of this public was an unusual comment towards the end of the conversation, in which Sabu advised me to make sure I kept a log, or transcript, of the chat for later use:  AS FOR THE LOG I don't do interviews or usually paste chatlogs so I'm keeping it privately  so I suggest you do the same At this stage, surely Sabu would have known, or at least suspected, that his agreement to turn evidence against other members of Lulzsec would eventually become public. Re-reading this now, one wonders if he was hoping that some of our conversation would eventually become public too - an interview, in effect, at the point when he couldn't speak for himself. Just over a fortnight after these published exchanges, we now know that Monsegur \u2013 aka Sabu \u2013 secretly pleaded guilty to 12 counts of computer hacking. From June to March this year, he \u2013 and his FBI handlers \u2013 were party to details, often in advance, of hacking attacks including the interception of an FBI conference call, and the seizure of 5m emails from the servers of UK intelligence firm Stratfor, which are currently being published by WikiLeaks. On Tuesday, charges were lain against five individuals alleged to be core members of Anonymous and Lulzsec \u2013 and the man behind Sabu was finally publicly unmasked as a 28-year-old unemployed Puerto Rican living in New York.",

His first column, under the title Long Life, will be published this week. It follows his recent departure from The Guardian. The picture above shows him on his final day as editor of The Spectator in 1984, a framed copy of which can be found in the office of the magazine's current editor, Fraser Nelson. \"I'm a huge fan,\" he says. Nelson has also appointed the historian and playwright, Douglas Murray, as a contributing editor. The new signings arrive as The Spectator celebrates a rise in readership, having attracted a new audience through its apps for Kindle and iPad. The magazine recorded a drop in its officially audited print circulation last time around, but that's because it dropped its bulk sales. Then again, looking more closely at the figures, I note that its actively-purchased copies rose for the first time in five years - up to 38,558 in 2011 compared to 38,431 in the previous year. Sure, it's only a small increase, but any rise in print sales nowadays has to be seen as a blessing. Sales sources: ABC/The Spectator",

The veteran games designer will also give up his position as creative director of Microsoft Games Studios Europe. In a statement to US game site, Kotaku, he said: \"It is with mixed emotions that I made the decision to leave Microsoft and Lionhead Studios, the company that I co-founded in 1997, at the conclusion of development of Fable: The Journey. \"I remain extremely passionate and proud of the people, products and experiences that we created, from Black &amp; White to Fable to our pioneering work with Milo and Kate for the Kinect platform. However, I felt the time was right to pursue a new independent venture.\" A message on Molyneux's Twitter account reads simply, \"I have left the lovely amazing Microsoft and lionhead. Now for something really amazing, scary and brave a new company called 22 Cans.\" There are no further details on the new studio, or what platforms it will develop for. We contacted Molyneux's spokeswoman earlier who said he'd remain quiet about future projects for a while. Awarded an OBE for services to the games industry in 2005, Peter Molyneux has been a key figure in British development for over twenty years. His first major title, Populous, is credited with, if not creating then certainly popularising, the whole 'god game' genre. He formed Lionhead in 1997 after leaving his original studio, Bullfrog, following its purchase by Electronic Arts. At Lionhead, Molyneux went on to oversee the development of ambitious fantasy sim Black &amp; White, before launching the first of the best-selling Fable adventures. Designed for Xbox and PC, the franchise would quickly become a major series for Microsoft's console. Lionhead was purchased by Microsoft in 2006. A question mark now hangs over both Lionhead and Fable. According to Kotaku, the studio's co-founder Mark Webley will now take charge. This isn't the only senior departure from the Fable titles. Last summer, Simon Carter, who along with his brother Dene devised the Fable concept while working at their own studio Big Blue Box, left Lionhead to start up his own studio. It was recently announced that Simon and Dene had now set up Another World, to work on digitally distrubuted games. The news has been well hidden until this point. Peter Molyneux attended last week's Xbox Live Showcase event in San Francisco and gave a passionate talk about Fable: The Journey. Although his ambitions have often exceeded the reach of his titles at times (generating much controversy in the process) he remains one of the greatest communicators about the thrill of game design. Whatever his next project is, it will be closely watched by the industry.",

      "bodyText": "Will the US, Britain and other countries with combat troops in Afghanistan cut their losses and leave Afghanistan as quickly as possible, leading UK security analysts were asked. Yes, came the resounding reply. This was not a knee-jerk response to the news that six more British soldiers had been attacked, presumed dead. It was a growing realisation, even among those who in the past have been supportive of the Nato-led mission in Afghanistan, that nothing useful can be done now by foreign troops who continue to be exposed on the front line. On Tuesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator and most hawkish supporter of America's military presence in Afghanistan, said unless President Hamid Karzai relented on his demands that night raids against suspected insurgents must stop and the US hands over to the Afghans control of prisoners \"then there is no hope of winning. None\". These two issues are crucial in the current negotiations on a US-Afghanistan status of forces agreement, which would provide the legal basis for the presence of US \u2013 and, by implication, British \u2013 troops in Afghanistan beyond the end of 2014, the deadline President Barack Obama and David Cameron have set for transferring full control of the country, and the country's security, to the Afghans. \"I am going to pull the plug on Afghanistan from a personal point of view if we don't get this strategic partnership signed,\" Graham said. Karzai seems unlikely to relent, independent observers said on Wednesday. The senator's comments reflect the many contradictory and conflicting pressures facing Britain and the US in Afghanistan. There is widespread recognition, for example, that night raids by US and UK special forces may have led to the killing or capture of Taliban commanders. But these are precisely the commanders influenced by the old Taliban leadership under Mullah Omar who might have been persuaded to come to the negotiating table \u2013 a hope Cameron expressed in the Commons on Wednesday. Yet these Taliban commanders are being replaced by younger, more radical, leaders indulging in more brutal tactics and strongly opposed to any deal with Karzai, let alone foreigners. That Britain's military intervention in Afghanistan was politically driven and badly executed, is evident from the Afghan Papers, a devastating critique just published by the Royal United Services Institute. \"However we eventually interpret the outcome of Britain's fourth Afghan war \u2026 the process of engagement in it during 2006 was less than satisfactory from almost every point of view,\" says the institute's director, Michael Clarke. Understandably, General Sir David Richards, chief of the defence staff, makes consoling remarks and British and US military commanders continue to express optimism. They also express concern about the deadlines and phased troop withdrawals announced by their political masters. But just as the entry into Afghanistan was politically driven, so will the exit be. Obama has announced cuts of some 30,000 troops in Afghanistan and says the remaining 68,000 US troops there will be \"coming home at a steady pace\". Cameron has said Britain's 9,500-strong force (excluding 500 special forces) will be cut by 1,000 by the end of 2012 and that any British troops remaining after 2014 will no longer be in a combat role. That time frame may well be shortened at the Nato summit in Chicago in May. \"It is very unlikely that the troop drawdowns will be reversed, because of a combination of war weariness, financial pressure and the perceived reduction in the clear and present danger posed by al-Qaida,\" the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in its latest military balance survey, published on Wednesday. \"Indeed,\", it added, \"political and financial difficulties in Nato states may increase pressure to accelerate the withdrawals.\" Foreign troops will leave behind massive corruption, a huge increase in heroin production, and a country reliant on foreign aid pouring in for many years to come, the IISS says in a report, Afghanistan to 2015 and Beyond. British military commanders put on a brave face, pointing to the relative stability they have brought at least to parts of Helmand province, where more than 400 of their soldiers have now lost their lives.",

      "bodyText": "A vigorous dispute has broken out over Scottish independence after a report claimed that North Sea oil would have made Scotland better off than the rest of the UK last year. The Scottish government's annual analysis of spending and revenue showed that Scotland had a smaller deficit proportionally than the rest of the UK in 2010-11, but only if its full geographical share of North Sea oil revenues, worth nearly \u00a38.8bn last year, was included. Opposition parties said the figures proved how heavily dependent Scotland was on fluctuating oil revenues and public-sector debt to fund expensive services such as free university tuition and prescriptions. John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said Scotland would be in a stronger position to decide how to spend its taxes with a full share of oil, which his government calculates would be worth 81% of all the UK's North Sea oil and gas revenues. Including a per capita share of the UK's annual debt repayments, Scotland's deficit for last year would have been equal to 4.4% of GDP, compared with 6.6% for the UK. With this year's oil revenues expected to be around \u00a311bn, \u00a32.2bn more than last year, an independent Scotland would again be relatively better off than the rest of the UK. The oil industry had assets worth \u00a31tn and oil revenues were expected to be \"substantial\" in future, despite a decline in production. \"With responsibility for our own finances and our own vast natural resources, we will be able to make choices in our own best interests,\" Swinney said. \"With independence, we would control the fiscal levers we need to suit our own economic circumstances and maximise Scotland's potential to secure new investment and jobs.\" He said that, with oil revenues, Scotland generated 9.6% of the UK's total tax revenues while having 8.4% of the population. Using that measure, Scotland had been better off overall than the UK as a whole for the last five years. Opposition parties angrily contested that analysis. The Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) report showed that Scotland received \u00a310.6bn more last year in UK government spending than it raised in taxes, including its majority share of oil revenues. Total spending was \u00a363.8bn, while \u00a345bn was raised in taxes without including oil, or \u00a353bn including oil. Over the last five years, the gap between spending and total revenues was between \u00a33bn and \u00a314bn a year, even including oil. Without it, Scotland had an \u00a318.6bn deficit last year, raising serious doubts about Alex Salmond's claim that Scotland could invest some oil revenues into a new oil fund. Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary in the UK government, said it was encouraging that oil revenues had increased but Scotland's deficit was even deeper when capital spending on roads, rail, schools and hospitals was included, a measure known as the net fiscal balance. That measure showed Scotland had a deficit of \u00a310.7bn, or 7.4% of its GDP, last year and he said Gers had ignored the hefty financial power of the Bank of England and the UK Treasury, which played a critical role in rescuing the UK economy and Scotland's ailing banks. \"Scotland is an integral part of the UK and also benefits from the UK-wide spending on the wider economy \u2013 including the essential stabilisation of the banking system, deficit reduction, quantitative easing and other projects led by the UK government,\" Moore said. \"There is little point in the Scottish government saying Scotland's finances are stronger than the UK's \u2013 that relies on a number of omissions and fails to take account of the interwoven nature of the UK's spending. \"Scotland is thankfully not separate from the UK's public sector spending and it is up to those seeking independence to explain what the benefits of leaving a system which equally shares risk and reward would be.\" The Scottish Labour party said the deficit destroyed the Scottish National party's case that the country was being \"diddled\" by the rest of the UK and underlined the importance for Scotland of remaining in the union to share risks and rewards. Ken Macintosh, the party's finance spokesman, said oil revenues had fluctuated wildly in recent years and were too unreliable to fund current public spending levels. At its lowest point in 2009-10, oil raised \u00a36.5bn in taxes, half last year's revenues. \"This shows the huge economic benefits of Scotland working in partnership with the rest of the UK and explodes the myth that somehow Scotland's finances are being diddled by the club we are part of,\" he said. \"The report shows that, if the SNP get their way, Scotland would have to raise taxes, cut public services or borrow more at a higher rate.\" Gavin Brown, the Scottish Tory finance spokesman, said Scotland would be facing a huge deficit even with oil. \"For the second year running we have experienced a multibillion-pound loss, leading to a staggering \u00a321.5bn deficit since 2002,\" he said. \"This is a considerable gap and the SNP must start to explain how they would plan to plug the gap should Scotland separate from the rest of the UK. The reality is that the only way this could be achieved is through raising taxes, cutting spending or plunging us deeper into debt by borrowing more. \"Instead of the Scottish taxpayer shouldering this burden it is currently spread evenly across the rest of the UK. By using the strength of our union we are more able to cope with this deficit and these figures now make it clear that Scotland is undoubtedly better off in Britain.\"",

I remain 100% committed to the Rangers and will do whatever I can to advance its interests.\" King had also claimed it is \"inevitable\" that Rangers will go into liquidation. A spokesman for the Murray Group issued a response which read: \"We note with some interest, and much incredulity, Dave King's press statement. It is difficult to understand his motives, given he has been a director of Rangers since 2000. \"Throughout the period of his directorship, Dave King has attended and participated in regular board meetings, including those approving the annual audited accounts, received board papers quarterly, had full access to the executive management of the club, and been privy to the same detailed financial and commercial information as every other board member.

It is deeply regrettable and hugely saddening for all the employees and supporters that the club finds itself in its present situation.\" Rangers' players are continuing talks with administrators over proposed wage cuts.

Bob Quick, then chief constable of Surrey, said he was called in to review the cash for honours criminal investigation led by Yates. He gave it a clean bill of health but in January 2007 Quick was called in again after Britain's top civil servant, Gus O'Donnell, complained that the police were leaking details to the media. O'Donnell specifically named Yates as the source of the leaks from the investigation, which menaced the then Labour government. Quick alleges that the then Met deputy commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, did not implement his recommendation that the phone records of Yates, who was leading the inquiry, should be examined for evidence that he was leaking against the Labour government or evidence ruling him out. Quick alleges he clashed with Yates over his suggestion. As he resisted the suggestion, Yates told him: \"No Bob, I am very well connected.\" Quick told Leveson his review found no evidence implicating Yates as the leaker. In 2000, Quick, then part of Scotland Yard's anti-corruption command, wanted to investigate newspapers after a covert operation revealed corrupt payments to police officers for information. Quick added that in 2000 it struck him as possible that newspaper organisations were aware of the reasons for the payments and were themselves complicit in making corrupt payments to police officers. His report was submitted to his then boss, Andy Hayman, but no action was taken, the inquiry heard. Quick said that in 2000 it was clear tabloid journalists, most likely with their bosses' blessing, were bribing officers: \"There were considerable grounds to believe that journalists from tabloid newspapers were corruptors.\"",

      "bodyText": "Fashion has outgrown the catwalk show. Now that the industry is a worldwide entertainment business, with celebrity-packed audiences and global-reach livestreamed collections, beautiful women wearing beautiful clothes is simply no longer enough to satisfy the audience. Louis Vuitton once again raised the bar on the 21st-century phenomenon of the fashion spectacular. Guests arriving at the marquee erected in one of the larger courtyards of the Louvre found themselves in a lifesize facsimile of a train station, complete with ornately arching ironwork and a giant station clock. As the clock struck 10, steam began to emerge from behind the black gates at the far end of the catwalk, a false floor was pulled back to reveal train tracks, and the Louis Vuitton express \u2013 a handsome one-carriage train liveried in navy and gold, built especially for the show \u2013 pulled into the \"station\". An elegant, all-female cast of travellers, who could be seen through the train windows, descended on to the station one by one, each accompanied by a uniformed, white-gloved porter carrying her handbag and luggage. Beneath the theatre and showmanship the event sent a clear business message. Marc Jacobs's previous collection for Vuitton, last October, starred feminine pastels worn by models posed sidesaddle on a giant fairground carousel, inspired by the famous carousel in the Tuileries gardens. Decorous and idyllic, it read as a love letter to Paris fashion. It was hard not to wonder if Jacobs, who at that time was in negotiations concerning a move to Dior, was experimenting with how things might be if he were to take the post at perhaps the most storied of all the Parisian fashion houses. This most recent show, by contrast, read as a public declaration of love for Louis Vuitton, the house where Jacobs remains. Within the finely calibrated ranks of fashion snobbery, Vuitton's yearly revenue of \u00a35.42bn can go only so far in counterbalancing its lowly beginnings as a luggage company. To stage one of the most extravagant, glamorous catwalk shows Paris fashion has ever seen \u2013 and to put a working train and porters at the centre of it \u2013 is a confident statement from Jacobs and Vuitton about pride in what the house stands for. Rail travel was the starting point for the Vuitton empire, one of Louis Vuitton's first commercially significant innovations being to produce flat suitcases which could be stacked in luggage racks and were therefore more practical than the traditional round-topped trunks. Luggage and fashion were intertwined in every aspect of this collection. After the show, Jacobs retreated from the jostling camera crews into the train carriage, where he explained that \"the whole collection started with the idea for the train. From there we thought about what bags the woman would have on the train, what she would be wearing, where she would be going.\" Sarah Jessica Parker, a longtime Jacobs fan who was in the front row, joined the designer on the grey velvet banquette to proclaim the show \"one of the great triumphs of all time \u2026 it was cinema, it was literature. It was wonderful!\" Catherine Deneuve arrived to compliment Jacobs on the ostrich-skin coats. Not to be outdone, Natalia Vodianova, who is one of Jacobs's favourite models (and as girlfriend of LVMH scion Antoine Arnault, close to being his boss's wife) declared it a \"fashion orgasm\". Elements of Vuitton's luggage history were used in the clothes themselves. The chequerboard \"damier\" pattern, which has been used on suitcases since 1888 \u2013 eight years longer than the more famous LV monogram \u2013 appeared as patterns on evening dresses. Ornate fastenings linked clothes and luggage, with outsize jewelled clasps appearing as buttons on dresses and at the closure of handbags. The fashion message of the show was in the silhouette, which echoed the narrow shapes seen on the Chanel and Prada catwalks. \"We wanted to attenuate the height, so we started with the hats [by the British milliner Stephen Jones] and then worked with a high waist, and a gentle flare just at the ankle.\" Jacobs described it as \"a turn of the century feel, but with bits of the 1960s and 1970s. It's not about researching a specific period. It's about having romantic notions of an era and making it beautiful. It doesn't matter if the looks in your head never existed before. That's good.\" Asked what will become of the splendid Louis Vuitton express, Jacobs said he had suggested to the retail team \"that it could be used as a pop-up store somewhere\". But first, Jacobs and Vuitton are focused on the Louis Vuitton \u2013 Marc Jacobs exhibition, which opens on Friday at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris. The show examines in parallel what the founder and the current designer have brought to the label, and explores how the work of each engaged with the advances and challenges of their era \u2013 travel and industrialisation in the case of Vuitton, globalisation and a communications revolution for Jacobs.",

      "bodyText": "European promises to support people in need have been thoroughly tested in recent times and Europe collectively has failed in that test. We urgently need a common asylum system that rebalances the responsibility among EU member states. In historical terms, the number of asylum seekers arriving in Europe is low but some points of entry are under enormous pressure and are not equipped to correctly process the claims of asylum seekers. This flawed system is not only unfair on those who seek refuge; it is also unfair on a public who need to know that the system is helping those most in need. I will be discussing the common European asylum system with home affairs ministers from all EU countries on 8 March, and I'll be looking to participants to step up their efforts, as negotiations have so far been too slow. Part of the reason can be seen in our economic climate. But as the crisis has kept the European Union looking inward for many months now, unrest in northern Africa and elsewhere has forced many to leave their homes. So, can Europe stay committed to helping those in need of shelter, while handling our own economic difficulties? Some statistics give cause for concern. In the first three quarters of 2011, more than 75% of all asylum applications were made in only six EU member states. The UK was one of them: it received almost 20,000 applications. This is a lot, though only about half the number for France or Germany, and less than Belgium or Sweden. And as over 700,000 people fled the violence in Libya, many ended up in refugee camps in neighbouring countries. Of the 8,000 people identified by the UN as being in particular need of help, EU member states only agreed to receive 400. Norway, a non-EU country, accepted nearly as many by itself. Meanwhile, in 2011 more than 50,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean in rickety vessels to the EU. Far too many died trying; around 1,500 people according to new data from the UN. Others arrived at the Italian island of Lampedusa and in Malta. Other European countries did not step up to the plate and help. Only 300 refugees were relocated from Malta to other member states. Of these, the UK accepted only 10. At the same time, the UK is one of the 10 member states with a long-standing tradition of resettling refugees through the UN system, which is something to be proud of. In 2010, the UK accepted 720 such refugees who had been stranded in countries where they had no future; the second highest figure in the EU. However, the political mood in many EU member states is sour. We have not seen as many populist and xenophobic parties in European national parliaments since before the second world war. True to form, they exploit the current crisis, trying to shift the blame on to immigrant populations. Here, we need European and national leadership to make sure that populist rhetoric does not dictate the agenda. Because, contrary to what the xenophobes would have us believe, the number of asylum seekers in Europe is far lower today than 10 years ago. And Europe is by no means exceptionally open in its asylum policies. There are far more refugees in Kenya alone than in the 27 EU countries. However, unforeseen events like the Arab spring can overstretch the asylum capacity of any country, and Europe has to be prepared to support member states so that people are received in dignity. Despite common minimum rules, several countries' asylum systems provide unacceptable reception conditions for migrants. And standards in granting refugee status differ greatly between countries. Such disparities are not acceptable in an EU where we have signed the same international conventions and unite around the same values. The EU needs common high standards and stronger co-operation to ensure that asylum seekers are treated equally in an open and fair system \u2013 wherever they apply. That is why the EU has been inching towards a common asylum policy for over a decade, and has set a deadline of 2012 for putting the common system into place. But, again, negotiations are too slow-moving and talks need to be intensified. I am convinced that we are perfectly capable of dealing with our economic difficulties while staying true to our ideals of openness, tolerance and solidarity. Our commitment cannot be a zero-sum game. This year, I expect all the ministers in the council to make good on their promises, commit to mutual assistance and finally put the common asylum system into place. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "The political class held its collective breath when Peter Mandelson made his third comeback in 2008 after Gordon Brown summoned him back from Brussels to join the cabinet. So Westminster will be beside itself with excitement when it realises that Lord Mandelson is embarking on a fourth comeback. But this one has a twist. Mandelson is being summoned back by opponents and, as befits an international businessman with a swanky \"portfolio\" lifestyle, he doesn't actually have to do anything. Vince Cable's leaked letter, in which the business secretary complained that the coalition lacks a \"compelling vision\" for a growth strategy, could have been written by Mandelson. Cable's call for a \"stronger steer from government\" on identifying, and then supporting, key technologies is almost identical to the \"industrial activism\" championed by Mandelson after the financial crash. Mandelson was succeeded as business secretary by Cable after the 2010 general election. If Cable's aping of Mandelson is a surprise, then how about the decision of an even greater foe to seek inspiration from one of the main founders of New Labour? Ed Miliband, who regards Mandelson as a rather snotty sixth former, paid warm tribute to the way in which he revived the department of business, innovation and skills. In his speech to the EEF conference on Tuesday, the Labour leader said: If we want to understand that there is a difference between protectionism and patriotism we should compare what happened in the car industry in Britain in the 1970s with the recent recession. In the seventies, we did prop up loss-making lame ducks. Thirty years later the government provided support, but not to prop up companies that were uncompetitive, but to prevent the recession destroying fundamentally healthy British plants. That was because government, unions and management worked together and Peter Mandelson recognised the need for a change in attitude. We see the response today; the new Nissan investment is a culmination of that approach. The Business Department stopped being a sleepy backwater and became a great office of state. What's the lesson I draw from this? To work, an active industrial strategy must have real vision, real drive right across government. And I don't think the government gets it. That was quite a tribute by Miliband. He was furious during the 2010 leadership contest when Mandelson warned that the younger Miliband was in danger of killing New Labour. Ed Miliband soon realised that Mandelson's intervention was a gift. David Miliband takes the same view \u2013 he believes Mandelson's intervention deprived him of the Labour leadership. Perhaps it will now only be a matter of time before Mandelson stages his fifth comeback. George Osborne, who has always regarded Mandelson with an edgy respect, is said to see him as a worthy successor to Pascal Lamy as director-general of the World Trade Organisation.",

Did you know that Mitt Romney tried to make a casual $10,000 bet in the middle of a political debate? Did you know that the Eclipse, Roman Abramovich's \u20ac340m (and counting) yacht, is equipped with a guided-missile defense system? Did you know that the author of this post bought all the incredible items pictured below for \u20ac25 total? Yes, dear readers, all of this is possible and more at the Via Sannio outdoor market! It is truly a place you can shop until you stop, because, well, you really didn't have that much money to spend in the first place. Who needs hot tubs and heli-pads when you can have a whole new outfit for a millionth of the price? The famous Sunday market at Porta Portese may be the mega-yacht of used-good markets in Rome, but the market at Via Sannio is the tugboat. It is much smaller than its cousin by the Tiber but it puts in the dirty work, as it is open every day except Sunday. Because of its moderate size, the market can be navigated in an easy, but thorough, 30-45 minutes. The wares of the Via Sannio market range from \u20ac1 heaps of clothes, to authentic cashmere sweaters, to high-end leather and fur (note: fur purchases frowned upon by author), although stalls selling used trinkets are less common. Buyer beware, however: the men who own the stalls of new \"designer\" clothing at the market's entrances are extremely touchy and aggressive. Where is this glorious garden of goods, where the mere pauper plays the prince? The market lies an easy walk from the San Giovanni metro stop (Linea A) and the area surrounding San Giovanni in Laterano (accessible by many buses, such as the 714, 650, 87, 85, 81, 16, etc). Here it is on Google Maps. You may never be able to buy a diamond chain of yourself wearing a yacht armed with guided missiles, but you can bet your bottom dollar (see what I did there?) you can find some incredible bargains in the friendly confines of Via Sannio.

      "bodyText": "There was a priceless moment in Sunday's majestic BBC2 documentary The Four Year Plan, in which QPR's then-owner Flavio Briatore fumed at some supporters: \"Give me the names of the ones booing me or I sell the club!\" Apparently unaccustomed to chants of \"Briatore is a wanker\" from his Formula One days, Briatore had experienced the distaste of the fans, and found it a deep affront to his personage. Like many billionaires, he was amusingly sensitive, even though the abuse he took was not in the ballpark of that directed towards the Glazer family at Manchester United, or Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool, or Mike Ashley at Newcastle, or indeed all manner of other owners up and down the leagues. One who has thus far escaped such indignities, however, is \"enigmatic\" Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Not for Roman the vulgar ingratitude of the crowd, the banners cordially inviting him to do one back to Siberia, the vaguely unmannerly death threats. Ever since he pitched up, Chelsea supporters have appeared unflinchingly appreciative of all their Russian benefactor has done for them, declining even to give him a hard time when the beloved Jos\u00e9 Mourinho found his desk in the lift. Chants of \"Roman Abramovich sacks who he wants\" were as disrespectful as it got at Birmingham on Tuesday night. Of course, Abramovich was vastly different from those owners who acquired their clubs via leveraged buyouts and the like. Chelsea supporters found themselves indebted in a different way, given that Abramovich is widely held to be slightly richer than Croesus, paid cash for the club, and has seemed content to spend whatever it took to ensure success. They were resolutely grateful, as well they might be. But what do your instincts tell you now? Can this deference continue? And more pressingly, how would Abramovich react if it didn't? In many ways, the fallout from the Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas sacking is the usual hot air. The League Managers Association has branded Chelsea's situation an \"embarrassment\", which is unlikely to have caused the Russian to reach for the smelling salts. You don't claw your way up from selling rubber ducks to acquiring a vast chunk of Russia's post-Soviet oil and mineral wealth only to be wounded by the emotional posturings of some 15th-tier local bureaucrat. But another phrase bandied about with increasing frequency may prove a worthier foe. Across the airwaves and the internet this week, you could find Chelsea fans opining that Abramovich had made their club a \"laughing stock\" \u2013 a position that may yet find more aggressive voice in the stands at Stamford Bridge. For the more dispassionate observer, Abramovich himself is the laughing stock \u2013 a preposterous little Caesar who has behaved in such a way that the Swansea City manager, Brendan Rodgers, has ruled himself out of running one of the most high-profile clubs in the world because he's not looking to \"destroy\" his career, while Mourinho himself doubtless relishes the chance to make his former tormentor beg for a rematch he has no intention of granting. Elsewhere, you have to enjoy the absurdity of those ruling themselves in. Consider Sven\u2011Goran Eriksson, who has convinced himself of his suitability for one last payday more often than the Ocean's Nineteen gang. Or behold Rafa Ben\u00edtez explaining why the Liverpool fans would want him to manage Chelsea. \"Can anybody argue that the Liverpool fans love me?\" he inquired rhetorically. \"If we agree with this, what do you want for someone you love? The best for him! If they love me, they will understand,\" concluded Ben\u00edtez, apparently seeking to conjure a scenario in which the Kop makes like Adele and sings that they wish nothing but the best for someone like him. For Chelsea fans, meanwhile, there are suggestions that only a huge name would stave off the first rumblings of dissent, and Abramovich's itchy trigger finger and Uefa's looming financial fair play regulations conspire to make that a tough order. Of course, the fear must always be that the mysterious stranger who blew in from the cold may almost as suddenly blow out again, and leave them to a fate if not worse than death, then certainly as bad as Ken Bates. But were they to turn on the Russian, has he the temperament to stand for it? The key word with those seeking to illuminate Abramovich's character always seems to be \"control\". We hear of senior club insiders doubling over in laughter at suggestions he might loosen the reins. None of which really indicates an appetite for taking a kicking from fans. But then, as any fule kno, most dictators are terrified of ridicule \u2013 and as indicated, many rich men seem to be the most sensitive souls. In its wake, the QPR documentary drew some telling recollections from managers about the owners and chairmen they've had to deal with. Former Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett recalled how Sam Hammam eventually wanted the right to pick the team, going on to muse: \"Sam used to ask me why the supporters sang: 'There's only one Dave Bassett,' when it was he who had stumped up the money to buy John Fashanu etc.\" Honestly, the injustice of it. As for Abramovich, he may be able to live with the Shed End not singing hymns of praise. But whether he'd be minded to bear vocal criticism for very long is quite another matter.",

      "bodyText": "Northern Broadsides have formed an interesting alliance for one of their main productions next year, by tempting Sir Jonathan Miller back to the theatre stage after a five year gap. The director will take charge of the grand old northern drama Rutherford &amp; Son, which deals with class, capitalism and gender struggles. All three are bubbling nicely in our three regions' contemporary affairs. The play was first performed at the Royal Court theatre in London in 1912 and took the capital by storm, especially when its unknown author K.G.Sowerby turned out to be a woman, and a notably bold and outspoken one. Githa Sowerby (1876-1970) knew exactly what she was writing about, as the child of the wealthiest glass-making family in Gateshead. A strong suffragist and Fabian, she told The Queen magazine at the time: I know the life of hard-working Northerners, and I like writing about things I know. As for technique, well, it's rather alarming, isn't it? I imagined the Rutherfords in a room, not on the stage, by the way. Originally I called the play The Master, but found at the last moment that the title had already been used. So I settled on one of the oldest and best known names in the North \u2013 Rutherford. The storyline sounds a bit like Brass, that epic skit on northern clich\u00e9, but Sowerby was an acute observer of human nature as well as the dynamic of impassioned industrial magnates. She wove both talents together with subtle political campaigning. The suffragist magazine The Vote said of Rutherford and Son: No play has ever been written that in the truest, strongest sense was so really a 'Suffrage' play, although the word is never uttered and the thought never enters the minds of the people portrayed. Miller's career has developed from early work in Beyond the Fringe with Alan Bennett, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore to directing with English National Opera, Glyndebourne and the Royal Shakespear Company. He worked with Broadsides' Barrie Rutter in the 1980s, including the RSC's The Taming of the Shrew in 1987, but has not directed a play since his 2008 production of Hamlet at the Tobacco Factory in Bristol. He directed La Boheme for the English National Opera the following year. He says: I am absolutely thrilled and excited to be asked to direct Rutherford &amp; Son for Northern Broadsides next year. It is also a huge delight to be once again working with Barrie Rutter. Earlier this year Barrie invited me up to Halifax to visit Northern Broadsides' home at the Viaduct Theatre in Halifax and I was totally overcome with the venue's wonderful intimate performance space which is such an exciting challenge and delight for both a director and actor. Rutter, who will play the patriarch John Rutherford, responds with equal enthusiasm: Jonathan's delight in the play and our home venue at Dean Clough, a former mill, is very fitting for the robust domestic and industrial battle that is at the heart of Rutherford &amp; Son. He will be the company's first guest director \u2013 a welcome and exhilarating influence. The production will be designed by Isabella Bywater, a regular colleague of Miller's, and the rest of the cast and tour venues will be announced later this year. The premiere will be at the Viaduct on 8 February next year.",

      "bodyText": "Ofcom has complained to the Dutch media regulator about the content of adult chat channels Babestation and Smile TV, which are licensed in the Netherlands but broadcast to millions of Freeview households in the UK overnight and can be easily accessed by children in their bedrooms. The UK media regulator said that \" this is an important issue, and active discussions are under way\" with Commissariaat voor de Media (Dutch media authority), the country's content licensing body, to see how British audiences can be protected from scenes of near naked women massaging each other's breasts, masturbating and faking orgasms. Babestation and Smile TV broadcast free to air on digital terrestrial TV service Freeview between 10pm and 6am. Adult channels feature in two blocks on the Freeview electronic programme guide, 93-98 and 190-198. Ofcom has previously revoked the broadcast licences of adult pay-TV channels including Tease Me for repeatedly airing material that was too sexually explicit for pre-watershed hours. However, as Babestation and Smile TV are licensed by the Dutch media authority, rather than Ofcom, the UK regulator has no power to block or ban them. The regulator added that it has no tally of the number of complaints received from British viewers about the channels, adding that it advises those offended to approach the Dutch regulator. However, the Mumsnet website has hosted a lively discussion on the issue, which included comments, \"I can't believe they are on when toddlers are up and about\" and \"You switch in and hey, porn\". Caroline Dinenage, Conservative MP for Gosport and member of the parliamentary inquiry into online child protection, said there was an urgent need to address inappropriate television content. \"Some of the images on Freeview may be contravening UK regulation. This is terrestrial TV, free to everyone, including children and teenagers,\" Dinenage added. \"We need to ensure that Freeview operators who sell capacity to non-UK porn channels behave responsibly, and respect UK regulations. There may be a compelling case for Ofcom to withdraw licences from companies selling spectrum to porn channels, without putting in place age restrictive access control.\" The channels could be in breach of UK regulations by promoting websites offering what may be R18 \u2013 the UK classification for hardcore pornography \u2013 content or equivalent, which can be accessed via a premium phone line, requiring no verification of age. Ofcom's rules require any such promotions to be run after midnight. \"If they don't do what we ask them we can go to the European Commission,\" said an Ofcom spokesman. Freeview is owned by broadcasters the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, BSkyB and transmission company Arqiva. A Freeview spokeswoman said it does not decide which channels to broadcast on the service. The DTT multiplex operators decide which channels are broadcast. Babestation and Smile TV use DTT spectrum owned by Arqiva to broadcast on Freeview.* However, a spokesman for Dmol, a company owned by the operators of the six Freeview multiplexes \u2013 the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Arqiva \u2013 said it is about to launch a four-month consultation that is expected to result by the autumn in the adult channels moving towards the end of the Freeview EPG in one block. Each multiplex owner is responsible for a bundle of spectrum via which a number of channels are broadcast. Any spectrum not used for their own channels is leased to other broadcasters. The Dmol spokesman said that the current arrangement was \"not ideal\", with the Dutch-licensed adult chat channels accessible to 90% of about 10.6m UK homes that use Freeview as their only access to digital TV. \"We are conscious of the need to move quickly.

These walks have become a sort of ritual; a mini, personal celebration of spring. The pedant in me ticks off new species that have emerged from winter hibernation, and then I walk back to my air-conditioned office and bore colleagues with my sightings. First I visit the large swathes of crocus, which act like big, purple landing pads for bees. One year I found starving, sleepy bumblebee queens clinging to unopened blooms, willing them to open. Another year it was warm enough to sit among the flowers, watching fat bumblebees, almost completely covered in pollen, rolling around each flower. After the crocuses have finished, the bees (and I) move on to the Berberis julianae. South facing, it traps the sun's warmth, and is a more reliable, early source of food than the crocuses, which are often over before the bees have woken up. There, last week, I spotted my first red-tailed and garden bumbles of 2012. There were lots of bumblebees on the flowers, but there were more on the ground, resting or wandering about lazily, with no apparent purpose. I also spotted several bumblebee bums, sticking out above the leaf litter, wiggling in the midday sun to keep warm. Intrigued, I sat and watched them all for a while. The berberis is planted on a bank, and the soft soil beneath the shrubs is covered in a thick layer of leaf litter. It dawned on me that some of the bees might have spent the winter under the shrubs, and emerged in perfect time to make the short flight (or crawl) to replenish their energy reserves with nectar. Some of those on the ground were perhaps gearing up to making that initial journey. I've only ever seen a bumblebee go into hibernation once. It was on my allotment (incidentally on a south-facing bank), and this mated, daughter queen dug herself into the soil until she disappeared. The rest of the colony will have died a week or so later, leaving her and the other daughter queens from that nest to start a new generation the following year. Not all queens survive winter, but I'm always impressed, each spring, when I see bumblebees that have spent winter without food in a burrow in the ground, enduring autumn rains, snow and ice. They come out, dust themselves off, and just carry on. I'll be paying more attention to the berberis this autumn, in the hope that my theory might be proved and I'll catch sight of another bumble digging its winter burrow. But in the meantime, I'll continue with my spring walks. It's amazing what you can see on your lunch break.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party needs to go further to shed its nasty party image and make itself the natural home of black and ethnic minority candidates, Tory moderniser Francis Maude has said. As Conservative chairman, Maude led a drive to persuade the party that it had to change to become electable and was one of the figures behind the formation of the Policy Exchange thinktank. In a speech on Wednesday marking the thinktank's 10th anniversary, Maude will describe how Policy Exchange has grown from a cottage industry to a colossus bestriding the policy-making stage, providing the intellectual ballast for the party to modernise. Setting out where he believes the party needs to go in the next decade, he says: \"Marx was right \u2013 alienation is a central problem in modern society. For people who do not own feel alienated. They feel dispossessed from any control over their own destiny.\" Setting out his non-Marxist solutions, he calls for a greater spread of ownership, an extension of the right to buy, but also the spread of spinoffs of mutuals from current public sector state-owned organisations. Pointing out that more than \u00a31bn of NHS services are already provided by mutuals, he calls for an end to the imprisoning \"binary choice between public services being delivered by bureaucratic monolithic public sector monopolies on the one hand; and straight outsourcing or privatisation to commercial providers on the other. Mutuals, co-operatives and social enterprises offer ways to provide services well beyond these simplistic opposites.\" He says mutuals \"allow workers to take control of their destiny, having accountability and responsibility for what they do and what they deliver. Mutuals and co-operatives can give workers ownership over their work. And with ownership can end alienation.\" He hails as a major supply side reform his plans for a \"right to provide\" where public sector workers can request to take over the running of services. He points out: \"More than half of every pound of our nation's wealth is spent by the state and while we all know the dangers of private sector monopolies we think all too little about the perils of state monopolies over service provision. The state is an inherently monopolistic entity and a state monopoly can be the enemy of enterprise.\" He said mutuals not only boost productivity \u2013 they will attack \"a general sense of alienation \u2013 which often manifests as apathy. An administered people with no sense of ownership over a government that has become more impenetrable than ever before will feel alienated from the state and from society itself.\" The coalition he will claim is also attacking alienation by making ever more government public, so ending an era of collective ignorance. He says: \"The prize is empowered citizens, rather than administered citizens; citizens who can expose corruption, get the best value out of their governments and have equal access to valuable information. Maude also says the party will legislate for same-sex marriage and urges the party not to try the turn the clock back. He warns: \"The Conservative party will always suffer if it is seen as if it is trying to turn the clock back to an imagined golden era. You can't drive policy looking through a rose-tinted rear-view mirror. If we are seen as being defined by backward-looking social attitudes we will be seen as unacceptable and unelectable.\" He said the party's approach to social issues, including the number of black and ethnic minority candidates, are prerequisites for the party to be seen as a national party representing the cities as well as the countryside and suburbs; a party as much for its non-white citizens as for the white; for women who work and unmarried couples as much as for full time mothers and the married.\" He will say the party has not gone far enough to make itself feel like a natural home for black and ethnic minority candidates. He claims the party has the suppleness to respond to changing social values. \"It is taking governments out of their comfort zone. The future is open. And Conservatives are making transparency a defining characteristic of our future public policy. \"Last autumn we made world-leading commitments to open up more public sector data that will make travel easier and healthcare better, and create significant growth for industry and jobs in the UK. At the heart of what we are doing is building a two-way data relationship between the state and society.\"",

      "bodyText": "The stalemate at Paris fashion week is broken with the appointment of Hedi Slimane as designer for Yves Saint Laurent, replacing the outgoing Stefano Pilati. The return of Slimane has been enthusiastically welcomed by an industry that reveres him as a cult figure. Slimane, 43, has been absent from fashion design since leaving Dior Homme in 2007, and has been pursuing a successful career as a photographer in the US. Slimane and his bosses at PPR, which owns YSL, will be hoping that the comeback can emulate the seismic impact the British designer Phoebe Philo had on fashion in 2009 on returning from a three-year career break. This is a bold appointment by PPR, which suggests it is prepared to take risks in an attempt to restore the YSL label to the forefront of fashion. Slimane has never before designed a womenswear collection, although his men's tailoring had a devoted following among female celebrities and fashion insiders. Slimane, like Yves Saint Laurent himself, is an aesthetic radical. At Dior Homme he replaced the beefcake models who had always peopled the menswear catwalks with pale, skinny young boys in dark, skinny suits, dressed a new generation of young musicians and actors in the clothes, and revolutionised the reigning aesthetic of male beauty. He is also a perfectionist, committed to maintaining creative control over all aspects of his work. It is thought that exploratory talks last year about a possible return to the Dior post vacated by John Galliano were stalled by Slimane's insistence on an expensive refit of all boutiques. With 83 stores worldwide, such an overhaul for YSL would represent a significant financial investment. Slimane has \"total creative responsibility for the brand image and all of its collections\", according to a statement, which said he would continue to pursue his photographic career. It seems very likely that, like Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel, Slimane will shoot future YSL advertising campaigns himself. Slimane worked at YSL for three years between 1997 and 2000, and is believed by many close to the house to have a natural synergy with the spirit of the label. Pilati, the departing designer, is credited with commercial successes that took the label from loss-making to profitability, but never quite convinced the industry that he carried the heart of the brand within his own. The New York Times noted that Pilati's final show on Monday evening was greeted with \"a respectful ovation\" led by his bosses, but that it \"was not an especially moving sendoff\". Paul Deneve, the YSL chief executive, praised Slimane's \"understanding of the spirit of Yves Saint Laurent\" and said he looked forward to \"a promising new chapter in the story of the maison\". Francois-Henri Pinault, PPR chairman and CEO, said the \"formidable potential\" of YSL \"will be successfully harnessed and revealed through the vision of Hedi Slimane\". Slimane's first designs for YSL will be seen when a \"resort\" collection is shown in June.",

At Dior Homme he replaced the beefcake models who had always peopled the menswear catwalks with pale, skinny young boys in dark, skinny suits, dressed a new generation of young musicians and actors in the clothes, and revolutionised the reigning aesthetic of male beauty.</p> <p>He is also a perfectionist, committed to maintaining creative control over all aspects of his work. It is thought that exploratory talks last year about a possible return to the Dior post vacated by John Galliano were stalled by Slimane's insistence on an expensive refit of all boutiques. With 83 stores worldwide, such an overhaul for YSL would represent a significant financial investment.</p> <p>Slimane has \"total creative responsibility for the brand image and all of its collections\", according to a statement, which said he would continue to pursue his photographic career. It seems very likely that, like Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel, Slimane will shoot future YSL advertising campaigns himself.</p> <p>Slimane worked at YSL for three years between 1997 and 2000, and is believed by many close to the house to have a natural synergy with the spirit of the label. Pilati, the departing designer, is credited with commercial successes that took the label from loss-making to profitability, but never quite convinced the industry that he carried the heart of the brand within his own. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/fashion/yves-saint-laurent-chanel-chloe-and-valentino-on-the-paris-runways.html\" title=\"\">New York Times noted</a> that Pilati's final show on Monday evening was greeted with \"a respectful ovation\" led by his bosses, but that it \"was not an especially moving sendoff\".</p> <p>Paul Deneve, the YSL chief executive, praised Slimane's \"understanding of the spirit of Yves Saint Laurent\" and said he looked forward to \"a promising new chapter in the story of the maison\". Francois-Henri Pinault, PPR chairman and CEO, said the \"formidable potential\" of YSL \"will be successfully harnessed and revealed through the vision of Hedi Slimane\".</p> <p>Slimane's first designs for YSL will be seen when a \"resort\" collection is shown in June.</p>",

I am constantly trying to join the dots, to figure out why we're eating croissant in the Congo, why that Inuit is so drunk, whether that marsupial can really be carnivorous. Every detail says something telling about the there and then. I first worked with the journalist AA Gill on a trip to Chad for a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res book. I heard he had a reputation for not getting along with photographers, but we did, famously, and have been working together ever since. People are always quite surprised that neither of us know much about the places we visit. I don't do any in-depth research as I want to be taken by observations, not preconceptions. Our method is relentless: we start the day at sunrise, wandering around the village, cemetery or boardwalk, searching for the crux of a story. I never know what we are looking for until we find it. In this case we were in Albania for six days in 2006. At a park in the capital, Tirana, we passed the odd jogger, lovers on benches and dog-walkers. I had only taken a couple of pictures in as many hours; then we chanced upon this scene and I immediately kicked up a gear. I don't know whether these men were unemployed, had been thrown out of their houses by their wives or were just hanging out. They sat in their undies on torn-up cardboard boxes playing chess and drinking odd concoctions out of plastic bottles. Their skin was that leathery kind you get if you sit in the sun for months on end. It was a moment that seemed to capture the place, and set stories running in my mind. I was thinking about a Georges Seurat's Bathers at Asni\u00e8res and a snap by Henri Cartier-Bresson. I wished I could speak Albanian, so I could settle down and shoot the breeze.

In my experience, PRs have not lied but several of them have been extremely economical with the truth. And some have spun negatives into positives with a breathtakingly cavalier attitude towards the reality. Then again, as my PR friends (very few, but they do exist) like to say: we're amateurs in the spinning game compared to newspapers. Touch\u00e9. The difference, I respond, is that they are the gatekeepers of knowledge and information while we journalists are in the disclosure business. And we might even spin a little less if they were more forthcoming (well, up to a point, Lord Copper). The truth, as we who try to discover it know only too well, is a moving target. And our chances of hitting the bullseye with a single shot are remote, especially when PRs do their best to obfuscate. It is a daily difficulty for many reporters to extract something approximating to the truth from a group of professionals employed specifically to prevent the truth emerging in public. PRs very often tend to get in the way. I've lost count of the times I've called a PR, asked a question he/she cannot answer, and then waited hours for a call-back. The answer inevitably prompts a supplementary question and the waiting game begins all over again. I started in journalism in 1963 when there were hardly any PRs around. It was so much simpler then, though it's also fair to say that secrecy - the British disease - did ensure that we learned very little anyway. Nothing has changed at the top, incidentally. As Ponsford points out, horsegate illustrated yet again how difficult it can be to get Downing Street's official spokesman to answer a straightforward question with a straightforward answer. So, have you been lied to? NB: I wish I didn't have to say this to journalists but, if you do decide to comment, please do keep the law of libel in mind. Source: Press Gazette",

      "bodyText": "London truly is a serendipity engine - a theme nicely addressed by Lenny Rachitsky in his TEDxConcordia talk which bewails the way that tools such as Amazon and Google learn our tastes and increasingly starve us of serendipity. A couple of decades ago, I used to say that SustainAbility had three key critical global advantages: its name; the emergence of English as the international language of business; and London, particularly Heathrow as a portal to the rest of the world. And all that was brought back to mind last week when I walked into Generation Investment Management's offices in Piccadilly. That same morning, I received an email asking me to draft a list of people to invite to SustainAbility's 25th anniversary event in London on 30 April. I began casting back over the decades, recalling many of the people who had passed through our offices. One person who came to mind from the very early years was Toronto-based Nick Parker, who coined the term cleantech and founded the Cleantech Group. Now Chairman of a Canadian state corporation, I put him on the list. Then, as a couple of us walked into Generation's glass-walled offices a few hours later, there he was \u2013 talking to the person we were about to meet. Within minutes we had caught up and agreed that he would come to the April event. And my mind was primed to think about cleantech when, later the same day, a spontaneous email came through from the Cleantech Group, inviting me to download their latest report, Coming Clean. The title caught my eye partly because we had used it for SustainAbility's first report on corporate environmental reporting, way back in 1993. But I was also interested because I have been increasingly involved in the cleantech world over the past decade \u2013 and because WWF, with which I have now had a 50-year history, is a partner in the Global Cleantech Innovation Index project. With the Green Economy story now central to thinking about how we build and fuel what we have dubbed the Phoenix Economy, I am fascinated to see how indexing, ranking and rating schemes can help spur government and political ambitions. So, having downloaded the report, the first thing was to get a sense of who is currently doing best in cleantech. Who is providing the best conditions for clean technology startup creation? The answer won't come as a huge surprise to anyone tracking the field: the leading country in the 2012 index is Denmark, followed by Israel, Sweden, Finland and the US, with companies in the Asia Pacific region following closely behind when it comes to commercial success. A total of 38 countries were evaluated on 15 indicators related to the creation and commercialisation of cleantech startups. This generated an index that measured each one's potential, relative to their economic size, to produce entrepreneurial cleantech startup companies and commercialise clean technology innovations over the next decade. Richard Youngman, the Cleantech Group's managing director for Europe and Aisa stressed: \"The global macro-economic landscape is shifting; fostering entrepreneurial start-ups and growth companies with clean technology solutions will be an increasingly important part of countries' competitiveness on the world stage.\" Strikingly, the four top-scoring countries all have small economies. But while they are the source of much innovation, the authors underscore the uncomfortable fact that \"they have less ability to scale-up companies\". As a result, \"these small countries need innovative approaches and collaboration to compensate for the lack of large domestic markets and inconsistent availability of finance throughout a company's life-cycle\". \"The overwhelming majority of capital required for making the transition to a low-carbon future will come from a variety of private sources,\" said Samantha Smith, leader of WWF's Global Climate and Energy Initiative. \"Developing a working recipe for strengthening the flow of public-private finance towards early as well as later-stage cleantech is key for countries that want to taste the economic success of cleantech.\" North America and northern Europe are still the primary contributors to the development of innovative cleantech companies. The US placed fifth in the Index, its team notes. \"However in absolute terms, without factoring in economic size, the United States leads in many measures of cleantech innovation: the country has the greatest public cleantech R&amp;D budget, the greatest number of cleantech startups and investors, as well as the most venture capital, private equity, and M&amp;A deals in cleantech.\" And what about the Asia Pacific region? It performs well in relation to scaling up entrepreneurial cleantech companies and to wider commercial success and revenue creation. Indeed, while currently producing fewer cleantech startups and placing 13th, China now leads in cleantech manufacturing, is strong in early-stage growth, and shows considerable potential to produce more early stage innovation in the future. Among other things, China has been home to the majority of cleantech IPOs since 2009, many of which listed on the recently established ChiNext board of the Shenzhen stock exchange. Similarly, India scores 12th in the 2012 Index, but is performing well in fund raising for cleantech-focused initiatives, and has significant activity under way in later stage cleantech companies. As the Cleantech Group concludes: \"While climate change negotiations may prevaricate market forces do not. Every day, from Amsterdam to Zhongguancun, a new cleantech company is being founded or invested in, setting out on its own journey to make its contribution to that sustainability revolution.\" The key to progress at the national level is to create the ecosystems necessary to enable innovation, enterprise and scaling. Nick Parker, for example, is now working to help late-stage entrepreneurial ventures break into the Asian market. Critically, a key conclusion of the survey is that \"completely new science and technology breakthrough companies are rare, though they do exist\". My conclusion: in pushing towards our TEDxThames conference on Breakthrough Capitalism, we must focus both on incremental and transformative, systemic change \u2013 but with a focus on the latter. As I have argued elsewhere, it's time to punctuate some equilibriums.

      "bodyText": "Each week we invite a reader to share a playlist of songs they've been listening to recently. This week it's Anne Scott, who says: \"I am a middle aged woman. Since the 1960s I have loved music. I can still enjoy the music I liked as a wee girl, and from several points along my lifetime so far. Unlike most men I know (sorry), the music of my late teens/early 20s does little for me. I prefer the music I failed to listen to in the late 70s/early 80s, rather than the records I bought. Music's past informs my current taste; music history fills my iTunes, not my iPod. I give most genres/musicians a listen. I am too old now to waste time on things I don't like, or to listen to music I've heard numerous times. Nice if it pops up sometimes, but there's plenty of new material to try. For a couple of years, I've found myself most interested in new hiphop artists. Hiphop has been in danger of becoming a nostalgia genre. Golden Age reminiscences, complaints about Gangster Rap, as if that sub-genre were relevant to 2012, kids at school being taught \"rapping\" in English classes. The impression is of a dying art form. May I put the case for the defence?\" Rapsody \u2013 The Autobiography of M Evans Female MCs have not always been great. They have often tried to out-curse and out-brag the men. Or they quickly find the money available in hip-pop. Miss Evans is neither of the aforementioned. She is smart, lyrical, confident. Most of her work is available free. I await her first performances in the UK. The Roots \u2013 Walk Alone Never huge, never rich, The Roots work hard. All their albums are good. This excellent track from \"How I Got Over\" was performed at the Grammy Jam Session a few days ago. Their recent album Undun is a concept album, anachronistic as that may seem. Yelawolf \u2013 Made in the USA A white skateboarder from Alabama is not the typical rapper. But white kids have grown up with hiphop since the 80s. Yelawolf is also influenced by his mother's rock LPs, so he has a unique style. \"Made in the USA\" sounds a bit pop, but the lyrics are hard. Yelawolf knows about poor housing, eviction, American poverty. Brother Ali \u2013 Shine On Brother Ali is a white man, born with albinism. Bullied by white kids at school for his appearance, he had an affinity with the black students. Not all his material is excellent, but his voice is extraordinary. He sings, raps, chants. Brother Ali is that clich\u00e9 who could read the telephone directory. Evidence \u2013 You Evidence, of LA group Dilated Peoples, is another artist outside the stereotype. His parents are Italian and Russian. He has been a graffiti artist. The video is fun to watch. Elzhi \u2013 It Ain't Hard to Tell From the album \"Elmatic\", a re-interpretation of Nas' 1994 release, Illmatic. Elzhi uses the ingredients of the classic LP and makes it 2011/Detroit. Elmatic is what I like in a cover version from any genre. It is interpretive, not imitative. Das Racist \u2013 All Tan Everything Das Racist could be mistaken for a novelty act. Almost stream of consciousness, word associations I wish I'd thought of, All Tan Everything says \"glad not to be white\". Lyrically witty, politically aware, their albums are full of references to songs from many genres and eras. And they know their name will offend people. The albums \"Sit Down, Man\" and \"Shut Up, Dude\" are free releases. Lupe Fiasco \u2013 All Black Evrything I had to add this. Imagine Africans had gone to America as employees, not slaves. Lupe Fiasco's \"dream\" variously involves \"black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan\"; \"Ahmedinijad wins Mandela peace prize\"; \"Somalia is a great place to relax in\". And I love his accent as he rhymes \"50 Cent\" with \"Michigan\". What do you think of Anne's selection? Any standout tracks? Let us know in the thread below, and tell us about the songs you've had on repeat this week. \u2022 Interested in submitting a playlist? Email adam.boult@guardian.co.uk with the subject line \"Now listening\" and tell us who you are, and one or two tracks you'd include.",

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Franzen, no friend to the rapid onward march of technology, has now turned his ire on Twitter, reportedly describing the microblogging site as \"unspeakably irritating\" at a book reading. The author Jami Attenberg was at a talk given by Franzen at Tulane University in New Orleans on 5 March, and took notes on some of the novelist's comments. After dismissing the ending of Revolutionary Road as \"falsely bleak\" and telling his audience that \"there's something goofy about American literature since modernism came to an end\", the celebrated author of Freedom and The Corrections moved on to social media. \"Twitter is unspeakably irritating. Twitter stands for everything I oppose,\" said Franzen, according to Attenberg. \"It's hard to cite facts or create an argument in 140 characters \u2026 It's like if Kafka had decided to make a video semaphoring The Metamorphosis. Or it's like writing a novel without the letter 'P'\u2026 It's the ultimate irresponsible medium. People I care about are readers \u2026 particularly serious readers and writers, these are my people. And we do not like to yak about ourselves.\" Far from prompting a mass Twitter exodus, however, Franzen's reported comments gave rise to the hashtag #JonathanFranzenhates on the website. According to tweeters' yakking, the novelist hates everything from \"Emoticons, because it takes 600 pages to accurately convey emotion\", to puppies, people who hate Jar Jar Binks, and cameras, because \"real pictures should be painted\". Attenberg said she was \"sort of infuriated\" by Franzen's comments about Twitter. \"Not that he's incorrect about how much social networking can suck your time, because it can, but because he doesn't understand that a lot of writers have to use the medium as a promotional device as well as a way to build networks,\" she explained. Franzen, she said, \"doesn't have to do anything! He has a publicist who probably has dreams about him every night, whether he has a book coming out or not. He is free to write and just be himself, while the rest of us are struggling to be heard and recognised. He will never understand how hard it is to get ahead as a writer, never again in his life. I'm not suggesting he's old-fashioned. I'm suggesting he has lost perspective.\" Franzen, who avoids the internet while he writes, has previously laid out his reasons for disliking ebooks: reading a book on a screen feels too impermanent, he believes, and he worries \"that it's going to be very hard to make the world work if there's no permanence like that. That kind of radical contingency is not compatible with a system of justice or responsible self-government.\" Admitted Franzen: \"Very probably, you're sick to death of hearing social media disrespected by cranky 51-year-olds.\" But last year he also criticised Facebook, where, he said, \"we star in our own movies, we photograph ourselves incessantly, we click the mouse and a machine confirms our sense of mastery. And, since our technology is really just an extension of ourselves, we don't have to have contempt for its manipulability in the way we might with actual people. It's all one big endless loop. We like the mirror and the mirror likes us. To friend a person is merely to include the person in our private hall of flattering mirrors.\" The #JonathanFranzenhates hashtag is unlikely to persuade the novelist of social media's benefits.

Pavitt told the public sector efficiency expo in London that HMRC that the cuts had not come at the expense of quality of service. \"This year it was just under \u00a3700m, and by the end of the spending review it will be just over \u00a3600. And yet the service quality has dramatically improved, not measured by me, but measured by the speaker after me [Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor general at the National Audit Office],\" he said. HMRC has been critcised in the past for problems with delivery of IT projects, and major system errors that saw millions of people paying too much tax. Pavitt told the audience that, although the authority faces huge challenges, but it is working hard to become more efficient, including by getting incumbent suppliers to match competitors' lower quotes and generally being smarter about buying applications. In the case of customer relationship management (CRM) software, Pavitt told the audience that the authority had 31 platforms in place two years ago, but that number has now been whittled down to one. \"We identified one of those and said, 'Okay, we're going to migrate to that. Whatever that one is we're also going to modernise to the latest version,' which we perhaps hadn't always had in every part of our business,\" he said. To keep the costs of such a process down, HMRC has a commercial arrangement whereby one supplier performs the migration and then the upgrade - all done with no capital investment from the authority, Pavitt said. \"The cost of the new platform is much cheaper than the running and the maintenance of the old platform. Freeing up and reinvesting that money means we'll replace every single application - two-thirds of our infrastructure - in the next four years for the outlay of less than \u00a320m, when the original bill was closer to \u00a3200m. Not a pipe dream, but a commercial reality.\" HMRC has also been working on improving IT that underpins its call centres, according to the CIO. \"If you have call centres attracting a large number of calls, but their IT is not available for 120 to 150 minutes a week, that introduces a level of inefficiency. If you have call centres whose IT is a 100% month after month, inevitably you give the business a chance to improve their operation, which they have done, to meet the need of the customer,\" said Pavitt. \"IT transformation, which foreruns some of the bigger transformations at HMRC, was critical to get right.\" This article is published by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "Seven Algerian nationals suspected of terrorism have resisted attempts to deport them by turning the tables on the government's support for using secret evidence in court. In a complex judgment affecting the procedures of the special immigration appeals commission (Siac), the supreme court dismissed the home secretary's objection to material being presented that could not be tested in a hearing. Five justices at the supreme court, including the president, Lord Phillips, unanimously allowed the appeals of the Algerians, who fear they will be tortured if returned to north Africa. The Algerians wanted to bring in a witness, referred to as W, who would present evidence about the risk of ill-treatment in Algeria, contradicting official assurances from the country's government. However, W was only prepared to appear if his identity and evidence remained \"absolutely and irrevocably confidential\". Siac, which deals with security-sensitive immigration and deportation cases, has for the past 15 years operated a system of \"closed material procedures\" in which a judge can be presented with evidence that may not be seen by the claimant or communicated further. Ken Clarke, the justice secretary, is proposing to extend the use of such procedures into the civil courts in the face of strong opposition from civil liberties groups. They have warned that evidence presented to court that has not been subject to cross-examination or otherwise tested cannot be trusted to be accurate or true. In the case of the seven Algerians, lawyers for the home secretary, Theresa May, were forced to deploy an identical argument. The supreme court judgment noted that one of the government's points was that \"so far as the conduct of the [Siac] appeals is concerned, the ability of the secretary of state to participate in them effectively may be seriously undermined by an irrevocable non-disclosure order \u2026 the secretary of state will be denied the ability to test the reasons or to obtain information and/or adduce evidence from or with the assistance of the Algerian authorities to demonstrate that the asserted reasons for the claim to confidentiality are groundless.\" Home Office lawyers also argued that the secretary of state could find herself in possession of information pointing to the existence of a terrorist threat abroad or some other risk to national security, yet be unable to alert the foreign state to the risk. This, it was alleged, could gravely imperil future diplomatic relations. Agreeing that Siac could make an irrevocable non-disclosure order, allowing witness W to give evidence in the deportation proceedings, Lord Dyson acknowledged that it was not an ideal solution. \"I accept that to make such an order is a striking step for any court to take and is contrary to the instincts of any common lawyer,\" he said. \"It is inimical to the fundamental principles which we rightly cherish of open justice and, above all, procedural fairness. \"To make an order without giving the secretary of state an opportunity to be heard is a clear breach of the principles of natural justice. Any such order requires compelling justification. Regrettably, however, the circumstances of a case sometimes call for unusual and undesirable remedies.\" The court also ruled that \"it must surely be a substantial defence to any diplomatic complaint\" by a foreign country that ministers were obliged to comply with a \"final and absolute\" court order. Whether the Algerians will ultimately be deported depends upon the immigration tribunal's future finding. In his written judgment, Lord Brown pointed out: \"It must, of course, now be for Siac to consider what, if any, impact our decision has upon the outcome of these appellants' individual appeals: whether there is a need now to reopen them and what, if any, orders should now be made.\" Commenting on the decision, David Davis, the former shadow home secretary who is a fierce critic of proposals to extend the secret justice system said: \"The government doesn't like it when it can't itself challenge evidence, as unchallenged evidence is unreliable evidence. This shows that one-sided justice eventually delivers no justice.\" A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"This judgment is based on a narrow point of legal process and does not change our intention to seek the deportation of these men as soon as possible because they remain a national security risk.\"",

Thousands of nurses, midwives, doctors, physiotherapists, cleaners, porters and other NHS workers are expected to attend a \"Save our NHS\" rally this evening at Westminster.

Clark, who has cerebral palsy, tells how he was invited in 2006 to appear at a Conservative party event (\"presumably to make [Cameron] look more 'diverse',\" he says), but was offered neither a fee nor travel expenses. He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I emailed back my agent at the time, saying I'd still do it anyway as \u2013 and these were my exact words \u2013 it was \"a golden opportunity to piss off the Tories.\" But just as I hit the 'Send' button, I felt a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. This was down to my sudden realisation that I'd accidentally selected 'Reply to All' and directly emailed Tory Party HQ too. Needless to say, I got a swift response saying my services were no longer required.

      "bodyText": "He may have only just released Jack and Jill (Tagline: \"Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler and Adam Sandler is also Adam Sandler's sister, plus something about Al Pacino\"), but that doesn't mean that Adam Sandler is resting on his laurels. Far from it. In just a few short months he'll release yet another comedy, entitled That's My Boy. In That's My Boy, Sandler plays someone's dad. That's probably all you need to know. It's an Adam Sandler film, so it doesn't take a genius to work out what'll happen in it. First he'll be loud and boorish. Then he'll learn to reconnect with his son, probably with the aid of a magical remote control or a breakdancing guinea pig or something. And then at the end he'll cry. This is what will happen in That's My Boy, because this is what happens in pretty much all Adam Sandler films. But, just to rubber-stamp this theory, let's pick through the new trailer for That's My Boy anyway \u2026 1) So far, so predictable. Here's Sandler being as boorish as possible. He's simultaneously smoking a cigar, wearing sunglasses at night, bellowing into a phone and sitting in a hot tub surrounded by bikini-clad girls. This is how all Adam Sandler films begin, with the possible exception of Spanglish. 2) However, Sandler's free and easy lifestyle is disrupted when he's told that \u2026 oh, it doesn't matter. This is basically the scene in the film where he gets to do his \"WHAAAA?\" face. 3) Whatever caused him to do his \"WHAAAA?\" face has prompted Sandler to repair his relationship with his son. He's reading a newspaper, so let's assume that it's a magical newspaper where whatever Sandler writes will come true in real life, or that he'll get to act out all sorts of crazy old-timey news stories or something. 4) Alternatively, Sandler could just walk to his son's house and do a \"WAZZZUP!\" face at him. But who is Sandler's son? If history is any indication, it's either an adorably precocious young stage-school brat who also happens to be wise beyond his years, or it's Sandler himself dressed up like some kind of horrific toddler. 5) Oh, it's Andy Samburg. That's disappointing. But at least now we know who Sandler's son is, we can skip to the bit where Sandler reconnects with him. 6) Except \u2013 oh dear \u2013 it's not going as well as could be expected. Look, he's spitting something out of his mouth, and Samburg looks disappointed. This isn't how it's supposed to go. 7) And now everyone's a strip club? I'm not sure this is an Adam Sandler film at all, you know. It hasn't got overly sentimental, he's doing a poor job of reconnecting with his son and we haven't seen anything remotely magical yet, let alone a breakdancing guinea pig. This is disappointing. 8) Then Sandler forces Samburg to shotgun beer in a supermarket. I don't think I've ever felt so let down. Except, wait. Is that? Could it be? 9) It is! It's Vanilla Ice! Thank God, we're back on track. He might have forgotten the family-friendly shenanigans and the magic and the overbaked sincerity, but Sandler has realised that it's not an Adam Sandler film unless there's a cameo from a celebrity who you end up feeling sorry for. There's hope for That's My Boy yet! Now for the emotional denouement where Sandler cries. 10) Wait. This isn't a graceful denouement at all. Sandler and Samburg are running away from a man with a gun. And I appear to be the one who's crying. Something's gone terribly wrong here.",

Far from it. In just a few short months he'll release yet another comedy, entitled That's My Boy.</p> <p>In That's My Boy, Sandler plays someone's dad. That's probably all you need to know. It's an Adam Sandler film, so it doesn't take a genius to work out what'll happen in it. First he'll be loud and boorish. Then he'll learn to reconnect with his son, probably with the aid of a magical remote control or a breakdancing guinea pig or something. And then at the end he'll cry. This is what will happen in That's My Boy, because this is what happens in pretty much all Adam Sandler films. But, just to rubber-stamp this theory, let's pick through the new trailer for That's My Boy anyway \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387021302\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331115094923/Thats-My-Boy-trailer---Ad-007.jpg\" alt=\"That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1.jpg That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1)</strong> So far, so predictable. Here's Sandler being as boorish as possible. He's simultaneously smoking a cigar, wearing sunglasses at night, bellowing into a phone and sitting in a hot tub surrounded by bikini-clad girls. This is how all Adam Sandler films begin, with the possible exception of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/104562/spanglish\" title=\"\">Spanglish</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387021303\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331115184842/Thats-My-Boy-trailer---Ad-007.jpg\" alt=\"That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2.jpg That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2)</strong> However, Sandler's free and easy lifestyle is disrupted when he's told that \u2026 oh, it doesn't matter. This is basically the scene in the film where he gets to do his \"WHAAAA?\" face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387021304\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331115236212/Thats-My-Boy-trailer---Ad-007.jpg\" alt=\"That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">3.jpg That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3)</strong> Whatever caused him to do his \"WHAAAA?\" face has prompted Sandler to repair his relationship with his son. He's reading a newspaper, so let's assume that it's a magical newspaper where whatever Sandler writes will come true in real life, or that he'll get to act out all sorts of crazy old-timey news stories or something.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387021305\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331115284621/Thats-My-Boy-trailer---Ad-007.jpg\" alt=\"That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">4.jpg That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4)</strong> Alternatively, Sandler could just walk to his son's house and do a \"WAZZZUP!\" face at him. But who is Sandler's son? If history is any indication, it's either an adorably precocious young stage-school brat who also happens to be wise beyond his years, or it's Sandler himself dressed up like some kind of horrific toddler.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387021306\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331115334222/Thats-My-Boy-trailer---Ad-007.jpg\" alt=\"That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">5.jpg That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5)</strong> Oh, it's Andy Samburg. That's disappointing. But at least now we know who Sandler's son is, we can skip to the bit where Sandler reconnects with him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387021307\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331115389858/Thats-My-Boy-trailer---Ad-007.jpg\" alt=\"That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">6.jpg That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6)</strong> Except \u2013 oh dear \u2013 it's not going as well as could be expected.

I'm not sure this is an Adam Sandler film at all, you know. It hasn't got overly sentimental, he's doing a poor job of reconnecting with his son and we haven't seen anything remotely magical yet, let alone a breakdancing guinea pig. This is disappointing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387021309\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331115498455/Thats-My-Boy-trailer---Ad-007.jpg\" alt=\"That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">8.jpg That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>8)</strong> Then Sandler forces Samburg to shotgun beer in a supermarket.

Could it be?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387021310\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331115551358/Thats-My-Boy-trailer---Ad-007.jpg\" alt=\"That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">9.jpg That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>9)</strong> It is! It's Vanilla Ice! Thank God, we're back on track. He might have forgotten the family-friendly shenanigans and the magic and the overbaked sincerity, but Sandler has realised that it's not an Adam Sandler film unless there's a cameo from a celebrity who you end up feeling sorry for. There's hope for That's My Boy yet! Now for the emotional denouement where Sandler cries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387021311\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331115616854/Thats-My-Boy-trailer---Ad-007.jpg\" alt=\"That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10.jpg That's My Boy trailer - Adam Sandler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>10)</strong> Wait.

      "bodyText": "THE TWILIGHT SAGA Introspection is not something one normally associates with Mark Boucher but this week the most-capped wicketkeeper in Test history has been unusually forthcoming about the anxiety he is suffering as his career draws to an end. After 144 Tests in which his demeanour has epitomised the South African Test cricketer \u2013 game, energetic, vociferous and uncharitable \u2013 he has seemed impervious to criticism. Of course, he looked hopelessly deflated when he dropped Nasser Hussain on 23 in the second innings of the 1998 Trent Bridge Test during the great Mike Atherton-Allan Donald duel. When Donald screamed in frustration Boucher blanched in mortification, his expression more guilty than sheepish. Rarely has someone looked so crestfallen and, given England's perilous position, rarely has the Spin found something so hilarious. To Donald's great credit, though, before he began his next over he walked up to the 22-year-old Boucher and patted him on the backside. England went on to win the Test and the series and soon enough South Africa's aggravation at the life Atherton was given by the umpire Steve Dunne, when Boucher had clinched the \"catch\" off the opener's glove, eclipsed any condemnation of the young wicketkeeper. If criticism was muted for Boucher's drop at Nottingham, it has intensified over the past year. The retirement dilemma for any player who has enjoyed a career of such longevity is whether to jump before you're pushed or to persevere for as long as you can. When brashness and unsentimentality have been hallmarks of your approach then logic suggests you would recognise that you may one day become a victim of a similar philosophy. Yet the very quality that makes elite sportsmen consider themselves exceptional is their uncompromising capacity for confidence in their ability, sometimes akin to self-delusion. Now, though, Boucher seems suddenly vulnerable and reflective. He scored only 20 in three innings during the two Tests against Australia in November and, although he made 65 against Sri Lanka at Centurion, his errors in the New Year Cape Town Test provided ammunition for his critics. \"I dropped two sitters that I should have taken, and I probably would take every day of the week, but that's what pressure and lack of confidence does to you,\" he told Cricinfo's Firdoose Moonda. \"A couple of other things creep into your head that shouldn't really be there, like what people are saying about you. You've got to take that stuff and hide it as best as you can. It gets to you mentally and that drags on to you physically as well. You keep trying so hard and you find yourself almost sinking. The harder you try, the deeper you go down.\" Such soul searching contradicts the public perception of Boucher but it mirrors the uncharacteristic uncertainty that other players with more than 100 caps felt besieged by as the end of their careers drew closer. In his autobiography Steve Waugh wrote about his reaction at being dropped from Australia's one-day team, saying: \"I let all my pent-up emotions gush out and bawled like a baby.\" Emotional candour seems to be a coping mechanism when even the toughest feel their prestige and self-esteem threatened. It is interesting that Boucher mentions \"what people are saying about you\" as a cause of his disquiet. It is obvious that he is not referring to the barbs thrown at him by opposition supporters but during three tours of England he probably got up the Spin's nose more than any other player. Being an irritant and a wicketkeeper can be a profitable combination, their incessant blather galvanising the fielding side and their pugnacious spirit signalling that the batsmen are in a fight. Ian Healy was his model and at times Boucher's charmless chirping and sledging were disproportionately tasteless and repetitive, bordering on harassment of the batsman and based on the premise that mental interference led to mental disintegration. But it is not difficult to understand the admiration felt by hard-nosed players such as Nasser Hussain for the feistiness that Boucher's behaviour symbolised. Relentless cheerleading and provocation, however, only take you so far and without the talent to back it up Boucher would not have played 144 Tests of a possible 147 since his debut. As well as his record number of caps, he is also the most prolific wicketkeeper in Test history with 544 dismissals. He became exceptionally sound behind the stumps and equally effective as a batsman. Twice when England supporters were willing him to get out \u2013 at Kingsmead in 1999 when he joined Gary Kirsten with South Africa four down in their second innings following on and only 34 ahead and at Edgbaston nine years later when his side were five wickets down needing 110 to win \u2013 his battling spirit, obduracy and sharp running broke their hearts. He was just as busy in one-day cricket but more fluent and his mettle saw South Africa home with a four to the long-on boundary when they chased down Australia's 434 at Johannesburg in 2006 with the last pair at the crease. Boucher won his 145th cap on Wednesday and was run out for four in Dunedin. Two more in New Zealand then three on what he hopes will be his fourth and final tour of England this summer will take him to 150 when, he says, he will retire. He will never win a popularity contest but, as Hussain wrote, \"he is a tough competitor, the sort of bloke you want on your side\". The Spin will never warm to him but when he goes it would be churlish not to recognise that his record has been outstanding. \u2022 This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian's free weekly cricket email.

But it cannot make you engaging, compelling or authentic. In short, it can't buy you love. And as Mitt Romney keeps showing, week after week, if the voters don't really like you, then you just have to spend as much money as you can making sure they don't like anybody else either. Of the ten states that voted on Super Tuesday, Romney won six and bagged the most delegates. Ordinarily, that would be a great night. Until you realise that Newt Gingrich (who wants to build a colony on the moon) won one, Georgia; and Rick Santorum (who is against contraception) got three, Tennessee, North Dakota and Oklahoma. The totemic prize of Ohio went down to the wire. This is a weak field with little money and fewer smarts. The fact that the Romney campaign eked out narrow victories in crucial places is cause for relief in his camp \u2013 and concern within the Republican hierarchy \u2013 but not elation. It's like England in the last game of the 2010 World Cup soccer qualifiers, when they had to pray for victory against Slovenia and that Algeria didn't score a hatful of goals against the US. True, they eventually qualified. But in doing so, they laid bare their frailties and were roundly defeated in the next round. Given the competition, the fact that the Romney campaign is planning for a long-drawnout delegate fight is a bit like Italy aiming to get through their regional qualifiers on goal difference. Romney should not be winning by \"enough\"; he should be winning by a lot. And so, the Republican primary race dragged on Tuesday night, with talking heads and desperate anchors providing running commentary on an open sore. Romney, yet again, failed to seal the deal on the nomination, and no other candidate presented themselves as a viable alternative. The six states that Romney took included Massachusetts (where he lives), Vermont (the state next door) and Virginia (where neither Gingrich nor Santorum had got it together to be on the ballot), as well as Alaska, Idaho and Ohio. The latter was the one he had to win, and his victory there followed a familiar trend. He entered the last leg, trailing. Having seen in him in debates and maybe on the stump, voters go in search of an alternative. Any alternative. And then comes the money: millions of it pouring in to TV and radio stations, mostly trashing his opponents. Romney outspent Santorum in Ohio four to one. Add that to a superior organisation, a divided opposition, a roll-out of high-level endorsements (including Barbara Bush), and Romney squeaked home on the day by less than 1%. The fact that he has won the most delegates is significant, but not sufficient. Primaries are not simply a means to get the best headcount, come the convention. They are supposed to introduce a candidate to the base so that the nominee can build a coalition to rally the party for the general election. Romney's candidacy is, if anything, doing the opposite. He was far stronger when everyone assumed he would win than he is now when he is actually winning. Once again, Tuesday night, Romney won the rich and the well-educated and lost the party's base, white working-class, non college-educated men. The more likely you were to vote Romney, the more likely you were to have reservations about your choice of candidate. All of this will get worse before it gets better. The next week will see votes in Mississippi, Alabama (southern states where he's likely to lose) and Kansas (a midwestern one where he may well struggle). True, he took Florida, but Gingrich won the panhandle (the southern region). Other than there, Romney has yet to win a single state in the South that was seriously contested, or struggle to more than a narrow victory in the Midwest, including Michigan, the state where he was born and raised. The first is the region of the Republican heartland; the second is the region where much of the election will be decided. And the longer the contest goes on, the more entrenched becomes the framing of him as an ineffectual candidate who is identified with elites. Gingrich referred to him during his victory speech as \"Wall Street\". Not \"like Wall Street\". Just \"Wall Street\". It was not a great night for the other candidates, either. Gingrich has stayed in on the dubious grounds that if he won his home state, he can win the country. Santorum has now proved that he is both a contender \u2013 winning Tennessee by double digits, in particular, was impressive \u2013 but not in serious contention. After losing Michigan, he needed to win Ohio to lay claim to the Midwest and the Reagan Democrats. His failure to do so indicates that while he can wound Romney, he lacks the capacity to land a fatal blow. So, once again, Romney wins the elections and loses the narrative. The frontrunner who has the best coaches, agents and sneakers money can buy has to keep looking over his shoulder because he cannot get into his stride.

      "bodyText": "Speculation is mounting ahead of Apple's iPad announcement later on Wednesday that it will include some sort of haptic technology - thinking which has been driven by the including of the words \"And touch\" in its invitation. The suspicion is that the company which has provided the technology is Senseg, a Finnish startup whose executives have in the past few days become increasingly reticent about discussing any contact that they might or might not have with Apple. So what is the company, and how does its technology work - and might we seen be seeing it in all sorts of devices? In the office Senseg's team works out of a small suite of offices on a floor in one of Helsinki's high-tech buildings. When I went to see them there was snow on the ground - it was January, and a storm had momentarily inconvenienced the city. But the products on show more than made up for it. Senseg has what seems like a breakthrough in \"haptic\" feedback - those which give the sensation of touch without using anything physical. Their demonstration tablet, an unnamed Android one, has a screen which looks and, initially, feels completely normal: smooth and glassy. Then the demonstration starts running. First it shows what looks like a circular channel in the screen, with a couple of balls in it. Touch the screen, and you can push them around the channel. The sensation is peculiar yet convincing: even with your eyes closed, your fingers are convinced there's something there, that you're pushing a physical object. They call the technology \"E-Sense\". Another demo divides the screen into four areas. Put your fingers on them, and in one you feel ridges; in another, a sand-rough texture; in another, a more bumpy texture; in yet another, a more cloth-like feel. I identified them all first time - which clearly pleased Ville Makinen, co-founder and chief technology officer. Just in case you're wondering - yes, it is covered by patents, including the US. (They've also patented a version for steering a vehicle and general application. (\"And we have several more in the pipeline,\" adds Petri Jehkonen, the technical marketing manager.) Senseg was founded in 2008, but the idea for the technology grew out of medical technology studies that Makinen did for his PhD in cognitive science, examining how we perceive stimuli, and the body's reaction and interaction with electric fields. Forceful moves The technology uses the Coulomb force - the one which means you can rub a balloon against your hair and get it to stick. If you have two (fairly) nonconductive objects and you create a charge difference between them, there will be a measurable electrostatic force pulling them together. (When you rub the balloon on your head, electrons transfer from your hair, leaving your hair slightly positively charged, and the balloon negatively charged. Opposite charges then attract.) In the case of Senseg and the tablets, the effect is generated by high-voltage electric fields effectively running in a grid across its surface. (The grid is actually embedded underneath the surface during the manufacturing process.) \"The Coulomb force pulls the finger towards the surface,\" says Makinen. \"Humans are basically large conductive objects. We use a high voltage - about one kilovolt - but zero current.\" That means it's completely safe: despite what signs by electricity pylons say, it's current, not high voltage per se, that kills. However, static forces are very weak, and so very difficult for humans to feel. So making the fields tangible requires an extra step. \"We modelled systems to create frequencies that the hand is particularly sensitive to,\" he says. Turning the electric field on and off at between 10Hz and 1KHz (Senseg keeps the figure a trade secret), alerts the sense of touch: \"it's effectively a modulation of the friction of the screen.\" At its strongest, \"we can make a finger stick and almost stop.\" But, he adds, \"that might not be a pleasant feeling.\" Development has taken some time, but venture capital investors include the founders of Skype and the Finnish government. \"We had the technology before there were tablets,\" explains Makinen. \"And then a clearer use in touch screens emerged. There's a huge need but we weren't ready. But there was a demand to create touch sensations without mechanical movement.\" Anyone who used RIM's BlackBerry Storm will have experienced the muddle of mechanical haptic feedback. Push on a button and you'd experience a click. It was deeply unsatisfactory and even a little off-putting. \"What we have been able to do is to take this phenomenon into something that not just scientifically interesting, but has clear user benefits,\" says Makinen. \"We make touchscreens come alive.\" Subconscious reaction In the past, he notes, haptic feedback has meant physical movement - \"which is good for a phone ringing or event notification.\" (That's your phone vibrating when someone calls; the vibration is caused by the rotation of an asymmetric weight inside the device.) \"In nature, vibration is an alarm. So that's good for alerts. But that isn't how we experience touch.\" Subconsciously, if something actively vibrates when we touch it, that's bad; the subliminal message is that something bad has happened. \"Rather than that, we're looking at how your hand explores the world - so that you can experience ridges on a table, for example. But going from a functional prototype to production is a long road.\" So when would production be achieved? Speaking in January, Makinen said that \"we expect that we will be in a consumer product by this Christmas.\" What sort of product? \"A tablet-sized device,\" he hedged. However, he was more forthcoming last June in an interview with Trusted Reviews, when he said that Senseg was talking to a \"tablet maker in Cupertino\". There's only one of those. Senseg has also been talking to mobile phone manufacturers, but \"that requires more investigation\". The need is less obvious - and less pressing. \"We have a lab version for mobile phones, but it takes more time to make it work.\" The killer app? \"Is that it's like a normal touchscreen - there isn't any extra layer. And you can use it for many purposes. You can believe that you can feel an object on the screen. So you can feel if you're doing the right action - say, moving your finger through a channel, because you would \"bump\" into the sides. \"Once you start using a system with these haptics, then you become so used to it that you feel lost if you're using a system without it.\" Press any key That's a key point - and, if Senseg's technology is incorporated into future products from any company (but especially an ambitious one looking to corner a fast-growing market) then that could turn into a key distinction. One key criticism of tablets at present is that it's hard to type accurately with the onscreen keyboards; if the keys, or the key edges had a tangible presence, that would make an enormous difference to accuracy. if you're reading this on a desktop or laptop, try closing your eyes and running your fingers over the keys: feel the edges? Now imagine a version of that on a smooth screen.) \"We're bringing tactile interaction to the screen,\" says Makinen. \"We don't know how far it will go; but what we're saying is that it's a totally new technology that you can mass manufacture. There are no mechanical moving parts.\" That's all well and good - but how would developers take advantage of it? \"There are Senseg libraries and an API,\" says Makinen. He suggests that they're available for Android, iOS, Linux and Windows through a chip that Senseg has produced. \"We get a couple of requests per day for an API for people to start coding against.\" And what about the physical components that have to be added to the screen? \"That adds perhaps a micrometre to the thickness and needs maybe a couple of steps to the manufacture. From our perspective the problem has been that these were gesture devices that you made. So you needed a lot ouf there. We have a lot of pull because a lot of people think that it's pretty cool. But look what might have happened if we'd chosen to go with one manufacturer. If we had just gone with HP and they'd used it on the TouchPad, then we'd have been screwed.\" (HP abandoned manufacture of the TouchPad within weeks of putting it on sale, and has all but abandoned the product.) \"Which is why it's important to find a successful use.\" Will Windows 8 tablets be a potential application? \"That's the most likely. The user interface is very much touch-based. Today we are generic code, Android is applicable. We can have native applications. We have two paths - more complicated to define solid API support for haptics. There's thousands of APIs in Android for haptics. We aren't exactly sure what the boundary is in terms of how deep or shallow the integration should be into the OS.\" That's because developers, device makers and OS creators have to allow for the fact that a program might be running on a haptic-enabled tablet - or might not. Should programs always insist on it? How should the OS or device notify an app that it has haptics enabled? And what if they're different? Costs: manufacturing and battery life Now on to the hard questions: how much does it cost, and how much battery life do you sacrifice for it? \"Manufacturing cost depends on volumes,\" hedges Makinen. \"Touchscreens and displays are already pretty expensive. It would probably add less than 10% to the cost.\" But doesn't generating an electric field eat up the battery? \"It uses less than 5% of typical battery capacity,\" Makinen says. So rather than 10 hours' life (not a figure he offered), you'd get 9.5, though more if you didn't spend much time swiping the screen, the battery hit might be less. What about rivals? \"There are other haptic systems about\" - he mentions \"Tesla Touch\", which was working on the same topic inside, of all places, Disney - \"but they require a total restructure of the screen rather than an intermediate manufacturing step. This is cheaper than technologies such as piezoelectric systems, which actually bend the screen.\" Will Senseg's technology be part of the next iPads? Even if it isn't, it's a promising and intriguing system which deserves wider use - to improve typing on tablets, if nothing else. Charles Arthur's trip to Finland was paid for by Finnfacts, an independent media service organisation that provides contacts between international media and Finnish business.",

(\"And we have several more in the pipeline,\" adds Petri Jehkonen, the technical marketing manager.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387023824\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331123812029/senseg-460.png\" alt=\"Senseg patent application\" width=\"460\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diagram from Senseg's US patent application for the E-Sense technology</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Senseg was founded in 2008, but the idea for the technology grew out of medical technology studies that Makinen did for his PhD in cognitive science, examining how we perceive stimuli, and the body's reaction and interaction with electric fields.</p> <h2>Forceful moves</h2> <p>The technology uses the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/140084/Coulomb-force\">Coulomb force</a> - the one which means you can rub a balloon against your hair and get it to stick. If you have two (fairly) nonconductive objects and you create a charge difference between them, there will be a measurable electrostatic force pulling them together. (When you rub the balloon on your head, electrons transfer from your hair, leaving your hair slightly positively charged, and the balloon negatively charged. Opposite charges then attract.)</p> <p>In the case of Senseg and the tablets, the effect is generated by high-voltage electric fields effectively running in a grid across its surface. (The grid is actually embedded underneath the surface during the manufacturing process.) </p> <p>\"The Coulomb force pulls the finger towards the surface,\" says Makinen. \"Humans are basically large conductive objects. We use a high voltage - about one kilovolt - but zero current.\" That means it's completely safe: despite what signs by electricity pylons say, it's current, not high voltage per se, that kills.</p> <p>However, static forces are very weak, and so very difficult for humans to feel. So making the fields tangible requires an extra step. \"We modelled systems to create frequencies that the hand is particularly sensitive to,\" he says. Turning the electric field on and off at between 10Hz and 1KHz (Senseg keeps the figure a trade secret), alerts the sense of touch: \"it's effectively a modulation of the friction of the screen.\" At its strongest, \"we can make a finger stick and almost stop.\" But, he adds, \"that might not be a pleasant feeling.\"</p> <p>Development has taken some time, but venture capital investors include the founders of Skype and the Finnish government. \"We had the technology before there were tablets,\" explains Makinen. \"And then a clearer use in touch screens emerged. There's a huge need but we weren't ready. But there was a demand to create touch sensations without mechanical movement.\"</p> <p>Anyone who used <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/nov/27/blackberry-storm\">RIM's BlackBerry Storm</a> will have experienced the muddle of mechanical haptic feedback. Push on a button and you'd experience a click. It was deeply unsatisfactory and even a little off-putting.</p> <p>\"What we have been able to do is to take this phenomenon into something that not just scientifically interesting, but has clear user benefits,\" says Makinen. \"We make touchscreens come alive.\"</p> <h2>Subconscious reaction</h2> <p>In the past, he notes, haptic feedback has meant physical movement - \"which is good for a phone ringing or event notification.\" (That's your phone vibrating when someone calls; the vibration is caused by the rotation of an asymmetric weight inside the device.) \"In nature, vibration is an alarm. So that's good for alerts. But that isn't how we experience touch.\" Subconsciously, if something actively vibrates when we touch it, that's bad; the subliminal message is that something bad has happened.</p> <p>\"Rather than that, we're looking at how your hand explores the world - so that you can experience ridges on a table, for example. But going from a functional prototype to production is a long road.\"</p> <p>So when would production be achieved? Speaking in January, Makinen said that \"we expect that we will be in a consumer product by this Christmas.\" What sort of product? \"A tablet-sized device,\" he hedged. However, he was more forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/how-finland-brought-down-nokia-revived-itself_Page-2\">last June in an interview with Trusted Reviews</a>, when he said that Senseg was talking to a \"tablet maker in Cupertino\". There's only one of those.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387023822\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/3/2/1330709847368/appleinvite_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Apple's teaser invitation, product launch 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple's teaser invitation to a 7 March event in San Francisco, apparently showing a detail of the much-bruited iPad. So is Senseg supplying the \"touch\"?</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Senseg has also been talking to mobile phone manufacturers, but \"that requires more investigation\". The need is less obvious - and less pressing. \"We have a lab version for mobile phones, but it takes more time to make it work.\"</p> <p>The killer app? \"Is that it's like a normal touchscreen - there isn't any extra layer. And you can use it for many purposes. You can believe that you can feel an object on the screen. So you can feel if you're doing the right action - say, moving your finger through a channel, because you would \"bump\" into the sides. \"Once you start using a system with these haptics, then you become so used to it that you feel lost if you're using a system without it.\"</p> <h2>Press any key</h2> <p>That's a key point - and, if Senseg's technology is incorporated into future products from any company (but especially an ambitious one looking to corner a fast-growing market) then that could turn into a key distinction. One key criticism of tablets at present is that it's hard to type accurately with the onscreen keyboards; if the keys, or the key edges had a tangible presence, that would make an enormous difference to accuracy. if you're reading this on a desktop or laptop, try closing your eyes and running your fingers over the keys: feel the edges? Now imagine a version of that on a smooth screen.)</p> <p>\"We're bringing tactile interaction to the screen,\" says Makinen. \"We don't know how far it will go; but what we're saying is that it's a totally new technology that you can mass manufacture. There are no mechanical moving parts.\"</p> <p>That's all well and good - but how would developers take advantage of it? \"There are Senseg libraries and an API,\" says Makinen. He suggests that they're available for Android, iOS, Linux and Windows through a chip that Senseg has produced. \"We get a couple of requests per day for an API for people to start coding against.\"</p> <p>And what about the physical components that have to be added to the screen? \"That adds perhaps a micrometre to the thickness and needs maybe a couple of steps to the manufacture. From our perspective the problem has been that these were gesture devices that you made. So you needed a lot ouf there. We have a lot of pull because a lot of people think that it's pretty cool. But look what might have happened if we'd chosen to go with one manufacturer. If we had just gone with HP and they'd used it on the TouchPad, then we'd have been screwed.\" (HP abandoned manufacture of the TouchPad within weeks of putting it on sale, and has all but abandoned the product.) \"Which is why it's important to find a successful use.\"</p> <p>Will Windows 8 tablets be a potential application? \"That's the most likely. The user interface is very much touch-based. Today we are generic code, Android is applicable. We can have native applications. We have two paths - more complicated to define solid API support for haptics. There's thousands of APIs in Android for haptics. We aren't exactly sure what the boundary is in terms of how deep or shallow the integration should be into the OS.\" That's because developers, device makers and OS creators have to allow for the fact that a program might be running on a haptic-enabled tablet - or might not. Should programs always insist on it? How should the OS or device notify an app that it has haptics enabled? And what if they're different? </p> <h2>Costs: manufacturing and battery life</h2> <p>Now on to the hard questions: how much does it cost, and how much battery life do you sacrifice for it? \"Manufacturing cost depends on volumes,\" hedges Makinen. \"Touchscreens and displays are already pretty expensive. It would probably add less than 10% to the cost.\" </p> <p>But doesn't generating an electric field eat up the battery? \"It uses less than 5% of typical battery capacity,\" Makinen says. So rather than 10 hours' life (not a figure he offered), you'd get 9.5, though more if you didn't spend much time swiping the screen, the battery hit might be less.</p> <p>What about rivals? \"There are other haptic systems about\" - he mentions <a href=\"http://www.disneyresearch.com/research/projects/hci_teslatouch_drp.htm\">\"Tesla Touch\"</a>, which was working on the same topic inside, of all places, Disney - \"but they require a total restructure of the screen rather than an intermediate manufacturing step. This is cheaper than technologies such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity\">piezoelectric</a> systems, which actually bend the screen.\" </p> <p>Will Senseg's technology be part of the next iPads? Even if it isn't, it's a promising and intriguing system which deserves wider use - to improve typing on tablets, if nothing else.</p> <p><em>Charles Arthur's trip to Finland was paid for by <a href=\"http://www.finnfacts.fi/About-us\">Finnfacts</a>, an independent media service organisation that provides contacts between international media and Finnish business.</em></p>",

The former Scotland Yard boss, Lord Blair, said the scheme under which old police horses were housed and bills for their care were paid by members of the public was preferable to having to put the animal down. News that Brooks was lent a police horse in 2008 when she was editor of the Sun came as the Met tries to deflect claims that it became too close to News International. Blair also told the inquiry his son had undertaken work at the Sun, as had the son of another former commissioner, Lord Condon. Blair said he and Brooks had had lunch in 2007 but he could not recall approving the horse's loan: \"I have no recollection of being asked to give my authority.\" Blair then referred to evidence the inquiry will hear from Scotland Yard's press chief, Dick Fedorcio, about the loan of the horse. Blair said: \"What I understand Mr Fedorcio will say is that he was telephoned by Rebekah Brooks asking about this arrangement that she had heard that this arrangement existed, and that then he arranged for her to go down and see the inspector in charge of horses and then have a discussion about it and this actually seems to have happened on the day that I had lunch with her, and what I understand Mr Fedorcio is going to say is that this was discussed at the lunch. I have absolutely no recollection of that.\" Blair was commissioner from 2005 to 2008. He was in effect sacked by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who declared he had lost confidence in him. Blair said that some senior police officers learned to gossip to the press after copying the behaviour of politicians. Blair said: \"I believe that where the problem may have become significant is that a very small number of relatively senior officers increasingly became too close to journalists, not I believe for financial gain but for the enhancement of their reputation and for the sheer enjoyment of being in a position to share and divulge confidences. \"It is a siren song. I also believe that they based their behaviour on how they saw politicians behave and that they lost sight of their professional obligations. \"The MPS [Metropolitican Police Service] did not have adequate defences against this behaviour and in previous decades would not have needed it.\" Blair said when he became commissioner his senior team were too obsessed with the press: \"I merely felt there was too much discussion about the press rather than about the facts, as it were.\" Counsel to the inquiry Robert Jay QC asked if he had ever suspected his own press chief had briefed against him, as an earlier witness, the former Met officer Brian Paddick, had claimed. Jay asked: \"Do you mind if I ask you this blunt question: did you ever suspect that Mr Fedorcio was the source of leaks?\" Blair said the inquiry needed to ask Fedorcio that. Blair said politicians had the right to set policing priorities but not to interfere in operations: \"Relationships between police and politicians and police and the press must be seen as only two sides of a three-sided triangle, with the third relationship, that between the press and politicians, having an enormous impact on the other two relationships.\"",

      "bodyText": "In the race to meet the millennium development goals, cash transfer (CT) programmes have made a significant impact on reducing the numbers of those in poverty. Yet, a combination of disabling conditions still leaves millions of women trapped in destitution, and at great risk of disease and domestic and civil violence. CTs are programmes that give mothers a cash supplement to cover the costs of children's schooling. In Latin America (but not in Africa), they are conditional on children's attendance at school and health clinics for check-ups. Success has been measured in higher rates of enrolment, and improved nutritional levels of children, and breastfeeding and pregnant women. Women are said to be \"empowered\" by being given charge of the cash stipend. Though they are a welcome palliative, critical voices have been raised about the limits of these programmes (pdf). The stipend, at around half the minimum wage, is too low to make a great difference, and in the majority of cases there are no training and employment links that could secure sustainable livelihoods. When investment in health and education is limited or misdirected, the quality of services suffers, and benefits are less positive than the statistics show. Cash transfers are designed to prevent the inter-generational transmission of poverty by focusing on children's needs. While an entirely laudable and necessary objective, the means of securing it raise questions about the effectiveness and ethics of \"micro-targeted\" cash\u2013only programmes where general conditions are poor and all household members suffer acute deprivation and vulnerability. It is a well-established fact that children flourish when their mothers are educated and healthy, and suffer when they are not; households flourish when they are free of violence, and are more sustainable when women are able to generate an income. These conditions cannot be secured by small amounts of cash alone, however valuable these may be in contexts of extreme hardship. From a gender perspective, other questions are raised about the design of these programmes. While mothers are the linchpin for the success of these policies, their own needs are rarely attended to, except insofar as they are the bearers of children. Even then, the evidence suggests that the services offered to mothers in these programmes are poor. Reproductive health is narrowly defined, and supplies and delivery are often inadequate. The lack of adequate resources for reproductive health in many cases contributes to high levels of maternal morbidity and mortality, and the growing problem of adolescent pregnancies. No wonder then, that maternal mortality rates are one of the MDG failures \u2013 and are still unacceptably high in many countries. And no wonder so many women die early from preventable disease. This is the less happy story behind the positive trends in poverty reduction. From an equality perspective, these maternal models of care raise other questions, particularly where \"paternal irresponsibility\" is a recognised problem. In reinforcing women's motherhood role, do these programmes take adequate account of their income-generating activities? What is likely to be the long term impact of reinforcing women's motherhood responsibilities? Is it desirable that men are marginalised from caretaking roles? Could more co-operative forms of care be encouraged? There is a growing body of research that has begun to cast light on these issues. It shows that while women appreciate gaining control over even a small element of household income, their \"empowerment\" is seen as limited and double-edged. Women want the means to escape poverty, not just the means to manage it. For all their celebrated successes, these programmes seem to be in need of some rethinking if poverty among the most vulnerable in society \u2013 which includes a disproportionate number of women \u2013 is indeed to be tackled. That involves adopting a more integrated approach to poverty reduction, and a commitment to complementing income support with employment and training. It also involves taking women's needs and forms of vulnerability seriously. CT programmes are inexpensive, at around 0.5% of GDP, and the cost of improving their design in these ways is marginal. It wouldn't take much extra investment to get far better results. A few programmes already do this, and some new ones will incorporate additional elements to maximise their impact on poverty and provide beneficiaries with more opportunities to escape poverty, reduce the harms it inflicts, and to live dignified lives.

Yet, a combination of disabling conditions still leaves millions of women trapped in destitution, and at great risk of disease and domestic and civil violence.</p> <p>CTs are programmes that give mothers a cash supplement to cover the costs of children's schooling. In Latin America (but not in Africa), they are conditional on children's attendance at school and health clinics for check-ups. Success has been measured in higher rates of enrolment, and improved nutritional levels of children, and breastfeeding and pregnant women.

      "bodyText": "Free Speech, a new live debate show for BBC3, begins tonight with the aim of creating an innovative platform for young people to voice their concerns on issues that are increasingly affecting them. Like many others my age, I'm hoping the show won't be another opportunity for the media to depict young people as lazy, work shy or feckless \u2013 and I must admit, I'm feeling very optimistic. There's a real problem with debate shows in both radio and television. Aside from under-representing women and ethnic minorities, 16- to 24-year-olds are often spoken for by an older generation. From Newsnight to 10 O' Clock Live, my generation \u2013 I'm a 20-year-old student at Goldsmiths College in south London \u2013 are rarely asked to comment on the issues that also affect them. During the \"workfare\"/ Tesco story where was the 16- to 24-year-old panellist on Question Time, for instance? It's not something that's confined to the broadcast media. Newspapers tend to either rely on out-of-touch writers to discuss the trials of youth, or wheel out the same young person over and over as a sort of unelected spokesperson to vouch for us as a collective. Following from Young Voters' Question Time, also on BBC3, the monthly Free Speech might go some way to balancing that. Hosted by Jake Humphrey, audiences will be able to let the panel know exactly what they think via an interactive formula on Twitter; approving or disapproving panellists' comments throughout the debate. A 90s computer game-style power bar displaying the level of agreement will be lodged on the bottom of the screen. Apart from being a great way for young people to engage in politics, I think its important to have a show that's tailor-made for younger viewers. While I might spend my Thursday evenings watching David Dimbleby seamlessly chair a Question Time debate I know this isn't the case for many of my friends. Free Speech's extensive use of social media could be key in engaging viewers with the debate \u2013 particularly if it's of the same quality as this YouTube video featuring Dead Poets' Mark Grist and MC Mixy. There are a few avenues through which young people attempt to get their voices heard; organisations such as Livity (with which I'm involved), Channel 4's Battlefront and online broadcaster SBTV are good examples. But none are capable of reaching the same number of viewers as Free Speech. As I'm going to be part of the audience later tonight \u2013 you can apply via BBC3 for future shows \u2013 I quite like that the show won't be focusing on one single issue. Young people are able to speak at length about more than just the England riots. Topics are chosen by the public through the Free Speech Facebook group, with the \"Hot Five\" issues making the cut for the live show every month. Among the topics tonight will be benefit cuts, body image and cyber bullying. The panel will include actor Adam Deacon, Conservative MP Esther McVey, Radio 1's Gemma Cairney and entrepreneur Dominic McVey. \u2022 Free Speech is on BBC3, March 7 at 10pm",

During the \"workfare\"/ Tesco story where was the 16- to 24-year-old panellist on Question Time, for instance?</p> <p>It's not something that's confined to the broadcast media. Newspapers tend to either rely on out-of-touch writers to discuss the trials of youth, or wheel out the same young person over and over as a sort of unelected spokesperson to vouch for us as a collective.</p> <p>Following from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/mar/04/first-time-voters-question-time\" title=\"\">Young Voters' Question Time</a>, also on BBC3, the monthly Free Speech might go some way to balancing that. Hosted by Jake Humphrey, audiences will be able to let the panel know exactly what they think via an interactive formula on Twitter; approving or disapproving panellists' comments throughout the debate. A 90s computer game-style power bar displaying the level of agreement will be lodged on the bottom of the screen.</p> <p>Apart from being a great way for young people to engage in politics, I think its important to have a show that's tailor-made for younger viewers. While I might spend my Thursday evenings watching David Dimbleby seamlessly chair a Question Time debate I know this isn't the case for many of my friends. Free Speech's extensive use of social media could be key in engaging viewers with the debate \u2013 particularly if it's of the same quality as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTqWSypMJfY\" title=\"\">this YouTube video featuring Dead Poets' Mark Grist and MC Mixy</a>.</p> <p>There are a few avenues through which young people attempt to get their voices heard; organisations such as <a href=\"http://livity.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Livity</a> (with which I'm involved), <a href=\"http://www.battlefront.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Channel 4's Battlefront</a> and <a href=\"http://sbtv.co.uk/\" title=\"\">online broadcaster SBTV</a> are good examples. But none are capable of reaching the same number of viewers as Free Speech.</p> <p>As I'm going to be part of the audience later tonight \u2013 you <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcthree/\" title=\"\">can apply via BBC3 for future shows</a> \u2013 I quite like that the show won't be focusing on one single issue. Young people are able to speak at length about more than just the England riots. Topics are chosen by the public through <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/BBCFreeSpeech\">the Free Speech Facebook group</a>, with the \"Hot Five\" issues making the cut for the live show every month.</p> <p>Among the topics tonight will be benefit cuts, body image and cyber bullying. The panel will include actor Adam Deacon, Conservative MP Esther McVey, Radio 1's Gemma Cairney and entrepreneur Dominic McVey.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Free Speech is on BBC3, March 7 at 10pm</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "So far, it has been a dreadful week for journalists and activists in Iran. According to the opposition website, Kaleme.com, a Tehran appeals court has confirmed the jailing of prominent Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, albeit reducing it from 11 years to six. The 39-year-old, the deputy head of Iran's Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC), was taken seriously ill in 2010 after being kept in solitary confinement in Tehran's Evin prison for a month. Since her arrest, she has developed an undiagnosed epilepsy-like disease which causes her to lose control over her muscles temporarily during the day. In September 2011, she was sentenced to 11 years after being convicted on three charges: acting against the national security, membership of the DHRC and propaganda against the regime. Read Amnesty's report on her jail sentence here. Mohammadi, a mother of two and winner of the 2009 Alexander Langer award for her human rights activities, especially for her efforts for an end to death penalty for juvenile offenders in Iran, must now endure a six year jail term. On Sunday, another human rights activist and lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, was sentenced to 18 years after being found guilty of anti-government propaganda. Among many of Soltani's charges is \"endangering national security\" by accepting a German human rights prize. Kaleme also reported that Iranian journalist Nazanin Khosravani who has been sentenced to 6 six years went to Evin prison on Monday to endure her jail term. According to the opposition website, the Green Voice of Freedom, Khosravani has worked with banned pro-reform newspapers such as Bahar, Norooz, Dorane Emrouz, Kargozaran and Sarmayeh. Another Iranian journalist, Ali Mousavi Khalkhali, was picked up by security officials on Friday, his cousin has confirmed to BBC Persian. He is reported to have been arrested on charges related to propaganda against the regime. According to Reporters Without Borders, Mousavi Khalkhali has worked for the Irdiplomacy news website and is \"a nephew of Ayatollah Hakim, a senior Shiite cleric of Iranian origin in Iraq\".

      "bodyText": "As many as 12 of Britain's 19 civil nuclear sites are at risk of flooding and coastal erosion because of climate change, according to an unpublished government analysis obtained by the Guardian. Nine of the sites have been assessed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as being vulnerable now, while others are in danger from rising sea levels and storms in the future. The sites include all of the eight proposed for new nuclear power stations around the coast, as well as numerous radioactive waste stores, operating reactors and defunct nuclear facilities. Two of the sites for the new stations \u2013 Sizewell in Suffolk and Hartlepool in County Durham, where there are also operating reactors \u2013 are said to have a current high risk of flooding. Closed and running reactors at Dungeness, Kent, are also classed as currently at high risk. Another of the sites at risk is Hinkley Point in Somerset, where the first of the new nuclear stations is planned and where there are reactors in operation and being decommissioned. According to Defra, Hinkley Point already has a low risk of flooding, and by the 2080s will face a high risk of both flooding and erosion. Other new reactor sites that face some risk now and high risk by the 2080s are Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Bradwell, Essex. The huge old nuclear complex at Sellafield, Cumbria, is said to face a medium risk of flooding now and later. The analysis was conducted by officials from Defra's floods and coastal erosion team as part of a major investigation into the impact of climate change on the UK. But when the results were published in January only summary numbers for the 2080s were mentioned and no individual sites were named. Defra has now, however, released its full analysis in response to a request under freedom of information legislation. As a result, the department's assessments of the risks for individual sites can be disclosed for the first time. Many of the sites date back to the 1950s and 1960s, and are unlikely to be fully decommissioned for many decades. Seven of those containing radioactive waste stores are judged to be at some risk of flooding now, with a further three at risk of erosion by the 2080s. Experts suggested the main concern was of inundation causing nuclear waste leaks. \"Sea level rise, especially in the south-east of England, will mean some of these sites will be under water within 100 years,\" said David Crichton, a flood specialist and honorary professor at the hazard research centre at University College London. \"This will make decommissioning expensive and difficult, not to mention the recovery and movement of nuclear waste to higher ground.\" The French nuclear company EDF Energy was confident that all its nuclear sites in Britain were adequately protected against storms and floods. \"Without these arrangements in place the regulator would have the authority to close us down,\" said an EDF spokeswoman. Reports by the government's Office for Nuclear Regulation since the Fukushima nuclear accident a year ago had confirmed the \"fundamental safety\" of Britain's nuclear plants, the spokeswoman said. \"Protection from flooding has also been factored into our new-build plans and will be covered by a robust regulatory regime, should consent be granted.\" The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the government body responsible for dismantling old nuclear plants, said flood risk at every site was reviewed at least every 10 years. New climate change hazards were likely to emerge slowly giving \"time to develop and implement credible solutions\", said an NDA spokesman. He continued: \"Existing power stations are designed with flood protection measures to protect against a one-in-10,000-year flood event and planning requirements state that new nuclear plants are also designed to take account of climate change impacts.\" But Greenpeace accused the government and nuclear industry of covering up the real extent of flood and erosion risk. \"It makes you wonder what other important information about the safety of our nuclear plants the government and EDF might be hiding,\" said the group's chief scientist, Doug Parr. A Defra spokesperson said: \"As the nuclear regulator has said the UK's nuclear sites are fundamentally safe with protection against current and future flood risk built in. The Climate Change Risk Assessment analyses possible outcomes by 2080 if no actions were taken to protect against the effects of climate change. This is clearly not the case - nuclear operators are already well aware of the risk of flooding, now and in the future, and are taking the action necessary to protect sites.\"\u202c\u202a",

Closed and running reactors at Dungeness, Kent, are also classed as currently at high risk.</p> <p>Another of the sites at risk is Hinkley Point in Somerset, where the first of the new nuclear stations is planned and where there are reactors in operation and being decommissioned.</p> <p>According to Defra, Hinkley Point already has a low risk of flooding, and by the 2080s will face a high risk of both flooding and erosion.</p> <p>Other new reactor sites that face some risk now and high risk by the 2080s are Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Bradwell, Essex.</p> <p>The huge old nuclear complex at Sellafield, Cumbria, is said to face a medium risk of flooding now and later.</p> <p>The analysis was conducted by officials from Defra's floods and coastal erosion team as part of <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climate/government/risk-assessment/\" title=\"\">a major investigation into the impact of climate change on the UK</a>. But when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/26/floods-worst-climate-change-uk\" title=\"\">results were published in January</a> only summary numbers for the 2080s were mentioned and no individual sites were named.</p> <p>Defra has now, however, released its full analysis in response to a request under freedom of information legislation. As a result, the department's assessments of the risks for individual sites can be disclosed for the first time.</p> <p>Many of the sites date back to the 1950s and 1960s, and are unlikely to be fully decommissioned for many decades. Seven of those containing radioactive waste stores are judged to be at some risk of flooding now, with a further three at risk of erosion by the 2080s.</p> <p>Experts suggested the main concern was of inundation causing nuclear waste leaks.</p> <p>\"Sea level rise, especially in the south-east of England, will mean some of these sites will be under water within 100 years,\" said <a href=\"http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/professor-david-crichton-ma-fcii/13/504/5b\" title=\"\">David Crichton</a>, a flood specialist and honorary professor at the hazard research centre at University College London. \"This will make decommissioning expensive and difficult, not to mention the recovery and movement of nuclear waste to higher ground.\"</p> <p>The French nuclear company EDF Energy was confident that all its nuclear sites in Britain were adequately protected against storms and floods. \"Without these arrangements in place the regulator would have the authority to close us down,\" said an EDF spokeswoman.</p> <p>Reports by the government's Office for Nuclear Regulation since the Fukushima nuclear accident a year ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/11/nuclear-industry-review-uk\" title=\"\">had confirmed</a> the \"fundamental safety\" of Britain's nuclear plants, the spokeswoman said. \"Protection from flooding has also been factored into our new-build plans and will be covered by a robust regulatory regime, should consent be granted.\"</p> <p>The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the government body responsible for dismantling old nuclear plants, said flood risk at every site was reviewed at least every 10 years.</p> <p>New climate change hazards were likely to emerge slowly giving \"time to develop and implement credible solutions\", said an NDA spokesman.</p> <p>He continued: \"Existing power stations are designed with flood protection measures to protect against a one-in-10,000-year flood event and planning requirements state that new nuclear plants are also designed to take account of climate change impacts.\"</p> <p>But Greenpeace accused the government and nuclear industry of covering up the real extent of flood and erosion risk. \"It makes you wonder what other important information about the safety of our nuclear plants the government and EDF might be hiding,\" said the group's chief scientist, Doug Parr.</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said: \"As the nuclear regulator has said the UK's nuclear sites are fundamentally safe with protection against current and future flood risk built in. The Climate Change Risk Assessment analyses possible outcomes by 2080 if no actions were taken to protect against the effects of climate change. This is clearly not the case - nuclear operators are already well aware of the risk of flooding, now and in the future, and are taking the action necessary to protect sites.\"\u202c\u202a</p>",

      "bodyText": "Winning isn't the main thing, goes the saying attributed to the American football coach Vince Lombardi: it's the only thing. Winning in Ohio and five other Super Tuesday state primaries keeps Mitt Romney at the front of the race for the Republican presidential nomination \u2013 and, make no mistake about it, that will be good enough for him. But it was a far from emphatic performance. The price of Romney's victories is proving to be increasingly high for him and his party. That's because Romney did well, winning six states against three for Rick Santorum and one for Newt Gingrich. But it was not well enough. Romney's rivals ran him far too close for comfort. They are all, Ron Paul included, still in the race. And the primary calendar for the rest of March, skewed towards the conservative south, gives them all reasons to hang on in there. While that happens, the doubts will only mount about whether the lacklustre Romney has what it takes to win when it matters. Two of the results underscore this in particular. Ohio was by far the most important contest. It's a big industrial state, and a political bellwether: Republicans who win presidential elections have to win Ohio. But Romney won only by a whisker \u2013 38% to 37%. It's an important whisker, but a whisker nonetheless. It also didn't help Romney that he only ground out the victory over Santorum at about midnight local time, towards the end of counting. For much of the night, when most television viewers may have been looking, Santorum led the count. None of this helps Romney consolidate his position. The other state that said something particularly worth noticing was Virginia. Virginia, like Ohio, is a swing state. Republicans used to dominate in Virginia but have increasingly lost out to the Democrats in important elections. They will need to beat Barack Obama here in November to win back the White House. Tuesday's Virginia primary contained only two candidates: Romney and the anti-tax, anti-government isolationist Ron Paul. Yet Romney could muster only 60% of the vote in a straight fight with the least credible of all the Republican challengers. That's hardly a ringing vote of confidence. The other results tell a series of local stories with little impact on the moving story. Romney's big win in Massachusetts, where he served a term as governor, was predictable and tells most Republicans (for whom Massachusetts spells liberalism) nothing they want to know. The big win in Idaho, by contrast, was a good result for Romney in a mostly Republican state. But his wins in Vermont, where he took 40% of the votes, and Alaska, where he came first with only 33%, were reminders that Romney is fairly good at winning but bad at winning big. In these states, just as in Ohio, most Republicans rejected Romney. Super Tuesday should not be over-hyped. It is a conceit invented by the media to give a bit of late-winter spice to the long and winding road that leads from Iowa and New Hampshire to the final primaries, in distant June. It's the name given to a cluster of primaries in early March, which together carry more heft than the sum of their parts. But the truth is that this year's Tuesday cluster isn't very super at all. With the exception of Ohio and Virginia, most of the states that held primaries are footsoldiers in the presidential election race, not field marshals. With all possible respect to states such as Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota and Vermont, these are electoral minnows. That's why, with the exception of Tennessee, Santorum's wins don't suggest that he has the electoral clout to make the difference where it matters in November. Winning in North Dakota and Oklahoma is better than not winning them, but Santorum has fought hard in a number of big states now, and has lost almost all of them: Florida, Michigan and Ohio. For a candidate who stresses his appeal to the blue-collar voters who were once dubbed the Reagan Democrats, this is an important message. The same verdict applies to Gingrich and Paul. Both have the power to wound Romney; neither of them, though, has the power to defeat him. Gingrich's win in his home state of Georgia proves nothing more widely. And Paul's second places in Virginia and North Dakota leave him the darling of the conservative Twittersphere but an irrelevance to the final outcome. Super Tuesday, in short, has solved nothing. Romney is a bit closer to the nomination than he was before, but the larger questions are as loud as ever. Can the conservative Republican base bring itself to rally behind Romney if he finally takes the nomination? Will the independent voters, to whom Romney claimed to appeal but who have been notably resistant to him so far, change their minds? Do the divisions between a field of variously unsatisfactory candidates mean that party bosses \u2013 if they really exist \u2013 will try to parachute a supposedly unifying and ideal candidate, such as Jeb Bush, into the contest? Will Romney's halting march to the nomination increase the likelihood of a third party candidate? Only one question looks to have a clearer answer now: is this process helping Barack Obama? The answer to that is, yes. It is an answer that can only feed the sense of a living nightmare within the Republican party.",

      "bodyText": "In a way, Vince Cable's \"leaked\" letter about the feebleness of his own coalition government's approach to tax and industrial regeneration is the business secretary's revenge on the Daily Telegraph, whose honeypot sting in his constituency surgery last year represented a new low in broadsheet journalism. It challenges the paper's core beliefs, as do wider Lib Dem tax pressures ahead of the budget on 21 March. This week's idea \u2013 promoted by Rachel Sylvester in the Times \u2013 that the Tories are split between urban, rational Economist readers (George Osborne types) and romantic, traditional Country Life readers finds the modern Torygraph firmly in the former camp, though it pretends otherwise to the readers. Sure enough, today's Telegraph picks up the challenge, blaming Cable's own portfolio for admitted failures to achieve growth (George Osborne's bald spot is growing faster than the economy, the Times sketchwriter reports) and arguing that the coalition's Jeremiah should be retired. Having done its best to get him sacked for bad-mouthing Tory partners to a couple of wired Telegraph reporters in 2011, it's no surprise the paper is still on his case, ungrateful that his parallel rubbishing of Rupert Murdoch (the bit it covered up) has since been vindicated. Murdoch is mortally wounded. But enough of this playground squabbling. I do not know how Cable's letter (sent to David Cameron and Nick Clegg) came into the public domain, but it sounds more of a Lib Dem positioning \"leak\" that fell off the back of a party bus than a hostile leak by the Tories or Whitehall. Bits of it surfaced in the FT last month. Cable is 69 in May, and at that age most people are a bit demob happy, glad to be alive and busy. So they don't have much to lose. What Cable protests is several-fold. Like Steve Hilton, the departing Cameron strategist, he complains about a \"lack of vision\", easier said than achieved during a grim and protracted economic contraction that hovers like a storm cloud. Specifically he wants the Royal Bank of Scotland, struggling to defuse what its boss, Stephen Hester, calls the time bomb of bad debts, to be broken up, in part to create an industrial bank that lends to small business, inventors and entrepreneurs. We've tried this before and then, as so often, changed tack. When Churchill was chancellor in the 20s he protested that finance was too proud and industry too low, but didn't manage to face down the austere grandees of the Bank of England who bullied him into restoring the deflationary gold standard. That's roughly where we still are: a floating currency but banks that have behaved badly and are busy recapitalising themselves at the expense of customers (and industry) amid deflationary fiscal austerity. I have been in Birmingham this week and it's not hard to find complaints about London banks and London venture capitalists, indeed London government. When Peter Mandelson had Vince's job, ministers clumsily failed to help Tata, the Indian steel company that had bought Jaguar and Land Rover, when it was going through a bad patch, a local MP explained. Luckily, Tata raised market funds and today JLR is booming. Excellent. The coalition made a similar mistake over Sheffield Forgemasters, and when Siemens beat (Canadian-owned) Bombardier of Derby for that major rail contract last year, one of Bombardier's complaints was that they were beaten on the financial side, not the engineering. German firms have access to long-term regional and industrial funds. Labour is belatedly looking at the model too. It isn't true that markets can resolve such issues without the carrot, stick and other services (better skills are needed in Brum) that only state agencies can provide. UK plc needs to be better at seeding small firms that may grow into big ones. So Cable is right about that and, I imagine, is trying to sway government to his thinking, not least via helpful \"leaks\", a routine tool in Whitehall turf wars. But what about taxation? On Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday he floated a trade-off: the Lib Dems were not \"ideologically wedded\" to the 50p tax rate on incomes above \u00a3100,000 \u2013 and would swap it for a wealth tax, preferably on residential property worth more than \u00a32m. That sounds fair enough. Rich people are good at hiding income, it's a game they play to show themselves how smart they are. Property in the real estate sense is harder to hide: it's just there. So a tax on property wealth, levied every year on bricks, mortar and reinforced concrete, is tempting. But the politics really suck and so do the practicalities. Vince first proposed a \"mansions tax\" in the heady days of opposition \u2013 I think the target figure was \u00a31m at the time, enough to frighten off a lot more people, not confined to those in houses currently worth that much \u2013 to a Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth, a few miles from Sandbanks, the wedge of Poole harbour that boasts one of the richest postcodes in Britain. But most \u00a32m houses are in London and the south-east. I was amazed to be reminded how much cheaper are the large and lovely homes in the Birmingham Post's property section than those in the London market, distorted as it is by hot money seeking a safe haven from overseas. I don't mind rich foreigners hiding their money here, though it puts pressure on better-off Londoners, their homes, schools, traffic and doctors, in the same way that poor immigrants and asylum seekers can't help doing to services in poorer neighbourhoods. But, just as we don't want immigrants or asylum seekers to engage in gangsterism, prostitution or benefit fraud (some do so as landlords too), we want the rich to pay their way too. I know, they say they do through tax and investments as well as the money they spend at Harrods. But they don't, not really, because people who devote their time and efforts to tax avoidance (that's legal, as distinct from tax evasion) on behalf of the rich are usually one step ahead of the tax man and like to win. This week's edition of BBC Panorama revealed an absolute stinker about how to manipulate EU farm subsidies in ways that allow the wealthy to plunder the tax system perfectly legally without necessarily growing anything at all. I thought I knew those practices but it's worse than I'd realised. By the same token the FT carried a letter this week from an old banker who calmly explained some complicated loss leader used in emerging market loans to extract funds from the Treasury, one that he regarded as fraud on the UK taxpayer. We're nowadays a smarter nation of lawyers and accountants, it seems, than we are manufacturers. So we shouldn't weep too much for these people. But there are practical consequences that have to be taken into account. The mansion tax would require property \u2013 not all of it sold lately, and therefore some lacking a market value \u2013 to be assessed. That's a costly nightmare, which is why council tax bands have not been reviewed since 1991 except (I think) in Wales where it also proved a political nightmare. No wonder Tory MPs \u2013 including a jittery Cameron, so we read \u2013 are nervous about the consequences for their voters, many of whom brought their creaking homes 40 years ago for very little and are now living on modest pensions: cash poor, as the saying goes. As you can discover, Joan Bakewell turns out to be sort of one of them. Look at the response to her article. I don't think the \u00a32m mansion tax will happen and I don't think the Osborne budget in two weeks' time will cut the 50p higher rate to 45p or back to 40p, not yet anyway. He's boxed in \u2013 and is smart enough to know it. As for the mansion tax, unkind Tories point out that it might catch Nick Clegg's Putney home, but none of Chris Huhne's eight. Looking elsewhere for revenue and fairness \u2013 \"we're all in this together\" \u2013 I'm sure that loopholes that allow Russian oligarchs to pay 0.5% stamp duty instead of the 5% that locals pay on property sales over the \u00a31m mark can be shrunk, if not entirely closed, at least in part. Boris Johnson has an amusing column on the subject in today's Telegraph. The mayor also finds time to take a swipe at Ken Livingstone's legal tax avoidance activities (he got paid through a company, like those civil servants), a fair target, more the cause for regret. If Red Ken think it's OK, we have a measure of the challenge. Treasury officials, never too keen to make their own lives harder, will be busy telling the chancellor that when one foreign company sells another foreign company that owns the said property to a third foreign company, the property itself hasn't changed hands. If these loopholes were easy to close someone would have done it. But it's always worth a try. What does that leave in the revenue-and-fairness stakes if money is to be found \u2013 as it should be \u2013 to ease the modest-but-painful income tax burdens on the poorest in work? Creating a new council house tax band or two, say one at \u00a3500,000 or \u00a31m \u2013 another at \u00a32m? \u2013 would be the right thing to do. The tax is currently disproportionately levied on band D average homes. But the cost and complexity, not to mention the Tory politics of it, render that option unlikely. By the same token the abolition of child benefit on households with someone earning more than \u00a343,000 \u2013 but not on those with two earners on \u00a340k \u2013 is pretty rough justice on middle-class families that need the money, as most do. Perhaps Osborne will trim the child benefit deal to make it less onerous and so obviously unfair. But my hunch is that he'll have to make his gesture to the \"soak the rich\" lobby \u2013 which is impossible to appease anyway \u2013 by a further squeeze on tax breaks on pension contributions. Ministers took a serious crack at them, capping annual deductible contributions at \u00a350,000 instead of \u00a3250,000, and may come back for more by making them basic rate only deductions. Unheroic, I know, but life often is. Under a headline \"When banks placate the mob\", a retired banker said he'd spent 35 years in the City asking for higher pay and a lower bonus, but was told that bonuses helped keep down bank overheads, like pension contributions and redundancy pay. Now that \"crowd hysteria\" has forced banks to cut bonuses and double some salaries we can expect them to become more uncompetitive and have to lay off even more people. I'm sure he has a point, but let's not draw it to the chancellor's attention. He's got problems enough.",

      "body": "<p>In a way, Vince Cable's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/mar/06/vince-cable-letter-economic-recovery\" title=\"\">\"leaked\" letter</a> about the feebleness of his own coalition government's approach to tax and industrial regeneration is the business secretary's revenge on the Daily Telegraph, whose honeypot sting in his constituency surgery last year represented a new low in broadsheet journalism.</p> <p>It challenges the paper's core beliefs, as do wider Lib Dem tax pressures ahead of the budget on 21 March. This week's idea \u2013 promoted by Rachel Sylvester in the Times \u2013 that the Tories are split between urban, rational Economist readers (George Osborne types) and romantic, traditional Country Life readers finds the modern Torygraph firmly in the former camp, though it pretends otherwise to the readers.</p> <p>Sure enough, today's Telegraph picks up the challenge, blaming Cable's own portfolio for admitted failures to achieve growth (George Osborne's bald spot is growing faster than the economy, the Times sketchwriter reports) and arguing that the coalition's Jeremiah should be retired. Having done its best to get him sacked for bad-mouthing Tory partners to a couple of wired Telegraph reporters in 2011, it's no surprise the paper is still on his case, ungrateful that his parallel rubbishing of Rupert Murdoch (the bit it covered up) has since been vindicated. Murdoch is mortally wounded.</p> <p>But enough of this playground squabbling. I do not know how Cable's letter (sent to David Cameron and Nick Clegg) came into the public domain, but it sounds more of a Lib Dem positioning \"leak\" that fell off the back of a party bus than a hostile leak by the Tories or Whitehall. Bits of it surfaced in the FT last month. Cable is 69 in May, and at that age most people are a bit demob happy, glad to be alive and busy. So they don't have much to lose.</p> <p>What Cable protests is several-fold. Like Steve Hilton, the departing Cameron strategist, he complains about a \"lack of vision\", easier said than achieved during a grim and protracted economic contraction that hovers like a storm cloud. Specifically he wants the Royal Bank of Scotland, struggling to defuse what its boss, Stephen Hester, calls the time bomb of bad debts, to be broken up, in part to create an industrial bank that lends to small business, inventors and entrepreneurs.</p> <p>We've tried this before and then, as so often, changed tack. When Churchill was chancellor in the 20s he protested that finance was too proud and industry too low, but didn't manage to face down the austere grandees of the Bank of England who bullied him into restoring the deflationary gold standard. That's roughly where we still are: a floating currency but banks that have behaved badly and are busy recapitalising themselves at the expense of customers (and industry) amid deflationary fiscal austerity.</p> <p>I have been in Birmingham this week and it's not hard to find complaints about London banks and London venture capitalists, indeed London government.

      "bodyText": "Interest rates in Britain could stay at their emergency level of 0.5% for a further three years, one of the UK's leading economic consultancies said on Wednesday. On the eve of the third anniversary of the Bank of England's decision to cut the cost of borrowing to the lowest level since it was founded in 1694, Capital Economics said the days of ultra-cheap money were here to stay. \"We think they (official interest rates) could stay at this level for another three years,\" said Vicky Redwood, the consultancy's chief UK economist. The Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee began a two-day meeting on Wednesday and is forecast to leave policy unchanged when it announces its decision on noon on Thursday. Financial markets currently do not expect Threadneedle Street to raise bank rate until the end of 2013, but Redwood said even this could be premature given the slow pace of the UK's economic recovery. When the Bank cut interest rates to 0.5% in March 2009 the expectation in the City was that the move would be short-lived, with borrowing costs back on the rise by early 2010 and reaching 3% by 2012. Redwood said: \"In contrast, we never predicted a rate rise over this period and said that rates could conceivably stay at their rock-bottom levels for five years. We thought that interest rates would need to stay low in response to a prolonged fiscal consolidation, weak bank lending and a sluggish economic recovery, all of which we have seen.\" She added that even a further three years of 0.5% bank rate might not be sufficient to generate a strong recovery, especially since higher funding costs for commercial banks were feeding through into more expensive mortgages. Further money creation through the quantitative easing programme was likely, Redwood said. Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"We lean towards the view that the Bank of England will do \u00a325bn more QE in May taking the total up to \u00a3350bn, although this could be delayed until August. Meanwhile, we are sticking to our view that interest rates will not rise until at least late-2013 and could very well stay put at 0.50% until 2014.\"",

Wilson, just 39 when he drowned in 1983, was a late-blooming but talented songwriter with a wonderfully gravelly voice, one formed in part by an infamous intake of booze and drugs. He contributed a fair smattering of Beach Boys songs but his wider skills are best showcased on Pacific Ocean Blue, a 1977 solo album that, despite critical acclaim, was unavailable for around 15 years. The Guardian's Richard Williams, who knows more about music than I ever will (in fact he knows more about everything) described Wilson's talents more fully when the album was finally reissued in 2008. Thoughts of You is my favourite from Pacific Ocean Blue and one of the most mournful, wistful (not to mention beautifully orchestrated) pop songs I know, as befits a composer who managed no fewer than five broken marriages, two to the same long-suffering woman.

      "bodyText": "A petition launched by an American teenager aimed at overturning the recent decision by US censors to hand a high-profile anti-bullying documentary a prohibitive rating has gained more than 200,000 signatures. High-school student Katy Butler, herself a victim of bullying, began gathering signatures just one week ago in response to the Motion Picture Association of America's (MPAA) move to hand Lee Hirsch's film Bully an R rating, which means many of its target audience will not be able to see it. The film's distributor, Oscar-winning producer Harvey Weinstein, has also been vocal in his disapproval of the decision, threatening to boycott the MPAA's ratings process in protest. Butler, from Ann Arbor, Michigan, is calling for the film to be given a PG rating, hand-delivering the signatures to the LA office of the MPAA today. Launching her Change.org online petition last month, she wrote: \"Because of the R rating, most kids won't get to see this film. No one under 17 will be allowed to see the movie, and the film won't be allowed to be screened in American middle schools or high schools.\" The MPAA's decision was made on the grounds of several uses of bad language during the film. There are said to be six instances of the word \"fuck\" being used in the documentary, which is due to open on 23 March in the US. Weinstein and his brother Bob, co-owners of the Weinstein Company, used a high-school shooting in suburban Cleveland last month in which a student, who was allegedly the victim of bullying, shot dead three other teenagers, as evidence that Bully ought to be seen by as wide an audience as possible. \"In light of the tragedy that occurred in Ohio, we feel now is the time for the bullying epidemic to take centre stage, we need to demand our community take action,\" they said in a statement. Bully follows students from schools in Texas, Mississippi, Georgia, Iowa and Oklahoma during the 2009 to 2010 school year, along with their families. A particular focus is on the deaths of Tyler Long and Ty Smalley, who killed themselves after being bullied. Many of those who have signed the petition said they had experienced bullying themselves. \"I wish I'd been able to see a film like this when I was in the eighth grade and being bullied,\" wrote Karen Howard in the comments section below Butler's petition. \"It is important for kids who are bullied to understand that they're not alone. And it's important for the bullies to see how wrong and destructive bullying is \u2013 to everyone. It diminishes the bullies and endangers the victims. This film should be shown in all middle and high schools. It can save lives. Is Bully any worse than the video games the under 17 crowd play? Get real!\"",

      "bodyText": "Five of the soldiers presumed killed in the Afghanistan explosion were from the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, an armoured infantry battalion equipped with the Warrior armoured vehicle. The Yorkshires are the last of the UK's traditional county regiments, with a history going back to 1685 and involving some of the British army's most famous names and battles. Terrible losses have been as much part of their story as glorious victories. Loyalty in their recruiting grounds, which now cover the whole of the north of England, has always been very strong. The archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, led tributes from Bishopthorpe palace, a mile from the 4th Battalion's headquarters at Worsley barracks in York. He said: \"We hold daily prayers for this regiment in our chapel at Bishopthorpe \u2013 indeed earlier this morning we were praying for all those serving in the regiment. My heart goes out to those affected; we will continue to pray for you. \"We owe a debt of gratitude to our brave soldiers, who are the best in the world. I am very saddened and my thoughts and prayers are with the families of these servicemen at this difficult time.\" The Conservative MP for Keighley, Kris Hopkins, a former Yorkshire soldier, said: \"I am absolutely devastated by this news. As a former member of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, I was invited to have lunch with officers of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment only two weeks ago in advance of their departure to Helmand. \"The loss of five men, together with a colleague from the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, is a devastating blow to everyone out there. My sympathies go out to them all and, most importantly, the families of those brave soldiers who have lost their lives serving our country. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten.\" The 3rd Battalion has borne much of the brunt of the fighting in Afghanistan as an armoured infantry unit, deploying in Warriors, from its base at Warminster in Wiltshire on the edge of the army's training grounds on Salisbury Plain. The battalion flew out to Afghanistan on 14 February after intensive training on Salisbury Plain, where facilities include mock-ups of villages and landscape in Helmand province. The current Yorkshires were formed from an amalgamation of celebrated units including the Green Howards, named after the northern dynasty whose mansions include Castle Howard. The regiment's colonel in chief is the Duke of York and its other name is the Duke's or the Duke of Wellington's, in honour of the great commander during the Napoleonic wars. Companies are named after people or events in the same way, including Corunna, the costly evacuation of the British army from Spain in 1808 at which the commander, Sir John Moore, was killed. Its motto is \"Fortune favours the brave\". The regiment's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Zak Stenning, told the Huddersfield Examiner before the battalion left last month: \"The troops have worked very hard over the past few months and they will be ready for this challenge. The Yorkshire soldier is unique; he is resilient, often outspoken but always determined.\" On 27 January, Lance Corporal Gajbahadur Gurung from the Royal Gurkha Rifles, serving with the Yorkshires' 1st Battalion, was shot dead when his foot patrol to disrupt insurgent activity came under small-arms fire in the Khar Nikah region of the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province. Private John King, from the same battalion, was killed on 30 December in the same area on a joint foot patrol with Afghan national security forces, and Private Matthew Thornton, from the 4th Battalion, died on 9 November when his foot patrol was hit by an improvised bomb.",

You snap a picture of a code and your mobile phone whisks you off to a web page \u2013 no typing necessary. The problem is that the vast majority of people have no idea what the codes are, or that they are supposed to interact with them. Most people look at a QR code and see \"robot barf\", but marketers seem to think they are a must-have technology for their advertising campaigns. In their minds, eager consumers wander around with their smartphones, scanning square codes wherever they appear. As a result, the codes appear just about everywhere, and often in some really absurd places. Being strangely fascinated by their misuse, we decided to collaborate on a Tumblr, wtfqrcodes, to document this ridiculous trend.

It's obvious that most companies just don't understand the technology ... and that's a recipe for some very funny posts. There seem to be a lot of QR codes in subway stations or on subway cars, where there's usually no mobile signal \u2013 and without a signal the codes are worthless.

It's pretty funny (and scary) to imagine someone driving down the road, one hand on the wheel, one on the phone, inching closer and closer to the vehicle in front of them so that they can scan a QR code. Then there are the roadside billboards where people are expected to scan a code from a moving car. Some of the most surprising places we've seen the codes appear are on tombstones, rooftops, cupcakes, and condoms. Our most popular post shows a small plane pulling a QR code across the sky.

French group Mr Bricolage said on Tuesday that it expected a slight increase in like for like sales in 2012, and this is proving helpful for Kingfisher. Analysts at Espirito Santo said: [The comments are] positive for Kingfisher as concern about the macro environment in France has been growing and led to fears that consensus forecasts are too optimistic; we forecast a flat like for like in France for the comparable year. We would expect Kingfisher to outperform Mr Bricolage given that it has been performing ahead of the market over the last 18 months and has better stock availability \u2013 Mr Bricolage has struggled with new laws that have improved supplier terms whilst Kingfisher's stronger balance sheet is better able to cope. Aside from this relatively positive top-line outlook, Kingfisher also has the benefits of its direct sourcing/common ranging/own label programs that should see further gross margin gains. Kingfisher is one of our top picks in the sector. Meanwhile Geoff Ruddell at Morgan Stanley has moved his recommendation on Kingfisher from equalweight to overweight, and raised his price target from 285p to 325p. He said the bank had met around 100 investors in the company in the past few weeks, and there were only two debates that really mattered: 1) Will its sourcing plans work? Kingfisher is unlikely to grow sales by more than 4% per annum in the next three years, so to hit its LTIP targets management will need to increase EBIT margins by a further 140 basis points. The key to this are its sourcing plans. We are increasingly confident that they will work (this time). 2) Will the French consumer 'crack'? There are some obvious macro-economic storm clouds building in France. However, we have built a household cashflow model that leads us to believe that any pressure on disposable incomes this year will be modest, whilst France already has one of the highest savings rates among developed economies. Although we downgrade our 2012/13 forecasts marginally, on currency, we now factor in sustained gross margin increases in both the UK and France, which drives up our longer-term forecasts and estimates of fair value. We recognize that the shares are unlikely to surge ahead until investors have more clarity on the French macro situation, but believe they represent an attractive long-term investment and, thus, raise our rating to overweight. All this has helped push Kingfisher shares up 3p to 277.5p.",

Potential highlights include 2 Days in New York, Julie Delpy's follow-up to her 2006 hit 2 Days in Paris, and Eugene Jarecki's award-winning drugs documentary The House I Live In. John Cooper, director of the Sundance film festival, explains that London was the obvious choice. \"We're a mission-driven organisation, so we are always looking to extend the audience for American independent films. London is the perfect venue. We have a long history with UK films, and probably show more British titles than any other films from outside the US. So there's a natural affinity. But I'm also interested to explore the differences between UK and US independent cinema.\" Assuming the London event is successful, Cooper isn't ruling out the prospect of rolling the Sundance brand out to other international venues. Sundance London kicks off on 26 April with an onstage conversation between Sundance founder Robert Redford and the musician T-Bone Burnett. The opening event sets the tone for a festival that offers a mix of movies and live performance. \"That was our one specific principle in arranging the schedule,\" says Trevor Groth, director of programming. \"We looked for films with a specific association with music. So we have Under African Skies, about Paul Simon's return to South Africa, and Shut Up and Play the Hits, the documentary about LCD Soundsystem.\" The schedule also makes room for a concert by Placebo as well as Tricky and Martina Topley-Bird's performance of their classic 1995 album Maxinquaye. Other films on the bill include Nobody Walks, Finding North, the acclaimed documentary The Queen of Versailles and An Oversimplification of Her Beauty, an eccentric psychological love story by the New York artist Terence Nance. Groth admits that the latter is one of his personal favourites. \"It's the film that truly shows what an independent voice can say,\" he says. \"Nance has taken live action and animation and he's merged all these styles to wonderfully good effect.\" Launched in 1978, the Sundance film festival remains the world's premiere showcase for independent cinema and has helped launch the careers of directors such as Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Darren Aronofsky and Quentin Tarantino. Despite criticism that the event has occasionally risked becoming a victim of its own success, the organisers feel that Sundance has largely managed to stay true to its roots. \"If you show interesting work, the rest corrects itself,\" insists Cooper. \"It really is that simple. I've been working at Sundance since 1989 and we've obviously seen a lot of changes in that time. But the mission has always stayed the same. It's a festival for artists who are outside the mainstream. Despite all the changes in exhibition and distribution, there is still something great about just getting people together in one place. That's why festivals still matter. It has to happen on a bricks-and-mortar, person-to-person basis. That's where the fresh ideas take root.\" The inaugural Sundance London film festival runs 26-29 April at the O2 arena.

      "bodyText": "Major airlines had their safest ever year in 2011, according to the industry's global trade body, with western jets suffering an accident every 2.7m flights. The International Air Transport Association said the accident rate for western-built jets, a market dominated by Airbus and Boeing, was the lowest in aviation history. The rate for hull losses, where the plane is written off or destroyed, was 0.37 per million flights or the equivalent of one serious incident per 2.7m trips. The rate has halved since 2005. Tony Tyler, Iata's chief executive, said: \"Safety is the air transport industry's number one priority. It is also a team effort. The entire stakeholder community \u2013 airlines, airports, air navigation service providers and safety regulators \u2013 works together every day to make the skies safer based on global standards. As a result, flying is one of the safest things that a person could do.\" Tyler added that the industry was still aiming for the \"ultimate goal\" of zero accidents. According to Iata, there were no hull losses for western-built jets in Europe, with the worst ratio emerging in the Middle East and Africa where there were two losses per million flights. Including eastern-built jets such as the Russian Tupolev, there were 486 fatalities in 2011 compared with 786 in 2010 \u2013 including a 2% fall in accidents from 94 to 92. Fatal crashes last year included the loss of an Iranair Boeing 727 near Orumiyeh in January, killing 77 people, a Hewa Bora Airways Boeing 727 that crashed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in July with 74 deaths, and the loss of a Yak-42 jet outside the Russian city of Yaroslavl in September, killing 43 people including members of the Russian major league ice hockey team Lokomotiv. The news on safety comes amid expectations that EADS, the parent of Airbus, will update investors on the cost of repairing a spate of wing cracks in the flagship A380 superjumbo at its results on Thursday. Airbus has stressed that the A380-related safety directives issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency in recent months are par for the course for a new commercial jet, but executives have admitted that it is an embarrassment for the aerospace giant.",

      "bodyText": "This was always going to be a tough gig for Valve. Counter-Strike is a PC legend; it is the game that turned first-person shooting from a sub-genre into a graceful virtual sport played by millions of dedicated enthusiasts. It is one of the most important titles in the FPS canon. But a lot has happened since Counter-Strike 1.6 hit mainstream gaming in 2003. Call of Duty and its contemporaries have introduced a new, more visceral strand of first-person action, not only with cinematic single-player modes, but also boasting highly regulated and feature-packed multiplayer. Suddenly, we had different classes of soldier, ranking, sprinting, kill streaks, automatic healing and the ability to aim down iron sights. The systems became more complex, more diverse while gameplay, conversely, became more instinctive, more twitchy. Then last year, Valve announced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a new take on the series for Xbox Live, PlayStation Network and PC. The game is being developed in conjunction with Hidden Path, the co-developer of 2004's CS re-build, Counter-Strike Source. And the big quandary is \u2013 do they go with the classic CS feel and appease hardcore fans at the expense of a mainstream audience, or do they make concessions to modernity and start adding stuff like sprinting, iron sight aiming and crawling around on the floor? Well, having played a demo at last week's Xbox Spring Showcase event, I can say it's a mix, definitely a mix \u2013 but the mix is weighed hugely in favour of the past. The set-up is super simple. Players get into two teams of five \u2013 terrorists vs counter-terrorists. One side has an objective it must complete, the other has to kill all the enemy operatives before they get to carry it out. In every session, teams play five rounds as terrorists and five as counters. The scores are added up for the overall winner. The action is fast and clinical. There are no re-spawns; if you're hit, you watch the rest of the game as a spectator (unless you have bots on your side, in which case you can choose to take over one of those). You can't crouch, you can't sprint. There is no down-the-sights aiming: hitting left trigger merely puts your character into a slightly lowered aiming stance. If you played Counter-Strike a lot five years ago, the muscle memory will exert itself within minutes. If you've grown up on Call of Duty, boy, are you going to struggle. The big new addition, perhaps, is the Arsenal mode. Based around the popular CS mod, Gun Game, players are given a better weapon after every kill, instead of purchasing equipment at the beginning of every round as in the classic CS format. Arsenal comes in two flavours, Arms Race, where it's just about taking out the enemy and Demolition, where there's an objective to complete. Interestingly, though, CS:GO reverses the usual arms escalation \u2013 here, you downgrade after every kill, working your way from assault rifle, through the P90, the shotgun and the Desert Eagle pistol and on to the lowly knife. \"This mode really simplifies the game,\" says Chet Faliszek. \"You're not buying weapons before rounds, you start with the best weapons and then you degrade, based on how well you're doing. So if you're not getting kills in the early rounds it's going to end up as you with an AK-47 versus a guy with a knife...\" Faliszek sees this as a leveller \u2013 a way of appealing to new players, without necessarily adding a lot of eye-catching fresh features from contemporary titles. The Arsenal mode also features its own new maps, which are designed \u2013 perhaps with a slight nod toward Modern Warfare - for tight, fast play. \"The maps are really small,\" says Faliszek. \"You can almost see the enemy from the get-go, so it's not about map knowledge, which is usually an advantage to veterans. If you play the classic map Dust, those guys know where to stand, where to fight \u2013 so we removed that advantage from Arsenal. These maps are so tight, you're really quickly into the action. Within ten seconds you're firing.\" Indeed, I played the Lake map, which features a lakehouse and a semi-built property next door, all condensed within a confined area of flat grassland, boasting a couple of rocky outcrops for cover. The terrorists have to get the bomb to a room on the first floor of the house, and there are several entry points, including via a boathouse at the bottom, as well as through the building and up via an external staircase. It's all about securing the best positions within the house as soon as possible, with four terrorists gaining an over-watch of the exterior and the staircases, allowing the guy with the explosives to plant 'em in peace. Pinpoint planning and execution are key. \"At Valve, we've seen that it's all really quick,\" says Faliszek. \"It's like basketball, where you make place calls about what you're going to try to do, 'we're going to sweep right', or 'we'll come through this entrance'; it all happens really fast. And you quickly pick up on how it works.\" Meanwhile, the Classic mode will feature several familiar maps such as Dust and Inferno. \"We have two modes per map,\" says Faliszek. \"One is casual, it's sort of a laidback environment so you can play a match with friends; the other is competitive, and that has skill-based matchmaking. \"When we made Counter-Strike Source we had a problem with how we could add a bunch of difficulty for the really skilled players without ruining the experience for newcomers. So the skill-based matchmaking ensures that, while you're learning, you're not playing against people who already know. But as you get better, you compete against more skilled players - it lets us have a higher skill ceiling and a lower skill floor.\" Again, then, CS:GO is about tweaking the structure of the classic gameplay to help new players, rather than adding modern elements to make them feel more at home. Faliszek did say that there would also be a training element in the game, but re-iterated that it would be more about gently easing gamers in with well-balanced matches. As for progression, there will be no ranking up, but successful competitors will be able to earn awards for performance, as in Team Fortress 2. \"Players like to know how they're doing, how they're improving\" says Faliszek. \"So we have these things we're introducing, they're like mini-achievements that get ranked up and scored. But those don't effect what weapons you get - they're just for you to take a look at to understand how you're improving.\" Boasting 16 maps, some new, some fresh, and that interesting matchmaking system, CS:GO is due out in the summer-ish. \"We're letting the beta drive that,\" says Faliszek. \"We also have a lot of the pros playing it and we're making adjustments based on their feedback.\" It seems that while classic maps aren't going to be changed, the structure of the game is definitely being tweaked as a result of the ongoing beta play. Originated as a fan modification, CS has always been about community feedback. Visually, Global Offensive sort of reminds me of Battlefield 1943 \u2013 I don't mean in terms of actual look, I mean as a modernised take on the graphical fidelity of old. Character models are detailed, and landscapes are cluttered with props, but we're not getting cutting edge lighting and texture effects here. The game has a stately, serious look, befitting its past, its heritage. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, well, Counter-Strike. Until recently, the most played first-person shooter online, and still surely the professional competitive game of choice. As Faliszek says, it's more like a sport than a game, and you don't change the rules of a sport that often; players need to learn to compete within its confines. And from the looks of things, many, many hours of engrossing education await you.",

Arsenal comes in two flavours, Arms Race, where it's just about taking out the enemy and Demolition, where there's an objective to complete. </p> <p>Interestingly, though, CS:GO reverses the usual arms escalation \u2013 here, you downgrade after every kill, working your way from assault rifle, through the P90, the shotgun and the Desert Eagle pistol and on to the lowly knife. \"This mode really simplifies the game,\" says Chet Faliszek. \"You're not buying weapons before rounds, you start with the best weapons and then you degrade, based on how well you're doing. So if you're not getting kills in the early rounds it's going to end up as you with an AK-47 versus a guy with a knife...\"</p> <p>Faliszek sees this as a leveller \u2013 a way of appealing to new players, without necessarily adding a lot of eye-catching fresh features from contemporary titles. The Arsenal mode also features its own new maps, which are designed \u2013 perhaps with a slight nod toward Modern Warfare - for tight, fast play.</p> <p>\"The maps are <em>really</em> small,\" says Faliszek. \"You can almost see the enemy from the get-go, so it's not about map knowledge, which is usually an advantage to veterans. If you play the classic map Dust, those guys know where to stand, where to fight \u2013 so we removed that advantage from Arsenal. These maps are so tight, you're really quickly into the action. Within ten seconds you're firing.\"</p> <p>Indeed, I played the Lake map, which features a lakehouse and a semi-built property next door, all condensed within a confined area of flat grassland, boasting a couple of rocky outcrops for cover. The terrorists have to get the bomb to a room on the first floor of the house, and there are several entry points, including via a boathouse at the bottom, as well as through the building and up via an external staircase. </p> <p>It's all about securing the best positions within the house as soon as possible, with four terrorists gaining an over-watch of the exterior and the staircases, allowing the guy with the explosives to plant 'em in peace. Pinpoint planning and execution are key. \"At Valve, we've seen that it's all really quick,\" says Faliszek. \"It's like basketball, where you make place calls about what you're going to try to do, 'we're going to sweep right', or 'we'll come through this entrance'; it all happens really fast. And you quickly pick up on how it works.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Classic mode will feature several familiar maps such as Dust and Inferno. \"We have two modes per map,\" says Faliszek. \"One is casual, it's sort of a laidback environment so you can play a match with friends; the other is competitive, and that has skill-based matchmaking. </p> <p>\"When we made Counter-Strike Source we had a problem with how we could add a bunch of difficulty for the really skilled players without ruining the experience for newcomers. So the skill-based matchmaking ensures that, while you're learning, you're not playing against people who already know. But as you get better, you compete against more skilled players - it lets us have a higher skill ceiling and a lower skill floor.\"</p> <p>Again, then, CS:GO is about tweaking the structure of the classic gameplay to help new players, rather than adding modern elements to make them feel more at home. Faliszek did say that there would also be a training element in the game, but re-iterated that it would be more about gently easing gamers in with well-balanced matches. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387016706\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331120941793/csgo_lake.gif\" alt=\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As for progression, there will be no ranking up, but successful competitors will be able to earn awards for performance, as in Team Fortress 2. \"Players like to know how they're doing, how they're improving\" says Faliszek. \"So we have these things we're introducing, they're like mini-achievements that get ranked up and scored. But those don't effect what weapons you get - they're just for you to take a look at to understand how you're improving.\"</p> <p>Boasting 16 maps, some new, some fresh, and that interesting matchmaking system, CS:GO is due out in the summer-ish. \"We're letting the beta drive that,\" says Faliszek. \"We also have a lot of the pros playing it and we're making adjustments based on their feedback.\" It seems that while classic maps aren't going to be changed, the structure of the game is definitely being tweaked as a result of the ongoing beta play. Originated as a fan modification, CS has always been about community feedback.</p> <p>Visually, Global Offensive sort of reminds me of Battlefield 1943 \u2013 I don't mean in terms of actual look, I mean as a modernised take on the graphical fidelity of old. Character models are detailed, and landscapes are cluttered with props, but we're not getting cutting edge lighting and texture effects here. The game has a stately, serious look, befitting its past, its heritage. </p> <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, well, Counter-Strike. Until recently, the most played first-person shooter online, and still surely the professional competitive game of choice. As Faliszek says, it's more like a sport than a game, and you don't change the rules of a sport that often; players need to learn to compete within its confines. And from the looks of things, many, many hours of engrossing education await you.</p>",

The first delivery was spot-on, bang on length and line and, on pitching, it jagged back sharply off the seam and sank into the unprotected inside of the thigh of the batsman pushing forward. The next was all but identical (the pitch marks, scarred on the grass, were within six inches of one another) and again the batsman came forward at it. Only this time he changed his mind midway, shifted his weight on to the back foot, and, clean as you like, thumped it with a vertical bat and high elbow not just over mid-off, or even the boundary rope, but over the corner of what is now the Compton stand and on to the Nursery. It remains the single most devastating shot I have ever seen. And Vivian Richards played a few in his time. What would he be worth today? It is more than a year since last I saw him. Or rather he saw me, across an airport transit lounge, me en route to the Ashes, he for a tour of King and I shows with Rodney Hogg. \"Hey Selve, what's happening, man?\" He looked dapper, a porkpie hat perched rakishly in place of the familiar maroon cap, a little thicker round the face but still that Big Bad John \"kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip\" appearance that made him look as much like a top middleweight as the greatest batsman of the modern era. Even as he reaches three score years on Wednesday, he looks fighting fit. So, from Singapore to Sydney, we supped a little and chewed the fat. There were things I wanted to ask him that I never had. Which of all the great West Indies fast bowlers of his time would he pick for his dream quartet? Andy Roberts, he said, his fellow Antiguan with an astounding cricket brain who was there at the start of it all; and the brilliant, much-lamented Malcolm Marshall. Then came Mikey, the great svelte Holding. And finally not the rumbling faithful Big Bird Joel Garner, but instead the brooding stringbean Curtly Ambrose. But, Richards admitted further, if he wanted someone to blast him a wicket, without fear, favour or consequence, there was none more chilling than Colin Croft. Now tell me, I asked him, since it's a long time over, how do you think that bowlers \u2013 or specifically, me \u2013 should have approached the task of bowling to you. I had successes, but generally they would have been early on in an innings as he sought the upper hand and took calculated risks. Hard graft after that. You had to be aggressive, he said with some passion, aggressive. It mattered not if fast, slow or medium, spin, swing or seam, you had to demonstrate positive intent or you were shot from the start. When, after he took guard, he wandered down the pitch, tilted his head back and, looking down his aquiline nose to eyeball the bowler, it was almost as if he was sniffing the air through his flared nostrils for the scent of fear. He wanted to feel the ball \"sweet\" off the bat from the off, and then he knew it was his day. Yeah aggressive, he repeated, he respected that. But this was always easier said than done because of the way he set it up. There is an analogy with the buzz in a theatre before the curtain goes up on a great thespian. The wicket falls, but he allowed things to settle, waiting for the arena to clear, the celebrations (more muted in those days) to die down. The theatre lights dimmed and expectation became electricity. Everyone knew who was coming. And when he finally made his entrance, swaggering down the steps, cudding his gum, and windmilling his bat gently, first one arm then the other, it was a personification of grace and menace combined, the walk as unmistakable as had been that of Garry Sobers, to my mind his only rival as the finest postwar batsman of them all. I put on a performance, he told me, it was part of my act. He wanted to dominate and the genesis of that process happened even before he closed the dressing-room door behind him. His reputation preceded him like an advance guard. It continued with the languid wicketwards saunter, the slow precision with which he took guard, the way he ambled down the pitch to tap down an imaginary mark, all the while looking for, and not always finding, eye contact with his adversary. Then he would smack the end of his bat handle with the palm of his right hand, a final intimidatory gesture. There have been giants of the game contemporary and since, batsmen of vast pedigree and achievement: Greg Chappell, Lara, Tendulkar, Ponting, Dravid, Kallis, Sangakkara, Hayden and others. Each on his day could reduce an attack to rubble. But Richards had an aura given to no other. Truly he was scary. Happy birthday, Viv.",

      "bodyText": "The third coming of the iPad is upon us. Details of its new features are beginning to leak, from high-definition zoom to the disappearance of the home button and the appearance of Siri, iPhone's speaking personal assistant. Whatever the commandments written into Apple's latest tablet, \"thou shalt have the option to purchase a subsidised iPad 3 from your mobile network\" is unlikely to be among them. The first iPad appeared in February 2010, and dozens of Android-based tablets have launched since, but UK network operators have not embraced them as they have the smartphone. Why have the likes of O2 and Vodafone shown so little interest in promoting devices designed to run on their networks, which could in theory lure customers to spend hundreds of pounds more each year on data plans? The simplest answer is that while phones have made Apple rich, they have begun to eat into the fat profit margins of mobile networks. Tablets only reinforce that pattern. As one network executive put it, with the iPad, \"all you are doing is subsidising Apple\". The iPad has found 55 million buyers worldwide without help from the networks so far. The market has been created without their help. Phone calls and texts are good money earners because they run on the old 2G networks, long since built and paid for. But smartphone customers are swapping calls and texts for internet services. These run on 3G networks, which require a big investment each year to accommodate the explosion in traffic \u2013 up 250% over the last two years. And the speeds offered are still much slower than home broadband. Until networks spend billions more upgrading to 4G, using a tablet for watching films or playing video games, and all the other data hungry media it was designed for, will be a more enjoyable experience on Wi-Fi until truly fast mobile broadband is up and running some time at the end of 2013. Tablet customers have no need at all for calls and texts. So there is limited profit to be shared with the customer in lowering the price of the device. O2 does not subsidise tablets. Vodafone stocks two brands, Apple and Samsung. Its iPad 2 costs \u00a3229 upfront plus a two-year contract at \u00a327 a month. The Vodafone price adds up to \u00a3877 over two years, for 2GB of data a month. At that price, it's obvious there is no subsidy in Vodafone's offer. In fact buying direct from the Apple store is cheaper. The basic 3G tablet is \u00a3499, while 2GB of data will set you back \u00a315 at month at O2, adding up to \u00a3859 over two years. Three's deal, from \u00a3229 up front and \u00a315 a month and a 15GB data allowance, is the only true subsidy. That adds up to a cheaper than the rest \u00a3589. But Three happily admits that most of its iPad customers are bringing their own kit to the network. Apple does not cut networks any special slack on wholesale prices. The networks make money selling the data plans, not the hardware. There is also customer reluctance. Technology changes so quickly, people are reluctant to sign two separate 24-month contracts, one for the tablet and another for their normal phone. What they want is a single data subscription shared between all devices \u2013 from the laptop dongle to the phone. So far, of the big players only Orange has stepped into this new tariff zone. It will sell both devices \u2013 an iPad and iPhone \u2013 for an initial \u00a399, plus \u00a365 a month for two years for 2GB of data, 600 minutes and unlimited texts. That amounts to a racy \u00a31,659 over the two years. But its multi-device offer is limited to a small range of products including Apple's. The word on the street is that multi-device plans are coming from other operators this year, but until they do, tablets are likely to remain peripheral. Given the expense of the 3G data plans, most consumers will find it easier to connect to the internet on their tablets via Wi-Fi. The danger then is that as urban availability of free or cheap Wi-Fi spreads, a new generation of customers could grow up with a new generation of devices that don't rely on mobile phone masts to stay connected. The network operators could themselves become peripheral.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Carrick has accepted that Manchester United must pick up their faltering European home form if they are to progress against Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League \u2013 a competition they are \"desperate\" to win. United are playing in the second-tier competition due to managing victory over only Otelul Galati at Old Trafford in the Champions League group stage. Sir Alex Ferguson's team play Bilbao on Thursday in Manchester in the first leg of the last-16 tie having lost 2-1 to Ajax at home in the second leg of the previous round to go through 3-2 on aggregate. Carrick said: \"I'm not sure why our home form in Europe has not been so good. It's a tough one. We haven't quite performed on the night for whatever reason. Compared to recent years, when our home form has been formidable, it hasn't quite happened for us this year. That's the reason why we're talking about the Europa League. The Ajax game was a bit of a disappointment but we got through. We can put that behind us and look forward. \"Bilbao is a tough place to go. We need to perform well at home to give us a chance in the away leg. Most of the time in recent years we've tended to play the away leg first. That will be something different for us. It won't change our approach hugely but we know how tough it will be over there. It is renowned to be a very hostile environment. They have fanatical fans but it's something we're looking forward to.\" Carrick is adamant that United are intent on winning the competition. \"It is still a European competition. It is one we are desperate to win. We have never really been part of it. Who knows when the chance to win it will come round again? We want to grasp it. As players and as a club we are determined to go far. \"It is not difficult to think we want to win it. It is understandable the reaction people give you and how people see it, but we are professionals and we are in this tournament, playing for this great club. It doesn't take much motivation from the players' point of view. It's a competition we want to win. I want to win it. I've never played in this competition. We are still desperate to go as far as we would do in the Champions League.\" Paul Scholes was the most notable absentee from training on Wednesday ahead of the tie. His fellow midfielder Tom Cleverley did take part though, suggesting a potential comeback after his recent ankle injury. Chris Smalling seemed to have recovered from the head wound he sustained on England duty. There was no sign of Michael Owen, and Antonio Valencia trained on his own as he continues his recovery from a hamstring strain. The youngster Paul Pogba was training with the reserves who were not involved in Tuesday's second-string match against West Brom, further fuelling reports he has agreed to join Juventus in the summer.",

      "bodyText": "When should people suspected of committing a crime in the course of exercising their right to public protest be prosecuted? That is the question the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Keir Starmer QC has set out to answer. But his guidelines to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) threaten our right to protest, which is protected under the Human Rights Act 1998, particularly in view of questionable police practices at public demonstrations. The decision to prosecute a case is based on whether the CPS considers there is a realistic prospect for conviction as well as whether prosecution is in the public interest. According to the new guidelines, certain factors make it \"more likely\" that prosecuting a protester will be considered to be in the public interest. Starmer's hope is that his guidance will help prosecutors \"differentiate between violent or disruptive offenders\" and those \"whose intent was \u2026 peaceful\". He mistakenly assumes that people come to public protests with either peaceful or violent intentions. In fact, \"violence\" often flows from police \"crowd-control\" tactics at demonstrations, such as kettling, the use of batons, agents provocateurs and undercover policing, all of which have been deployed with increasing frequency in recent years. This is particularly problematic because, in court, defendants cannot invoke \"the atmosphere of the day\" in explaining their behaviour. According to the DPP, \"prosecutors should have particular regard to whether \u2026 a person had come to the protest equipped with \u2026 items that could be considered body protection\" as this \"may indicate \u2026 anticipation of disorder\". In light of the widespread use of police batons, protesters who wish to exercise their right to voice dissent whilst also protecting themselves should not face a higher risk of prosecution by doing so. The idea that suspects \"in possession of a weapon at the time of the offence\" should face a greater likelihood of prosecution raises the question of what is to be considered a \"weapon\". The category of \"weapon\", as opposed to \"offensive weapon\", is so broad as to cover practically anything. My shoe could be a weapon if I beat someone with it. A term so broad contravenes the principle of legal certainty. Clarity is crucial in order for citizens to be able to regulate their behaviour. Is a drinks flask a weapon? Or a placard? The point is we don't know. In July last year, Frances Fernie, 20, was sentenced to 12 months in a young offenders' institution for throwing two placard sticks, which hit nobody. Under the DPP's guidelines, prosecution is less likely where an act was committed \"in the heat of the moment\". Fernie argued in court that his behaviour was \"a moment of hot-headedness\" and the judge accepted that he had been \"caught up in the heat of the moment\". As Defend the Right to Protest has argued, Fernie should never have been prosecuted. It is crucial to get the decision on prosecution right because for protesters, a conviction is the end of life as they know it. The guidelines indicate that where suspects take \"steps to conceal their identity\", prosecution will be more likely. Not only does this seem ridiculous if we consider mid-winter demonstrations \u2013 I myself have wrapped a scarf around my face when demonstrating in cold weather \u2013 but it also raises serious concerns in view of police tactics. The systematic police practice of videoing public protests and releasing stills to the media means it is scarcely surprising that demonstrators might wish to hide their identities. Worse, when individuals, confronted with their image in the media and keen to clear their names, come forward, they are swiftly arrested and charged with public order offences. Such retroactive policing was common following the riots last summer and the student demonstrations of 2010. These individuals then find it difficult to defend themselves in a political climate that is becoming more hostile towards dissent. Given police tactics of baiting protesters, it is not clear why \"significant damage\" being \"caused to property\" should make prosecution more likely. At a student demonstration in November 2010, the police parked a van amid protesters. The police must have known that frustrations brought about by their crowd-control techniques would be directed against the abandoned vehicle. In view of such police tactics, damage to property in the course of public protest is not necessarily a sound basis for considering prosecution of protesters to be in the public interest. Revealingly, Starmer foresees the \"potential for a number of protests over the coming years that may be quite large\". Is there not a risk that the grounds he lists for increasing the likelihood of prosecution will reduce the chances of such protests materialising? For there is no hiding the fact that these guidelines are to serve as warnings to those wishing to participate in demonstrations in the future. \"Significant disruption\" being caused to the \"public and businesses\" is now to enhance the likelihood of prosecution. Is it possible to imagine a successful demonstration that does not cause considerable levels of disruption? Not only is the closing of major roads, bridges and shopping streets inevitably disruptive, but this guideline seems to be designed to deter protests against corporate greed of the kind seen at Fortnum &amp; Mason last year. If a placard can be considered a weapon, and a scarf evidence of intent to cause \"trouble or disorder\", if protesters' organising on social network sites are to be monitored by authorities, and protesters filmed by police whether they are engaging in illicit activity or not, is there not a danger that protesters will be dissuaded from exercising their right to public protest? Probably not, because we're made of thicker skin than that, but we could be forgiven for concluding that these guidelines are part of a broader effort to suppress dissent. What is clear is that the right to protest is in need of defending more than ever before. \u2022 This article was amended at 13:29 on 7 March 2012. It originally stated that the student protesters amid whom police parked a van in November 2010 \"were cold, thirsty and tired after hours in a 'kettle'\". This is incorrect and has now been removed",

Such retroactive policing was common following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-riots\" title=\"\">riots last summer</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/nov/10/student-protest-fees-violent\" title=\"\">student demonstrations</a> of 2010.</p> <p>These individuals then find it difficult to defend themselves in a political climate that is becoming more hostile towards dissent.</p> <p>Given police tactics of baiting protesters, it is not clear why \"significant damage\" being \"caused to property\" should make prosecution more likely. At a student demonstration in November 2010, the police parked a van amid protesters. The police must have known that frustrations brought about by their crowd-control techniques would be directed against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/13/protesters-students-uk-megan-thomas\" title=\"\">abandoned vehicle</a>. In view of such police tactics, damage to property in the course of public protest is not necessarily a sound basis for considering prosecution of protesters to be in the public interest.</p> <p>Revealingly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/06/masked-protesters-cps?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Starmer foresees</a> the \"potential for a number of protests over the coming years that may be quite large\". Is there not a risk that the grounds he lists for increasing the likelihood of prosecution will reduce the chances of such protests materialising? For there is no hiding the fact that these guidelines are to serve as warnings to those wishing to participate in demonstrations in the future. \"Significant disruption\" being caused to the \"public and businesses\" is now to enhance the likelihood of prosecution. Is it possible to imagine a successful demonstration that does not cause considerable levels of disruption? Not only is the closing of major roads, bridges and shopping streets inevitably disruptive, but this guideline seems to be designed to deter protests against corporate greed of the kind seen at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/17/fortnum-mason-verdict-uk-uncut-protesters\" title=\"\">Fortnum &amp; Mason</a> last year.</p> <p>If a placard can be considered a weapon, and a scarf evidence of intent to cause \"trouble or disorder\", if protesters' organising on social network sites are to be monitored by authorities, and protesters filmed by police whether they are engaging in illicit activity or not, is there not a danger that protesters will be dissuaded from exercising their right to public protest? Probably not, because we're made of thicker skin than that, but we could be forgiven for concluding that these guidelines are part of a broader effort to suppress dissent. What is clear is that the right to protest is in need of defending more than ever before.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended at 13:29 on 7 March 2012. It originally stated that the student protesters amid whom police parked a van in November 2010 \"were cold, thirsty and tired after hours in a 'kettle'\". This is incorrect and has now been removed</p>",

The Trading Standards Institute revealed in December 2011 that older people were being targeted by rogue telephone salespeople selling electric plug-in gadgets for \u00a399 which they claimed could save up to 40% on energy bills. Trading standards tested the devices and found they failed to reduce energy consumption and put buyers at risk of fire or electrocution. Trading Standards is now warning that the same people are being cold-called a second time by bogus \"claims management companies\", offering to procure up to \u00a33,000 in compensation in return for an initial outlay of \u00a3300. The representative of the company tells the consumer the energy savings device they bought is unsafe and they have a cheque of up to \u00a33,000 in compensation for them. The consumer is instructed to purchase a Ukash voucher for approximately \u00a3300 to cover administration fees, and to call the claims management company back with the voucher code. But victims who have purchased the voucher have failed to receive their compensation cheque. Sue Jones from Westminster Council's Trading Standards said: \"Just like with the first scam where consumers are cold-called to buy the energy savings device, the caller appears very credible and has a lot of information about the person they are calling. \"Victims have told us the caller claims to be working in conjunction with the 'Fair Trading people' and in some instances even names the company that originally sold them the device,\" she said. The claims management company gives Park Royal, London NW10 as its address \u2013 but these premises are vacant. Trading standards says the original scam is also continuing \u2013 it is still receiving reports of fraudsters selling the energy saving plug-in devices using a new name, ITS Development, supposedly based in Broadwick Street, London W1. The occupant of these premises, however, has no connection with the scam. Jones said: \"We want to remind consumers that these devices we are investigating don't in fact offer any energy savings \u2013 it is a complete fraud.\" Ron Gainsford, the Trading Standards Institute's chief executive, said: \"We are very concerned about the way these criminals are now targeting their past victims, taking advantage of the publicity given to their original scam, while continuing to lure in cash-strapped consumers with their promise of energy savings. \"We'd urge consumers not to hand over money to anyone who asks for an upfront payment before awarding compensation \u2013 this is a classic scam scenario used by criminals in different guises; they dangle a carrot to obtain some money from the consumer and then vanish. Genuine companies would never ask for money up front before handing over compensation.\" Trading standards urges anyone who has been contacted in connection with either the original energy saving device scam or the fraudulent offer of compensation to contact their local trading standards officers.",

The production complex's closure was announced last month when the company owning it went into administration after losing \u00a3400,000 in 2010-11. In an statement to the Guardian, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said: \"While the closure will be a loss to the film industry, this is a commercial decision made by a private company, and the government has no remit to intervene.\" Gerald Krasner, the administrator handling the closure, said at the time: \"I doubt it will be retained as a film studio \u2026 we are selling it on.\" It later emerged that building firm Taylor Wimpey was in discussions to acquire the site and redevelop it as a \"mixed-use scheme\". Daniel Cormack, organiser of the Save Twickenham Film Studios campaign, said: \"There is massive local opposition and uproar in the film industry that yet another integral part of our cultural heritage could be sold to developers.\" An online petition has attracted over 2,600 signatures. Cormack's request to meet with Jeremy Hunt is \"currently being considered\", according to the DCMS. Twickenham Film Studios was originally built in 1913 and over the decades many classic films have been made there, including The Italian Job, Repulsion, Let It Be, Blade Runner and An American Werewolf in London. Recent productions to have used the facility include The Iron Lady and My Week with Marilyn.",

      "bodyText": "As the buzz around last week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona subsides, some are questioning its future. Despite 60,000 attendees, dozens of launches, announcements and keynotes from industry luminaries there is a feeling that the real action is elsewhere. We did see the arrival of the Chinese devices giants Huawei and ZTE \u2013 already major players in unbranded phones and with clear ambitions to build strong brands. But Samsung chose not to announce their next Galaxy smartphone \u2013 instead planning to launch on Twitter in the next few days. And Apple \u2013 as ever \u2013 didn't show up but stole attention anyway with the news of their event on 7 March, which is rumoured to be the launch of the iPad3. Google, Facebook and Amazon, the companies who essentially run mobile and digital, don't take MWC that seriously. Facebook did announce their support for mobile web apps and HTML5 \u2013 which is going to be very significant over the next couple of years. But their key people were in New York selling their new advertising model to Madison Avenue. Google invested heavily in support of Android and mobilised the sites of many of Barcelona's tourist attractions. But Apple and Amazon weren't there and few of the startups that generate so much of the energy in mobile showed up either. The operators \u2013 the people that used to drive the industry, and who still have the power to generate huge momentum in mobile \u2013 were (predictably) there in force. There are signs that, having been written off as dumb pipes by many, some operators are looking for ways to reclaim their throne. With their revenues under pressure from new legislation (significant cuts to roaming charges and lower termination rates) and changes in behaviour (leading to a $14bn (\u00a38.8bn) hole in SMS income) they need to evolve their business models. With huge customer bases, a billing relationship with millions and control of the plumbing that makes mobile work, operators should be able to compete with the big players such as Google and Apple. They have the potential, and the marketing budgets, to take useful mobile services mass market. Project Oscar \u2013 where the key operators plan to collaborate on a mobile wallet (subject to regulator approval) \u2013 is a good start but doesn't seem to be solving the right problem. Why can't operators use their size and customer knowledge to create the context where a mobile wallet is truly helpful? How about EverythingEverywhere helping to improve their customers' social lives? FourSquare is hugely influential but has just 15 million users. Why doesn't Everything Everywhere take lessons from FourSquare, Gowalla, Path and others to create a mass market service for people to share their social life using photos and locations. Build in ways that Everything Everywhere customers can invite their friends on other networks, but reducing the utility for non-customers. So, on a night out, their customers can find friends and share where they are and where they are going next. Layer on offers from bars, clubs and cinemas that are actioned through the wallet, and you have a social tool that can drive revenue and reduce churn. And give those on other networks a compelling reason to switch. Diageo did this sort of thing 10 years too early with NightFly. What about O2 making shopping a better experience? One idea is a mobile service where customers can scan a barcode on any product, read reviews, check the green footprint and compare prices. On food products, they can check health information such as calories and whether it contains trans fats. They could also create a mobile loyalty service for small shops where customers can check in with their mobiles to receive offers tailored to their preferences. I suspect that fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brands would love a way to target offers and coupons that isn't controlled by the supermarkets. This creates real context for a mobile wallet. Similarily, can Vodafone make our commute better? Information on buses and trains is available in real-time in most cities and towns; so why not develop a mobile service that knows where you are and gives you the information you need; the time of the next bus at this bus stop, whether the next train is on time etc. Add in the ability to share your location and speed when driving (hands-free of course) and Vodafone has a crowdsourced traffic service sharing delays and issues on the roads. All they need then is a way for customers to quickly and easily order a taxi \u2013 and pay for it on their mobile bill. Some of these services already exist but have small user bases and tend to be standalone rather than converged services. They have huge potential outside of early adopters and operators are perfectly positioned to help them cross the chasm. These sorts of service are a natural extension of the original business model of an operator \u2013 services for their customers that maximise use of their networks and drive additional revenues and reduce churn. They would differentiate an operator more effectively than their latest 30-second TVC. One argument against these initiatives is that they could work better if available to everyone, rather than just customers of one network. Which is true, but we have an emerging industry that is largely about peddling these sort of ideas to customers of just one device manufacturer. And the three big operators each have around twice as many customers as Apple does in the UK. Given that operators spend about $350 to acquire each new customer perhaps they should make these services available to everyone and use them as a smarter way to recruit new customers. It's easy to identify the operator and device of users, so very relevant offers can be delivered as advertising. Operators have a huge opportunity and it's time for them to step up \u2013 or leave these converged services to Google, Facebook and Amazon, and just accept playing the role of a dumb pipe.

      "bodyText": "Last week we trained 18 people to shoot, edit and produce video at the Guardian Media Academy. In that same week, another 254 people joined www.nyvs.com, our online video training site. That's not a lot when you consider the magnitude of what we are trying to accomplish. This is not about teaching people to make video. This is a revolution in literacy \u2013 video literacy. We are, today, a society that is defined by video. It is, for better or for worse, the lingua franca of our culture. The average American or European spends five hours a day watching videos, either on TV or online. That number is primed to get much bigger as video migrates to the web. Video is the way that we, increasingly, communicate stories, news, information and even ideas to one another. It's powerful because it often transcends barriers of language and of culture. It is universal and powerful. It drives everything from politics to religion, and much in between. Yet the vast majority of the population (on the order of 99.99%) is and remains largely video illiterate. That is, while they can watch video, they cannot create it. It means they're cut off from participating in creating the very elements of our public discourse, as well as our entertainment. They are, in effect, second-class citizens. What's worse is that we are all the poorer as a culture when we place this incredibly powerful medium in the hands of a select (or self-selected) few. It's a crazy and terribly destructive thing to do. So no, we are not teaching people a skill; we are teaching them to participate in the formation of our culture, instead of being simply passive observers. There's an old printing press in the main hall of the Guardian's offices at Kings Place. It's an interesting choice of decoration. The morning after the printing press was invented in 1452, there was almost no one in Europe who was literate. Literacy was then the purview of a tiny and elite fraction of the population. The great and vast majority of the world was incapable of reading and writing. So while the printing press was a wonderful machine for democratising learning and ideas, it had to go hand and hand with a rather rapid process of teaching people to read and write, and empowering them with the idea that they could do this, that it was, in fact, both their right and responsibility. This transformation took several hundred years, and not an insignificant amount of blood was shed in its defence. Today, we live in a world where print literacy \u2013 the ability to read and write \u2013 is viewed as a fundamental unifying principle of our culture. We teach people to write in school, not in the hope they might one day earn a living as writers, but so they might fully contribute to culture as a whole. Now, as we move rapidly from a print-based to culture to a video-based culture, it's equally important that we teach people how to communicate their ideas in video. Not so that they might one day earn a living as cameramen (though they might), but so that they might craft their ideas in the medium in which we are all increasingly communicating.

From Gaucho leathers to luxe, silk-printed, eastern-inspired eveningwear, the latest collection embodied a relaxed, mannish chic. But perhaps the most noticeable element of the H\u00e9rmes show was the diverse casting of models. They included Alek Wek, Liu Wen, Marie-Sophie Wilson, Cecilia Chancellor and 52-year-old Bambou, widow of Serge Gainsbourg, who closed the show to much applause, not least from another Gainsbourg ex, a smiling Jane Birkin, seated front row",

      "bodyText": "Most universities derive income from a broad range of sources, such as knowledge transfer, commercial operations, public-private partnerships and philanthropic giving. The latest HESA Finance data (2008/09) shows that 'other income' comprised close to 20%, or nearly \u00a35 billion, of total UK HEI income. There seems little doubt that financial pressures in future will increase, as funding body grants reduce, tuition fee income becomes less stable and the demands to pay for new and better facilities continue to grow. And then there's the pension fund liabilities. A well-structured and resourced strategic marketing team is essential help to any institution decide where the best opportunities for developing new income streams lie. In many organisations, marketing either encompasses or sits alongside business development and its processes and disciplines can help the development team structure its approach. In an academic environment, many of the ideas for new businesses and incomes will emerge from academic staff engaged in research. Marketing can add value by helping staff turn their ideas into to fully fledged business propositions, well positioned to take advantage of the market opportunities available. Support for business development An experienced marketing team, with a strategic capability, can add value to business development in a number of ways: A well-structured market assessment process will help identify \u2022 Who are the potential customers? \u2022 Where is the competition and what are they offering? \u2022 How does our proposition stack up against others? \u2022 What is the scale of the market? \u2022 What market trends are apparent? When developing a proposition the university must take into account market demand, feasibility and sustainable competitive advantage. A full marketing launch takes careful planning and execution. The marketing and communications team can help staff plan how to get from a proposition, idea or prototype to a full marketing launch. They should also be able to advise on the on-going level of resource needed to manage engagement with the market once the business is up and running. Is this happening already? The answer is probably 'Yes and No'. 'Yes', in that many of these activities are being conducted although on a piecemeal, not planned and structured, basis. 'No', in that a market and customer oriented perspective is not typically the start point. A more normal approach is that organisations try to 'sell' their existing capabilities ('inside-out'), rather than understanding market needs and tailoring their product or service accordingly ('outside-in'). Also, the marketing and communications team is not generally included in institution's business development, despite the fact that they often can provide the necessary insights. What are the benefits of this approach? Firstly, diversifying income streams beyond the well understood core university activities of teaching students and winning research grants is still relatively new territory for many institutions; and it's clearly important to gain a good understanding of potential customers. After all, they are going to pay for your product and service in future. Second, it's valuable to know who else is already targeting the market, particularly if you're planning to launch something new. What services already exist, what are customers paying for and where are the gaps? Finally, it helps to have a longer-term perspective and consider how sustainable income can be built beyond the initial product or service. How might services need to adapt and grow in the future; how can a portfolio be built? All of this can be achieved without marketing expertise and resource but shouldn't it be an integral part of their role? It's certainly part of the rationale for having a strategic marketing as well as communications capability.

      "bodyText": "7pm Kauto Star update: Gold Cup hope's canter Kauto Star, who suffered a fall while schooling 12 days ago, continued his progress towards a vital racecourse gallop at Wincanton on Friday when he cantered with the World Hurdle favourite Big Buck's at Paul Nicholls's yard on Wednesday. \"Nothing major to report today but we are, thankfully, still heading in the right direction,\" Nicholls said in his column on the Betfair website on Wednesday afternoon. \"He once again had his physio and his hour on the walker. And then he had a half-speed 10-furlong canter with Big Buck's and then a canter up the hill with him, too. In fact, all my Cheltenham horses did the same routine, so Kauto did everything the other Festival horses did today.\" Kauto Star is top-priced at 4-1 to win his third Gold Cup at Cheltenham next Friday, while he could be backed at 5-1 to small stakes on Betfair on Wednesday evening. 1.40pm Spirit Son causes false flutter in Champion market Will Hayler: Another day, another false alarm in the ante-post Cheltenham betting markets. One punter decided to shake up betting on the Champion Hurdle this morning by staking several hundred pounds on Spirit Son, ruled out by Nicky Henderson three weeks ago and matched at 999-1 as a result. Consequently, Spirit Son's price tumbled quickly downwards and when betting was suspended for the latest entry stage at lunchtime, he had been matched at odds as low as 12-1 for the race. Could this mean he was about to be re-supplemented for the race? Well, no. He wasn't supplemented, he's not going to run and he remains lame and out for the season. Those sharpening their knives for Henderson (remember Binocular?) had to quickly put them back in the drawer. The incident offers a salutary lesson that, especially in these Twittering times, Chinese whispers frequently still prove just as wide of the mark as they have done in racing for hundreds of years. Wednesday's best bets, by Will Hayler I'm starting to warm to the prospects of a few of the Venetia Williams-trained runners in the handicaps at the Cheltenham Festival with the trainer hitting boiling point at just the right time. Compare the laboured performance of Pentiffic at Leicester five days earlier when I tipped him on this page (and backed him - boo!) to his gallant display from the front in Saturday's Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster (still clear when tipping over at the final fence) and you can see how having a recent run often appears to help bring her runners forwards. Rigadin de Beauchene (3.30) was making his first appearance for eight weeks when chasing home Mortimers Cross at Fontwell 10 days ago and despite being raised a harsh-looking 7lb by the handicapper for that effort, is able to line up back at the same track before that new rating has kicked in. Despite an unpromising set of form figures over jumps, Celtic Charlie (4.00) comes into his contest in good heart having won his last two on the all-weather and he has been found an interesting opportunity for his return to hurdling. He had no chance in better company but has been handed a lowly mark for this, his handicap debut. Near The Water (4.30) is a more speculative suggestion later on the card in a contest that features plenty of dead wood. Dropped to a mark of 95 after a mixed bag of efforts (mostly poor) this season, he can at least take opposition a great deal weaker than he has been used to meeting recently. Bought, like all of Trevor Hemmings' team of jumpers, with steeplechasing in mind, it could pay to take a chance on Brokethegate (3.50) on his first start over fences at Catterick. He made taking late progress when third at Wetherby in November and subsequent defeats have come in unsuitably soft ground. Today's quicker surface should prove more suitable. Like his brother, Maurice, Edmond Linehan has been impressing among the conditional jockey ranks this season and Flora's Pride's (4.20) prospects will be boosted considerably by his presence in the saddle. Cheltenham Festival stat of the day, by Paul Jones The JLT Specialty Handicap Chase over three miles that immediately precedes the Stan James Champion Hurdle has attracted an interesting mix of established chasers and novices as usual and it is worth noting that the heavily outnumbered novices have won three of the last eight runnings. The strong likelihood is that would have been four of the last eight had Bensalem safely negotiated the newly positioned penultimate fence as he was trading at odds-on in-running when exiting ago. Novices had a dreadful record in this handicap up until 2004 not winning any of the previous 26 renewals but, it has been all change since then and this year they have the likes of Our Mick, Lie Forrit, Mossley, Penny Max and Blenheim Brook amongst their entries with a good chance of making it into the line up. Paul Jones is author of the Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Guide Tipping competition, day three Kenty and fatdeano, who shared the lead yesterday, both found Clash Duff (7-1), the Devon National winner. But they share third because Lindsey6677 and nadhr79 both had Clash Duff and Black Cache (8-1), as did noodlearms. ToffeeDan1, sandiuk and TL127 were the only ones to find Cavite Eta (7-1). Lameduck deserves your sympathy, by the way, after three runner-ups yesterday. We are sending some better karma your way, sir. Meanwhile, ToffeeDan1's speed-tipping idea seems to work. Today, we'd like your tips, please, for these races: 3.50 Catterick, 4.20 Catterick, 4.30 Fontwell. This week's prize is two Club enclosure tickets to day one of the Cheltenham Festival, next Tuesday 13th March, kindly offered by OLBG, a sports betting community website, who are sponsoring a race at the Festival for the first time. You will have to be able to provide us with your postal address on Friday evening (in response to our email) and the tickets will be sent so as to arrive on Monday morning. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not joined in so far this week, you are welcome to do so today, but you will start on -9. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.

      "body": "<h2>7pm Kauto Star update: Gold Cup hope's canter</h2> <p>Kauto Star, who suffered a fall while schooling 12 days ago, continued his progress towards a vital racecourse gallop at Wincanton on Friday when he cantered with the World Hurdle favourite Big Buck's at Paul Nicholls's yard on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"Nothing major to report today but we are, thankfully, still heading in the right direction,\" Nicholls said in his column on the Betfair website on Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>\"He once again had his physio and his hour on the walker. And then he had a half-speed 10-furlong canter with Big Buck's and then a canter up the hill with him, too. In fact, all my Cheltenham horses did the same routine, so Kauto did everything the other Festival horses did today.\"</p> <p>Kauto Star is top-priced at 4-1 to win his third Gold Cup at Cheltenham next Friday, while he could be backed at 5-1 to small stakes on Betfair on Wednesday evening.</p> <h2>1.40pm Spirit Son causes false flutter in Champion market</h2> <p><strong>Will Hayler: </strong>Another day, another false alarm in the ante-post Cheltenham betting markets.</p> <p>One punter decided to shake up betting on the Champion Hurdle this morning by staking several hundred pounds on Spirit Son, ruled out by Nicky Henderson three weeks ago and matched at 999-1 as a result.</p> <p>Consequently, Spirit Son's price tumbled quickly downwards and when betting was suspended for the latest entry stage at lunchtime, he had been matched at odds as low as 12-1 for the race. Could this mean he was about to be re-supplemented for the race?</p> <p>Well, no. He wasn't supplemented, he's not going to run and he remains lame and out for the season. Those sharpening their knives for Henderson (remember Binocular?) had to quickly put them back in the drawer.</p> <p>The incident offers a salutary lesson that, especially in these Twittering times, Chinese whispers frequently still prove just as wide of the mark as they have done in racing for hundreds of years.</p> <h2>Wednesday's best bets, by Will Hayler</h2> <p>I'm starting to warm to the prospects of a few of the Venetia Williams-trained runners in the handicaps at the Cheltenham Festival with the trainer hitting boiling point at just the right time.</p> <p>Compare the laboured performance of Pentiffic at Leicester five days earlier when I tipped him on this page (and backed him - boo!) to his gallant display from the front in Saturday's Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster (still clear when tipping over at the final fence) and you can see how having a recent run often appears to help bring her runners forwards.</p> <p><strong>Rigadin de Beauchene (3.30)</strong> was making his first appearance for eight weeks when chasing home Mortimers Cross at Fontwell 10 days ago and despite being raised a harsh-looking 7lb by the handicapper for that effort, is able to line up back at the same track before that new rating has kicked in.</p> <p>Despite an unpromising set of form figures over jumps, <strong>Celtic Charlie (4.00)</strong> comes into his contest in good heart having won his last two on the all-weather and he has been found an interesting opportunity for his return to hurdling. He had no chance in better company but has been handed a lowly mark for this, his handicap debut.</p> <p><strong>Near The Water (4.30)</strong> is a more speculative suggestion later on the card in a contest that features plenty of dead wood. Dropped to a mark of 95 after a mixed bag of efforts (mostly poor) this season, he can at least take opposition a great deal weaker than he has been used to meeting recently.</p> <p>Bought, like all of Trevor Hemmings' team of jumpers, with steeplechasing in mind, it could pay to take a chance on <strong>Brokethegate (3.50) </strong>on his first start over fences at Catterick. He made taking late progress when third at Wetherby in November and subsequent defeats have come in unsuitably soft ground. Today's quicker surface should prove more suitable.</p> <p>Like his brother, Maurice, Edmond Linehan has been impressing among the conditional jockey ranks this season and <strong>Flora's Pride's (4.20</strong>) prospects will be boosted considerably by his presence in the saddle.</p> <h2>Cheltenham Festival stat of the day, by Paul Jones</h2> <p>The JLT Specialty Handicap Chase over three miles that immediately precedes the Stan James Champion Hurdle has attracted an interesting mix of established chasers and novices as usual and it is worth noting that the heavily outnumbered novices have won three of the last eight runnings. The strong likelihood is that would have been four of the last eight had Bensalem safely negotiated the newly positioned penultimate fence as he was trading at odds-on in-running when exiting ago. Novices had a dreadful record in this handicap up until 2004 not winning any of the previous 26 renewals but, it has been all change since then and this year they have the likes of Our Mick, Lie Forrit, Mossley, Penny Max and Blenheim Brook amongst their entries with a good chance of making it into the line up.</p> <p>Paul Jones is author of the <a href=\"http://www.weatherbysshop.co.uk/books/betting/cheltenham-festival-betting-guide-2012\" title=\"\">Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Guide</a></p> <h2>Tipping competition, day three</h2> <p>Kenty and fatdeano, who shared the lead yesterday, both found Clash Duff (7-1), the Devon National winner. But they share third because Lindsey6677 and nadhr79 both had Clash Duff and Black Cache (8-1), as did noodlearms. ToffeeDan1, sandiuk and TL127 were the only ones to find Cavite Eta (7-1).</p> <p>Lameduck deserves your sympathy, by the way, after three runner-ups yesterday. We are sending some better karma your way, sir.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ToffeeDan1's speed-tipping idea seems to work.</p> <p>Today, we'd like your tips, please, for these races: <strong>3.50 Catterick, 4.20 Catterick, 4.30 Fontwell</strong>.</p> <p>This week's prize is two Club enclosure tickets to day one of the Cheltenham Festival, next Tuesday 13th March, kindly offered by <a href=\"http://www.olbg.com/\" title=\"\">OLBG</a>, a sports betting community website, who are sponsoring a race at the Festival for the first time.

      "bodyText": "\"In retrospect, maybe I didn't think it through,\" said Jamie. He, Russ and I were sitting in the pub. In front of us on the table was a mousetrap. Jamie and Russ have been best friends for two decades, are two of the most polite men I know, share a birthday, and have a tradition of buying each other useful, unromantic presents, of which this was the latest. Three weeks ago, Russ's hamster, Baboushka, had escaped beneath his floorboards, and now, with only a fortnight to go before he moved house, he was losing hope of finding him. In theory, Jamie's gift, which described itself as a \"humane, alternative\" trap, was typically thoughtful and practical. It was only when you looked at it more closely \u2013 at the drawing on the back of its packaging, for example, depicting a mouse being hanged from what appeared to be a steel noose - that you began to wonder about how it might work out in the long term for Baboushka. \"No, no,\" protested Russ. \"It's great. It's just, I wonder if there's a way of catching him without severing his spine.\" \"What about Tom's cats? Couldn't you borrow one of them? I hear they're very gentle.\" I hadn't told Russ and Jamie about my cats' recent fall from grace as mousers, but I wasn't surprised that word had reached them. Norwich is a small city, gossip travels fast, and the recent transformation of Shipley (black, bit of a gobshite) and Ralph (tabby, great sideburns) from habitual vole chompers to a kind of reliable, family-run rodent bus service has been spectacular. I suppose I should be happy about this. For many years, I would complain bitterly about waking up to find large parts of my house resembling a mouseoleum. It's now been at least eight months since I emerged bleary-eyed from my bedroom in the middle of the night and stepped in a shrew's face, and my G Plan sideboard looks far better without the blood spatter. But it's not that my cats have stopped catching mice, just that they have lost all their urgency in savaging them, instead leaving them unharmed on carpets and beneath sofas with what appears to be a \"just in case\" mentality. Always careful to keep a complete one around for later, their approach to rodents has become a little like a Blue Peter presenter's approach to cardboard dioramas. I wouldn't quite have been confident in lending Ralph or Shipley to Russ, since there are still mishaps: a broken leg here, a little heart attack there. Mostly, though, I will manage to catch and free the victims before that, using a mug I got free from Richer Sounds and an All The President's Men DVD, while a reclining Ralph and Shipley casually raise an eyebrow each in the background. I do this so often now, I've begun to think of it as an unpaid evening job. I at least have a slight warning system when there's a rodent on the way, in the form of Ralph's special Mouse Meow. This will inevitably result in him emerging at the top of the stairs with a small animal placed horizontally across his face, in a kind of \"mousetache\" way, and is different to his normal meow, where he shouts \"RALLLLPH\". I did feel a bit smug about having a cat who could meow his own name, but then it occurred to me that perhaps he was just one of those irritating cats who are constantly referring to themselves in the third person. I also think if he was really clever he would have devised a specific meow for the time last week when he brought in a large slug on his back and gently dropped a stunned, perfectly intact moorhen in my study. In a way, these gifts are just another normal part of a special madness that grips Norfolk in the spring, and one which has arrived early this year: the same fever that made a stranger in Norwich bound up to me by the river last Saturday and ask me to take a photo of him and his freshly caught fish and an equally unknown bearded Buddhist gardener with \"Hardy Perennial\" written on his baseball cap invite himself into my garden the day before, advise me on compost, and tell me this would be \"my year\". I accept it, in a \"normal for Norfolk\" way, and rather like it. The slug on Ralph's back did make me a bit nauseous at first, but I found that I soon felt better about it when I imagined it was a small snake riding a horse. And while moorhen poo is a very adhesive substance, the good thing about being on my hands and knees cleaning it was that it gave me a revelatory new appreciation of all the times in the past when I hadn't been. I am slightly worried about just how many rodents an extended season of regrowth and rebirth will bring, though. I can't rely on the help of my eldest cat, The Bear, since he's never slaughtered anything, with exception of a chicken bhuna I once left unattended for too long. I'm not using a trap, since, while my conscience will allow me to flip a dead vole into some undergrowth, it will not permit me to deploy a contraption designed solely to kill one. That leaves the ginger intruder cat that likes to come in at night and steal my cats' biscuits. My problem there is that he never lets me near him, and I have no way of striking a deal where I enable him access to the better, live treats on the other floor of my house on the condition he stops pissing on my kitchen blackboard. Until I do, I'll put it on my list of top things to translate into Catspeak, along with \"Stop hurting me with your eyes\" and \"It's a carrot \u2013 you won't like it\" and just hope that, for Ralph and Shipley, there's no repeat of the Great Rat Influx of spring 2005. Richer Sounds mugs are big, but they're not that big. \u2022 Tom Cox's latest book, Talk To The Tail, is out now in paperback - buy it from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a35.59.

      "bodyText": "Six British soldiers are missing, believed killed, after an explosion hit an armoured vehicle in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence has said. The five soldiers from the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and one from the 1st Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment were on mounted patrol when their Warrior armoured fighting vehicle was struck on Tuesday in Helmand province. If they are dead it will take the number of British service personnel killed in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001 to more than 400 and intensify debate about the timetable for withdrawal of troops. Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Mackenzie, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said: \"I have the tragic duty to report that six soldiers are missing, believed killed, during a security patrol.\" Next of kin have been informed. David Cameron said the news was a \"desperately sad day for our country\". Speaking in Downing Street, the prime minister added: \"It is a reminder of the huge price that we are paying for the work we are doing in Afghanistan and the sacrifice that our troops have made and continue to make. \"I do believe it's important work for our national security right here at home but of course this work will increasingly be carried out by Afghan soldiers and we all want to see that transition take place. \"But today we should think of the families.\" The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, and chief of defence staff, General Sir David Richards, paid tribute to the soldiers and their efforts to help build up Afghan security forces as the UK prepares to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Hammond said the incident \"brings home to us the dangers that are faced on a daily basis by the men and women of our armed forces deployed in Afghanistan\". He added: \"I utterly condemn those responsible for this incident who will ultimately fail to derail a mission that is protecting our national security at home and making real progress in Helmand province.\" The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said: \"It is tragic news that six of our soldiers are missing, presumed dead, in Afghanistan. Our hearts go out to their families, friends and colleagues. \"This is a dark day. \"We salute all of our fallen and those who continue to serve in the face of the gravest danger. They are serving with bravery and courage and we owe them all a huge debt of gratitude.\" Richards said he was deeply saddened by the news. \"The courage, fortitude and determination of those servicemen and women currently in Helmand is inspirational,\" he said Warrior armoured fighting vehicles are designed to withstand explosions from mines, suggesting a large explosion. An improvised explosive device of such magnitude would probably have taken several men a number of hours to put it in place. A \u00a31bn upgrade of the Warriors was announced at the end of last year, designed to extend the service life of the vehicles to 2040 and beyond. If all six soldiers were killed the incident would represent the biggest single loss of UK life in a single incident in Afghanistan since 2006, when an ageing RAF Nimrod crashed in the country, shortly after mid-air refuelling, with the loss of all 14 people aboard. That was the most deadly incident involving British troops since the US-led invasion in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. If the soldiers are dead, it will take to 404 the number of British service personnel killed since the 2001 Nato-led invasion. It will make this year's death toll for British soldiers in Afghanistan 10. The latest incident comes as political pressure to bring the conflict to an end is mounting internationally. Downing Street said last month that British troops would end their lead combat role in Afghanistan by the end of next year. This will lead to Afghan security forces being in sole charge of combat operations against insurgents by the end of 2014, when most of Britain's 9,500-strong contingent will have returned home. Tuesday's events will renew concerns about the capability of the Afghan forces to cope as Nato troops withdraw. The government clarified the UK's withdrawal strategy after an announcement by the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, that the role of US forces would change from combat to training from the middle of next year.",

They have done everything we asked of them in a short space of time,\" said Jones, following his first return to the dugout since he was sacked by Cardiff at the end of last season. \"They were asked to get the ball down and they did that. I couldn't pick out one player from that performance because they all did so well.\" No doubt the bulk of the 17,684 crowd at Hillsborough would have departed in happy mood, but among the home support there will remain some bewilderment and disappointment over the decision of Wednesday's chairman, Milan Mandaric, to sack Gary Megson following their last match there \u2013 the 1-0 win over bitter rivals Sheffield United at the end of last month, particularly as Megson, a former Wednesday player and lifelong fan, had steered the club to third having replaced Alan Irvine 13 months ago. As such, it was perhaps no surprise Jones found time to give his backing to Mandaric. \"I'm really pleased for everyone, and in particular the chairman because he's had a little bit of flak in the last week,\" said the 55-year-old. \"It's nice to see him with a smile on his face as well.\" Wednesday remain third and saw their chances of automatic promotion improve following second-place Sheffield United's surprise 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened Walsall. Only a point separates the Steel City neighbours, although United have a game in hand. Meanwhile, the League One leaders, Charlton, were involved in the shock result of the evening, losing 2-0 to Colchester to record their first defeat at The Valley this season. Goals from Anthony Wordsworth and Steven Gillespie secured all three points for the visitors, but there is little reason for Chris Powell, the Charlton manager, to panic; his side remain 13 points clear at the summit. \u2022 Also making managerial starts at new clubs were Ronnie Moore at Tranmere and Richard O'Kelly at League Two Hereford, both of whom saw their sides claim a point in contrasting circumstances. There was relief for Moore, in his third spell at Prenton Park, as John Welsh scored a stoppage-time equaliser to cancel out Damion Stewart's fifth-minute opener for Notts County, while O'Kelly could only look on with a mix of rage and disbelief as Hereford threw away a 2-0 half-time lead, secured through a brace from Will Evans, to draw 2-2 with Macclesfield at Moss Rose. \u2022 In the Championship, West Ham could move into first place with a victory over Watford on Wednesday night after leaders Southampton drew 1-1 draw with Ipswich at St Mary's. The hosts, fresh from a 1-0 win at Elland Road on Saturday, took a deserved lead through their top-scorer Rickie Lambert on 74 minutes only to see Jason Scotland rescue a point for Paul Jewell's side five minutes from full-time. \"We are still in the race for the league, as we have been for a very long time,\" said the Southampton manager, Nigel Adkins. \"This won't knock confidence in the changing room, we are still on a great run and we have as good a chance as anybody of winning this league.\" True, but Saints will be aware that there is now a real danger of them slipping out of the automatic-promotion places altogether given Reading's surge up the table. Brian McDermott's side are third, one point behind West Ham and three behind Southampton, following their 1-0 win against Portsmouth, the club's seventh straight victory in the league. \u2022 Finally, some much-needed cheer for Port Vale as they beat Burton Albion 3-0 thanks to Marc Richard's opener and two goals from Louis Dodds. The win came only hours after the club announced their intention to enter administration on Friday following a winding-up order from HM Revenue and Customs over outstanding tax payments. Administration will lead to a 10-point deduction and Micky Adams's side falling from ninth to 14th in League Two. \u2022 Check out all the latest league tables in our stats centre",

Prisoners' Wives finished with 4.3 million viewers, a 17% share of the audience from 9pm. The BBC1 show was down from the 4.9 million (20.4%) who watched the first episode of its six-part run five weeks ago. ITV1's coverage of Chelsea's fifth-round 2-0 win over Birmingham, their first match since the departure of manager Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, averaged 3.5 million viewers, a 14.2% share between 7.30pm and 10pm. Live coverage of the match, which kicked off at 7.45pm, averaged 3.8 million. Both were beaten by Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, which had 5.2 million viewers (20.8%) between 9pm and 10pm across Channel 4, bouncing back from a ratings dip to 4.4 million last Tuesday against ITV1's Brit awards. Sky Sports 2 had the other big live football of the night, Arsenal's Uefa Champions League last 16 second leg match against Milan, in which they tried to overturn a 4-0 deficit from the first leg. The Gunners almost managed it, winning 3-0, delivering an average of 1.2 million viewers (5%) to Sky Sports 2 between 7pm and 10.15pm, with a five-minute peak of 2.4 million. Programme title of the day Channel 5's Nazi Titanic: Revealed, a documentary about a 1942 German propaganda film about the sinking of the famous ship, had 1.3 million viewers, a 5.4% share between 8pm and 9pm. It was beaten by Channel 4's Supersize v Superskinny, which had 2.5 million viewers (10.3%) between 8pm and 9pm, and the last of BBC2's Alex Polizzi: the Fixer, watched by 2 million viewers, 8.4% of the audience. Almost programme title of the day Horizon's Solar Storms \u2013 The Threat to Planet Earth, was watched by 1.9 million viewers, a 7.6% share, between 9pm and 10pm, including 105,000 viewers on BBC HD.

A group of Indian journalists, numbering maybe 100, were forced to lock themselves into a school after being attacked by 4,000-strong crowd. TV equipment, cameras and vehicles were damaged in the melee at the school, which was being used as an election centre, in the city of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh. The journalists sheltered in the school for several hours to protect themselves. They first witnessed violent clashes between supporters of the losing Samjavadi party candidate and the winning Bahujan Samaj party candidate. Then the crowd turned on the journalists. Vinod Gautam, who was working for national news channel NDTV, said: \"The police were completely outnumbered by the crowds. They did nothing to help us.\" The Delhi Union of Journalists criticised the administration's slow reaction, saying: \"It is deplorable that... no action was taken to free the journalists.\" Bob Dietz, the Asia programme coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: \"Political leaders bear responsibility for the lawless actions of their supporters, and police for their inability to enforce order.\" Source: CPJ",

      "bodyText": "There are more than a million people under 25 who are unemployed in the UK, according to the internationally agreed measure of unemployment. Graduates are leaving university and finding that the only jobs they can find are in supermarkets or cafes. It has been clear for some time that the recession of the past five years has had a disproportionate effect on the young, but a report by the Economic and Social Research Council shows just how tough life has become. When the economy was growing strongly before the slump, 50% of young people out of work in 2006 had found a job by 2007. Three years later, that percentage had almost halved; only 27% of those young and unemployed in 2009 were in work a year later. By contrast, employment rates for so-called prime-aged workers, those aged between 25 and 44, barely budged. The proportion of this group entering the workforce between 2009 and 2010 fell by just three percentage points compared to 2006-07, while labour participation of those aged over 44 actually rose. Young people were not just less likely to be taken on by an employer, they were also more prone to being laid off than older workers. The study raises some important issues, both social and economic. Previous research has shown that someone who is unemployed when they are young is more likely to be out of work in later life, and suffer a higher risk of low income and poverty as a result. This is what lies behind the talk of a \"lost generation\". What appears to have happened over the past five years is that employers have hoarded labour and put a higher premium on experience. They have been wary of hiring young people who by virtue of their inexperience are not as productive as a fully-trained older worker, and when times have been tough the axe has fallen on the new recruits. Tackling the problem of youth unemployment has, rightly, become an urgent priority for the government, although it is worth mentioning that one of the first things it did was to scrap Labour's Future Jobs Fund, a scheme that was having some success in getting young people into work. A number of possible remedies have been mooted. For those who believe that young people are pricing themselves out of the labour market, the solution is to make the minimum wage less generous. Given that the rate for 18 to 20-year-olds is less than a fiver an hour, and for 16 to 18-year-olds is \u00a33.68 an hour, it is hard to say that the minimum wage is unduly generous, particularly given rising transport costs for those travelling to work. Germany's highly advanced system of apprenticeships is also much admired by some UK politicians, and there is no doubt that the withering away of extensive on-the-job training has played a part in making the transition from education to work far more difficult for young people in Britain. Ultimately, though, the problem boils down to this. Demand for labour is weak, and cost-conscious employers are not inclined to hire young workers. Government policy should have three aims: an education system that prepares people for work, a macroeconomic policy that generates sufficient demand and a system of financial incentives to persuade employers to give school leavers and graduates a break.",

That petered out and wandered off to Newcastle to die. John Prescott battled for regional devolution in the Nineties but couldn't persuade Blair, the Great Centralist, to offer anything worth voting for. So the North East duly didn't. Since then centralisation has gone on apace. Now our government of millionaires gives us government of the North by the South East for the South East. It's dedicated to spending cuts which hit the North hardest because we're more dependent on public sector jobs and spending. It's abolished our Regional Development Agencies, and regional offices, put local government in financial chains. It's handed regional development to a scrabbling mass of Local Enterprise Partnerships competing for a smaller pot of money. Which makes it time to fight back. That fight begins with the inauguration this Friday, 9 March, of the Hannah Mitchell Foundation to commemorate the life of the great Lancashire campaigner and develop a new campaign for the neglected North. We need it because the North sits between two areas, both doing better than us and both getting more public spending. Scotland is energised and boosted by devolution. On the other side is the ever prosperous South East and the Great Wen, draining development, investment, and our young people away from the North. In 2014 Scotland will choose between Home Rule and Devo Max (or, as the Tories put it, Devo Plus). Each threatens us by eliminating or reducing Scottish representation at Westminster or stopping Scottish MPs voting on 'English' issues. This weakens a Labour Party which has always spoken (though all too quietly) for the North and the deprived regions. It increases the Parliamentary dominance of London and the South East. That's yet another reason for devolution to the North. We need it to give us the energising effects of the power to manage our own destinies and decide our own priorities. We need to end the servitude of carrying begging bowls up and down to London. The North needs such a campaign. Equally clearly we have to decide whether to fight for the old, rejected, regions of Yorkshire and Humberside, the North West, and the North East, or whether we recognise that unity is strength and fight for the whole North as the unit of devolved government, with similar powers to Scotland. Hannah's agenda must be first to decide that, then to begin the campaign. But only for the North. Those further south can decide for themselves whether they want a 'big region' strategy, a variable geometry of devolution or staying as they are: the fats of the land. I don't care. The first, and for me only, priority is the North. The Hannah Mitchell Foundation, previously flagged in the Guardian Northerner will be launched on Friday at Bradford City Hall. Pre-booking essential via this link or phone 07795 008691, with over 100 already signed up.

      "bodyText": "The death of the 400th Briton killed serving in Afghanistan is another grim statistic in a conflict that has been going on so long it would hardly be surprising if people became inured to the toll. It offers another chance to pause and reflect, and to ask whether another milestone tells us anything significant about what has happened and is still happening in Afghanistan. Context is important. Though UK forces have been in the country since 2001, only five British troops died in the first five years of combat. The numbers started rising fast in 2006, when 3,300 personnel from 16 Air Assault Brigade were sent to Helmand province amid fears the Taliban had reclaimed territory in the south of the country. Explaining the decision to triple troop numbers, John Reid, then defence secretary, said the UK could \"not risk Afghanistan once again becoming a sanctuary for terrorists\". However you characterise the Taliban, the British contingent quickly discovered they had arrived much too late, and with too few people. At times, they were in danger of being overrun. In 2006, 39 British troops died, the following year 42. In the following three years, the figures rose sharply \u2013 51, 108, 103. In 2011, the figure dropped to 46. The curve on the graph tells you something about the fierceness of the fighting in 2009 and 2010. It does not explain how western governments so completely underestimated what needed to be done to impose some kind of stability and security in Afghanistan's contested heartlands. The drop in casualties last year came after the US \"surged\" 30,000 extra combat troops into the country, spearheading a campaign to take on the Taliban in its strongholds. So the 400th death comes at a time when casualty rates are falling. But British fatalities have to be put in a Nato context, and a civilian one too. In 2011, 418 American troops died in Afghanistan. In 2010, 499 were killed. On 1 January this year, a total of 1,864 US personnel had died in the conflict, much the highest of any nation in the military coalition. Twenty-eight nations have lost troops in Afghanistan, but Canada \u2013 which has lost 158 \u2013 is the only other country to have suffered more than 100 casualties. None of which compares to the number of Afghan civilians estimated to have died since 2006. The United Nations believes almost 10,000 died as a result of the conflict in the four years to 2010. Within three years, only a few hundred British personnel will remain in Afghanistan. The withdrawal has already begun and, if trends continue, the number of British casualties is likely to fall as hundreds of troops head back to the UK this year, with thousands more to follow in 2013 and 2014. Sometimes it is easy to look at the conflict through the prism of statistics, but 400 is not just a number. It is a person who will have a name, an age, and a rank. Their death will mean another family coping with the loss of a loved one; friends and colleagues with the pain of being told someone they cared for won't be coming home. The military will put a protective arm around those who are suffering; liaison officers will take families through the arrangements, commanders of regiments will write eulogies and, where possible, read lessons at funerals. Wives of other troops will form a tightly knit circle around women who have lost a husband or partner. These formal and informal practices will carry on out of the spotlight, and bring comfort to relatives who will have good reason to question why British troops are still out there, and the price of the sacrifice they have made.",

That probably reflects the effect of the US \"surge\" of troops into the province in 2010, which pushed the Taliban onto the back foot and forced them to rely ever more on the deadly weapons. \"It's a great device to use against a conventional force,\" said Doug Czarnecki, deputy commander of Task Force Paladin, which counters the IED threat. \"The insurgent can't fight that with conventional which means they have got to find something to attack.\" Insurgents have been able to get hold of fertiliser without difficulty, turn it into bombs and move across the very porous border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The US is trying to find ways to alter chemical fertilisers made in Pakistan so they are harder to turn into explosives. In Helmand, where most British troops are based, a higher than average number of IEDs are detonated by the weight of the victim who unwittingly stands on them. Not only has there been a remorseless rise in the number of devices pouring out of backroom bomb factories, the insurgents have become ever more adept at making them more lethal. \"When we come up with measures to defeat their tactics, they change them,\" said Czarnecki. \"When we introduce new counter-measures they change again.\" When extra armour was added to vehicles the insurgents responded with bigger bombs. Then, when radio jamming equipment was introduced to foil remote control detonation, the rebels increased their use of command wires. But the development that makes the bombs so difficult to counteract is the emergence of IEDs containing only tiny quantities of metal. They now tend to have no metal shrapnel, relying instead on damage caused by rocks surrounding the explosive hurtling into the body of the person who sets off the bomb. Metal triggers have also been abandoned. That means traditional metal detectors used to find buried bombs are largely useless. Troops have responded with what officials call \"better tactics and training\". British troops arriving in Helmand will spend at least two weeks training at Camp Bastion before being sent out to the forward operating bases (FoBs). At Bastion there is a purpose-built training area that should help them identify in different types of terrain whether an IED has been planted . It will be drilled into them that little things really count \u2013 telltale clues of where to look, and what to look out for. Better still, the troops will be told they need to build relationships with villagers, who may know where IEDs are hidden. In recent months, within the three districts where the British are operating, commanders have come to rely upon this type of intelligence. If the villagers aren't talking to you, watch which routes they are using \u2013 and which ones they are avoiding too. The constant need for vigilance makes the work of patrolling the villages of southern Afghanistan incredibly arduous, but it seems to be paying off. Despite the increasing number of IEDs, the number of casualties caused by the bombs in the military region that includes Helmand declined by 20% between 2010 and 2011, officials said. Another factor has been the speed and quality of treatment given to troops wounded in IED blasts. The medical emergency response teams that fly from Camp Bastion have saved countless lives, not least because they take consultants out with them in adapted Chinook helicopters. Specialist treatment begins as soon as the helicopter lands, not when the patient gets back to the operating theatre. Many British troops badly injured in Afghanistan choose to have amputations even when their limbs can be saved, because recovery can be quicker and less painful. Some soldiers who have lost their legs can be running within six weeks, while those with supposedly less severe wounds can need multiple operations over months before any improvement. An estimated 300 troops have had amputations in the past decade, and 3,000 more need help with serious long-term injuries.",

      "bodyText": "A taxi driver in the Philippines can now refit his motorcycle, or \"tricycle\", with a cleaner engine, saving him money on fuel and reducing air pollution. A waste-picker in Bangladesh now has regular pay and health coverage for sorting organic waste in a clean factory, rather than toiling on a filthy dump, and that waste will be converted into natural fertiliser, which will generate greater yields for farmers. The same technology will turn waste into biogas, improving a slum dweller's access to cheaper electricity. And a social entrepreneur will be able to list his business on a new, Singapore-based regional trading platform designed to raise capital to benefit the communities the enterprise is trying to help. These are just a few of the dozens of ventures presented at the recent Asian Development Bank's (ADB) Philippine Social Enterprise Forum amid an explosion in Asian social enterprises set up to tackle the region's social and environmental problems. Bart \u00c9des, the ADB official who organised the forum, says: \"Social enterprises are building sustainable business models to address poverty, joblessness and a lack of reliable access to basic services like education, energy, health and water. Entrepreneurs have poured into this space, applying their skills to the mission of creating a better world. \"At the same time, many NGOs are reducing their dependence on grants by incorporating market-based approaches into their operations in ways that go well beyond the traditional high street Oxfam shop.\" Tommy Hutchinson, founder of i-genius, an international community of social entrepreneurs, says the growth of social enterprise in recent years is due to governments and corporations realising the potential of community-based efforts, consumers making more ethical decisions about what they buy, and people wanting more freedom and creativity from their work. Hutchinson says Asian countries have fuelled this growth in different ways. \"China is advanced in technology, Thailand has the government that is most switched on, and Indonesia has a strong, rural-based social business,\" he says. But the Philippines is in a particularly strong position, not just because the prevalence of so many social and environmental problems makes it the perfect laboratory to test ideas, but because of its people. Hutchinson says: \"They know how to make things and are producing real, social-based products which can be sold to earn income, and this is a sign of a healthy foundation. There is a lot of entrepreneurial talent, a lot of knowledge and awareness. And there is a strong sense of community.\" Jaime Aristotle Alip, chairman and managing director of Card, a microfinance institution in the Philippines, believes tax breaks and income disturbance insurance \u2013 designed to protect social entrepreneurs from income loss due to natural disasters \u2013 are also vital (south-east Asia is one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world). It took Iftekhar Enayetulah, co-founder of Waste Concern, 18 years to develop his project to the point where it is now being replicated in other Asian countries. But developing new technology to convert agricultural waste into energy (biogas) and resources (organic fertilisers) without emitting greenhouse gases has done more than just provide a safe livelihood for the poorest in Bangladesh. Enayetulah says: \"Waste management is a huge problem in Asia and the Pacific. We generate 3m tonnes per day and 60% of it is organic. We usually look at waste as a problem, but if you look at it as a resource, you can convert it into products that have a market value and it can be a more sustainable business.\" Meanwhile, projects such as Clean Engines, which supplies kits to convert dirty engines, have taken a more \"person by person\" approach, selling a product that allows individuals to help themselves while improving air quality by reducing emissions. Motorcycle owners buy the kits to become more fuel-efficient. They receive loans from micro-finance institutions to pay for them, and mechanics in the community are paid to install them. Greg Herman, the Clean Engines CEO, says: \"The Philippines is the kind of place where you can make a business like this work. There is an opportunity for raising the economic level of people at the base of the pyramid, and the government seems open to it because they know that the traditional approaches have not worked. They have a transportation crisis here. There can be very expensive solutions to the problem or incremental solutions.\" Former investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, the founder of Impact Investment Exchange Asia and Impact Investment Shujog, assists social enterprises to raise capital and in doing so develops \"social capital markets\" for them to engage with investors through debt or equity financing. Shahnaz says: \"Imagine a marketplace where you are coming to show your goods and buyers are coming to buy them. Social enterprises can say, 'we are doing XYZ. This is the social and environmental impact we are having, this is the financial return you are going to get \u2013 please invest.' And on the other side, we are bringing in investors ranging from high net-worth individuals to venture funds, who don't have the ability to find all these organisations or get them ready for investment.\" She plans to work with mid-level organisations that have already received some investment and are ready to go to the next level, and with those that need help to get to that stage. Shahnaz, who is from Bangladesh, says she believes Asia is the Silicon Valley of social enterprise. \"We have the capital, the enterprises and, best of all, we have the innovation. I think it's our time \u2013 it's Asia's time.\"",

The switch of races attracted the ire of ante-post punters, with McCain having been apparently adamant only days ago that the Arkle Chase remained the intended target for last year's Champion Hurdle runner-up. \"At the end of the day, we've got to do what we feel is in the best interests of the horse and my owner,\" McCain told the Guardian's Cheltenham Festival podcast. \"I had a good talk with him, Jason [Maguire] and so on and we just decided for the horse and for his future, [given] where he's at at the moment after his Kempton run, that this is the best way forwards. \"It's not really a case of him not pleasing. His work's good, it's always good. It's just I felt I'd have been more comfortable if I'd been able to school him more to sharpen him up having made that mistake at Kempton and because of the issues that we had after Kempton I haven't been able to school him as hard as I want. \"The horse comes first, pure and simple. It didn't take an awful lot of working out in the end. It's not to do with competition, that's irrelevant. He's a belting good horse and we've never been scared of taking a horse on. But we're hoping to have him for a number of years, not just one day next week, and we've got to look after him.\" McCain issued positive updates about the remainder of his Festival team, including Gold Cup hope Weird Al who has not been seen since finishing behind Kauto Star and Long Run in Haydock's Betfair Chase. \"Everything's gone smoothly with Weird Al,\" McCain said. \"We thought the best thing was to go straight to Cheltenham and touch wood it's gone swimmingly. He's a quality horse with a high cruising speed. He jumps and he stays. There's some good horses in there, but he'll run a big race.\"",

It didn't take an awful lot of working out in the end. It's not to do with competition, that's irrelevant. He's a belting good horse and we've never been scared of taking a horse on. But we're hoping to have him for a number of years, not just one day next week, and we've got to look after him.\"</p> <p>McCain issued positive updates about the remainder of his Festival team, including Gold Cup hope Weird Al who has not been seen since finishing behind Kauto Star and Long Run in Haydock's Betfair Chase.</p> <p>\"Everything's gone smoothly with Weird Al,\" McCain said. \"We thought the best thing was to go straight to Cheltenham and touch wood it's gone swimmingly. He's a quality horse with a high cruising speed. He jumps and he stays. There's some good horses in there, but he'll run a big race.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Both Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone have publicly embraced London's kaleidoscopic social character. Livingstone's commitment goes back nearly 20 years before the mayoralty was created, when as leader of the Greater London Authority it took the form of backing anti-racist and gay rights campaigns. As mayor, he introduced a civil partnerships register to the capital. Johnson, despite previously expressing assimilationist views on culture, was at pains in 2008 to enthuse about London's cosmopolitanism, which served as a rebuttal of (unfair) allegations of racism. The two men are sometimes depicted as polar opposites \u2013 Livingstone as a multiculturalist, Johnson as a traditionalist \u2013 but this is an oversimplification. Both are social liberals whose mayoral teams have been as mixed as the city itself in terms of sex, sexuality and ethnicity. Johnson has continued Livingstone's innovation of making Trafalgar Square's fourth plinth available for modern art projects. Both have supported events that showcase particular strands in the weave of London life. St Patrick's Day, St George's Day, Pride, Black History, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Latin American festivals to name but some. Of course, there have been differences, too. Johnson has spent less public money, encouraged organisers to seek more private sponsorship and favoured events that he believes attract tourist money into London's economy \u2013 his USA Day was a good example of the latter. Livingstone, by contrast, was strongly associated with large London events and was attacked for his union-backed, anti-racist Rise music festival, which Johnson did away with. Johnson has also made his mark in a big way with a sculpture in the Olympic Park and a smaller one with schemes to encourage children to play musical instruments. His adventurous Story of London festival started big but shrank. Such cultural programmes are in part an expression of the mayor's approach to London's community relations. The politics of these can be complex, contradictory and incendiary. Johnson's past attitude to gay marriage and recently to the London Irish have been criticised, while some older and disabled people are missing bendy buses. Livingstone has earned the enduring enmity of some for his ill-tempered encounter with a Jewish reporter from the Evening Standard while leaving a function celebrating gay equality in 2005. His public embrace of the Muslim cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi the previous year has had a similar effect. The gay activist and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell was among the critics of that episode, yet he has recently praised Livingstone's record on gay rights as \"exceptionally good\". Johnson has been rebuked for visiting a church in Barnet where gay \"exorcisms\" had been conducted. Both Johnson and Livingstone have been accused of exploiting racial or cultural anxieties to gain support from different sections of London's electorate. Our model mayor would not have enormous powers or resources to bring to bear on London's cultural life and community relations, but he or she would clearly have considerable influence and responsibilities. Should London's mayors restrict themselves to rather bland expressions of approval for \"vibrant diversity\" or be more pro-active? If the latter, what should the principles and objectives be? There is a danger of concentrating only on the ethnic and cultural dimensions of London's multicultured reality while neglecting others such as its wealth inequalities and the often differing concerns of inner and outer Londoners. I like the idea of a mayor fostering overlap and deeper understanding between different groups of Londoners, whose views on some issues may be at odds. Yet that type of blending already happens in everyday London life, in places of work, on school governing boards and in all sorts of community campaigns. What, then, could or should a mayor attempt to add? Is it possible or even desirable to promote a common London identity? Could, say, an equalities policy that combines asserting particular values with recognising disadvantage in all its forms give focus to a constructive debate? If so, what should those values be? Might a mayor commission a popular London history project that tries to map the ever-changing social, economic and cultural influences on the city over time, giving due weight to all and going right back to the Roman trading roots of Londinium? Any ideas? I'm all ears. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree ExHomelessGuy suggests: A closer look at London society will show you that although across the board the city is polyethnic, actual integration has a downward trajectory - with more and more distance forming between the jewish communities in Golders Green and West Hampstead, the asian communities is East London, the black carribean communities in South london, the burgeoning black african communities across the capital.. and of course the almost exclusively white yuppie classes who live pretty much everywhere there is property for their affluent parents to purchase on their behalf. Far from celebrating the cosmetic diversity of London society we should be asking the question of why interaction between these communities is less than ever before. DaveHill responds: I think your comment tells part of the story but there are other parts where the opposite applies. I also think your comment goes to the heart of the issue, which is about whether a London mayor should encourage further overlap between different groups and if so how, or whether mayors should stay out of such things. Where do you stand on that? SuperClive suggests: Keep using Trafalgar Square for the big parties. The more, the better. .But all boroughs should also have to have at least three big cultural events each year, in different locations. (If that results in 14 St George's Day bashes, so be it.) (Obviously this assumes a mayor has power over the boroughs that he/she doesn't have...) DaveHill responds: Hello Super! You're right, of course, that the mayor cannot tell boroughs what to do - well, not all that much - but is there a role for the mayor to try to draw them together with a common agenda what would enhance community relations in London through cultural events, as well as putting on his/her own festivals? And I love your oral history idea. I imagine a lot of borough libraries have archives of local projects of that kind that could be drawn on. MakeMPsOwnUp suggests: Isn't that the historical situation. Different ethnic groups would arrive in London to live in a specific area, living close-by those of their own heritage. Brick Lane has served as one of those clearing houses since at least the mid-19th century; Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution in Tsarist Russia, later immigrants from the Indian sub-continent or Afro-Caribbeans in the 1960s/1970s, more recently an Islamic \"ethnicity\" is apparent. As each group flourished and became prosperous they moved out en bloc to other areas, such as Golders Green, to be replaced by the next immigrant group. The question is whether this grouping is disadvantageous to London or does the (lifestyle) culture of each group reflect London's older history as a city of villages. Personally I do not see London as homogeneous. Even as I write this comment I see differences between two locales (I happen to be sat in a Starbucks on the boundary between Fitzrovia and Bloomsbury). Each has a distinct albeit overlapping character to it. The further east in Bloomsbury I go the less affluent the area becomes; the further west I go in Fitzrovia the more commercial it becomes. These differences reflect (positively, in my opinion) the nature, culture and community of the peoples who live and work there. That some areas like Fitzrovia and Bloomsbury are multi-ethnic and others, say Brixton, are predominantly uni-ethnic is irrelevant. A mayorial policy should respect and encourage this diversity. It should also facilitate discussion, understanding and tolerance of the ethnic, or socio-politico-linguistic groups that occupy those areas no matter how transitory that be, irrespective of which group next moves into Brick Lane. The policy should be for the enrichment of all not promote one lifestyle over against another. DaveHill responds: I am going to write this comment down in big letters and stick it on my wall. jessthecrip suggests: I certainly felt glad Ken was Mayor at the time of the London bombings. I think his London United response to those atrocities helped hold us together as a city at a time when we could potentially have been quite badly divided. Schools are good places to focus the message of connection and communication between different groups. In areas where schools are not multi-ethnic I'd want to see a Mayor encourage different schools to meet together, perhaps to 'twin' activities in some way. It's important for young people to see that in most ways their peers from different communities are exactly like them. The earlier bridges are built the better. DaveHill responds: I agree with you that Ken rose to the occasion over the London bombings although I also believe he needs to develop and improve his community and culture position. Some important battles have been won in terms of making arguments against discrimination and he's contributed a great deal. However, whilst those wins must still be protected, I think there's a need to build on what's been gained. This would include making sure that all those who feel left on the margins of London life are his priority. Maybe our Model Mayor can show him and the other candidates the way... On schools, the mayor has no formal powers over education but he/she can certainly broker meetings and encourage good ideas. Good thought, thanks. dktd suggests: My concern is independent culture. Independent culture ventures have been priced out of the centre of London. The London Astroia and the LA2 have been destroyed in place of a big tube state. There wern't independent, but they were the last mid-sized venues in London. There are no venues in the centre of London; the galleries are only for the established. One has to go to East London, and, on a rare occasion, Camden to find anything to go to. Occasionally elsewhere. There is a very limited amont of unofficial culture in the city centre. By this, I mean everything, not just what the media represents as youth culture. It is a city centre for people who like galleries and musicals. Nothing wrong with that, it's just a lie if you think it represents what's interesting in the here and now. People have been priced out of so many areas, as have independent pubs, clubs and other such things. You have to have a sponsor, nothing is done off the backs of the willing; only those who have connections and money. The Lib Dem law to make venues under 200 people or so, be able to host gigs again is a positive move, but we need more. London is a diverse city, but its center is not - it is endless monoliths of official culture. Solutions? For every so many chain, there needs to be a smattering of independence. Say, for every 500 clothes stores, there should be a multipurpose venue (an independent pub with a backroom?). For every major brand larger, there should be local breweries (Camden and Meantime provide some of the best beer/larger in the UK at the moment - why aren't they EVERYWHERE in London?) Breaks for those that put on unsupported, independent shows (art, music, whatever). Rent limits on shops and property. Insure the independence of venues.

My first thought is that delivering what you ask for would (as you appreciate, I think) involve things like planning regulations and interrupting large scale economic trends that have a life of their own. Not easy. But I will put my mind to it and hopefully others will too. Certainly, when I moved to London in 1979 there was a lot of \"unofficial\" culture around that I derived a great deal of pleasure and enlightenment from. Don't ask for details... philipphilip99 suggests: To suggest the Mayor of London can have any influence on community, culture and identity is laughable. London is an organic thing and depends ultimately on its population displaying enough (perhaps just enough) co-operation to keep the city grinding forwards. DaveHill responds: I think you overstate your case, but I certainly agree that there are limits and that attempting to do too much - and doing it badly - is not a good idea. I'm trying to pin down what the right amount is and what the right things are. And I'm finding this thread very helpful. AnUncivilServant suggests: I think the key thing is to make the cultural offer across London inclusive and accessible. We also need to recognise the economic value of the creative and cultural industries (second only to professional services) as one of the most productive areas of London's economy. From my perspective this means that cultural activities are not just a 'nice to have' but essential to London's status as a world city. It would be great to see more big brash things like the Red Bull Air Race bought to London alongside the less spectacular but equally fun events like the Rise festival. I think the mayor has it within their gift to ensure that Londoners (particularly younger Londoners) have the opportunity to experience lots of different cultures and culture. We are extraordinarily lucky to have free museums in this country but I think I'd like to see an official 'Londoner' card for all London tax payers to access discounts on things like theatre and exhibition tickets. I'd like to see the Mayor lobby for more private investment in cultural and entertainment activities as well. This shouldn't replace public sector funding (as Boris and his crony Veronica Wadley would like) but should be in addition to. it would be good to sweat the city and Canary Wharf for a contribution to something other than a few bicycles. I'll pick this up in more detail as and when Dave runs something on parks, public realm and green spaces but London's parks, gardens and public spaces offer a huge potential to ensure that culture isn't just confined to the South Bank. DaveHill responds: Leaving aside arguments about the precise branding and message of the Rise event, it does seems to me that the lack of an annual festival reflecting London's extraordinary range and history of popular music is just mad. Surely the money could be found for such an event. Agree that private sector could do more and do it well. Please develop your ideas on this thread if you want to - we're not everso strict. The other subjects you mention will be addressed to some extent next week under environment and/or planning, but there's a lot to squeeze in so do it now if that suits. And thanks.",

Livingstone's commitment goes back nearly 20 years before the mayoralty was created, when as leader of the Greater London Authority it took the form of backing <a href=\"http://www.casbah.ac.uk/surveys/archivereportLMA.stm\" title=\"\">anti-racist</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_home/history_of_lesbian_gay_and_bisexual_equality/default.asp#1980-1989\" title=\"\">gay rights</a> campaigns. As mayor, he introduced a <a href=\"http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/communityandliving/registrar/civil/percyandroger/\" title=\"\">civil partnerships register</a> to the capital. Johnson, despite previously expressing <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3634306/Reids-as-hard-as-jelly-or-hed-challenge-Brown-to-a-scrap.html\" title=\"\">assimilationist views</a> on culture, was at pains in 2008 to enthuse about London's cosmopolitanism, which served as a rebuttal of (unfair) allegations of racism.</p> <p>The two men are sometimes depicted as polar opposites \u2013 Livingstone as a multiculturalist, Johnson as a traditionalist \u2013 but this is an oversimplification. Both are social liberals whose mayoral teams have been as mixed as the city itself in terms of sex, sexuality and ethnicity. Johnson has continued Livingstone's innovation of making Trafalgar Square's fourth plinth available for modern art projects. Both have supported events that showcase particular strands in the weave of London life. <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/stpatricks\" title=\"\">St Patrick's Day</a>, <a href=\"http://www.boriswatch.co.uk/2009/04/27/st-georges-day-part-iii/\" title=\"\">St George's Day</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/07/03/breaking-boris-johnson-kicks-off-gay-pride-with-call-for-gay-marriage/\" title=\"\">Pride</a>, Black History, <a href=\"http://legacy.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=8772\" title=\"\">Jewish</a>, <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/eid-celebrations-come-trafalgar-square\" title=\"\">Muslim</a>, <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/diwali-festival-lights-trafalgar-square\" title=\"\">Hindu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/mayor-welcomes-carnaval-del-pueblo\" title=\"\">Latin American</a> festivals to name but some.</p> <p>Of course, there have been differences, too. Johnson has spent less public money, encouraged organisers to seek more private sponsorship and favoured events that he believes attract tourist money into London's economy \u2013 his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/17/boris-johnson-slashes-events-funding\" title=\"\">USA Day</a> was a good example of the latter. Livingstone, by contrast, was strongly associated with large London events and was attacked for his union-backed, anti-racist Rise music festival, which Johnson did away with. Johnson has also made his mark in a big way with a sculpture in the Olympic Park and a smaller one with schemes to encourage children to play musical instruments. His adventurous <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/art-culture/storyoflondon\" title=\"\">Story of London festival</a> started big but shrank.</p> <p>Such cultural programmes are in part an expression of the mayor's approach to London's community relations. The politics of these can be complex, contradictory and incendiary. Johnson's past attitude to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1032330/Boris-dons-pink-stetson-join-Gay-Pride-march.html\" title=\"\">gay marriage</a> and recently to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/feb/13/boris-london-stpatricks-day-celebrations\" title=\"\">London Irish</a> have been criticised, while some older and disabled people are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/11/bendy-buses-london-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">missing bendy buses</a>.</p> <p>Livingstone has earned the enduring enmity of some for his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2006/feb/25/localgovernment.politicsandthemedia\" title=\"\">ill-tempered encounter</a> with a Jewish reporter from the Evening Standard while leaving a function celebrating gay equality in 2005. His <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3888419.stm\" title=\"\">public embrace</a> of the Muslim cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi the previous year has had <a href=\"http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory/4973/9/03/2011/ken-livingstone-defends-muslim-hate-cleric-qaradawi.aspx\" title=\"\">a similar effect</a>. The gay activist and human rights campaigner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/07/kenapologisessortof\" title=\"\">Peter Tatchell was among the critics of that episode</a>, yet he has recently praised Livingstone's record on gay rights as \"<a href=\"http://www.petertatchell.net/politics/ken-livingstone-is-not-homophobic.htm\" title=\"\">exceptionally good</a>\". Johnson has been rebuked for visiting a church in Barnet where <a href=\"http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/10788\" title=\"\">gay \"exorcisms\" had been conducted</a>.</p> <p>Both Johnson and Livingstone have been accused of exploiting racial or cultural anxieties to gain support from different sections of London's electorate. Our model mayor would not have enormous powers or resources to bring to bear on London's cultural life and community relations, but he or she would clearly have considerable influence and responsibilities.</p> <p>Should London's mayors restrict themselves to rather bland expressions of approval for \"vibrant diversity\" or be more pro-active? If the latter, what should the principles and objectives be? There is a danger of concentrating only on the ethnic and cultural dimensions of London's multicultured reality while neglecting others such as its wealth inequalities and the often differing concerns of inner and outer Londoners.</p> <p>I like the idea of a mayor fostering overlap and deeper understanding between different groups of Londoners, whose views on some issues may be at odds. Yet that type of blending already happens in everyday London life, in places of work, on school governing boards and in all sorts of community campaigns.</p> <p>What, then, could or should a mayor attempt to add? Is it possible or even desirable to promote a common London identity? Could, say, an equalities policy that combines asserting particular values with recognising disadvantage in all its forms give focus to a constructive debate? If so, what should those values be? Might a mayor commission a popular London history project that tries to map the ever-changing social, economic and cultural influences on the city over time, giving due weight to all and <a href=\"http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/history-of-london/the-port-of-Londinium.html\" title=\"\">going right back to the Roman trading roots of Londinium</a>?</p> <p>Any ideas?

You're right, of course, that the mayor cannot tell boroughs what to do - well, not all that much - but is there a role for the mayor to try to draw them together with a common agenda what would enhance community relations in London through cultural events, as well as putting on his/her own festivals? And I love your oral history idea. I imagine a lot of borough libraries have archives of local projects of that kind that could be drawn on.</p> <h2><strong>MakeMPsOwnUp suggests:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387020498\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331122009975/makempsownup1-001.jpg\" alt=\"makempsownup1\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">makempsownup1 Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Isn't that the historical situation. Different ethnic groups would arrive in London to live in a specific area, living close-by those of their own heritage. Brick Lane has served as one of those clearing houses since at least the mid-19th century; Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution in Tsarist Russia, later immigrants from the Indian sub-continent or Afro-Caribbeans in the 1960s/1970s, more recently an Islamic \"ethnicity\" is apparent. As each group flourished and became prosperous they moved out en bloc to other areas, such as Golders Green, to be replaced by the next immigrant group.<br>The question is whether this grouping is disadvantageous to London or does the (lifestyle) culture of each group reflect London's older history as a city of villages. Personally I do not see London as homogeneous. Even as I write this comment I see differences between two locales (I happen to be sat in a Starbucks on the boundary between Fitzrovia and Bloomsbury). Each has a distinct albeit overlapping character to it. The further east in Bloomsbury I go the less affluent the area becomes; the further west I go in Fitzrovia the more commercial it becomes. These differences reflect (positively, in my opinion) the nature, culture and community of the peoples who live and work there. That some areas like Fitzrovia and Bloomsbury are multi-ethnic and others, say Brixton, are predominantly uni-ethnic is irrelevant.<br>A mayorial policy should respect and encourage this diversity. It should also facilitate discussion, understanding and tolerance of the ethnic, or socio-politico-linguistic groups that occupy those areas no matter how transitory that be, irrespective of which group next moves into Brick Lane. The policy should be for the enrichment of all not promote one lifestyle over against another.</p> <h2><strong>DaveHill responds:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387020499\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330948599867/DaveHill-001.jpg\" alt=\"DaveHill\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DaveHill Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am going to write this comment down in big letters and stick it on my wall.</p> <h2><strong>jessthecrip suggests:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387020500\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331121842819/jessthecrip1-001.jpg\" alt=\"jessthecrip1\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">jessthecrip1 Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I certainly felt glad Ken was Mayor at the time of the London bombings. I think his London United response to those atrocities helped hold us together as a city at a time when we could potentially have been quite badly divided.<br>Schools are good places to focus the message of connection and communication between different groups. In areas where schools are not multi-ethnic I'd want to see a Mayor encourage different schools to meet together, perhaps to 'twin' activities in some way. It's important for young people to see that in most ways their peers from different communities are exactly like them. The earlier bridges are built the better.</p> <h2><strong>DaveHill responds:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387020501\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330948599867/DaveHill-001.jpg\" alt=\"DaveHill\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DaveHill Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I agree with you that Ken rose to the occasion over the London bombings although I also believe he needs to develop and improve his community and culture position. Some important battles have been won in terms of making arguments against discrimination and he's contributed a great deal. However, whilst those wins must still be protected, I think there's a need to build on what's been gained. This would include making sure that all those who feel left on the margins of London life are his priority. Maybe our Model Mayor can show him and the other candidates the way...<br>On schools, the mayor has no formal powers over education but he/she can certainly broker meetings and encourage good ideas. Good thought, thanks.</p> <h2><strong>dktd suggests:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387020502\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330949856201/greyavatar-001.jpg\" alt=\"greyavatar\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">greyavatar Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My concern is independent culture.<br>Independent culture ventures have been priced out of the centre of London. The London Astroia and the LA2 have been destroyed in place of a big tube state. There wern't independent, but they were the last mid-sized venues in London. There are no venues in the centre of London; the galleries are only for the established.<br>One has to go to East London, and, on a rare occasion, Camden to find anything to go to. Occasionally elsewhere. There is a very limited amont of unofficial culture in the city centre. By this, I mean everything, not just what the media represents as youth culture. It is a city centre for people who like galleries and musicals. Nothing wrong with that, it's just a lie if you think it represents what's interesting in the here and now.<br>People have been priced out of so many areas, as have independent pubs, clubs and other such things. You have to have a sponsor, nothing is done off the backs of the willing; only those who have connections and money. The Lib Dem law to make venues under 200 people or so, be able to host gigs again is a positive move, but we need more. London is a diverse city, but its center is not - it is endless monoliths of official culture.<br>Solutions? For every so many chain, there needs to be a smattering of independence. Say, for every 500 clothes stores, there should be a multipurpose venue (an independent pub with a backroom?). For every major brand larger, there should be local breweries (Camden and Meantime provide some of the best beer/larger in the UK at the moment - why aren't they EVERYWHERE in London?)

      "bodyText": "The world's fastest animal, the African cheetah, is losing its ability to reproduce because of climate change, according to Kenyan researchers. Scientists with the National Museums of Kenya (NMK) and the Kenya Wildlife Service have discovered that the animal, Acinonyx jubatus, has developed abnormal coils in its sperm as a result of warmer temperatures, affecting the big cat's ability to reproduce. The warmer temperatures are also affecting its feeding habits, they say. Risky Agwanda, head of mammology section at NMK, said: \"Climate change has contributed to defects of the cheetah sperm. Many have abnormal coils, low sperm counts, as well as extremely low testosterone levels. Change in climate has made the survival of the gazelle difficult to survive and as a result, the cheetah has had to switch to other diets, also affecting its ability to reproduce effectively.\". He added that the animal, that can accelerate from 0-100kph in three seconds, has a sperm count 10 times lower than the domestic cat. \"Cheetahs love to prey on Thomson's gazelles, they have a very high protein content compared to other herbivores and the population of the gazelle has been on a rapid decline due to poor climate conditions and human activities. \"We have studied a large number of the cheetahs. As a result, it preys on other herbivores such as the zebra which do not have a high nutritional content. We discovered that the gazelle diet can actually help maintain the good health of the cheetah sperm if the animal has not yet been negatively affected by poor climate,\" explained Agwanda. There are currently only 1,000 cheetahs in Kenya according to figures from the Kenya Wildlife Service. In the early 1980s, there were more than 5,000 cheetahs in Kenya. As gazelle numbers continue to decrease due to drought, conservation efforts of the cheetah could be badly affected. The gazelles are also crossbreeding with other herbivores, reducing their protein content further, Agwanda said. Scientists have never discovered any reproductive health deficiencies in other big cats, which they say can adapt more to climate change compared to the cheetah. \"The genetic make-up of the animal is more sensitive as compared to the other big cats. The cheetahs have weak genes,\" said Agwanda. Mordecai Ogada, a fellow cheetah researcher at the National Museums, says that also another problem threatening the survival of the animal is conflict between humans and wildlife, resulting in damage to to the cheetha's habitat. Ogada added that cheetah numbers have also declined because of poaching for their skin, which fetches a high price on the black market.",

Joshua Thompson, a Michigan \"security technician\" furious at being prohibited from carrying his own food and drink into the cinema, last week filed a class action against a large American cinema chain. His lawyer claims that for AMC to charge around $8 for a Coke and some chocolate-covered peanuts amounts to price gouging. A professor of business law at Eastern Michigan University has called the suit \"a loser\", but Thompson is not the only cineaste horrified by the price of snacks. From a business point of view, cinemas are only partly about films. \"When we bought [Odeon],\" Guy Hands of private equity group Terra Firma famously said, \"the management team really believed they were part of the film business. I had the difficult job of explaining to them that they were in the popcorn-selling business.\" Cinemas are obliged to split money from ticket sales with the film studios, but get to keep almost all the cash they make from selling food. That means that the \"concessions\" (popcorn, sweets and the like) make up 20% of a cinema's revenue but 40% of its profits. A box of popcorn is around 85% profit to the cinema, and salty foods of course encourage people to buy more soft drinks, increasing receipts further. \"Without the hefty concession profits,\" declared an article in Time a few years ago, \"there would be no movie theater business\". Going to the cinema is now an expensive night out: a tenner or so for an adult ticket is not uncommon. Faced with costly tickets and food alike, it's not surprising that many people smuggle their own scran into cinemas. A postman who was denied entry to a cinema for bringing in his own sweets launched what the Daily Mail called a \"one-man campaign\" against high concession prices a couple of years ago, apparently to little effect. Although Hollywood is having a torrid time in the face of illegal downloads, sales of cinema tickets are largely holding up. Box office receipts rose 8% between 2008 and 2009, even though the biggest studios saw their total revenues fall 4%. (Numbers were down a bit last year because of the recession.)

      "bodyText": "The story that emerged last week of 17 million adults having such poor numeracy skills that they can't understand deductions on wage slips, read bus timetables or pay household bills may have left anyone who teaches school maths thinking: that's terrible, but what's it got to do with me? It's about adult skills, not about what goes on in my classroom. The fact is that adults' and children's experiences of maths and numeracy are all part of the same story. It's a story of a peculiarly British sort: our attitude to maths. National Numeracy, the new charity that highlighted this situation, emphasised the cost to the UK of having so many of its citizens so ill-prepared for life (a while back KPMG put an eye-watering \u00a32.4 billion annual price tag on poor numeracy) - and the cost to the individual in terms of disadvantage. If you've got poor numeracy, you're twice as likely to be unemployed, twice as likely to become a teenage parent, twice as likely to suffer depression. At National Numeracy (where I'm a trustee), we're knee-deep in statistics of this sort. We also know that while adult literacy has improved \u2013 thanks in large part to public attention and money being directed at the problem \u2013 numeracy has got worse. We know too that many adults simply don't like maths and don't see the point of it. Many have no qualms about saying so. Being \"no good at maths\" carries little stigma. That tends not to be the case in other parts of the world. Negative attitudes to maths set in early in the UK \u2013 some would say between the ages of seven and nine, when many children's interest and attainment dip, in most cases never to return. They switch off and decide maths is something to be borne until the moment they can give it up \u2013 for ever. England, Wales and Northern Ireland have the lowest rate of young people continuing with maths beyond 16. (Scotland does a bit better, probably because of a wider curriculum.) The process is then cyclical, with parents (and in some cases \u2013 dare I say? - teachers) passing on their own lack of enthusiasm and confidence to the next generation. Take Paula, the mother interviewed on the Today programme last week. She admitted that, when it came to school maths, she 'just didn't get it'. In adult life, she never knew whether she was being short-changed in shops. But it was when she realised her children thought they were \"rubbish at maths, just like Mum\" that Paula made up her mind to start numeracy classes. With effort and good teaching, she then \"did get it\". When adults do decide to take steps to remedy poor numeracy, helping their children may be the motivation. The relationship between parents and school maths is often troubled. I remember a parents' maths evening at my children's infant school some years ago. There were fantastic displays of tactile maths equipment - this was well before the digital age \u2013 but very little explanation. We parents (the relatively small number of us that bothered to turn up) traipsed around looking by stages impressed and puzzled. Eventually the woman next to me whispered: \"It's all very well, but what about their times tables?\" My generation of primary school pupils didn't have the imaginative resources that my children did, we did chant our tables before we had any understanding of what they meant and most of us still didn't end up loving maths. It would seem there never was a golden age. So why, by secondary school, does maths still become one of the most hated subjects? Is it the way it's taught, the way teachers are trained, the failure to attract enough talented mathematicians who also have a gift for teaching, or just the old problem \u2013 our failure to take maths seriously? Well possibly all of those to some degree. At National Numeracy, we don't believe any child \u2013 or adult \u2013 can be written off as being no good at maths. In her book The Elephant in the Classroom, Jo Boaler talks about \"learning without thought\". One of the girls she interviewed said: \"In maths you have to remember; in other subjects you can think about it\". If maths can be presented as a collaborative, stimulating, problem-solving activity relevant to real life, then maybe more children would avoid joining the ranks of the adult innumerate. But as it is, for all the kids in the UK who are thrilled to be taking part in World Maths Day activities today, there are many more who aren't and who regard maths as a waste of time. Changing young minds won't happen overnight, but it has to be done. \u2022 Wendy Jones is a trustee of National Numeracy and a former BBC education correspondent Numeracy resources on Guardian Teacher Network Creativity in maths Animal Accounting Reggae two times table Multiplication fortune teller This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "A crackdown on generous tax breaks for pension contributions for top earners could be on the cards in behind-the-scenes coalition negotiations in the runup to the budget. New curbs on the tax relief given to high earners are being examined as the Liberal Democrats concede that David Cameron is unlikely to bow to calls for a so-called mansion tax in exchange for scrapping the 50p top rate of tax, according to the Times (paywall). The move to target high earners, particularly those earning more than \u00a3150,000 a year, would be part of the coalition trade-off that would allow the chancellor, George Osborne, to abolish the 50p rate before the 2015 election as Cameron remains resistant to the Lib Dems' favoured 1% tax on the value of a home above \u00a32m. However, a source told the Times the issues were \"by no means in any way close to being concluded\". On Tuesday Vince Cable, the Lib Dem business secretary, appeared to indicate that the mansion tax was on the negotiating table as a an offering the Tories might exchange for his party's agreement to the scrapping of the 50p tax rate. He told Radio 4's Today programme: \"If the 50p rate were to go \u2013 and I and my colleagues are not ideologically wedded to the 50p tax rate \u2013 if that were to go, it should be replaced by taxation of wealth, because the wealthy people of the country have got to pay their share, particularly at a time of economic difficulty. \"How exactly that is configured is a detailed matter for negotiation, but that principle must be upheld, and the mansion tax is actually a very economically sensible way of doing it. But there are different ways of approaching it.\" But by Tuesday night, senior Liberal Democrat sources played down the prospects for a mansion tax, saying they could support the abolition of the 50p rate as long as its funding came from some other form of tax on the wealthy. The Times said the curb on tax relief for higher earners, which could raise billions of pounds a year, was one of the other ideas they had put forward. Osborne is more open to the idea of a tax on wealth than the prime minister, who is highly suspicious of increasing tax on property. The chancellor believes that the best bet is to close down loopholes on stamp duty that allow millionaires to register new properties in the name of overseas companies. This means they pay 0.5% in stamp duty on properties worth more than \u00a31m rather than the standard 5%. Osborne warned on Tuesday that there would be no \"unfunded giveaways\" in the budget on 21 March. In a speech to the annual dinner of the EEF manufacturers' organisation, he said: \"By facing difficult decisions head on, we have won the credibility which will allow us to constrain inflationary pressure, support long-term low interest rates and provided the stability that creates the space for private sector investment. I have a budget in two weeks' time, I can tell you: we are not going to put that credibility and stability and low interest rates at risk. \"The days of unfunded giveaways are over \u2013 and they're not coming back in this budget. Everything has to be paid for.\" As Osborne prepared his budget, the government's handling of economic recovery was questioned in a leaked letter sent by Cable to the prime minister in which he warned that the government lacked a \"compelling vision\" beyond tackling Britain's record fiscal deficit. The business secretary told Cameron in his letter that the government could not rely on markets alone to revive the economy, and called on No 10 to accept that the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to be broken up. In the most sensitive section, Cable wrote: \"I sense \u2026 that there is still something important missing: a compelling vision of where the country is heading beyond sorting out the fiscal mess; and a clear and confident message about how we will earn our living in future \u2026 We can be more strategic and the economic backdrop will increase demands that we are ambitious.\" Lord Tebbit, a former cabinet secretary, claimed Cable's intervention on the wealth tax and the leaked letter were for party political reasons ahead of the Lib Dems' spring conference and the local elections. Tebbit told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"The normal way in which government works has broken down. Mr Cable's letter should not have surfaced in this way at all. These are matters that should be thrashed out between colleagues in an orderly fashion, as we used to, through the means of cabinet and cabinet committees, before individuals give vent to ideas and thoughts which, if they'd talked them through with their colleagues, they might have realised were misplaced.\" Tebbit called the possibility of adding a mansion tax to the 50p rate \"madness\". He said: \"There is a case to be argued over the 50p tax rate but if it goes it doesn't need to be replaced with anything, because it actually reduces revenue, not increases it. Everyone knows that. And there's an argument to be had over whether you should tax capital or not. Some people think you should. But that's an argument you conduct in a civilised matter with colleagues. You don't break down the entire way government works just for the sake of making a political point for your party conference.\" The leaking of the letter coincided with a speech by Ed Miliband in which the Labour leader called for new patriotic economic policy to give British firms a better chance of competing with their foreign rivals. Miliband accused the coalition of letting British business down by sticking to the view that government should \"get out of the way\". \"To work, an active industrial strategy must have real vision, real drive right across government,\" said Miliband. \"And I don't think the government gets it.\"",

It centres on a pseudo-religious movement named the Cause, which has been compared by some to Scientology. \"I know you guys are waiting on a release date for The Master,\" said Ellison in a response to an inquiry from Anderson fan site Cigarettes and Red Vines. \"It's still a bit early, but I'd keep my eyes on October.\" An autumn release would position The Master for a festival debut \u2013 perhaps at the New York film festival in late September/early October if it is not ready for Toronto or Venice \u2013 followed by an awards season run from December if the film draws positive reviews. There Will Be Blood won two Oscars in 2008, including the best actor gong for Daniel Day-Lewis, and was nominated for eight in total. The Master marks the fifth collaboration between Anderson and Seymour Hoffman, who also appeared in his debut feature Hard Eight back in 1996 along with supporting roles in Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. Hoffman plays a charismatic intellectual with more than a hint of Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard, who launches a faith-based organisation in the wake of the second world war. Phoenix plays a young drifter who joins the group and becomes Hoffman's right-hand man, but later begins to doubt its ideals and ambitions. Though its budget is said to be a reasonably modest $35m, Anderson reportedly struggled to find financing for The Master before Ellison came on board, leading to a two-year delay between 2009 and last year. The film will once again feature music from Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, who scored There Will Be Blood.",

Staff at the department stores and Waitrose supermarkets will share \u00a3165.2m, to receive a bonus of 14% of salary. That is down from the 18% enjoyed by the staff who co-own the retail group last year. The partnership announced the bonus cut after reporting a 3.8% fall in annual pre-tax and pre-bonus profits to \u00a3353.8m. Gross sales were up 6.4% to \u00a38.73bn. The company said that after a tough economic backdrop to 2011, trading conditions were still difficult and consumer confidence remained subdued. It was continuing to grow faster than the market. The chairman, Charlie Mayfield, said: \"We have achieved a good sales performance in a tough year for the economy. Profits are lower than last year, but better than expected and I'm delighted to announce that all 81,000 partners will be receiving a bonus equivalent to over seven weeks' pay.\" He predicted the Queen's diamond jubilee and the Olympic Games would provide a lift for consumers, adding: \"I am cautiously optimistic that trading conditions may improve later this year.\" Within the group, profits slumped fastest at the department stores. John Lewis operating profits dropped 20.4% to \u00a3157.9m while at Waitrose they were down 5.2% to \u00a3260.6m. The group put the fall at the department stores down to the way it allocates pension costs and to three other main factors: its efforts to keep prices competitive; the costs of opening new stores including at Stratford City, east London, and lower sales at nearly all its established shops.",

      "bodyText": "I've long been intrigued by the idea of the past as a fantasy world: a place where real things happened but also a place which is essentially beyond knowing; where worlds can be built and events created which play on what we think we know of what went before. My novel The English Monster takes an awful historical event - the Ratcliffe Highway murders of 1811 - and provides a motive for them which is stolen from history, but which is also impossible. The trick is to do this without being a fraud. Inventing the past from scratch is simply invention. Re-inventing it within the confines of the known facts, as far as they can be known, is a much more creative and fruitful exercise. My list of books focuses on this central idea - that history is a fantasy which can be reestablished by the author - and takes it in all sorts of directions. An architect who might be a devil-worshipper; a codebreaker and a coder who between them create a new world; an imagined past where cultural artefacts and real events become so entwined that it is impossible to tell where one begins and the other ends - they're all here. I've called them collectively 'weird histories', but would want to remind those reading of the original meaning of weird as (according to the OED) relating to a person \"claiming or thought to have the power to foresee and control future events; a witch, a wizard, a soothsayer.\" In other words, our future is created - culturally as well as politically - in our weird past. 1. Hawksmoor by Peter Ackroyd Few authors have immersed themselves in the past as fruitfully as Ackroyd, who adds a rich, palpable sense of place to his historical research (in this case, as in so much of his writing, the place is London). In Hawksmoor, Ackroyd connects the activities of brilliant 18th century architect Nicholas Dyer with modern police detective Nicholas Hawksmoor; the joke being, of course, that it was N Hawksmoor who was the 18th century architect, assistant to Wren but also combiner of myths and traditions in strange, brooding buildings which seem to speak to more than they show. Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson Stephenson's playful, fearless novel combines a second world war adventure story with mathematical puzzles and global geopolitics. It places three fictional characters - Lawrence Prichard Waterhouse, his grandson Randy, and American all-action hero Bobby Shaftoe - within a tale that describes how mathematics and cryptography created the digitised world. The novel includes a series of dazzling action sequences and hugely clever jokes; for instance, the sequence where Waterhouse and Alan Turing spend several pages knocking back and forth equations which are used to calculate the probability of the chain coming off Turing's bike. Stephenson repeated the dazzling tricks of Crytonomicon with The Baroque Trilogy, three massive tomes telling the story of the Royal Society, the beginning of science and the formation of the modern world through the creation of financial debt instruments (in these books, it is the invention of debt that allows England to defeat France - I wonder what Stephenson makes of that idea now). But read Cryptonomicon first. 11.22.63 by Stephen King Even those who don't like him - who consider him the white sliced bread of the modern novel - have to acknowledge King's mastery of longform storytelling, and the appeal of this enormous volume is that of observing a true narrative watchmaker at work. King takes a tired old theme - what if you could go back in time and stop something awful happening? - and then works it through with patience, charisma and hard-won skill. If HG Wells had written The Time Machine in the early 21st century, it would have looked something like this. It counts as a weird history, too, because it takes characters who have become two-dimensional myths - specifically, Lee Harvey Oswald - and makes them breathe again through the context of a modern narrator. Masterful. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen by Alan Moore It's one thing to take a fictional character and place him or her inside a real history; it's quite another to take a set of other people's fictional characters and then place them within a world that combines real history with the cultural artefacts of a civilisation. Alan Moore, the dark clown prince of comics, took Wilhelmina Murray (married name: Mina Harker) from Dracula and hooked her up with Doctor Jekyll, Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain, the Invisible Man and Orlando (among others) and, in a series of comics which become ever more elaborate and intricate, propels them through worlds of imagination that take their internal logic from the myths and stories of the last 200 years. My personal favourite is The Black Dossier, which finds Harker, Quartermain and Orlando on the run from Bulldog Drummond and James Bond, who themselves work for a sinister organisation which arose from the ashes of Ingsoc and is run by old boys from Billy Bunter's Greyfriars. It's as mad and wonderful as it sounds. Note: any reference to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen must come with a health warning to avoid the film version at all costs. The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet by David Mitchell Not entirely \"weird\", although plenty of odd stuff happens, but here because it describes a past in such a resolutely modern way that the vanished worlds come alive again, brightly and brilliantly (I could just as easily have chosen Wolf Hall). It is set in 1799 in Nagasaki Harbour, where the island of Dejima is joined by a gate to the mainland and is the only connection between Japan and the outside world. The Dutch East India Company holds the trading rights on the island, and it sends along a new employee, Jacob de Zoet, a young clerk from the Netherlands who falls for the disfigured daughter of a samurai doctor. An extraordinary achievement of research and style, this is a book which describes a moment and a place in history that are so surpassingly odd as to be distinctly weird. SS-GB by Len Deighton Unsurprisingly, given the binary good vs evil narrative of the second world war, \"what if?\" stories based on the period are legion. Robert Harris notably mined the seam with Fatherland, but my favourite is SS-GB. Douglas Archer (a name which resounds with both Bader and Agincourt) is a homicide detective working in Nazi-occupied Britain, who uncovers a London murder case which, inevitably, leads to the upper reaches of the Nazi occupation government. I read it as a teenager, and was horrorstruck by it. World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War by Max Brooks Ah, zombies. Zombies, zombies, everywhere. Why exactly? Perhaps because zombie stories lend themselves particularly well to establishing a world which is both real and shockingly different; zombies are like us, of course, only much, much weirder. World War Z is here as a pastiche history of the Zombie War, which (as I'm sure you remember) came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Brooks creates a set of invented interviews and documents to describe the growth of the zombie plague, and the dispassionate documentation works brilliantly as a means of establishing and then slowly ratcheting up horror. Zombies work in comics and movies, in books not so much - apart from this one. The Anubis Gates by Tim Powers Powers struck commercial gold with his novel On Stranger Tides, which was used as the source material for the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film. But he's made his name by writing weird histories, specifically as I've defined them: taking documented historical events and then adding a supernatural twist to them, either to fill a gap or to explain the inexplicable. In The Anubis Gates he goes to town on this idea, his hero a modern Coleridge scholar who finds himself trapped in 1810 battling a cabal of magicians and ancient Egyptian gods against the background of rising British military power in the Middle East. Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro Kazuo Ishiguro is the master of small things beautifully described, and in Never Let Me Go he takes a well-established archetype - a boarding school in the English countryside - and slowly subverts it. His characters live in a world which is quintessentially English and yet somehow exquisitely different. The location of this difference gradually becomes apparent, and allows Ishiguro to ask a simple question: what would a world look like in which a major biological breakthrough had happened in the recent past? His world is one reeling from an ethical explosion which works its way out, beautifully and very, very sadly. The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln No weird history is as satisfying as a conspiracy, and The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail is here as the archetypal expression of perhaps the biggest conspiracy of all, one which connects popes, scientists, presidents, prime ministers, Christ and even Dan Brown in a chain of association (\"what if this meant this?\") so elaborate and persistent one can only admire the authors' stamina. The core assertion - that Christ did not die on the cross, but sired a line of \"children of God\" who are protected to this day by a secret society - was taken by Brown as the engine of The Da Vinci Code, featuring a character called Leigh Teabing whose name, of course, is an amalgum of two of the authors of The Holy Bloody and the Holy Grail. Brown was sued by the authors for lifting whole parts of their book for his own; the presiding judge said this could not be plagiarism, as they had presented their book as a history, the facts of which should be available to other authors to use. The irony of this is so exquisite Christ himself would crack a smile. Lloyd Shepherd was born in 1966. He lives in South London with his wife and two children.

      "body": "<p>I've long been intrigued by the idea of the past as a fantasy world: a place where real things happened but also a place which is essentially beyond knowing; where worlds can be built and events created which play on what we think we know of what went before. My novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780857205353/the-english-monster\">The English Monster</a> takes an awful historical event - the <a href=\"http://www.thamespolicemuseum.org.uk/h_ratcliffehighwaymurders_1.html\">Ratcliffe Highway murders of 1811</a> - and provides a motive for them which is stolen from history, but which is also impossible. </p> <p>The trick is to do this without being a fraud. Inventing the past from scratch is simply invention. Re-inventing it within the confines of the known facts, as far as they can be known, is a much more creative and fruitful exercise.</p> <p>My list of books focuses on this central idea - that history is a fantasy which can be reestablished by the author - and takes it in all sorts of directions. An architect who might be a devil-worshipper; a codebreaker and a coder who between them create a new world; an imagined past where cultural artefacts and real events become so entwined that it is impossible to tell where one begins and the other ends - they're all here. I've called them collectively 'weird histories', but would want to remind those reading of the original meaning of weird as (according to the OED) relating to a person \"claiming or thought to have the power to foresee and control future events; a witch, a wizard, a soothsayer.\" In other words, our future is created - culturally as well as politically - in our weird past.</p> <h2><br>1. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/crime/9780141042015/hawksmoor\">Hawksmoor</a> by Peter Ackroyd</h2> <p>Few authors have immersed themselves in the past as fruitfully as Ackroyd, who adds a rich, palpable sense of place to his historical research (in this case, as in so much of his writing, the place is London). In Hawksmoor, Ackroyd connects the activities of brilliant 18th century architect Nicholas Dyer with modern police detective Nicholas Hawksmoor; the joke being, of course, that it was N Hawksmoor who was the 18th century architect, assistant to Wren but also combiner of myths and traditions in strange, brooding buildings which seem to speak to more than they show.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/science-fiction/9780099410676/cryptonomicon\">Cryptonomicon</a> by Neal Stephenson</h2> <p>Stephenson's playful, fearless novel combines a second world war adventure story with mathematical puzzles and global geopolitics. It places three fictional characters - Lawrence Prichard Waterhouse, his grandson Randy, and American all-action hero Bobby Shaftoe - within a tale that describes how mathematics and cryptography created the digitised world. The novel includes a series of dazzling action sequences and hugely clever jokes; for instance, the sequence where Waterhouse and Alan Turing spend several pages knocking back and forth equations which are used to calculate the probability of the chain coming off Turing's bike. Stephenson repeated the dazzling tricks of Crytonomicon with The Baroque Trilogy, three massive tomes telling the story of the Royal Society, the beginning of science and the formation of the modern world through the creation of financial debt instruments (in these books, it is the invention of debt that allows England to defeat France - I wonder what Stephenson makes of that idea now). But read Cryptonomicon first.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781444727296/stephen-king\">11.22.63</a> by Stephen King</h2> <p>Even those who don't like him - who consider him the white sliced bread of the modern novel - have to acknowledge King's mastery of longform storytelling, and the appeal of this enormous volume is that of observing a true narrative watchmaker at work. King takes a tired old theme - what if you could go back in time and stop something awful happening? - and then works it through with patience, charisma and hard-won skill. If HG Wells had written The Time Machine in the early 21st century, it would have looked something like this. It counts as a weird history, too, because it takes characters who have become two-dimensional myths - specifically, Lee Harvey Oswald - and makes them breathe again through the context of a modern narrator. Masterful.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/comics/9781840233025/the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen\">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> by Alan Moore</h2> <p>It's one thing to take a fictional character and place him or her inside a real history; it's quite another to take a set of other people's fictional characters and then place them within a world that combines real history with the cultural artefacts of a civilisation. Alan Moore, the dark clown prince of comics, took Wilhelmina Murray (married name: Mina Harker) from Dracula and hooked her up with Doctor Jekyll, Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain, the Invisible Man and Orlando (among others) and, in a series of comics which become ever more elaborate and intricate, propels them through worlds of imagination that take their internal logic from the myths and stories of the last 200 years. My personal favourite is The Black Dossier, which finds Harker, Quartermain and Orlando on the run from Bulldog Drummond and James Bond, who themselves work for a sinister organisation which arose from the ashes of Ingsoc and is run by old boys from Billy Bunter's Greyfriars. It's as mad and wonderful as it sounds. Note: any reference to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen must come with a health warning to avoid the film version at all costs.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780340921562/the-thousand-autumns-of-jacob-de-zoet\">The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</a> by David Mitchell</h2> <p>Not entirely \"weird\", although plenty of odd stuff happens, but here because it describes a past in such a resolutely modern way that the vanished worlds come alive again, brightly and brilliantly (I could just as easily have chosen Wolf Hall). It is set in 1799 in Nagasaki Harbour, where the island of Dejima is joined by a gate to the mainland and is the only connection between Japan and the outside world. The Dutch East India Company holds the trading rights on the island, and it sends along a new employee, Jacob de Zoet, a young clerk from the Netherlands who falls for the disfigured daughter of a samurai doctor. An extraordinary achievement of research and style, this is a book which describes a moment and a place in history that are so surpassingly odd as to be distinctly weird.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780099856405/ss-gb\">SS-GB</a> by Len Deighton</h2> <p>Unsurprisingly, given the binary good vs evil narrative of the second world war, \"what if?\" stories based on the period are legion. Robert Harris notably mined the seam with Fatherland, but my favourite is SS-GB. Douglas Archer (a name which resounds with both Bader and Agincourt) is a homicide detective working in Nazi-occupied Britain, who uncovers a London murder case which, inevitably, leads to the upper reaches of the Nazi occupation government. I read it as a teenager, and was horrorstruck by it.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9780786293483/world-war-z-an-oral-history-of-the-zombie-war\">World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War</a> by Max Brooks<br></h2> <p>Ah, zombies. Zombies, zombies, everywhere. Why exactly? Perhaps because zombie stories lend themselves particularly well to establishing a world which is both real and shockingly different; zombies are like us, of course, only much, much weirder. World War Z is here as a pastiche history of the Zombie War, which (as I'm sure you remember) came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Brooks creates a set of invented interviews and documents to describe the growth of the zombie plague, and the dispassionate documentation works brilliantly as a means of establishing and then slowly ratcheting up horror. Zombies work in comics and movies, in books not so much - apart from this one.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fantasy/9780575077256/the-anubis-gates\">The Anubis Gates</a> by Tim Powers</h2> <p>Powers struck commercial gold with his novel On Stranger Tides, which was used as the source material for the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film. But he's made his name by writing weird histories, specifically as I've defined them: taking documented historical events and then adding a supernatural twist to them, either to fill a gap or to explain the inexplicable. In The Anubis Gates he goes to town on this idea, his hero a modern Coleridge scholar who finds himself trapped in 1810 battling a cabal of magicians and ancient Egyptian gods against the background of rising British military power in the Middle East.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571258093/never-let-me-go\">Never Let Me Go</a> by Kazuo Ishiguro</h2> <p>Kazuo Ishiguro is the master of small things beautifully described, and in Never Let Me Go he takes a well-established archetype - a boarding school in the English countryside - and slowly subverts it. His characters live in a world which is quintessentially English and yet somehow exquisitely different. The location of this difference gradually becomes apparent, and allows Ishiguro to ask a simple question: what would a world look like in which a major biological breakthrough had happened in the recent past? His world is one reeling from an ethical explosion which works its way out, beautifully and very, very sadly.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/religion/9780099503095/the-holy-blood-and-the-holy-grail\">The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail</a> by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln</h2> <p>No weird history is as satisfying as a conspiracy, and The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail is here as the archetypal expression of perhaps the biggest conspiracy of all, one which connects popes, scientists, presidents, prime ministers, Christ and even Dan Brown in a chain of association (\"what if this meant this?\") so elaborate and persistent one can only admire the authors' stamina. The core assertion - that Christ did not die on the cross, but sired a line of \"children of God\" who are protected to this day by a secret society - was taken by Brown as the engine of The Da Vinci Code, featuring a character called Leigh Teabing whose name, of course, is an amalgum of two of the authors of The Holy Bloody and the Holy Grail. Brown was sued by the authors for lifting whole parts of their book for his own; the presiding judge said this could not be plagiarism, as they had presented their book as a history, the facts of which should be available to other authors to use. The irony of this is so exquisite Christ himself would crack a smile.</p> <p><em><br>Lloyd Shepherd was born in 1966. He lives in South London with his wife and two children.

      "bodyText": "The number of UK service personnel killed in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001 will have reached 404 if the six deaths in an explosion in Helmand province are confirmed. The grim milestone came weeks after the government announced that British troops would end their lead combat role in the country by the end of next year. Britain still has 9,500 troops in Afghanistan and the government has been under pressure to detail its withdrawal strategy but has refused until the US makes a decision. France said in January that it would consider withdrawing all its forces early, after four French troops were killed by a rogue Afghan soldier at a base east of Kabul. There were only five British deaths in operations in Afghanistan before 2006 when the Taliban intensified its campaign against foreign forces. The bloodiest year for UK troops was 2009, when 108 were killed, as insurgents turned to improvised explosive devices to target British soldiers involved in Operation Moshtarak, aimed at shoring up Afghan government control in southern Helmand. In 2010, 103 people were killed but last year the figure fell to 46. The rate of British deaths slowed last year as a result of the deployment of US troops to Helmand. The last 100 losses, taking the total from 300 to 400, were suffered over a period of 21 months. By contrast, it took about half that time for the death toll to rise from 200 to 300. However, the civilian death toll across the country continues to rise. Last year, civilian deaths reached a record high of 3,021, according to the United Nations, the fifth consecutive rise. The number of British deaths in Afghanistan is far higher than in Iraq or the Falklands conflict. The number of British troops wounded in the country since 1 January 2006, stands at more than 5,000 with more than 10% of those suffering serious or very serious injuries. The Ministry of Defence does not have a clear record of how many wounded there were before the beginning of 2006. Most British troops will have returned home by 2014, when the Afghan security forces will be in sole charge of combat operations against insurgents. The Nato-led force is 130,000-strong and has suffered more than 2,900 deaths since 2001. The US has by far the largest military presence in Afghanistan, with about 90,000 troops, and has suffered the most deaths \u2013 1,909 \u2013 according to the iCasualties website.",

      "bodyText": "The moment that launched the career of the greatest athlete the world has ever known very nearly didn\u2019t happen. A fear of flying meant Cassius Clay tried to withdraw from the 1960 Olympic Games just weeks before the US team travelled to Rome. The 18-year-old from Louisville had been on planes before. He just didn\u2019t like them very much. A rocky flight to California for the Olympic trials cemented his view that, aside from when he was dancing in the ring, his feet should remain on the ground. In later years he became a master of disguising his fears (of Sonny Liston, George Foreman or Joe Frazier) but the teenage Clay had no qualms revealing he was scared. He asked if he could go to Rome by sea. He asked if he could make his way there by train. When told neither was possible he decided he could do without the Olympic Games. He was destined for greatness with or without a medal dangling from his neck. In the end it took a meeting with Joe Martin in Louisville\u2019s Central Park to convince him to travel. Martin was the policeman and boxing trainer who told a pepped-up 12-year-old that if he really wanted to deal with the thief who stole his bike, he should first learn how to fight. \u201cHe was afraid of flying,\u201d Martin told an HBO Muhammad Ali special. \u201cWe had a rough flight going to California for the trials and so when it came to go to Rome he said he wasn\u2019t gonna fly, and that he wouldn\u2019t go. I said: \u2018Well, you\u2019ll lose the opportunity of being a great fighter,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Well, I\u2019m not gonna go.\u2019 He wanted to take a boat or something. Anyway I finally took him out to Central Park here in Louisville and we had a long talk for a couple or three hours, and I calmed him down and convinced him if he wanted to be heavyweight champion of the world, then he had to go to Rome and win the Olympics.\u201d So Clay travelled to Rome by aeroplane. But he came prepared. Before departing he visited an army surplus store and purchased a parachute, which he kept strapped on throughout the flight. Accounts differ as to Clay\u2019s behaviour once the flight was airborne. In David Remnick\u2019s King of the World Joe Martin\u2019s son, Joe Jr, claims that during a rough flight Clay prayed in the aisle with the parachute on his back. Others recall Clay distracting himself from his fears by holding forth on the flight and decreeing who among the boxing team would win a gold medal. Obviously he included himself in this select group. Clay\u2019s credentials as an amateur boxer were there for all to see: 100 victories in 108 bouts, six Kentucky Golden Gloves championships, successive light-heavyweight National Amateur Athletic Union titles (1959 and 1960) and two Golden Gloves titles in a row (1959 and 1960). Before the Games, Sports Illustrated declared that he was the USA\u2019s best hope for a medal in boxing, but there was no real sense that a worldwide star was about to be unleashed. The only hype and fanfare came from Clay himself, but behind the brash statements was a training regime that was anything but amateur. Training began each day at 4am as he pounded his steel-toed work boots through the deadened streets of Louisville. John Powell, who worked at a liquor dispensary, told Sports Illustrated of the shadowy figure who came trudging the streets in the dead of night. \u201cI\u2019d be sitting on the counter,\u201d Powell said, \u201cand I could see his shadow coming around the corner from Grand Avenue. Clay was on his way to Chicksaw Park. Cold, dark winter mornings. You could see that shadow coming. Then here he comes, running by, with those big old army brogans. He\u2019d be the onliest person in the early morning. And I\u2019d walk outside, and he\u2019d stop and shadowbox. He once said to me: \u2018Someday you\u2019ll own this liquor store and I\u2019ll be heavyweight champion of the world.\u2019 Both of those came true, too.\u201d But first there was Rome to deal with. There is a tendency to talk up the profound impact Clay had as he wandered the Olympic Village shaking as many hands as possible, like a politician on the campaign trail. There is a tendency to say everyone could see they were in the presence of greatness. In his book, Rome 1960: The Olympics That Changed the World, David Maraniss writes: \u201cIn retrospect, because of the worldwide fame he gained later as Muhammad Ali, there is a temptation to present him as a larger than life figure at the Rome Olympics than he really was. He was ebullient and memorable from the start, but he was not the leader of the US delegation. It was Clay seeking out people, not people seeking out Clay.\u201d Clay made an impact on the people he met and earned the nickname \u201cthe mayor of the Olympic Village\u201d. In his peerless biography of Muhammad Ali, Thomas Hauser recalls one unnamed team-mate saying: \u201cYou would have thought he was running for mayor. He went around introducing himself and learning other people\u2019s names and swapping team lapel pins. If they\u2019d had an election, he would have won in a walk.\u201d As he advanced through the rounds, Clay also became a favourite with the local crowds thanks to a style which, at that stage, was seen as highly unorthodox and, by many of boxing\u2019s old guard, as unnecessarily carefree. Clay\u2019s opening fight, against the Belgian Yvon Becaus, was stopped by the referee in the second round. He then beat the Russian Gennadiy Shatkov, who had won middleweight gold medal at the 1956 Games in Melbourne, in a unanimous points decision. In the semi-final Clay faced Australia\u2019s Tony Madigan. Again he triumphed in a unanimous decision but many observers felt Madigan was hard done by. A 2010 article in Louisville\u2019s Courier-Journal to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his gold medal has Bud Palmer, a CBS presenter, saying he felt that Clay had been beaten by the Australian. In the final Clay came up against Zbigniew \u2018Ziggy\u2019 Pietrzykowski, \u201ca portly coffeehouse keeper\u201d from Poland who was somewhere between 25 and 28, depending on whom you believe. The fight before the light-heavyweight final also pitched a Pole against one of the US team. Eddie Crook\u2019s victory over Tadeusz Walasek drew furious howls of derision from the crowd packed into the Palazzo della Sport. Their angry cries reached the dressing room, where Clay was in the final stages of his preparation. \u201cThe people made me fight harder than I should have,\u201d he told the Courier-Journal. \u201cWhen they booed five minutes after Crook\u2019s win and I was the next American in the ring, I knew I had to leave no doubts.\u201d Such was Clay\u2019s popularity that the crowd\u2019s mood seemed to change as soon as he came to the ring. But a resolution to leave no doubt in the mind of the audience and judges was one thing, but putting it into practice against the more experienced and physically stronger Pole was another, as the British journalist John Cottrell recalled: \u201cIn the first round, it seemed that Clay would be badly mauled. He was confused by his opponent\u2019s southpaw style, took some heavy punishment, and once showed his inexperience by closing his eyes in the face of a barrage of blows. Clay managed to keep out of trouble in the second round, and in the last minute he abandoned his show-off style with the fancy footwork and dropped hands, and stood his ground to throw four hard rights to the head. Even so, he was still behind on points at this stage. \u2018I knew,\u2019 he explained afterwards, \u2018that I had to take the third round big to win.\u2019 \u201cClay did finish big. In that final round he suddenly found his top form, moving in and out with expert judgment, punching crisply and with perfect timing. This sharper, better co-ordinated Clay stormed back with a torrent of combination punching which left Pietrzykowski dazed. He no longer relied too much on his left jab, but made equal use of his right to penetrate the southpaw\u2019s guard. Ripping into the stamina-lacking Pole, he drew blood and came preciously close to scoring a knockout. At the final bell, Pietrzykowski was slumped helplessly against the ropes. There was no doubting the verdict. All the judges made Clay the points winner.\u201d The photograph which shows Clay receiving his medal can, in itself, be seen as a symbol of the changes that were about to take place not just in boxing, but in society as a whole. To Clay\u2019s left stands the bloodied Pietrzykowski, to his right the bronze medallists Giulio Saraudi and Madigan. They are wizened fighters of the old school. Between them, standing tall and gleaming, is Cassius Clay. WHAT THEY SAID Coverage of the victory suggests the media did not fully grasp the potential of the 18-year-old standing in front of them. The Guardian merely carried the result in the following day\u2019s paper, while the New York Times carried a brief report of the final on 5 September 1960. The account read: \u201cCassius Clay, an 18-year-old Louisville light-heavyweight, gave the United States its third gold medal in boxing tonight when he soundly whipped Ziggy Pietrzykowski, an experienced Polish Olympian, in the 178-pound Olympic final. \u201cClay battered the Pole mercilessly in the last round with a flurry of left and right combinations that had his rival groggy. He opened a cut over the Pole\u2019s left eye and almost finished him. It was a unanimous 5-0 decision by the judges. This one went down well with the crowd of 16,000, which also cheered the Pole. \u201cThe 25-year-old Pole, the bronze medal winner in 1956, who has had 231 fights, met his master. It took the American a little while to counteract his opponent\u2019s southpaw style but by the third round he had it figured out. There were no knockdowns.\u201d The day after Clay won gold, in a piece headlined \u201cThe Gladiators\u201d, the New York Times journalist Arthur Daley gives but a passing mention to Clay\u2019s achievement as the article focuses on the gold medal won by Clay\u2019s room-mate in Rome, the light-middleweight Willie \u2018Skeeter\u2019 McClure, and other members of the US boxing team, as well as the atmosphere in the arena in Rome. The mention of Clay reads: \u201cThen Cassius Marcellus Clay of Louisville followed the script of another Cassius and bloodied his Caesar, even though this Caesar bore the rather unappropriate [sic] name of Zbigniew Pietrzykowski. No Roman was he, but a Polish light-heavyweight.\u201d But by the following May, Daley had realised that the boy in the ring that autumn night could turn out to be something special, and wrote about his blossoming professional career as well as his triumph in Rome. Things appear larger in the rear-view mirror. \u201cCassius was easily one of the most popular athletes in the Villaggio Olimpico last summer,\u201d Daley wrote. \u201cHe was winning friends and influencing people everywhere. If he craves publicity, he also attracts it with the inexorability of a magnet drawing steel filings.\u201d Daley\u2019s piece, perhaps unknowingly, anticipated the radicalisation of Clay, who would renounce his slave name after he beat Sonny Liston to become heavyweight champion of the world in 1964. \u201cThe proudest of all Olympic champions was Cassius Marcellus Clay, the great-great-grandson of a slave who borrowed the name from his owner, the Cassius Marcellus Clay who was ambassador to Russia and kin to Henry Clay. When the gold chain with the Olympic gold medal was draped around the boy\u2019s neck in the Pallazzo della Sport, there it remained. \u201c\u2019I didn\u2019t take that medal off for 48 hours,\u2019 said Clay. \u2018I even wore it to bed. I didn\u2019t sleep too good because I had to sleep on my back so that the medal wouldn\u2019t cut me. But I didn\u2019t care, I was Olympic champion.\u2019 \u201cHe flew back to New York and paraded in his Olympic blazer around Times Square, his Olympic medal still draped around him. Since folks had seen him on television and since he carried his own advertising signs, he was recognised wherever he went and he loved it.\u201d Others, in the immediate aftermath of the Olympics, focused on Clay\u2019s style, which was not to the liking of traditionalists. In his biography, Hauser lists the \u201cdean of boxing writers\u201d, AJ Liebling, as saying: \u201cI watched Clay\u2019s performance in Rome, and considered it attractive but not probative. Clay had a skittering style, like a pebble over water. He was good to watch, but he seemed to make only glancing contact. It is true that the Pole finished the three-round bout helpless and out on his feet.\u201d WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? Clay returned to the US with all the evidence he needed to turn professional dangling around his neck. Dick Schaap, then assistant sports editor at Newsweek, had met Clay along with other US fighters before the Games, impressing them by taking them to Sugar Ray Robinson\u2019s restaurant in Harlem, and Schaap was there to meet Clay at Idlewild airport when he touched down from Rome. As Schaap recalled in an article \u2013 \u201cMuhammad Ali: then and now\u201d \u2013 for Sport magazine, together they embarked on an endless night which took in Times Square, where Clay had a phony newspaper printed up which said \u201cClay signs up to fight Paterson\u201d, they had cheesecake in Jack Dempsey\u2019s restaurant and a drink in the jazz bar across the street, where he sampled his first ever drop of alcohol \u2013 literally a drop \u2013 which he asked them to put in his Coke. All the while Clay seemed amazed that people knew who he was. Girls were interested while men just wanted to shake his hand. Of course it helped that he was wearing a sports jacket with USA emblazoned on the back and had a gold medal engraved with Pugilato around his neck. Their night ended in the suite in the Waldorf Towers (paid for by a Louisville businessman who hoped to manage Clay) where the Olympic champion spent an hour showing Schaap photographs he had taken in Rome. Eventually, as Schaap recalls, he had to go to bed. \u201c\u2019Cassius,\u2019 I said, \u2018you\u2019re going to have to explain to my wife tomorrow why I didn\u2019t get home tonight.\u2019 \u2018You mean,\u2019 said Cassius, \u2018your wife knows who I is, too?\u2019\u201d The perceived wisdom, largely drawn from Ali\u2019s autobiography The Greatest: My Own Story (which he claimed not to have read) is that Clay later threw his gold medal into the Ohio river after a Louisville restaurant refused to serve him and a motorcycle gang threatened him. In fact, this story was invented \u2013 he simply lost the medal. He admitted years later: \u201cI don\u2019t know where I put that thing.\u201d Ali was issued with a replacement gold medal at half-time in the USA v Yugoslavia basketball game at the Atlanta Games in 1996. Ali had already made an impact in Atlanta. Shaking, trembling but still majestic, he took the Olympic torch from the swimmer Janet Evans and lit the flame at the opening ceremony. It is as enduring a memory from that Games as any achieved by an athlete.",

      "body": "<p>The moment that launched the career of the greatest athlete the world has ever known very nearly didn\u2019t happen. A fear of flying meant Cassius Clay tried to withdraw from the 1960 Olympic Games just weeks before the US team travelled to Rome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jun/09/classic-youtube-muhammad-ali-best-video-clips\">Muhammad Ali: career KOs, Candid Camera and his recipe for life | Classic YouTube</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 18-year-old from Louisville had been on planes before. He just didn\u2019t like them very much. A rocky flight to California for the Olympic trials cemented his view that, aside from when he was dancing in the ring, his feet should remain on the ground.</p> <p>In later years he became a master of disguising his fears (of Sonny Liston, George Foreman or Joe Frazier) but the teenage Clay had no qualms revealing he was scared. He asked if he could go to Rome by sea. He asked if he could make his way there by train. When told neither was possible he decided he could do without the Olympic Games. He was destined for greatness with or without a medal dangling from his neck.</p> <p>In the end it took a meeting with Joe Martin in Louisville\u2019s Central Park to convince him to travel. Martin was the policeman and boxing trainer who told a pepped-up 12-year-old that if he really wanted to deal with the thief who stole his bike, he should first learn how to fight.</p> <p>\u201cHe was afraid of flying,\u201d Martin told an HBO Muhammad Ali special. \u201cWe had a rough flight going to California for the trials and so when it came to go to Rome he said he wasn\u2019t gonna fly, and that he wouldn\u2019t go. I said: \u2018Well, you\u2019ll lose the opportunity of being a great fighter,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Well, I\u2019m not gonna go.\u2019 He wanted to take a boat or something. Anyway I finally took him out to Central Park here in Louisville and we had a long talk for a couple or three hours, and I calmed him down and convinced him if he wanted to be heavyweight champion of the world, then he had to go to Rome and win the Olympics.\u201d</p> <p>So Clay travelled to Rome by aeroplane. But he came prepared. Before departing he visited an army surplus store and purchased a parachute, which he kept strapped on throughout the flight. Accounts differ as to Clay\u2019s behaviour once the flight was airborne. In David Remnick\u2019s King of the World Joe Martin\u2019s son, Joe Jr, claims that during a rough flight Clay prayed in the aisle with the parachute on his back. Others recall Clay distracting himself from his fears by holding forth on the flight and decreeing who among the boxing team would win a gold medal. Obviously he included himself in this select group.</p> <p>Clay\u2019s credentials as an amateur boxer were there for all to see: 100 victories in 108 bouts, six Kentucky Golden Gloves championships, successive light-heavyweight National Amateur Athletic Union titles (1959 and 1960) and two Golden Gloves titles in a row (1959 and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_DASAHdyVk\">1960</a>).</p> <p>Before the Games, Sports Illustrated declared that he was the USA\u2019s best hope for a medal in boxing, but there was no real sense that a worldwide star was about to be unleashed. The only hype and fanfare came from Clay himself, but behind the brash statements was a training regime that was anything but amateur. Training began each day at 4am as he pounded his steel-toed work boots through the deadened streets of Louisville. John Powell, who worked at a liquor dispensary, told Sports Illustrated of the shadowy figure who came trudging the streets in the dead of night.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be sitting on the counter,\u201d Powell said, \u201cand I could see his shadow coming around the corner from Grand Avenue. Clay was on his way to Chicksaw Park. Cold, dark winter mornings. You could see that shadow coming. Then here he comes, running by, with those big old army brogans. He\u2019d be the onliest person in the early morning. And I\u2019d walk outside, and he\u2019d stop and shadowbox. He once said to me: \u2018Someday you\u2019ll own this liquor store and I\u2019ll be heavyweight champion of the world.\u2019 Both of those came true, too.\u201d</p> <p>But first there was Rome to deal with. There is a tendency to talk up the profound impact Clay had as he wandered the Olympic Village shaking as many hands as possible, like a politician on the campaign trail. There is a tendency to say everyone could see they were in the presence of greatness.</p> <p>In his book, Rome 1960: The Olympics That Changed the World, David Maraniss writes: \u201cIn retrospect, because of the worldwide fame he gained later as Muhammad Ali, there is a temptation to present him as a larger than life figure at the Rome Olympics than he really was. He was ebullient and memorable from the start, but he was not the leader of the US delegation. It was Clay seeking out people, not people seeking out Clay.\u201d</p> <p>Clay made an impact on the people he met and earned the nickname \u201cthe mayor of the Olympic Village\u201d. In his peerless biography of Muhammad Ali, Thomas Hauser recalls one unnamed team-mate saying: \u201cYou would have thought he was running for mayor. He went around introducing himself and learning other people\u2019s names and swapping team lapel pins. If they\u2019d had an election, he would have won in a walk.\u201d</p> <p>As he advanced through the rounds, Clay also became a favourite with the local crowds thanks to a style which, at that stage, was seen as highly unorthodox and, by many of boxing\u2019s old guard, as unnecessarily carefree.</p> <p>Clay\u2019s opening fight, against the Belgian Yvon Becaus, was stopped by the referee in the second round. He then beat the Russian Gennadiy Shatkov, who had won middleweight gold medal at the 1956 Games in Melbourne, in a unanimous points decision.</p> <p>In the semi-final Clay faced Australia\u2019s Tony Madigan. Again he triumphed in a unanimous decision but many observers felt Madigan was hard done by. A 2010 article in Louisville\u2019s Courier-Journal to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his gold medal has Bud Palmer, a CBS presenter, saying he felt that Clay had been beaten by the Australian.</p> <p>In the final Clay came up against <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0VelT6XGxY\">Zbigniew \u2018Ziggy\u2019 Pietrzykowski</a>, \u201ca portly coffeehouse keeper\u201d from Poland who was somewhere between 25 and 28, depending on whom you believe. The fight before the light-heavyweight final also pitched a Pole against one of the US team. Eddie Crook\u2019s victory over Tadeusz Walasek drew furious howls of derision from the crowd packed into the Palazzo della Sport.</p> <p>Their angry cries reached the dressing room, where Clay was in the final stages of his preparation. \u201cThe people made me fight harder than I should have,\u201d he told the Courier-Journal. \u201cWhen they booed five minutes after Crook\u2019s win and I was the next American in the ring, I knew I had to leave no doubts.\u201d</p> <p>Such was Clay\u2019s popularity that the crowd\u2019s mood seemed to change as soon as he came to the ring. But a resolution to leave no doubt in the mind of the audience and judges was one thing, but putting it into practice against the more experienced and physically stronger Pole was another, as the British journalist John Cottrell recalled:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cIn the first round, it seemed that Clay would be badly mauled. He was confused by his opponent\u2019s southpaw style, took some heavy punishment, and once showed his inexperience by closing his eyes in the face of a barrage of blows. Clay managed to keep out of trouble in the second round, and in the last minute he abandoned his show-off style with the fancy footwork and dropped hands, and stood his ground to throw four hard rights to the head. Even so, he was still behind on points at this stage. \u2018I knew,\u2019 he explained afterwards, \u2018that I had to take the third round big to win.\u2019<br><br>\u201cClay did finish big. In that final round he suddenly found his top form, moving in and out with expert judgment, punching crisply and with perfect timing. This sharper, better co-ordinated Clay stormed back with a torrent of combination punching which left Pietrzykowski dazed. He no longer relied too much on his left jab, but made equal use of his right to penetrate the southpaw\u2019s guard. Ripping into the stamina-lacking Pole, he drew blood and came preciously close to scoring a knockout. At the final bell, Pietrzykowski was slumped helplessly against the ropes. There was no doubting the verdict. All the judges made Clay the points winner.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The photograph which shows Clay receiving his medal can, in itself, be seen as a symbol of the changes that were about to take place not just in boxing, but in society as a whole. To Clay\u2019s left stands the bloodied Pietrzykowski, to his right the bronze medallists Giulio Saraudi and Madigan. They are wizened fighters of the old school.

      "bodyText": "Councils and other public bodies have reduced their use of temporary workers by 20% in the past two years, but figures reveal a more sophisticated use of non-permanent labour. The reduced usage of temporary staff identified in our government index report demonstrates that the public sector is gaining greater control of workforce expenditure through better planning, ensuring resources are spent in the right areas. We are also seeing good practice in new areas such as apprenticeship schemes, internal resourcing pools and the use of internal agencies. Despite the overall reduction in the use of temporary labour, there has been a marked increase in temporary workers being hired for specific projects, peak workload and other short-term demand situations from 40.9% at the start of 2010 to 45.2% at the end of 2011. There has also been a rise in the use of temporary workers aged over 45 from 20.5% to 23.1% over the past two years as councils seek experienced hands to help them in these tough times. The drive for greater efficiency and flexibility across public sector has however highlighted some challenges that need to be addressed, particularly in terms of long term workforce planning. The reduction of temporary workers has impacted women and the under-34s disproportionately to men and older workers. Two years ago, local authorities had an almost even split between men and women but now, the proportion of male and female workers has changed to 55.5% male and 44.5% female at the end of 2011. Younger workers are also feeling the effects of a reduction in temporary labour. As a percentage of the total, the largest decline is seen within the 25 to 34 age range, which has fallen from 32.9% to 27.6%. While not as severe, the 16 to 24 age range has also seen a decrease, from 12.2% to 11.3% of the total. This shows that the public sector is no less difficult than the private sector for school leavers and graduates to find employment. We believe this gap will widen in the short-term because of the large number of temporary workers employed in entry level social work, office/admin and light industrial roles, which typically are represented by a higher percentage of women and young people. In general councils are predominantly focused on taking steps to rein in expenditure. Some have already started to address these challenges through implementing apprenticeships schemes, utilising resourcing pools and developing internal agencies to develop the young and invest in them to fill future skills shortages. Such positive activity will no doubt ensure that workforce efficiency and flexibility is sustainable and not just a short term fix.

      "body": "<p>Councils and other public bodies have reduced their use of temporary workers by 20% in the past two years, but figures reveal a more sophisticated use of non-permanent labour.</p> <p>The reduced usage of temporary staff identified in our government index report demonstrates that the public sector is gaining greater control of workforce expenditure through better planning, ensuring resources are spent in the right areas. We are also seeing good practice in new areas such as apprenticeship schemes, internal resourcing pools and the use of internal agencies.</p> <p>Despite the overall reduction in the use of temporary labour, there has been a marked increase in temporary workers being hired for specific projects, peak workload and other short-term demand situations from 40.9% at the start of 2010 to 45.2% at the end of 2011.</p> <p>There has also been a rise in the use of temporary workers aged over 45 from 20.5% to 23.1% over the past two years as councils seek experienced hands to help them in these tough times.</p> <p>The drive for greater efficiency and flexibility across public sector has however highlighted some challenges that need to be addressed, particularly in terms of long term workforce planning. The reduction of temporary workers has impacted women and the under-34s disproportionately to men and older workers. Two years ago, local authorities had an almost even split between men and women but now, the proportion of male and female workers has changed to 55.5% male and 44.5% female at the end of 2011. Younger workers are also feeling the effects of a reduction in temporary labour. As a percentage of the total, the largest decline is seen within the 25 to 34 age range, which has fallen from 32.9% to 27.6%. While not as severe, the 16 to 24 age range has also seen a decrease, from 12.2% to 11.3% of the total. This shows that the public sector is no less difficult than the private sector for school leavers and graduates to find employment.</p> <p>We believe this gap will widen in the short-term because of the large number of temporary workers employed in entry level social work, office/admin and light industrial roles, which typically are represented by a higher percentage of women and young people.</p> <p>In general councils are predominantly focused on taking steps to rein in expenditure. Some have already started to address these challenges through implementing apprenticeships schemes, utilising resourcing pools and developing internal agencies to develop the young and invest in them to fill future skills shortages. Such positive activity will no doubt ensure that workforce efficiency and flexibility is sustainable and not just a short term fix.</p> <p><em>Jamie Horton is managing director of Comensura </em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

      "bodyText": "Paul Burston, author, long-time editor of Time Out's Gay and Lesbian pages, and founder/host of gay literary salon Polari is looking confidently to the future of the gay publishing world despite the industry being hit hard by the recession. Polari (a word to describe gay slang that was adopted during the time that same sex encounters were illegal and punishable by prison) began in November 2007 as a response to the distinct lack of celebration of gay novelists. Burston had published three novels and a number of non-fiction books but had not once received an invitation to read at a literary event. \"I was not the only gay writer in that position,\" says Burston. \"Then one day a fellow author and myself were discussing the lack of opportunities for us to promote our work, talking about how bookshops generally aren't keen to stock books by gay authors, let alone invite them along to a book signing,\" says Burston. \"The idea of Polari was born, and we have never looked back. I knew there was an appetite.\" Having just begun to DJ at London gay bar The Green Carnation, Burston told management, in his typically feisty fashion, that he would only continue to do so if they agreed to inviting an author to do a reading later in the evening. He got what he wanted but on the first night of Polari he was told to carry on playing music and not put the author on lest they lose customers. \"But we went ahead and it was great,\" laughs Burston. No-one seemed to miss the music.\" Polari soon outgrew the Green Carnation to other central London bars before being snapped up by the prestigious South Bank Centre. \"South Bank is very mixed. We have a far wider variety of folk, such as more straight women and a better age mix.\" A colourful figure, Burston often hosts Polari wearing the very top hat in which he posed naked (modesty intact by way of a strategically placed chair) for a gay magazine cover. \"I want to make the event fun and always dress up. Some people have an idea that a literary salon is boring and dry. Polari is anything but.\" Some of the many writers who have headlined include Will Self, Tariq Ali, Jake Arnott, Stella Duffy, Jonathan Kemp, James Maker and Molly Parkin. \"We have a good mix,\" says Burston. Male, female, straight, and gay. So long as they are writing about gay themes we will host them.\" Upcoming lesbian and gay literary talent is showcased at Polari as well as crowd-pullers. It has also featured as-yet unpublished authors. \"Writing a book is such an isolating experience. You need to be able to sell your work and get feedback from your peers as well as other potential readers.\" The atmosphere at Polari is fun, raucous and supportive of the writers. A number of well-established authors have named it as a favoured gig because the crowd is so warm and friendly. Burtson is always looking to provide variety. \"We get readings of old and revived classics as well as more fun slots such as the time we booked a naked poet and a ukulele player.\" Now attracting audiences of between 50 and 120 Polari is well established in the gay calendar. The March event, featuring best-selling author Patrick Gale is already sold out, and VG Lee, writer and stand-up comedian will read from her new novel, Always You, Edina in May. Burston is excited about the addition of the Polari prize for a first novel that is now in its second year as well as the possibility of adding other prizes, such as those celebrating particular genres. \"Square Peg Media is our new sponsor and provides really important support. We have the long list in July for the second Polari prize and are looking out for a corporate sponsor, so things are busy,\" says Burston, clearly excited about what the future holds for the gay literary community. \"Not all of us on the gay scene want a constant diet of loud Eurotrash blasting in our ears, or hanging around under a railway arch off your face on drugs. There are other ways to celebrate being gay.\" Content produced and controlled by Square Peg Media, supporter of the Diversity hub.",

Cynical commenters on the BBC's website claimed that perhaps the strategy is to win by cornering the \"middle-aged women vote from all across Europe\".

      "bodyText": "Local library staff are being trained to show customers how to access potentially life-changing advice and information online in a pilot scheme which could create a new national library service. Sixty libraries have been recruited to eight pilot projects looking at how libraries can direct library users to quality internet advice and information about finding a job, changing career or keeping healthy. Where a library user can go to discover online support about welfare benefits or personal finance is also being tested as part of the initiative set up by the Society of Chief Librarians (SCL) and funded by the Arts Council. The pilots, which focus on identifying high quality internet sites as well as developing the staff training package needed to deliver the service, are due to end at the end of March. The intention is that, following evaluation, they will provide the information and staff training material needed to deliver the new advice service in every library in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Brighton and Hove city council library service in East Sussex is one of two authorities testing how staff can help library users find advice about personal finance and welfare benefits. Brighton's head of libraries and information services Sally McMahon, who is also an executive committee member of the SCL says: \"By May we hope to have a report, with supporting staff training information, which can be used in every public library to help ordinary frontline staff guide the public on these kind of issues. \"We can't expect library staff to be trained up to Citizens' Advice Bureau level, however librarians have always had a strong information and advice role and this initiative will enable them to give good quality online advice and direct people to where they can find the knowledge they need.\" The pilots are the latest example of the growing role which libraries are playing in helping to reach the digitally excluded. According to the government's digital inclusion taskforce around 8.2 million people in Britain have never used the internet of whom 4 million are also socially excluded; more than a third of this group is out of work. In November 2010 the SCL signed up to the government's Race Online 2012 campaign which aims, by the end of that year, to make the UK the first country in the world where everybody can use the internet. The SCL pledged to support 500,000 to become digitally inclusive by the end of 2012. It hit its target within six months and to date libraries have helped around 1.5million people use the internet. Mark Taylor is chair of the SCL's digital group and head of libraries, arts and heritage for the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire. He believes libraries can successfully reach the digitally excluded because they offer an informal learning environment in accessible places. Staff are also trusted. He says: \"Libraries provide access to research and learning without any barriers. They are accessible places. Residents trust the public library and the people they see there who, generally speaking, are helpful.\" Library staff also have the skill to recognise good quality internet sites, he says. In 2001 lottery funding was made available to train all UK library staff in basic IT skills with many reaching the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) standard. \"It's a truism that anybody can look on the web but what I think public libraries still do is ensure access to quality-assured and verified information,\" Taylor says. Although cuts are hitting library services Taylor says staff training and development budgets for digital kills are surviving. \"In my authority we still have the same budget for digital training we had two years ago. We are using the skills of colleagues who are more advanced in the field, but we still put people on external courses because we felt it represents value for money.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "Last Wednesday Britain's best-read daily paper called on its 2.75 million readers to crack down on benefit fraud. Backed by the secretary of state for work and pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, the Sun's Beat the Cheat campaign encourages readers to be \"patriotic\" by reporting suspected cheats to the benefit fraud hotline. It builds on the almost daily stories in the press about people receiving \"disability benefits\" while taking part in sports or physically strenuous activities, which are stoking public anger. Benefit fraud is indeed a serious and costly issue for the UK \u2013 as the Sun trumpets, fraudulent claims cost the economy \u00a31.2bn a year. Yet, as someone who has been sworn at, spat at and intimidated by strangers in public, I know first-hand the ramifications of members of the public feeling they are qualified to make a judgement on disability. How many of the Sun's readers who have been left seething about those milking the system are actually fully armed with the facts about disabled claimants? First, not all disabled people use a wheelchair or a walking aid. A great proportion of us have hidden disabilities or, more fairly, disabilities that are not glaringly obvious. There are 70,000 people in the UK with muscular dystrophy or a related condition alone. I wonder how many people reading this article know about the more than 60 different types of genetic muscle-wasting and weakening conditions and how each affects people? How many have ever heard of my condition, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT)? I don't expect you to have. The average member of the public \u2013 or Sun journalist \u2013 is not a medical expert after all. CMT often shows no outward signs, but progressively causes the muscles in the limbs to weaken and waste over time, making it increasingly difficult to walk long distances, climb steps, keep balance and stay on foot for long periods of time. For those of us with conditions such as CMT who do not fit the visual stereotype of a \"disabled person\" constant scrutiny from the public of our disabilities is wearing and sometimes threatening. It is a strange burden to have to be conscious of strangers' perceptions of your disability, rather than concentrating on striving to live life to the full. The Sun's article \"exposes\" people who claim disability benefits dancing, playing golf and refereeing a football match. Yet disabled people do spend time out and about with friends and family. Disabled people do get involved in community activities, go to the gym, go out on the town with friends, go to university and get involved in clubs and groups. We as a society have aspired to break down the barriers that disability presents to living a full and active life. What is also missing from the Sun's article is an explanation of what \"disability benefits\" actually are. Much confusion exists around disability living allowance (DLA), which is not an income replacement benefit and is paid to eligible disabled people whether they are in work or not. DLA is designed to help disabled children and adults cover the additional living costs faced by those with a long-term illness or disability. Alongside personal care and specialist equipment, it helps people cover the many day-to-day costs that are caused by the country's infrastructure not being available to disabled people. For example, with a public transport system that is still not accessible to many, DLA helps cover the cost of using taxis or accessible vehicles. The benefit is paid at different rates and recipients must fit strict criteria verified by a health professional. Five of the nine \"cheats\" who feature in the Sun's launch article are claiming \"disability benefits\". Yet the rate of fraudulent claims for DLA is just 0.5% in comparison with jobseeker's allowance at 4.1%. Many individuals entitled to DLA do not claim it, due perhaps to pride or anxiety over the assessments required. This witch hunt against disabled people will no doubt put people off claiming the benefits that they are entitled to. Oversimplifying the issue of benefit fraud has brutal consequences. Confusion and suspicion is a dangerous thing for those of us on the receiving end. In December I was surrounded on a dark street, sworn at and spat at by a group of people who did not believe I was disabled, when I used my blue badge to park. A recent survey on disability hate crime by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign's Trailblazers, demonstrates that I am far from alone. Two-thirds of the young disabled people interviewed had been verbally abused, often because the perpetrators believed they were exaggerating or \"putting on\" their disabilities. A Trailblazer from Lancashire was almost pulled from her wheelchair by her hair by someone who did not believe she was disabled. If you are not a wheelchair user, using blue badges or taking seats on buses has become like a red flag to a bull. The majority of people on disability benefits are not scroungers and the rate of fraud remains relatively low. Hysterical media articles over benefit fraud that over-simplify the issue provoke frustrated, angry readers to take judgement into their own hands, and innocent disabled people are increasingly paying the price. As Britain's economic crisis continues, disabled people face more brutal judgements from \"experts\" within the government, local authorities and health leaders on our needs. Now, thanks to the country's leading newspaper, the public has been appointed for the role of judge and jury, too. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "As a measure of calm returned to the market after Tuesday's sell-off, mining and banking shares were among the leading risers. HSBC added 4.8p to 553.2p as it agreed to sell its general insurance business in Hong Kong, Singapore, Argentina and Mexico to France's Axa and Australia's QBE for $914m in cash. The move is part of the bank's strategy to sell non-core operations. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said: Based on the disclosed net asset value of $237m, the implied exit multiple is 3.9 times, which appears to be a relatively healthy valuation, in our view. The transaction is not unexpected, having been subject to recent press speculation. Nor is it particularly material to the group finances, in our view. However, it represents a further step in the company's strategy to build a more focused business, being the 20th such disposal or business closure (by our maths) that the company has announced since its strategy day last May. In addition, HSBC and Hang Seng Bank have agreed to sign 10 year bancassurance distribution deals with Axa and QBE, which will result in commissions on product sales and, potentially, profit-related payments being made to HSBC and Hang Seng. Still with insurance, motor specialist Admiral has jumped 117p to \u00a311.57 after its profits rose by a better than expected 13%. In November the company warned it had been hit by a rise in personal injury claims, causing analysts to slash their forecasts. Chief executive Henry Engelhardt said: It has been a disappointing year. Not because it was a bad year, but because so much more was expected. (It's worth having a look at his chief executive's statement in full, by the way, with its references to Dickens, Superman and chameleons among other things.) But a number of analysts are still cautious on the company. Kevin Ryan at Investec said: As the 2011 results demonstrate, Admiral remains significantly more profitable than the rest of the UK motor market. We believe that as Admiral grows and its competitors take remedial action to address losses, this leadership position will be eroded. We retain our 570p target price and sell recommendation. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 8.83 points at 5774.63, as investors hold their nerve ahead of the deadline for Greece to finalise its bond swap. After Tuesday's downbeat note on the cigarette sector from Investec, British American Tobacco is leading the fallers, down 93p at 3098.5p. However the bulk of the decline is due to its shares going ex-dividend. Indeed, the six companies being quoted without the shareholder payout would knock 11 points off the FTSE 100 if they all fell in line with the dividend figure. These include CRH, down 15p to \u00a312.70, and Serco, off 1p at 518p. Elsewhere Cairn Energy is down 4.2p at 316.8p as it heads out of the FTSE 100.",

      "bodyText": "Scientists at the Tevatron particle collider in the US have found the strongest evidence yet for the existence of the Higgs boson. Their results lend credence to the tentative glimpses of the subatomic particle reported at the end of last year by scientists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern in Geneva \u2013 suggesting that the particle is indeed real. Tevatron scientists, based at Fermilab in Chicago, announced their results on Wednesday at the annual Rencontres de Moriond conference in La Thuile, Italy. They found evidence for a new fundamental particle that has a mass of around 120 GeV, which fits with the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics for the Higgs boson and is similar to experimental evidence announced by LHC scientists in December. The Tevatron's results are the swansong for the particle accelerator, which finished colliding particles in September last year. Until the LHC was switched on in 2008, the Tevatron was the most powerful collider in the world and, in its final years of operation, raced to catch a glimpse of the Higgs boson. The Higgs particle is postulated by physicists as part of the mechanism by which all other fundamental particles acquire mass. The theory behind it was published by six physicists \u2013 including Edinburgh University physicist Peter Higgs \u2013 within a few months of each other in 1964. In their search for the particle, scientists at the LHC announced results in December from particle collisions at the Atlas and CMS detectors. One team reported a \"bump\" in their data that could have been a Higgs boson weighing 126GeV, with a significance of 2.3 \"sigma\" (the scale used by particle physicists to grade the significance of results, from one to five, with five being enough to claim an official discovery). A second team reported a 1.9 sigma Higgs signal at a mass of around 124GeV. Wednesday's announcement by Tevatron scientists combined data from the two main detectors at the particle accelerator, D0 and CDF. The scientists there found an excess of signals between 115GeV and 135GeV, at a significance of 2.2 sigma. Stefan S\u00f6ldner-Rembold of the University of Manchester, who works on the D0 experiment, told the Guardian that the result was \"significant\", though a formal discovery would require a much higher sigma level. \"What it says is that it's very difficult to remain a sceptic at this point,\" said S\u00f6ldner-Rembold. \"Everything points in the same direction and it is really really hard to believe it's not there.\" One reason the Tevatron results are important is that the detectors there look for the Higgs in a different way to the detectors at the LHC. In the LHC's announcement in December, scientists had largely been looking for a signal in which the Higgs boson decayed into a pair of photons, whereas the Tevatron located its signal in the decay of the boson into a pair of heavy \"bottom\" quarks. \"The Higgs particle can decay into different particles and the Tevatron looks for different decays of the Higgs than the LHC,\" said S\u00f6ldner-Rembold. \"If it's really there, the hints from the LHC would also be seen at the Tevatron at an independent machine and in a machine where the Higgs particle is looked for in a different decay. That all gives more credence to these hints.\" Not everyone is convinced, however. \"The 'Higgsteria' surrounding the excess of [bottom] quarks in the Tevatron is certainly suggestive of a Higgs but we could still just be seeing the cruel hand of statistical fluctuations or better still the indications of something unexpected and more prosaic than the Higgs,\" said Mark Lancaster, a physicist at University College London who works on the Tevatron's CDF experiment. He said the Higgs mechanism was only one solution to the question of how fundamental particles get their mass. Mass could also be a result of the interactions predicted by a theory called technicolour, which proposes the existence of different, as yet undiscovered particles, and not the Higgs boson. The observed results may be down to random fluctuations or a systematic error in the way the Tevatron detectors model and interpret the particle collisions, said S\u00f6ldner-Rembold, but many factors would have had to \"come together and conspire in a very strange way\". \"There's so many hints from the LHC and the Tevatron, they all point in the same direction,\" he said. \"Unless there's some conspiracy going on in nature, it all looks like it's the Higgs boson.\" The LHC will need to gather much more data over the coming months and years before scientists are able to confirm the discovery of the Higgs boson. Even if that happens, there will be a lot of further work characterising the properties of the particle. \"If you discover there is some particle at 120GeV, to be absolutely sure it is the Standard Model Higgs which we think it is, one would have to measure precisely how it is produced and how it decays to determine its properties,\" said S\u00f6ldner-Rembold. \"That's quite a way down the road because, for that, you need much more data. There still remains quite a bit of work to be done to be absolutely sure that it is actually the Higgs boson as the Standard Model predicts it.\"",

I hope the course left you inspired and invigorated, filled with new skills and knowledge. But there's also another significant possibility.

The course may have been terrible/boring/poorly facilitated/inappropriate. Tick any which applies. Or it may have been thoroughly enjoyable and a great means of meeting new people and networking. But answer this question: Did that course actually change the way you do your job? If the answer is usually \"Yes, and in a good way\" then great. But if it's \"No, it was rubbish\" or even \"No. But it was quite interesting\" then perhaps we need to be thinking about ways and means of delivering training that is both value for money, and effective. Ask any group of health and social care staff how to resolve a particular issue and the probability is that a request for more training will loom very large in the responses, as they often do following independent inquiries. More training so often seems to be the panacea to all the ills of health and social care work, but is there an evidence base to suggest throwing a few workshops at failures in adult protection is the path to practice redemption? No. At least not according to a PhD student Lindsey Pike. Pike's doctoral thesis explores the remarkably under-researched question of how training actually impacts practice at the frontline of care and support, specifically focusing on safeguarding adults training in one particular county. Her findings are telling. Pike's work shows that lots of resources, effort and administration are being ploughed into costly training which doesn't, at the end of the day, result in improvements in safeguarding skills on the shop floor \u2013 unless training is embedded in a positive training culture and transfer climate. Transfer climate refers to \"those situations and consequences in organisations that either inhibit or facilitate the use of what has been learned in training back on the job\". A positive transfer climate would be one where delegates attend relevant, timely training, with a clear idea of what they need to gain from it. Myself and others from both the UK and further afield are starting to think about a move on from the \"coffee, biscuits, Powerpoint\" model, which ticks the box on a manager's to-do list but achieves little else in terms of making us better at our jobs or providing better services. So what's the answer? I suggest that traditional classroom-based training can be worth so much more when combined with three key features. Firstly, tightly-knit integration of the one- or two-day course with an organisation's own policies and procedures, client groups and focus of attention. Secondly, training could and should be followed up by some form of one-to-one or small group meeting to allow participants to establish whether the course made an impact on their practice. And who should be doing this follow-up? Preferably the trainer who delivered the course. But what if the trainer is now hundreds of miles away? Skype or one of the many e-learning packages can be utilised. But there is an even better solution. Localised training delivered by local practitioners who have been given skills by a competent, focused training package is, I think, a genuine and realistic alternative to the expert from afar model. Delivering good training is a considerable skill, but not so much a considerable skill it can't be learned, especially when training skills are backed up by the sort of expertise and experience in health and social care so valued by course participants.

      "bodyText": "He appears in Downton Abbey, one of a wave of TV dramas centred on class, and in the Radio Times this week the actor Rob James-Collier was asked whether working-class talent was being squeezed out of the profession. James-Collier was born in Stockport, and defines himself as working class, and his answer was direct. As with so many other jobs at the moment, he said, you have to work for no money when starting out, and \"how on earth are you going to finance that\" if you don't come from a wealthy background? His comments tapped into a question that has arisen repeatedly this year. Can anyone but the exceptionally well-heeled, wealthy, connected upper classes now make it in the arts? In acting, in particular, the question was thrown into sharp relief in January, when the shortlist for the Bafta rising star award was announced. The list was remarkable for two reasons. All five nominees were men, and two were contemporaries at one school. Tom Hiddleston and Eddie Redmayne are both old Etonians, and their nomination led to articles highlighting just how their schoolmates are dominating our stages and screens. There's Harry Lloyd, who starred in Great Expectations and The Iron Lady; Harry Hadden-Paton, currently in She Stoops to Conquer at the National Theatre; Damian Lewis, appearing in the hit TV drama Homeland; and Dominic West, star of The Wire and The Hour. That's not to mention Benedict Cumberbatch, who went to Harrow, and Henry Cavill, star of the latest Superman film, who went to Stowe. Their success raises these issues. Do you need family wealth in order to become an actor? And is there currently a bias towards a certain class in casting? (Are we, to put it simply, buried deep in an era of floppy-fringed costume drama?) The cost of acting training has long seemed impossibly high, but the introduction of fees at universities in much of the UK might actually make it seem slightly more affordable \u2013 not because the situation has improved for acting students, but because it is just so bleak for almost everybody. Vicky Taylor, marketing and communications manager at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London, says it costs \u00a39,000 a year for its three-year BA, and \u00a310,000 a year for its MA, but stresses that admission is purely on the basis of talent. There are 3,000 applicants for 28 places each year on the BA, and she says the best get in, regardless of wealth \u2013 a system of bursaries and scholarships cover training if an applicant can't afford it. \"What we strive for,\" she says, \"is to train talent and that is the overarching factor for anyone who applies and gets in. You don't have to have had experience. You don't have to have gone to a stage school on a Saturday [during your teens] that you've had to pay for. We audition every single person who applies.\" Around 57% of Rada's students receive some form of scholarship or bursary fund, she says, and more than a third come from households with a parental income of less than \u00a325,000. Anna Faulkner, communications and events manager at the Central School of Speech &amp; Drama, also in London, says one of the factors that influences applicants is \"whether their secondary school embraces the teaching of performing arts\". Central holds performing arts workshops in secondary schools in \"lower-participation\" areas, she says, which sounds like a great scheme, and apparently broadens interest around the UK. But even the best schemes are unlikely to be able to compete with the environment at Eton, where the drama department includes a full-time designer, a carpenter, a manager, a part-time wardrobe mistress and a director-in-residence. In the first two months of this year, the school has staged productions of The Cripple of Inishmaan, Attempts on Her Life, The Front Page and The History Boys. Even if the costs of acting training are covered, the outlook for actors after university is generally tough unless they have a lot of luck, or splendid connections. A few decades back, says Martin Brown, assistant general secretary of the actors' union Equity, there was the possibility of joining a repertory company \"that would work at one theatre over a period of six months, sometimes even longer, doing a whole range of productions. Someone coming out of a college such as Rada in those days could reasonably hope to get a job working in a small part, hone their skills, get some income, and that gave them their first footing in the industry. That virtually doesn't exist any more, so people are much more vulnerable. So yes, of course, private income, private wealth, would help enormously to survive.\" Andrew Glen, an actor in his late 20s, came out of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow with debts, and has worked a variety of jobs to get by since \u2013 but he sees this experience as highly positive. \"I've actually said in letters to casting directors recently that I've done everything from being a bus conductor to working in a factory, being a waiter, and you can draw on all those things. Your next part could be as a person working in a chicken factory, so I think it's enhanced my acting, in a way.\" This echoes James-Collier's comment that \"because you've done the horrible jobs it gives you an even grittier determination to succeed. If I had a comfort blanket, I wouldn't have been as passionate and driven. It takes away that determination and then, when you get there, you really do appreciate it because you know where you have been.\" \"I don't think it would make you a better actor if you came from a wealthy background and sat on your arse all day waiting for your agent to get you a job,\" says Glen. \"I think it's better to be interacting with people. Because in the acting profession, that's what it's all about. It's about reacting to whatever circumstance you're in.\" It is also about stamina and self belief, and it is in this last quality particularly that a wealthy background perhaps helps. \"You need drive, you need courage, you need bravery,\" says Brown. \"You've got to have that self-belief to keep going. Actors, even well-known actors, go to auditions, castings, meetings, and are constantly told: 'No thanks, not you.' Getting turned down is absolutely part of the warp and weft of their lives, so you've got to have that bravery and belief in yourself, and that commitment to keep going.\" All kinds of people have these qualities, of course, but they are exactly the sort of characteristics that a public-school education is expected to imbue. I ask Gareth McLean, a TV critic at the Radio Times, who interviewed James-Collier, whether we are in an era of distinctly upper-class drama, a wave of period pieces that an Old Etonian might be particularly well suited to. (All actors want to avoid typecasting, but it goes on. Last year Cumberbatch said as \"a posh actor in England, you can't escape class-typing, from whatever side you look at it. I realised quite early on that, although I wasn't trying to make a career speciality of it, I was playing slightly asexual, sociopathic intellectuals\".) McLean says the real problem is how rare it is to see working-class lives on TV. In the past, he says, \"there were programmes such as Clocking Off, Auf Wiedersehen Pet and Boys from the Black Stuff, and where are those shows now? The only time you see working-class life on TV is when they go back to people's houses on The X Factor or Britain's Got Talent.\" Brown emphasises that \"actors still come from a whole range of social backgrounds, and some of them with enormous talent\" And it is true that the Bafta rising star award eventually went to Adam Deacon, who said the prize was \"a win for the underdog\". It is also true that a wealthy background probably makes it easier to thrive in this risky business. When it comes to that, nothing changes.",

      "bodyText": "You don't need the Mill to tell you that these are troubled economic times. One in five people who left university within the past two years is out of work, according to the Office for National Statistics, and unemployment is at its highest since 1995. But fear not, because the economic secretary to the Treasury, Chloe Smith, says \"there are jobs out there\". They're taking applications for one at Stamford Bridge this very second. The good news for any readers fancying themselves as Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's long-term replacement at Chelsea is that Harry Redknapp won't be applying. \"I wouldn't be able to come back to north London,\" exclaimed the man who took a year-long sabbatical from coaching Portsmouth to decide if he preferred life with Pompey's good friends at Southampton. One man who could be getting the job, according to the Daily Mail, is the Germany coach Joachim L\u00f6w, who has sensationally failed to rule himself out of the running.

      "bodyText": "The world's most notorious computer hacker has been working as an informer for the FBI for at least the last six months, it emerged on Tuesday, providing information that has helped contribute to the charging of five others, including two Britons, for computer hacking offences. Hector Xavier Monsegur, an unemployed 28-year-old Puerto Rican living in New York, was unmasked as \"Sabu\", the leader of the LulzSec hacking group that has been behind a wave of cyber raids against American corporations including Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the intelligence consultancy Stratfor, British and American law enforcement bodies, and the Irish political party Fine Gael. It was revealed that he had been charged with 12 criminal counts of conspiracy to engage in computer hacking and other crimes last summer, crimes which carry a maximum sentence of 124 years and six months in prison. According to indictments filed in a Manhattan federal court, he secretly pleaded guilty on 15 August last year. Despite that, Sabu carried on with his aggressive online persona as the LulzSec \"leader\", with the father of two going so far as to deny online \u2013 the day after his secret guilty plea \u2013 that he had \"snitched\" on his friends. His online \"hacker\" activity continued until very recently, with a tweet sent by him in the last 24 hours saying: \"The feds at this moment are scouring our lives without warrants. Without judges approval. This needs to change. Asap.\" In a US court document, the FBI's informant \u2013 there described as CW \u2013 \"acting under the direction of the FBI\" helped facilitate the publication of what was thought to be an embarrassing leak of conference call between the FBI and the UK's Serious and Organised Crime Agency in February. Officers from both sides of the Atlantic were heard discussing the progress of various hacking investigations in the call. A second document shows that Monsegur \u2013 styled this time as CW-1 \u2013 provided an FBI-owned computer to facilitate the release of 5m emails taken from US security consultancy Stratfor and which are now being published by WikiLeaks. That suggests the FBI may have had an inside track on discussions between Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, and Anonymous, another hacking group, about the leaking of thousands of confidential emails and documents. The indictments mark the most significant strike by law enforcement officials against the amateur hacker groups that have sprung out of Anonymous. These groups, which include LulzSec, have cost businesses millions of pounds and exposed the credit card details and passwords of nearly 1 million people. An FBI official told Fox News, which broke the story: \"This is devastating to the organisation \u2026 we're chopping off the head of LulzSec.\" But Graham Cluley, a consultant with the security company Sophos, warned news of the arrests, and of Monsegur's betrayal, could trigger a wave of fresh attacks by furious hackers. \"There are plenty of Anonymous sympathisers out there who will continue to steal information and pass it to Anonymous and WikiLeaks. LulzSec were more sophisticated than most, knew more about computer hacking. But that doesn't mean that there aren't others out there with those skills too.\" The five charged by US authorities on Tuesday \u2013 two in the UK, two in Ireland and one in Chicago \u2013 amounted to a sweep of names who are alleged to have carried out all of the most public hacking attacks in the past year. One of the people named in the indictment, Jake Davis, already faces a number of charges in the UK relating to alleged hacking by LulzSec. Davis, of Lerwick, Shetland, was on Tuesday charged in the US with two counts of computer hacking conspiracy. Ryan Ackroyd \u2013 a 25-year-old from Doncaster who is said to have used the names \"kayla\", \"lol\" and \"lolspoon\" \u2013 was also charged on two counts of alleged computer hacking conspiracy. A statement from the US Attorney's office in New York said that Ackroyd was being interviewed on Tuesday by the Metropolitan police. Each count of computer hacking conspiracy carries a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. Scotland Yard is also running parallel inquiries. One inquiry involves Ackroyd, Jake Davis, and two other people including a 17-year-old boy in connection with their alleged activities within LulzSec. Ackroyd was charged in the UK on Tuesday night with two counts of conspiracy to \"do an unauthorised act with intent to impair or with recklessness impairing of an operation of a computer\", police said. The 17-year-old boy has been charged with two computer conspiracy offences. It is understood that it is unlikely anyone would be extradited before UK trials had concluded. Four people have now been charged by Scotland Yard in connection with hacking into a number of websites including that of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. LulzSec was a hacker \"crew\" of about 10 people whose infamous run began with an attack in May 2011 on the Fox.com site, and then on the US X-Factor competition for which they released passwords and profiles of 73,000 contestants. It quickly escalated to an attack against Sony Pictures, followed by a security company and a number of online games companies. But their downfall came after they hacked into InfraGard, a non-profit organisation affiliated with the FBI, and then attacked the websites of the CIA, the US Congress and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency. LulzSec's existing members began to worry about government retribution. Although they hacked into the News International systems on 18 July, changing the front page of The Sun's website, the police and other hackers were on their tail. One called The Jester \u2013 believed to be a former member of the US military \u2013 who normally attacks jihadist websites, suggested on 24 June that Sabu was an IT consultant based in New York. The two Irish individuals charged are Darren Martyn, 25, of Galway, Ireland, on two charges of computer hacking conspiracy, Donncha O'Cearrbhail, 19, of Birr, Ireland, on one charge of computer hacking conspiracy and one charge of unlawfully intercepted wire communication, which carries a sentence of up to five years. O'Cearrbhail was arrested by Irish police on Tuesday. The fifth person charged is Jeremy Hammond, 27, of Chicago, US, who was arrested and charged on Monday for alleged offences relating to the December 2011 hacking of global intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting. He is charged with one count of computer hacking conspiracy, one count of computer hacking, and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud.",

      "bodyText": "\"So \u2013 if these health reforms go through, should we work with them or against them?\" came an entreaty on Twitter from a trainee GP who is asking the question the coalition should fear most. As the NHS bill apparently reaches its final parliamentary stages, the government seems to be of the view that once the royal assent is granted, the political and professional furore will die down and the small print of implementation can be safely consigned to guidance and secondary legislation. This suggests a degree of naivety that could be corrected by any student of policy implementation. What we are more likely to see is three types of ongoing resistance. The first is explicit political resistance. The NHS is one of the few areas of policy where the public routinely ranks the Labour party as more trusted than other parties, and Ed Miliband will doubtless be ruthless in blaming every unpopular decision about healthcare on the coalition's legislation, rightly or wrongly. The party has run an effective campaign of opposition to the changes, but paradoxically has most to gain politically from them going ahead. The opposition will surely not miss an open goal and, wisely or not, Andy Burnham is already promising some form of repeal should Labour regain power. Politically, resistance will run and run. Secondly, there may well be ongoing professional resistance. It is hard to imagine that all of the professional groups who have formally opposed the bill in its entirety will simply down their placards and put the legislation into effect. We have 40 years of evidence that shows policy implementation is as much \"bottom-up\" as \"top-down\", and we know that through the implementation process it is possible to effectively rewrite top-down intentions. This is especially so in medicine and healthcare where some exercise of discretionary professional judgment is inescapable. GPs, in particular, will not lightly abandon their professional judgment to commissioning support units, referral panels or other attempts at performance management by their CCGs or the NHS commissioning board. Both overt and covert professional resistance will probably be endemic. There is a final form of resistance that has probably yet to be articulated \u2013 it could be termed system resistance. The changes have been sold as a radical dose of decentralisation \u2013 local GPs to become commissioners of healthcare, local HealthWatch bodies to look after patient interests, local foundation trusts with greater freedoms and new roles for local government through health and wellbeing boards. Moreover, as a concessionary afterthought, Andrew Lansley has made some genuflection towards integrated care and public involvement as a counterweight to the competitive thrust of the reforms. In reality these measures are meant to be of much less significance than the centralising powers of the NHS commissioning board and the new roles for Monitor in setting up a market in healthcare, but in the right circumstances they could be the entree for local resistance to market encroachment. This would require several things to be in place: \u2022 A high level of trust between local and sub-regional stakeholders \u2013 the most difficult yet indispensable first step; \u2022 A shared understanding that without system-wide commitments to service planning and integration the healthcare system could easily fragment; \u2022 Acknowledgement that the three outcomes frameworks (on the NHS, public health and adult social care) overlap and need joint action if they are to be met; \u2022 A willingness to join together in larger configurations to ensure commissioning support arrangements can be decided locally rather than falling into the hands of large private consultancies; \u2022 Utilising the opportunities offered by the health and wellbeing boards, joint strategic needs assessments and joint health and wellbeing strategies to breathe new life into local service planning; \u2022 Serious adoption of the legislative obligations to promote integration and engage with patients and the public; \u2022 Bringing together NHS commissioners and providers in localities and sub-regions, rather than reifying the purchaser-provider split. What this system-wide partnering could achieve is potentially immense. First it offers an alternative route to safe and appropriate service reconfiguration \u2013 a locally planned system rather than bringing in Monitor to decide on a \"failure regime\". Second, by involving all local partners (including the third sector and the harnessing of social capital) it makes the strategic goal of care closer to home more of a reality. Thirdly, it breathes genuine localism into our stiflingly centralised system. And finally it makes it somewhat easier to make financial savings without sacrificing quality. They think it's all over \u2026 it's barely started! Bob Hudson is a professor in the school of applied social sciences at University of Durham This article is published by Guardian Professional.

This would require several things to be in place:</p> <p>\u2022 A high level of trust between local and sub-regional stakeholders \u2013 the most difficult yet indispensable first step;</p> <p>\u2022 A shared understanding that without system-wide commitments to service planning and integration the healthcare system could easily fragment;</p> <p>\u2022 Acknowledgement that the three outcomes frameworks (on the NHS, public health and adult social care) overlap and need joint action if they are to be met;</p> <p>\u2022 A willingness to join together in larger configurations to ensure commissioning support arrangements can be decided locally rather than falling into the hands of large private consultancies;</p> <p>\u2022 Utilising the opportunities offered by the health and wellbeing boards, joint strategic needs assessments and joint health and wellbeing strategies to breathe new life into local service planning;</p> <p>\u2022 Serious adoption of the legislative obligations to promote integration and engage with patients and the public;</p> <p>\u2022 Bringing together NHS commissioners and providers in localities and sub-regions, rather than reifying the purchaser-provider split.</p> <p>What this system-wide partnering could achieve is potentially immense. First it offers an alternative route to safe and appropriate service reconfiguration \u2013 a locally planned system rather than bringing in Monitor to decide on a \"failure regime\". Second, by involving all local partners (including the third sector and the harnessing of social capital) it makes the strategic goal of care closer to home more of a reality. Thirdly, it breathes genuine localism into our stiflingly centralised system. And finally it makes it somewhat easier to make financial savings without sacrificing quality.</p> <p>They think it's all over \u2026 it's barely started!</p> <p><em>Bob Hudson is a professor in the school of applied social sciences at University of Durham</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

The afternoon I spent with him talking about books, writing and life \u2013 the interview was supposed to last an hour, and I stayed for six \u2013 has remained with me ever since. It was an experience of surpassing strangeness, and one which left me changed. Just like reading one of his books, in fact. Being a diligent reviewer, when I knew I'd be writing this piece I dug out my ancient copies of his books \u2013 The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz, Riddley Walker, The Mouse and his Child, the Frances stories I read to my children. I also trawled the tributes and obituaries published after he died late last year, and that word \"strangeness\" cropped up in most. One commentator went so far as to describe him as \"the strangest writer in Britain\", which is pretty good-going for a country that has produced JG Ballard and Mervyn Peake. It's hardly surprising, therefore, that Hoban long ago acquired cult status, strangeness often being the main qualification. But Will Self has said that he found Hoban in person to be \"wry, gentle and wise\", and those are the very words I'd use to describe his second-to-last book Soonchild (a picture book is due out from Walker in the autumn, and the RSC is staging a play based on The Mouse and His Child). Mind you, it's pretty strange too. The story is set in \"The North\", a place which might, or might not, bear some similarity to the regions where the Inuit live. Its hero is Sixteen-Face John, a shaman who neglects his spiritual duties and spends his time drinking Coke and reading the kind of magazines that have centrefolds. John's wife is pregnant, but the baby \u2013 the brilliantly named \"Soonchild\" of the title \u2013 refuses to emerge from the womb because it can't hear the \"World Songs\", the music that tempts all children to be born. So John has to set out on a quest to put things right. Such a bald description of the plot does little to convey the story's timeless quality. Ignore the references to Coke and magazines, and you could be reading an Inuit legend, shot full of wryness and wit and with deep insight into human nature. Like all of us, John is full of fears and anxieties, and acquired his name because he had \"sixteen different faces for looking at what scared him\". The passage in which these are listed in order of escalation is a virtuoso piece of comic writing. Walker are also to be congratulated on producing such a beautiful physical object, with a fine dustjacket, fully illustrated boards and different coloured paper to represent different parts of the narrative, and all for under a tenner. Alexis Deacon's moody pencil illustrations add a haunting counterpoint to the magical realism of the story, and have their own moments of wit. One question looms large, of course: is it a children's book? The themes \u2013 birth, death, spiritual regeneration \u2013 might lead you to think otherwise, but that would be a mistake. Hoban himself said several times that all his work is about looking at the world and finding it strange. That's what children and young people do, and what the best books do for them. Every adolescent should have a copy of this one. Trust me, nobody will be writing stories quite like this any more. \u2022 Tony Bradman's Sam and Ruby's Olympic Adventure is published by Barrington Stoke.",

      "bodyText": "We can understand a great deal more about new Islamic groups if we approach at least some of them as new religious movements. Their beliefs and practices can find appeal among some, predominantly young, people not only because they are Islamic but also because they are new and provide a basis for creating alternative space for social experimentation and efforts at social change. These groups generate social tensions and even conflicts. But they do not do so on their own. The reaction of a wider society is a large part of the story. And while these tensions and conflicts can lead to violence, they don't necessarily do so. My research on the New Muslims movement in the northern Caucasus illustrates these points. This \"radical\" movement appeared in the early 1990s in a small republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, a region beset by a near-collapsing economy and suffering the repercussions of armed conflicts in neighbouring Chechnya and tensions elsewhere in the northern Caucasus. Compared with non-members, however, the New Muslims tended to be better educated and aspiring to take advantage of the new social, economic and political freedoms of the post-Soviet 1990s \u2013 yet at the same time shackled by clan-based and highly restrictive social relationships replete with bribery and tight subordination, not least of younger people. The existing \"old\" Islamic institutions in the region held little appeal for the young. Communities of the New Muslims \u2013 the jamaats \u2013 on the other hand, provided a range of opportunities for these young people: in business (all members were employed), in social status (holding positions of responsibility in the jamaats), and in personal life (jamaats were drug and alcohol free). What was new about the Islam of the New Muslims was its Salafi orientation. It was radical in the sense that it provided authoritative justifications for challenging the existing social order. In an apparent paradox, the New Muslims' \"return\" to what they saw as a pure, Salafi Islam was in many ways an attempt to modernise social practices and create an alternative social space for what they themselves would call \"halal life\" and what I would call \"social experimentation\". An emergence of any new religious group means a construction of a new \"us\" versus an existing \"them\", and tensions are likely to occur. So the New Muslims refused to participate in many traditional activities that their parents and grandparents saw as central to their existence as a community. However, these tensions did not have to spill over into violence. Indeed, after 1998, the New Muslims' leaders became increasingly concerned about the movement's legitimacy and made efforts to oppose militant versions of Islamism, such as Takfiri ideas. Demographic changes were doing their work, too: the New Muslims were growing older; many of them were getting families and accepting all the responsibilities that came with this. So what leads some from these largely peaceful reformist movements to become violent? We understand this better if we reflect on how actions by both new groups and their opponents, including state agencies, can contribute to either escalating or aborting a spiral of violence. In the case of the New Muslims, there was an increasing polarisation between the movement and its opponents, with each framing the other as \"false Muslims\". However, even this framing did not have to spill over into violence had not the labels applied to the New Muslims by the mass media and government agencies (such as Salafi, Wahhabi and Islamist) not become associated with violence in the region where terrorist groups had already been operating and attempting to co-opt New Muslims into their ranks. As a result, indiscriminate violence started to be used by law-enforcement agencies to curb the movement (including torture, imprisonment without trial, desecration and closure of mosques). The local terrorist groups and Chechen rebels used this further to pressure the New Muslims to join a pan-Caucasian jihad against the Russian \"infidel\" as the common enemy. In turn, the law-enforcement agencies responded with ever escalating violence, driving the movement's leadership ever closer to joining the terrorist jihadists. And so it happened that some New Muslims became both the victims and perpetrators of violence. While based on research in the more politically restrictive environment of the northern Caucasus, it shows how treating people with radical and even antisocial views who are nevertheless operating within the law as potential terrorists can easily lead to real terrorists increasing their pool of recruits. Liberal democracy should use its rich repertoire of solutions capable of accommodating those who peacefully disagree with its foundations to cope with such young people, and by doing this make itself more appealing to them as they grow and mature. \u2022 Marat Shterin will be presenting new research into anti-extremism policy at the third of the Westminster Faith Debates, organised by the AHRC Religion and Society Programme, Theos and Charles Clarke on Wednesday 7 March 2012",

      "bodyText": "It's been described as the \"North Sea oil strategy\" by our local press. And it's certainly making an impression, with the echo of lively public meetings still ringing in my ears. Introducing our new community investment programme was never going to be easy because, fundamentally, it is a plan B. Facing more than \u00a3200m in capital funding cuts from government for schools, plus a housing repairs bill that nearly doubles that, we're not going to be able to solve all our problems \u2013 and there will be some tough decisions over those we can solve. We're in a relatively unique position in Camden: in the 1970s the council bought a large portfolio of land across the borough. Despite the economic climate, our inner-London location means property prices continue to rise steadily. However, with responsibility as landlord comes a hefty maintenance bill plus many buildings now at the end of their natural lives. We are using this as a positive opportunity to look across the council's portfolio and consider how we can release some of the value of these old buildings and underused land, to reinvest into upgrading our housing stock (which we manage in-house) and community facilities. It will also allow us to create one of the biggest social housing building programmes in the capital with more than 850 new council rent or shared ownership homes planned to be built. Selling off the family silver? No: we will be selling a smaller percentage of our stock than we redevelop, and we will be able to make some big changes to our neighbourhoods. This includes investing \u00a3119m into housing repairs and \u00a3117m for our schools and children's centres. But crucially the assets for sale are not council homes. One of our key aims is to build more social housing and tackle some of the inequality we know exists in areas with poor quality housing. We are already delivering the first schemes so we know it works. It won't all happen overnight. This is a 15-year programme with more than 80 projects in the first phase and more sites to be identified. It's crucial we genuinely work with local communities. That's not shorthand for meaningless consultations. It means real examples where local people have been involved in design workshops, on panels to appoint architects and setting up new community bodies to take part in creating their new homes and community facilities. It's by no means plain sailing. On some schemes, in order to rebuild community facilities like a school and release cash to fund repairs to existing council homes, we may have to adopt less than a 50:50 split of affordable to private housing to fund the development. Other projects involve major estate regeneration, moving residents out of their homes while we build them new ones, which of course creates a lot of anxiety. We've developed a list of pledges to hopefully give local people some reassurances about their future homes and neighbourhoods. We have promised: \u2022 if you are a Camden tenant you will remain a Camden tenant \u2022 you will not have to move out of the borough or your local area unless you want to \u2022 leaseholders will be compensated for loss of their property by market value plus up to 10% I'm not sure about the North Sea oil comparison, but I believe it is the right strategy for Camden because our mounting repair bill would cost taxpayers more if we did nothing. It's a long-term plan that will help us to invest in Camden at a time when we can't rely on government funding and to improve the public services that our residents value most.

      "body": "<p>It's been described as the \"North Sea oil strategy\" by our local press. And it's certainly making an impression, with the echo of lively public meetings still ringing in my ears.</p> <p>Introducing our new community investment programme was never going to be easy because, fundamentally, it is a plan B. Facing more than \u00a3200m in capital funding cuts from government for schools, plus a housing repairs bill that nearly doubles that, we're not going to be able to solve all our problems \u2013 and there will be some tough decisions over those we can solve.</p> <p>We're in a relatively unique position in Camden: in the 1970s the council bought a large portfolio of land across the borough. Despite the economic climate, our inner-London location means property prices continue to rise steadily. However, with responsibility as landlord comes a hefty maintenance bill plus many buildings now at the end of their natural lives.</p> <p>We are using this as a positive opportunity to look across the council's portfolio and consider how we can release some of the value of these old buildings and underused land, to reinvest into upgrading our housing stock (which we manage in-house) and community facilities. It will also allow us to create one of the biggest social housing building programmes in the capital with more than 850 new council rent or shared ownership homes planned to be built.</p> <p>Selling off the family silver? No: we will be selling a smaller percentage of our stock than we redevelop, and we will be able to make some big changes to our neighbourhoods. This includes investing \u00a3119m into housing repairs and \u00a3117m for our schools and children's centres.</p> <p>But crucially the assets for sale are not council homes. One of our key aims is to build more social housing and tackle some of the inequality we know exists in areas with poor quality housing. We are already delivering the first schemes so we know it works.</p> <p>It won't all happen overnight. This is a 15-year programme with more than 80 projects in the first phase and more sites to be identified. It's crucial we genuinely work with local communities. That's not shorthand for meaningless consultations. It means real examples where local people have been involved in design workshops, on panels to appoint architects and setting up new community bodies to take part in creating their new homes and community facilities.</p> <p>It's by no means plain sailing. On some schemes, in order to rebuild community facilities like a school and release cash to fund repairs to existing council homes, we may have to adopt less than a 50:50 split of affordable to private housing to fund the development.</p> <p>Other projects involve major estate regeneration, moving residents out of their homes while we build them new ones, which of course creates a lot of anxiety. We've developed a list of pledges to hopefully give local people some reassurances about their future homes and neighbourhoods. We have promised:</p> <p>\u2022 if you are a Camden tenant you will remain a Camden tenant</p> <p>\u2022 you will not have to move out of the borough or your local area unless you want to</p> <p>\u2022 leaseholders will be compensated for loss of their property by market value plus up to 10%</p> <p>I'm not sure about the North Sea oil comparison, but I believe it is the right strategy for Camden because our mounting repair bill would cost taxpayers more if we did nothing. It's a long-term plan that will help us to invest in Camden at a time when we can't rely on government funding and to improve the public services that our residents value most.</p> <p><em>Mike Cooke is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.camden.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Camden council</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to your inbox</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Leafs swap coach (aka The Burke Saga: Chapter 1,000,000) Brian Burke is one of the more polarizing characters of the last decade in the NHL, and sure enough, he just added another chapter to his saga this week when he fired Maple Leafs head coach Ron Wilson (and replacing him with former Ducks coach \u2013 and past Burkian acolyte \u2013 Randy Carlyle). We can probably debate whether Wilson's exit came either too late or too soon in the Leafs' season, but what remains in his stead is a mess. When Carlyle came on board, he told a press conference he \"sensed that the hockey club is very, very tense right now.\" If Carlyle was hired for his powers of perception, Burke might have made another misstep. Prior to their win in Montreal Saturday night, the Leafs were on a dismal slide down the Eastern standings, losing 10 of their 11 previous games. They seemingly have even less of an idea of who should stand in goal every night than they did two weeks ago, and until the middle of the second period on Saturday, they looked unreservedly lacklustre; Gustavsson, who was given the job of tending the twine, literally fell over himself mishandling the puck at one point. They pulled off the win in the end \u2013 to the last-placed team in the conference. Added to all of this was CBC's resident loudmouth Don Cherry's decision to dedicate his Coach's Corner segment to giving Burke a piece of his mind. This wasn't a surprise. It was yet another salvo launched in what has become one of the more ridiculous sideline battles Burke has chosen to fight this year in Toronto. It started a while ago when Burke was unhappy that Cherry had been criticizing the Leafs on TV \u2013 particularly his singling out of Wilson and and his belief the Leafs under Wilson were prone to throwing good players (like Nazem Kadri) \"under the bus\". Cherry claimed Burke had a meeting with the CBC about his comments behind his back. In what is now an amusing asterisk on the whole thing, Wilson said he'd be happy to put his coaching record up against Cherry's, to which Cherry listed off the instances where he, as Bruins coach, had lost to Montreal in the playoffs. \"But maybe Ron is right because since he has been with the Leafs he hasn't lost a playoff game,\" Cherry quipped. Anyway, Cherry got into it again on Saturday. Cherry's beef this time centred on the fact that there are no Ontario players on the Leafs' roster, just American college kids. Or something. Watch here (starts around 0:35). Which all means that Sunday morning, things in Toronto were no more settled than they were the week before, minus a few \"fire Wilson\" chants anticipated upon their return to the Air Canada Centre. There are still issues with this team, but Burke has already hinted where he sees things at the moment and where he sees them going, and they might give Leafs fans another opportunity to boast that next year could be their year (to make the playoffs, that is). For one, aside from the early-going of this season, Carlyle has a good record \u2013 something the Leafs were pleased to highlight when he was hired: \"Randy Carlyle, 55, spent seven seasons as the Anaheim Ducks' head coach. He was named the seventh head coach in team history on Aug. 1, 2005, and led the Ducks to their first Stanley Cup championship (2007), Pacific Division championship (2007) and five playoff appearances (2005-09, 2011). Only one NHL coach has won more postseason games than Carlyle's 36 since 2005-06 (Mike Babcock).\" In hiring Carlyle now, Burke said he was hoping to better set up the Leafs for the beginning of next season \u2013 that he would give Carlyle a month and a half (presumably at the least) to evaluate the current squad alongside new assistant coach Dave Farrish. Additionally, the personal relationships at work are interesting: Carlyle, Farrish and Burke were all together in Anaheim in 2007 when they brought in a Stanely Cup. Burke and Carlyle have also known each other since college. All of that probably bodes well, if only the franchise can somehow shake its complete and utterly baffling trend toward total mediocrity. What Cherry was ultimately venting about \u2013 the message behind the bloated, self-serving rhetoric \u2013 was the frustration in Leafs Nation that with all that money pouring in every year, the team seems determined to lumber, rather than race, toward finding the best of the best. Cherry's rant was half a bizarre manifestation of overwrought nationalism and half a desperate attempt to offer one last possible reason that the mighty Leafs, with buying power, a solid and consistent fan base, and a skilled General Manager can't seem to get it together no matter what they do. It's an aggravating half-century to be a Leafs fan. You Can Play Another Burke story, I'm afraid, but this one is more than deserving of accolades, rather than scorn or disdain from hockey fans, no matter where you happen to be from. In 2009, Burke's late son Brendan officially came out and began advocating for gay rights in hockey. \"There are a lot of gay athletes out there and gay people working pro sports that deserve to know that there are safe environments where people are supportive of you regardless of your sexual orientation,\" Brendan told TSN in 2009, only months before he died, tragically, in a car accident in early 2010 in Indiana. Brian Burke, along with his other son, Patrick, have now launched an initiative, the You Can Play project, which aims \"to provide a means for athletes, coaches, and fans to stand up and create an atmosphere of inclusion.\" The organization has a clip that will start being broadcast during NHL games, including this past Sunday's meeting between the Rangers and Bruins: . Over at Puck Daddy, Patrick Burke spoke to Greg Wyshynski: \"\"Those guys are using homophobic slurs but not meaning them in a homophobic sense. You see a guy say 'don't be gay' and he's not saying 'don't be a homosexual,' he's saying 'don't be an ass. We're all about makin' fun of each other. I understand how guys bond. But we need to cut out that language so those athletes that are hiding can feel safe.\" Over at CBC, Burke is quoted: \"The Burke family is very proud to carry on Brendan's legacy. \u2026 The You Can Play project will serve as a tremendous resource for the sports community by providing them with the tools needed to create safe arenas. I continue to be incredibly grateful to the NHL community for rallying around our cause and standing up for equality, and I look forward to seeing other leagues do the same. It has become abundantly clear to me that NHL players, coaches, and management agree completely with our ideals: talent matters, sexual orientation does not.\" If you haven't already, be sure to check out this piece on Brian Burke from GQ, where he discusses his son's death and his commitment to carrying on his wishes. Shooting for three Over at ESPN, Pierre Lebrun decided to take up the 3-points-for-a-win debate yet again. His post was spurred by comments returning Team Canada executive director (as of Monday), Steve Yzerman, made to ESPN. Yzerman simply said: \"I just think a regulation win should be most important.\" And while he has no fundamental grudge against the 4-on-4 overtime, he said the shoot-out \"is a roll of the dice, it doesn't prove who the better team is.\" Instead, he said, just reward the team who can pull off a 'W' in 60 minutes. And lo, Lebrun agrees, advocating for a 3-2-1 point system \u2013 as it is in the Olympics, fittingly enough. The main opposition, as voiced by Detroit GM Ken Holland, is that in the current scheme, the playoff races are so tight, it would be crazy to get rid of them. Lebrun offers a counter-point: \"What about how difficult it is for a team to come from behind in the standings at this time of year? The Anaheim Ducks have gone 17-5-4 in their past 26 games and, while they've made up some ground, they remained seven points out of a playoff spot as of Friday morning. This is largely because of other teams around them picking up points every night either in wins or often in OT/SO losses. It clogs up the standings. Given that 14 of Anaheim's 17 wins were in regulation during that stretch, wouldn't it be more accurate to reward the Ducks for all those regulation-time victories?\" Well, yes. That seems reasonable. But the current argument from a lot of people in the NHL is that it actually wouldn't make much difference in the standings. Over at the CBC, they took a look at the numbers a bit more closely and they noticed something. \"For the second straight season that we've tracked it, games go beyond 60 minutes at a much higher rate when featuring clubs from opposing conferences than those from the same conference. [...] So far this season, about 31 per cent of contests pitting Western with Eastern Conference clubs go into an extra session. That figure is about 21 percent for intraconference games. About 60 per cent of the remaining intraconference games would have to beyond 60 minutes to reach a similar percentage.(For the record, the East has featured a handful more 60-65 minute games than the West). Yes, interconference games are a smaller sample size, but these figures are in line with what transpired last season.\" What that might mean is simply that teams are less concerned about forking over a point to a team from the other conference than to one in their own. No big surprise, I guess, but the question remains as to whether that attitude might change if there were more points on the line for a 60-minute win. Would it kill the apathy (should it exist?). It might tighten inter-conference games to a similar degree as those between conference rivals. Surely that would be a benefit to all? Granted, one of the dangers of the 3-point win system might be that teams fall behind early and are unable to recover. So what do we think? Is it time again for the NHL to consider this regulation-time point change? Discuss in the comments. Who are the Buffalo Sabres and what have they done with the Buffalo Sabres? Yes, granted, the Sabres lost to Winnipeg Monday night, but all you need to do is watch one minute and ten seconds of these highlights from their game against Vancouver Saturday night to see why people are talking in Buffalo \u2013 and why people are having nightmares in Vancouver. Here's what happened on my end Saturday night. I got home after being out to a bar to take in another Canadiens-Leafs tilt (\"Isn't it amazing how this game would have at one point been between two of the best teams in the league,\" an acquaintance marvelled) and turned on the Sabres-Canucks game on mute, just as background distraction. I watched the puck drop. I looked back up. It was 2-0. And suddenly, the post-trade deadline Sabres looked all the more promising. Their steady play of late started well before that date, but this was certainly the first hint that maybe something was actually possible in Buffalo, despite such a rocky mid-season. Again, Monday's loss aside, this was a Buffalo team we haven't seen in a while. Paul Waldie at the Globe and Mail noted that \"the Sabres went unbeaten in eight games and posted three straight wins over the Anaheim Ducks, San Joes Sharks and Vancouver Canucks. Miller earned back to back shutouts and his save percentage jumped to .958 from .897 in January.\" Coach Lindy Ruff chalked it up to \"treating every game like a playoff game.\" One assumes that's only of late, and, subsequently one might be compelled to ask why that isn't the team's approach all year, but, well... Anyway, back in Vancouver, the loss came as a bit of a shock \u2013 not to mention the fact that Luongo was pulled out early on, replaced by his backup and (probably) nemesis, Corey Schneider. Though new (former Sabres) recruit, Zack Kassian had a goal and an assist, it was lost in the worry that the Canucks showed some very startling vulnerability to a team they should have been quickly and deftly man-handled. Elliott Pap at the Vancouver Sun summed up some of the biggest problems this way: \"The team had a wretched start - giving up three goals by the 5: 10 mark - thanks to some abysmal defensive zone coverage and a lousy Roberto Luongo performance. The Sedin twins were again held without a point, Aaron Rome was minus-3 and the ineffective Mason Raymond continued to be the ineffective Mason Raymond.\" Yikes. Now, it's hard to think that the Sedins have suddenly hit, in one game, an incurable slump that will destroy the team's playoff and Stanley Cup hopes. They'll no doubt recover, if not fairly quickly. No, they're not the worry. It's the end of that first sentence: \"A lousy Roberto Luongo performance.\" How familiar was this exit to Canucks fans who sat through the finals last year? Another early rattling of the cage and Luongo folds like a newspaper, gets pulled and has to try to recover for the next game, all the while undermining team confidence. Oof. For his part, Luongo later told reporters that he felt the loss should have been his, not Schneiders. Not that it matters now. But maybe it wasn't all Luongo's fault. Over at the Province, Tony Gallagher points outwards, to the rest of the team who he says came out to a \"lethargic\" and \"indifferent\" start. Coming back from a 3-0 deficit is difficult, no matter who you are, especially if the other team happens to have that guy Ryan Miller in net, and he's playing as described above. In any case, while it might not be time to panic in Vancouver, it could be time to start looking down the line at Buffalo's last few weeks and gaming out possible end results. The loss to the Jets won't help, and neither would one to the Bruins in a few days. But looking down the line, the Sabres have a chance to pick up points against Eastern teams in the next week or so. Before the end of the month they'll play the Habs twice (sorry Montreal, I love you, but at least one of these probably won't go your way); the Lightning, Hurricanes, Caps and Panthers (the latter of which is only a slim possible win at this point); and might pull off a couple of points against the Avalanche and Wild while they're at it. The true tests will come against the aforementioned Bruins, the Sentors and the Rangers, who will be mixed in before the 24th. And they'll need all the points they can get. They have two late-season games against the Leafs \u2013 a team against which at this point it seems they'll be fighting for a playoff spot \u2013 with games againt the Flyers, Penguins and Bruins rounding out their final five appearances. So buckle up, Buffalo. This could be an interesting finale. Would you want it any other way? Goals! Including what TSN\"s Jay Onrait described rightly as Winnipeg's \"flying 'W'\". Unfortunately, the NHL's number one goal this week is one we saw last week, so below, I'll give you an extra, care of Steve Stamkos. . The Stamkos extra point: .",

Lebrun offers a counter-point:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What about how difficult it is for a team to come from behind in the standings at this time of year?</p> <p>The Anaheim Ducks have gone 17-5-4 in their past 26 games and, while they've made up some ground, they remained seven points out of a playoff spot as of Friday morning. This is largely because of other teams around them picking up points every night either in wins or often in OT/SO losses. It clogs up the standings.</p> <p>Given that 14 of Anaheim's 17 wins were in regulation during that stretch, wouldn't it be more accurate to reward the Ducks for all those regulation-time victories?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, yes. That seems reasonable. But the current argument from a lot of people in the NHL is that it actually wouldn't make much difference in the standings. <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/opinion/2012/03/nhl-overtime-games.html\">Over at the CBC, they took a look at the numbers a bit more closely and they noticed something</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"For the second straight season that we've tracked it, games go beyond 60 minutes at a much higher rate when featuring clubs from opposing conferences than those from the same conference. [...] </p> <p>So far this season, about 31 per cent of contests pitting Western with Eastern Conference clubs go into an extra session. That figure is about 21 percent for intraconference games. About 60 per cent of the remaining intraconference games would have to beyond 60 minutes to reach a similar percentage.(For the record, the East has featured a handful more 60-65 minute games than the West). Yes, interconference games are a smaller sample size, but these figures are in line with what transpired last season.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>What that might mean is simply that teams are less concerned about forking over a point to a team from the other conference than to one in their own. No big surprise, I guess, but the question remains as to whether that attitude might change if there were more points on the line for a 60-minute win. Would it kill the apathy (should it exist?). It might tighten inter-conference games to a similar degree as those between conference rivals. Surely that would be a benefit to all? </p> <p>Granted, one of the dangers of the 3-point win system might be that teams fall behind early and are unable to recover. </p> <p>So what do we think? Is it time again for the NHL to consider this regulation-time point change? Discuss in the comments.</p> <h2>Who are the Buffalo Sabres and what have they done with the Buffalo Sabres?</h2> <p>Yes, granted, the Sabres lost to Winnipeg Monday night, but all you need to do is watch one minute and ten seconds of <a href=\"http://youtu.be/oHOj6lZGSeI\">these highlights from their game against Vancouver</a> Saturday night to see why people are talking in Buffalo \u2013 and why people are having nightmares in Vancouver.</p> <p>Here's what happened on my end Saturday night. I got home after being out to a bar to take in another Canadiens-Leafs tilt (\"Isn't it amazing how this game would have at one point been between two of the best teams in the league,\" an acquaintance marvelled) and turned on the Sabres-Canucks game on mute, just as background distraction. I watched the puck drop. I looked back up. It was 2-0.</p> <p>And suddenly, the post-trade deadline Sabres looked all the more promising. Their steady play of late started well before that date, but this was certainly the first hint that maybe something was actually possible in Buffalo, despite such a rocky mid-season. Again, Monday's loss aside, this was a Buffalo team we haven't seen in a while.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/globe-on-hockey/sabres-are-back-from-the-dead/article2359361/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_content=2359361\">Paul Waldie at the Globe and Mail noted</a> that \"the Sabres went unbeaten in eight games and posted three straight wins over the Anaheim Ducks, San Joes Sharks and Vancouver Canucks. Miller earned back to back shutouts and his save percentage jumped to .958 from .897 in January.\" Coach Lindy Ruff chalked it up to \"treating every game like a playoff game.\" One assumes that's only of late, and, subsequently one might be compelled to ask why that isn't the team's approach all year, but, well...</p> <p>Anyway, back in Vancouver, the loss came as a bit of a shock \u2013 not to mention the fact that Luongo was pulled out early on, replaced by his backup and (probably) nemesis, Corey Schneider. Though new (former Sabres) recruit, Zack Kassian had a goal and an assist, it was lost in the worry that the Canucks showed some very startling vulnerability to a team they should have been quickly and deftly man-handled.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.canada.com/sports/Sabres+rattle+Luongo+silence+Sedins/6251049/story.html\">Elliott Pap at the Vancouver Sun summed up</a> some of the biggest problems this way:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The team had a wretched start - giving up three goals by the 5: 10 mark - thanks to some abysmal defensive zone coverage and a lousy Roberto Luongo performance. The Sedin twins were again held without a point, Aaron Rome was minus-3 and the ineffective Mason Raymond continued to be the ineffective Mason Raymond.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Yikes. </p> <p>Now, it's hard to think that the Sedins have suddenly hit, in one game, an incurable slump that will destroy the team's playoff and Stanley Cup hopes. They'll no doubt recover, if not fairly quickly. No, they're not the worry. It's the end of that first sentence: \"A lousy Roberto Luongo performance.\" How familiar was this exit to Canucks fans who sat through the finals last year? Another early rattling of the cage and Luongo folds like a newspaper, gets pulled and has to try to recover for the next game, all the while undermining team confidence. Oof. </p> <p>For his part, Luongo later told reporters that he felt the loss should have been his, not Schneiders. Not that it matters now.</p> <p>But maybe it wasn't all Luongo's fault. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KiUjpOnSIut1xWxqgzMh2qG0X8Q5In1ZPA5Xh6Idy6Y/edit?pli=1\">Over at the Province</a>, Tony Gallagher points outwards, to the rest of the team who he says came out to a \"lethargic\" and \"indifferent\" start. Coming back from a 3-0 deficit is difficult, no matter who you are, especially if the other team happens to have that guy Ryan Miller in net, and he's playing as described above.</p> <p>In any case, while it might not be time to panic in Vancouver, it could be time to start looking down the line at Buffalo's last few weeks and gaming out possible end results. The loss to the Jets won't help, and neither would one to the Bruins in a few days. But looking down the line, the Sabres have a chance to pick up points against Eastern teams in the next week or so. Before the end of the month they'll play the Habs twice (sorry Montreal, I love you, but at least one of these probably won't go your way); the Lightning, Hurricanes, Caps and Panthers (the latter of which is only a slim possible win at this point); and might pull off a couple of points against the Avalanche and Wild while they're at it. The true tests will come against the aforementioned Bruins, the Sentors and the Rangers, who will be mixed in before the 24th. </p> <p>And they'll need all the points they can get. They have two late-season games against the Leafs \u2013 a team against which at this point it seems they'll be fighting for a playoff spot \u2013 with games againt the Flyers, Penguins and Bruins rounding out their final five appearances. So buckle up, Buffalo. This could be an interesting finale. Would you want it any other way?</p> <h2>Goals!</h2> <p>Including what TSN\"s Jay Onrait described rightly as Winnipeg's \"flying 'W'\". Unfortunately, the NHL's number one goal this week is one we saw last week, so below, I'll give you an extra, care of Steve Stamkos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://nhl.cdn.neulion.net/u/videocenter/embed.swf\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"embed\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://nhl.cdn.neulion.net/u/videocenter/embed.swf\" /><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"catid=17&amp;id=161723&amp;server=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&amp;pageurl=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&amp;nlwa=http://app2.neulion.com/videocenter/nhl/\" /><embed name=\"embed\" pluginspage=\"http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer\" src=\"https://nhl.cdn.neulion.net/u/videocenter/embed.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"460\" height=\"369\" quality=\"high\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" flashvars=\"catid=17&amp;id=161723&amp;server=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&amp;pageurl=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&amp;nlwa=http://app2.neulion.com/videocenter/nhl/\"></embed></object> </figure>  <p>.<br>The Stamkos extra point:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://nhl.cdn.neulion.net/u/videocenter/embed.swf\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"embed\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://nhl.cdn.neulion.net/u/videocenter/embed.swf\" /><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"catid=35&amp;id=162080&amp;server=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&amp;pageurl=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&amp;nlwa=http://app2.neulion.com/videocenter/nhl\" /><embed name=\"embed\" pluginspage=\"http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer\" src=\"https://nhl.cdn.neulion.net/u/videocenter/embed.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"460\" height=\"369\" quality=\"high\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" flashvars=\"catid=35&amp;id=162080&amp;server=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&amp;pageurl=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&amp;nlwa=http://app2.neulion.com/videocenter/nhl\"></embed></object> </figure>  <p>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At first sight \u2013 and it's a long first sight, lasting a good 200 of the book's 340 brilliant and frustrating pages of text \u2013 Turing's Cathedral appears to be a project for which George Dyson has failed to find a form. Ostensibly the story of the building of one of the earliest computers at Princeton in the late 1940s and early 50s, it keeps digressing wildly. The Institute for Advanced Study's MANIAC gets under construction over and over, in chapter after chapter, only for Dyson to veer off again into the biographical backstories of the constructors, and a myriad of alternative intellectual hinterlands, from hydrogen bomb design to game theory to weather prediction, by way of the caf\u00e9 society of interwar Budapest. It's not that these aren't relevant. They are; but they aren't introduced in the cumulative, surreptitiously spoon-feeding way in which good pop-sci writing usually coaxes a linear narrative out of complex material. If this is a cathedral, it doesn't have anything as geometrical as a nave. It's a mass of separate structures joined by spiders' webs of coloured string. But it isn't a failure. It isn't one thing at all. It's three successes: three separate and different and differently impressive books Dyson might have written, all bizarrely shredded and mixed into a heap whose sorting is left as an exercise for the reader. Some of it is a painstaking oral history of MANIAC, built on an archivist's certainty that everything is worth rescuing from entropy that can possibly be known about the dawn of the digital computer. Truly everything, from interviews with as many of the surviving engineers as possible in the 1990s, to the institute's cafeteria manager's unexpected history testing Bl\u00e9riot monoplanes in 1912, and the director's complaint in 1946 that the engineers were putting too much sugar in their tea. This part of the book is a monument (or rather a bit-stream of a monument). Some of it is an intellectual biography of MANIAC's chief architect John Von Neumann and the circle around him, determined to do justice to the polymathic range of his genius, and therefore dipping into everything he contributed to, from bomb design to game theory to robotics. Alan Turing, after whom the book is misnamed \u2013 it should really be called \"Johnny's Web\" \u2013 only comes into the picture seriously on page 242. He is merely the collaborator of Von Neumann who happened to stand along the particular out-raying string of his interest that happened to lead to the intellectual foundations of the digital age. But since Dyson himself is passionately interested in those, in comes the third separate thing the book is, a speculative, even visionary account of the philosophy of programming. This last, marvellous element dominates the end of the book; and having reached it, and begun to be able to make sense in retrospect of the digressive tangle that came before, you ask yourself whether its design might possibly have been consciously, artfully non-linear. A kind of literary equivalent to the whole-genome shotgun method, maybe, with the shredding of multiple projects handing over to us the job of sequencing and unification. But it feels less willed than that, more the interference pattern of three different ambitions, none of which the author was ready to relinquish. And it does, no denying, take persistence. Is it worth persisting? Absolutely. Let me give you, appropriately enough, three reasons why. One: no other book about the beginnings of the digital age brings to life anything like so vividly or appreciatively the immense engineering difficulty of creating electronic logic for the first time; of creating originally, and without a template, the pattern of organisation which has since become absolutely routine, and been etched on silicon at ever smaller micron-distances in chip foundries. The very word \"foundry\" insists that logic is a commodity, a material, the steel of the information age. But it didn't start like that. It started as an elaborate, just-possible accomplishment, requiring both conceptual brilliance and ingenious hands-on tinkering. It had to be built from scratch at the macro level, as an assemblage of valves and hand-wired circuits and cathode-ray tubes, fed by power at many different voltages, and protected from hazards ranging from roofing-tar to thunderstorms to the magnetic fields of passing trams. When Dyson describes the MANIAC being designed into its casing \"like the folding of a cerebral cortex\", you know he means \u2013 specifically that, like a brain. He has read the error logs in which the baffled pioneers tried to work out which of a hundred causes produced each failure, from a simple error in coding logic to the finicky failure of adjacent phosphor spots to stay distinctly charged. \"I know when I'm licked.\" \"This now is the 3rd different output.\" \"To hell with it!\" Two: no other book has engaged so intelligently and disconcertingly with the digital age's relationship to nuclear weapons research, not just as a moral quandary to do with funding, but as an indispensable developmental influence, producing the conceptual tools that would unlock the intellectual power of the computer. The \"Monte Carlo\" method (Von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam) was born as a means to track the probability of a thermonuclear reaction staying supercritical in a hydrogen bomb. If there had been no branching paths of scattering, splitting, absorbing or escaping neutrons to be modelled, there might well have been no algorithms to simulate the probabilistic paths of evolution, finance, climate. Conversely, if there had been no Monte Carlo algorithm running at electronic speed on Maniac itself, there would have been no American H-bomb in 1952, vaporising 80m tons of Enewetak Atoll in a red cloud boiling half the sky. Three: no other book \u2013 this is where we get visionary \u2013 makes the connections this one does between the lessons of the computer's origin and the possible paths of its future. Dyson takes his cue from Turing and Von Neumann's ability to see all the way to the limits of the digital architecture they were themselves proposing and struggling to substantiate for the first time. In the late 1940s they were already thinking about the essential rigidity and (from one point of view) logical inefficiency of machines which, unlike living information processors, can only do one thing at a time, leaving the whole elaborate structure of the rest idle. As Dyson puts it: \"There is a thin veneer of instructions, and then there is a dark empty 99.9%.\" Yet the \"Von Neumann architecture\" of a memory passing individual bits to a processor, each with its own unique memory address, is not the only possible one, and not the only one considered by Von Neumann, for that matter. Dyson believes that the birth of other architectures atop the reliable substrate of the digital-as-we-know-it is now imminent. Some of his suggestions may be, let's say, in advance of the evidence, like the idea that Google represents a first sketch of what Turing called \"an oracle machine\", supplementing its own deterministic states with the non-deterministic input of human queries. But then so were many of Turing's and Von Neumann's ideas a little previous, to say the least. Most of us should persist in reading this for the scrambled richness of its history. But I suspect that one of its afterlives is going to be as a source of koans for coders, troublingly simple questions to be copied out, and sellotaped to workstations, and stared at until \u2013 eureka! \u2013 something new happens in a human mind, and shortly thereafter in one of its electric surrogates. \u2022 Francis Spufford's Red Plenty is published by Faber.",

They are; but they aren't introduced in the cumulative, surreptitiously spoon-feeding way in which good pop-sci writing usually coaxes a linear narrative out of complex material.</p> <p>If this is a cathedral, it doesn't have anything as geometrical as a nave. It's a mass of separate structures joined by spiders' webs of coloured string. But it isn't a failure. It isn't one thing at all. It's three successes: three separate and different and differently impressive books Dyson might have written, all bizarrely shredded and mixed into a heap whose sorting is left as an exercise for the reader. Some of it is a painstaking oral history of MANIAC, built on an archivist's certainty that everything is worth rescuing from entropy that can possibly be known about the dawn of the digital computer. Truly everything, from interviews with as many of the surviving engineers as possible in the 1990s, to the institute's cafeteria manager's unexpected history testing Bl\u00e9riot monoplanes in 1912, and the director's complaint in 1946 that the engineers were putting too much sugar in their tea. This part of the book is a monument (or rather a bit-stream of a monument).</p> <p>Some of it is an intellectual biography of MANIAC's chief architect <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann\" title=\"\">John Von Neumann</a> and the circle around him, determined to do justice to the polymathic range of his genius, and therefore dipping into everything he contributed to, from bomb design to game theory to robotics. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/alan-turing\" title=\"\">Alan Turing</a>, after whom the book is misnamed \u2013 it should really be called \"Johnny's Web\" \u2013 only comes into the picture seriously on page 242. He is merely the collaborator of Von Neumann who happened to stand along the particular out-raying string of his interest that happened to lead to the intellectual foundations of the digital age. But since Dyson himself is passionately interested in those, in comes the third separate thing the book is, a speculative, even visionary account of the philosophy of programming.</p> <p>This last, marvellous element dominates the end of the book; and having reached it, and begun to be able to make sense in retrospect of the digressive tangle that came before, you ask yourself whether its design might possibly have been consciously, artfully non-linear. A kind of literary equivalent to the whole-genome shotgun method, maybe, with the shredding of multiple projects handing over to us the job of sequencing and unification. But it feels less willed than that, more the interference pattern of three different ambitions, none of which the author was ready to relinquish. And it does, no denying, take persistence. Is it worth persisting? Absolutely. Let me give you, appropriately enough, three reasons why.</p> <p>One: no other book about the beginnings of the digital age brings to life anything like so vividly or appreciatively the immense engineering difficulty of creating electronic logic for the first time; of creating originally, and without a template, the pattern of organisation which has since become absolutely routine, and been etched on silicon at ever smaller micron-distances in chip foundries. The very word \"foundry\" insists that logic is a commodity, a material, the steel of the information age. But it didn't start like that. It started as an elaborate, just-possible accomplishment, requiring both conceptual brilliance and ingenious hands-on tinkering. It had to be built from scratch at the macro level, as an assemblage of valves and hand-wired circuits and cathode-ray tubes, fed by power at many different voltages, and protected from hazards ranging from roofing-tar to thunderstorms to the magnetic fields of passing trams. When Dyson describes the MANIAC being designed into its casing \"like the folding of a cerebral cortex\", you know he means \u2013 specifically that, like a brain. He has read the error logs in which the baffled pioneers tried to work out which of a hundred causes produced each failure, from a simple error in coding logic to the finicky failure of adjacent phosphor spots to stay distinctly charged. \"I know when I'm licked.\" \"This now is the 3rd different output.\" \"To hell with it!\"</p> <p>Two: no other book has engaged so intelligently and disconcertingly with the digital age's relationship to nuclear weapons research, not just as a moral quandary to do with funding, but as an indispensable developmental influence, producing the conceptual tools that would unlock the intellectual power of the computer. The \"Monte Carlo\" method (Von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam) was born as a means to track the probability of a thermonuclear reaction staying supercritical in a hydrogen bomb. If there had been no branching paths of scattering, splitting, absorbing or escaping neutrons to be modelled, there might well have been no algorithms to simulate the probabilistic paths of evolution, finance, climate. Conversely, if there had been no Monte Carlo algorithm running at electronic speed on Maniac itself, there would have been no American H-bomb in 1952, vaporising 80m tons of Enewetak Atoll in a red cloud boiling half the sky.</p> <p>Three: no other book \u2013 this is where we get visionary \u2013 makes the connections this one does between the lessons of the computer's origin and the possible paths of its future. Dyson takes his cue from Turing and Von Neumann's ability to see all the way to the limits of the digital architecture they were themselves proposing and struggling to substantiate for the first time.</p> <p>In the late 1940s they were already thinking about the essential rigidity and (from one point of view) logical inefficiency of machines which, unlike living information processors, can only do one thing at a time, leaving the whole elaborate structure of the rest idle. As Dyson puts it: \"There is a thin veneer of instructions, and then there is a dark empty 99.9%.\" Yet the \"Von Neumann architecture\" of a memory passing individual bits to a processor, each with its own unique memory address, is not the only possible one, and not the only one considered by Von Neumann, for that matter. Dyson believes that the birth of other architectures atop the reliable substrate of the digital-as-we-know-it is now imminent. Some of his suggestions may be, let's say, in advance of the evidence, like the idea that Google represents a first sketch of what Turing called \"an oracle machine\", supplementing its own deterministic states with the non-deterministic input of human queries. But then so were many of Turing's and Von Neumann's ideas a little previous, to say the least.</p> <p>Most of us should persist in reading this for the scrambled richness of its history. But I suspect that one of its afterlives is going to be as a source of koans for coders, troublingly simple questions to be copied out, and sellotaped to workstations, and stared at until \u2013 eureka! \u2013 something new happens in a human mind, and shortly thereafter in one of its electric surrogates.</p> <p>\u2022 Francis Spufford's <em>Red Plenty</em> is published by Faber.</p>",

GDP grew just half as fast as expected in the final quarter of 2011, rising 0.4%, according to official data released on Wednesday. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a dip in business spending from record highs and a slowdown in household spending. There was also downward pressure from farm stocks being run down, leaving the growth rate at just half the 0.8% notched up in the third quarter. But stronger growth earlier in 2011 meant GDP was up 2.3% on a year earlier, almost matching the 2.4% growth rate forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. The government sought to stress that Australia's growth still significantly outstripped that in other developed economies in the fourth quarter, when the UK contracted 0.2% and the eurozone shrank 0.3%. Australian treasurer Wayne Swan said the country was not immune to outside pressures as the eurozone sovereign debt crisis persists. \"Despite our underlying strengths, we always said that global instability would impact our economy, and these headwinds have added to existing pressures from the sustained high dollar and the cautious consumer,\" he said. But he echoed the country's central bank in predicting more solid growth for the year ahead. \"Our low unemployment, sturdy public finances, very low debt, contained inflation, and huge pipeline of investment provide a solid foundation that will help us withstand global turbulence,\" Swan added. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expects growth of between 3% and 3.5% this year as Australia's resource-rich economy benefits from strong demand from China. The RBA held interest rates steady at 4.25% earlier this week but analysts and financial markets have now scaled up expectations of a cut in coming months. The unexpectedly sharp slowdown in growth knocked the Australian dollar down to a six-week low as it added to pressure from the eurozone debt crisis.",

Unlike haptics until this point, Senseg is working on creating complex textures rather than simply buzzing your fingertips. The aim is to make a corrugated surface feel corrugated, a rough surface rough, a soft surface soft. The first products will ship by the end of this year and again Nokia is not Senseg's first port of call. \"We are currently working with a certain tablet maker based in Cupertino,\" reveals Senseg senior vice president Ville M\u00e4kinen. Since then Makinen has become a lot more reticent. Wonder why? iOS Ebb and Flow &gt;&gt; pxldot I'd like to fill in the picture I began in my recent post on Android fragmentation by examining the changes in version distribution of the other major mobile operating system: iOS. Unfortunately, this was no quite as easy as it was for Android. Unlike Google, Apple does not publish the version distribution of its user base. What we do have, however, is a number of developers who have published the version distribution within their own apps, and if we can collect a large enough sample it may be feasible to use these in lieu of direct vendor-supplied data. Using 50 data points from different developers, we can indeed build an image of version distribution over time for iOS just as we did for Android. Note that these are bundled into major releases. Grouping these into the major releases reduced noise and also matched the groupings more closely to those I used for the Android post -- while it may not be a direct Apples-to-Apples comparison, it is likely the best we can do. Beautiful, beautiful graphics (which suggest that iOS 5 reached 75% of users in less than a month - huh?) but it overlooks the fact that Google really doesn't care about fragmentation. All it wants is to have people connecting to the internet and using its search engine. What to Expect at Apple's Event &gt;&gt; Gizmodo Mat Honan: And unless you accuse the media of being biased towards Apple products, you should have figured out by now that none of us even care. Who cares. Nobody cares. We are all so jaded and cynical that if cow shit brought in an audience, we would all be sitting in a pasture, DSLRs in hand, waiting breathlessly for the next patty to fall. Or at least, many of us would. We cover what we cover because it's what you want us to cover. And as long as the audience comes in, we'll be there to receive you. Mat Honan may be our favourite commentator ever on technology events. Why it took me five months to write @whensmytube &gt;&gt; qwghlm.co.uk Chris Applegate: I was too busy adding the features for @whensmybus, and that's one reason why it took me five months to write its counterpart, @whensmytube, which I launched last week. But there's a stack of other reasons why it took so long. It didn't seem too difficult to begin with. Just like with buses, Transport for London have made their Tube departure data open-source (via a system called TrackerNet), as well as the locations of all their stations. It would be pretty simple to do the same for tube data as it would for bus data, right? Wrong. Fascinating look into the hassle of not-quite-open data. Judge orders Motorola to provide Apple details of Google's acquisition plans, Android development The U.S. Circuit Judge overseeing the patent dispute between Apple and Motorola Mobility has ordered Motorola to provide Apple with details of Google's $12.5 billion acquisition as well as information about the development of Android. In a filing on March 2, Apple requested to obtain the information stating that \"the Android/Motorola acquisition discovery is highly relevant to Apple's claims and defenses\" in its ongoing patent suit against Motorola, which is also countersuing Apple. Now this is going to be interesting. May 2011: Google chairman Schmidt promises privacy controls &gt;&gt; BBC News May 2011: Google chairman Eric Schmidt has promised that the firm will simplify the process by which Android phone users agree to share their data. It follows questions in the US Senate about how much location information is stored by mobile handsets. Speaking in the UK at a conference on privacy, he also revealed that Google planned to offer web users more control over their online profile. Mr Schmidt insisted that the company took the matter \"very seriously\". Has this happened, or not? Stories from earlier this week suggest not. I'm Stephen Wolfram (Mathematica, NKS, Wolfram|Alpha, ...), Ask Me Anything &gt;&gt; Reddit Fascinating and absorbing. Pretty much the first question: why aren't old versions of Mathematica made open source? His answer is smart. Apple's iPad 3 Launch Putting Squeeze on Freight Shipments from China - Mac Rumors One shipping representative told MacRumors last week that his freight broker in China has been scrambling to find space for his company's shipments, with shipping rates rising 20% in one week as Apple has snapped up available capacity at premium rates. Another shipping manager told us a similar story today, with his company being unable to find space with its usual carrier due to Apple's demand and having to scramble to find alternatives for moving products overseas. Seems incredible. Then again, if you're shipping millions of large-ish objects, perhaps so. Could Apple affect the Dry Baltic Index? At Google, advertising is crowding out search results &gt;&gt; Ed Bott Ed Bott: For years, Google was famous for its clean, uncluttered layout and its excellent search algorithms. Those days are long gone. Google gets 96% of its annual revenue from advertising. Search results produce no revenue. That has led to some tremendous distortions and a horrifying breakdown in the once-clean Google experience. I present Exhibit A, which I discovered thanks to Twitter. If you're signed in to your Google+ account and you search for pet meds, a little ad module appears at the top of the search results, with your email address already filled in. Less obvious outside the US, but just wait for the EC antitrust decision. Enable Start Orb and Start Menu on Windows 8 Consumer Preview | Windows 8 Beta One of the biggest changes in the Windows 8 Consumer Preview is the Removal of Start Orb along with the Good o'l Start Menu with it,a move which was said to be necessary to emphasize on the Metro UI and the new Start Screen Page with Tiles making it more touch friendly. But with many likings for the new Metro UI also come many dislikes as well.So for those who don't like to use the Metro UI and those who want to bring back the Start Button along with the Start Menu,ViStart is the way to go.It was initially designed for bring the Windows Vista's Start Menu to Windows XP,but it also works for the Windows 8 versions as well,thanks to the recent updates to the software. We can see the \"want the Start orb!\" \"You don't need it!\" wars being a feature of the next few years. (Thanks @rquick for the link.) Windows 8 Consumer Preview tip: use compatibility mode for driver installation &gt;&gt; Gadget Writing Tim Anderson: I have a Kodak ESP 725o network printer, and was trying to set it up on Windows 8 Consumer Preview. The setup software detected the printer OK, then gave a strange error: \"The application called an interface that was marshalled for a different thread.\" Hmm. The solution is to run the installer in Windows 7 compatibility mode. Doing this in Windows 8 takes a few steps. Presumably will be fixed by the time it's fully-fledged.

      "bodyText": "Lord Bell has said that he is continuing to pursue a management buyout of his eponymous PR agency, as profits at parent Chime's communications division fell 7% to \u00a369.2m in 2011. Overall, Chime group reported strong results for 2011, with pre-tax profits rising 16% to \u00a324.7m. Total revenues grew 8.7% to \u00a3326m as Chime's increasingly successful sports marketing operation offset a dip in performance in the PR division. The sports marketing division's revenue increased by 64% year on year. Chime chairman Bell and Piers Pottinger, the co-founders of Bell Pottinger, announced plans to buy back the parts of the PR division in conjunction with \"certain members\" of senior management. The buyout \u2013 which is thought to have focused on Bell Pottinger brands including Public Affairs, Sans Frontieres, Pelham Bell Pottinger and Issues &amp; Crisis and not other Chime-owned PR businesses such as Good Relations and Harvard \u2013 has not received the blessing of Sir Martin Sorrell whose WPP owns about an 18% stake in Chime. Sorrell argued recently that it sets a \"terrible precedent\" for the future of Chime group. However, Bell, perhaps best known as Margaret Thatcher's favourite PR man in the 1980s, said on Wednesday that he is continuing to pursue his plans. \"Discussions continue on the potential buyout of part of the public relations division which represents less than 10% of group profit,\" he said. \"A further announcement will be made in due course.\" Bell said that the PR division, the biggest in the group accounting for 44% of Chime's total revenues, had a \"satisfactory\" year. Revenues fell by almost 12% to \u00a3143m, primarily due to Bell Pottinger losing its biggest PR contract with the US government in November. Operating income fell 7% to \u00a369.2m, while operating profits fell 1% to \u00a317.5m. Chime said that the profit impact from the loss of the US PR contract was \"largely compensated\" by a major uplift in the sports marketing division. Sports marketing, which includes businesses such as Fast Track, has been growing rapidly driven by a number of acquisitions in markets such as Brazil ahead of the football World Cup in 2014 and the 2016 Rio Olympics. Sports marketing, which accounts for 25% of total revenues, increased its revenues by 64% to \u00a383m. Almost 28% of the revenue growth came from new acquisitions; on an underlying basis the existing businesses grew revenue by 19% year on year. The division, which accounts for 25% of total operating income, boosted its operating income by 36% to \u00a340m. On an underlying basis it grew 16%. Operating profit grew 38%, or 7% on an underlying basis, to \u00a37.7m. Bell said Chime's advertising and marketing division \u2013 which includes VCCP, the ad agency behind Comparethemarket.com's TV ads featuring meerkat Aleksandr Orlov \u2013 increased its revenue by 17% year on year to \u00a387.3m \u2013 27% of Chime's total. Operating income rose 17% to \u00a346.5m to account for 28% of the total. Operating profit grew 52%, or 48% on an underlying basis, to \u00a36.4m. \"In 2011 Chime has had its seventh successive year of growth in operating income, operating profit and margin,\" said Bell. \"We think this is an impressive achievement given the difficult economic conditions in 2011. The group is well positioned for the future with a very positive year ahead for sports marketing in particular.\" Chime has also announced four acquisitions with a total potential deal value in cash and shares up to 2020 of about \u00a333m. The group has acquired graphics and branding company McKenzie Clark for an initial consideration of \u00a3600,000 in cash in a deal potentially worth about \u00a34m if financial targets are met. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "In a world of perpetual festivals, how does any individual one assert and sustain itself? When Sprint began at Camden People's Theatre 15 years ago, London's theatre scene wasn't as crowded with festivals as it is now. Back then, there was Lift, the Mime festival, and Battersea Arts Centre's quaintly titled British festival of Visual Theatre. But these were far enough between to keep each one special. Now, there's a festival every other week, and a range of venues \u2013 such as Battersea Arts Centre and Soho Theatre \u2013 programmed to feel as much like a permanent festival as possible. So how do I make Sprint stand out? That was the question on my mind when, as my first main job since taking over at Camden People's Theatre last autumn (alongside my co-director Jenny Paton), I sat down to programme our annual festival of innovative theatre. What constitutes a festival? Is it just a concentrated shot of what our theatre does anyway?

The festival is programmed now \u2013 it starts on Friday 9 March\u2013 and I'm at the end of a journey that's less learning curve, more learning vertical line.

The more festivals that appear on the theatre calendar, the more appetite there seems to be for co-ordination. I programmed Sprint in isolation from other UK festivals \u2013 partly because I didn't know what I was doing, partly because there's a culture of uniqueness among festivals. Our festival \u2013 like our venue in general \u2013 already has a USP, which is its specific focus on emerging artists making adventurous theatre. But beyond that, why should a festival in London strain to be different from a festival in Birmingham or Bristol? Artists and local audiences may be best served by co-operation, not competition. Festivals are now \u2013 as venues have been over the past 10 years \u2013 wising up to the value of partnership. Distinctiveness will remain important, but you get that for free with the location (we've got spy stories unfolding on Camden streets), curatorial taste (how could I resist a show about Bigfoot?), and timing. It was serendipity, not a desire to be different, that brought us the great Kazuko Hohki's new show about, er, faecal incontinence \u2013 developed around the corner at University College Hospital, and ready just in time for our festival. And as for festiveness \u2013 well, we're hoping to generate it by filling not just our wee studio theatre, but our foyer, our basement (a speakeasy each weekend of the festival), our windows, and the streets and squares of our west Euston community. We haven't done as much of all that as we'd like. But that's what next year is for. In the meantime, it's exciting to explore, in our own small way, what events like Sprint can and should be in the age of the permanent festival.",

When <a href=\"http://www.cptheatre.co.uk/sprint.php\" title=\"\">Sprint</a> began at Camden People's Theatre 15 years ago, London's theatre scene wasn't as crowded with festivals as it is now. Back then, there was <a href=\"http://www.liftfestival.com/home\" title=\"\">Lift</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.mimefest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mime festival</a>, and Battersea Arts Centre's quaintly titled British festival of Visual Theatre.

Now, there's a festival every other week, and a range of venues \u2013 such as Battersea Arts Centre and Soho Theatre \u2013 programmed to feel as much like a permanent festival as possible.</p> <p>So how do I make Sprint stand out? That was the question on my mind when, as my first main job since taking over at Camden People's Theatre last autumn (alongside my co-director Jenny Paton), I sat down to programme our annual festival of innovative theatre.

Without the rules and laws, sanctions and taxes of the state, we would descend into a war of all against all. Evolutionary science and political economy \u2013 from Adam Smith and Thomas Hobbes, to Milton Friedman and Richard Dawkins \u2013 tell us selfishness is our default mode. What if they were completely wrong? Science increasingly suggests they are. Evidence from evolutionary biology and psychology, anthropology and game theory shows our uniquely sophisticated capacity for co-operation is at the heart of our evolutionary success. Science is telling us we are co-operators. We breed babies that develop slowly and need a lot of care. According to Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, professor of anthropology at the University of California, mothers in hunter-gatherer tribes needed help, especially from older women, to cope with child-rearing and to supplement the food brought back by hunters. The babies most likely to survive would have been good at eliciting support, showing pro-social tendencies and emotions. For most of human history the only sure way to get food on a regular basis was to be co-operative: if a hunter returned with nothing they would rely on sharing food brought in by other more successful band members. Richard Wrangham, professor of biological anthropology at Harvard, argues that we evolved large brains because our ancestors worked out how to cook food to make it more digestible and so to provide more energy. Hunting, cooking and eating together required tolerant temperaments and skills of co-operation. Michael Tomasello, the co-director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropolgy in Leipzeig, who has spent a lifetime studying altruism among babies, has found that infants willingly co-operate with people they do not know. They tend to share goods like toys and food; they help by fetching out-of-reach objects for people; they are helpful and informative, even with strangers. The Swiss economist Ernst Fehr has conducted thousands of experiments with people, called social dilemma games, to test their willingness to share money with other people. In general only 20% and at most 30% play these games selfishly; 50% to 60% play co-operatively. Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, the world's leading researchers into reciprocity, led teams to study co-operation among 16 of the last hunter-gatherer societies in the world and found that the closer we get to a state of nature the more co-operative we become. They summed up the new science of co-operation thus: \"Many economists, biologists and others will assert, as they have for at least a century, that altruism beyond one's immediate family members is highly exceptional and ephemeral. The experimental evidence of the last two decades tells strongly against that view.\" Our evolutionary success depends on our ability for complex problem-solving, from how to hunt giant mammoth together to organising mass healthcare services \u2013 and all complex problem-solving depends on co-operation. Martin Nowak, professor of biology and mathematics at Harvard, argues that co-operation is the hidden, driving force of evolution: \"Co-operation was the principle architect of 4 billion years of evolution. Co-operation built the first bacterial cells, then higher cells, then complex multicellular life \u2026Co-operation can draw living matter upward to higher levels of organisation. It generates the possibility for greater diversity by new specialisations, new niches and new divisions of labour. Co-operation makes evolution constructive and open ended \u2026 We need to do even more to create an environment where co-operation can flourish if we are to reap its creative benefits.\" These sciences are helping to show how co-operation can be sustained through norms of fairness, sanction against free riders, direct communication among co-operators and creating opportunities for people to acquire social standing by being co-operative. Co-operation \u2013 far from being quaint and anachronistic \u2013 could come to be seen as successful and modern, aspirational and dynamic. The web and social media are working in favour of co-operation, amplifying and reinforcing relationships. Sharing and co-operation are increasingly central to consumer culture \u2013 witness the rise of Groupon and airbnb. Collaboration and co-operation lie at the heart of our most innovative activities in science, culture and business. The reform of the welfare state hinges on breathing life back into its withered sense of reciprocity. The revival of politics probably rests on what the Canadian political philosopher Mark Kingwell calls co-operative citizenship: citizens learning to engage with one another to find solutions as much as with the government. New forms of co-operation will be needed at every level of our lives, from the global challenges of financial instability, climate change and resource depletion, to the growing recognition that most of what matters most to us \u2013 love, care, friendship, respect, trust \u2013 come from relationships. All of which leads to a simple prediction: the societies that succeed in the decades to come will be fair and relatively non-hierarchical because they will be better at co-operation that those are divided and unequal. \u2022 Charles Leadbeater is author of It's Co-operation, Stupid, published by the thinktank IPPR \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

He begins by contending that the business model of the tabloid press became so dependent on trashing reputations, whether of \"ordinary people\" or celebrities, politicians and people in public life, \"that it is now nothing other than a machine to convert harassment, intrusion, misery, sneering and mockery into cash. \"Anger and vindictiveness are its default settings. Papers sell on the depths of their inhumanity. Columnists are judged by the frequency and inventiveness of the offence they cause.\" He scorns tabloid editors' claims to absolute and unqualified freedom of expression and a right to expose corruption and hold power to account. \"This is hypocrisy of the most snivelling sort. Worse, it pollutes the arguments we need to protect the best in journalism by trying to justify the worst. Yes, it's vital that we protect our freedom of expression. Yes, it's vital that no-one can be silenced when they call power to account or root out corruption or ruthlessly examine and embarrass powerful institutions. Yes, it's vital that we insist power is exercised transparently and that we can hold it to account. And it's vital that we protect the right of the press to do all of these. But the truth is, that's not what the tabloids do. For every MPs' expenses exclusive \u2013 not a tabloid exclusive incidentally \u2013 there are thousands of 'ordinary people' harassed, vilified, libelled. For every court battle that lifts injunctions to expose evil corporations \u2013 not something the tabloids have ever indulged in \u2013 there are dozens to assert the tabloids' right to report that yet another dog has bitten yet another man. Or rather, another premiership footballer has been caught with his shorts off. Defending the tabloids' right to do what they want to who they want how they want is nothing to do with protecting free speech. Or protecting the press.\" Marsh goes on to point out that the tabloids are \"mightily powerful institutions\" which are among \"the least accountable and transparent\", defending their lack of accountability and transparency in the name of \"protecting sources\". In a lengthy diatribe, he lays into Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre for \"a performance before Leveson that was defiant, disingenuous and in denial... It was a chilling insight into a warped mindset.\" He analyses the libellous coverage unfairly meted out to Christopher Jefferies, the innocent man caught up in the murder inquiry into his tenant, Joanna Yeates. He moves on to the treatment of the parents of Madeleine McCann and the mother of Hugh Grant's baby. Then he asks a series of questions of the what-can-be-done variety. \"What do we require a free press to do on our behalf? And what do we want it not to do in order to be a civilised player in a civilised society? \"How do we make sure we have a free press that really can expose MPs' greed; corporate corruption and crime; police, doctors social workers and the rest who really are incompetent? There's no easy answer and it would be foolish to pretend there is. But one thing I do know. The last people you want to make or monitor any set of rules are the crooks themselves... The tabloid press has proved beyond any doubt that it can't be trusted to regulate itself. But if the answer doesn't lie in regulation, where might it lie? Marsh's ideal, despite the difficulties, would be \"a new legal settlement for the media. A clear body of law that applied to people and businesses committing deliberate acts of journalism... \"And one of the key characteristics of that body of law would be that all parts of it had a clear, public interest defence... Tied to this new body of media law, however, we need rapid, low-cost resolution... The one thing the PCC did, in fact, do well was to organise speedy mediation and resolution, particularly in the local press... But there should be more. Even with more rational media law, we'd still need an editors' code... underpinning an independent, statutorily established regulator whose main job would be to investigate, rather than simply resolve, breaches of the code... Newspapers could choose whether to be inside a system like this or not. Inside, you'd sign up to the whole package \u2013 complete with pubic interest defence and limited costs and damages. Outside, you could do what you liked \u2013 much as the tabloids do now. Except for this. Outside would be very, very cold and hostile indeed. You'd have no public interest defence.

      "bodyText": "Increased use of shared services across government was intended to cut costs and make the public sector more efficient. So far, however, it has failed to deliver value for money, says a report by the National Audit Office (NAO). The drive towards shared services began with the Gershon review in 2004, which recommended greater sharing of back office functions such as IT, HR, payroll and finance. Since then, eight shared service centres have been built. The NAO examined five of them: the centres used by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Ministry of Justice, Department for Transport (DfT), Research Councils UK and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It found the cost of building and operating the centres ran \u00a30.5bn over the allocated \u00a31.4bn budget, while the \u00a3159m of savings that the centres were expected to generate by the end of 2010-11 didn't materialise. Only one of the centres broke even, while the two remaining centres generated a cost of \u00a3255m. The centres remain under-used, with three not attracting the customers they had expected and two having potential spare capacity of 50%, which the NAO attributes to the voluntary, rather than mandatory, nature of shared services within departments. The enterprise resource planning (ERP) used by the centres came in for particular criticism from the spending watchdog, with the software described as \"complex\" and \" proven to be expensive\". \"With a lack of scale and usage in some centres, limited standardisation and low levels of automation, the cost to establish, maintain and upgrade these systems is high. As a result two centres intend to totally re-implement their existing systems with simpler, standard ERP software, despite the significant investment already made. All the centres acknowledge they need to simplify and standardise their systems and reduce customisation,\" the report says. The NAO also raises questions about the procurement of the ERP products used by the centres, four of which run Oracle and one SAP. \"We found the centres are only using a small part of the capability their ERP systems provide. The systems are capable of handling larger volumes of transactions and more services and it is not clear why such expensive solutions were bought. Other smaller and simpler accounting packages were not looked at to see if they may have provided the required functionality,\" the report says. The services offered by the centres are also overly customised to suit users, limiting their ability to generate efficiencies, the report says. \"By insisting on overly customised processes [customers] have not acted as intelligent customers. Most have not optimised benefits from the implemented solutions or adequately worked with the centres to understand the cost drivers. Departments and agencies have been hampered by the lack of detailed cost information and benchmarks. The centres have prioritised increasing the number of customers or implementing new software, rather than working with existing customers to drive efficiency,\" it adds. In June 2011 the Cabinet Office launched a revised shared services strategy, which the NAO predicts will solve the ongoing issues with shared services if \"managed, resourced and supported appropriately\". The strategy will see the creation of two independent centres, created from the existing DWP and DfT facilities, by June 2014, along with the establishment of other standalone centres. The NAO recommends that the Cabinet Office should seek greater powers to mandate shared services, issue guidance for departments on overcoming barriers to adopting shared services and establish reliable cost and performance benchmarks. A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office said: \"The NAO report shines a light on inefficiencies dating back to 2004 which the government is already taking steps to address \u2013 we have already announced a new approach to shared services that will cut through the complexity in the current system and save money for taxpayers.\" For customers, the NAO advises setting out clear accountability for managing all costs and benefits associated with shared services, and ensuring they are scruitinised and benchmarked. \"Most customers of shared service centres have not acted as intelligent customers. Customers should implement a professional management function to ensure shared services comply with service level agreements and reduce costs, by for example, standardising services, managing demand and improving service delivery,\" it adds.

      "bodyText": "Television advertising revenue in the UK increased by 2.2% year on year to a record \u00a34.36bn in 2011, as advertisers such as internet giants Google and Groupon ploughed millions into TV commercials for the first time. The UK TV market was buoyed by 887 new or returning advertisers \u2013 defined as those who have not run commercials for at least five years \u2013 according to research conducted by TV marketing body Thinkbox and Nielsen Media Research. New advertisers, which accounted for \u00a3113m or 2.6% of TV ad spend in the UK, included Google, Groupon, Ann Summers, Jimmy Choo and British Airways new frequent-flyer brand Avios. Google, which has historically shied away from TV and brand advertising, spent \u00a35.2m on TV ads in the UK last year. This represents 23% of the \u00a322.5m that Google spent in the UK on all forms of advertising \u2013 including internet, outdoor, press and radio \u2013 according to figures from Nielsen. Google's ad spend in the UK has increased more than seven-fold in just three years. In 2009 Google spent \u00a33m, in 2010 this more than doubled to \u00a36.6m and then almost quadrupled to \u00a322.5m last year. The rocketing ad spend is a far cry from Google's previous ethos with Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive, admitting on Twitter that \"hell has indeed frozen over\" when the search giant purchased one of the world most expensive ad slots to run a commercial during the Super Bowl in 2010. Notable work in the UK last year includes ad agency BBH's campaign for Google Chrome featuring Jamal Edwards, the teenager behind urban music site SBTV, which ran with the strapline \"The web is what you make of it\". Google UK also uses M&amp;C Saatchi for marketing and advertising communications around the issue of privacy and has a prolific in-house ad department called Creative Labs. Tess Alps, the chief executive of Thinkbox, said the rise in UK TV ad revenue was an encouraging performance particularly given that in 2010 the market rose 16% year on year in the recovery following the downturn, making a further rise last year all that more difficult to achieve. \"The strength of linear TV advertising investment reflects commercial TV's record viewing and the further acknowledgement by advertisers of its ability to create business profit,\" said Alps. The top spending category remained retailers, followed by the entertainment and leisure sector, and finance. Telecoms companies increased ad spend by 28.8% year on year, travel and transport rose 27% and the never-ending battle between comparison websites saw TV ad spend rise 21.5% year on year in this sector. In January, Thinkbox produced its annual TV viewing report, showing UK viewers watched an average of four hours and two minutes of television per day. Each viewer watched an average of 47 TV ads per day in 2011. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

In 2009 Google spent \u00a33m, in 2010 this more than doubled to \u00a36.6m and then almost quadrupled to \u00a322.5m last year.</p> <p>The rocketing ad spend is a far cry from Google's previous ethos with Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive, admitting on Twitter that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/ericschmidt/status/8738388895\" title=\"\">\"hell has indeed frozen over\"</a> when the search giant purchased one of the world most expensive ad slots to run a commercial during the Super Bowl in 2010.</p> <p>Notable work in the UK last year includes ad agency BBH's campaign for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKpvwlSGOI\" title=\"\">Google Chrome featuring Jamal Edwards</a>, the teenager behind urban music site SBTV, which ran with the strapline \"The web is what you make of it\".</p> <p>Google UK also uses M&amp;C Saatchi for marketing and advertising communications around the issue of privacy and has a prolific in-house ad department called Creative Labs.</p> <p>Tess Alps, the chief executive of Thinkbox, said the rise in UK TV ad revenue was an encouraging performance particularly given that in 2010 the market rose 16% year on year in the recovery following the downturn, making a further rise last year all that more difficult to achieve.</p> <p>\"The strength of linear TV advertising investment reflects commercial TV's record viewing and the further acknowledgement by advertisers of its ability to create business profit,\" said Alps.</p> <p>The top spending category remained retailers, followed by the entertainment and leisure sector, and finance.</p> <p>Telecoms companies increased ad spend by 28.8% year on year, travel and transport rose 27% and the never-ending battle between comparison websites saw TV ad spend rise 21.5% year on year in this sector.</p> <p>In January, Thinkbox produced its annual TV viewing report, showing UK viewers watched an average of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/24/television-viewing-peaks-hours-day?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">four hours and two minutes</a> of television per day.

      "bodyText": "The Republican presidential race looks likely to drag on into the summer after Mitt Romney won his crucial Super Tuesday showdown with Rick Santorum in Ohio but failed to break decisively away from the pack. He was denied a sweeping victory in the 10 states at stake on Super Tuesday mainly by a stronger-than-expected showing by Santorum, who won three states. With more than 90% of the votes counted, CNN called Ohio for Romney. Super Tuesdays historically have proved to be decisive, but not this one. Instead, the biggest day of the campaign highlighted the fractured nature of the modern Republican party and the lack of enthusiasm among the party grassroots for Romney. Romney, in his post-election speech in Boston, where his campaign organisation is based, pinpointed that the race was becoming increasingly about the delegates' tally. \"Tonight we are counting up the delegates for the convention \u2013 and counting down the days until November. We're going to take your vote, and our victory, all the way to the White House,\" he said. Exit polls showed voters split between those who thought Romney the more credible candidate to beat Barack Obama in the November White House race and those who regard Santorum as the more steadfast conservative. In what has been one of the craziest races in recent US political history, Super Tuesday offered another night of tension and drama. As well as Ohio, Romney took Vermont, Massachusetts, Idaho, Virginia and Alaska. Santorum, fighting on a small budget against Romney's tens of millions of dollars, took Tennessee, North Dakota and Oklahoma, and ran Romney a close second in Ohio. Adding to the mix, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, as expected, won his home state, Georgia, his first win since South Carolina in January. Although Gingrich failed to make an impression anywhere else, the Georgia win will encourage him to remain in the race, at least for a few more weeks. Santorum, speaking at a rally in the small Ohio town of Steubenville, said: \"As it looks right now, we're going to get at least a couple of gold medals and a whole parcel full of silver medals. We have won in the west, the midwest and the south, and we're ready to win across this country.\" He had repeatedly confounded the pundits, he said. \"We've done races all over this country, against the odds, when they thought: 'Oh, OK, he's finally finished.' We keep coming back.\" In the long run, though, Romney emerged the stronger. Defeat in Ohio would have been a disaster for him, but he has demonstrated again, as he did in Michigan last week, that when facing Santorum one to one, in a tight race, he can beat him. When the closeness of the Ohio result, in which Santorum led for long stretches of the night, has been forgotten, what matters is that Romney will have taken about half of the 419 delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday while his opponents will be awarded much smaller proportions. From now on, in the race is about delegate count. It is the delegates who will choose the nominee at the party convention in August. Santorum, buoyed by his Super Tuesday wins, has no intention of dropping out. He planned to be out campaigning on Wednesday in the forthcoming Kansas and Mississippi contests. Gingrich said he too planned to continue in the campaign and brushed aside calls from the Santorum camp to bow out so conservatives could unite around a single anti-Romney canddidate. John Brabender, a senior campaign adviser to Santorum, said Santorum had only narrowly lost Michigan last week and Gingrich had picked up 7% in that primary. \"We could have used those votes that night,\" Brabender said. Before Super Tuesday, Romney had 203 delegates. After Super Tuesday, he can expect to about double that, winning around 200 more. Santorum had 92, but in spite of his strong showing he has, with the Alaska result still to come in, gained only about 60. Gingrich had 33 before Super Tuesday but, because of the size of Georgia, gains a further 70. Paul had 25 before Super Tuesday and will add only a modest number to that tally. A candidate needs 1,144 delegates, half of those attending the Republican convention in Florida in August, to seal the nomination. Santorum and Gingrich have been unable to match Romney in terms of money and organisation, running ramshackle outfits. As a result of poor organisation, neither Santorum nor Gingrich were on the ballot in Virginia, leaving just Romney and Paul to fight it out. Even before a vote was counted in Ohio, Santorum had already lost 18 of Ohio's 66 delegates through incompetent organisation. Even as polling was under way in the Super Tuesday states, Romney's supporters, who have already been airing ads in the Mississippi and Alabama contests, announced they were looking beyond next week and had bought ads for the contests after that, in Illinois and Louisiana.",

      "bodyText": "BBC managers insist technical problems at its new Salford headquarters that have affected regional news programme North West Tonight will not delay the move of BBC Breakfast in April. New computer systems in news have caused what some sources claim is a \"huge systemic problem that won't be fixed for some time\" at the BBC's new northern base at MediaCityUK in Salford, while technology crashes in other departments are affecting shows such as Songs of Praise. Some insiders claim staff working on regional show North West Tonight, which will share a studio with BBC Breakfast, are \"having to work under almost intolerable conditions\". However, the BBC journalism development editor, Rod Beards, said problems are just \"snags\" that will be ironed out ahead of Breakfast's launch. BBC Breakfast's transfer from London to Salford has hit the headlines already after presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins decided to leave the show rather than move. Hollins is among those who criticised the decision, claiming it was a \"political\" strategy rather than an economic one. Some celebrity PRs and bookers also criticised the move, saying it will prove difficult to find time for their clients to go to Salford and more Breakfast interviews will end up being conducted \"down the line\" from BBC studios in London. So with all eyes on the new BBC Breakfast, which is due to begin broadcasting from Salford shortly after Easter, managers are trying to \"rescue the situation\" and fix the technical problems, according to insiders. However, Beards played down the seriousness of the technical problems. \"For me this is routine project stuff that is going on. It is low level snags that need fixing. What we are trying to ensure is that we're not endangering the output,\" he said. He declined to say when Breakfast will launch in Salford but said the technical issues will not affect the start date, which is thought to be around the week beginning Easter Monday. \"There will be some annoyance to staff when something like the backup server falls over ... it means double staffing,\" Beards said. \"But we will not be delaying the launch of Breakfast. This is fairly normal when you have new technology that some things will not work and we need to sort them out.\" BBC's children's and Vision departments have already had technical problems since the move. In January a major computer crash led to shows such as Songs of Praise having to be edited by companies outside the BBC. According to sources there are ongoing issues with the corporation's beleaguered new high-tech Digital Media Initiative, also known as Fabric, which is supposed to make production easier but is still being implemented and has cost millions of pounds. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

It is low level snags that need fixing. What we are trying to ensure is that we're not endangering the output,\" he said.</p> <p>He declined to say when Breakfast will launch in Salford but said the technical issues will not affect the start date, which is thought to be around the week beginning Easter Monday.</p> <p>\"There will be some annoyance to staff when something like the backup server falls over ... it means double staffing,\" Beards said. \"But we will not be delaying the launch of Breakfast. This is fairly normal when you have new technology that some things will not work and we need to sort them out.\"</p> <p>BBC's children's and Vision departments have already had technical problems since the move.</p> <p>In January a major computer crash led to shows such as Songs of Praise having to be edited by companies outside the BBC.</p> <p>According to sources there are ongoing issues with the corporation's beleaguered new high-tech <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/divisions/digital-media-initiative\" title=\"\">Digital Media Initiative</a>, also known as Fabric, which is supposed to make production easier but is still being implemented and has cost millions of pounds.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "Marie Nixon I'm in a bad mood. This is a great shame as until very recently I was excited, enthused, even a little giddy with possibility. I was ready for Women of the World, planned to attend Sphinx Theatre's event, attended top drawer lectures by human ideas factories Beverley Skeggs and Owen Jones, had top discussions with my Clore mentor Nick Kenyon, and was working up to mentor some folks myself. Through marrying my experiences, chats with incredible people and lots of relevant reading, I felt I was getting to grips with some of the challenges for women in the arts, hell, in the world, and starting to have a crack at sorting them out. I'd also spent careful hours putting together a research proposal for the AHRC. In layman's (my) terms I want to know why more working class people, particularly women, don't make it into leadership positions in the north east's cultural sector. This seems especially weird to me as 1) we make up the majority of the population here and 2) art should reflect and resonate with the experiences, times and lives of its audience. I'm looking forward to finding some answers. Anyway, I checked my watch, and yes, it's the year of our Lord 2012. Good, I thought, we're getting somewhere here. And yet now I'm faintly depressed. The catalyst has been a review my band The Cornshed Sisters received this week in a respected magazine \u2013 a 'proper' one with glossy pages. On reading it I felt like a Project TicToc scientist of 60s TV classic Time Tunnel, stumbling confusedly into a regressive, less enlightened and frankly less sensible era. An era where artists with the temerity to have ladybits are slighted and demeaned by playground level critical analysis (\"urg, girls\"). In this case, the review substituted slipshod references to cultural figures in whom little value is placed (The Spice Girls, Townswomen's Guild, Nora Batty) for an actual review. Through its use of poorly valued cultural symbols, it's clear in its message. For Spice Girls read throwaway, ephemeral; for Townswomen's Guild read small, parochial, marginal, insular; for Nora Batty read northern, battleaxe, old and perhaps the ultimate crime, unsexy. This was a review to put us in our place. Sadly there was no Time Tunnel. This is the here and the now. And unfortunately, I've been here before. In the old days, people struggled with the idea of my old group Kenickie as a regular, everyday, music-making group. The fact that we were northern and women really confused them. My band mate (now Dr) Emma Jackson wrote something very clever and insightful about it here (\"Classy\", towards the end). I expect a rougher ride this time around as I've had the nerve to get old. Sadly, examples of this kind of poor behaviour are common outside the media-driven, image-focused world of commercial music. I have lost count of the times I've been asked to put the coffee on or presented with the names of meeting attendees as though I'm the note-taker, not the chair or, and this may be one of the worst examples, found my own good ideas rebranded as those of someone else better fitting the 'leader' image. It's time to stop being polite about these things, to stop gracefully rising above these slights. Will you join me in the graceless rejection of this insidious sexism? \"You're being a bit sexist now and I'd like you to stop\", we should say to the perpetrators, or simply: \"stop being an idiot.\" There is a point in most unfinished projects where the end seems frustratingly far from sight and the equality project is most certainly unfinished. As Mama Cass once sang: \"The darkest hour is just before dawn.\" I hope that's why things seem a bit bleak now, and that's there's a great big shiny dawn about to burst over the horizon. At the moment I feel not, but then I am in a bad mood. I'll get past this one review. I don't care if people think the music on the record is terrible. I do care about me, my friends and other women in the creative world being cruelly, idiotically and counterproductively diminished. We mustn't stand for that. Marie works across the north of England at the Arts Council England and also performs with her band The Cornshed Sisters \u2013 follow her on Twitter @mariemarie0 Claire Hodgson \"What are you putting up with?\" It's a simple question, but it has had quite a rippling effect through my life. The list of personal stuff comes easily: not enough time with my partner, not being able to fit into my old clothes after having my daughter, not having enough time on my own (although a social beast, I love being alone). These are issues other parents will identify with. The clothes thing can seem a bit superficial, but stored in those clothes is my identity (I have indeed been wearing the same style since 1989). More profound is the way this question has led me to think about my work. What am I putting up with in the projects I lead? What effect is that compromise having on the final product and the participants? In the context of work, \"putting up with\" might mean: not having enough artists for a particular project; not having a warm rehearsal venue; poor profile for the project; insufficient support; not enough money to do the gig justice. In short, when I settle, the quality of my work suffers. Why am I reflecting on these questions? Because I've been challenged to do so. You see, I have an executive coach. Everyone on the Clore fellowship does. I chose Lee Chalmers because her business is called Authentic Living. It sounded appealing and she seemed to have a great deal of experience across a number of sectors. It turned out to be a good choice. If I had to sum up the coaching experience in one word, it would be \"clarity\". The first session focused on money, and proved revelatory. Although coaching does sometimes consider past experience, in the main it looks towards the present and future. She helped me to identify the stories I had picked up in my past about money, and how I was playing these stories out in the present. When I walked out, I was clear that I had a block around creating surplus (saving). I was always earning just enough and sometimes not quite enough. Like many people, I was unclear of exactly how much I needed each month. Facing the issue head on helped me to clarify what types of work I could take on and what I would have to turn down (or take on and ask for more money). Asking for more money is something women are statistically less likely to do than men. Four months later, I have some savings. But I have to remember \u2014 this isn't just about me. That my personal money situation has been reflected in the fortunes of my company Diverse City is no coincidence. We generate enough but not the surplus that would give us time to regroup, develop, research. No time for strategic thought, just delivery. Not having a surplus means you can't refill your tanks. This refuelling is essential in the arts world and I will build it into the company structure. Creativity needs nurturing, space and time to experiment. That is why the current funding climate is so hard. In short, coaching has made me ask: \"What might be possible in this situation?\" When I think to myself \"that's not possible\", I now ask \"why do I think that?\" Is it because I can't be bothered? (Answer: rarely.) Because it means I have to do something new that challenges me? (Sometimes.) That it will mean I will have to ask people to help me out? (Mostly.) This process has made me understand that being a leader means asking for help when you need it. Help can mean practical support, so you can get more done, or simply advice and guidance. Successful leaders do not pretend they have done something before when they haven't. Being a leader, by definition, means you are often trying something new and taking a risk. Can you do Clore if you are a parent of young children? Absolutely. Can you do it if you work part time? Absolutely. But only if you learn how to say: \"I'm trying to achieve this rather big project \u2013 do you want to help me out?\" I am going to be asking a few government departments, MPs and funders this question in the next few weeks in relation to a rather a big Olympic arts project.

      "bodyText": "The challenge of re-engaging disillusioned young people kept recurring at last night's 'community conversation' on Manchester's street violence last August. Speakers from an audience of 150 or more returned repeatedly to the challenge, debating the extent of alienation, its causes both real and imagined, and the differing effectiveness of official and community attempts to change it. It was a purposeful meeting at the city's Friends' Meeting House but also polite, with an atmosphere encouraging involvement; speakers from the floor included a schoolboy in his early teens who wanted to know if minor crime, such as smashing a bottle, was more seriously punished during the troubles than ordinarily. Seriously bad relations between disaffected youth and police were repeatedly raised, but Chief Supt Russ Jackson of Greater Manchester police got an interested hearing as he used statistics to question broad-brush claims about a 'new' type of previously uninvolved young troublemaker, or dice weighted against ethnic minority participants. Neither stood up to the facts, of whites and people with criminal record forming the large majority of those brought to book. Engagement was the core; and although another young participant, 14-year-old Monica Williams, described before the meeting how her school organised lessons, many questions were raised about getting the disillusioned a platform. There was derision about young Mancunians being ferried to London for photo-opportunities with leading politicians, including Cabinet ministers, while the challenge of genuinely involving them went unmet. The Guardian got ticked off too \u2013 politely again - for failing to give time to a group of young people from the city who arrived unannounced with a petition calling for positive media coverage. Ruth Ibegbuna of the youth charity Reclaim agreed that teenage logic wasn't always easy to follow, and civic engagement could be more of a slogan than genuinely at the top of young people's wish-lists. But she described the practical challenges \u2013 a teenage discussion group priced out of places to meet, which started at \u00a3200 for a room for three hours; or the failure of the police to transfer the friendliness of officers' primary school visits to those at high schools. Coun Pat Karney, who took refuge in Marks and Sparks during an ugly phase of the trouble, and Mags Casey, who interviewed many Manchester participants and their families, left no doubt about the 'exciting' allure of sudden lawlessness, especially to people feeling alienated, suddenly seeing events just down the road on TV and heading off to join in. But there was general agreement that rioting, throughout the UK's long history, has always indicated genuine grievances and problems which need sorting. That is the next step in Manchester, where further work is under way on both research and engaging people in the findings so far and the lessons they suggest. A similar community conversation takes place tonight, Wednesday 7 March, in Salford, at St Sebastians Community Centre, 1 Douglas Green 6-8pm. All info on the Reading the Riots study here.",

Neither stood up to the facts, of whites and people with criminal record forming the large majority of those brought to book.</p> <p>Engagement was the core; and although another young participant, 14-year-old Monica Williams, described before the meeting how her school organised lessons, many questions were raised about getting the disillusioned a platform. There was derision about young Mancunians being ferried to London for photo-opportunities with leading politicians, including Cabinet ministers, while the challenge of genuinely involving them went unmet.</p> <p>The <em>Guardian</em> got ticked off too \u2013 politely again - for failing to give time to a group of young people from the city who arrived unannounced with a petition calling for positive media coverage. </p> <p>Ruth Ibegbuna of the <a href=\"http://www.reclaimproject.org.uk\">youth charity Reclaim </a>agreed that teenage logic wasn't always easy to follow, and civic engagement could be more of a slogan than genuinely at the top of young people's wish-lists. But she described the practical challenges \u2013 a teenage discussion group priced out of places to meet, which started at \u00a3200 for a room for three hours; or the failure of the police to transfer the friendliness of officers' primary school visits to those at high schools.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.manchester.gov.uk/councillors/72/patrick_karney\">Coun Pat Karney</a>, who took refuge in Marks and Sparks during an ugly phase of the trouble, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/reading-the-riots-blog/2011/oct/10/reading-the-riots\">Mags Casey,</a> who interviewed many Manchester participants and their families, left no doubt about the 'exciting' allure of sudden lawlessness, especially to people feeling alienated, suddenly seeing events just down the road on TV and heading off to join in. But there was general agreement that rioting, throughout the UK's long history, has always indicated genuine grievances and problems which need sorting.</p> <p>That is the next step in Manchester, where further work is under way on both research and engaging people in the findings so far and the lessons they suggest. A similar community conversation takes place tonight, Wednesday 7 March, in Salford, at St Sebastians Community Centre, 1 Douglas Green 6-8pm.

But news that permanent placements rose for the second month running and at the fastest pace for nine months was tempered by evidence that the market for temporary jobs deteriorated, according to the monthly REC/KPMG report on jobs. Agencies' temporary and contract staff billings fell slightly for the third month running. Also there were signs that those gaining employment were settling for lower pay with salaries falling for the first time since the end of the recession in 2009. \"Put alongside recent news from the Office for National Statistics which suggested that the last unemployment figures represented the smallest rise in almost a year and there may be signs that the market is displaying early signs of recovery,\" said Bernard Brown, head of business services at survey publishers KPMG. \"Yet cautious optimism must remain the watchwords because the picture is not as rosy for temporary positions.\" Demand for staff rose at the fastest pace in four months during February, the report said. Nearly all sectors increased their demand for permanent staff in February, with IT and computing posting the fast growth followed by engineering and construction. The only sector where demand for permanent staff fell was hotel and catering, according to the report, which uses survey data provided by recruitment consultancies. Despite the rise in vacancies, most economists still expect unemployment to rise further this year from 8.4%, already the highest since 1995. Against that gloomy outlook, KPMG said there was a \"real prospect of continued downward pressure\" on wages this year. \"Given the ongoing squeeze many are feeling as costs go up on the high street, it appears that the price of permanent employment is lower take-home pay, but this is an inevitable consequence of a competitive, yet still fractious, market,\" said Brown.",

      "bodyText": "A radical new solution to funding community regeneration projects is being piloted in the ex-mining town of Glyncoch, South Wales. While most donors will never even visit, the reach of Twitter allows popular projects to tap into new funding sources. Can Twitter build a community centre? Stephen Fry seems to think so. He's backed a campaign to crowd-fund a community centre in a town battered by disappointment for seven years. Fry called on his 4 million Twitter followers to pledge \"the price of a cucumber sandwich\" to rescue the project that already has 96% of its funding from grants. But these grants expire on 30 March, so it's hoped that hundreds of people across the web will chip the final \u00a328k to make it happen. The community is using Spacehive.com to raise the money. Spacehive aims to shake up planning by allowing anyone to post projects to improve public spaces. Whether it's a community centre, park or a revamped high street, anyone can take the idea to market, raise funds and ensure it goes ahead. With the Spacehive model, funders only pay if the project actually goes ahead. The aim is to widen the pool of funding for projects so that everyone from locals to Stephen Fry's Twitter followers in New Zealand can contribute. With councils facing continued austerity, this could come as welcome relief. The ideal result will be a collaboration of the private and public sector, with individuals, businesses and councils all chipping in to get projects funded. Can the model work? Communities are not awash with cash. But although the downturn is making it harder to secure funding from traditional sources for projects, demand still exists and there is money out there. We just need smarter, more efficient ways of tapping into it if we want to get things built. The open funding system Spacehive uses was co-developed by Deloitte and a team of planning experts, and is backed by the Royal Institute of British Architects and British Property Federation. Its model is similar to the American crowd-funding site Kickstarter.com, but is specifically designed to help communities deliver projects in the built environment. While the technology is new, the notion of crowd-funding public spaces is not. Britain has been doing it since Victorian times. Many of our greatest public spaces \u2013 including several large parks in Manchester \u2013 were funded through public subscription, as were plenty of statues and monuments in our towns and villages. We hope to revive that tradition, empowering communities to transform where they live by voting for projects they like with their wallets. Research has shown a real appetite for this. And if there was anything positive to take away from the summer riots it was the strength of community spirit that rose to the surface in their aftermath. Some would argue this feeling of camaraderie only surfaces in traumatic times, but I disagree. Most people really value their communities and are keen to improve where they live. People across the country are bursting with great project ideas - whether they're sports club owners keen to build new facilities, talented architects with a vision for reviving an unloved street, or any one of millions who are itching to improve something in their area. But the current merry-go-round of planning meetings, consultations, fundraising rallies and paperwork often means the best ideas choke on bureaucracy before any dirt is shifted. There's a gap between nice ideas and action \u2013 funding. Spacehive cuts to the chase by letting people share the cost of the improvements they want. In return you know that if your project gets funded, you'll actually get what you asked for. Suddenly we can get playgrounds built for \u00a350 per family, high streets revitalised for \u00a31,000 per local trader, and wetlands restored for \u00a380 per twitcher. It's a refreshing new way of doing things which is being tested right now in Glyncoch. A broad mix of funders have already pledged \u2013 from local families to a photographer in Vancouver. If they can raise the rest the centre will be built this summer, making a real impact on one of the UK's most deprived communities. Let's hope they make it.

      "body": "<p>A radical new solution to funding community regeneration projects is being piloted in the ex-mining town of <a href=\"http://www.glyn-coch.com/\" title=\"\">Glyncoch, South Wales</a>. While most donors will never even visit, the reach of Twitter allows popular projects to tap into new funding sources.</p> <p>Can Twitter build a community centre? Stephen Fry seems to think so. He's backed a campaign to crowd-fund a community centre in a town battered by disappointment for seven years.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/stephenfry\" title=\"\">Fry called on his 4 million Twitter followers</a> to pledge \"the price of a cucumber sandwich\" to rescue the project that already has 96% of its funding from grants. But these grants expire on 30 March, so it's hoped that hundreds of people across the web will chip the final \u00a328k to make it happen.</p> <p>The community is using <a href=\"http://spacehive.com/\" title=\"\">Spacehive.com</a> to raise the money. Spacehive aims to shake up planning by allowing anyone to post projects to improve public spaces. Whether it's a community centre, park or a revamped high street, anyone can take the idea to market, raise funds and ensure it goes ahead.</p> <p>With the Spacehive model, funders only pay if the project actually goes ahead. The aim is to widen the pool of funding for projects so that everyone from locals to Stephen Fry's Twitter followers in New Zealand can contribute. With councils facing continued austerity, this could come as welcome relief.</p> <p>The ideal result will be a collaboration of the private and public sector, with individuals, businesses and councils all chipping in to get projects funded.</p> <p>Can the model work? Communities are not awash with cash. But although the downturn is making it harder to secure funding from traditional sources for projects, demand still exists and there is money out there. We just need smarter, more efficient ways of tapping into it if we want to get things built.</p> <p>The open funding system Spacehive uses was co-developed by <a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/index.htm\" title=\"\">Deloitte</a> and a team of planning experts, and is backed by the <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/\" title=\"\">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bpf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Property Federation</a>. Its model is similar to the American crowd-funding site <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" title=\"\">Kickstarter.com,</a> but is specifically designed to help communities deliver projects in the built environment.</p> <p>While the technology is new, the notion of crowd-funding public spaces is not. Britain has been doing it since Victorian times. Many of our greatest public spaces \u2013 including several large parks in Manchester \u2013 were funded through public subscription, as were plenty of statues and monuments in our towns and villages. We hope to revive that tradition, empowering communities to transform where they live by voting for projects they like with their wallets.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=2010%20survey%20by%20open%20city%20showed%20that%2065.3%25%20believe%20they%20do%20not%20have%20enough%20of%20a%20say%20in%20their%20local%20built%20environment&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fopen-city.org.uk%2Fimages%2FOpen-City%2520neighbourhood%2520survey%25202010.pdf&amp;ei=_DNOT4u0COKx0QXGwLGeBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGA3lc5ijaBc7fxKRWWeu2U8wcrg&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Research has shown a real appetite for this</a>. And if there was anything positive to take away from the summer riots it was the strength of community spirit that rose to the surface in their aftermath. Some would argue this feeling of camaraderie only surfaces in traumatic times, but I disagree. Most people really value their communities and are keen to improve where they live.</p> <p>People across the country are bursting with great project ideas - whether they're sports club owners keen to build new facilities, talented architects with a vision for reviving an unloved street, or any one of millions who are itching to improve something in their area. But the current merry-go-round of planning meetings, consultations, fundraising rallies and paperwork often means the best ideas choke on bureaucracy before any dirt is shifted.</p> <p>There's a gap between nice ideas and action \u2013 funding. Spacehive cuts to the chase by letting people share the cost of the improvements they want. In return you know that if your project gets funded, you'll actually get what you asked for.</p> <p>Suddenly we can get playgrounds built for \u00a350 per family, high streets revitalised for \u00a31,000 per local trader, and wetlands restored for \u00a380 per twitcher.</p> <p>It's a refreshing new way of doing things which is being tested right now in Glyncoch. A broad mix of funders have already pledged \u2013 from local families to a photographer in Vancouver. If they can raise the rest the centre will be built this summer, making a real impact on one of the UK's most deprived communities. Let's hope they make it.</p> <p><em>Chris Gourlay is the chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://spacehive.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Spacehive.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "UK consumer spending edged up for the second month running in February, according to new figures fanning hopes that the economy enjoyed a modest bounce at the start of the year. Helping to allay fears that the UK had slipped back into recession, payment company Visa Europe said on Wednesday that consumer spending rose 0.2% on the month, adding to January's 0.2% uptick. Visa, which said transactions on its cards accounted for \u00a31 in every \u00a33 of UK spending, cautioned however that spending was down 1.3% on a less volatile three-month on three-month basis. On the year to the end of February, spending fell 1.7%. Steve Perry, commercial director of Visa Europe, said: \"February saw the first consecutive month-on-month increase in consumer spending since last July ... further bolstering confidence that the economy may be slowly returning to growth. \"However, the underlining trend revealed by the three-month on three-month data remains subdued, suggesting that we still have a way to go before we can talk of a full recovery.\" Behind the headline numbers was further evidence that people are increasingly turning to the internet to find bargains. Online spending rose 4.4%. There were also signs of higher spending on more discretionary items, with clothing and footwear up 7.4% and hotels and restaurants up 6.9%. A separate report suggests retailers are still struggling to raise prices against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence. Shop price inflation slowed to just 1.2% in February according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). The slowdown came as the non-food category turned deflationary for the first time in more than two years. Prices were down 0.7% on the BRC-Nielsen shop price index. BRC head Stephen Robertson said: \"While fuel and utility bills are eating up an ever bigger proportion of household budgets, many goods sold by retailers now cost less than they did a year ago. Clothing, electricals and furniture are all cheaper than at this time in 2011 as retailers respond to the squeeze on personal finances by cutting prices, reducing their own underlying profitability.\" Food prices meanwhile recovered somewhat to 4.2% from January's 19-month low of 3.7%, with the BRC blaming higher transport costs for the increase. The lobby group took the modest inflation rate as an opportunity to call on the chancellor, George Osborne, for help for businesses at this month's budget. \"When shop prices are up by just 1.2% there's even less justification for the eye-watering 5.6% business rates rise planned for April. Reducing this huge hike in trading costs should be a priority for the budget,\" said Robertson.",

As rumoured for several weeks, the town creation classic will be hitting PCs in 2013, and it seems the name will simply be Sim City rather than Sim City 5, suggesting something of a reboot for the series which revolutionalised gaming on its arrival in 1989. So what can we expect? A major graphical overhaul, of course. Development duties are being undertaken by the game's original creator, Maxis, using the proprietary GlassBox engine. The new tech will apparently allow cities to be personalised in intricate detail; a feature on the game in a German magazine recently suggested that players would be able to individually customise every building \u2013 and would even be able to spy on inhabitants as they are personally affected by boom or bust developments. At the very least, you'll be able to craft highly themed developments going for sleek financial mega cities or smoke-belching industrial zones. From the trailer released by EA, there certainly seems to be a wealth of intricate detail, with a realistic sports arena (showing Monster Truck events), power stations and skyscrapers crowding the skyline. It looks like you'll even be able to watch as your buildings are constructed by tiny workmen. EA has also mentioned that the game will include a multiplayer mode in which cities will stand side by side in interconnected regions. Participants will need to work together to develop renewable resources and deal with climate change, or compete greedily for resources and to hell with Mother Earth. Other than that, it looks like the structure will be familiar, with players taking on the role of mayor, attempting to guide his or her town to economic and cultural success. Apparently, however, the interface is going to be re-worked so that both newcomers and veterans will be able to hop straight in. Although Sim City has been a regular fixture on EA's release schedules over the last twenty years, the last major PC iteration was almost ten years ago; the more mainstream Sims franchise has taken a lot of the attention.

      "bodyText": "Peyton Manning's era at the Indianapolis Colts is expected to end on Wednesday, according to reports. However, there has been no confirmation from Rob Lowe as of yet. ESPN reported on Tuesday, citing anonymous sources, that the Colts plan to hold a news conference on Wednesday to announce the long-expected decision. Manning is expected to make an announcement at midday ET. Team owner Jim Irsay and Manning's agent, Tom Condon, did not respond to messages left by The Associated Press. Team spokesman Avis Roper said he could not confirm the decision or the news conference because Irsay was out of town and unreachable. Manning, who will turn 36 this month, missed the entire 2011 season after a third neck surgery. Before that, however, he had never missed a game in his previous 13 seasons in the NFL. The QB is owed a $28 million bonus which rewards his longevity with the club on Thursday, and with the Colts holding the top draft pick, they have apparently decided it is too risky and pricey to keep the four-time league MVP. The Colts are expected to use that top draft pick to sign Stanford QB Andrew Luck. After all, fans urged them throughout a woeful season to #SuckforLuck. Will West Wing actor Rob Lowe confirm the move before the press conference? He has previously predicted that Manning would retire. Manning led the Colts to Super Bowl glory in 2006 and in 2009 he brought the Colts to the edge of history with a 14-0 start. That season tailed away when Indy lost their last two regular season games and then to New Orleans in the Super Bowl. During the offseason, Manning had the first of his neck surgeries. After making an early playoff exit in the 2010 season, Manning underwent another neck surgery to repair a damaged nerve that was causing weakness in his throwing arm. Last July, Irsay signed Manning to a new five-year, $90 million contract extension that everyone expected would keep the QB in Indy for the rest of his career. But when the nerve did not heal as quickly as anticipated, Manning had two vertebrae fused together in September, a surgery that forced him to miss the first game of his career. There are still questions about how strong Manning's arm is. There is no doubt about the impact he's had on Indy's franchise over the past 14 seasons: He is the Colts' career leader in every major passing category, is one of only four players in league history to throw for more than 50,000 yards and is third all-time in touchdown passes (399). Manning is not short of money and will probably not be short of options. At least four teams with high draft picks are looking for QBs: the Cleveland Browns, Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins, Seattle Seahawks. Heisman winner Robert Griffin III is in the draft along with Luck. Another option is Green Bay Packers backup, and soon-to-be free agent, Matt Flynn. Would Manning move to NY to join the Jets and be in the same city as the little brother who has just overtaken him in the Super Bowl ring stakes? The Redskins might offer the most money.

      "body": "<p>Peyton Manning's era at the Indianapolis Colts is expected to end on Wednesday, according to reports. However, there has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/18/rob-lowe-peyton-manning-indianapolis-colts\">no confirmation from Rob Lowe as of yet</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7653897/sources-indianapolis-colts-part-peyton-manning-wednesday\">ESPN reported on Tuesday,</a> citing anonymous sources, that the Colts plan to hold a news conference on Wednesday to announce the long-expected decision. Manning is expected to make an announcement at midday ET.</p> <p>Team owner Jim Irsay and Manning's agent, Tom Condon, did not respond to messages left by The Associated Press. Team spokesman Avis Roper said he could not confirm the decision or the news conference because Irsay was out of town and unreachable.</p> <p>Manning, who will turn 36 this month, missed the entire 2011 season after a third neck surgery. Before that, however, he had never missed a game in his previous 13 seasons in the NFL.</p> <p>The QB is owed a $28 million bonus which rewards his longevity with the club on Thursday, and with the Colts holding the top draft pick, they have apparently decided it is too risky and pricey to keep the four-time league MVP.</p> <p>The Colts are expected to use that top draft pick to sign Stanford QB Andrew Luck. After all, fans urged them throughout a woeful season to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23SuckForLuck\">#SuckforLuck</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/RobLowe\">Will West Wing actor Rob Lowe confirm the move before the press conference?</a> He has previously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/18/rob-lowe-peyton-manning-indianapolis-colts\">predicted that Manning would retire</a>.</p> <p>Manning led the Colts to Super Bowl glory in 2006 and in 2009 he brought the Colts to the edge of history with a 14-0 start. That season tailed away when Indy lost their last two regular season games and then to New Orleans in the Super Bowl. During the offseason, Manning had the first of his neck surgeries.</p> <p>After making an early playoff exit in the 2010 season, Manning underwent another neck surgery to repair a damaged nerve that was causing weakness in his throwing arm.</p> <p>Last July, Irsay signed Manning to a new five-year, $90 million contract extension that everyone expected would keep the QB in Indy for the rest of his career.</p> <p>But when the nerve did not heal as quickly as anticipated, Manning had two vertebrae fused together in September, a surgery that forced him to miss the first game of his career. There are still questions about how strong Manning's arm is.</p> <p>There is no doubt about the impact he's had on Indy's franchise over the past 14 seasons: He is the Colts' career leader in every major passing category, is one of only four players in league history to throw for more than 50,000 yards and is third all-time in touchdown passes (399).</p> <p>Manning is not short of money and will probably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/feb/15/peyton-manning-indianapolis-colts-trade-options\">not be short of options</a>. At least four teams with high draft picks are looking for QBs: the Cleveland Browns, Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins, Seattle Seahawks. Heisman winner Robert Griffin III is in the draft along with Luck. Another option is Green Bay Packers backup, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/06/nfl-best-free-agents-agency-deals-2012\">soon-to-be free agent, Matt Flynn</a>. Would Manning move to NY to join the Jets and be in the same city as the little brother who has just overtaken him in the Super Bowl ring stakes? The Redskins might offer the most money. Which team would offer the best chance of a Super Bowl?</p> <p>An even bigger question is whether he will be fit? if not, he could move into coaching: maybe even at the Colts sometime. He is loved in Indianapolis and has had a good relationship with owner Irsay. Or he could always choose <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSuHQZjzJYY&amp;feature=player_embedded\">acting</a>.</p>",

Anonymous is a group of online \"hacktivists\" \u2013 individuals from around the world who engage in hacking attacks and other actions in the support of various causes, including targeting private security firms, Middle Eastern regimes, and the Church of Scientology. It's a loose collective of individuals with differing degrees of involvement: a core of active people with relatively sophisticated hacking skills, surrounded by others with limited knowledge or willingness to hack, and some who only participate in legal campaigns. What is LulzSec? LulzSec, short for Lulz Security, was a smaller and more organised offshoot of Anonymous who engaged in a series of attacks through 2011. Several individuals in Britain and Ireland were arrested as alleged members of the group, and its activities have subsequently waned. What sites were targeted? Anonymous rose to prominence after a string of \"denial of service\" attacks \u2013 a simple hack which temporarily takes websites offline \u2013 after the release of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks. It targeted politicians who had denounced the leaks, the US department of justice website, Visa and Mastercard for blocking WikiLeaks' payment streams, and others. The group had previously been better known for online pranks and mischief-making, particularly based from the internet bulletin board site 4chan. LulzSec took actions further, gaining access to servers of several large security companies and some publishers \u2013 including News International. Some details from these hacks were published online, while others, including an alleged 4GB of emails from the Sun, never materialised. Anonymous and LulzSec were accused of being responsible for the theft of tens of thousands of credit card details from the Sony PlayStation network, though this was vehemently denied by prominent members of both groups. In December Anonymous obtained a huge cache of emails from private intelligence provider Stratfor, which are currently being published via WikiLeaks. A hacker allegedly responsible for this attack is among the latest arrests. How were the individuals caught? If the information contained in unsealed indictments, and leaked in advance by US government officials, proves to be reliable, details on alleged members of the groups were revealed by one of LulzSec's most prominent members, known as Sabu. Often referred to as the leader of the group, Sabu was known to be older than many members \u2013 in his 30s \u2013 and a New York resident. He has been named in a US indictment as Hector Xavier Monsegur, and pleaded guilty to several hacking-related charges in August 2011. Since then, he has regularly been tweeting in support of Anonymous and related hacking groups, as well as being a frequent prescence in their chat channels. Is this the end for Anonymous? There is little doubt the arrests, or further charges against, suspected high-profile members comes as a blow. An even greater problem for a group constantly plagued with mistrust that individuals are working for the \"Feds\" is the suggestion that such a high-profile member has turned over evidence against other members. The group, however, operates loosely, with different alliances and friendships between members. The public chat channel used by the group had more than 500 people online for much of the day, with many venting frustration, vowing to continue or threatening revenge. The group has been written off before, only to emerge with a new and audacious hacking attack \u2013 though never after so dramatic a sequence of events.",

      "bodyText": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger felt a mixture of pride and regret after his Arsenal team came within a fingertip of a historic Champions League comeback on Tuesday night. Having lost the first leg 4-0 in Milan, Arsenal's chances were written off. No side had ever overturned a four-goal deficit in Europe's elite competition. But three first-half goals put the home team on the brink of greatness, only for Milan to hold on for an aggregate win. \"We are disappointed because we touched qualification,\" Wenger said. \"We had the chances. We didn't do it but we were very close. The players put in a faultless performance, with fantastic spirit, and you can only congratulate the whole team. It is a night when the players can be proud to play for this club. They put absolutely every effort in.\" Having soared into a 3-0 lead, the search for the crucial fourth goal proved fruitless and Milan were indebted to their goalkeeper, Christian Abbiati, whose fingertip save from Robin van Persie in the second half proved decisive. \"What can I say?\" Wenger mused. \"The one you would want the chance to go to is Van Persie. But he wanted to chip the goalkeeper. You have to give credit to Abbiati; he came up very quickly.\" Fatigue caught up with Arsenal, as well as a lack of options on the bench. Part of that is self-inflicted considering the attacking substitutes \u2013 Marouane Chamakh and Park Chu-young \u2013 are not seemingly made for the grandstand finish, though Wenger's frustration was that he could not bolster his midfield. \"I felt we suffered a bit in the second half physically because we had given a lot at Liverpool,\" he said. \"Overall I felt we did not have many opportunities on the bench in midfield. In the second half we had more problems to keep the ball than the first half. The regret I have is there. We missed a player like [Mikel] Arteta, who had concussion.\" The midfield impetus fell to Tomas Rosicky and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, both of whom drew praise from Arsenal's manager. He described Rosicky's contribution as \"outstanding\" and praised the Czech's influential contribution to the recent recovery that has seen Arsenal beat Tottenham, Liverpool and Milan in quick succession, scoring 10 goals in the process. A generally positive night had a sour ending as Wenger became embroiled in an altercation with the referee, the Slovenian Damir Skomina, in the tunnel. Wenger was upset with a performance in which he believed the official gave too many fouls in Milan's favour. Arsenal conceded 21 fouls to Milan's eight. \"I was not happy with the referee because he gave them many free-kicks in the centre of the park. \"Every single free-kick every time they went down it was for them. They sensed that very quickly on the pitch the players and they used it very well,\" he said. Skomina may include details of their exchange of views in his referee's report, which could land Wenger in some familiar hot water with Uefa. It had echoes of the row with officialdom as Arsenal were knocked out of the Champions League last season at Barcelona. On that occasion Wenger was furious that Van Persie had been sent off by the Swiss referee Massimo Busacca, who gave the Arsenal striker a second booking for shooting when play had stopped even though Van Persie claimed he had not heard the whistle. Wenger received a touchline ban for that episode. His bad feeling about the tie extended to another complaint about the pitch at San Siro, so if Uefa feels inclined to reprimand Wenger he would be inclined to say the feeling is mutual: \"It's maybe an easy excuse but I feel Uefa has a lot to answer for because when you arrive at 7.46 you get fined but you can play on a bad pitch and they don't say a word. I just feel it is part of the respect for people who pay their money and go to a football game to at least put the game in conditions where people can play football. That's what we try to do here. It's unacceptable from Uefa that they accept pitches like we had in Milan.\" At the end of it all, Arsenal's players looked shattered \u2013 physically and emotionally \u2013 and Wenger conceded it will be a tough job to pick them back up. \"It will be difficult because it is a big disappointment for the players. The team has grown together and hopefully we can finish the season in a strong way because there is no room for disappointment in the league. For us every point is a battle; that is what is in front of us.\"",

      "bodyText": "The editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, has been awarded the Goldsmith career award for excellence in journalism, one of America's most prestigious accolades. Rusbridger is the first non-American journalist to be honoured with the award, which is granted by the Harvard Kennedy School of Government as part of its annual prizes for political journalism. The career award recognises \"outstanding contributions to the field of journalism, and for work that has enriched our political discourse and our society\". Alex Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Centre on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, which sponsors the awards, said that under Rusbridger's leadership, \"the Guardian has grown in influence and prestige and now has a huge following in the United States\". He praised the way that Rusbridger had refused to be cowed in the investigation into the phone-hacking scandal involving News Corporation. By sticking with the story, he had \"shaken the Murdoch empire to its shoes. It demonstrated that one news organisation had the courage to report on another about a journalistic enterprise that was breaking the law \u2013 that is very rare.\" Accepting the award, Rusbridger said that he had enjoyed two important elements of luck \u2013 the luck to spend most of his career working for a newspaper that had no proprietor and was owned by a trust; and the luck to work with excellent journalists such as Nick Davies, who led the Guardian's reporting into the phone-hacking scandal. On phone hacking, he reflected that \"journalism is an immensely powerful force in society, and it is precisely because of its power that it merits scrutiny\". He said the most important lesson of the ongoing saga was the central role played by the reporter, the worker bees of the information world. Without reporters like Nick Davies, or Anthony Shadid and Marie Colvin \u2013 who died in separate incidents recently in Syria \u2013 Rusbridger said, \"we are in serious trouble\". He added that the phone-hacking story had taken \"serious reporting to expose journalism at its most reprehensible\". Rusbridger succeeds last year's winner of the career award, Frank Rich, the New York Times's former theatre critic and columnist who now writes for New York magazine. Previous winners include the investigative writer Seymour Hersh; the editor of ProPublica Paul Steiger; TV personalities such as Barbara Walters, Christiane Amanpour and Dan Rather; and Ted Turner, founder of the first 24-hour cable news channel CNN. The very first career award was presented in 1992 jointly to the creator of 60 Minutes, the late Don Hewitt, and Bob Woodward of Watergate fame. Rusbridger said that it was \"humbling to be bracketed with the distinguished American journalists on the roll call, several of whom were my personal heroes\". In addition to phone hacking, Harvard said that it had granted the award in recognition of Rusbridger's role in leading negotiations with Julian Assange over the publication of the giant treasure trove of WikiLeaks documents. In a broader sense, the award also marked Rusbridger's leadership in forging the direction of the Guardian's digital-first business strategy and commitment to \"open journalism\". \"His term at the helm has been filled with surprising turns and revelations, the most recent of which \u2013 open journalism \u2013 invites the world to participate in the journalistic process,\" Jones said.

The AP team was chosen from a pool of six finalists that also included ProPublica and the New York Times. Two book prizes were awarded for works on politics and press. Evgeny Morozov was granted the Goldsmith book prize for trade publications for his work The Net Delusion: the Dark Side of Internet Freedom, which sounds the alarm on the negative uses to which the internet can be put by dictatorships.

      "body": "<p>The editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, has been awarded the Goldsmith career award for excellence in journalism, one of America's most prestigious accolades.</p> <p>Rusbridger is the first non-American journalist to be honoured with the award, which is granted by the Harvard Kennedy School of Government as part of its annual prizes for political journalism. The career award recognises \"outstanding contributions to the field of journalism, and for work that has enriched our political discourse and our society\".</p> <p>Alex Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Centre on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, which sponsors the awards, said that under Rusbridger's leadership, \"the Guardian has grown in influence and prestige and now has a huge following in the United States\".</p> <p>He praised the way that Rusbridger had refused to be cowed in the investigation into the phone-hacking scandal involving News Corporation. By sticking with the story, he had \"shaken the Murdoch empire to its shoes. It demonstrated that one news organisation had the courage to report on another about a journalistic enterprise that was breaking the law \u2013 that is very rare.\"</p> <p>Accepting the award, Rusbridger said that he had enjoyed two important elements of luck \u2013 the luck to spend most of his career working for a newspaper that had no proprietor and was owned by a trust; and the luck to work with excellent journalists such as Nick Davies, who led the Guardian's reporting into the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>On phone hacking, he reflected that \"journalism is an immensely powerful force in society, and it is precisely because of its power that it merits scrutiny\". He said the most important lesson of the ongoing saga was the central role played by the reporter, the worker bees of the information world.</p> <p>Without reporters like Nick Davies, or Anthony Shadid and Marie Colvin \u2013 who died in separate incidents recently in Syria \u2013 Rusbridger said, \"we are in serious trouble\". He added that the phone-hacking story had taken \"serious reporting to expose journalism at its most reprehensible\".</p> <p>Rusbridger succeeds last year's winner of the career award, Frank Rich, the New York Times's former theatre critic and columnist who now writes for New York magazine. Previous winners include the investigative writer Seymour Hersh; the editor of ProPublica Paul Steiger; TV personalities such as Barbara Walters, Christiane Amanpour and Dan Rather; and Ted Turner, founder of the first 24-hour cable news channel CNN.</p> <p>The very first career award was presented in 1992 jointly to the creator of 60 Minutes, the late Don Hewitt, and Bob Woodward of Watergate fame.</p> <p>Rusbridger said that it was \"humbling to be bracketed with the distinguished American journalists on the roll call, several of whom were my personal heroes\".</p> <p>In addition to phone hacking, Harvard said that it had granted the award in recognition of Rusbridger's role in leading negotiations with Julian Assange over the publication of the giant treasure trove of WikiLeaks documents.</p> <p>In a broader sense, the award also marked Rusbridger's leadership in forging the direction of the Guardian's digital-first business strategy and commitment to \"open journalism\".</p> <p>\"His term at the helm has been filled with surprising turns and revelations, the most recent of which \u2013 open journalism \u2013 invites the world to participate in the journalistic process,\" Jones said.</p> <p>At the same ceremony, the $25,000 Goldsmith prize for investigative reporting was presented to the Associated Press for its groundbreaking probe into the New York police department's secretive and aggressive monitoring of Muslim communities.

They had gone out the Champions League but the manner of their departure seemed to lift their hopes of hanging on to fourth place in the Premier League and securing qualification for next season's competition. This was a tie of four halves. Arsenal lost the first one 2-0 and the second by the same score in Italy, won the third 3-0 at home and drew the fourth after Milan's players finally pulled themselves together. No doubt Massimiliano Allegri had used his half-time address to remind them of the humiliation suffered by their predecessors at Liverpool's hands seven years ago \u2013 although none of the Italian club's players on the pitch in Istanbul was involved on Tuesday night. As Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's players fought their way back to the brink of redemption, they gave substance to the Frenchman's frequent expressions of faith in their spirit \u2013 a quality long obscured, perhaps, but unearthed as they put the seven-times European champions on the rack. With those three unanswered first-half goals, they took a further giant step in the restoration of their battered pride, making the outcome of the tie seem less significant than the effect of their resilience on the club's morale. At the heart of their performance was a display by a teenager who will certainly have lodged a few thoughts in the mind of whichever coach is destined to take England to the finals of the European Championship this summer. Injuries to Mikel Arteta, Aaron Ramsey, Abou Diaby, Yossi Benayoun and Francis Coquelin, not to mention the long-term absence of Jack Wilshere, gave Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain a chance to start the match in the centre of midfield, alongside Alex Song and in front of the back four. Not quite the position just behind the front line that he says is the one best suited to his talents, but closer to it than the role on the wing in which he has been nurtured in his early days as a first-team player. Theo Walcott is still waiting for a similar opportunity to come in from the touchline, where he has been stationed since his arrival six years ago \u2013 like Oxlade-Chamberlain, a teenaged prodigy from Southampton. Walcott always believed himself to be better suited to a striker's role, and his goalscoring record with his original club and with England's Under-21s supported his contention, as did his brace of goals in the dramatic 5-2 win in the recent north London derby. He must have been envying the apparent ease with which the 18-year-old Oxlade-Chamberlain, five years his junior, has impressed Wenger with his precocious football intelligence. Oxlade-Chamberlain took hardly any time at all to make his mark against Milan. Only five minutes had gone when he moved out of his withdrawn starting position and turned up on the left wing, measuring a cross which was turned behind for a corner. He took it himself, whipping it in with his right foot and seeing it cleared for a second corner on the same side. Once again he delivered a telling effort which snaked in to meet the head of Koscielny, the centre-back's lateral run towards the near post conspicuously unhindered by the presence of defenders who stood and watched him score with the most straightforward of headers. But it was the quality of the corner that had made it possible, although Oxlade-Chamberlain could not quite manage to recreate the same damaging effect when offered two further opportunities from the same quadrant a dozen minutes later. Three minutes before the interval, with Arsenal now two goals up, came his most influential contribution to an extraordinary first half. Charging at an angle into the right-hand corner of the Milan penalty area, showing the kind of bullocking power and directness associated with Barcelona's Alexis S\u00e1nchez, he aimed his run towards the rapidly closing gap between Antonio Nocerino and Djamel Mesbah before sprawling to the ground under the Algerian left back's challenge. Robin van Persie hammered the penalty kick past Christian Abbiati with a force that redoubled the intensity of the message to his team-mates: they were right back in this contest with the chance of a reversal that would make the obliteration of Tottenham's 2-0 lead look like a rehearsal. Before his withdrawal with 15 minutes left, Oxlade-Chamberlain came close to producing an equaliser that would have sealed the miracle when he bore in from the left to strike a confident 20-yarder that curled past the angle of crossbar and far post. But he had already played his part in a display that surely put Arsenal back in credit with their followers, even the most sceptical of them given a glimpse of a brighter future.",

The interim first-team coach rested a number of senior players, with Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba starting on the bench for Tuesday night's game against Championship opponents, offering a clear indication that Chelsea's priority is to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League. Those omitted apparently accepted his decision. The win was secured only 48 hours after Villas-Boas's dismissal eight months into a three-year contract and, after a season undermined by dissent in the dressing room, provided timely relief. \"We are a happy family,\" said Di Matteo. \"Tonight everybody is happy. We won, we're through to the next round of the FA Cup and we're pleased. \"The players had to show a reaction on the pitch tonight and they'll have to again on Saturday because they have a responsibility towards the club, the supporters, our boss [Roman Abramovich] and everybody. It's for their own good as well. But we are all on board. \"The attitude was right, the commitment was right and it was important we showed we cared. We have to help each other and all 25 players in the squad need to play at their best. It was difficult after the last few days because we've lost a great guy, but we had to deal with it. This win was for Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. The players want to do it for the team, for the club, and that's what we have to do until the end of the season.\" Di Matteo, whose contract expires in the summer, declined to reflect upon his chances of securing the position full-time, with Chelsea's optimistic hopes of securing Pep Guardiola as Villas-Boas's replacement appearing even slimmer after it emerged the Barcelona manager may opt to take a year-long sabbatical if he leaves Camp Nou at the end of the campaign. The Spaniard is Abramovich's favoured candidate, his hopes fired by Guardiola's reluctance as yet to sign a contract extension with the European champions. Yet the 41-year-old has frequently spoken of fears of burnout and reports in Spain suggest he will seek a break from the game of up to a year if he decides to leave in the summer. Asked on Tuesday about Villas-Boas's dismissal, Guardiola said: \"He is a fantastic coach but we all know that in this business everything depends on results and not on our own capacity as a coach. Time is not something you get, but when you do this job you know that.\" Di Matteo said it was \"vital\" Chelsea finish fourth, with those prospects improved by news that John Terry could play at home to Stoke City on Saturday having featured on the bench here barely two weeks after surgery on a knee injury that had been expected to rule him out for up to six weeks. \"We have to build him up still,\" said Di Matteo. \"But he's determined to help the club and we're pleased to have him.\"",

      "bodyText": "This has been another season wrecked by in-fighting and managerial upheaval at Chelsea, but some lessons are clearly being learned. Before pinning up his first team-sheet for the club on Tuesday night, Roberto Di Matteo took Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba to one side and explained precisely why they would start this contest on the bench. The Italian's selection owed nothing to politics. Neither had it been dictated from above. \"It had nothing to do with bravery, either,\" said the interim first-team coach. Rather, the pair were being kept for the \"games that really matter\" in the weeks ahead. \"They were all on board,\" Di Matteo said. \"They know the targets we have to achieve.\" After the murmurings of complaint at a perceived lack of communication from above, a timely bout of diplomacy has broken out. The 2-0 victory at Birmingham City was a small step forward after weeks of regression, and was achieved against opponents whose resources had been stretched in the 47th game of their campaign, but Chelsea will be heartened by a hint of closure. Victories tend to unite, and there have been too few to celebrate in recent months. Those 3,220 visiting supporters crammed into the away end sought evidence of commitment and strength from those selected and, in the end, they could draw encouragement at glimpses of both. Far more onerous tasks await in the week ahead, but Chelsea have wrested back a sense of momentum. The away support's frequent chants that Roman Abramovich can \"sack who he wants\" suggested there is little sympathy lingering for Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. The Portuguese had omitted Lampard and John Terry for the visit of Bayer Leverkusen back in September, and had sought to explain to the pair his reasons only for those omitted to be baffled at their non-involvement. It is a reflection of the toils since, and perhaps the dressing down delivered by the owner after wielding the axe on Sunday, that they can accept there has been a shift in priorities since. It will be easier for the senior players to accept being \"rested\" now that Chelsea have given up their flirtation with long-term planning and reverted to familiar short-termism. Villas-Boas's sacking had been born of the real threat to this club's prospects of reaching the Champions League next season, the lack of an acceptable Guus Hiddink-style fire fighter having prompted the hierarchy to turn to an in-house stand-in. Yet Di Matteo has entered the final four months of his own employment \u2013 his contract expires at the end of June \u2013 with his brief to have a crack at Napoli next week but, above all else, finish in the top four. It was that reality that dictated the team selection on Tuesday night, the priority very much Stoke City's visit to Stamford Bridge on Saturday in the Premier League and not passage into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. There was no Michael Essien or Daniel Sturridge in the starting line-up either, with Ashley Cole injured and absent, though apparently fit enough to feature against Tony Pulis's team. If Villas-Boas had been making a statement by leaving out experienced campaigners in Naples last month, this was more a reflection of the reliance upon those same seniors to come. \"We have targets because we have to play Champions League next season,\" admitted Di Matteo, echoing the owner's demands. \"We don't like where we are in the table, and it'll be very tough to achieve what we want to achieve. But we have a duty to try. It's vital for us to finish fourth.\" Should he succeed his status among the support will soar yet further. The 41-year-old, flanked by his assistant Eddie Newton, had not taken charge of a game since his West Bromwich Albion team were dismantled 3-0 at Manchester City in February last year but looked the part here. There was a tweak to a 4-2-3-1 system from the start, an improvement after a pedestrian first half \u2013 albeit as Birmingham tired \u2013 and relief to be felt in victory. Juan Mata had already prodded the visitors ahead when Raul Meireles battered a second, prompting Di Matteo to embrace Drogba in celebration. The goalscorer, one of Villas-Boas's men, chose not to react quite so gleefully, briefly exposing the wounds of a traumatic week yet again. Stoke lie in wait, awkward opponents who will be eager to exploit nerves. Napoli, 3-1 up from the first leg, will be threatening on the counter next Wednesday. But this, at least, is a start.",

      "body": "<p>This has been another season wrecked by in-fighting and managerial upheaval at Chelsea, but some lessons are clearly being learned. Before pinning up his first team-sheet for the club on Tuesday night, Roberto Di Matteo took Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba to one side and explained precisely why they would start this contest on the bench.</p> <p>The Italian's selection owed nothing to politics. Neither had it been dictated from above. \"It had nothing to do with bravery, either,\" said the interim first-team coach. Rather, the pair were being kept for the \"games that really matter\" in the weeks ahead. \"They were all on board,\" Di Matteo said. \"They know the targets we have to achieve.\" After the murmurings of complaint at a perceived lack of communication from above, a timely bout of diplomacy has broken out.</p> <p>The 2-0 victory at Birmingham City was a small step forward after weeks of regression, and was achieved against opponents whose resources had been stretched in the 47th game of their campaign, but Chelsea will be heartened by a hint of closure. Victories tend to unite, and there have been too few to celebrate in recent months. Those 3,220 visiting supporters crammed into the away end sought evidence of commitment and strength from those selected and, in the end, they could draw encouragement at glimpses of both. Far more onerous tasks await in the week ahead, but Chelsea have wrested back a sense of momentum.</p> <p>The away support's frequent chants that Roman Abramovich can \"sack who he wants\" suggested there is little sympathy lingering for Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. The Portuguese had omitted Lampard and John Terry for the visit of Bayer Leverkusen back in September, and had sought to explain to the pair his reasons only for those omitted to be baffled at their non-involvement. It is a reflection of the toils since, and perhaps the dressing down delivered by the owner after wielding the axe on Sunday, that they can accept there has been a shift in priorities since.</p> <p>It will be easier for the senior players to accept being \"rested\" now that Chelsea have given up their flirtation with long-term planning and reverted to familiar short-termism. Villas-Boas's sacking had been born of the real threat to this club's prospects of reaching the Champions League next season, the lack of an acceptable Guus Hiddink-style fire fighter having prompted the hierarchy to turn to an in-house stand-in.

      "bodyText": "The healthcare needs of older care home residents are being neglected in some areas of the country, according to a review published by the British Geriatrics Society and the Care Quality Commission. Most primary care trusts plan healthcare for their local population by assessing the needs of people who live in their own homes \u2013 so elderly people living in care homes may be out of sight and out of mind. The BGS says PCTs \"do not accord sufficient priority\" to their health needs. There are 376,250 older people living in 10,331 care homes in England and many are frail and vulnerable, with more health needs than most of the population. Around 40% have dementia, many are on cocktails of medication, and the average lifespan when they get to a care home is one to two years. \"The NHS disengaged from care homes when they became private sector nursing homes,\" said Prof Finbarr Martin, BGS president and co-author of the report, Quest for Quality. \"The NHS disengaged except for the statutory responsibility to provide GPs. \"Care home residents have potentially become disenfranchised from a lot of community health services they would expect to get if they were in their own homes. There is an assumption that they are taken care of. The NHS, if it is about patient-centred care and equitable access, has to look at care home residents and meet their needs.\" If the health needs of this vulnerable elderly population are not properly met, they end up in hospital instead, he said. Data on the healthcare provided to residents was collected by the CQC, which has the job of monitoring standards in care homes, but analysed by doctors from the BGS. They found that the amount of NHS care offered to people varied widely. Elderly residents had access to a geriatrician who could take an overview of their complex age-related health problems in only 60% of PCTs, the analysis shows. The residents needed a whole range of medical services, including mental health teams, dietetics, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, podiatry, continence, falls and tissue viability (dealing with wounds, pressure sores and ulcers). Only 43% of PCTs made all of these available to care home residents. Where the services were available, it could take a long time for an elderly person to be seen \u2013 sometimes as long as 18 weeks, which could lead to a deterioration in health. \"The fault in many cases is not with care homes but with those responsible for ensuring that the NHS plays its part in ensuring that healthcare needs of residents are met,\" says the BGS. It wants local health service commissioners to agree clear service specifications with hospitals and other providers. \"It is evident that while there are pockets of excellent NHS care, such as in Sheffield, Leeds or south Manchester, there are striking geographical differences,\" said Martin. \"It is unacceptable to leave people waiting for over three months to receive treatment that could significantly improve their quality of life, especially when you consider that the average life expectancy of an older person entering a care home is between one and two years. \"It is time that commissioners and health service planners matched their obligations to ensure that the healthcare needs of this vulnerable group are adequately met.\" The CQC also looked at how staff in a small sample of care homes dealt with the health needs of residents. They found good practice in most cases in identifying residents' medical needs and planning, but there were also problems. Thirty-five per cent of homes said they \"sometimes\" had difficulties getting medicines to residents on time, and only 38% of care homes said GPs made routine visits, while 10% paid the GP surgeries to visit. Under the health changes, the CQC no longer has responsibility for monitoring the work of commissioners. The British Geriatric Society says it is concerned to know \"who is looking out for the needs of this very vulnerable group of older people\".",

      "bodyText": "LEFT ON THE SHELF \"I know teams these days tend to wear even a new away kit at the first opportunity at home as a form of advertising,\" says Simon Horner, \"but has there ever been a kit that, due to a lack of colour clashes, has never been worn?\" While there were a whole multitude of shirts produced in the 90s that should never have seen the light of the day due to their eyeball-bleeding ugliness, Fiorentina's was perhaps the only one banned on political grounds. It took until December of the 1992-93 season before anyone noticed that the club's away kit included (presumably unintentional) swastikas. The kit was quickly withdrawn. \"Fiorentina and the manufacturers, Lotto, would like to underline that the optical effect [of a swastika image] is purely a matter of chance,\" culpa mea-ed the club in a statement. Of course, Fiorentina actually played in that kit \u2013 which doesn't answer Simon's question \u2013 but Jon Waite brings us news of kits that never saw competitive action beyond a seven year-old winger down the park. \"The FA produced a sky blue version of the 1990 World Cup shirt (as famously modelled by Barney Sumner in the World in Motion video) that was never worn in a fixture,\" says Jon. \"A different sky blue third kit was worn once in a qualifier in Turkey a year later when Dennis Wise scored the winner.\" Jon also nominates QPR's third kit from the 1989-90 season, which was a jazzy black and orange number \u2013 their away kit was red and black and the lack of colour clashes meant it was left mouldering on the dressing room shelves. They also had an unused third kit in 1991-92, which will be familiar to fans of a certain Glasgow club. \"It has been long rumoured that this kit was nixed by two senior professionals at the club, Ray Wilkins and Alan McDonald,\" says Jon. \"Wilkins was still revered at Rangers from his time as a player there and McDonald was an east Belfast boy, long time Rangers fan and Northern Ireland captain. Both allegedly refused to wear the shirt for fear of upsetting friends in high places.\" UM, BONGO? \"With all the talk of upcoming TV rights deals, it got me wondering: what is the strangest host broadcaster of a football match?\" wonders Kath Taylor. You can watch the FA Cup on Facebook and you could even have thrilled to Holland 2-1 Albania in 2006 on this very site. But in September 2007, you could have caught Fiorentina - again - on the Italian adult channel ContoTV for \u00a35 up front or \u00a310 on the night. \"Yes, we are a porn broadcaster,\" said executive Marco Crispino after securing an exclusive deal to broadcast the Viola's Uefa Cup game against Groningen. \"But why shouldn't we do this? OK, Sky don't show porn but then that's their problem, not ours. Italians like their hardcore.\" There was a thrilling climax to the game too: Fiorentina won 4-3 on penalties. Any more for any more? Email the usual address. AGE AIN'T NOTHING BUT A NUMBER \"Who is the oldest player to have featured in the Champions League?\" poses Kevin Barnett. According to Uefa, fortysomethings Alessandro Costacurta (40 years and 213 days), Edwin van der Sar (40 years and 211 days), David Weir (40 years and 211 days too) and Dany Verlinden (40 years and 117 days) are all eclipsed by the Lazio goalkeeper Marco Ballotta, who appeared for the Biancocelesti in the 3-1 defeat against Real Madrid on 12 December 2007 at the ripe old age of 43 years and 253 days. \"When I was young I was told to work hard to improve; now I'm older I'm told to work even harder because of my age,\" said Ballotta, who retired the following summer before strapping his boots back on as a striker with Prima Categoria outfit Calcara Samoggia the next season. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"The memorable 1961 British Home Championship yielded an astonishing 40 goals from six matches,\" wrote Erik Kennedy in 2008. \"Has another tournament ever bettered this goal ratio (6.66 goals per game)?\" It has indeed been bettered - more often than not at the South Pacific Games, which, as several Knowledge enthusiasts pointed out, have long provided a rich goal-scoring seam. In 1963, when the inaugural event was held in Suva, Fiji, 49 goals were scored over six matches, an average of 8.17 per match. This whopping tally owed much to Tahiti's 18-0 victory over the Solomon Islands in the bronze medal match. As Jostein Nygard and Sean DeLoughry wrote to tell us, the net bulged even more frequently at the 1971 tournament, held in Tahiti. The hosts' 30-0 Group A win over the Cook Islands, who were also on the wrong end of a 16-1 drubbing by Papua New Guinea and a 15-1 defeat by Fiji, set the tone for an event in which 103 goals were scored in 10 games. That's an average of 10.3 goals per game. Leo White pointed to the 109 goals scored in Oceania Group One qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, producing a return of 10.9 goals per match. And finally, Hamzah Khan informed us that the 2006 Viva World Cup, the bi-annual competition organised by the Nouvelle F\u00e9d\u00e9ration-Board for teams unaffiliated to Fifa, produced 57 goals in six matches - an average of 9.5 per game. \u2022 For thousands more questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive. CAN YOU HELP? \"I notice that Preston North End are having to play nine games in March,\" writes Gordon Butler-Smith. \"Whilst this is above average, I doubt it has made it into the record books. What is the most games a team has had to play in a calendar month?\" \"Spurs' Andros Townsend is a promising talent and I've noticed he has now gone on loan to eight different clubs, meaning he's now played for nine different league teams at the ripe old age of 20. Surely that is somewhere near a record?\" asks John-Paul Pierrot. \"Neale Cooper being back at Hartlepool got me thinking about his first game in charge in his first spell in 2003, when four players making their league debuts scored for us (Strachan, Robinson, Robson and Nelson) against Peterborough,\" notes David Jolly. \"What's the record for the most newbies scoring in one game?\" \"I was recently watching a BBC programme about the region of Dagestan where Anzhi Makhachkala play,\" begins Manas Phadke. \"During the programme one of the people being interviewed by the reporter mentions the regional football league in Dagestan, which is based on Islamic principles, and does not have referees on the pitch.

But in September 2007, you could have caught Fiorentina - again - on the Italian adult channel ContoTV for \u00a35 up front or \u00a310 on the night. \"Yes, we are a porn broadcaster,\" said executive Marco Crispino after securing an exclusive deal to broadcast the Viola's Uefa Cup game against Groningen. \"But why shouldn't we do this? OK, Sky don't show porn but then that's their problem, not ours. Italians like their hardcore.\" There was a thrilling climax to the game too: Fiorentina won 4-3 on penalties.</p> <p>Any more for any more? <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">Email the usual address</a>.</p> <h2>AGE AIN'T NOTHING BUT A NUMBER</h2> <p><strong>\"Who is the oldest player to have featured in the Champions League?\"</strong> poses Kevin Barnett.</p> <p>According to Uefa, fortysomethings Alessandro Costacurta (40 years and 213 days), Edwin van der Sar (40 years and 211 days), David Weir (40 years and 211 days too) and Dany Verlinden (40 years and 117 days) are all eclipsed by the Lazio goalkeeper Marco Ballotta, who appeared for the <em>Biancocelesti</em> in <a href=\"http://www.kewego.co.uk/video/iLyROoaftnRp.html\" title=\"\">the 3-1 defeat against Real Madrid</a> on 12 December 2007 at the ripe old age of 43 years and 253 days. \"When I was young I was told to work hard to improve; now I'm older I'm told to work even harder because of my age,\" said Ballotta, who retired the following summer before strapping his boots back on as a striker with Prima Categoria outfit Calcara Samoggia the next season.</p> <h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2> <p><strong>\"The memorable 1961 British Home Championship yielded an astonishing 40 goals from six matches,\"</strong> wrote Erik Kennedy in 2008. <strong>\"Has another tournament ever bettered this goal ratio (6.66 goals per game)?\"</strong></p> <p>It has indeed been bettered - more often than not at the South Pacific Games, which, as several Knowledge enthusiasts pointed out, have long provided a rich goal-scoring seam. In 1963, when the inaugural event was held in Suva, Fiji, 49 goals were scored over six matches, an average of 8.17 per match. This whopping tally owed much to Tahiti's 18-0 victory over the Solomon Islands in the bronze medal match.</p> <p>As Jostein Nygard and Sean DeLoughry wrote to tell us, the net bulged even more frequently at the 1971 tournament, held in Tahiti. The hosts' 30-0 Group A win over the Cook Islands, who were also on the wrong end of a 16-1 drubbing by Papua New Guinea and a 15-1 defeat by Fiji, set the tone for an event in which 103 goals were scored in 10 games. That's an average of 10.3 goals per game.</p> <p>Leo White pointed to the 109 goals scored in Oceania Group One qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, producing a return of 10.9 goals per match. And finally, Hamzah Khan informed us that the 2006 Viva World Cup, the bi-annual competition organised by the Nouvelle F\u00e9d\u00e9ration-Board for teams unaffiliated to Fifa, produced 57 goals in six matches - an average of 9.5 per game.</p> <p><em>\u2022 For thousands more questions and answers, </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\" title=\"\"><em>take a trip through the Knowledge archive</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h2>CAN YOU HELP?</h2> <p>\"I notice that Preston North End are having to play nine games in March,\" writes Gordon Butler-Smith. \"Whilst this is above average, I doubt it has made it into the record books.

      "bodyText": "Payday lenders should be forced to limit the rolling over of loans, stop allowing customers to switch from one lender to another, and to share information about their customers with other lenders, the business, innovation and skills committee has recommended. In a report \u2013 which described the payday lending and debt management industry as opaque and poorly regulated \u2013 the influential committee said the government should outline a timetable within six months for deciding whether control of consumer credit will be transferred from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a new regulator replacing the Financial Services Authority. One of the FCA's first duties should be to address payday lenders' use of continuous payment authorities \u2013 payment instructions that cannot be ended by the borrower \u2013 unless lenders commit to stop using them. The committee's chairman, Adrian Bailey MP, said: \"During these difficult economic times, increasing numbers of people up and down the country \u2013 not least some of the most vulnerable members of our society \u2013 are relying on the provision of consumer debt management services and payday loans to make ends meet. \"And yet this industry remains opaque and poorly regulated. Despite a government consultation that ended almost a year ago, little has been done to remedy the situation.\" Payday lenders offer short-term loans to borrowers, typically up to a maximum of \u00a31,000. But interest rates and charges are high \u2013 APRs can reach as much as 16,000% \u2013 and lenders have been accused of targeting low-income borrowers who often end up rolling over their borrowing and accruing large debts. One of the OFT's frustrations in regulating credit companies is that it can take years from the point of deciding to revoke a licence, to getting through the appeal process, to stopping a firm from lending. The committee has called for a fast-track procedure introduced to suspend credit licences where businesses have failed to adhere to the rules. It also said higher licencing fees should be put in place for higher risk credit businesses, and the regulator should also be given the power to ban harmful products. Bailey said: \"Payday loans, by their very nature, appeal to those in serious financial need, some of whom will have low levels of financial literacy. We must be certain that this industry adheres to the highest standards \u2013 either through the codes of practice that are currently being developed or, failing that, by the new regulator.\" The OFT announced an investigation of payday lenders last week, saying it would visit 50 major companies and survey industry and consumer organisations to determine whether companies were complying with the Consumer Credit Act and its guidance on irresponsible lending. Neil Munroe, a director of credit reference agency Equifax, says payday lenders had already approached his company for information about sharing data about customers, \"and the interest has heightened since announcement of the OFT review\". Sharing data about customers would enable payday lenders to check that they are not lending irresponsibly to people who have multiple loans and who are rolling debt over from one payment period to the next. The data could also be made available to mainstream lenders such as high street banks, helping to rehabilitate the credit records of higher risk borrowers who repay payday loans on time. However, about 200 lenders are believed to be offering payday loans, many of which are trying to maximise profits until increased regulation makes the UK an unattractive business environment. Sarah Brooks, director of financial services at Consumer Focus said: \"As the committee has highlighted, the [OFT] rules themselves are not stringent enough to ensure payday lenders are lending responsibility and checking their customers' ability to repay loans. \"The payday loan industry has had the chance to put its own house in order but has failed to stamp down on irresponsible lending. In the meantime, consumers, often those on the lowest incomes, are losing out. \"We would urge the government to take account of these sensible, proportionate and considered recommendations and ensure that they are introduced quickly.\" The report stopped short of recommending a cap on charges, on the grounds that it could reduce availability of credit to those who need it most.",
