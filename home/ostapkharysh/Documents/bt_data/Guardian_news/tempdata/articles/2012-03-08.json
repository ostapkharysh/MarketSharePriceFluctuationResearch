      "bodyText": "Ofcom has stepped up its investigation into whether James Murdoch is a \"fit and proper\" person to sit on the board of BSkyB, forming a project team to examine evidence of phone hacking and corrupt payments emerging from the police and the Leveson inquiry. The media regulator set up a dedicated group of seven or eight staff under the name Project Apple at around the turn of the year as part of an assessment that is also taking in whether News Corporation is a fit and proper controlling investor in the satellite broadcaster. If Ofcom concluded that either Murdoch or News Corp were not appropriate owners, the regulator could revoke Sky's licence to broadcast in the UK, forcing it to switch off its channels, unless Murdoch stepped down from the board or News Corp sold its 39.1% stake. The existence of Project Apple emerged following a freedom of information disclosure by Ofcom in response to questions from the Financial Times. Board meeting minutes released by Ofcom show that members discussed the existence of the project on 24 January and that the regulator's general counsel had \"compiled files of relevant advice and evidence\". It is understood the Ofcom officials are liaising with the Metropolitan Police's Weeting and Elveden teams investigating hacking and bribery allegations \u2013 and studying evidence given to the Leveson inquiry on press standards. Ofcom's work is still at an early, or assessment stage, but guidance issued by the regulator makes it clear that it could make a ruling on the \"fit and proper\" status of Murdoch or News Corp ahead of the conclusion of any criminal trials. Although Murdoch last week stepped down as executive chairman of News International, the owner of the Sun and the Times, the 39-year-old is determined to remain as the head of BSkyB. He took over from his father as chairman at the end of 2007, having spent the previous four years as chief executive. However, Murdoch faces a number of challenges to his continuing chairmanship of Sky. In addition to Ofcom's inquiry, his stewardship of News International will be judged as part of a wider inquiry into phone hacking at the News of the World by MPs on the culture, media and sport select committee. Their final report is due later this spring. Sky declined to comment on the developing Ofcom investigation, but insiders insisted the company was relaxed given that the regulator had an ongoing duty to ensure that any broadcaster passes the fit and proper tests as laid out in law. The company believes that Ofcom's position has not altered since Ed Richards, its chief executive, wrote to three Lib Dem MPs in July of last year to say that it was \"continuing to gather and analyse information\" from the Met and elsewhere. Meanwhile, the solicitor acting for Rebekah Brooks, the former News International chief executive, accused the Leveson inquiry into phone hacking and media ethics of presiding over a \"spectacular failure\" in allowing a senior Scotland Yard officer to give evidence about the arrest of Sun journalists over alleged illegal payments to public officials. Stephen Parkinson, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Sue Akers' comments could threaten the arrested Sun journalists' right to a fair trial. Parkinson, the head of criminal litigation at Kingsley Napley, said: \"Those of us representing the current and former journalists, particularly at the Sun, who bore the brunt of the prejudicial comments, will inevitably make the point that publicity of this kind does not fade from the memory.\"",

      "bodyText": "Are you helping to stop Joseph Kony? Kony 2012, a video by advocacy group Invisible Children about the mass-murdering and child-abducting leader of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), has been viewed more than 50m times. The goal is to make the elusive warlord a household name and keep pressure on governments to bring Kony to justice. Oprah, P Diddy, Rihanna and other celebrities are all on board, along with teenagers and other socially conscious people, fired up and ready to accomplish their mission: Stop Kony. Sadly, however, a wet blanket looms. There is no question that the LRA has been one of the most horrifying armed forces in the past half century. But while the video urges spreading the word, signing a pledge, buying an action kit of Kony 2012 bracelets and posters, and of course donating to Invisible Children, it's hard to understand how this will aid the current slow chase of Kony and his forces through some of the most intractable terrain in the world. US military advisers have been helping the Ugandan army track the LRA since October, and Invisible Children wants to keep pressure on the US to maintain or improve that assistance. But as there has not been a whisper of possibly withdrawing this support, raising it as the reason for urgency seems slightly odd. Beyond this quasi-straw man, the most immediately problematic part of Invisible Children's video campaign is the simultaneous success and failure of Kony 2012 in raising awareness. Uganda and Kony are trending on Twitter but does awareness mean a basic understanding that goes beyond Kony's name? Only briefly, and 15 minutes into the video does the narrator, Invisible Children co-founder Jason Russell, mention that the LRA has left northern Uganda, and he doesn't say when. So you could forgive the thousands of eager tweeters crying out for action to stop the non-existent violence in northern Uganda now. But can you forgive Invisible Children for glossing over this? Maybe Invisible Children, which has shown itself to be an expert in raising awareness about the LRA (on Oprah twice!), did not do a good enough job explaining the LRA's regional expansion. Perhaps this is a harder task with the followers of celebrities than your more motivated university do-gooders. Or maybe Invisible Children decided that as its most powerful footage highlighted the very worst of Kony's terrorising children in northern Uganda, introducing confusing borders and less well-known places such as the Central African Republic would lose the audience and was not worth cutting time from the bouncing bracelet-wearing students outside the US capital. This leads to another worrying aspect of the Kony 2012 campaign. The arc of the video tells you that before, no one cared but, thanks to technology and Invisible Children, everyone can now take the necessary action to earn Kony the infamy and arrest or death he deserves. But since Invisible Children as an organisation began with a few north Americans stumbling into a conflict they didn't know existed and then resolving to help the child victims by making a movie, the base level of great white saviourdom is already high. Implying that finally now, by getting the word out about Kony via celebrities, bracelets and social media, can the LRA be ended plays into this narrative of white rescuers coming to help poor Africans and totally ignores the efforts, good and bad, by Ugandans to fight the LRA for 25 years. I belong to a discussion group of hundreds of Ugandan journalists, and so far only one has been willing to stand up and say this campaign is a good thing (and mainly because it might help more people find Uganda on a map). Nearly everyone else finds Kony 2012 self-aggrandising, patronising and oversimplified. As someone who, like the Invisible Children founders, loves and cares deeply about Uganda, perhaps most worrying to me is defining the image of Uganda in the minds of these millions of video viewers as a place of perpetual conflict and strife. Thursday, some of my Ugandan friends pointed out, was International Women's Day and attention to the many positive things to celebrate about the progress of Ugandan women were overwhelmed by attention to Kony 2012. On a darker note, Uganda also has many serious problems: a president in power for 26 years, millions in stolen funds and missing medicine, oil wells soon to begin flowing (with the potential for further corruption) and one of the world's youngest populations facing high rates of inflation and rising unemployment. Like many who know more than just one household name connected to Uganda, I worry that these important and more complicated issues will be overwhelmed by the half-informed outcry over the LRA and Uganda will, for millions, still be connected to one of the most terrible times in its history. And, of course, to the nice Americans who came to help. We should stop Kony, and Invisible Children as an organisation and Kony 2012 as a campaign are intended to further this goal. But not all well-meaning efforts are flawless and, rather than being depicted as cynical nay-saying, criticism should be embraced and addressed rather than rejected. If there were a referendum on whether or not Joseph Kony should be hunted with all available resources until he is arrested or killed, it would certainly pass. But translating millions of video views to change on the ground in eastern and central Africa is much harder than the social media outpouring of concern (and congratulation about that concern) would lead you to believe.

The Old Testament is replete with stories of men like King Solomon who had 700 wives and 300 concubines. And the New Testament is generally populated by single men and women whose domestic arrangements have little in common with the model of Christian marriage that is now being aggressively defended by Cardinal Keith O'Brien and others. Indeed, the best that many wedding service liturgies can do to insist that Jesus himself supported the institution of marriage is to say that he once turned up at one. None of which is to attack the institution of marriage, which provides many with a permanent, faithful and stable context for loving relationships. Cardinal O'Brien is, however, getting completely carried away when he speaks of gay marriage as an attempt to \"redefine reality\". Traditionally, the church has explained the purpose of marriage in terms of three features: that it's the proper context for raising children, that it promotes monogamy and that it exists for the mutual comfort and society of one person for another. How can the application of these three features to gay marriage justify the cardinal's blustering hyperbole? Of course, the cardinal has not been alone in seeking to whip up moral panic. The Archbishop of York recently described David Cameron's expressed desire to extend marriage to homosexuals as something done by \"dictators\". It is good, therefore, that a younger generation of church leaders, like the recently appointed Bishop of Salisbury and the new Dean of St Paul's are taking a different line. The argument that gay marriage undermines straight marriage is as unconvincing as it is insulting \u2013 as if the currency of marriage is devalued by extension to those who find love with members of the same sex. In fact, the reality that religious conservatives are themselves failing to face is that civil partnerships are already being understood as a form of marriage, with or without the endorsement of the church. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. Some in the church continue to fight a rearguard action for the extension of civil partnership rights to siblings. In this way they hope to drive a wedge between marriage and civil partnership. But that ship has sailed. The language of marriage and of husband or wife is increasingly common parlance among those who have entered into civil partnerships. And while some in the gay community worry about the use of what they take to be a heterosexual paradigm, this anxiety is also diminishing. Gay marriage is effectively already a reality.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats' federal committees must today allow for an unrestricted debate on the health bill at the party's spring conference \u2013 and the delegates assembling in Gateshead must then seize their final chance to demand that this dire legislation be scrapped. It was the same spring conference in 2011 which forced the unprecedented parliamentary pause. Delegates might have liked to kill the bill back then, but they rightly took their collectively responsibility seriously, and so instead demanded specific changes to bring it into line with the coalition agreement. That document had, after all, followed Lib Dem policy in proposing to democratise the primary care trusts which Andrew Lansley later moved unilaterally to abolish. It had referred to the regulator, Monitor, the engine which will drive marketisation, in somewhat oblique terms \u2013 not specifying the lopsided obligation later put on it to \"promote competition\" above all else. And although this drive to privatise was evident in obscure Conservative party documents in early 2010, it was conspicuous by its absence in David Cameron's reassuring manifesto. This, therefore, was not merely a bill that the Lib Dems had not agreed to, but a bill that nobody had voted for. That gave the party a powerful negotiating position, and \u2013 for a time \u2013 it appeared to be playing it well at Westminster. The whole rhetoric of the reforms was recast so that competition was no longer an end in itself, but a means to be applied only where it would benefit patients. But the party must now recognise that the other side has ratted on the deal that it reasonably thought it had done. There have been worthy advances on public health, but the welcome change of tone on markets was not satisfactorily reflected in the bill. Yes, there was some widening of Monitor's remit, and more recently the restoration of the legal duties on the secretary of state. On closer reading, however, many changes were not what they seemed. Rather like a pompous individual who says \"not unlike\" when \"like\" would do, the bill's new mandate for Monitor to \"prevent anti-competitive practices\" adds syntax without changing the underlying thought. If you doubt the basic continuity, just read the defiant defence of the competitive thrust of the reforms which Mr Lansley recently penned for Health Service Journal; there he compared the nascent market in medicine to that in electronic goods. Lib Dems may half-believe and half-hope that they have changed the design, but the architect himself smiles on with satisfaction as he watches the foundation stones fall into place, exactly where he wants them. The party's president now fingers Labour for letting the market rip. There is something to that: Tony Blair did sign off on some appalling private contracts. But this is utterly beside the point now. Those duff deals were done in the NHS good times when a little money could be squandered without jeopardising benign public perceptions. The new Tory drive to privatise comes in the form of a hated bill, amid a botched reorganisation and at the start of the longest spending squeeze in NHS history. Lib Dems must decide whether or not they want to own the hideous headaches to come. Delegates may be told that the tweaked bill represents the best deal they could get. Contemptuous Tories, who mutter that with a sixth of the MPs their partners are ripe for cutting down to size, will be thrilled by such talk. The truth is that there were two Lib Dem voters for every three Conservatives in 2010, and the Tories cannot rule alone. If the Lib Dem voice speaks loud and clear, it will count. There may also be claims that it is simply too late say no. Don't believe it. Officials know it's not done until it hits the statute book, so have developed plans B and C. It may even be said that the Lords cannot halt a bill on third reading. In fact, though it has not been done for a while, it is perfectly allowed. The one real difficulty with changing course is that the prime minister has made this a virility test. The Liberal Democrats will neuter themselves if they indulge him in that.",

The 26-year-old is expected to complete a \u00a310.9m move from K\u00f6ln to the London club at the end of the current campaign and will commit to a four-year deal that, according to sources in Germany, is worth around \u00a3100,000 a week when signing on fees and associated bonuses are taken into account. His manager at K\u00f6ln, Stale Solbakken, was resigned to losing his services in the summer and Anzhi, an emerging force in European football who are now overseen by Guus Hiddink, had been willing to pay him a weekly salary of nearer \u00a3200,000 to swap the Bundesliga for the Russian Premier League. The club, bank-rolled by the billionaire Suleyman Kerimov and based in Dagestan, are seventh in their domestic league, 12 points off Zenit St Petersburg at the top, but aspire to reaching the Champions League. The former Barcelona and Internazionale forward Samuel Eto'o leads the line, with Roberto Carlos another high-profile player at the club. Around \u00a311m was spent last month to secure Blackburn Rovers' Congolese defender Christopher Samba. Yet Podolski, who has scored 16 goals this season despite his hometown club languishing just above the relegation places, has instead opted for a move to England, having previously stated that his future would not be determined by the highest bidder. \"Money is not the most important thing for me,\" he had told Sport-Bild. \"What is crucial is the development of my game.\" His arrival will still be considered something of a coup at Arsenal, particularly if the Poland-born forward goes on to excel for Germany at the summer's European Championship, and represents a shift in policy from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to secure more established talent.

      "bodyText": "Glancing down a list of boardroom personnel at Chelsea \u2013 Bruce Buck, Ron Gourlay, Eugene Tenenbaum \u2013 it's hard to avoid the conclusion Roman Abramovich selected them not so much for their financial or business acumen, as for the fact they sound like the cast of characters from a bonkbusting 1980s US TV mini-series starring Jan-Michael Vincent and Morgan Fairchild. Perhaps the enigmatic Russian plans to assemble the candidates for the ejector seat recently vacated with a squawk by Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas and \u2013 in the style of Phoebe Cates in Shirley Conran's Lace \u2013 raise an eyebrow, pout and demand: \"Which one of you sons of bitches is my manager?\" Many observers have claimed that the coach is not the real issue at Chelsea, and that if the club is to prosper changes must be made \"at the top\". This has led to speculation that Abramovich may be on the brink of firing himself. Though it is unlikely the Russian will do the deed face to face, preferring to use an intermediary, possibly named Stag LaFarge. Naturally enough there has been a large amount of interest in what it has become de rigueur to call \"The Chelsea Salary\". One of the first top-level coaches to, in the currently worn-to-a-nubbin clich\u00e9, \"step up to the plate\" was Rafa Ben\u00edtez (indeed, judging by the shape of the Spaniard he has stepped up to the plate more than once). Thrillingly the former Anfield goatee-in-chief has proved eminently capable of delivering just the sort of overwrought speeches the Stamford Bridge shopping-and-shagging saga demands, declaring that Liverpool fans loved him and, \"if they love me, they will understand\". It was a statement that couldn't fail to bring a tear to the eye of anyone who recalls Richard Bach, author of 70s mega-seller Jonathan Livingston Seagull, who told us: \"If you love someone set them free. If they come back they are yours. If they don't they never were.\" Sadly Rafa stopped short of anything that quite matched Bach's \"to fly as fast as thought to anywhere that is now \u2013 you begin by knowing you have already arrived\", but there is yet time. Fernando Torres for one would surely benefit from such a piece of wisdom, whether it comes from a football manager, or is delivered \u2013 as in the novel \u2013 by philosophical Chinese seabird. When it comes to overheated dialogue, Ben\u00edtez is certainly the frontrunner to succeed AVB. However, in an effort to make himself at least sound like the sort of suavely priapic jetsetter who might have dumped Brooke Adams for Sophie Ward while engaged in a bitter family feud over an emerald mine with James Farentino, I feel he might be wise to change his name by deed poll to something more redolent of shoulderpads, caviar and pi\u00f1a coladas \u2013 Paco St Moritz perhaps or Vuitton de Suiza.

The Swede is too smooth an operator to toss his hat into the ring, preferring to drop his name gently in the hope that hot air currents will waft it into the managerial frame. Sven is famous for utterances so gnomic they come with a fishing rod and a red hat. While he was England manager this made sound common sense. As another man famous for the opacity of his public declarations, the late Italian prime minister, Aldo Moro, once remarked when asked why he didn't make himself plainer: \"If the people understood what I was telling them, they'd all emigrate.\" On Monday the ex-England manager was on his best oblique form, telling reporters that he knew the Chelsea owner: \"I have met him 10 or 15 times for a cup of tea. I have not spent a week with him. For me he has great passion.\" Without stress it is impossible to know quite what Sven was driving at in that last sentence. If he were saying, \"For me he has a great passion,\" however, few would be surprised. After all, Abramovich wouldn't be the first ambitious ing\u00e9nue to catch sight of their reflection in the Swede's spectacles and find themselves instantly besotted. An 80s TV mini-series wouldn't have been complete without a love triangle, and lo, before you could say \"A Woman of Substance\", our flaring nostrils had caught the first whiff of one as the Football Association revealed that it has finally compiled a list of candidates to succeed the broodingly passionate maestro, Don Fabio. On Tuesday Radio 5 Live informed listeners that while the FA wouldn't reveal how many names were on the list \"the BBC understands [media shorthand for \"we took a guess and they didn't deny it\"] that there are more than three, but no more than 10\". The list was referred to as a \"shortlist\" suggesting that the International Committee had started out with a longlist, though exactly how long this longlist was would, at this stage, be futile to speculate, though past experience and current information would suggest that it was definitely more than 10 but in all likelihood substantially less than infinity. Will the FA's list contain some of the same names as Chelsea's list? You can bet your life on it. As a consequence the coming weeks will see wealth being ostentatiously flaunted, hair tossed, bosoms heaved, manhood stirred and possibly some saucy shenanigans with a goldfish as both sides wrestle for the one they love. Who exactly that is only the unfolding feature-length episodes can tell us. All I will say at this stage is that \u2013 based on statistics \u2013 you should never rule out a cameo by Joan Collins.",

      "body": "<p>Glancing down a list of boardroom personnel at Chelsea \u2013 Bruce Buck, Ron Gourlay, Eugene Tenenbaum \u2013 it's hard to avoid the conclusion Roman Abramovich selected them not so much for their financial or business acumen, as for the fact they sound like the cast of characters from a bonkbusting 1980s US TV mini-series starring Jan-Michael Vincent and Morgan Fairchild. Perhaps the enigmatic Russian plans to assemble the candidates for the ejector seat recently vacated with a squawk by Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas and \u2013 in the style of Phoebe Cates in Shirley Conran's Lace \u2013 raise an eyebrow, pout and demand: \"Which one of you sons of bitches is my manager?\"</p> <p>Many observers have claimed that the coach is not the real issue at Chelsea, and that if the club is to prosper changes must be made \"at the top\". This has led to speculation that Abramovich may be on the brink of firing himself. Though it is unlikely the Russian will do the deed face to face, preferring to use an intermediary, possibly named Stag LaFarge.</p> <p>Naturally enough there has been a large amount of interest in what it has become de rigueur to call \"The Chelsea Salary\". One of the first top-level coaches to, in the currently worn-to-a-nubbin clich\u00e9, \"step up to the plate\" was Rafa Ben\u00edtez (indeed, judging by the shape of the Spaniard he has stepped up to the plate more than once). Thrillingly the former Anfield goatee-in-chief has proved eminently capable of delivering just the sort of overwrought speeches the Stamford Bridge shopping-and-shagging saga demands, declaring that Liverpool fans loved him and, \"if they love me, they will understand\".</p> <p>It was a statement that couldn't fail to bring a tear to the eye of anyone who recalls Richard Bach, author of 70s mega-seller Jonathan Livingston Seagull, who told us: \"If you love someone set them free. If they come back they are yours. If they don't they never were.\"</p> <p>Sadly Rafa stopped short of anything that quite matched Bach's \"to fly as fast as thought to anywhere that is now \u2013 you begin by knowing you have already arrived\", but there is yet time. Fernando Torres for one would surely benefit from such a piece of wisdom, whether it comes from a football manager, or is delivered \u2013 as in the novel \u2013 by philosophical Chinese seabird.</p> <p>When it comes to overheated dialogue, Ben\u00edtez is certainly the frontrunner to succeed AVB. However, in an effort to make himself at least sound like the sort of suavely priapic jetsetter who might have dumped Brooke Adams for Sophie Ward while engaged in a bitter family feud over an emerald mine with James Farentino, I feel he might be wise to change his name by deed poll to something more redolent of shoulderpads, caviar and pi\u00f1a coladas \u2013 Paco St Moritz perhaps or Vuitton de Suiza.</p> <p>Scenting money, grey-haired old hunting fox, Sven-Goran Eriksson \u2013 the Richard Chamberlain of football \u2013 has also begun to descend the grand staircase.

      "bodyText": "Students from Stoke Newington School in north east London had Thursday off because it was \"progress review\" day. But it might just as well have been Stop Kony day. That's all they wanted to talk about. Six 14- to 15-year-olds gathered in Fergus Mason's house to discuss Kony 2012 \u2013 what the film meant, what the next stage of action was, how to stop the rebel leader. There was a sense of astonishment: that one man could be responsible for so much evil, that a film could have so much power, that they had the potential to change so much. Few of them had heard of Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, before the video Kony 2012 went viral on the internet. But now teenagers all over the world can tell you how his army, which has wreaked havoc for 26 years, rapes little girls and forces child soldiers to murder their parents. But if this film tells us anything about the 21st century it is about the power of celebrity and social networks. By 7pm on Thursday, nearly 50 million people had watched it \u2013 mostly because their friends had shared it with them on Facebook or their heroes on Twitter had alerted them to it. P. Diddy tweeted \"Dear Joseph Kony, I'm Gonna help Make you FAMOUS!!!! We will stop YOU #StopKONY ! All 6,000,000 of my followers RT NOW!!! Pls!\" \"#KONY2012 Spread the word!!! PLEASE go to Invisiblechildren.com Even if its 10 minutes \u2026 Trust me, you NEED to know about this! #1LOVE\" Rihanna tweeted to her 14 million-plus followers, and Justin Bieber told his army of 18 million: \"SO glad you're behind this! He MUST be stopped! THANK YOU for helping spread the word. POWER IS IN NUMBERS. #STOPKONY.\" And so it came to pass; the word spread like wildfire. Fergus said the first thing he was going to do was share it with as many people as possible. Owen Watts-Moore felt it was now the responsibility of children to educate their parents \u2013 to make them pay attention to an atrocity they turned their back on. He loves the way the film is inverting the traditional notion of celebrity. \"It's a clever idea \u2013 making Kony famous for his evil deeds.\" On the Invisible Children website, the film's director Jason \"Radical\" Russell is described as \"co-founder \u2026 as well as our grand story-teller and dreamer\". In Kony 2012, he tells us that Kony is the number one wanted man in the international criminal court and shows how his campaign has led to Barack Obama sending 100 US advisers (mainly soldiers) to hunt Kony. \"It was the first time in US history that the American government took action not because of self-defence but because people demanded it.\" Occasionally, it seems that Russell is encouraging acts of vigilantism (a citizen's arrest on Kony?) but gradually it becomes clear that he is asking the world's children to help with publicity, money and care. Lily Goldblatt was still emotional from seeing the film. \"It was so moving. My BlackBerry was going crazy with people watching the video. Everybody was really upset, crying. It's such a powerful message.\" What is that message? \"Children younger than me are being turned into murderers by Kony.\" It's funny, Lily said, a couple of days ago she didn't have a clue who Kony was. \"Then everything started coming up Kony, Kony, Kony and I was at a loss to what it was.\" But the more the youngsters think about the film, the more questions they have. After watching it, they researched Kony and Uganda on the internet, and came to the conclusion that the film was partial with its history and selective with its facts. \"It's good, and very well meaning,\" Fergus said,\"but it's very simplistic. There are other sides to the story they don't talk about. The Ugandan troops are not exactly saints, and they do glorify them a bit.\" The thing is, said his friend Dan McAteer, since Russell first went to Uganda to make a film about the LRA in 2006 the situation had changed \u2013 the LRA and Kony are thought to be something of a spent force. \"The film focuses solely on Kony and portrays him as an antichrist. You'd think Uganda is fine apart from Kony. But actually the government the film asks us to support is considered one of the most corrupt in the world. This is the same government that called for the killing of gay people to increase its popularity.\" Perhaps, inevitably, criticism of Kony 2012 has come thick and fast over the past 24 hours; it has been suggested that Russell is playing god. Is it right that a white middle-class American filmmaker should ask us to save Africa from itself; is the interview with George Clooney really supporting this particular film? Charlie Couve, 15, was worried about where the money raised by Invisible Children had gone. He pointed out that according to its own financial records, the organisation spent $8.9m (\u00a35.6m) and only $2.8m actually went to help Uganda. Dan agrees that the film overstates the case for the power of the individual and Facebook. \"The guy in the video says this is now a Facebook world, and the big pyramid with money at the top and people at the bottom has been turned on its head. Well I don't really think it has, because this is the first major event I've seen our lot [his friends] involved with. And in the end they're still lobbying the same governments to do the same things they would have 20 years ago. The only difference is people hear about it quicker because of social networks.\" But for all their scepticism, the teenagers in Stoke Newington think Kony 2012 has to be a good thing. \"I didn't realise how sick one person could be and create such problems in a place that doesn't need any more,\" Ella Barry said. \"It encouraged people to believe they can make a difference by speaking out.\" In the film, Russell promises a global day of action on 20 April, \"when we meet at sundown and blanket every street and every city till the sun comes up. The rest of the world will wake up to hundreds of thousands of people demanding justice in all corners.\" He tells his supporters: \"We are not just studying human history, we are shaping it\" and urges youngsters to buy the bracelet and action kit and donate what they can. \"We are the power,\" he says. \"A bunch of Littles can make a big difference.\" So what will the youngsters do next to bring Kony down? Most said they had already been on the internet to buy the bracelet and action kit, but came away a little disillusioned. \"Last time I looked it was $10 a bracelet,\" Charlie said, \"and then $20 more for overseas delivery, which I think is just \u2026 well it doesn't cost $20 to send a package overseas.\"",

You'd think Uganda is fine apart from Kony. But actually the government the film asks us to support is considered one of the most corrupt in the world. This is the same government that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/08/uganda-gay-death-sentence-bill\" title=\"\">called for the killing of gay people</a> to increase its popularity.\"</p> <p>Perhaps, inevitably, criticism of Kony 2012 has come thick and fast over the past 24 hours; it has been suggested that Russell is playing god. Is it right that a white middle-class American filmmaker should ask us to save Africa from itself; is the interview with George Clooney really supporting this particular film?</p> <p>Charlie Couve, 15, was worried about where the money raised by Invisible Children had gone. He pointed out that according to its own financial records, the organisation spent $8.9m (\u00a35.6m) and only $2.8m actually went to help Uganda.</p> <p>Dan agrees that the film overstates the case for the power of the individual and Facebook. \"The guy in the video says this is now a Facebook world, and the big pyramid with money at the top and people at the bottom has been turned on its head. Well I don't really think it has, because this is the first major event I've seen our lot [his friends] involved with. And in the end they're still lobbying the same governments to do the same things they would have 20 years ago. The only difference is people hear about it quicker because of social networks.\"</p> <p>But for all their scepticism, the teenagers in Stoke Newington think Kony 2012 has to be a good thing. \"I didn't realise how sick one person could be and create such problems in a place that doesn't need any more,\" Ella Barry said. \"It encouraged people to believe they can make a difference by speaking out.\"</p> <p>In the film, Russell promises a global day of action on 20 April, \"when we meet at sundown and blanket every street and every city till the sun comes up. The rest of the world will wake up to hundreds of thousands of people demanding justice in all corners.\"</p> <p>He tells his supporters: \"We are not just studying human history, we are shaping it\" and urges youngsters to buy the bracelet and action kit and donate what they can. \"We are the power,\" he says. \"A bunch of Littles can make a big difference.\"</p> <p>So what will the youngsters do next to bring Kony down? Most said they had already been on the internet to buy the bracelet and action kit, but came away a little disillusioned.</p> <p>\"Last time I looked it was $10 a bracelet,\" Charlie said, \"and then $20 more for overseas delivery, which I think is just \u2026 well it doesn't cost $20 to send a package overseas.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vincent Tchenguiz has exchanged bitter courtroom accusations with one of his oldest friends, Keyvan Rahimian, including a claim that the latter had been paid almost \u20ac800,000 (\u00a3670,000) in \"consultancy fees\" by someone else while working as one of the Mayfair property tycoon's most trusted confidantes. The two men, who grew up together in pre-revolution Iran, have been described as being \"akin to brothers\" before a bitter falling out in late 2008, when Tchenguiz allegedly accused Rahimian of stealing from him. They have been locked in a protracted legal dispute, with Rahimian claiming he is owed \u00a36.7m by Tchenguiz and the property tycoon insisting that he is due \u00a32m. Questioned by lawyers for Tchenguiz at the high court in London, Rahimian denied that payments in late 2007 had come from Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov or from Alshair Fiyaz, the Pakistani billionaire who recently abandoned a rescue bid for fashion chain Peacocks. \"I have never traded on any account for Mr Usmanov,\" said Rahimian. \"[He] is only a friend and we have never conducted any business together.\" In the summer of 2007, Usmanov \u2013 whose Mayfair offices are next door to Tchenguiz's \u2013 gained a high profile in the UK when he acquired a major stake in Arsenal football club. Rahimian did admit that, while living in Tchenguiz's home and working as his head of IT, he had received \u20ac791,000 from a company called Carule, which he said was for \"securities and equities research\". He also confirmed that some time after receiving this sum he paid \u20ac388,000 for a Mercedes Benz car in Paris, which he later transferred to Fiyaz. In angry exchanges, Rahimian accused Tchenguiz's lawyers of raising irrelevant matters in the hope of embarrassing him in court. The property tycoon's counsel made similar accusations about the evidence that Rahimian has sought to include. They claim that Rahimian is making \"irrelevant\" allegations that money transfers had been made, using his account, to pay for \"eastern European models to come to the UK\". They characterise this as a threat and say Rahimian is hoping to embarrass Tchenguiz into a settlement of an otherwise \"ridiculous\" claim. Rahimian also told the court he had been instructed to install \"spying software\" on the phone of an unnamed individual. Tchenguiz's lawyers described the individual as a \"consultant\", but Rahimian said: \"That is a very generous use of the term. I think he was given money by Mr Tchenguiz, but I don't think he was a consultant.\" Rahimian described the process as creating a \"hacked mobile phone\" and said he had installed the software on three other phones handed to him by Tchenguiz's security team. The case continues on Friday. Tchenguiz is expected to take the stand next week.",

      "bodyText": "Charities have warned that official figures showing a 14% rise in people classed as homeless are just the \"tip of the iceberg\", because they fail to capture huge numbers who have been displaced from their home and are living with friends, in hostels or on the streets. The latest homelessness figures also indicated local authorities are housing homeless families in bed-and-breakfast hotels because of a chronic shortage of suitable private temporary accommodation, a discredited practice that was almost eradicated by the Labour government. The latest government figures, published on Thursday, showed 48,510 applications for homelessness assistance were approved by councils in England in 2011, up from 42,390 in the previous year, the biggest increase for nine years. Campaigners warned that the problem would worsen in the coming months as the impact of housing benefit cuts took effect, forcing tens of thousands of families and vulnerable young people out of private rented homes. There was a 44% increase in households who were accepted as homeless after having their homes repossessed, and a 39% year-on-year increase in the numbers of people seeking help from the council after having their short-term tenancy terminated. The figures come days after official statistics showed the number of rough sleepers in England had gone up by a fifth. \"These figures are a shocking reminder of the divide between the housing haves and have nots in this country,\" said Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter. Leslie Morphy, chief executive of Crisis, said: \"Our worst fears are coming to pass. We face a perfect storm of economic downturn, rising joblessness and soaring demand for limited affordable housing combined with government policy to cut housing benefit plus local cuts to homelessness services.\" The shadow housing minister, Jack Dromey, said: \"The government's economic policies are failing, leading to rising unemployment, increases in fuel bills and the biggest squeeze on family incomes in a generation. \"Combined with the government's reckless changes to benefits, it was inevitable that homelessness would rise and that it will continue to rise.\" Grant Shapps, the housing minister, blamed the previous government for the rise, claiming the figures underlined \"how the debt-laden economy we inherited is leaving a legacy of hard-up households across the country\". Centrepoint said although the figures showed the number of homeless young people was on the rise \u2013 17,000 16- to 24-year-olds were classed by councils as homeless in 2011, up from 15,500 the previous year \u2013 the statistics failed to capture the scale of the problem. The charity said its research estimated that the number of young people using hostels or sleeping rough could be nearer 60,000, a figure over three times the official figure. Councils are only obliged to find temporary accommodation for three main groups of young people who present as homeless: all 16- and 17-year-olds, someone leaving local authority care aged 18-20, and young people with dependent children. Many other homeless youngsters fall through the net, said Centrepoint. Its chief executive, Seyi Obakin, said: \"These figures highlight the bleak outlook for the 80,000 young people who find themselves rough sleeping, sofa surfing and seeking support from charities. With more than a million young people unemployed and an increasing shortage of affordable housing, the outlook is set to get worse. \"The bottom line is that this country desperately needs more homes and more support for young people to help them find a job and succeed in independent living. \"In the meantime, we want to see government and local authorities taking steps to make the private rented sector more accessible for young people.\" Charities are anticipating a further increase in homelessness among younger people this year as a result of housing benefit changes that cap the amount of housing benefit paid to individuals under the age of 35 who live on their own in private rented accommodation. The number of families put up by councils in emergency bed-and- breakfast accommodation has increased by over a third, signalling that local authorities are struggling to find suitable and affordable temporary housing for homeless families. The figures suggest fewer families are being put up in private rented accommodation, possibly reflecting a desire among landlords. Official guidance for local authorities says bed and breakfast temporary accommodation should be avoided \"wherever possible\". Lack of privacy, and amenities such as cooking and laundry means it is \"not suitable\" for families with children or pregnant women \"unless there is no alternative accommodation available and then only for a maximum of six weeks.\" Kensington and Chelsea council in central London estimated last year that 1,000 households presented to the council as homeless as a result of the housing benefit changes, effectively doubling the number of households for whom it would have to provide expensive temporary accommodation. The council warned that these families would have to be relocated in homes outside London. Homeless Link, which represents over 400 homelessness organisations across the UK, said a lack of suitable and affordable private rented accommodation meant homeless people were increasingly stuck in hostels because there was nowhere suitable to move them on to. Interim chief executive Matt Harrison said: \"We believe a lack of affordable accommodation, rent inflation and housing benefit restrictions are fuelling homelessness and making it more difficult to help people once they become homeless.\" Squeezed Rent rise and benefits cap Sandra Munoz got her eviction letter the week she got her notice from Wandsworth council saying her housing benefits would be capped. Munoz, 38, a single mother, had lived in the ex-council flat in Battersea with her son for two years, paying a weekly private rent of \u00a3250, when she was told she'd have to move last April. The landlord wanted an extra \u00a3100 a week rent and with the housing benefit cuts she could not meet that. She got two months to vacate and her first port of call was the council. \"They said they couldn't help me because I still had two months to find accommodation. I couldn't find anything on [housing] benefits in Wandsworth and anything below the cap. [Landlords] didn't want to accept people on benefits.\" Even after the deadline passed the council said her case wasn't an emergency; she would have to wait until her landlord forcibly evicted her and her five-year-old son before they got re-housing assistance, she said. \"Before the council accepts they have a duty to help you, they wait until you're really on the street basically.\" It was the week before Christmas when Munoz, who has lived in the UK for 14 years both as a full-time worker and a student and volunteer, attended her eviction case at court. Unable to pay the rent she inevitably lost and a few weeks ago the bailiffs were ready to move. \"[The council] wanted me to come to the office just after the bailiffs came. I said look, the bailiffs are coming at eight o'clock in the morning, your offices are opening at nine. What am I supposed to do with my child and furniture?\" The council finally opted to re-house her the night before eviction. She now lives in a tiny flat in a council-run Balham hostel. The self-contained flat has just a room for her and her child and a sparsely furnished kitchenette without even a fridge. She said it was worse for bigger families. \"They are almost 100 families here. I've met some people here and they have three children and they are still living in the one bedroom.\" Munoz said the housing figures showing a 14% rise in homelessness must only represent those who were the most desperate, like herself, who had no family or friends to reply on. \"You have to go through so much pain to get here, that many people [looking for emergency accommodation] must just give up.\" And what will she do now? \"The council told me I'll have to stay here for six to eight months before I can move to permanent accommodation. Obviously I would love to go back to my community in Battersea where my child grew up \u2026 but they say, you can not decide, you only have one choice.\" Wandsworth council said: \"Throughout this whole process we have supported Ms Munoz we intervened on her behalf with her landlord to ascertain his intentions. And as it became clear that she could no longer reside in that property we found her somewhere else to live and ensured that she and her son had a roof over their heads.\" Shiv Malik",

Obviously I would love to go back to my community in Battersea where my child grew up \u2026 but they say, you can not decide, you only have one choice.\"</p> <p>Wandsworth council said: \"Throughout this whole process we have supported Ms Munoz we intervened on her behalf with her landlord to ascertain his intentions. And as it became clear that she could no longer reside in that property we found her somewhere else to live and ensured that she and her son had a roof over their heads.\"</p> <p><strong>Shiv Malik</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Ithink there's going to have to be a moratorium on shows set in the 1960s until we've all had a chance to let the memory of Mad Men fade. Let time sully its perfection just a little before you serve us up another. There was much to recommend White Heat (BBC2), the six-part series by award-winning writer Paula Milne, about a gang of 60s flatmates who are brought back together 40 years later by the death of one (we know not which yet) in the first episode, and whose stories unfold in flashback. The set-up is ripe and luscious: seven very different lives (possibly chosen for precisely that reason by their landlord, Jack, as a social experiment \u2013 though there is just as much chance that he just wants to bang one of the girls. The 60s in a nutshell) interweaving over the course of what I believe I am professionally bound to call Several Turbulent Decades. The performances by the actors playing the characters' younger selves are just wonderful \u2013 especially Lee Ingleby as fabulously uncool dude Alan \u2013 and as their older selves are played by the likes of Juliet Stevenson, Lindsay Duncan and Hugh Quarshie, we need not fear a drop-off in quality as we advance towards the present day. But there are many heavy clunks along the way, sounding even louder in the post-Mad Men temple at which we all now worship. Proto-feminist Charlotte lying on her bed reading Lady Chatterley's Lover (nothing else was published between 1959 and 1970. Nothing) while listening to records on one of those portable gramophones. A whistlestop tour of sexual liberation (Gloria Steinem on telly telling Joan Bakewell about the pill; Charlotte's hand stealing beneath her covers at night and finding something even better than the Beatles; pretending to be married to get the pill from a condescending GP and then having her heart and hymen broken \u2013 not in that order \u2013 by Jack). Art student Lily being told to abandon her studies for a job in a drapers by northern parents who actually say: \"It's not for the likes of us.\" And so on. But the story is good and now that we know who's who, where's who and in what year, maybe we can enjoy lighter taps from the narrative hammer in forthcoming episodes. I laughed many, many times during The Sarah Millican Television Programme (BBC2). At first glance, Millican's is a warm, unthreatening world of gentle comedy about nanas, nighties and nature programmes but, in fact, she's an iron fist in a Marigold glove. Her deadpan asides and sudden glances to camera have a touch of Eric Morecambe and her sudden shut-downs (\"You've got to be tolerant of all life,\" says Chris Packham. \"No,\" she replies simply) are things of beauty impossible to reproduce in print. The format's not right yet, but once it is, hopefully television will become Millican's world and we can live in it. In much the same way as I still cannot believe Eddie Izzard ran 43 marathons in 51 days \u2013 a feat that should not be possible unless you are the direct offspring of Atalanta herself \u2013 I still cannot believe that David Walliams swam a) the Channel (in 2006) or b) 140 miles of the river Thames (last year, for Sport Relief). But the proof was there last night in David Walliams: The Big Swim (BBC1), which followed him all the way through the bacteria-laden waters from Lechlade in Gloucestershire to his triumphant, exhausted, intestinally wrecked arrival in Westminster eight days later. It wasn't, to be honest, a brilliant documentary. A determined man swimming determinedly is, in purely televisual terms, dull and Walliams was too knackered in between epic stretches to scintillate. Then Jimmy Carr, comedy's answer to Weil's disease, turned up \u2013 which improved Walliams' mood, as they're friends, but the rest of us had to wait for Rob Brydon to break the monotony. He rode in a dinghy alongside Walliams for part of his final 40 or so miles. \"Could I ask you some questions? Please give me some attention. Is there going to be any more Little Britain? No? Well, carry on then.\" What it was, of course, was a brilliant vehicle for doing what the Comic and Sport Relief teams are out to do \u2013 alerting and re-alerting us to the almost unfathomable suffering going on around this huge and horrible world. Walliams' progression up the Thames was intercut with scenes from his trip to Kisumu in Kenya meeting some of the 20,000 street kids there. He met 12-year-old Philip, orphaned and homeless since he was eight. He chirpily showed Walliams where he and his young friends slept and scavenged. But later he cried quietly. \"Sometimes,\" he whispered, \"I am just alone.\" Walliams hugged him and raised \u00a31m to help him. You could cry a river. Of cash, of course, ideally.",

The 28-year-old took silver on day six of the British Gas Swimming Championships in 1min 58.42sec, two hundreths of a second behind Joe Roebuck, whose victory made him the first British swimmer to qualify for three different Olympic disciplines following the 400m individual medley and the 200m butterfly, in which the 26-year-old also took gold. Goddard, the Commonwealth champion and British record holder, led at the split only for Roebuck to drive past him in the final 10 metres. That was not a huge concern for the Manchester City fan \u2013 who collected his silver medal in a \"Why Always Me?\" T-shirt in tribute to Mario Balotelli \u2013 given he has what will probably be his last chance to climb an Olympic podium, having missed out in Athens and Beijing. \"I'm excited about the time I did here and relieved to have qualified,\" Goddard said. \"The main thing now is that I stay strong and healthy between now and the Olympics.\" That will be easier said than done for a man who was forced to give up on trying to qualify in the 200m backstroke due to a chronic shoulder injury and, curiously, said his preparations for this race had been disrupted by \"some illnesses\" which he would only talk about closer to the Games. There was no such vagueness from the forever upbeat Fran Halsall after she sealed a place in a second Olympic discipline with victory in the 100m freestyle. The 21-year-old, who has also qualified in the 100m butterfly, came home in a season's best time of 53.57. \"I'm over the moon,\" the European champion and British record holder said. \"I'm disappointed with the time as I felt I could have swum faster but at this time of the year, this is the fastest I've ever been, so that's positive.\" Amy Smith booked an Olympic place after taking silver, while in the women's 200m breaststroke, the reigning champion, Stacey Tadd, made Team GB after winning in 2:26.63, an English record.",

      "bodyText": "Manchester United must have wished that this truly were a second-rate event. The Premier League club deserved to lose clearly and in the last minute Iker Muniain scored to take Athletic's lead to 3-1 but the hosts reacted with Wayne Rooney converting a penalty. But United were outplayed for much of the Europa League tie. The side from Bilbao fell 1-0 down yet never seemed perturbed by the fact. So far as the Old Trafford atmosphere was concerned it became one of anxiety. Once Fernando Llorente had put the visitors on level terms the evening fell under the control of Marcelo Bielsa's squad. There was a reminder here that an event of this sort can be much more challenging than a Premier League encounter at this stadium. There is a hierarchy of honours and some trophies tend to be treated with disdain. In practice, though, clubs will always find themselves being seduced when they start to picture themselves landing a piece of silverware. Liverpool, for instance, did not have to fake delight when they took the Carling Cup this season. By the same token, United are unlikely to snub a prize. The trouble here was that the visitors gleamed with ambition of their own and it came as a surprise when United went ahead in the 22nd minute after a fine build-up that culminated with Ryan Giggs setting up Rooney to shoot home. All the same, that breakthrough had none of the inevitability associated with United on their own pitch. If anything, the enterprise from Athletic had been more obvious. Nor did the La Liga side get discouraged and pulled level in the 44th minute, when a patient buildup concluded with Fernando Llorente heading in after a cross by Markel Susaeta from the right of the penalty area. Once snobbery is jettisoned, tournaments all hold some kind of appeal. The Europa League is not just a chore for United, particularly when the opposition have such appetite. The side might have won readily in Amsterdam, but the return at Old Trafford saw Ajax put up a fight before being eliminated in what was ultimately a tense occasion. Athletic were hardly the sort of club who would capitulate either. They got this far after topping a group in which Paris Saint-Germain were knocked out despite the extraordinary sums poured into the French club by its Qatari owners. There was no cause for anyone in the stands or technical area at Old Trafford to be stifling a yawn over this contest. United are in a gradual transition and this sort of evening had its worth for testing their mettle. There were saves from David de Gea and all manner of blocks by his team-mates, yet United had a line-up that showed they were entirely in earnest. The selection was far from experimental even if senior figures such as Rio Ferdinand were to be found on the bench. There was sense of Sir Alex Ferguson attempting to calibrate the degree of experience that would leave the club well-placed without making undue demands of a squad whose priority is the Premier League title. It was open to question in those opening 45 minutes whether he had assessed the situation perfectly. United did have an emphasis on attack. Rooney, for instance, was in the starting line-up that included a specialist finisher in Javier Hern\u00e1ndez as well as a winger such as Ashley Young. This, in essence, was a side set up in an almost traditional 4-4-2 system. Perhaps Bilbao were deemed vulnerable, yet they are a creditable fifth in La Liga. Given the challenge of their domestic scene it seemed improbable that this fixture would disconcert them. Indeed, there was relish to their work. United were unsettled on occasion and might have had a penalty awarded against them when Chris Smalling appeared to tug Fernando Llorente in the 19th minute. The break of 15 minutes did nothing to snap the visitors' concentration and United were once again compelled to scramble as they defended in a manner that looked increasing preposterous as Athletic performed with vigour and finesse. United were obliged to think primarily on defence and Chris Smalling was withdrawn. Phil Jones retreated into the back four as did Michael Carrick. The visitors may have wearied just a little and United did not hesitate to make alterations with Anderson introduced for Park Ji-sung. There was some benefit although it also appeared that Athetic had tired themselves with all that pummelling of the hosts in the opening 45 minutes. That seemed to be reflected by a booking for Mikel San Jos\u00e9 for a foul on Hern\u00e1ndez. Muniain had to be denied by De Gea before Athletic moved into a lead they fully merited. Oscar de Marcos scored after an exquisite build-up that released him. United lagged in the tie, but must have known that they had been outplayed for much of the night.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The kidnap and killing of a British and Italian hostage in northern Nigeria marks a worrying new development in the violence wreaked by the country's militant Islamists. Responsibility for the abduction was initially claimed by a previously unheard-of group called al-Qaida in the Land Beyond the Sahel, but Nigerian security sources believe that the kidnappers came from a faction of Boko Haram, an Islamist sect responsible for almost 1,000 deaths since it launched an uprising in 2009. According to Nigerian security sources, the hostages were being kept in the remote northern city of Sokoto at the time of the attempted rescue. The centuries-old Muslim trading hub has until now escaped the brunt of violence by Boko Haram, which means \"western education is sinful\" in the Hausa language of northern Nigeria. But several hundred miles of porous and poorly policed borders with Niger makes Sokoto a haven for kidnappers from Boko Haram or al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, known as Aqim. Both groups see themselves as offshoots of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida and loosely model themselves on the Taliban. But neither is a single, coordinated organisation, and each is divided into various factions more or less willing to use violence to achieve their aims, analysts say. Vast geographies and weak central governments mean that Nigeria and its northern neighbours have struggled to prevent ordinary citizens or criminal-minded terrorists from slipping across borders. Roaming the vast deserts that span Niger, Mauritania, Mali, Chad and Western Sahara, Aqim operates largely unchecked by these under-resourced governments. But the Algerian-founded movement has yet to implant itself in Nigeria where militancy, to date, has been a localised phenomenon. Officials say factions within each of the groups have been in contact with each other. According to Nigerian intelligence officials, members of the more radical Boko Haram factions have received training from Aqim in Algeria and possibly Afghanistan. Aqim is thought to have given Boko Haram advice on urban terrorist tactics and suicide bombings. Aqim has perfected what analysts call a \"kidnap economy\", thriving off the abduction and ransom of westerners and Africans. It often snatches hostages in one country and moves them across one or more borders, ending up in Aqim bases in Mali. Reports suggest Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara were moved around but remained within Nigerian borders, which makes it unlikely that Aqim was behind the atrocity. To date, Boko Haram has shunned kidnapping as a cash cow or ideology. The group generally favours untargeted mass bomb attacks. But it has shown increasing sophistication in its campaign, graduating from crude bombs to more sophisticated improvised explosive devices. Is targets have also become more ambitious: an attack on the UN office in Abuja last year signalled that foreigners were considered legitimate targets.

      "body": "<p>The kidnap and killing of a British and Italian hostage in northern Nigeria marks a worrying new development in the violence wreaked by the country's militant Islamists.</p> <p>Responsibility for the abduction was initially claimed by a previously unheard-of group called al-Qaida in the Land Beyond the Sahel, but Nigerian security sources believe that the kidnappers came from a faction of Boko Haram, an Islamist sect responsible for almost 1,000 deaths since it launched an uprising in 2009.</p> <p>According to Nigerian security sources, the hostages were being kept in the remote northern city of Sokoto at the time of the attempted rescue. The centuries-old Muslim trading hub has until now escaped the brunt of violence by Boko Haram, which means \"western education is sinful\" in the Hausa language of northern Nigeria. But several hundred miles of porous and poorly policed borders with Niger makes Sokoto a haven for kidnappers from Boko Haram or al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, known as Aqim.</p> <p>Both groups see themselves as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/27/boko-haram-nigerian-sunni-militant?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">offshoots of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida and loosely model themselves on the Taliban</a>. But neither is a single, coordinated organisation, and each is divided into various factions more or less willing to use violence to achieve their aims, analysts say.</p> <p>Vast geographies and weak central governments mean that Nigeria and its northern neighbours have struggled to prevent ordinary citizens or criminal-minded terrorists from slipping across borders.</p> <p>Roaming the vast deserts that span Niger, Mauritania, Mali, Chad and Western Sahara, Aqim operates largely unchecked by these under-resourced governments. But the Algerian-founded movement has yet to implant itself in Nigeria where militancy, to date, has been a localised phenomenon.</p> <p>Officials say factions within each of the groups have been in contact with each other. According to Nigerian intelligence officials, members of the more radical Boko Haram factions have received training from Aqim in Algeria and possibly Afghanistan. Aqim is thought to have given Boko Haram advice on urban terrorist tactics and suicide bombings.</p> <p>Aqim has perfected what analysts call a \"kidnap economy\", thriving off the abduction and ransom of westerners and Africans. It often snatches hostages in one country and moves them across one or more borders, ending up in Aqim bases in Mali. Reports suggest Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara were moved around but remained within Nigerian borders, which makes it unlikely that Aqim was behind the atrocity.</p> <p>To date, Boko Haram has shunned kidnapping as a cash cow or ideology. The group generally favours untargeted mass bomb attacks. But it has shown increasing sophistication in its campaign, graduating from crude bombs to more sophisticated improvised explosive devices. Is targets have also become more ambitious: a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/26/nigeria-attack-islamists-claim-responsibility\" title=\"\">n attack on the UN office in Abuja last year</a> signalled that foreigners were considered legitimate targets.</p> <p>The diversity of methods suggests, observers say, that the group is increasingly splintered. That raises the frightening possibility that the kidnappers are most likely an offshoot of Boko Haram mimicking Aqim's tactics. This could spell a new chapter of terror in the north of the country, mirroring the decade of kidnappings that plagued Nigeria's southern oil creeks until a 2009 amnesty. Most hostages taken by oil militants were held for ransom and released safely \u2013 but the jihadi ideology that fuels Islamist militancy would make such outcomes far less likely in the north.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scores of convictions for serious crimes may have to be reviewed after a serious blunder by a leading private forensics firm led to a suspected rapist being acquitted, the Guardian has learned. The company, LGC Forensics, has admitted that a sample at one of its laboratories became so contaminated it could not be offered in evidence. The rape case, investigated by Greater Manchester police, collapsed this week with the defendant, Adam Scott, 20, who denied the allegation, being acquitted after prosecutors decided they could no longer rely on the forensic evidence. His alleged victim is said to be devastated. A senior source said: \"Potentially this has national implications. Hundreds of cases will have to be reviewed. We have no idea what the parameters will have to be. It's serious \u2013 it's dealing with the credibility of the system.\" LGC admitted that the sample tying the defendant to the attack had become contaminated with his DNA. It said: \"LGC deeply regrets that forensic evidence was contaminated with the defendant's DNA in one of our laboratories. \"LGC has already identified the cause of this contamination, and has taken steps to ensure that it cannot happen again. Our procedure for tracking, identifying and reporting potential contamination will be immediately reviewed and updated. We are also co-operating fully with Greater Manchester police.\" LGC refused to answer questions, such as at which lab the contamination had taken place and what exactly caused the contamination. The senior source pointed out that the cases of most concern were those resting solely or wholly on forensics. The credibility of LGC and the integrity of its procedures to guard against contamination was central to the conviction of two men for the murder of Stephen Lawrence in January. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted predominantly on the basis of forensic evidence from LGC. The trial judge directed that the jury could not consider any other evidence until they were sure they could rule out contamination, which had been the key argument in the defence case. The case in Manchester that prompted the forensics alert collapsed on Tuesday. Steve Heywood, assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said: \"On Tuesday we were made aware that a DNA profile provided by LGC Forensics in connection with a sexual assault had been contaminated during the testing process in their laboratories. \"The exact circumstances of how the sample was contaminated at the laboratory are yet to be established but I am determined to discover what has occurred. We will work closely with LGC Forensics, the Home Office and other partners to review the full facts of what has taken place. \"In addition we will be conducting an internal review of some investigations where LGC Forensics has been used in the processing of forensic evidence. At this time there is nothing to suggest any other cases within GMP will be affected.\" The CPS said it had had no choice but to drop the rape case after it emerged that the forensic evidence had become contaminated in the LGC lab. \"The key and significant evidence in the case was scientific evidence linking the defendant to the incident. We were notified earlier this week by Greater Manchester police of further information they had received that the scientific evidence in the original submission could no longer be relied on. \"We have a continuing duty to review cases as they develop and concluded that in view of this new information the prosecution against the defendant should not continue. We immediately informed the court and the defence and offered no evidence. The defendant was formally acquitted of the offence.\" Police forces have turned to private suppliers after the government decided to shut down the Forensic Science Service. Its closure was announced in December 2010 by the home secretary, Theresa May, because the government-owned company had been losing \u00a32m a month and was at risk of going into administration. A Home Office spokesman said: \"DNA evidence is a vital tool for the police which has helped convict thousands of violent and dangerous criminals. \"Forensic science regulator Andrew Rennison has launched an immediate investigation to find out what lessons can be learned from this individual case.\" LGC has a reputation for leading the way in cutting-edge science and has had success in cold-case reviews, where seemingly dead-end cases result in convictions after fresh forensic techniques produce new evidence.",

      "bodyText": "Shares, the euro and oil all rose sharply on the world's financial markets on Thursday amid signs that Greece had won sufficient support from its private-sector creditors to clinch a new bailout package. Greek officials reported high levels of take-up by private creditors for the deal. After markets had closed last night one senior government official told Reuters the take-up had been close to 95% an hour before the deadline, more than enough to banish fears that renewed crisis in Greece would hit economic growth and financial markets around the world. Global stocks enjoyed their best day in more than two months and the euro rose 1.5 cents against the dollar on hopes recession in the eurozone would be short-lived. The cost of crude was up nearly two cents a barrel in London to just over $126. Traders said there was relief that Greece had won enough support from its private sector creditors to trigger a second bailout \u2013 worth \u20ac130bn (\u00a3109bn) \u2013 from the International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank. Lorne Baring, managing director of Swiss-based B Capital Wealth Management, said: \"The Greek debt restructuring looks set to be passed and sets the scene for an orderly default whereby debts owed by Athens will fall by 2020 to an estimated 120% of GDP. That's another short-term worry out of the way, despite the overlooked fact that this is the biggest sovereign default in history. \"A managed bust is better than a chaotic one and finally reality over Greece's insolvency dawns on the investors who still own its bonds.\" The Greek government had been hoping the holders of at least 95% of the country's bonds in private hands would have agreed to the debt swap, which would see them lose more than half their investment, by Thursday night's deadline . But while it appeared that some hedge funds were holding out for better terms, Athens needed only a two-thirds acceptance rate to activate collective action clauses that would force the deal on the vast majority of private investors. Greece's finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, told the cabinet that the debt swap was \"going well\". Dario Perkins, an analyst at Lombard Street Research, said the expected agreement would buy Greece \"some additional time, maybe a few months, but it is unlikely to change the end result. Ultimately \u2013 as we may have mentioned once or twice before \u2013 we expect Greece to default 'properly' and leave the euro area.\" The ECB left interest rates unchanged at 1% as it published new forecasts underlining the impact of the sovereign debt crisis on activity in the 17 countries that use the single currency. While the bank's president, Mario Draghi, said a deal was \"very close\", his economic staff said they now expected eurozone growth this year of between -0.5% and 0.3% (down from a previous forecast of between -0.4% and 1%). In 2013, they forecast growth of between 0% and 2.2% (down from between 0.3% and 2.3%) On inflation, the ECB expects the consumer price index to be between 2.1% and 2.7% (from 1.5% to 2.5%). Analysts said the pick-up in inflation ruled out further cuts in the cost of borrowing. Economic data for Greece itself showed that more than half of those (51.1%) aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed \u2013 a doubling in the past three years. The overall jobless rate hit 21% in December 2011. Although many economists fear that the crisis in the eurozone is far from over, the mood in the financial markets was upbeat. The FTSE 100 finished 68 points higher at 5859, up almost 1.2%. The French CAC and the German DAX enjoyed stronger rallies, both finishing 2.5% higher. Shares on Wall Street rose in morning trading, with sentiment boosted both by developments in Greece and by hopes that today's US unemployment report will show the world's biggest economy finally emerging from the financial crisis and economic slowdown of the past five years. Dan Dorrow, director of research at Faros Trading in Stamford Connecticut, said: \"By Greece avoiding a disorderly default it will remove a key risk hanging over the markets over the next few weeks.\"",

      "bodyText": "Nick Clegg heads to a highly unpredictable spring conference facing a warning from party activists that he must change course on health, the economy and broader political strategy, or risk further reverses that will see Liberal Democrat councillors very thin on the ground after the May local elections. Clegg, who has been increasingly willing to air his differences with the Conservatives, will make a robust defence of the coalition and urge his party to stop looking in the rear-view mirror about the fateful 2010 decision to go into government with the Conservatives. Although a new grouping, Liberal Left, will unfurl its banner at a fringe meeting opposing the continuance of the coalition as a threat to liberal values, the vast bulk of the party recoils at the idea of ministers quitting within two years of taking office, so provoking an election in which they would probably be hung, drawn and ridiculed. But there is a growing nervousness about the risk of an existential threat to the party posed by the coalition. At a fringe meeting of the party's Scottish conference last week, ex-MSP Robert Brown offered this metaphor about the Liberal Democrats in coalition. \"It could be a bit like the story of the frog who was put in a vat of hot water. Frogs apparently adjust to their environment, so the frog didn't notice as the temperature was gradually increased \u2013 until he ended up being boiled alive. We have to be careful to avoid the fate of the frog.\" He added: \"We have to be careful too to avoid the problem which beset us in the 30s in the National government, when some Liberals peeled off to the right and some to the left, leaving an eviscerated rump. This party must be a broad church with room and space for all Liberal Democrats.\" Party members want reassurance that they will get out of this alive, and ideally with a new support base drawn to what the party achieved on tax, education and the economy. But the pressure will grow for a more independent identity, and more public displays of disagreements, making the coalition itself less stable. David Hall-Matthews, the chair of the increasingly influential Social Liberal Forum, said: \"There is a lot of concern and anxiety about the general direction of the party. If the May local elections are as bad as last year's we are going to be left very thin on the ground in terms of our councillor base.\" A lot of that anxiety will be crystallised at the conference around what to do about the unloved health bill. Hall-Matthews said: \"It is very rare for a bill to be as unpopular as this before it has even become law. Polls show that 10% of LD voters in 2010 now support it. \"Whether it causes us damage at the next election depends how the NHS itself is doing in 2015. The real fear is that the NHS will be suffering cuts then and it will be said we could have stopped this bill and we did not.\" The Liberal Democrats, being touchingly attached to representative democracy, will manage to spin out over three days whether even to vote against the bill, a move that might pit the parliamentary party against the conference, and leave the bill facing a new pitfall, only inches from reaching the statute book. The Federal Conference executive will probably allow two health bill motions and a motion on Syria through to a conference delegates ballot held on Saturday. Such are the tensions around the issue that opponents of the bill fear those wanting a debate on the NHS will split their vote, meaning that the call for a debate on Syria secures the most votes. But the SLF pressure is now extending its reach to the economy, setting out a plan C in a pamphlet calling for publicly accountable regional investment banks, public interest companies, increased workplace democracy and a National Investment Bank and a fiscal deficit \"sensitive to a broad range of economic indicators\". The pamphlet chimes with much of Vince Cable's thinking and the business secretary will speak at the pamphlet's launch this weekend. It also challenges George Osborne's economic strategy, saying it had not yet worked because \"it focused narrowly on direct measures to reduce the deficit and did not attempt to address the underlying causes of weak growth in jobs and output. The precipitous falls in tax receipts during and since the recession will continue unless a stimulus that outweighs the austerity and the 'automatic stabilisers' such as increased welfare spending is forthcoming.\" Those are specific criticisms that Cable would not share in public, but the pamphlet represents the most serious attempt by Liberal Democrats to set out a middle course between Ed Balls and Osborne. Clegg will boost morale of his party activists by telling them at a rally tonight to stop looking in the rear-view mirror. He will say it is time to stop \"justifying being in government and start advertising being in government. To stop lamenting what might have been and start celebrating what is. To stop defending our decisions and start shouting our achievements from the rooftops.\" He will list the achievements: \"Lower taxes for working people. Fairer chances for our children. And the beginnings of a new, green economy that benefits everyone in every city, not just a few in the City of London.\" He will also promise that the party is ready to keep punching in government, saying: \"I don't know about you, I'm up for a fight or two. This party has never ducked them. The great men and women in whose footsteps we follow never ducked them.\" The party president Tim Farron will also urge the party to stop apologising. He said: \"We got three-quarters of our manifesto into government policy, so I hereby allow you to stop saying sorry for the quarter we didn't get. \"And if people wanted that missing quarter, well, they should have flipping voted for us, shouldn't they?\"",

      "body": "<p>Nick Clegg heads to a highly unpredictable spring conference facing a warning from party activists that he must change course on health, the economy and broader political strategy, or risk further reverses that will see Liberal Democrat councillors very thin on the ground after the May local elections.</p> <p>Clegg, who has been increasingly willing to air his differences with the Conservatives, will make a robust defence of the coalition and urge his party to stop looking in the rear-view mirror about the fateful 2010 decision to go into government with the Conservatives.</p> <p>Although a new grouping, Liberal Left, will unfurl its banner at a fringe meeting opposing the continuance of the coalition as a threat to liberal values, the vast bulk of the party recoils at the idea of ministers quitting within two years of taking office, so provoking an election in which they would probably be hung, drawn and ridiculed.</p> <p>But there is a growing nervousness about the risk of an existential threat to the party posed by the coalition.</p> <p>At a fringe meeting of the party's Scottish conference last week, ex-MSP Robert Brown offered this metaphor about the Liberal Democrats in coalition. \"It could be a bit like the story of the frog who was put in a vat of hot water. Frogs apparently adjust to their environment, so the frog didn't notice as the temperature was gradually increased \u2013 until he ended up being boiled alive. We have to be careful to avoid the fate of the frog.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We have to be careful too to avoid the problem which beset us in the 30s in the National government, when some Liberals peeled off to the right and some to the left, leaving an eviscerated rump. This party must be a broad church with room and space for all Liberal Democrats.\"</p> <p>Party members want reassurance that they will get out of this alive, and ideally with a new support base drawn to what the party achieved on tax, education and the economy.</p> <p>But the pressure will grow for a more independent identity, and more public displays of disagreements, making the coalition itself less stable.</p> <p>David Hall-Matthews, the chair of the increasingly influential Social Liberal Forum, said: \"There is a lot of concern and anxiety about the general direction of the party. If the May local elections are as bad as last year's we are going to be left very thin on the ground in terms of our councillor base.\"</p> <p>A lot of that anxiety will be crystallised at the conference around what to do about the unloved health bill. Hall-Matthews said: \"It is very rare for a bill to be as unpopular as this before it has even become law. Polls show that 10% of LD voters in 2010 now support it.</p> <p>\"Whether it causes us damage at the next election depends how the NHS itself is doing in 2015. The real fear is that the NHS will be suffering cuts then and it will be said we could have stopped this bill and we did not.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats, being touchingly attached to representative democracy, will manage to spin out over three days whether even to vote against the bill, a move that might pit the parliamentary party against the conference, and leave the bill facing a new pitfall, only inches from reaching the statute book.</p> <p>The Federal Conference executive will probably allow two health bill motions and a motion on Syria through to a conference delegates ballot held on Saturday. Such are the tensions around the issue that opponents of the bill fear those wanting a debate on the NHS will split their vote, meaning that the call for a debate on Syria secures the most votes.</p> <p>But the SLF pressure is now extending its reach to the economy, setting out a plan C in a pamphlet calling for publicly accountable regional investment banks, public interest companies, increased workplace democracy and a National Investment Bank and a fiscal deficit \"sensitive to a broad range of economic indicators\".</p> <p>The pamphlet chimes with much of Vince Cable's thinking and the business secretary will speak at the pamphlet's launch this weekend.

      "bodyText": "This open letter began in my head a few days back as a response to the furor caused by multimedia personality Rush Limbaugh, but I realize this is so much bigger than one conservative calling a woman a \"slut\", or several men stating their opposition to birth control options for women without hearing the voices of just a few women. This letter is for the men and boys who defend males who have wounded women and girls, who seek to place blame on the females, in some way, when it is clear we men and boys are the aggressors in the vast majority of the cases of gender violence in America, and in most places globally. I was once that kind of man-child, so I am writing from direct experience. Thanks to God, years of therapy, a desire to heal and change, and a commitment to being an ally to women and girls, that is why I am writing this open letter. I no longer think violence in any form is acceptable, no matter who is committing the act. For sure, this letter is for grown men and viable businesses, like the rapper Too Short and XXL magazine, which recently made a video that literally encouraged sexual abuse toward women and girls. All for the sake of fun and profit. In spite of such blatant examples, I've heard many males say things like \"What about the women, the girls, who participate in the videos, who pose for the pictures?\" My response is simple: ignorance is a global phenomenon. Just because someone engages in behavior that debases who she or he is does not mean we should take part in it, too. That is why we celebrate Women's History Month and International Women's Day each March, to learn, and to challenge what has become normal and acceptable. I believe it time for us men and boys to think more deeply about how we define manhood, and how for so many of us it is not only cruel to women and girls, but to ourselves as well. It is dishonest for so-called progressive or liberal men to act as though it is simply rappers, or men like Rush Limbaugh, who engage in foul and despicable behavior toward women and girls. I have heard and been present too many times when we have blasted brilliant women like Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, bell hooks, Gloria Steinem, or Melissa Harris-Perry, calling them names because we are threatened by their genius, their leadership, their refusal to submit to our notions of what a woman's place is. Or think of how many times liberal or progressive media pundits have dissed a woman for the way she looks, or the way she speaks, simply because we male pundits are jealous the woman is getting air time in the first place. Indeed, it is males of all political ideologies, all faiths, all races and cultures, and all ages and class backgrounds, who view women and girls as less than equal, as less worthy of our humanity and sense of fairness. That is because most of us have been taught or socialized, since we first had thoughts, that men and boys are the dominant beings on the planet; that women and girls are inferior to us; that they have no history, no real role on this planet except to produce children, to take care of the homes, to be our sexual trophies, to be our assistants and secretaries, or the help. We've been taught that manhood is rooted in domination, warfare and mindless competition, and a profound belief that women and girls are not the equals of men and boys. Some of us do know that women and girls are our equals on every level. I know, for sure, I would not be writing this now if it were not for the women who have been leaders in my life. I believe women are, and have always been, the true leaders on the planet, even when we men and boys think otherwise. And I feel there would be fewer wars, fewer international disputes, fewer religious and territorial wars, if women were the heads of more countries, if women were better represented in governments across the world. I am saying this to men and boys because it is time we ceased with the denials about what is really happening to women and girls on our planet. They are being oppressed, marginalized, discriminated against, raped, molested, beaten, harassed, and murdered daily. The numbers are so staggering, according to VDay founder Eve Ensler, that 1 billion women and girls on the planet, or one in three, will be the victim of some form of sexual assault in her lifetime. That means a woman and girl in your life \u2013 your mother, your grandmother, your sister, your aunt, your girlfriend, your wife, and your daughter \u2013 may be one of those sexual assault survivors. But how many of us men and boys have bothered to engage in dialogue with the women and girls in our lives about gender violence? How many of us have ever volunteered at a battered women's clinic, to see and hear the stories of women fleeing horrific physical and emotional violence at the hands of a male partner? How many of us have the courage to challenge sexist images of women and girls in films, on television, in magazines, in videos, in music, in the way we promote social events, even, with photos of scantily-clad women? And how many of us, alas, have the courage to stand up to a man who engages in any activity or language harmful to women and girls, even if we are the only man or boy in our circle or community to do so? And even if that man happens to be a well-respected or popular figure? So, again, it is very easy to become intoxicated with the sensation surrounding Rush Limbaugh right now \u2013 to pass him off as an aberration. But I think we must come to understand that, as the New York Times magazine was correct in saying, that one of the major human rights issues of the 21st century is ending violence against women and girls worldwide. That means we males have to evolve and redefine manhood in such a way that says, very clearly, that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with women and girls; we acknowledge and respect the equality of women and girls; and we will never again tolerate any gross disrespect, hatred, and violent acts toward women and girls. Because in abusing and degrading them, we are also ultimately abusing and degrading ourselves, too.",

      "bodyText": "After weeks of simmering hype, the rivalry between Jessica Ennis and Tatyana Chernova will finally come to the boil this Friday when the two of them go head-to-head in the pentathlon here in Istanbul. At 9.25am GMT the pair will step out on to the track for the opening event, the 60 metres hurdles. It will be the first time they have seen each other in person since they stood on the podium at the outdoor world championships in Daegu last August, but Ennis will not have forgotten her foe's face \u2013 she has had a photo of the Russian fixed in her mind's eye through the winter, and has been using it as motivation to prepare herself for their rematch. This pentathlon is a showdown that should come with an Ennio Morricone soundtrack to accompany the bang of the starter's gun. It is, along with Mo Farah's race against Bernard Lagat in the 3,000m, the most eagerly-awaited event of the World Indoor Championships. Chernova and Ennis are a mismatched pair, one a hulking blonde and the other a petite brunette. Both are in outstanding form. They have been checking out each other's performances online, noting each other's times and distances, calculating what each mark means in terms of pentathlon points. When Ennis knocked 0.08 sec off her personal best in the 60m hurdles on 18 February, Chernova responded six days later by cutting a full two-tenths of a second off her own best time in the event. As Ennis says, the two of them are pushing each other on. \"It is great to have that competition. I know when I am up against specialist hurdlers I can raise my game, it helps me bring my time down. So I hope that to have her and I battling it out can help me push my time down again and get some more points.\" The feeling is that the two of them are going to spur each other into breaking Irina Belova's world record for the pentathlon of 4,991 points, which has stood for 20 years. \"I got quite close to it last time in Doha,\" Ennis says, recalling her performance at the last world indoors, in 2010. \"It is going to take a PB to get it, but judging from the shape I am in and the shape the other girls are in it is something that any one of us could probably achieve.\" Both Ennis and Chernova have been quick and keen to talk about the \"other girls\" in the field. The Olympic champion, Natallia Dobrynska, has already broken her own Ukrainian national record this season, with a score of 4,880. And Chernova's Russian team-mate Ekaterina Bolshova \u2013 all but unknown to Ennis \u2013 has done better still, with 4,896 at the Russian championships. So the field is as strong as any in these championships, but there is no doubt that Ennis and Chernova take top billing. \"This is a strong fight,\" Chernova says. \"The winner will be the strongest.\" Ennis says, with a tinge of real relish in her voice, that she is \"definitely looking forward to that head-to-head\". So is Great Britain's head coach, Charles van Commenee. \"I am looking forward to that competition. The very best athletes are in the blocks, head-to-head, and that for me is what sport is about,\" Van Commenee said. \"For me it is the essence of sport. The best athletes against each other, that is what we are her for.\" So long as she clears them, Ennis will have an advantage after the morning's hurdles. She will expect to extend it in the next two events, the high jump and the shot put, as she is better than Chernova in both. The gain she makes there will be counterbalanced by the long jump later in the afternoon. Chernova's best distance so far this season is 6.61m, as opposed to Ennis's 6.47m, but the Russian has an outdoors PB of 6.82m, well beyond Ennis's capabilities. The competition looks as though it could come down to the final event, the 800m, which starts at 5.35pm GMT. Chernova has the edge there as well. As if the pentathlon itself were not an entertaining enough prospect, the Olympics is looming on the near horizon. Victory here, Ennis reckons, \"is going to be a massive psychological boost\". Her thoughts are fixed on the London Games. \"I want to have a great season but more than anything I want to be in the best shape I can possibly be going into London, injury free and healthy,\" Ennis says, casting her mind back to the ankle injury that caused her to pull out of the European Indoor Championships this time last year. \"So for me that is the most important thing, if I could ask for anything it'd just be to get all that training and preparation done and be fit and healthy on those two days.\" Chernova points out that one of her strongest events, the javelin, is not part of the pentathlon, \"so I have reserves for the Olympic Games\". Ennis could say the same about the 200m. Chernova believes that if she performs well in Istanbul that will prove she will be able to pick up ground on Ennis in the four events on the first day of the heptathlon, when she tends to be weaker than her rival. Do that, and she will capitalise on the second day, which includes the javelin and long jump. \"I dream, I have in my mind my gold medal, and I always believe I can win,\" Chernova says.

      "body": "<p>After weeks of simmering hype, the rivalry between Jessica Ennis and Tatyana Chernova will finally come to the boil this Friday when the two of them go head-to-head in the pentathlon here in Istanbul. At 9.25am GMT the pair will step out on to the track for the opening event, the 60 metres hurdles. It will be the first time they have seen each other in person since they stood on the podium at the outdoor world championships in Daegu last August, but Ennis will not have forgotten her foe's face \u2013 she has had a photo of the Russian fixed in her mind's eye through the winter, and has been using it as motivation to prepare herself for their rematch.</p> <p>This pentathlon is a showdown that should come with an Ennio Morricone soundtrack to accompany the bang of the starter's gun. It is, along with Mo Farah's race against Bernard Lagat in the 3,000m, the most eagerly-awaited event of the World Indoor Championships.</p> <p>Chernova and Ennis are a mismatched pair, one a hulking blonde and the other a petite brunette. Both are in outstanding form. They have been checking out each other's performances online, noting each other's times and distances, calculating what each mark means in terms of pentathlon points. When Ennis knocked 0.08 sec off her personal best in the 60m hurdles on 18 February, Chernova responded six days later by cutting a full two-tenths of a second off her own best time in the&#xa0;event.</p> <p>As Ennis says, the two of them are pushing each other on. \"It is great to have that competition. I know when I am up against specialist hurdlers I can raise my game, it helps me bring my time down. So I hope that to have her and I battling it out can help me push my time down again and get some more points.\"</p> <p>The feeling is that the two of them are going to spur each other into breaking Irina Belova's world record for the pentathlon of 4,991 points, which has stood for 20 years. \"I got quite close to it last time in Doha,\" Ennis says, recalling her performance at the last world indoors, in 2010. \"It is going to take a PB to get it, but judging from the shape I am in and the shape the other girls are in it is something that any one of us could probably achieve.\"</p> <p>Both Ennis and Chernova have been quick and keen to talk about the \"other girls\" in the field. The Olympic champion, Natallia Dobrynska, has already broken her own Ukrainian national record this season, with a score of 4,880. And Chernova's Russian team-mate Ekaterina Bolshova \u2013 all but unknown to Ennis \u2013 has done better still, with 4,896 at the Russian championships.</p> <p>So the field is as strong as any in these championships, but there is no doubt that Ennis and Chernova take top billing. \"This is a strong fight,\" Chernova says. \"The winner will be the strongest.\"</p> <p>Ennis says, with a tinge of real relish in her voice, that she is \"definitely looking forward to that head-to-head\".</p> <p>So is Great Britain's head coach, Charles van Commenee. \"I am looking forward to that competition. The very best athletes are in the blocks, head-to-head, and that for me is what sport is about,\" Van Commenee said. \"For me it is the essence of sport. The best athletes against each other, that is what we are her for.\"</p> <p>So long as she clears them, Ennis will have an advantage after the morning's hurdles. She will expect to extend it in the next two events, the high jump and the shot put, as she is better than Chernova in both. The gain she makes there will be counterbalanced by the long jump later in the afternoon. Chernova's best distance so far this season is 6.61m, as opposed to Ennis's 6.47m, but the Russian has an outdoors PB of 6.82m, well beyond Ennis's capabilities.</p> <p>The competition looks as though it could come down to the final event, the 800m, which starts at 5.35pm GMT. Chernova has the edge there as well.</p> <p>As if the pentathlon itself were not an entertaining enough prospect, the Olympics is looming on the near horizon. Victory here, Ennis reckons, \"is going to be a massive psychological boost\".</p> <p>Her thoughts are fixed on the London Games. \"I want to have a great season but more than anything I want to be in the best shape I can possibly be going into London, injury free and healthy,\" Ennis says, casting her mind back to the ankle injury that caused her to pull out of the European Indoor Championships this time last year.</p> <p>\"So for me that is the most important thing, if I could ask for anything it'd just be to get all that training and preparation done and be fit and healthy on those two&#xa0;days.\"</p> <p>Chernova points out that one of her strongest events, the javelin, is not part of the pentathlon, \"so I have reserves for the Olympic Games\". Ennis could say the same about the 200m. Chernova believes that if she performs well in Istanbul that will prove she will be able to pick up ground on Ennis in the four events on the first day of the heptathlon, when she tends to be weaker than her rival. Do that, and she will capitalise on the second day, which includes the javelin and long jump. \"I dream, I have in my mind my gold medal, and I always believe I can win,\" Chernova says. And so does Ennis.</p> <p>Only one of them can be right. That, as Van Commenee says, is the essence of sport. This rivalry which will unfold in Istanbul is going to run through the year, and should captivate sports fans of every stripe, type, creed and colour.</p> <h2>Highlights in the schedule</h2> <p>(finals bolded; all times GMT)</p> <p><strong>Friday 9 March</strong></p> <p>9.25am Pentathlon 1st event: 60m hurdles (British interest, Jess Ennis, defending champion)</p> <p>3pm Women's 60m hurdles 1st round (British interest, Tiffany Porter)</p> <p>3.35pm Men's 60m 1st round (Dwain Chambers, defending champion)</p> <p>5.05pm Men's 3000m 1st round (Mo Farah)</p> <p><strong>5.35pm Pentathlon final event: 800m</strong></p> <p><strong>Saturday 10 March</strong></p> <p>8.10am Women's 60m 1st round (Asha Philip, Jodie Williams)</p> <p>9.25am Men's high jump qualifiers (Robbie Grabarz, Samson Oni)</p> <p><strong>3.05pm Women's triple jump final</strong> (Yamile Aldama)</p> <p>3.10pm Women's 60m hurdles semis</p> <p>3.30pm Men's 60m semi-finals</p> <p><strong>5.45pm Women's 60m hurdles final</strong></p> <p><strong>6pm Men's 60m final</strong></p> <p><strong>Sunday 11 March</strong></p> <p><strong>12pm Women's pole vault</strong> (Holly Bleasdale)</p> <p><strong>1.10pm Men's 3000m final</strong></p> <p><strong>1.30pm Men's high jump final</strong></p> <p><strong>2.40pm Women's 4x400m relay</strong></p> <p><strong>3.40pm Men's 4x400m relay</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Haroon Lorgat, the outgoing International Cricket Council president, has warned that the threat of match-fixing has moved from the international game to domestic cricket. Against the backdrop of the conviction of the former Essex bowler Mervyn Westfield, Lorgat said improved regulation of international cricket had forced the problem on to the domestic game. \"What we're finding now is there's not much going on around the international game,\" he said. \"It's moved. So my own experience from back in South Africa is: secure your own home. \"You can talk about the cautions we've given and each of the member boards have their own units.\" Lorgat is due to step down as president and chief executive of the ICC in June but could stay on until after the ICC World Twenty20 tournament in September if no successor is found. He urged others to follow the model established by the England and Wales Cricket Board, which he said was \"already out of the starting blocks\". \"They've got their domestic anti-corruption code, they've got the access unit. You've got to be careful about the high-profile leagues in the domestic game,\" said Lorgat, attending the Havas Global Sports Forum in Barcelona. In the wake of the spot-fixing allegations in the summer of 2010 that led to prison sentences for Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt, the ICC unanimously agreed that all domestic boards should have an anti-corruption code that mirrors that of the IOC. Lorgat said that he was convinced that they had made real progress against corruption in international cricket over the past 18 months. \"I genuinely believe we're stronger now than 18 months ago. I genuinely believe we've dealt with it pretty well,\" he said. \"Until they regulate the illegal market \u2013 the best we can do is influence and exert as much pressure as we can. But we can't play the role of governments and legislate and bring in regulations.\" The ICC is conducting an independent evaluation of whether to bid to become an Olympic sport. Lorgat said the potential benefits were obvious but that it was important not to \"jump in feet first\".",

      "bodyText": "Paul will be here from 8pm or whenever the City match finishes. In the meantime why not read our preview of tonight's game: Sir Alex Ferguson has warned Manchester United must \"waken up\" from their European malaise at Old Trafford or risk a second early exit of the season when they face Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League on Thursday night. United have toiled at home in European competition all season and almost compounded their failure in the Champions League group phase by falling to Ajax on their debut in the Europa League. The Amsterdam club's 2-1 win in the last-32 second-leg ended an 11-game undefeated home run for Ferguson's team in Europe and the Dutch side needed only one more goal to progress at United's expense despite trailing 3-0 on aggregate after six minutes at Old Trafford. The result also left United with only one win from four home European matches this term, and Ferguson admits a vast improvement is required against Marcelo Bielsa's impressive side. Read the entire story here. Preamble on the fly: Just teleported from Lisbon to Old Trafford so allow me a moment to reconstitute myself. While I do that, perhaps the United fans amongst you could cobble together an answer to this question: would you prefer City to crach out against Sporting Lisbon in this round or to meet them yourselves in the final? (I ask that there is a good chance a Bilbao victory will make it redundant later?) Man Utd: De Gea, Rafael Da Silva, Smalling, Evans, Evra, Park, Jones, Giggs, Young, Rooney, Hernandez. Subs: Amos, Ferdinand, Anderson, Carrick, Nani, Welbeck, Fabio Da Silva. Athletic Bilbao: Iraizoz, Iraola, Javi Martinez, San Jose, Aurtenetxe, Iturraspe, De Marcos, Ander Herrera, Susaeta, Llorente, Muniain. Subs: Raul, Toquero, David Lopez, Koikili, Inigo Perez, Ekiza, Ibai. Referee: Florian Meyer (Germany) 2 min: Bilbao, dressed like Glentoran, make their intentions clear right from the off, going for United's jugular. There's zip and precision to their play and United are struggling to get a touch. 3 min: No sooner do United get the ball than they create a prime chance, but Giggs' shot from 10 yards is blocked by San Jos\u00e9. 4 min: This is a great opening to the game, and amid a superb-sounding atmosphere to boot. Llorente almost sends the already-boisterous visiting contingent into raptures by holding off Smalling and flashing a curling drive just past the post from the edge of the box. 7 min: Freekick to United in a good crossing position on the right after Aurtenetxe pulls back Young. Giggs curls it into the danger zone but Iraizoz, unlike Joe Hart earlier today, punches decisively away. 9 min: This is rip-roaring stuff, with both sides going at each other like basketball teams, taking it in turns to attack. Rooney just slipped Park through with a canny reverse pass but Bilbao converged on the Korean to close out the chance. 12 min: Rooney is looking good early doors, constantly coming deep to play incisive balls. In other news, you may have read about the United fanzine Red Issue contemplating suing police. You might also like to read Red Issue's editoral explaining their thinking. 15 min: After an exhilarating opening the match has become a tad ragged, but the intent of both teams' remains admirably positive. So we've either got a classic on our hands or a chaotic thrillride. Or both. Or a mess. 18 min: Any United fans getting flashbacks watching this Llorente lad? He has a touch of Van Nistelrooy about him. 19 min: Iraizoz races out of his box to head clear a through-ball before Rooney could connect with it. 20 min: United are seriously rattled here and should have conceded a penalty a moment ago when Smalling tugged back Llorente in the box. But the ref gave a free the other way instead. \"Re: your question in the preamble: It's easy,\" gaps Matt Exton. \"City go all the way but lose the final and Utd crash out now and focus on League. Let's skelp City in the league and take the title.\" GOAL! United 1-0 Bilbao (Rooney 22') United had been reeling for most of the previous 20 minutes by the speed, precision and the sheer numerical force of Bilbao's attack. But then they strike back with a splendid goal. Giggs scampered into the box and nudged the ball through to Hernandez, who twisted and turned trickly before firing a wicked low shot at goal. Iraizoz dived low to save well but Rooney follwed up to prod the rebound into the net! That won't be the last of the scoring tonight. 25 min: Young aborts a promising United attack with a wayward pass. It was intended for Hernandez, who would have been clean through. 27 min: Corner to Athletic. Susaeta takes. It's poor. So poor that Evans clears. 29 min: This match is so fast the players should be clad into those Formula 1 driver suits rather than jerseys. Llorente will score tonight. He's just gone close again with a decent header that flew just over. \"That was a superb save from the Bilbao keeper before Rooney tucked away the rebound,\" gulps Francis Lee. \"Has the Guardian ever had a Youtube special of ace saves consigned to the dusty archives for ultimately failing to prevent a goal being scored?\" Don't remember, but probably. Google it, man, Google it. 32 min: Just as their team is being largely ourtplayed, United fans are being outshouted and outsung ... and now, as United finally enjoy a bout of possession, outwhistled. 33 min: What a miss! That should have been 1-1! Susaeta got the jump on the dozing Evans to race on to a clipped pass over the top. De Gea came surging off his line to block but had no chance of getting there and basically just invited the elementary lob ... but Susaeta lifted it over him and wide! 36 min: United are being given the run-around here. Bilbao really are a delight; they attack with such speed and numbers that at times they look capable of blowing United apart. It is a minor miracle that they are not yet level, at least. Well, maybe not a miracle: the truth is that their finishing has not been of the same level as the build-ups. Iraola offered an example just now as, with four players awaiting a pull-back, he chose to shoot from a narrow angle, allowing De Gea to fob it behind for a corner. 40 min: After withstanding more battering from Bilbao, United break forward and Rooney launches a long cross towards Hernandez, but Iraizoz intercepts with all the mean authority of a vigilant customs officer. 42 min: Fine work again by Rooney, who is the principal conduit of United's counter-attacks. But again his cross is cut out before it could reach Hernandez. GOAL! United 1-1 Bilbao (Llorente 44') That was inevitable. And it was excellent. The highly impressive Llorente collected the ball at the edge of the area, held it up well and then shunted it wide to Suasaeta. The centreforward then darted into the area to receive the ensuing cross as Phil Jones stood and stared, and then sent an emphatic diving header past De Gea from eight yards. Half-time: What an exhilarating half of football! Bilbao are giving United a proper seeing-to, though the hosts have also attacked with menace when given the chance. Bilbao have the away goal that complicates United's chances of progressing but they certainly do not seem inclined to settle for that and look perfectly capable of scoring a couple more tonight. You get the feeling United will have to do likewise. David De Gea is apparently a big Metallica fan. He may, therefore, appreciate this Bilbao performance, which could only be accurately soundtracked by this (skip the ad). Right on: \"Athletico come from the notoriously uncompetitive Spanish league, but even if they are playing like a lower-level High-speed Barcelona clone, they're looking every part the equal of the premiership's second best team,\" thunders Ben Dunn. \"The lesser teams in the premiership clone passion and aggression and couldn't live with this side.\" 46 min: United get the second half going. Ferguson presumably gave them the hairdryer treatment at half - but given that their heads were probably already spinning from the Bilbao onslaught, what good can that do? \"On the subject of great saves leading to goals, I seem to remember Bob Wilson saying his greatest save was in a Cup final (I think) when he tipped the goal round the post for a corner, which was promptly played in and ended up in the back of the net,\" recalls John davis. \"He still seemed to have an air of wistful bitterness forty years on, if that is possible.\" 47 min: More pandemonium in the United box as again Bilbao throw in as many attackers as there were defenders. After a couple of blocked shots. however, united manage to scramble it away. 49 min: Smart save from De Gea to tip away a 20-yard drive fropm Munian. Bilbao continue to batter their hosts. 51 min: Smalling strides out of defence and into the Bilbao half. But in the face of the ferocious Bilbao pressing is forced to turn around and pass the ball all the way back to De Gea. 52 min: Bilbao are threatening more quickly than I can type! Moments after they sliced United apart only for Llorente to blast wide from 10 yards, they do so again, and this time De Gea is forced into another flying save. Without him United would be on course for humiliation. They may still get there. 54 min: United are down to 10 men after Smalling walks off the pitch, seemingly injured, and Carrick gets dressed with a view to coming on. In your own time, Michael. 56 min: Some respite for United, in the form of a freekick about 25 yards from Bilbao's goal. Rooney curls a reasonable effort wide. 58 min: Two minutes without a Bilbao shot: United are improving. meanwhile, the Llorente fan club is growing: \"At long last a proper big lad up front who can not only head the ball into the net, but can also hold it up and knock the centre-halves over without looking clumsy,\" cooes Ian Burch. \"I thought these type of strikers were extinct. Go on big fella, put yourself about.\" Let's see now, if Andy Carroll is worth \u00a335m, that makes Llorente worth how much? 60 min: Suasaeta dinks in a freekick. Evans heads up in the air. It falls to a Bilbao player (not sure how) but he smashes it over the bar from 14 yards. 62 min: You have to admire United for hanging in there and continuing to use the scraps of possession to piece together dangerous moves of their own. Hernandez should have done better with a chance just now but dawdled before shooting, and Giggs then troubled the visitors with a jinking run into the box before being bustled back out of it. 64 min: San Jos\u00e9 booked for bringing down Hernandez after the Mexican and turned nimbly past him. 65 min: United substitution: Park off, Anderson on. Ferguson is trying to bolster midfield to stem the flow towards United's goal. 68 min: That would have been a brilliant goal! But again Bilbao were denied by De Gea. Muniain showed tremendous close control and trickery to beat two defenders and then exchange a neat one-two, but De Gea turned his shot out for a corner. 70 min: Carrick has made a difference to United since coming on, giving them a degree of composed steadiness in midfield. But still Bilbao look like unhingeing them every time they regain the ball. GOAL! United 1-2 Bilbao (De Marcos 72') That's a beautiful goal, thoroughly in keeping with one of the most impressive away performances at Old Trafford in recent memory. After rapid tiki-taka around the United box, Herrera lifted the ball into the path of the in-rushing De Marcus, who swept it emphatically into the net. He may have been in an offside position when he started his run but if he was that minor injustice makes up for the injustice of Bilbao not already being in the lead before now. Sort of. 75 min: United change: Giggs off, Nani on. A pertinent point by Jan Lofgren: \"Who needs Champions League when the Europa League is giving us games like this?\" It has been a belter. 76 min: Rooney attempts to recreate Young's second goal against Spurs from the weekend, but fails. 78 min: Dangerous cross by Nani, well dealt with by Martinez. Bilbao: winning friends and inlfuencing people. \"I though La Liga was a poor league with just two decent teams - I was wrong?\" confesses Bob McNutt. \"This lot are like Bar\u00e7a on speed. A joy to watch. They deserve a standing ovation fat Ronaldo style at the final whistle.\" Ol\u00e9 to that. 80 min: Spanking drive by Rooney from 30 yards. Well held by the keeper. 81 min: Bilbao substitution: Llorente gets a well deserved ovation after a dominant display. He is replaced by Toquero. In other news, as ITV discuss Bilbao's second goal it becomes clear that Graham taylor, who used to manage England, doesn't know the offside law. 83 min: Fittingly, United's best player tonight has been a Spaniard (but not a Basque, admittedlty). De Gea has jsut been forced to make another fine one-handed save, this time from Toquero after a lightning Bilbao break. 85 min: Young clambers all over Martinez, conceding a freekick on half-way. Bilbao build anew. No sign of United getting an equaliser here. \"Spanish teams only look bad compared to Barca and Real,\" snorts Chris Cherry. \"They're still streets ahead of English teams right now.\" 88 min: For the first time in the evening Bilbao are sitting deep, seemingly content to hold on for 2-1. But they are defending as diligently as they had been attacking and United can't get close to the danger zone. \"I saw Bilbao play Barca a few years ago,\" announces Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riain. \"At the time they were third in La Liga, only 25 points or so off the lead. But for the ten minutes or so Barca let them have the ball they looked really, really good. Then Barca brought Xavi on and they Bilbao never got the ball again.\" So what you're saying is, United should bring on, um, Danny Welbeck? GOAL! United 1-3 Bilbao (90') That is another glorious goal! Evans and Jones colided with each other in the air, allowing De Marcos to race through and draw another save from De Gea. The goalkeeper couldn't hold it - he should have - and Rafael didn't seem aware that the ball was in his vicinity so just watched as the excellente Munian raced in at fired into the net! GOAL! United 2-3 Bilbao (Rooney, pen, 90+2 min) Rooney sends the keeper the wrong way from the spot after De Marcos handled, giving the game a scoreline that flatters United. Full-time: That was a bona fide thriller. Bilbao put on a performance that has seldom been equalled by an away team at Old Trafford, blowing the hosts apart. Only repeated saves by De Gea and United's characteristic refusal to buckle prevented this tie from being over. It sets up a mouth-watering return leg. On today's evidence, anyone hoping for an all-Manchester Europa League final is going to be disappointed. And anyone who thinks the Premier League is the best in the world is wrong. And anyone who thinks the Europa League is a rubbish tournament is also wrong. So there.",

Iraola offered an example just now as, with four players awaiting a pull-back, he chose to shoot from a narrow angle, allowing De Gea to fob it behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> After withstanding more battering from Bilbao, United break forward and Rooney launches a long cross towards Hernandez, but Iraizoz intercepts with all the mean authority of a vigilant customs officer.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Fine work again by Rooney, who is the principal conduit of United's counter-attacks. But again his cross is cut out before it could reach Hernandez.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL! United 1-1 Bilbao (Llorente 44')</strong> That was inevitable. And it was excellent. The highly impressive Llorente collected the ball at the edge of the area, held it up well and then shunted it wide to Suasaeta. The centreforward then darted into the area to receive the ensuing cross as Phil Jones stood and stared, and then sent an emphatic diving header past De Gea from eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> What an exhilarating half of football! Bilbao are giving United a proper seeing-to, though the hosts have also attacked with menace when given the chance. Bilbao have the away goal that complicates United's chances of progressing but they certainly do not seem inclined to settle for that and look perfectly capable of scoring a couple more tonight. You get the feeling United will have to do likewise.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>David De Gea</strong> is apparently a big Metallica fan. He may, therefore, appreciate this Bilbao performance, which could only be accurately soundtracked by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ7Aif5aXlQ\">this</a> (skip the ad).</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Right on:</strong> \"Athletico come from the notoriously uncompetitive Spanish league, but even if they are playing like a lower-level High-speed Barcelona clone, they're looking every part the equal of the premiership's second best team,\" thunders Ben Dunn. \"The lesser teams in the premiership clone passion and aggression and couldn't live with this side.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> United get the second half going. Ferguson presumably gave them the hairdryer treatment at half - but given that their heads were probably already spinning from the Bilbao onslaught, what good can that do? \"On the subject of great saves leading to goals, I seem to remember Bob Wilson saying his greatest save was in a Cup final (I think) when he tipped the goal round the post for a corner, which was promptly played in and ended up in the back of the net,\" recalls John davis. \"He still seemed to have an air of wistful bitterness forty years on, if that is possible.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> More pandemonium in the United box as again Bilbao throw in as many attackers as there were defenders. After a couple of blocked shots. however, united manage to scramble it away.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Smart save from De Gea to tip away a 20-yard drive fropm Munian. Bilbao continue to batter their hosts.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Smalling strides out of defence and into the Bilbao half. But in the face of the ferocious Bilbao pressing is forced to turn around and pass the ball all the way back to De Gea.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Bilbao are threatening more quickly than I can type! Moments after they sliced United apart only for Llorente to blast wide from 10 yards, they do so again, and this time De Gea is forced into another flying save. Without him United would be on course for humiliation. They may still get there.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> United are down to 10 men after Smalling walks off the pitch, seemingly injured, and Carrick gets dressed with a view to coming on. In your own time, Michael.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Some respite for United, in the form of a freekick about 25 yards from Bilbao's goal. Rooney curls a reasonable effort wide.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Two minutes without a Bilbao shot: United are improving. meanwhile, the Llorente fan club is growing: \"At long last a proper big lad up front who can not only head the ball into the net, but can also hold it up and knock the centre-halves over without looking clumsy,\" cooes Ian Burch. \"I thought these type of strikers were extinct. Go on big fella, put yourself about.\" Let's see now, if Andy Carroll is worth \u00a335m, that makes Llorente worth how much?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Suasaeta dinks in a freekick. Evans heads up in the air. It falls to a Bilbao player (not sure how) but he smashes it over the bar from 14 yards.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> You have to admire United for hanging in there and continuing to use the scraps of possession to piece together dangerous moves of their own. Hernandez should have done better with a chance just now but dawdled before shooting, and Giggs then troubled the visitors with a jinking run into the box before being bustled back out of it.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> San Jos\u00e9 booked for bringing down Hernandez after the Mexican and turned nimbly past him.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> United substitution: Park off, Anderson on. Ferguson is trying to bolster midfield to stem the flow towards United's goal.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> That would have been a brilliant goal! But again Bilbao were denied by De Gea. Muniain showed tremendous close control and trickery to beat two defenders and then exchange a neat one-two, but De Gea turned his shot out for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Carrick has made a difference to United since coming on, giving them a degree of composed steadiness in midfield. But still Bilbao look like unhingeing them every time they regain the ball.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>GOAL! United 1-2 Bilbao (De Marcos 72')</strong> That's a beautiful goal, thoroughly in keeping with one of the most impressive away performances at Old Trafford in recent memory. After rapid tiki-taka around the United box, Herrera lifted the ball into the path of the in-rushing De Marcus, who swept it emphatically into the net. He may have been in an offside position when he started his run but if he was that minor injustice makes up for the injustice of Bilbao not already being in the lead before now. Sort of.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> United change: Giggs off, Nani on. A pertinent point by Jan Lofgren: \"Who needs Champions League when the Europa League is giving us games like this?\" It has been a belter.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Rooney attempts to recreate Young's second goal against Spurs from the weekend, but fails.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Dangerous cross by Nani, well dealt with by Martinez. Bilbao: winning friends and inlfuencing people. \"I though La Liga was a poor league with just two decent teams - I was wrong?\" confesses Bob McNutt. \"This lot are like Bar\u00e7a on speed. A joy to watch. They deserve a standing ovation fat Ronaldo style at the final whistle.\" Ol\u00e9 to that.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Spanking drive by Rooney from 30 yards. Well held by the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Bilbao substitution: Llorente gets a well deserved ovation after a dominant display. He is replaced by Toquero. In other news, as ITV discuss Bilbao's second goal it becomes clear that Graham taylor, who used to manage England, doesn't know the offside law.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Fittingly, United's best player tonight has been a Spaniard (but not a Basque, admittedlty). De Gea has jsut been forced to make another fine one-handed save, this time from Toquero after a lightning Bilbao break.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Young clambers all over Martinez, conceding a freekick on half-way. Bilbao build anew. No sign of United getting an equaliser here. \"Spanish teams only look bad compared to Barca and Real,\" snorts Chris Cherry. \"They're still streets ahead of English teams right now.\"</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> For the first time in the evening Bilbao are sitting deep, seemingly content to hold on for 2-1. But they are defending as diligently as they had been attacking and United can't get close to the danger zone. \"I saw Bilbao play Barca a few years ago,\" announces Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riain. \"At the time they were third in La Liga, only 25 points or so off the lead. But for the ten minutes or so Barca let them have the ball they looked really, really good. Then Barca brought Xavi on and they Bilbao never got the ball again.\" So what you're saying is, United should bring on, um, Danny Welbeck?</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>GOAL! United 1-3 Bilbao (90')</strong> That is another glorious goal! Evans and Jones colided with each other in the air, allowing De Marcos to race through and draw another save from De Gea. The goalkeeper couldn't hold it - he should have - and Rafael didn't seem aware that the ball was in his vicinity so just watched as the excellente Munian raced in at fired into the net!</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>GOAL! United 2-3 Bilbao (Rooney, pen, 90+2 min)</strong> Rooney sends the keeper the wrong way from the spot after De Marcos handled, giving the game a scoreline that flatters United.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> That was a bona fide thriller. Bilbao put on a performance that has seldom been equalled by an away team at Old Trafford, blowing the hosts apart. Only repeated saves by De Gea and United's characteristic refusal to buckle prevented this tie from being over. It sets up a mouth-watering return leg. On today's evidence, anyone hoping for an all-Manchester Europa League final is going to be disappointed. And anyone who thinks the Premier League is the best in the world is wrong. And anyone who thinks the Europa League is a rubbish tournament is also wrong. So there.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When I joined the Liberal party 26 years ago it was because, in my gut, the Liberals seemed the right people to me. Over the last quarter of a century, particularly in these last 22 months, I've been proved right. When the Tories have had to \"do difficult things\" \u2013 when they closed the mines, the steelworks and the shipyards \u2013 do you think they felt bad about it? No. When Labour invaded Iraq, introduced tuition fees, clobbered the poor by scrapping the 10p tax rate or let the bankers off the leash, wrecking the economy \u2013 did they feel bad? I doubt it. But here we are, the Lib Dems, in government taking difficult decisions to rescue our country from the abyss, and we spend our time feeling guilty and beating ourselves up. Do you know what that proves? It proves that we are human, it proves we are decent, that there is something in our DNA as a party that means Lib Dems acquire and retain a conscience. That's nice. But now it's time for us to stop feeling guilty. We took power because the alternative was a Tory minority government, a snap election and then a Tory majority government. As a party in government we've fought like tigers to win tax cuts for the poor, to protect our NHS, to green our economy, to kick Trident into the long grass, to remain at the heart of Europe and to reform our democracy. We have made more difference to this country in the last two years than we made in the previous 65 years. And if you want further proof of this, just look to the health bill. With 140 amendments, most of which came from the Lib Dems, it is no longer the bill Lansley dreamed of. Had we not joined the coalition, his bill would have been passed into law unamended last spring. I'm not going to pretend that the bill is perfect, it isn't. For one, it would have never happened had Guardian readers held their nerve and voted Lib Dem to give us a majority in 2010. But the alleged privatisation in the bill is not there anymore, and that is only down to the Lib Dems' tenacity, from the party's grassroots to the Lords. Our last spring conference is where Andrew Lansley's ambitions came off the rails \u2013 the votes of members stopped the original bill in its tracks. No other party has the internal democracy to allow this. It's worth reflecting that had Labour been forced to share power with the Lib Dems when it rammed through its 2006 NHS Act, it would not then have been able to throw the NHS to the wolves of the marketplace, as it did. I take very seriously the criticisms made of the current bill by those in the health professions and wish the government had acted sooner to heed them but I find it hard to take seriously Labour's critique when it introduced privatisation and marketisation into our NHS. I sat next to Andy Burnham in a debate the other week and was astonished to hear him rail against NHS privatisation (which isn't happening) when, as secretary of state for health, he presided over the privatisation of my local surgical department and my GP out-of-hours service, to name but two. At this year's spring conference the NHS will be the subject of many discussions. Whether these will take place on the main conference floor I can't tell you \u2013 the leadership doesn't stage manage our conferences, unlike other parties \u2013 but you will know that our membership will have its say, and will be listened to by the leader. But there is one thing that many Lib Dems must start to understand. When you join a political party, you must accept that ending up in power is an occupational hazard. We are in power now, sharing government with a party that unashamedly favours their people, the millionaires. It's a serious business, so it's time we focused on our people \u2013 the millions who are not millionaires. That's why the biggest battles are around the budget \u2013 winning a tax cut for the least well-off, rather than handouts for the wealthy. With just 23% of the vote, we've got three-quarters of our manifesto into government policy. Let's focus on that success, and stop apologising for the quarter we didn't get. The outstanding results we've been having in local by-elections recently remind us that we are more than capable of making our own luck. The Gateshead conference will see a renewal of that self belief, and a continuation of the grassroots reminding those of us in leadership positions that they are the ones in charge.

This latest movie starts with a bold and intriguing concept, but is bafflingly muted and underpowered, its initial promise fading as it drifts away to a self-conscious conclusion. Trishna is a Thomas Hardy adaptation \u2013 Winterbottom's third, in fact, having made Jude in 1996 and The Claim (based on The Mayor of Casterbridge) in 2000. It is a loose reworking of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, and the story is transplanted to modern India where Jay (Riz Ahmed), the son of a rich Jaipur hotelier, is travelling with friends. One evening Jay is captivated by the delicate beauty of a young woman he sees at a party: this is Trishna, played by Freida Pinto. She comes from a poor family, and her father, a delivery driver, plunges the family into poverty by driving half-asleep on India's hair-raising roads and crashing his jeep. (It's a smart twist on one of the novel's most famous scenes.) The infatuated Jay hears about Trishna's plight and gets her a job at his dad's luxury hotel; and so begins a fateful relationship. Any Hardy reader will find himself tipped off balance by the challenge in Winterbottom's bold opening. All the stuff about the father of Tess/Trishna and his delusions of family grandeur is jettisoned in favour of a fast, fluid introduction that actually centres on Jay: rich, a little conceited, but quite decent and high-minded. Wait: is he supposed to be Alec d'Urberville or Angel Clare? An interesting ambiguity, but like so much else in the movie, it seems to get slowly but surely poured away into the story's damp sand. There is tragedy and violence, perhaps attributable to thwarted ambition: although both find themselves in the hotel business, Jay has dreams of being in Bollywood and Trishna is a talented dancer. Their dreams are soured and their life and love are on a tragically wrong track. Yet something prevents Ahmed and Pinto from expressing these emotions powerfully and satisfyingly enough, and Pinto never quite shows that her character is changed by what she has gone through. The story is rather shapeless, with little dramatic traction: it feels as if it could end at the one-hour mark or go on for another four. Winterbottom's location work in Jaipur and Mumbai has richness and spectacle, but somehow this does not come fully to life.",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes they have to lie. As the British death toll in Afghanistan rises past 400, every news item tells of reverses, mistakes and a desperation to withdraw. Someone has to hold the line. Those whose job is to fight and possibly die for their country need to believe they do so for a purpose. A nation bidding them to die needs it too. Hence the prime minister has to assert the six-year attempt to cleanse Taliban from Helmand province as \"vital to our national security\", when everyone knows that this is absurd. The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, has to say: \"We owe it to the all too many who have sacrificed their lives to see this mission successfully concluded.\" The chief of the defence staff, Sir David Richards, has to claim that \"truly impressive\" progress has been made, and \"We will hold our nerve\". The former head of the army, Sir Richard Dannatt, asserts that we have \"exposed al-Qaida's cynical manipulation of Islam, and so made the UK and the west safer\". The general on the ground, James Bucknall, says that \"now is not the time to blink\". So far, so obligatory. But the impression is of a speak-your-war machine that has has lost any contact with reality. Preparing the nation for defeat may require the phoney oratory of national security. But when the trumpets and drums depart, the country is left with grim facts. Far more true was Thursday's remark of a service widow, Wendy Rayner, who protested that, after this is all over, \"the poor people who are left will go back to the same crappy lifestyle that they had before our lot went in\". General Richards declares that the Afghanistan operations \"did not start out of nothing, or from vainglorious adventure, they were triggered by a terrorist atrocity which still casts a shadow over our world\" \u2013 a world united, he said, in the need to remove the perpetrators of 9/11 from their bolt hole in Afghanistan. Although they were only a \"fringe movement\", they were still a threat. The threat would continue, said the general, as long as Afghanistan lacked \"institutions that ensure a country can govern and take responsibility for itself\". Therefore British arms should create such institutions. These assertions are empty of meaning, sent to smithereens by the blast of an exploding Warrior. They have been trotted out for a decade in Afghanistan, along with the usual drivel of corners being turned and lights at the end of tunnels. States hate other states bossing them about, and hate it more the longer the bossing continues, especially when done with the cruelty and incompetence on daily display in Afghanistan. They give support to anti-occupation insurgents, and resent being told by pompous generals that such support endangers the \"national security\" of distant peoples. The war the Taliban fighters are waging with vigour and success is to regain the integrity of Afghanistan, no more or less. The postimperial claim that a Taliban Afghanistan poses an existential threat to Britain is so daft that only very intelligent men would dare try it on a public they regard as stupid. Osama bin Laden pulled off a coup on 9/11, but it never threatened any state as a nation. And if anyone or anything can take credit for it not being repeated, it is domestic security, not Nato's global reach. If anything, the much vaunted safety of Britain's streets has been diminished by Tony Blair's obsessive wars against Islamic states. Look round fortress London. The reason British troops are still dying in Afghanistan is because a shocked Bush administration felt in 2001 that it had to fight someone to avenge the humiliation of 9/11. It did so not in a futile attempt to eradicate \"bolt holes\" (which can be anywhere) but as a retaliatory class action against a country too weak to fight back. It had all the subtlety of the Third Crusade. Rather than counsel restraint, Britain recklessly joined in, and an unemployed Nato did likewise. The price has been paid by the poorest people on earth, but even America can now ill afford the $100bn a year it is costing. Meanwhile, Afghanistan is most certainly fighting back. There is no conceivable reason for Britain to remain in Afghanistan. The Afghan army and police are unable to assert Kabul's control over the country, and thus offer any reassurance that there will be no bolt holes. Pakistan is blatantly pursuing its own Afghan agenda, now in alliance with the Taliban. Their reported dominance over more and more provinces is a wretched comment on 10 years of campaigning by the world's most sophisticated military powers. Even in the capital, Kabul, foreigners can no longer roam free outside their fortified enclaves. Britain desperately needs to engineer a dignified retreat. It does not own Afghanistan, and Afghanistan is not its business. The ambition to bring Afghanistan democracy, security and gender awareness was unjustified and has failed. Its internal government is for Afghans (and their neighbours) to ordain, and is not a feasible task for British soldiers and taxpayers. Even now, British strategy is puzzling. Aid is being poured into the country, much of it stolen, wasted or departing in suitcases on the next plane to Dubai. Both Britain and America have signalled their exit by 2014, leaving Afghans to make peace with whomever they regard as the enemy. Meanwhile, American marines are planning to leave Helmand this summer, which puts British soldiers back in an exposed position, mentoring an unreliable Kabul army to keep Pashtun fighters at bay. The prospect is of a retreat as depressing as from Basra in 2007, with local troops expected to continue a civil war that Nato began. Everyone knows the Taliban will just take over. The one hope now is that those in authority and with influence over authority (which includes the media) might stop lying. The language of reassurance may be needed by troops at the front, given the obscenity of their continuing to die for a pointless cause. Greater assurance would come from knowing that such language does not privately deceive those using it in public, those responsible for this defeat. When, as must be the case, there is a Chilcot-style inquiry into the Afghan fiasco, leaders of Labour and Conservative governments have serious explaining to do. They must explain not just what they did but what they said they were doing, and why. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "One of the more interesting media narratives that's developing around the Republican presidential contest over the past few months \u2013 seemingly confirmed by Super Tuesday's results \u2013 is that Mitt Romney hasn't sealed the deal with the conservative base of the Republican party. A look at a map of Ohio illustrates what that story is trying to tell. On the left, you see a map of the 2008 Barack Obama-John McCain results; and on the right, you see a map of yesterday's primary results. What you'll notice for the most part is that the counties Obama won then (blue), Mitt Romney is winning now (orange). The counties McCain won (red) have become Rick Santorum counties (green). Romney is relying on his strength in urban and suburban areas, while Santorum is taking exurban and rural regions. Many in the media are trying to paint Romney's lack of strength in traditional Republican areas as a weakness. And yes, I'm sure Romney would prefer to be winning among all groups. But consider the alternative: he could be capturing the nomination by emerging victorious only among conservatives and in \"traditional Republican\" areas. Would that be better? The evidence suggests that it wouldn't be. Consider one of the biggest thorns in Mitt Romney's side: Sarah Palin. While not endorsing any candidate, Palin has repeatedly called for the Republican nomination process to drag on through forever \u2013 and she voted for Newt Gingrich on Tuesday. Yet, she dislikes Obama so much that she has promised to support the Republican nominee, whoever he may be, in the fall. Polling indicates Palin is not alone. Have a look at the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, in which 89% of Republican primary voters said they would vote for Romney. In fact, the percentage who said they would vote for Romney enthusiastically is actually up 7 percentage points since October, albeit that it is still very low at 45%. This compares with only 81% of Republican primary voters saying they would for Rick Santorum, of which only 42% would do so enthusiastically. This 89% Republican support is right around the percentage that George W Bush won in 2000 and 2004. Many Republicans are worried that although Romney might win Republicans who turn out to vote, he won't boost Republican turnout as Bush did. Indeed, turnout has been down in a number of primary states (though it was up in Ohio) suggesting enthusiasm among Republicans is also down. That may be because Republicans don't love their choices, but that seems unlikely to affect the fall election. Republicans have maintained a lead in the Gallup enthusiasm gap over the Democrats for the 2012 fall elections, despite the \"drawn out\" Republican nomination process. With conservative voters seemingly locked down, the Republican party would likely benefit from a candidate who, comparatively speaking, has the greatest appeal to the middle of the electorate. That seems to be Mitt Romney. In state after state, Romney is doing better among moderates than any other candidate. In the state of Ohio, Romney actually lost conservatives by 6 points, but he won the state because he led among moderates and liberals by 14 points. In Florida, he only won conservatives by 4 points, but he won moderates by 39 points. Romney's also winning key fall swing counties in the primary. In Ohio, he won Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, by 20 points. Hamilton was won by Bush by 5 points when he took the state by 2 points in 2004, while Obama took it by 7 points when he emerged victorious in the Buckeye State by 4.6 points in 2008. In Florida, Romney swept the swing I-4 corridor by about the same 15 point margin he won statewide. Of course, primary strength does not necessarily translate to general election success. Presidential elections usually come down to the economy. Being viewed as more moderate is typically worth no more than a point or two, but in a year when the econometric models predict a tight race, Romney's potential moderate support could make a vital difference.",

Yet, she dislikes Obama so much that <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/2012/03/03/palin-blasts-naive-apology-savages-anybody-obama-november\">she has promised to support</a> the Republican nominee, whoever he may be, in the fall. </p> <p>Polling indicates Palin is not alone. <a href=\"http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/A_Politics/_Today_Stories_Teases/12202_March_NBC_WSJ.pdf\">Have a look at the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll</a>, in which 89% of Republican primary voters said they would vote for Romney. In fact, the percentage who said they would vote for Romney enthusiastically is actually up 7 percentage points since October, albeit that it is still very low at 45%. This compares with only 81% of Republican primary voters saying they would for Rick Santorum, of which only 42% would do so enthusiastically.&#xa0;</p> <p>This 89% Republican support is right around the percentage that George W Bush won in <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/2000vote/general/exitpoll_hub.html\">2000</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html\">2004</a>. Many Republicans are worried that although Romney might win Republicans who turn out to vote, he won't boost Republican turnout as Bush did. </p> <p>Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-presidential-campaign/gop-primary-turnout-down-from-2008-2000-20120308\">turnout has been down</a> in a number of primary states (though <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-last-word/46662534/#46662534\">it was up in Ohio</a>) suggesting enthusiasm among Republicans is also down. That may be because Republicans don't love their choices, but that seems unlikely to affect the fall election. Republicans have maintained <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/153038/gop-slightly-ahead-voting-enthusiasm.aspx\">a lead in the Gallup enthusiasm gap</a> over the Democrats for the 2012 fall elections, despite the \"drawn out\" Republican nomination process.</p> <p>With conservative voters seemingly locked down, the Republican party would likely benefit from a candidate who, comparatively speaking, has the greatest appeal to the middle of the electorate. That seems to be Mitt Romney. In state after state, Romney is doing better among moderates than any other candidate. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/primaries/epolls/oh\">In the state of Ohio</a>, Romney actually lost conservatives by 6 points, but he won the state because he led among moderates and liberals by 14 points. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/primaries/epolls/fl\">In Florida</a>, he only won conservatives by 4 points, but he won moderates by 39 points.&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney's also winning key fall swing counties in the primary. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/primaries/state/oh\">In Ohio, he won Hamilton County</a>, home to Cincinnati, by 20 points. Hamilton was won by Bush by 5 points when he took the state by 2 points in 2004, while Obama took it by 7 points when he emerged victorious in the Buckeye State by 4.6 points in 2008. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/primaries/state/fl\">In Florida, Romney swept the swing I-4 corridor</a> by about the same 15 point margin he won statewide.&#xa0;</p> <p>Of course, primary strength does not necessarily translate to general election success. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/02/who-will-win-white-house-2012\">Presidential elections usually come down</a> to the economy. Being viewed as more moderate is <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2011/11/10/forecasting-2012-how-much-does-ideology-matter/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+themonkeycagefeed+%28The+Monkey+Cage%29\">typically worth no more than a point or two</a>, but in a year when <a href=\"http://blog.american.com/2012/03/yahoo-election-model-predicts-a-narrow-obama-win-gop-takes-senate/\">the econometric models predict a tight race</a>, Romney's potential moderate support could make a vital difference.&#xa0;</p>",

      "bodyText": "A British construction worker and his Italian colleague were murdered by suspected terrorists in north-west Nigeria as UK special forces, supported by the Nigerian army, attempted to rescue them in a bloody operation given the green light by David Cameron. A grave-looking prime minister announced the death of Chris McManus, 28, and the 47-year-old engineer Franco Lamolinara, who were working for an Italian building company, saying he had authorised the operation in the wake of credible information that their lives were in imminent danger. The two men had been held hostage since last May and the rescue had been recommended by UK intelligence following meetings of the government's emergency committee, Cobra. Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister, was informed of the operation in the increasingly lawless north-west of Nigeria only once it had started, apparently because of the need to move quickly. Cameron said it appeared the two men were murdered by their captors before special forces could break through the perimeter buildings in which they had been held. The operation may have taken place in Sokoto, a quiet city that has been a home for members of the Boko Haram sect. A Nigerian official said intelligence leading to the location of the captives came after the Nigerian secret service raided a Boko Haram hideout in the state of Kaduna. That yielded information that the two hostages were being held in Sokoto. The hostage-takers retaliated shortly afterwards by murdering both men, according to the source. Nigerian security agents have been receiving intelligence training from western nations with years of experience in handling terrorism, including the United States and the UK. Military sources say the training would normally start to show results within 18 to 24 months, about the time since foreign countries began technical assistance to tackle Boko Haram. A group known as \"al-Qaida in the land beyond the Sahel\" claimed in December that it had captured McManus. The group released a video showing a blindfolded and bearded man in an orange vest. Three men in dark clothing stood behind him armed with rifles and a machete. A statement on behalf of the Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, commended the \"co-operation and understanding of the British and Italian governments\" and assured that \"the perpetrators of the murderous act, who have all been arrested\", would be made to face \"the full wrath of the law\". The operation was led by the Special Boat Squadron, including some Royal Marines, with as many as 20 UK forces personnel involved. An SBS unit tried to free the men \"after a window of opportunity presented itself\", said an official familiar with the incident. A Whitehall source described the men's captors as among the \"nastiest al-Qaida-affiliated terrorists there are\". Cameron said: \"Our immediate thoughts must be with Chris and Franco's families, and we offer them our sincerest condolences. Both families have endured a terrible ordeal, and this is a devastating moment for all of them.\" He explained: \"After months of not knowing where they were being held, we received credible information about their location. A window of opportunity arose to secure their release. \"We also had reason to believe that their lives were under imminent and growing danger. Preparations were made to mount an operation to attempt to rescue Chris and Franco. Together with the Nigerian government, today I authorised it to go ahead, with UK support.\" He said the early information suggested that the men had been murdered before the rescue operation could be mounted. He had personally conveyed to the family the news of their son's death. \"I also want to pay tribute to all those, including UK personnel, who worked so hard to try to bring Chris home safely. I am very sorry that this ended so tragically,\" Cameron said. \"Terrorism and appalling crimes such as these are a scourge on our world. No one should be in any doubt about our determination to fight and to defeat them.\" Local reports suggested that the military surrounded a house in the city and there had been sounds of gunfire for much of the afternoon. Gunfire continued into the night as the military fought with those in Sokoto. Ambulances ferried the wounded. Security forces erected a cordon blocking journalists from getting within a kilometre of the site. Cameron visited Nigeria last July, months after the hostage capture, and will have discussed the issue with Jonathan. No briefing was given on the hostage position at the time to the journalists accompanying the prime minister, a sign of the extent to which the Foreign Office hoped McManus could be freed without publicity. McManus's family said in a statement: \"We are of course devastated by the news of Chris's death, which we received earlier today. During this ordeal we have relied heavily on the support of our family and friends which has never waned and has enabled us to get through the most difficult of times. \"We are also aware of the many people who were working to try and have Chris returned to our family, and his girlfriend. We would like to thank all of them for their efforts. We knew Chris was in an extremely dangerous situation. However, we knew that everything that could be done was being done. \"Our thoughts are also of course with the loved ones of Chris's colleague, Franco Lamolinara, who are also coming to terms with this truly sad news. \"We now need time to grieve and come to terms with our loss. We would therefore be grateful if you would respect our privacy at this most difficult of times.\" Lamolinara had worked in Africa for many years, but returned to Italy 10 years ago before undertaking a further job with an Italian company, Stabilini Visinoni, based in Nigeria. He was said to have been captured on the last day of his contract. The men had been involved in building the central bank in Birnin Kebbi, capital of Kebbi state. Monti took the phone call from Cameron on a plane trip back to Rome from Belgrade. Monti said: \"An unpredicted acceleration of events took place over the last hours. While fearing an imminent danger for the hostages, Nigerian authorities activated the rescue.\" However some Italian MPs later called for clarification about why the country's authorities were not informed earlier. \"It would seem that, despite the presence of an Italian who had been in the hands of kidnappers for a long time, our country was told only after the blitz,\" said MP Rosa Calipari. She said questions should be asked about why Italian authorities and intelligence officers in Nigeria were not involved in the decision to go ahead with the operation. Meanwhile stunned family and friends in Lamolinara's home town of Gattinara, in the northern region of Piedmont, prepared to declare a day of mourning. \"It was a shock,\" mayor Daniele Baglione told the Italian news agency ANSA. \"We had faith. We didn't expect it. \"Franco was well-known and loved in town,\" Balglione said. \"It is a loss for our community.\" Lamolinara leaves behind a wife and two children, an 18-year-old son and a 16-year-old daughter.",

      "bodyText": "There was a sense of relief and excitement for Stacey Tadd after she sealed an Olympic place by winning Thursday night's 200 metres breaststroke final with a personal best of 2min 26.63sec. The 23-year-old shaved 10 hundredths off her previous time and set an English record on day six of the British Gas Swimming Championships. But for the reigning champion all that mattered was that she did enough to become the 13th British woman to qualify for London 2012. \"It [qualifying for the Olympics] is an amazing feeling,\" said Tadd, who is also a European and Commonwealth finalist. \"I knew I would have to go out hard but I had done the training so I knew I could achieve qualification.\" There was disappointment, however, for Molly Renshaw, who came second in 2:26.81, short of the required qualifying time. The 15-year-old, who won silver at this event last year and is combining a career in the pool with school work, will now return to June's ASA Championships in Sheffield for a final chance to make the Games. Hannah Miley, who has already qualified for the Olympics in the 200m and 400m individual medley, finished third in 2:28.46. The Commonwealth and British champion, James Goddard, has also qualified for this summer's Games after winning silver in the men's 200m individual medley in 1:58.42, with gold medallist Joe Roebuck becoming the first British swimmer to seal a place in three Olympic disciplines, having already qualified for the 200m butterfly and 400m individual medley. Fran Halsall and Amy Smith also secured Olympic qualification in the 100m freestyle after taking gold and silver respectively in last night's final. The victory was Halsall's second of these championships, having already won the 100m butterfly. Earlier in the day, Rebecca Adlington comfortably qualified for Friday's 800m freestyle final. The double Olympic champion won her heat in 8:26.62, more than six seconds ahead of second-placed Grainne Murphy, and the 23-year-old, who is also the British and world record-holder, is now the overwhelming favourite to take a second gold medal, and second Olympic qualifying place, this evening following her victory in Sunday's 400m freestyle final.",

      "body": "<p>There was a sense of relief and excitement for Stacey Tadd after she sealed an Olympic place by winning Thursday night's 200&#xa0;metres breaststroke final with a personal best of 2min 26.63sec.</p> <p>The 23-year-old shaved 10 hundredths off her previous time and set an English record on day six of the British Gas Swimming Championships. But for the reigning champion all that mattered was that she did enough to become the 13th British woman to qualify for London 2012.</p> <p>\"It [qualifying for the Olympics] is an amazing feeling,\" said Tadd, who is also a European and Commonwealth finalist. \"I knew I would have to go out hard but I had done the training so I knew I could achieve qualification.\"</p> <p>There was disappointment, however, for Molly Renshaw, who came second in 2:26.81, short of the required qualifying time. The 15-year-old, who won silver at this event last year and is combining a career in the pool with school work, will now return to June's ASA Championships in Sheffield for a final chance to make the Games. Hannah Miley, who has already qualified for the Olympics in the 200m and 400m individual medley, finished third in 2:28.46.</p> <p>The Commonwealth and British champion, James Goddard, has also qualified for this summer's Games after winning silver in the men's 200m individual medley in 1:58.42, with gold medallist Joe Roebuck becoming the first British swimmer to seal a place in three Olympic disciplines, having already qualified for the 200m butterfly and 400m individual medley.</p> <p>Fran Halsall and Amy Smith also secured Olympic qualification in the 100m freestyle after taking gold and silver respectively in last night's final. The victory was Halsall's second of these championships, having already won the 100m butterfly.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Rebecca Adlington comfortably qualified for Friday's 800m freestyle final. The double Olympic champion won her heat in 8:26.62, more than six seconds ahead of second-placed Grainne Murphy, and the 23-year-old, who is also the British and world record-holder, is now the overwhelming favourite to take a second gold medal, and second Olympic qualifying place, this evening following her victory in Sunday's 400m freestyle final.</p>",

But Hannah Mitchell's story is far richer than that. Her autobiography, The Hard Way Up (1968), published posthumously, offers stark personal testimony of growing up in rural poverty and describes how she was swept up into Manchester's political fervour. As an energetic and persuasive suffragette, Hannah took the \"votes for women\" message right across the Pennines. In November 1906, a byelection was called in Huddersfield: Emmeline Pankhurst and Hannah Mitchell arrived with a flourish, arousing so much interest that they soon had sufficient volunteers to bill-post the town. She said the Huddersfield campaign was \"like putting a match to a ready-built fire\" \u2013 though their opponents, the Liberals, retained the seat. Unlike the following year. In June 1907, another byelection was called \u2013 this time in the Colne Valley constituency running up from Huddersfield into the Pennines. The socialist candidate was dashingly handsome 24-year-old Victor Grayson. Again, Hannah travelled across and, with suffragettes like Adela Pankhurst, \"worked the Colne Valley from end to end\". Grayson's dazzling oratory won the day. He trounced the incumbent Liberals and the suffragettes could not believe their luck. Christabel Pankhurst, talking up this victory, wrote: \"By the defeat of the government at Colne Valley, our movement is brought a stage nearer success \u2026 and victory is certain.\" This was not to be. Hannah Mitchell had many more years' suffrage campaigning against Asquith's intransigent government. However, on the night of their surprise election victory, Emmeline Pankhurst addressed a celebration meeting in George Square, in front of Huddersfield's magnificent station facade that so impressed Ian Jack. Today the foundation has its public launch in Bradford City Hall. Dr Jill Liddington Halifax, West Yorkshire",

Her autobiography, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hard-Way-Up-Autobiography-Suffragette/dp/0860680029\" title=\"\">The Hard Way Up</a> (1968), published posthumously, offers stark personal testimony of growing up in rural poverty and describes how she was swept up into Manchester's political fervour.</p> <p>As an energetic and persuasive suffragette, Hannah took the \"votes for women\" message right across the Pennines. In November 1906, a byelection was called in Huddersfield: Emmeline Pankhurst and Hannah Mitchell arrived with a flourish, arousing so much interest that they soon had sufficient volunteers to bill-post the town. She said the Huddersfield campaign was \"like putting a match to a ready-built fire\" \u2013 though their opponents, the Liberals, retained the seat.</p> <p>Unlike the following year. In June 1907, another byelection was called \u2013 this time in the Colne Valley constituency running up from Huddersfield into the Pennines. The socialist candidate was dashingly handsome 24-year-old Victor Grayson. Again, Hannah travelled across and, with suffragettes like Adela Pankhurst, \"worked the Colne Valley from end to end\". Grayson's dazzling oratory won the day. He trounced the incumbent Liberals and the suffragettes could not believe their luck. Christabel Pankhurst, talking up this victory, wrote: \"By the defeat of the government at Colne Valley, our movement is brought a stage nearer success \u2026 and victory is certain.\"</p> <p>This was not to be. Hannah Mitchell had many more years' suffrage campaigning against Asquith's intransigent government. However, on the night of their surprise election victory, Emmeline Pankhurst addressed a celebration meeting in George Square, in&#xa0;front of Huddersfield's magnificent station facade that so impressed Ian Jack. Today the foundation has its public launch in Bradford City Hall.<br><strong>Dr Jill Liddington</strong><br><em>Halifax, West Yorkshire</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "I've come late to the feast for the post-apocalyptic I Am Alive (Xbox 360/PS3). The download-only title was released on Xbox Live earlier this week to absolutely no fanfare whatsoever. It was a quiet, almost apologetic launch, accompanied by few adverts and met with only a handful of reviews. Those who did review it differed wildly in their assessments. Greg Miller, of the games website IGN, gave it a measly 4.5 out of 10, labelling it \"a flat, frustrating game that isn't worth your time or money\". Yet this paper's own Nick Cowen awarded the title an emphatic five stars. Why such contrasting verdicts? For me, it's a question of genre. Judge it as an action game, shooter or horror and you're bound to find little to get excited about. Each of those genres comes with expectations the game simply doesn't attempt to fulfil. You'll never \u2013 as you might at the climax of an action game \u2013 bring down a helicopter gunship armed only with a rusty foot-pump and a child's bottle rocket, or battle an all-powerful demon in a final struggle for the fate of mankind. What you will do is spend a great deal of time trying to work out how to survive. Because despite the jumping, running and shooting on show in the trailer, I Am Alive is, at base, a puzzle game. Not your traditional puzzler, of course. That's obvious from the scenery alone: there are no precarious wooden towers with green pigs in them, no multicoloured gems to spin or physics-defying portals. Instead, there's a haggard and dusty dad walking the empty streets and scaling the ruptured skyline of the fictional city of Haventon. This is our hero \u2013 unnamed at first, but (major spoiler alert!) later revealed as an Adam \u2013 a rugged everyman who enters the city armed only with a camcorder, a pair of climbing gloves and a heroic head for heights. Adam's here to find his wife and daughter. Caught halfway across America when the mysterious and generic apocalyptic thing happened, he has trekked for a year to make it home to them. Alas, when he arrives at their old house only 15 minutes or so into the game, he finds that they have left for an unknown refugee camp. His wife's note is no help in finding them. All it reveals is that she forgives him: for what, we're left to guess. The rest of the game is Adam's repentance: a redemptive quest to save a lost little girl and her mother. As puzzle game plots go, you'd at least have to admit it beats \"birds get annoyed with pigs\". There are two types of puzzle in the game, climbing and combat, both seamlessly integrated and delightfully intense and cerebral. Climbing is a puzzle because you cannot climb indefinitely. Every leap and shimmy burns stamina: fail to reach the next resting place in time and Adam plummets to his death. Platform game reflexes are required here and there, but by and large scaling the city's ruins is done with the head and not the hands. Skill with a joystick gets you nowhere; smarts, everywhere. Combat is a little less clever, but still much more of a puzzle than a scrap. Many encounters can only be survived in a single way. One false move and our hero gets it. Adam carries a pistol but bullets are in short supply. Only late in the game does he ever have more than one or two. So when four or five thugs advance on you it's a question of identifying the tough guy, downing him, then waving the empty gun menacingly at the others. If you've got it right, they will throw up their hands, drop their weapons and back away. Both those aspects of the game are worth raving about. Each is a fresh and original take on a gaming staple. This is the first post-apocalyptic game that I have played \u2013 and there have been a few \u2013 that has really felt like a struggle for survival. It is also one of very few intelligent puzzle games \u2013 only Portal springs to mind \u2013 to take advantage of the capacity the games have for rich, emotional storytelling. Its chief flaw is that it doesn't dare to be as fiendish a puzzler as it could, dissolving lazily into a more generic action game in the anti-climactic final stages. It may be far from a perfect game but it is the first and therefore the best survival-action-puzzler out there. It may be the end of days, but I'm hoping this is only the beginning.",

      "bodyText": "Aidan Moffat is contemplating whether devolution makes a certain kind of sound. \"There seemed for a long time in Scotland to be an embarrassment in being yourself,\" says the former Arab Strap vocalist. \"When I was young, all Scottish bands seemed to want to be English or American and I found that really peculiar. We're still a fucking miserable bunch, but we certainly seem more proud and comfortable with our own identity than we were in the past.\" Novelist Alasdair Gray's dictum to \"work as if you live in the early days of a better nation\" \u2013 now carved on the wall of the Scottish parliament \u2013 is finding its most obvious application in Scotland's vibrant arts output. Almost 15 years after devolution and with the SNP government gearing up for an independence referendum in 2014, a period of seismic change is finding a parallel expression through music. You won't find many bands north of the border hymning independence or singing about the sanctity of the union \u2013 it's less clear-cut than that. There is, however, evidence of what folk musician and Burns Unit member Karine Polwart calls \"a massive sense of cultural confidence\": acclaimed scenes encompassing everyone from cutting-edge electronic artists to million-selling rock bands; collaborations across genres and art forms; above all, a tangible sense of a nation looking to itself for inspiration and validation. \"Many musicians are embracing their Scottishness,\" says BBC Radio Scotland's Vic Galloway. \"It's not about tartan, bagpipes and shortbread, but a contemporary forward-thinking Scotland that isn't afraid to sing in its own accent and embrace its own culture.\" In the past, Scottish musicians overwhelmingly required the approval of a record industry anchored in the south of England. That has changed, or is at least changing. Selkirk's Frightened Rabbit generate very little heat in the London press but have signed to Atlantic, pop up on Jimmy Fallon's TV show and play nightly to audiences of thousands in the US. They have done it by forging links between their base in Scotland and the rest of the world. Many other bands are embarking on a similar path. Instrumental electro-rock group Errors are typical. Signed to a Scottish label and based in Glasgow, \"15 years ago we probably would have had to make that decision to move south,\" says guitarist Steve Livingstone. \"Now there's more confidence about staying in Scotland. You don't have to have an office in London to communicate with the rest of the industry.\" Musicians may still need to look south for PR and publishing, but \"bands are in many ways side-stepping London,\" says Galloway. \"Nobody will skip it on their tours, that would be petty and counter-productive, but they do their business there then head to New York or Tokyo. They've realised that there are wider opportunities, and that clearly mirrors the political situation.\" Meanwhile, a devolved Scotland has shored up its own institutions. T in the Park is the UK's second-biggest live event and globally renowned, while Celtic Connections is one of the leading lights in the worldwide roots calendar. Organisations such as Scottish Arts Council, Creative Scotland and even the National Theatre of Scotland all play supporting roles. In the bones of the music, too, there are obvious signifiers of a cultural shift. One is a widespread willingness to reclaim traditional music and twist it into new shapes. \"For years folk music was the only form that always used a Scottish voice and language, that was the only place it was acceptable,\" says Moffat. \"We've found a new respect for that and its value has come to light again.\" Two decades ago the Proclaimers were, notes Moffat, \"roundly mocked\" for being virtually the only high-profile Scottish act to sing in their own accent; now it's the norm. Language is always political, and the willingness of singers to embrace their natural voice constitutes a clear statement. \"Hearing Arab Strap sing in their local dialect gave me the confidence to sing in my own accent and write about where I live,\" says the Twilight Sad's singer James Graham, who has become accustomed to American audiences \"singing back at us in a pretend Scottish accent, which sounds like Groundskeeper Willie. We don't wear a Scottish badge, but if people are put off by the accent they're not going to like our music. It actually feels a bit weird when you hear a Scottish band not singing in their own accent.\" Not everyone agrees. Music isn't football or politics, and some musicians worry that overtly transmitting their Scottishness enforces old stereotypes or even leans toward a form of cultural apartheid. For Livingstone, \"the accent still has too many ties that aren't particularly positive. I'm not that comfortable with it. It still seems quite cheesy to me, and some bands who sing in Scottish aren't actually using their natural accents. It's exaggerated.\" Vic Galloway concedes the point. \"There are bands out there \u2013 I could name them but I won't \u2013 who have obviously heard Glasvegas or Arab Strap or Fence Collective and are overdoing their own accent. They sound disingenuous.\" Moffat acknowledges a \"danger that you can end up shutting yourself off\" by being too colloquial, \"but I don't think that's going to happen. As long as we can maintain an international reach there's no harm in looking to our own culture.\" Glasvegas's James Allan believes that the connection between political and cultural change \"is probably quite indirect. Your surroundings always creep in, but it's not to do with a specific political vision for the country.\" He points out that \"issues aren't very different throughout the world \u2013 the things I sing about aren't exclusive to Scotland\". Several musicians emphasise the importance of the internet in breaking borders while making the point that what's happening in Scotland has been happening in other parts of the UK and further afield: more musicians exploring their local culture, more Welsh-language pop and songs with a Mackem or Yorkshire brogue. Polwart reckons the changes in Scotland run deeper, emphasising a mutually supportive network of artists and an upsurge in collaborative projects like Ballad of the Books and Whatever Gets You Through The Night, a new multimedia endeavour featuring specially commissioned words and music by musicians, poets, playwrights and novelists from across Scotland, including David Greig, RM Hubbert, Withered Hand and Errors. \"Communitarianism is a really strong part of our national character,\" she says. \"The links now across genres are incredible and very natural, people are no longer operating in their little pockets. There's a general respect that just wasn't there 20 years ago. It's normal in Scotland and I'm not sure it is normal anywhere else in the UK. It's beautiful and quite special.\" Has devolution driven these changes or has culture dictated the political agenda? It's impossible to tell, but it's likely that the same shift in thinking that made the Scottish parliament a reality and has put independence on the table parallels the way Scotland's arts have evolved. \"I do feel it's all connected and quite exciting,\" says Polwart. \"It's part of a whole debate about whether there is something distinctly different about the Scottish way of doing things. Devolution is a product of that feeling rather than a cause.\" Although she cheerfully talks about holding \"two fingers up at what's going on in the London-centric scene,\" Polwart is adamant that the resurgence in Scotland's national identity is not, by and large, anti-English. \"There's none of that chippiness. It's nothing to do with hatred or defining yourself against something else.\" James Graham agrees that the creative energy is overwhelmingly positive. \"There's a collective feeling that something is happening, and I'm proud to be a part of that.\" It remains to be seen whether independence becomes a reality, and whether it would prove a blessing or a curse for Scotland. Whatever occurs in 2014, a significant process of cultural realignment is already well under way. \"Everyone has big plans,\" says Moffat. \"I'm not sure how I'll vote in the independence referendum, but in the general election Alex Salmond was the only one going: 'We're brilliant.' Everyone else says: 'Times are tough, it's horrible.' He said: 'Fuck all that, we're amazing!' He's a perfect reflection of a new attitude that seems to be catching \u2013 and he's right. We should be proud of our culture, and we don't need the approval of anyone.\"",

As long as we can maintain an international reach there's no harm in looking to our own culture.\"</p> <p>Glasvegas's James Allan believes that the connection between political and cultural change \"is probably quite indirect. Your surroundings always creep in, but it's not to do with a specific political vision for the country.\" He points out that \"issues aren't very different throughout the world \u2013 the things I sing about aren't exclusive to Scotland\". Several musicians emphasise the importance of the internet in breaking borders while making the point that what's happening in Scotland has been happening in other parts of the UK and further afield: more musicians exploring their local culture, more Welsh-language pop and songs with a Mackem or Yorkshire brogue.</p> <p>Polwart reckons the changes in Scotland run deeper, emphasising a mutually supportive network of artists and an upsurge in collaborative projects like Ballad of the Books and Whatever Gets You Through The Night, a new multimedia endeavour featuring specially commissioned words and music by musicians, poets, playwrights and novelists from across Scotland, including David Greig, RM Hubbert, Withered Hand and Errors. \"Communitarianism is a really strong part of our national character,\" she says. \"The links now across genres are incredible and very natural, people are no longer operating in their little pockets. There's a general respect that just wasn't there 20 years ago. It's normal in Scotland and I'm not sure it is normal anywhere else in the UK. It's beautiful and quite special.\"</p> <p>Has devolution driven these changes or has culture dictated the political agenda? It's impossible to tell, but it's likely that the same shift in thinking that made the Scottish parliament a reality and has put independence on the table parallels the way Scotland's arts have evolved. \"I do feel it's all connected and quite exciting,\" says Polwart. \"It's part of a whole debate about whether there is something distinctly different about the Scottish way of doing things. Devolution is a product of that feeling rather than a cause.\"</p> <p>Although she cheerfully talks about holding \"two fingers up at what's going on in the London-centric scene,\" Polwart is adamant that the resurgence in Scotland's national identity is not, by and large, anti-English. \"There's none of that chippiness. It's nothing to do with hatred or defining yourself against something else.\" James Graham agrees that the creative energy is overwhelmingly positive. \"There's a collective feeling that something is happening, and I'm proud to be a part of that.\"</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether independence becomes a reality, and whether it would prove a blessing or a curse for Scotland. Whatever occurs in 2014, a significant process of cultural realignment is already well under way. \"Everyone has big plans,\" says Moffat. \"I'm not sure how I'll vote in the independence referendum, but in the general election Alex Salmond was the only one going: 'We're brilliant.' Everyone else says: 'Times are tough, it's horrible.' He said: 'Fuck all that, we're amazing!' He's a perfect reflection of a new attitude that seems to be catching \u2013 and he's right. We should be proud of our culture, and we don't need the approval of anyone.\"</p>",

The number of female directors on US boards grew only half a percentage point from 2009 to 2011, but at 12.6% it's still higher than the global average, according to a report from the watchdog GovernanceMetrics International (GMI). That compares with an increase of 7.5% in France and 5.4% in Australia. In a survey of 4,300 companies in 45 countries, GMI found that membership of women on corporate boards worldwide had nudged above 10% for the first time. But the rate of growth was meagre, at less than 1% since 2009. \"While any advancement for women is good and something to smile about it's still pathetic that women are half of the population and are now 10% of the boards of directors globally. The US is getting better but it's still pitiful,\" said Erin Matson, acting vice-president of the National Organization for Women. Matson had harsh words for one company in particular. \"It's absolutely ludicrious, for example, that Facebook \u2013 one of the darling companies among people under 30 \u2013 has put forth an all-male board. This is pathetic.\" As the world marks International Women's Day, the trickle of women into boardrooms is being held up as an example of the kind of change that counts. But not every country will be able to replicate the comparatively robust French rate of growth, which stems from a national law passed in 2010 requiring boards to be 20% female by 2013 and 40% female by 2016. Australia achieved significant growth of female board membership without a national law, including a 3.5% increase in female directors in the last year alone. The change is partly driven by a transparency requirement which forces companies to report on their diversity policies and track record, according to GMI. More than 68% of companies on the ASX 200, the Australian national stock index, have at least one female director, compared with 71.1% in the US and 57.9% in the UK. Norway topped the GMI rankings for proportion of female board directors overall at 36.3%. Near the bottom of the rankings was Japan, where women constitute only 1.1% of board directors overall, a proportion that has risen 0.2% since 2009. Growth figures for the UK were not supplied, but the report notes that 10.7% of board members in Britain are women, compared with 16.6% in France and 12.6% in the US.

The move by the Scottish FA came after the independent inquiry it set up into events at Ibrox reported its findings on Thursday. The association's board, meanwhile, has deemed that Craig Whyte, the Rangers chairman and majority shareholder, is not a fit and proper person to serve within Scottish football. Rangers' administrators, Duff and Phelps, hope to convince the Scottish FA's judicial panel at a hearing this month that the club should not be heavily punished for offences committed under an earlier regime. If they fail to do that unlimited sanctions are available. \"In broad terms, we believe there are mitigating factors and we hope to demonstrate the distinction between the club and the actions of any individuals,\" said Paul Clark, Rangers' joint administrator. Stewart Regan, the Scottish FA's chief executive, said: \"The report submitted by Lord Nimmo Smith, having been considered fully by the board, highlights a number of other potential rule breaches by the club and its owner.\" Specifically, Rangers have not submitted audited accounts for the last financial year. The SFA is yet to pass judgment on allegations that Rangers players held second contracts during the club's historical use of employee benefit trusts (EBT) but is questioning whether it should have been made aware of the EBT scheme. Rangers also failed to disclose to the game's governing body at the time of his appointment as chairman that Whyte had served a ban from being a company director between 2000 and 2007. Regan added: \"It is the belief of the board, taking into account the prima facie evidence presented today, that Mr Craig Whyte is not considered to be a fit and proper person to hold a position within association football. We will be writing to Mr Whyte in relation to those findings and shall seek a response within seven days.\" A spokesman for Whyte said: \"Until that [the letter] happens and he has had an opportunity to consider Lord Nimmo Smith's findings, it would be premature to make any comment.\" Rangers have been ordered to pay Dundee United the \u00a361,000 in ticket revenue due from a recent Scottish Cup tie or the SFA will impose further penalties.

A four-day hearing from 30 March will determine whether Rangers are due \u00a33.6m, earlier controlled by Whyte, which was seized last week at the insistence of a court from a lawyer's account.

      "bodyText": "Jacob Acaye, the Ugandan former child abductee at the heart of the film Kony 2012, a web phenomenon seen by more than 50 million people around the world, defended the video and its makers on Thursday against criticism that it is misleading and champions western intervention against an insurgency which is already waning and on the run. Acaye's home region around the town of Gulu is now relatively peaceful, and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which kidnapped him and killed his brother in 2002, has been driven out of northern Uganda along with its warlord leader, Joseph Kony, who has melted into the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. But Acaye denied widespread criticism in Uganda and elsewhere that the American-made film calling for Kony's arrest is out-of-date or irrelevant. \"It is not too late, because all this fighting and suffering is still going on elsewhere,\" Acaye, now 21, told the Guardian in a telephone interview from Kampala, where he is studying law. \"Until now, the war that was going on has been a silent war. People did not really know about it. \"Now what was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. What about the people who are suffering over there? They are going through what we were going through.\" Kony 2012 has become a surprise hit around the world some 25 years after Kony founded his militia and a decade after the peak of its reign of terror in northern Uganda. But its makers, a group called Invisible Children, have been widely criticised by Ugandan journalists and other aid agencies for being self-promoting (the video spends much of its 28 minutes on its maker, Jason Russell and his young son, Gavin) and opaque about its use of funds \u2013 and for concentrating on an issue that has dramatically changed in recent years. \"They are focusing more on an American solution to an African conflict than the holistic approach which should include regional governments and people who are very key to make this a success,\" said Victor Ochen, the director of African Youth Initiative Network based in Lira, the site of one Kony's worst massacres in Uganda. \"They are advocating for a mechanism to end war with more attention to a perpetrator not victims. Campaigning on killing one man and that's the end is not enough \u2026 There are many people who are caught up in this war. Invisible Children has good access to international media but they have no connection with the community they claim to represent.\" Ugandan writer Angelo Opi-Aiya Izama wrote on his blog: \"To call the campaign a misrepresentation is an understatement ... its portrayal of his alleged crimes in northern Uganda are from a bygone era.\" He added that the main problems in the area now are child prostitution, HIV and a mysterious and incurable neurological disorder, known as nodding disease, which has afflicted more than 4,000 children. Izama said that although the LRA is still preying on civilians in neighbouring countries, it was no longer an unknown problem. He said: \"The LRA leader is the subject of an international manhunt by a joint force of Ugandan, Congolese, Sudanese and Central African troops. This effort is assisted by US combat troops.\" In 2009 a US-supported military operation dubbed Operation Lightning Thunder and carried out by Uganda government forces failed to kill Kony. The Ugandan army said Kony had left his compound a few minutes before the attack. Since it was set up in 2003, Invisible Children, a San Diego-based charity has released 11 films and run regular \"awareness-raising\" film tours across the US, mainly showing to schools and universities. The group is barely known in Uganda, but claims to have given school and university scholarships to 750 children, and helped re-build schools. Acaye said that his old school is one of those the group has rebuilt. \"Now that the situation in Gulu is stabilised and there is no longer war there, there is reconstruction of the place. Schools are being built. It is not the fault of the people there that they were abducted and used. They need to be helped,\" he said. \"The organisation has fought really hard to rebuild my school. It is doing good work.\" Acaye was taken prisoner by the LRA militia when it attacked his home village of Koro, near Gulu, but he escaped after three weeks when one unit handed him over to another. \"I got lucky. I was taken by a second group which did not know much about me, and I was transferred to that group. They asked me how long I had been with the LRA and I said three months so they thought I had no intention of running away, so they did not watch me,\" Acaye said. He found his way back to his village, but from then on joined the hundreds of children who walked into Gulu to sleep every night for safety. It was while he was sleeping on a verandah there that he was found by Invisible Children. \"They could not understand what was happening. They wanted a kid who was sleeping there and who spoke English. I could understand English and I could say what was happening, so that is how I was in their film,\" Acaye said. Invisible Children's accounts show it is a cash rich operation, which more than tripled its income to $9m (\u00a35.68m) in 2011, mainly from personal donations. Of this, nearly 25% was spent on travel and film-making. Most of the money raised has been spent in the US. The accounts show $1.7m went on US employee salaries, $850,000 in film production costs, $244,000 in \"professional services\" \u2013 thought to be Washington lobbyists \u2013 and $1.07m in travel expenses. Nearly $400,000 was spent on offices in San Diego. Questions were raised on Thursday about its operation after it emerged that Charity Navigator, a US charity evaluator, gave the organisation only three out of four stars overall, four stars financially, and two stars for \"accountability and transparency\". Noelle Jouglet communication director, responded in a statement saying: \"Our score is currently at 2 stars due to the fact that Invisible Children currently does not have five independent voting members on our board of directors. We are currently in the process of interviewing potential board members, and our goal is to add an additional independent member this year in order to regain our 4-star rating by 2013.\" The three founders of the group, who advocate direct military intervention in response to the LRA, were also criticised for posing with guns alongside members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in 2008. In a statement the group responded : \"We were there to see Joseph Kony come to the table to sign the Final Peace Agreement. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) was surrounding our camp for protection since Sudan was mediating the peace talks. We thought it would be funny to bring back to our friends and family a joke photo. You know, \"Haha \u2013 they have bazookas in their hands but they're actually fighting for peace'.\" The group , which employs around 100 people, is expected to raise millions of dollars from their Kony2012 video but has so far not said how much has been donated or how it will spend the money. Visitors are invited to click a button and buy T shirts, bracelets and posters, ranging from $30-$250. \"People will think you're an advocate of awesome\", runs the sales pitch. The video has broken records for the speed at which a 30-minute film has spread. \"It's an internet phenomenon. It's the mob mentality. Everyone can feel outraged. We are buying into the emotion and handing over money but who it's going to and how it is helping [Uganda's children] is left unanswered\", says Phil Borge, a director of London-based 1000 Heads, a \"word of mouth\" marketing agency. According to figures posted on Vimeo, only four people viewed the video on 3 March , and eight on 4 March, but 58,000 on 5 March, 2.7m on 6 March and 8.2m on 7 March. It had been played over 38m times on YouTube by Thursday evening. Jedediah Jenkins, director of idea development for Invisible Children, called the criticisms \"myopic\" and said the film represented a \"tipping point\" in that it \"got young people to care about an issue on the other side of the planet that doesn't affect them\".",

      "body": "<p>Jacob Acaye, the Ugandan former child abductee at the heart of the film Kony 2012, a web phenomenon seen by more than 50 million people around the world, defended the video and its makers on Thursday against criticism that it is misleading and champions western intervention against an insurgency which is already waning and on the run.</p> <p>Acaye's home region around the town of Gulu is now relatively peaceful, and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which kidnapped him and killed his brother in 2002, has been driven out of northern Uganda along with its warlord leader, Joseph Kony, who has melted into the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. But Acaye denied widespread criticism in Uganda and elsewhere that the American-made film calling for Kony's arrest is out-of-date or irrelevant. \"It is not too late, because all this fighting and suffering is still going on elsewhere,\" Acaye, now 21, told the Guardian in a telephone interview from Kampala, where he is studying law. \"Until now, the war that was going on has been a silent war. People did not really know about it.</p> <p>\"Now what was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. What about the people who are suffering over there? They are going through what we were going through.\"</p> <p>Kony 2012 has become a surprise hit around the world some 25 years after Kony founded his militia and a decade after the peak of its reign of terror in northern Uganda. But its makers, a group called Invisible Children, have been widely criticised by Ugandan journalists and other aid agencies for being self-promoting (the video spends much of its 28 minutes on its maker, Jason Russell and his young son, Gavin) and opaque about its use of funds \u2013 and for concentrating on an issue that has dramatically changed in recent years.</p> <p>\"They are focusing more on an American solution to an African conflict than the holistic approach which should include regional governments and people who are very key to make this a success,\" said Victor Ochen, the director of African Youth Initiative Network based in Lira, the site of one Kony's worst massacres in Uganda.</p> <p>\"They are advocating for a mechanism to end war with more attention to a perpetrator not victims. Campaigning on killing one man and that's the end is not enough \u2026 There are many people who are caught up in this war. Invisible Children has good access to international media but they have no connection with the community they claim to represent.\" Ugandan writer Angelo Opi-Aiya Izama wrote on his blog: \"To call the campaign a misrepresentation is an understatement ... its portrayal of his alleged crimes in northern Uganda are from a bygone era.\" He added that the main problems in the area now are child prostitution, HIV and a mysterious and incurable neurological disorder, known as nodding disease, which has afflicted more than 4,000 children.</p> <p>Izama said that although the LRA is still preying on civilians in neighbouring countries, it was no longer an unknown problem. He said: \"The LRA leader is the subject of an international manhunt by a joint force of Ugandan, Congolese, Sudanese and Central African troops. This effort is assisted by US combat troops.\"</p> <p>In 2009 a US-supported military operation dubbed Operation Lightning Thunder and carried out by Uganda government forces failed to kill Kony. The Ugandan army said Kony had left his compound a few minutes before the attack. Since it was set up in 2003, Invisible Children, a San Diego-based charity has released 11 films and run regular \"awareness-raising\" film tours across the US, mainly showing to schools and universities. The group is barely known in Uganda, but claims to have given school and university scholarships to 750 children, and helped re-build schools. Acaye said that his old school is one of those the group has rebuilt.</p> <p>\"Now that the situation in Gulu is stabilised and there is no longer war there, there is reconstruction of the place. Schools are being built. It is not the fault of the people there that they were abducted and used. They need to be helped,\" he said. \"The organisation has fought really hard to rebuild my school. It is doing good work.\" Acaye was taken prisoner by the LRA militia when it attacked his home village of Koro, near Gulu, but he escaped after three weeks when one unit handed him over to another.</p> <p>\"I got lucky. I was taken by a second group which did not know much about me, and I was transferred to that group.

      "bodyText": "Any hopes the Football Association had that England's players would enjoy a relatively peaceful stay in Krakow during Euro 2012 have been shattered by Polish competition organisers trumpeting it as the main destination for fans to stay. England, Holland and Italy have chosen to base themselves in the picturesque Polish city, partly on the basis that no matches are being played there. But Wojciech Folejewski, the chief operating officer of the Poland 2012 organising committee, said that it would promote Krakow as the country's \"fifth host city\" and stage a fan fest for 30,000 people in a central park. England's base of Hotel Stary was chosen to provide a middle ground between the tabloid frenzy of Baden-Baden in Germany in 2006 and the austerity of Fabio Capello's remote Rustenburg base in South Africa in 2010. After the 2010 tournament there was an acknowledgement from FA executives that the England squad should be \"good tourists\" in Poland and the Ukraine, staying more centrally and engaging with fans and the host country. But Krakow was not expected to be chosen as a hub by the majority of England fans, given that no matches are taking place in the city. However, Folejewski said that a major marketing campaign would try to convince English, Dutch and Italian fans to stay in the city and watch matches on big screens in a huge fan zone. \"Krakow wanted to be a host city very much,\" said Folejewski, speaking at the Havas Global Sports Forum in Barcelona. \"They were very sad the Uefa choice was different. But Krakow has a great chance because the English, Dutch and Italian teams will train there. For sure, many fans and especially journalists will come to Krakow. \"We try to call them the fifth host city. They are preparing a big fan zone ready for something like 30,000 people, with great tourist and cultural programmes. Don't worry about accommodation in Krakow because it's prepared very well, and bars and so on.\" The Polish organisers have developed a website to offer English fans a personalised itinerary for their stay, including accommodation, cultural activities and entertainment \u2013 all within Poland. \"I might have to be diplomatic with my words because of our partners in Ukraine, but I would always say to England fans: do come to Poland,\" he said. Folejewski said it was natural that businesses in Kiev would want to capitalise on the tournament. \"Of course they are enthusiastic because it's great business and it's a great chance to promote. Everybody will decide whether to look at the matches on the screens or go to Ukraine. It's a private decision.\" Folejewski conceded that the logistics of England fans finding accommodation in Ukraine could be an issue, and on Thursday David Taylor, the chief executive of Uefa's events arm, conceded that people were being overcharged by hotels demanding three times their normal rates. There are also concerns about the ease with which English fans staying in Poland will be able to reach Ukraine. They will face journeys of 930 miles to Donetsk, where England play France and the Ukraine, and 540 miles to Kiev, where they take on Sweden. \"There are connections with planes, trains and roads,\" Folejewski said. \"It is not the same high quality as western countries so most of them will use the planes.\" Meanwhile, the England and Tottenham Hotspur centre-half Michael Dawson has been ruled out for the rest of the season, and effectively the European Championship, after suffering ruptured ankle ligaments. Dawson, capped four times, landed awkwardly after leaping with Chris Beardsley in Spurs' FA Cup win over Stevenage on Wednesday night. Harry Redknapp, the Tottenham manager, admitted afterwards that it would be \"a miracle\" if the defender returned before the end of the domestic campaign and his assessment has proved accurate, with scans suggesting the 28-year-old will be out for 10 to 12 weeks.",

      "bodyText": "They grew up on the same sorts of streets in no-nonsense towns across Yorkshire, Cheshire and Lancashire. The six trained together, were dispatched to Afghanistan together and, in the end, perished together when their armoured vehicle was hit by a massive Taliban bomb. On Wednesday, after the blast that destroyed their Warrior vehicle, which took the death toll of British troops in Afghanistan over the 400 mark, talk was dominated by why British soldiers were still in Afghanistan and when they would be pulled out. But yesterday, as the names of the dead men were revealed, the focus was sharply on the lives that had been lost. The first thing that leapt out when the Ministry of Defence released the men's identities was their ages. Private Christopher Kershaw was just 19, while three, Corporal Jake Hartley and Privates Anthony Frampton and Daniel Wade, were only a year older. Private Daniel Wilford was 21 and Sergeant Nigel Coupe was 33. Then came the geography. It turned out that two of the men, Frampton and Wilford, were friends from Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. They were friends, and when times were grim they would swap stories about the people they knew from home, the pubs they went to, the sports fields they had played on. Hartley came from Dewsbury, nine miles down the road, while Kershaw was from Bradford, 15 miles north. Further west, Warrington in Cheshire was mourning the loss of Wade, who was expecting his first child, while Coupe was a married man from Lytham St Annes. He was used to teasing for being a Lancashire man working in a Yorkshire regiment \u2013 but friends said he relished the light-hearted teasing. Much of the focus was on the Wiltshire garrison town of Warminster, where the 3rd Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment is based. Colleagues framed photographs of the six and placed them at the growing shrine of flowers, gifts and written tributes at the gate of Battlesbury barracks. The MoD had said no eulogies would be published until the men were officially identified \u2013 it is understood that their injuries were so severe that this was not an easy process. However, the regiment's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning, praised the men. \"As the commanding officer of a tight-knit family regiment, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my incredibly brave men,\" he said. The officer's voice cracked as he added: \"Six of our brothers have fallen. It has been a sad day, but as their brothers in arms, we remain committed in our duty to continue with our mission. They would want nothing less.\" Stenning said a few words about each of the men. He described the youngest, Kershaw, as a \"true Yorkshire warrior \u2026 a star of the future\". Hartley \u2014 JJ, as he called him \u2013 had risen quickly to the rank of corporal and was a \"future regimental sergeant-major\". Frampton could motivate the whole battalion with his \"cheekiness and smile\". Wilford had \"bags of character\", and he praised Wade for passing his Warrior driving course so quickly. Coupe, a member of the 1st Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, was renowned for his technical prowess. \"He was quite simply the best,\" said Stenning. As the day wore on, more personal details emerged from the towns the men came from and social networking sites. Facebook messages between Frampton and his mother, Margaret Charlesworth, were a reminder of how the parents of all young men sent to Afghanistan must feel. On the day he left for Helmand, Frampton wrote: \"I'll be fine, Mum, trust me. xxxx.\" His mother expressed her concerns for her \"little Afghan hero\", writing: \"Hope my boy stays safe and the rest of the lads out there.\" Mrs Charlesworth was one of the first parents to comment: \"We are devastated at the loss of our beautiful boy Anton and are so very proud of him. He was a legend to us and all who knew him. We are heartbroken,\" she said. Her son had liked the routine and comradeship of the army. \"He was just the joker, the clown. He entertained all the troops. He lifted them up with his daft dances and karaoke and singing. And they loved him for it.\" Wilford, also from Huddersfield, was a \"fun-loving, caring, proud lad\", said his aunt, Susan Clarke. \"He's done us all proud,\" she added. \"He's a hero in our eyes.\" Clarke said Wilford had signed up for the army at the age of 16, but left after about five weeks because \"he hated every minute of it\". However, a year later, he changed his mind. \"He decided when he was coming up to his 18th birthday he'd like to rejoin the army and he wanted to be out there on the front line. And that's what he did.\" The loss of two Huddersfield men prompted the town's MP, Barry Sheerman, to urge a fresh Commons debate on the military campaign. Sheerman said he did not believe Britain should \"cut and run\" from the country but said this week's events should bring the war back on to parliament's agenda. Details from Afghanistan remained sketchy. It is now known that the six were in the second of a routine two-vehicle patrol. The Taliban told the BBC it was responsible for the blast. Some friends of the six called for British troops to be pulled out. But for most it was still too early for such talk. In Dewsbury, Jake Hartley's stepfather, Mark Taylor, said: \"We're devastated at the loss of our son. He's our best friend as well. Jake was always in the limelight. He was a larger than life character. He was really determined to do well in army life. He was kind, generous, heart of gold, an absolutely wicked sense of humour. Asked how the family reacted when Jake was deployed, Taylor said: \"We were all scared of him going, but it was his job, that's what he loved.\" In Bradford, Kershaw's home town, the associate principal of Hanson School, Tom Megahy, said everyone there was \"proud of the young man he became and the service he has given to our country\". Later Kershaw's father, Brian, said he loved the army life, adding: \"That's all he wanted to do from an early age. He never wanted to do anything else. We personally didn't want him to go but that's what he wanted to do. \"He knew there were dangers \u2013 he knew the risks. But I don't think he fully understood until he lost one of his best mates a few months ago. He went a little bit off the rails with that. \"He wasn't 100% sure that he wanted to go, but once he got back down to Warminster around all his friends, he thought it through and he knew he wanted to go there.\" His mother, Monica, told her son she did not want him to be coming back in a wooden box. \"He said: 'I won't mum. I am not that stupid.' What's he done? He's come back in a wooden box. \"It's got everybody. It's not fair. He's too young. He really is. For a young lad like that with so much life ahead of him. He could have done all sorts but for this. It's just all stopped.\" A note was pinned to the door of Coupe's family home in Lytham St Annes asking for privacy. Neighbours, however, were happy to pay tribute to him and recalled the sight of him dressed in his finery heading off for his wedding. Janet Fuller said: \"The last time I saw him was outside his dad's house all dressed up in his uniform, just getting ready to go off to get married.\" Daniel Wade's girlfriend, Emma Hickman, is expecting their child in June. She wept as Wade's uncle, Dave Hamilton, described the family's grief in a statement read outside the family home in Warrington. He said: \"Daniel was 20 years old and like any other normal 20-year-old he was just finding his feet in life, building a future for himself and his fiancee, Emma. Emma adored Dan \u2013 he was her life and will remain so, both in her heart and through the life of their first child, expected in June.\" Balloons were tied to the gate of his family home and flowers left. One message read: \"Six brave soldiers never forgotten.\" Even more poignant was a note from Wade's mother, Lisa Billing: \"Daniel, my baby boy, my hero. I will always love you.\"",

The six trained together, were dispatched to Afghanistan together and, in the end, perished together when their armoured vehicle was hit by a massive Taliban bomb.</p> <p>On Wednesday, after the blast that destroyed their Warrior vehicle, which took the death toll of British troops in Afghanistan over the 400 mark, talk was dominated by why British soldiers were still in Afghanistan and when they would be pulled out. But yesterday, as the names of the dead men were revealed, the focus was sharply on the lives that had been lost.</p> <p>The first thing that leapt out when the Ministry of Defence released the men's identities was their ages. Private Christopher Kershaw was just 19, while three, Corporal Jake Hartley and Privates Anthony Frampton and Daniel Wade, were only a year older. Private Daniel Wilford was 21 and Sergeant Nigel Coupe was 33.</p> <p>Then came the geography. It turned out that two of the men, Frampton and Wilford, were friends from Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. They were friends, and when times were grim they would swap stories about the people they knew from home, the pubs they went to, the sports fields they had played on.</p> <p>Hartley came from Dewsbury, nine miles down the road, while Kershaw was from Bradford, 15 miles north.</p> <p>Further west, Warrington in Cheshire was mourning the loss of Wade, who was expecting his first child, while Coupe was a married man from Lytham St Annes. He was used to teasing for being a Lancashire man working in a Yorkshire regiment \u2013 but friends said he relished the light-hearted teasing.</p> <p>Much of the focus was on the Wiltshire garrison town of Warminster, where the 3rd Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment is based. Colleagues framed photographs of the six and placed them at the growing shrine of flowers, gifts and written tributes at the gate of Battlesbury barracks.</p> <p>The MoD had said no eulogies would be published until the men were officially identified \u2013 it is understood that their injuries were so severe that this was not an easy process.

      "bodyText": "On Thursday Shirley Williams led her erstwhile rebels into the government lobby to vote for hospitals' right to use 49% of beds for private patients. Baroness Jenkin, PR consultant and wife of Bernard Jenkin MP, gloated on Twitter, \"Just walking through the lobby with Shirley Williams.\" Ha ha! Baroness Williams complained of the Twitter storm that greeted her buckling on the NHS bill. What did she expect when she marched her people out to rebel \u2013 and then turned tail? \"Sheep in sheep's clothing,\" said Labour as they watched the Lib Dems troop through the lobby this week, abruptly abandoning close co-operation. Serial displays of sheepdom have led to the bizarre spectacle of Lib Dem peers voting in several cases against amendments they themselves tabled, obediently herded into the opposite lobby by their whips. Two NHS motions compete at the Lib Dem conference in Gateshead this weekend. Shirley's name is on the one calling for support of the bill that she has so eloquently opposed until now. The other motion, from Dr Evan Harris and GP Charles West, seeks to stop it altogether. Shirley's will argue that concessions have effectively removed commercialisation \u2013 see her letter. Harris's view, backed by the medical profession, is that the legal duty on commissioners to promote competition remains red in tooth and claw (detailed in his Political Science blog). Will the party rebel as it did before or will her assurances convince? Only half an hour on Sunday has been set aside for this debate, yet that half hour may set the fate of this party, if it abandons this last chance to stop the bill. Obedience is a necessary political discipline. Politicians must vote for things they hate, as all parties are broad coalitions of interests and opinions. A parliament of maverick independents boasting about their clean consciences would achieve nothing: swallowing bitter pills goes with the territory. Yet they need red lines too. Many Labour MPs look back with regret on sheep-like votes \u2013 on Iraq for some, or on the day early on when some voted in tears to cut single-parent benefits. All have their own regret list: this health bill has been a salutary reminder as the parties opposite mock them with Labour's own 2006 NHS act that laid the foundations for privatising under Blair and Milburn. Shirley Williams and Vince Cable are two of the most likable politicians, warm, humane social democrats, good speakers and empathic listeners \u2013 it's no accident they are known as Shirley and Vince. So it's especially sad and surprising to watch these two humiliate themselves. What for? What is the mission so important that they will vote for extreme Tory policies more shockingly damaging to the weak and powerless than anything Margaret Thatcher tried? Their party grasps at crumbs Cameron and Osborne let fall from the Tory table, while Lib Dems give them respectable cover for things that two years ago they would have thought abominable. Watch the party nod through a trio of terrible bills \u2013 one commercialising the NHS beyond repair, another removing access to the law from the vulnerable, while the welfare bill condemns more children to poverty and evicts families from homes, jobs and schools. Here's what Sarah Teather, the Lib Dem children's minister, once warned about the welfare bill: \"It is vital we understand how many children with disabilities will have their care interrupted, how many will have to move school and how many may lose their homes.\" In the Commons, she stayed away for one vote despite a three-line whip, but after a dressing-down returned to vote for what she knew would damage the children she should defend. Is the pupil premium fair recompense? (I can't ask her, since I get no reply to repeated interview requests.) This week Vince was forced to back down after his leaked letter to George Osborne calling for a British business bank to be carved out of RBS was rudely rebuffed. His creative ideas for German-style investment in cash-starved small business and green industry are close to Labour's. But oddly his letter complained that the government lacked \"compelling vision\". What can he mean? Is he wilfully blind? Their vision is engraved on everything they do, everything Vince keeps voting for. The God-sent economic crisis gifts them the excuse to shrivel the state, shrink welfare, privatise what remains, all done with the cover of Lib Dem support. In harmony Lib Dems chant the chorus \"Deficit-cutting is all that matters\", as they hand instruments to Tory surgeons carving out the state's vital organs. All pain for no gain, no humiliation seems too much, not \u00a39,000 tuition fees, not Ashcroft funding the lost AV referendum, and no doubt Lords reform wrecked too. Their seats in jeopardy, their credibility shot, why are they there? Ed Miliband has been careful to open his arms to them: Lib-Lab coalition (sans Clegg) is a likely next election result, though Labour needs them not to lose too many seats to Tories. Plenty of decent Lib Dems went into this coalition, Vince and Shirley among them, but how will they emerge? Claims of minor mitigation are no excuse for all they have voted for. There is a breaking point between a party and supporters that can never be repaired. When, in a year or so, the NHS is in deep disarray with waiting lists soaring, the party will wish it could boast of having voted down the NHS bill in Gateshead this weekend. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

What did she expect when she marched her people out to rebel \u2013 and then turned tail? \"Sheep in sheep's clothing,\" said Labour as they watched the Lib Dems troop through the lobby this week, abruptly abandoning close co-operation. Serial displays of sheepdom have led to the bizarre spectacle of Lib Dem peers voting in several cases against amendments they themselves tabled, obediently herded into the opposite lobby by their whips.</p> <p>Two NHS motions compete at the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/conference.aspx\" title=\"\">Lib&#xa0;Dem conference in Gateshead</a> this weekend. Shirley's name is on the one calling for support of the bill that she has so eloquently opposed until now. The other motion, from Dr <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/06/nhs-sake-lib-dems-ditch-health-bill\" title=\"\">Evan Harris</a> and GP Charles West, seeks to stop it altogether. Shirley's will argue that concessions have effectively removed commercialisation \u2013 see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/08/lib-dem-debate-health-bill\" title=\"\">her letter</a>. Harris's view, backed by the medical profession, is that the legal duty on commissioners to promote competition remains red in tooth and claw (detailed in his <a href=\"http://bit.ly/wV3UtD\" title=\"\">Political Science blog</a>). Will the party rebel as it did before or will her assurances convince? Only half an hour on Sunday has been set aside for this debate, yet that half hour may set the fate of this party, if it abandons this last chance to stop the bill.</p> <p>Obedience is a necessary political discipline. Politicians must vote for things they hate, as all parties are broad coalitions of interests and opinions. A parliament of maverick independents boasting about their clean consciences would achieve nothing: swallowing bitter pills goes with the territory. Yet they need red lines too. Many Labour MPs look back with regret on sheep-like votes \u2013 on Iraq for some, or on the day early on when some voted in tears to cut single-parent benefits. All have their own regret list: this health bill has been a salutary reminder as the parties opposite mock them with Labour's own 2006 NHS act that laid the foundations for privatising under Blair and Milburn.</p> <p>Shirley Williams and Vince Cable are two of the most likable politicians, warm, humane social democrats, good speakers and empathic listeners \u2013 it's no accident they are known as Shirley and Vince. So it's especially sad and surprising to watch these two humiliate themselves. What for? What is the mission so important that they will vote for extreme Tory policies more shockingly damaging to the weak and powerless than anything Margaret Thatcher tried? Their party grasps at crumbs Cameron and Osborne let fall from the Tory table, while Lib Dems give them respectable cover for things that two years ago they would have thought abominable.</p> <p>Watch the party nod through a trio of terrible bills \u2013 one commercialising the NHS beyond repair, another removing access to the law from the vulnerable, while the welfare bill condemns more children to poverty and evicts families from homes, jobs and schools.</p> <p>Here's what Sarah Teather, the Lib&#xa0;Dem children's minister, once warned about the welfare bill: \"It is vital we understand how many children with disabilities will have their care interrupted, how many will have to move school and how many may lose their homes.\" In the Commons, she stayed away for one vote despite a three-line whip, but after a dressing-down returned to vote for what she knew would damage the children she should defend. Is the pupil premium fair recompense? (I can't ask her, since I get no reply to repeated interview requests.)</p> <p>This week Vince was forced to back down after his leaked letter to George Osborne calling for a British business bank to be carved out of RBS was rudely rebuffed. His creative ideas for German-style investment in cash-starved small business and green industry are close to Labour's. But oddly his letter complained that the government lacked \"compelling vision\". What can he mean? Is he wilfully blind? Their vision is engraved on everything they do, everything Vince keeps voting for. The God-sent economic crisis gifts them the excuse to shrivel the state, shrink welfare, privatise what remains, all done with the cover of Lib Dem support. In harmony Lib Dems chant the chorus \"Deficit-cutting is all that matters\", as they hand instruments to Tory surgeons carving out the state's vital organs.</p> <p>All pain for no gain, no humiliation seems too much, <a href=\"fees\" title=\"\">not \u00a39,000 tuition fees</a>, not Ashcroft funding the lost AV referendum, and no doubt Lords reform wrecked too. Their seats in jeopardy, their credibility shot, why are they there? Ed Miliband has been careful to open his arms to them: Lib-Lab coalition (sans Clegg) is a likely next election result, though Labour needs them not to lose too many seats to Tories.</p> <p>Plenty of decent Lib Dems went into this coalition, Vince and Shirley among them, but how will they emerge? Claims of minor mitigation are no excuse for all they have voted for. There is a breaking point between a party and supporters that can never be repaired. When, in a year or so, the NHS is in deep disarray with waiting lists soaring, the party will wish it could boast of having voted down the NHS bill in Gateshead this weekend.</p> <p><em> \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/commentisfree\" title=\"\"><em>@commentisfree</em></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Halfway through my second day with Stooshe, one of them asks when the Guardian journalist is arriving. I wave at her. \"Oh my God, I thought you were with the label,\" she says. \"Everything was OFF the record,\" shouts another. This is fair enough, if a bit of a shame. On the record, Stooshe are pretty much the model modern pop band \u2013 charismatic and funny, but polite and hard-working, plying their trade at school appearances as well as Radio 1, hitting the promo trail hard in aid of new single Love Me, getting its big chart push this week. But a year ago, before the major label deal, Love Me was called Fuck Me. Pushing the classic girl-group safe-sex message, TLC/Spice Girls-style, Karis, Alex and Courtney swore a lot, had lines including \"Make me come and I'll go\" and gave Courtney the chance to come out to her family by adding \"you know I don't do dick, fuck off\" to the lyrics. In the grand tradition of brash and bolshy pop, it was hard to tell if it was dreadful or brilliant, but their ramshackle charm meant it somehow worked. Obviously Fuck Me was never likely to be a radio smash (though an edit of Azealia Banks's filthy 212 is currently on Radio 1's B-list, so with a little time it could well have been). Love Me, made shiny for airplay, looks as if it will be a top-five hit, now it has had its rude bits removed and features a US-friendly guest rap from former Gym Class Hero Travie McCoy. It puts the trio in a strange position, where the frankness that got them noticed in the first place is now having to be reined in, in order to get them noticed on another level. I ask them if they mind. \"We know that in order to have radio play we do have to clean up our songs,\" shrugs Courtney. \"But there'll always be the dirty version.\" Stooshe were put together a year ago by their \"creative director\" Jo Perry, a former girl-grouper herself who now writes and manages. Alex and Courtney were spotted in Topshop thanks to their arresting looks and asked if they could sing, while Karis, who went to Brit School, had demos on MySpace that got her noticed. By some small miracle of chemistry, they immediately clicked, and spending even a short amount of time in their company makes it obvious that they genuinely like each other. \"We're family,\" Karis explains. \"I know girl bands that don't get on. I've been friends with a couple and I don't know how they did it. How can you gel on stage? How can you do it?\" \"A lot of what we do is banter and it's based on how we are as friends, so for this to work, we need to have ...\" says Courtney. \"Alex, what are you doing?\" \"I'm biting my lip cos I've got a lump on it, sorry.\" Their two notable songs to date, Love/Fuck Me and Betty Woz Gone, both heavily feature the kind of love-it-or-hate-it ad-libbing that's a result of them messing around in the vocal booth, showing off their rapport. In part, that's how Courtney's \"coming out\" line ended up in there (\"That's the beauty of us in the studio. I was joking around, I said it, and it's still on the song\"). Pop stars need a USP, and this is theirs, the sense that no matter how smoothed-out and slick their label tries to make them, it will be impossible to suppress the massive personalities behind that charm. But is that enough to make a go of it today? Alex: \"I wouldn't say there's a criteria to being a pop star. We did it getting spotted in Topshop and Karis singing on MySpace. Marcus Collins did the X Factor route.\" Courtney: \"We're three girls that live by no rules and we're pretty much going to do what we want. Karis and I have tattoos and piercings, we're not your typical girl band. We're not your typical pop stars.\" Alex: \"I don't think there is a typical pop star.\" Karis: \"The cliched pop star is dead.\" Stooshe almost took a more traditional path, when Simon Cowell tried to sign them on the back of Fuck Me last year. His label Syco wouldn't concede complete creative control; they decided he might be a bit too busy with The X Factor to make them his priority, so they went their separate ways. \"We were scared of what could happen,\" says Alex. \"They could have easily changed all our styles and we didn't want that. We want to be ourselves.\" A week earlier I had another glimpse of them being themselves. I spent the evening with them at the NME Awards, where they shone like a bright neon beacon against the neutral colours and black Ray Bans of the indie world, totally, perfectly out of place. \"The girls\", as their manager Sam calls them, were allowed to drink for the first time in three weeks, and they made the most of it, resulting in them harmonising Vybz Kartel songs and assorted dancehall and R&amp;B tracks at the tops of their voices in the post-ceremony cab. At one point Courtney leaned over to Alex and Karis. \"Imagine,\" she sighed, \"if we was bitches and we didn't get on well,\" pulling them into a giant drunk hug. A week later, on the pink promo bus, there is the sober business of work to attend to. \"You got any Fuck Me T-shirts?\" shouts their manager from the front of the van. \"Nah, just Love Me ones,\" they reply.

      "bodyText": "The Manchester City juggernaut stuttered here with a faltering performance that is hardly prime preparation for the tricky weekend trip to Swansea City in the Premier League. Vincent Kompany's loss early on, to a calf injury, will also concern Roberto Mancini, who said of the result: \"It wasn't a surprise because anything can happen in football but I don't think we deserved to lose. Maybe we didn't play well, but football is strange. We have another 90 minutes, we have a big chance to go through, it will be a different game and I think we will score.\" Of Kompany, Mancini added: \"We have to wait one or two days. It is his calf and a calf is a bad position [to have an injury]. I hope for Vinny it will be short \u2013 10 days, maybe two weeks maximum.\" After the back-heeled winner from the Brazilian Xand\u00e3o that came with a touch of Copacabana beach to beat Joe Hart, Mancini's players will be conscious they require a far better performance in the second leg of this Europa League last\u201116 tie at Eastlands next week if they are to progress. Mancini had decided to leave Micah Richards out of the match squad \"so as not to risk him\" before the Swansea game, and to leave Samir Nasri and Mario Balotelli \u2013 who as a replacement hit the bar late on with a header \u2013 on the bench. He also chose to deploy Ga\u00ebl Clichy at right-back, which was a puzzle: the versatile James Milner, who has played there before, may have been a better fit. Against Portugal's fourth-placed club, who are 14 points behind the leaders, City struggled for fluidity throughout. A quiet opening half produced a share of possession and chances with each side rallying at the close: for Sporting, Matias Fern\u00e1ndez's run into the area was blocked as he got his shot off; then a free-kick from Joleon Lescott \u2013 on for Kompany after eight minutes \u2013 was nodded on by Edin Dzeko before Sergio Ag\u00fcero could only head straight at the keeper, Rui Patr\u00edcio. Mancini's men had suffered the first early scare when Hart was forced to leave his area for a headed clearance. As the ball fell to Stijn Schaars an instant attempted lob had the keeper back-pedalling, yet though it was a decent effort the ball was steered wide. As the defence adjusted to Kompany's absence, Sporting again came at City via Jo\u00e3o Pereira, whose shot was saved well low down by Hart. Any smooth pass-and-move from City occurred only sporadically as their front four of Milner, Ag\u00fcero, David Silva and Dzeko struggled to surge at Sporting with convincing force. A Gareth Barry pass took Aleksandar Kolarov down the left-back's corridor. From the corner he won, Milner niftily swapped passes with Silva before aiming in a cross from which Kolo Tour\u00e9 drew a sharp save from Patr\u00edcio with a header. There were further warnings that the visitors would concede if concentration wandered. After Diego Capel moved the ball from left to right to find Marat Izmailov, who blazed wide, moments later Nigel de Jong missed a tackle deep inside the Sporting half. Fern\u00e1ndez raced forward as City reversed towards their own penalty area but when the midfielder spread the ball wide to the right he failed to take the return pass and the danger faded. Too often disjointed, City's best chance of scoring appeared to be from a set piece, which illustrates the quality deficit they displayed. Another Milner-Silva-Milner move from a corner created space for the Englishman to shoot, but when his miskicked effort took the ball to Barry the midfielder could not finish from in front of goal. After 33 minutes Sporting had come close to taking the lead by the kind of fluke required to light up a so far tepid contest: a deflection from a delivery by Emiliano Ins\u00faa, once of Liverpool, spun dangerously close to Hart's goal and the keeper had to move smartly to tip away the ball from beneath his bar. There was no fortune about Sporting's goal six minutes after the break. From a free-kick conceded by Kolo Tour\u00e9 the delivery was pinged in on the diagonal where Hart, diving to his left, pushed the ball out. It arrived at the feet of Xand\u00e3o, whose initial shot was saved well by the keeper, but the Brazilian applied a touch off the back of his boot for the defender to record his first goal for Sporting. As the decibel level from the roar inside the stadium rocketed City nearly allowed the home side's lead to double. Jo\u00e3o Pereira swung over a cross from the right and as Hart came to claim the ball Lescott \u2013 who picked up a groin problem \u2013 stuck out a leg: the ball might have gone anywhere but, fortunately for City, a corner, not an own goal, was conceded. Unlike their Premier League cousins Arsenal in the Champions League after their 4-0 hammering in Milan, City are still very much in their European competition ahead of the return game. But they will have to improve.",

As the ball fell to Stijn Schaars an instant attempted lob had the keeper back-pedalling, yet though it was a decent effort the ball was steered wide.</p> <p>As the defence adjusted to Kompany's absence, Sporting again came at City via Jo\u00e3o Pereira, whose shot was saved well low down by Hart. Any smooth pass-and-move from City occurred only sporadically as their front four of Milner, Ag\u00fcero, David Silva and Dzeko struggled to surge at Sporting with convincing force. A Gareth Barry pass took Aleksandar Kolarov down the left-back's corridor. From the corner he won, Milner niftily swapped passes with Silva before aiming in a cross from which Kolo Tour\u00e9 drew a sharp save from Patr\u00edcio with a header.</p> <p>There were further warnings that the visitors would concede if concentration wandered. After Diego Capel moved the ball from left to right to find Marat Izmailov, who blazed wide, moments later Nigel de Jong missed a tackle deep inside the Sporting half. Fern\u00e1ndez raced forward as&#xa0;City reversed towards their own penalty area but when the midfielder spread the ball wide to the right he failed to take the return pass and the danger&#xa0;faded.</p> <p>Too often disjointed, City's best chance of scoring appeared to be from a set piece, which illustrates the quality deficit they displayed. Another Milner-Silva-Milner move from a corner created space for the Englishman to shoot, but when his miskicked effort took the ball to Barry the&#xa0;midfielder could not finish from in front of goal.</p> <p>After 33 minutes Sporting had come close to taking the lead by the kind of fluke required to light up a so far tepid contest: a deflection from a delivery by Emiliano Ins\u00faa, once of Liverpool, spun dangerously close to Hart's goal and the keeper had to move smartly to tip away the ball from beneath his bar.</p> <p>There was no fortune about Sporting's goal six minutes after the break. From a free-kick conceded by Kolo Tour\u00e9 the delivery was pinged in on the diagonal where Hart, diving to his left, pushed the ball out. It arrived at the feet of Xand\u00e3o, whose initial shot was saved well by the keeper, but the Brazilian applied a touch off the back of his boot for the defender to record his first goal for Sporting.</p> <p>As the decibel level from the roar inside the stadium rocketed City nearly allowed the home side's lead to double. Jo\u00e3o Pereira swung over a cross from the right and as Hart came to claim the ball Lescott \u2013 who picked up a groin problem \u2013 stuck out a leg: the ball might have gone anywhere but, fortunately for City, a corner, not an own goal, was conceded.</p> <p>Unlike their Premier League cousins Arsenal in the Champions League after their 4-0 hammering in Milan, City are still very much in their European competition ahead of the return game. But they will have to improve.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you visit any anti-choice website or facility, within moments of your arrival, you'll be hit with the assertion that abortion causes mental health problems for women who get them. The problem with this, besides the whiff of bullying, is there isn't any evidence for the claim. Repeated studies, which have been blessed by the American Psychological Association, have shown there is no causal link between abortion and mental illness. Despite the disinterested assessment of the experts, though, anti-choicers have continued to push this claim. Now, however, the last bit of supposedly scientific evidence establishing the link between abortion and mental illness has been debunked \u2013 mostly because the original researchers distorted their data in order to establish a causal link where none existed. Priscilla Coleman, a professor at Bowling Green State University, published a paper in the Journal of Psychiatric Research in 2009 claiming to demonstrate a causal link between abortion and mental illness. This month, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco and the Guttmacher Institute debunked Coleman's heavily criticised study, showing decisively that the data collected by Coleman did not support her conclusion that abortion causes mental illness. The Journal ran a letter from the debunking team (pdf), and devastatingly for the anti-choice cause, Ronald Kessler, the principal investigator of the National Comorbidity Survey, and Alan Schatzberg, editor-in-chief of the Journal, agreed with the debunkers (pdf). Turns out that Coleman juiced up her results by counting mental health disorders that occurred prior to women's abortions. It's a little like arguing that the stomach-ache I had a week ago is caused by the meal I ate tonight. While fully acknowledging that errors are a common problem in research attempting to establish causal links between any two events, it does seem that, at a bare minimum, researchers should realize that an event such as an abortion cannot actually cause events that happened before it. Coleman's response acknowledged that they used lifetime mental health diagnoses (rather than 12-month or 30-day diagnoses, as previously stated) because she and her colleagues had wanted to \"capture as many cases of mental health problems as possible\". Why is it so important to anti-abortion activists to claim, despite all evidence to the contrary, that abortion causes mental illness? The answer goes back to the fundamental disagreement between pro- and anti-choicers on what men back in the day called \"the Woman Question\": that is, \"What are women for?\" Sadly, as recently as 2012, conservative commentator James Poulos insisted on framing the question of women's rights in just this way, saying if we could just get to the mystery of what women are \"for\", then we'll know how many rights they should be allowed to have. For pro-choicers, the answer to this question is obvious: women aren't \"for\" anything, and the question itself dehumanizes women, positioning them as objects to be used instead of people in their own right. Like men, we're not the means to the end, but the end. Thus, we conclude, women have a right to self-determination. For anti-choicers, the answer to the question of what women are \"for\" is rooted in the same old restrictive gender roles: women are for making babies, with some add-on features such as stove operation, male sexual release, and toilet cleaning. If a woman rejects baby-making, she's ceased working as she was meant to, and is therefore broken. It's like a car whose windows roll up and down and the stereo works, but the engine just won't start. They need a way to describe their sense that a woman rejecting childbirth is broken, and the language of mental illness gives them an easy way to do this. There's a long and dishonorable history of labeling women mentally ill for refusing to perform restrictive gender roles to sexist standards. Sigmund Freud dismissed rebellious women as fantasists. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's famous essay \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" was rooted a culture where women with yearnings for work outside of the home were labeled sick and confined to bed rest. Even as late as the 1960s, the urge to self-determination in women was often treated with sedatives, in hopes they could be content with a life of being \"for\" someone else, instead of for themselves. The psychological community's rejection of anti-choice claims that self-possession is a sign of mental illness in women is a testament to the ability of science to adjust to evidence and criticism, and to right itself after even decades of doing wrong. Unfortunately, the anti-choice community does not have the same regard as the majority psychological community for facts and evidence. Despite this latest debunking of claims that abortion causes mental illness, I fully expect anti-choice activists to continue to insist the link is there. They never really had concerns about real-world diagnoses of mental illness, anyway; it was just a metaphor to describe their conviction women who have abortions are broken women. As long as they continue to believe that any woman who says she doesn't want a baby at any point in time is malfunctioning, we can expect them to continue to push the false link between mental illness and abortion. But it's important not to let anti-choice malfeasance distract too much from the facts. Abortion doesn't make women sick, in the head or in the body. For many women, it feels like a relief, because control of your body and life is returned to you. While getting an abortion is never fun, it's a legitimate failsafe for women who find themselves pregnant when they don't want to be. Most importantly, women aren't \"for\" anything, whether it's serving men or making babies. And women who live, like men, for themselves, cannot be considered broken.",

      "bodyText": "Rebekah Brooks's solicitor, Stephen Parkinson, argues that his client cannot expect to get a fair trial because too much \"prejudicial material has come into the public domain.\" In a Daily Telegraph article, he complains that witnesses giving evidence at the Leveson inquiry have made accusations against Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, without any challenge. He writes: \"Paul McMullan was allowed by the Leveson inquiry to accuse my client, Rebekah Brooks, of being the 'criminal-in-chief'. This was received uncritically. Mrs Brooks had been denied permission to be a core participant in the inquiry, so no one was there on her behalf to challenge the evidence. There was no cross-examination of Mr McMullan, his credibility or his motives. This is just one example of what has become a pattern. Last Monday, Sue Akers, the deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, responded to an invitation to 'provide a statement about the investigation into police corruption providing as much detail as possible, without naming individuals, as is compatible with the ongoing police investigation'. DAC Akers took full advantage of that opportunity, alleging that there had been a culture at The Sun of illegal payments to a network of public officials. She said that systems had been created to facilitate such payments, which were authorised 'at a very senior level'. She might not have mentioned names, but it did not take much to fill in the gaps. Nor was she alone. Brian Paddick and Jacqui Hames, both former police officers, went on to make their own allegations, going further than DAC Akers and naming names. Understandably, the press reported this extensively. Instantly, stories appeared about various individuals who had been arrested as part of the inquiry. The publicity was huge, dramatic and sensational.\" Parkinson, head of criminal litigation at the London law firm, Kingsley Napley, points out that the attorney general is now considering whether this reporting amounts to contempt of court. He adds: \"Quite separately, the judge will be bound to consider \u2013 if there is ever a prosecution \u2013 whether a fair trial is possible. Those of us representing the current and former journalists, particularly at The Sun, who bore the brunt of the prejudicial comments, will inevitably make the point that publicity of this kind does not fade from the memory.\" He does not blame Lord Justice Leveson and his inquiry, indicating instead that it is \"a structural weakness that goes back to the basis on which it was set up by David Cameron.\" But, he concludes, there is now \"a deep sense of unease\" because \"a number of individuals\" have had their reputations traduced. \"Few people know the impact of such publicity on their lives, and the depth of stress and worry they have had to bear. \"But each of us knows enough to question whether the public interest and the legal premise of \"innocent until proven guilty\" have been served by what we have seen and heard.\" Source: Daily Telegraph",

Last Monday, Sue Akers, the deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, responded to an invitation to 'provide a statement about the investigation into police corruption providing as much detail as possible, without naming individuals, as is compatible with the ongoing police investigation'.</p> <p>DAC Akers took full advantage of that opportunity, alleging that there had been a culture at The Sun of illegal payments to a network of public officials. </p> <p>She said that systems had been created to facilitate such payments, which were authorised 'at a very senior level'. She might not have mentioned names, but it did not take much to fill in the gaps. Nor was she alone. </p> <p>Brian Paddick and Jacqui Hames, both former police officers, went on to make their own allegations, going further than DAC Akers and naming names. </p> <p>Understandably, the press reported this extensively. Instantly, stories appeared about various individuals who had been arrested as part of the inquiry. The publicity was huge, dramatic and sensational.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Parkinson, head of criminal litigation at the London law firm, Kingsley Napley, points out that the attorney general is now considering whether this reporting amounts to contempt of court. He adds:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Quite separately, the judge will be bound to consider \u2013 if there is ever a prosecution \u2013 whether a fair trial is possible. </p> <p>Those of us representing the current and former journalists, particularly at The Sun, who bore the brunt of the prejudicial comments, will inevitably make the point that publicity of this kind does not fade from the memory.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He does not blame Lord Justice Leveson and his inquiry, indicating instead that it is \"a structural weakness that goes back to the basis on which it was set up by David Cameron.\"</p> <p>But, he concludes, there is now \"a deep sense of unease\" because \"a number of individuals\" have had their reputations traduced. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Few people know the impact of such publicity on their lives, and the depth of stress and worry they have had to bear. </p> <p>\"But each of us knows enough to question whether the public interest and the legal premise of \"innocent until proven guilty\" have been served by what we have seen and heard.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/9131338/Phone-hacking-can-these-journalists-really-get-a-fair-trial.html\">Daily Telegraph</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "\"Only six minutes to go,\" barked a man in a blue geometric print T-shirt, braces, ankle-skimming trousers and bowtie, to the crowd who had been queuing on Regent Street in London since the early hours of the morning on Thursday. The latest designer fashion collaboration, served up by Swedish high street retailer H&amp;M, typically created a bit of a fashion scene as it went on sale. The latest collaborator to re-interpret its brand's DNA at high-street friendly prices is Italian label Marni \u2013 famed for left of centre shapes, quirky accessories and strong use of clashing colour and print. The enthusiasts at the head of the queue were soon eagerly loading up with armfuls of clothes, moving quickly to make the most of their allocated 10 minutes in the roped-off shopping pen. After eight years of designer ranges, H&amp;M now operates like a well-oiled machine. Gone are the days of a crowd of frenzied shoppers being unleashed upon the entire store and ransacking the shelves. Instead H&amp;M has turned fashion collaboration as a retail concept into a series of high-profile shopping events. There have been celebrity blockbusters, such as David Beckham's underwear range, which went on sale last month, and fashion blockbusters \u2013 such as Versace, which caused a furore last year when Donatella Versace met fans on a pink carpet at Regent Street. Marni, meanwhile, ticks the box marked: niche-fashion-label-with-insider-clout. This is a formula that guarantees hype and interest across the fashion board. Kaz Yau, 30, started queuing at 6.30am and has been going to the H&amp;M collaboration openings since the Stella McCartney hook-up in 2005. She said they have become events in themselves now, and the queueing starts earlier. A trio of Italians who live in London \u2013 Valeria Vernizzi, 28, Angelica Curci, 25 and Isabella Palumbo, 27 \u2013 had been waiting since 2am. They passed the time watching films on a laptop. They said they had been drawn by the combination of Sofia Coppola, who directed the Marni H&amp;M TV commercial and has been photographed wearing clothes from the range, and by Marni's use of pattern and colour. Maj Abualjadayel, 35, head-to-toe in mainline Marni, including a yellow print handbag, has been a fan of the label for years. \"I love their fits, their quirkiness and their unique point of view,\" he said. On his shopping list were tops, accessories and some of the jewellery. Not everyone had a totally happy H&amp;M Marni experience though. A laden-down customer, one of the first batch of 20 shoppers who had had their 10 minutes, was stopped at the exit and told she could only buy one of each item. Looking tearful, she duly put some purchases back. A spokesman for H&amp;M, however, was quick to point out that this is a 70 piece collection, so there is plenty to choose from, and it would not be fair to other customers if no limit was imposed. This is also clearly a strategy to reduce the number of shoppers buying items to sell online at inflated prices. Consuelo Castiglioni, Marni's creative director and founder, based the H&amp;M collection on the brand's archive. \"I wanted to create a true Marni wardrobe by revisiting all our favourite pieces in signature fabrics and prints,\" she said. Items initially selling well were the large circular printed skirts and jackets, the signature plastic jewellery, wooden-heeled sandals and a printed pyjama set. This collection is selling online and at 250 stores worldwide. H&amp;M has also previously collaborated with Karl Lagerfeld, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Jimmy Choo, Lanvin and Matthew Williamson.",

      "bodyText": "What is a solar storm? Our Sun is a furious mass of gases that emits radiation of all kinds, from the stuff that plants can convert to sugar through photosynthesis to high-energy particles and rays that would tear apart anything they came across on Earth. On occasion, magnetic storms on the surface of the star can end up causing flares, an explosion on the Sun's surface that can release as much, in one go, as a sixth of the entire Sun's output per second. If the storms are particularly strong, they will erupt into coronal mass ejections (CMEs), huge clouds of plasma that travel at millions of miles per hour, consisting of energetic electrons and protons with smaller amounts of helium, oxygen and iron. What happens during a solar storm? A solar flare would be accompanied by a burst of electromagnetic radiation (including radio and visible waves, in addition to more dangerous gamma, ultraviolet and X rays) that, when it hits Earth, would ionise the outer atmosphere. On the ground, people would be safe but GPS satellites and other such equipment would be affected. About 10-20 minutes after the initial flare would come a burst of energetic protons. A further 10-30 hours later, a CME would hit the Earth's magnetosphere and cause electric currents to surge along oil pipelines and high-tension electricity lines. This might cause blackouts but, around large parts of the world, people would see a lightshow in the sky similar to the aurora borealis. How often could this happen? Solar storms can happen at any time but tend to become more severe and more frequent in roughly 11-year cycles. The peak of the current cycle is expected in 2013. Since the last peak in activity, the world's reliance on electronic technology \u2014 and therefore vulnerability to space weather \u2014 has increased substantially. Does the Earth have protection? The Earth's magnetic shield, called the magnetosphere, can usually take the worst of the Sun's radiation, preventing it reaching the delicate molecules of life on the Earth's surface. Normally, all we see of this high-energy radiation are the shimmering Northern Lights, the aurora borealis, and its southern equivalent, the aurora australis. Why is this a problem today? Our advanced, interconnected world depends on fast electronic connections between people in different countries, powered by the electricity grid. \"Space weather can affect human safety and economies anywhere on our vast wired planet, and blasts of electrically-charged gas travelling from the Sun at up to five million miles an hour can strike with little warning,\" warned John Holdren and John Beddington, respectively the chief scientific advisers to Barack Obama and UK government in a joint statement in 2011. \"Their impact could be big \u2014 on the order of $2tn during the first year in the United States alone, with a recovery period of 4 to 10 years.\" In an address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC, Holdren and Beddington outlined major solar storm events from the past. \"In 1921, space weather wiped out communications and generated fires in the northeastern United States. In March 1989, a geomagnetic storm caused Canada's Hydro-Quebec power grid to collapse within 90 seconds, leaving millions of people in darkness for up to nine hours. In 2003, two intense storms travelled from the Sun to Earth in just 19 hours, causing a blackout in Sweden and affecting satellites, broadcast communications, airlines and navigation.\" A study by the Metatech Corporation in 2008 showed that a repeat of the 1921 solar storm today would affect more than 130 million people with sudden and lasting ramifications across the US, accoding to Holdren and Beddington. They added that a recent report by insurance market Lloyd's of London stated that \"a loss of power could lead to a cascade of operational failures that could leave society and the global economy severely disabled.\" Holdren and Beddington said power companies could prepare by hardening transformers at substations and installing capacitors to soak up current surges that would be caused by severe storms. Critical satellites should be shielded. \"Some of these measures can bear fruit quickly, while others will pay off over the longer-term,\" they said. \"What is key now is to identify, test, and begin to deploy the best protective measures, in parallel with reaching out to the public with information explaining the risks and the remedies.\"",

Literally 30 minutes after this picture was taken, he and Nancy were tearing each other's black tie off atop a bed of Ferrero Rocher in an attache's office, only to be disturbed by the British ambassador, who Nancy forces to watch while purring: \"Geeve me a glowing write-up for Weekeeleaks, darlink.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Earlier this week, Bret Easton Ellis announced his intention to cast a male porn star as the lead in The Canyons, a new film noir to be directed by Paul Schrader, the screenwriter of Taxi Driver and director of American Gigolo. Ellis had long been an admirer of James Deen, who is striking because of his unusual appeal to young women \u2013 not generally key consumers of porn. When the two men met in January, they bonded over being unlikely poster boys: \"He ordered a salad and we chatted amiably about the unearned feminist hysteria we both received at certain points in our careers,\" Ellis tweeted. Deen, 26, was recently featured on ABC's Nightline in a segment asking if the nation knows that its daughters increasingly view him as a consort in their romantic fantasies. That Nightline saw fit to give him air time \u2013 the show is a rough equivalent of Newsnight \u2013 was further evidence either that the mainstream is more ready to accept adult entertainment performers on its turf, or that adult entertainment is itself becoming more mainstream. \"He's exactly the guy I was thinking of,\" says Ellis. \"He's accessible and represents the democratisation of our culture. He's not some hot-blooded, super-tanned caveman pumping it \u2014 he's a cute boy you could have gone to college with.\" Over the Hollywood hills in the San Fernando Valley, home of the US porn industry, Deen considers the role that could carry him toward bonafide film stardom. And he is not wholly convinced. Porn is regular work, often seven days a week, and the money is good, even if the fees \u2013 as with all filmed entertainment \u2013 have taken a hit since the collapse of the DVD market in 2008. He has two sports cars in his garage \u2013 a Nissan and a BMW \u2013 and mortgage payments to make on the house, which is virtually bare of furniture. Most in Hollywood say the road from porn to acting is impassable; it is still the way out of an acting career, not into one. But one of Deen's occasional co-stars, Sasha Grey, appeared in Steven Soderbergh's The Girlfriend Experience and HBO's Entourage. The fashion industry has adopted her, casting her in shoots with Glen Luchford and Steven Klein, and the New York Times critic AO Scott praised her for an \"unusual degree of intellectual seriousness\". But it's not clear that even Grey, with her male fanbase, can keep this momentum going. Deen fears she has become the \"porn girl who did a couple of mainstream things\" \u2013 which is more or less where predecessors such as Traci Lords, who acted in a remake of Roger Corman's film Not of This Earth followed by John Waters' Cry-Baby, Ron Jeremy and La Cicciolina got to. However, the latter was elected as a representative in the Italian parliament and did offer to sleep with Saddam Hussein in an attempt to avert the first Gulf War. Perhaps Deen (he refuses to give his real name but offers that he is a Jewish boy from Pasadena) is representative of a new entertainment phenomenon. The recent Oscars broadcast sounded like a death rattle for the traditional film business. Meanwhile, on TV and the internet, chances are being taken and sexual barriers appear to be coming down. Take for instance the HBO dramas (Hung and a forthcoming pilot by James Frey about the porn industry), Steve McQueen's Shame and two Linda Lovelace biopics now under way. But a porn star in the Hollywood mainstream? \"It's eminently possible,\" says Derek Hay, a British agent at the agency LA Direct Models. \"A lot of the old taboos have fallen away. Look at Paris Hilton. Or Kim Kardashian. She was D-list before the release of her sex tape.\" However, another talent agent counters simply: \"No way. I don't think anyone has crossed over successfully though a bunch of the females have tried.\" Hay thinks The Canyons' producers are wise to take advantage of Deen's female fan base. He is the first porn star to also embody the traditional clean-cut qualities of the romantic leading man \u2013 the Tom Cruise of porn. Fans point to a certain courtliness and sophistication in his manners. He looks his partners in the eye, holds their hands, offers direction. On the street he is recognised but not mobbed; last year when he came to Britain an immigration official knew exactly who he was. Ellis thinks that Deen's popularity is an example of a generational gap. Oldsters, Ellis says, \"don't understand how available pornography is\". Deen is definitely committed to the cause. He is in a career that he planned to pursue from a young age. \"I've always been hypersexual.\" Nor does he plan to retire \u2013 some performers keep working into their 50s; some are finished at 30. \"I'd like to perform for as long as humanly possible.\" He not only performs but produces and directs \u2013 sometimes directing himself \u2013 and he mostly banks his earnings. \"I'm a regular guy,\" he says on the balcony of his hillside house. \"I don't go to parties, get drunk and take cocaine. I'm just kinda \u2026 normal-ish.\" Perhaps he could channel his popularity into picking up corporate sponsorship? \"How would they do it? Do I wear a tattoo on my butt? A T-shirt in the beginning of a scene? How do you sponsor a naked person? I'm sure Coca-Cola knows how to sell its drinks. It doesn't have to take a risk with me.\" Irrespective of the Ellis/Schrader project, Deen is wary of being accused of courting his young fanbase. The Nightline story, he believes, was deliberately skewed by officials at ABC's parent Disney to portray him as a threat. \"I'm not preying on America's youth and I'm not trying to captivate that audience so I don't feel I should be held responsible,\" he protests. \"I just have a few specific things that are a draw for an underage teenage audience.\" But he is not above speaking his mind. Earlier this week the city of Los Angeles passed an ordinance banning pornographic filmmaking without condoms. Deen thinks lawmakers are misreading porn's purpose: to entertain, not educate. One place where the legislation apparently does not apply is in the 90210 postcode. \"The industry will move to Beverly Hills,\" he predicts. The recent publicity appears to have muted his enthusiasm for the mainstream as much as excited it, and to have ignited an eagerness to defend the industry in which he found his niche. Indeed, Deen's scepticism would equal that of the sternest critic. \"People may say: 'Oh, he's dynamic and he's got charisma and he translates on to the screen.' But that's different to saying: 'Let's put him in mainstream movies, and give him a Gucci campaign so we can sell more product, because sex sells, and people dig controversy.' \"I don't want to be 'that porn guy' because I'm doing what I always wanted to do,\" Deen considers. \"The only reason I'm hoping to do this film is because it's with Bret Easton Ellis and it's something I can really get behind. If it was Steven Spielberg I wouldn't do it. I'd say: 'How much are you going to pay me because I have to work harder to do a good job. And I don't get to have sex.'\"",

Then I became a slave to the virtual video shop, establishing myself as an early adopter of LoveFilm, poring over my choices online, snatching the red DVD parcels off the doormat, fretting over the inevitable loss of a disc. Then along came Kitty. Then about six weeks after her birth the realisation by my husband that it was possible to purchase films off the telly. Just like that. Point, enter pin, click and off you go. I mourned going to the cinema, post-child. I had never understood why parents bleated on about why they were never able to go but it became clear: early showings clash with babies' bedtimes and later showings are just too damned late for sleepy parents. But on-demand film has changed the way I watch films and, I think, for the better. There is so little effort, so little commitment. If you had walked to the video shop, or got in the car, stood in front of the grubby racks of boxes bickering about what to get, taken it up to the desk, bluffed your way through not having your membership card and then scuttled home clutching your plastic box, you were more likely to place a higher value on your haul. When you just have to squint at the \"Hot from the Cinema\" list, poke about on the iPad to see what Peter Bradshaw thought, then key in your pin (1234, in case you're ever burgling my house and want Shrek on in the background), the film comes with fewer expectations. This lack of expectation is a good thing. Seeing a great film (The Artist, The Descendants, Drive) in the cinema, with your head beating to an insistent thrum of publicity, can only lead to disappointment. \"Didn't think much of it,\" you will shriek or tweet. Yes, of course you didn't think much of it. It was only a film, it's not the messiah. But \u2013 see that same film six months later, without so much as having to go down the road and fetch it with your own baby-soft hands, having totally forgotten that he died while it was being made, or they got together during it, or that the joke is that that bloke turns out to be French, and you can only judge the thing on its own terms. So, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is unfathomable, unwatchable; Drive is weird and violent even by my psychotic standards; One Day is the worst film ever made; Midnight In Paris, thought my husband, who loves Woody Allen, is the old man's best work. And you see films you enjoy, which you would turn your nose up at in the cinema or in the video shop. Friends With Benefits was charming \u2013 laugh at me! I don't care! (yes I do) \u2013 and Contagion, which I would never usually have bothered with, was absolutely terrific! And so short! The downside is that films have to work so much harder right from the beginning to keep you. With your finger hovering over the \"Stop\" square of death on your remote, you are the Simon Cowell of in-home dial-up entertainment. One wrong move and you're back in the real world watching a double bill of Come Dine With Me before you know it. I know a film is going to die when about 10 minutes in, sometimes five, my husband will clasp his hands behind his head and say: \"Are we actually going to sit here and watch this?\" This always makes me sad. Would I have continued to watch Trading Places on the strength of the first 10 minutes? What about Gone with the Wind? Or Shawshank Redemption? It would have been a terrible shame to miss any of those films due to an itchy trigger finger. I no longer mourn the cinema \u2013 people seem to have no idea how to behave at the movies any more, lighting up the room as they constantly fiddle with their phones and gassing to their neighbour \u2013 and I think I see as many, if not more, films as I used to, if a bit later than everyone else.

      "bodyText": "Until recently, cinemas were seen as pretty much a no-go zone for older people. There might be the occasional \"silver screening\" in a teatime slot, but the rest of the time noisy youngsters would hold sway \u2013 crunching popcorn, spilling Coke on the floor and texting during the show. On screen, vampires, aliens, superheroes, childish fantasy, gross-out comedy or preposterous spectacle would probably prevail. All of the above are still in evidence, but different fare has also come to the fore. In The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel a cast of ageing national treasures grapple with the tribulations of later life. Grown-up dramas such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Descendants, The Ides of March, The Iron Lady and The Artist have elbowed their way in. The arrival and success of such films reflects a little-noticed revolution. Older people are returning to the big screen. They want something different, and the industry is trying to give it to them. Typical of what's coming shortly is Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, in which a scientist finds \"late-blooming love\" amid dusty wadis. Dustin Hoffman's directing debut, Quartet, will feature a group of opera singers living in a retirement home. It is estimated that around a third of forthcoming Hollywood productions are being made with an eye on older audiences. The change of tack involved is historic. Cinema's decades-long fixation on young people began in the 1970s. Its once huge working-class audience had defected to television, and the box-office was in crisis. However, teenagers born in the postwar baby boom were acquiring more money and wider horizons. Anxious studios won them over with simple, thrilling and spectacular films including Jaws and Star Wars. Thus dawned the era of the multiplex, in which the young not only flocked to repetitive franchise movies but spent eagerly on popcorn, soft drinks and spin-off albums and games. Ticket sales recovered and profits soared. In Britain, annual admissions rose from 54 million in 1984 to 176 million in 2002. Yet cinema's concentration on the young was to prove precarious. Like their own parents, the baby-boomers eventually defected to television, which now offered more mature drama than the big screen. At first, their offspring's enthusiasm kept the cinemas thriving, but then this started to waver.Social networking, gaming and other electronic competitors began to distract young filmgoers. They discovered that if they wanted to watch movies, they could just steal them from file-sharing websites. In Britain, audience levels fell back from that 2002 high-watermark. In America, attendances by 18- to 24-year-olds slumped by 12% in 2010 alone. The industry tried to head off this threat with films that were even more spectacular, and increasingly in 3D. However, these cost more to make. That meant higher ticket prices, which the young, who no longer felt so flush, began to resent. In any case, ratcheting up spectacle indefinitely began to look creatively implausible. Yet as anxiety grew, the cavalry were arriving from an unexpected quarter. Between 1995 and 2010 the number of over-50-year-old Americans who regularly visited the cinema increased by 68%. In Britain, the proportion of over-45s among regular filmgoers rose from 14% in 1997 to 30% in 2008. These figures reflect a sharp behavioural change. When baby-boomers become empty-nesters, they refuse to languish on the sofa like their predecessors. Freed from the need for babysitters, they want to go out and enjoy themselves. To them, cinemas seem good value compared with theatres and restaurants, and they recall affectionately their youthful delight in the medium. Other businesses were quick to capitalise on the grey pound, but cinema was slow off the mark. Hollywood had come to think of older people as \"the once-a-year audience\". Studios did not even bother to test-screen films on the over-50s. The industry evaluated its performance by weekend opening figures, which left out older cinemagoers, who often prefer to wait and see. However, older people are now the fastest-growing age-group in the western world. Only a minority of them have already become filmgoers, so there is plenty of slack to take up. Young people on the other hand will not only become proportionately fewer; they are mostly multiplex regulars already, so they offer little scope for growth in the market. Bit by bit, cinema began to respond to these realities. It had plenty of ground to make up. As Bill Mechanic, the head of Hollywood's Pandemonium Films, put it to Variety: \"Audiences have aged dramatically, and movies generally haven't.\" Older people have different tastes from the younger people: effects-heavy spectaculars generally leave them cold. In 2010, the highest-grossing films in Britain were Toy Story 3, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Alice in Wonderland. However, the films attracting the highest proportion of over-55s were The Ghost, Burke and Hare and Made in Dagenham. Data like this shows that, as might be expected, older people enjoy films about maturity and the past. They are also keen on reality-based material such as documentaries and biopics. Above all, they warm to good stories with rounded characters. Early attempts to meet these demands were considered heavy-handed by some. Space Cowboys, in 2000, was dubbed by critics \"grumpy old men in space\". Still, it found a grateful audience. More recently, Red and The Expendables, both of which feature ageing action men, have taken more than \u00a3300m between them. The latter carried the tagline, \"Still armed. Still dangerous. Still got it.\" The silvering screen has dealt successfully with the tribulations of ageing, as in Iris and Away From Her, but greying filmgoers do not insist on age-focused fare. Titles as different as Mamma Mia!, The Queen, It's Complicated, Eat Pray Love, Up in the Air, The Fighter, Black Swan and The King's Speech have all proved popular with older cinemagoers. \"What's been happening over the past couple of years is that there's been a big emphasis on making quality films,\" says Andrew Myers, the chief executive of Everyman Cinemas. \"Undoubtedly, the older audience recognises quality. They see through films that are not so well made.\" It is not only the studios that have needed to up their act; the cinemas also face difficulties. Their window of first-run exclusivity is under attack from online streaming and download. However, older film-lovers are less interested in these newer platforms. Understandably, they are now being eagerly wooed. Comfortable bars and lounges have made cinemas more welcoming, and the arrival of digital projection has made their offering more flexible. \"What you should increasingly see is cinemas being able to programme a much broader range of films,\" says Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the Cinema Exhibitors' Association. Esoteric new releases will become more widely available, as well as remastered versions of much-loved classics such as Chariots of Fire. Boutique chains such as the Everymans have expanded, while locally owned venues offer innovations ranging from gourmet food to armchairs in the circle. Even the multiplexes once shunned by older people are changing. The Vue chain provides special screenings for over-18s policed by staff ready to pounce on any distracting behaviour. It also offers wider seats with extra legroom and Green &amp; Black's chocolate in the foyer. \"We're constantly updating the technology and the environment,\" says Mark de Quervain, Vue's director of sales and marketing. In the light of such action, admissions are now rising again in Britain. Last year, they reached 171 million, close to that 2002 peak. The production business can also hope for a more sustainable future. Youth-targeted blockbusters have served the industry well, but they impose huge strain. To make just one can cost up to \u00a3200m. Ideally, it should earn a lot more back, but one flop can put a whole studio at risk. The resulting nervousness means that past success is copied, and staleness lies in store. The character-based dramas that older people prefer cost much less to make, and therefore need to earn less. The King's Speech cost \u00a310m. If it had flopped, it wouldn't have mattered too much. In fact, it has taken \u00a3260m worldwide. Blockbusters can make much more than that, but they can never deliver that kind of multiple. Lower costs mean more films can be made. Riskier projects can be pursued instead of tired sequels to past hits, and these may open new creative avenues. Hollywood studios are showing more interest in non-tentpole projects with budgets of less than \u00a330m, but on this terrain, smaller players can also operate. The future looks brighter for imaginative independents and new entrants bringing fresh tricks with them. Ageing audiences might have been expected to resist novelty. Yet although older filmgoers may like feel-good, sentimental and reassuring fare, they are also ready to be challenged. In Britain, 63% of arthouse fans are over 35. The future of Britain's own film-makers looks particularly promising. \"Where British production generally succeeds is in making richer, deeper, more thought-provoking films,\" says Alex Stolz, a senior executive at the British Film Institute. \"These tend to have quite an older-skewing audience.\" Older filmgoers are disproportionately supportive of British output, and their enthusiasm is paying dividends. Last year, independently made British films were responsible for an unprecedented 13% of UK box-office takings. Overall, more varied and locally based fare should make cinema more fulfilling, and help it reclaim some of its lost respect. This may benefit even the light-headed young, as films favoured by older people can end up broadening less developed appetites. At first, 60% of the audience for The King's Speech was over 50, but this changed very quickly. \"The first Orange Wednesday was bigger than the opening Friday,\" says Paul Brett, the film's executive producer. \"That's a huge signal that it was already reaching a younger audience.\" The most cost-effective films are those that appeal to all age-groups at once. Hence, the industry's holy grail has become the \"inter-generational movie\". Animations aimed primarily at children have long been laced with sophisticated jokes to keep their parents awake. With Up, however, Pixar took things further. The hero was a 70-year-old man with a walking stick.Some doubted whether children would wear this, but they need not have worried: globally, the film has taken \u00a3460m. \"More and more of the movies arriving now have potential for cross-over between the generations,\" says Mark Batey, the chief executive of the Film Distributors' Association. \"Marigold won't just appeal to the over-60s: it has something for everyone. On one level Hugo was a kid's adventure story set in a railway station; on another, it was a reflection on the origins of cinema.\" The future may hold not just more films for older people but better films for everyone. During the past few years, there have been signs in Britain that not just the over-45s, but their immediate juniors, the over-25s and the over-35s, are also going to the cinema more often, while the 15-24s remain the keenest fans. Maybe we are inching towards a cinema that caters for all age-groups at once, as it used to in the 1940s, when audiences were 10 times what they are today . Then, cinemas were the mainstay of communities. Now, a retreat into individualised entertainment has not only been eating away at social life, but dividing the young from the old. Increasingly, youth and age speak different languages, live in different worlds and enjoy distinct cultural experiences. Tension between the generations is rising for a variety of reasons, but a common space and shared interest might rebuild a rapport. Recently, the BFI has been experimenting with screenings in village halls. \"These events really do bring the whole community together,\" says Stolz. \"There, you can see a template for social cohesion.\" By wending their way back to our cinemas, the baby-boomers may be doing us all a favour. They could be helping to reconcile young and old. Carry on filmgoing, seniors.",

      "bodyText": "Hi David, you've just cancelled your tour (1 \u2013 see footnotes below) \u2013 that must be very disappointing. It's inconvenient on so many levels. There's a lot of discomfort involved; I'm going through a series of epidurals just to get myself back on my feet again. What was it like for you to go back to early solo material such as Ghosts and Bamboo Houses for your latest retrospective release, A Victim of Stars (2)? To be honest, I had very little to do with the compilation. I left it in EMI's hands, and it developed into a full-blown retrospective which I was extremely happy about because it gives a much fuller picture of what I've been doing throughout the past 30-odd years. Ghosts is like a touchstone in that respect. You can see some kind of the development of that original idea of the deconstruction of the popular song, and you can hear that echoed throughout my work in different periods. Do you have a favourite pop song? No I don't, not really, there are so many. I don't listen to a lot of music any more and even the people I've loved for years \u2013 the Nick Drakes of this world \u2013 I can't go back to them and listen to them over and over. Creating a decent pop song is a challenge \u2013 and occasionally, once in every decade \u2013 it's kind of fun to do that. That's the kind of writing I've been doing with Joan Wasser (3). You've always mixed experimental tracks with more song-based material. Do you think audiences respond to experimentation when it works? No idea! You hear the lament that you go to see your favourite artist and you expect to hear the songs from the Best Of collection \u2013 but I don't. If I went to a Dylan concert, I'd rather hear his new material, what his heart is involved in now, rather than what he wrote when he was 25 years old. That doesn't make any sense to me. The public so often want to freeze the artist in a moment in time when they were at their peak, and they want the artist to revisit it over and over again as if it was something authentic. Is A Victim of Stars a reference to cosmology, or your pop star days, when you were \"the most beautiful man in the world\" (4)? It was a song I wrote with Hector Zazou in the early 90s (5). I actually handed out a number of different titles and that was the one that was selected. For me, it works on a number of different levels. I'm not a fatalist by any means, but I think there is a certain aspect of predestination to some degree \u2026 there are life lessons laid out before you, almost like hurdles that have to be overcome to allow you to move forward. In that sense we all are a victim of stars. Was it difficult to get in touch with people such as Ryuichi Sakamoto (6) in the 80s when you couldn't just email or tweet them? Back in the day it was a little bit odd, because you had to work through labels and management. I met Ryuichi in Japan when he was invited to interview us for a publication, and we got on really well. The interview itself was probably pretty damn awful \u2013 neither party speaking that much \u2013 but afterwards, once the microphones were switched off, we just got on very well. If gentlemen used to take Polaroids (7), do they take Hipstamatic pics on their iPhones now? No, I think they take Viagra now! What would you tell the 1982 version of David Sylvian, and what do you think the 82 version would think of you now? Oh gosh \u2026 I'm not really sure! If I could be that nurturing voice to the younger man, it would be beautiful to have found his voice earlier, in every sense of the word, and to not be afraid of moving away from the limelight sooner than I did. It wasn't something I enjoyed. I think if the young man was looking at the older man that I am, I would hope that he'd be saying: \"That's where I want to be in 30 years' time.\" I was working with people like Holger Czukay (8) and looking at them and thinking, you're just following an idiosyncratic path that is so beautiful because it is just made purely of your choice, and born of your own needs, and your own aesthetic. Do you have any good jokes? Gosh, do I have any jokes? My lord \u2026 I should have, I'm always joking with the kids (9). Let me think for a second, I have a terrible time retaining them \u2026 I like the old Tommy Cooper joke, the one that goes: Guy walks into a pet shop and says, \"I'd like to buy a wasp.\" And the shop owner says, \"I'm sorry sir, but we don't carry wasps.\" \"Well that's funny, there's one in the window.\" Foot notes (1) Sylvian postponed his Implausible Beauty tour due to a \"lower back injury\". (2) A Victim of Stars, 1982-2012 is out on Virgin. (3) AKA Joan As Policewoman; Sylvian is recording an album with her. (4) \u00a9 Smash Hits/every tabloid headline writer in the, 1980s. (5) On Zazou's Sahara Blue, released in 1992. (6) Sakamoto played in the Yellow Magic Orchestra, huge in Asia in the late 70s/early 80s. (7) Gentlemen Take Polaroids, 1980, Japan's fourth studio album. (8) A founding member of Krautrock legends Can, Czukay played \"French horn, voice, guitar, dictaphone\" on Sylvian's debut solo album Brilliant Trees. (9) Sylvian has two daughters with his ex-wife Ingrid Chavez, who played on Prince's Lovesexy album, appeared in Graffiti Bridge as Prince's love interest, and received an out-of-court settlement after not being credited for her work on the Madonna/Lenny Kravitz single Justify My Love.",

In an interview with the House Magazine, Pickles said: \"In terms of wanting people, encouraging people, to be part of British society, they can't do that unless they have more than an understanding of English. If we don't get our resident population with an understanding of English, then they become a sub-class \u2026 virtually unemployable or stuck in a ghetto.

It said the government \"wants\" immigrants to speak English. In the interview, Pickles said there would be a \u00a310m grant to promote the teaching of English. He said he wanted to achieve \"real integration, an opportunity for people to meet, to mix, to be engaged in activities beyond their ethnic group\". \"I think that is massively important,\" he said. Pickles said the government wanted to find common ground to allow communities to unite. \"We have always been of the view that if the Muslim community of Britain, British Muslims, are seen as the enemy within, then the forces of extremism win. It is certainly my view that we should be able to unite on the things we have in common, rather than constantly harp on the things that we have that are different.\" The communities secretary said he had no time for people who want to ban Muslim women from wearing the burqa. \"We are a tolerant nation and, frankly, I have absolutely no patience in adopting a kind of French system that is going to remove people from wearing headscarves,\" he said. \"I think we are a little bit more confident and relaxed in our culture for that.\" Pickles explains that his background growing up in Keighley and Bradford in the 1950s and 1960s helped shape his views on integration. \"I can remember asking my mum why there was a sign up in a shop that said 'no blacks in here' or something to that effect in Bradford, when I was not very old at all,\" he says. \"It is quite right that we have introduced laws to outlaw that kind of thing.

      "bodyText": "It is now almost five days since lovable erstwhile I'm A Celeb winner Stacey Solomon was snapped smoking a cigarette while seven months pregnant \u2013 and who could fail to rule that the public outcry has fallen immeasurably short of what is required? Admittedly, Stacey has taken such an onslaught of abuse that she had to call in to Loose Women and insist miserably that there was no defence for what she had done. Admittedly, Stacey was then forced to do the same in person on the This Morning sofa, sobbing: \"I don't want people to think it's OK or that I think it's OK.\" Admittedly, whole armies of commenters continue to flock to internet sites to unleash waves of radioactive sanctimony and accusations of foeticide. And admittedly, Stacey has been publicly stripped of her Celebrity Mum of the Year title (and yes, we shall be dealing with this aspect of the tale more fully shortly). But does such an edifying reaction even scratch the surface of punishing Stacey for the three-a-day cigarette habit of which she is bitterly ashamed? Should not a scarlet letter be pinned to this young mother's front for all eternity, the better to allow civilised society to showcase her sin? Once the mite is born, she may seek to obscure the mark by clasping it to her chest but, as Nathaniel Hawthorne so rightly observed: \"One token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another.\" And yet, and yet \u2026 Lost in Showbiz can't help but think at least some of the outrage might be apportioned differently \u2013 a bit like when pictures of Kerry Katona doing coke in her bathroom were published in the News of the World, and people were very intent on getting her sacked as the face of Iceland and not on wondering what a newspaper camera was doing in her own bathroom. So, what of the paparazzo who opted to spend his day stalking a pregnant woman with a long lens and waiting for her to make a mistake? (I assume he is so embarrassed about the way he earns a living that he tells his parents he works in animal porn.) What of the cortisol-pushers in the news media, who have decreed that the only bit of foetal science to which you need to pay any attention is the bit that says Stacey's a monster, as opposed to questioning whether it's seemly to send up the stress hormone levels of a seven-months-pregnant woman in the interests of filling their schedules or baiting their commenters? What indeed of that unofficial parental police force: \"No darling, Mummy can't play with you because she needs three hours of her special computer time to post sub-amoebic comments beneath paparazzi pictures of celebrities with their children explaining what crap parents they are.\" (Why don't those spoilt Beckham brats smile for the paparazzi following them from school? Why does Amanda Holden think she can dare do four days' light work after having a baby and not be called a witch? WHY HASN'T SURI CRUISE GOT A COAT ON?) For Stacey, alas, the bloodsport has been less enjoyable. Monday's public shaming saw Foxy Bingo publicly strip her of the Celebrity Mum of the Year title it had bestowed upon her \u2013 and Stacey meekly accept her punishment. \"I feel that they have to set a good example,\" she said. \"So it's absolutely their decision and I have to accept it because at the end of the day they can't be seen to support that.\" Mm. It does seem time to hear a little more from these moral arbiters \u2013 but unsurprisingly, Foxy Bingo's press officer was too busy to come to the phone. Perhaps he was at prayer or tending to the sick. You see, when Lost in Showbiz heard Stacey had been defrocked, I assumed Foxy Bingo was some saintly body along the lines of Mother Teresa's sisterhood or the Red Cross. Imagine how silly I felt to discover it is a gambling website, and was thus obviously being brilliantly self-parodic to judge Stacey on moral grounds. Had the PR not been tied up all day, he might have talked me through the nominations process for the mum of the year contest \u2013 whether it involves international elections monitors and so on. You see, to the untrained eye, it looks like Foxy Bingo accepts nominations for yummy mummies such as Sam Cam and Louise Mensch and Holly Willoughby, then for good measure a few of them sit round the office picking out some working-class ones, going: \"Ooh, she's a shit mother, let's put her in.\" Or, as tabloid anti-darling \u2013 and mysterious nominee \u2013 Natasha Giggs inquired of her Twitter abusers this week: \"can u not see I was nominated to get u all talkin about it?\" So on the whole, I think we really must salute Foxy Bingo for promoting its gambling website by encouraging others to vilify strangers' perceived parenting skills. In fact, in order to extract the maximum amount of publicity from this charming stunt, perhaps it could introduce a second official annual ceremony, for the inevitable moment the Mum of the Year is formally stripped of her title. But of course, I know what you're thinking. Is there a sentient being over the age of seven \u2013 or perhaps a particularly unintelligent species of plant \u2013 who takes the remotest notice of such fatuous marketing ploys, let alone a single living organism that would actually modify their consumer behaviour in judgment of whoever could be found to turn up to a photoshoot and receive their sponsorship cheque? Yes. Yes there is, and its botanical name is Janet Street-Porter. \"Sick Joke,\" opined Janet shortly before John Terry was stripped of the England football captaincy (not this time \u2013 the time before). \"John Terry was chosen as 'Dad of the Year' by Daddies Sauce. That's a product I won't be buying any more.\" And looking back with the perspective that only the passage of time can afford, I now wonder which was more historically awful: John Terry's sinful failure to realise that bros come before hos, or the depletion \u2013 perhaps even decimation \u2013 of the Street-Porter condiment cupboard. Something for the Stacey-haters to ponder, certainly.",

Admittedly, Stacey has taken such an onslaught of abuse that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSuVEFuNe7c\" title=\"\">she had to call in to Loose Women</a> and insist miserably that there was no defence for what she had done. Admittedly, Stacey was then forced to do the same in person <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSej-3kPei4\" title=\"\">on the This Morning sofa</a>, sobbing: \"I don't want people to think it's OK or that I think it's OK.\" Admittedly, whole armies of&#xa0;commenters continue to flock to internet sites to unleash waves of radioactive sanctimony and accusations of foeticide. And admittedly, Stacey has been publicly stripped of her Celebrity Mum of the Year title (and yes, we shall be dealing with this aspect of the tale more fully shortly).</p> <p>But does such an edifying reaction even scratch the surface of punishing Stacey for the three-a-day cigarette habit of which she is bitterly ashamed? Should not a scarlet letter be pinned to&#xa0;this young mother's front for all eternity, the better to allow civilised society to showcase her sin? Once the mite is born, she may seek to obscure the mark by clasping it to her chest but,&#xa0;as Nathaniel Hawthorne so rightly&#xa0;observed: \"One token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide&#xa0;another.\"</p> <p>And yet, and yet \u2026 Lost in Showbiz can't help but think at least some of the&#xa0;outrage might be apportioned differently \u2013 a bit like when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/aug/18/kerry-katona-iceland\" title=\"\">pictures of&#xa0;Kerry Katona doing coke in her bathroom were published in the News of the World</a>, and people were very intent on getting her sacked as the face of Iceland and not on wondering what a newspaper camera was doing in her own bathroom.</p> <p>So, what of the paparazzo who opted to spend his day stalking a pregnant woman with a long lens and waiting for her to make a mistake? (I&#xa0;assume he is so embarrassed about the way he earns a living that he tells his parents he works in animal porn.) What of the cortisol-pushers in the news media, who have decreed that the only bit of foetal science to which you need to pay any attention is the bit&#xa0;that says Stacey's a monster, as opposed to questioning whether it's seemly to send up the stress hormone levels of a seven-months-pregnant woman in the interests of filling their&#xa0;schedules or baiting their&#xa0;commenters?</p> <p>What indeed of that unofficial parental police force: \"No darling, Mummy can't play with you because she needs three hours of her special computer time to post sub-amoebic comments beneath paparazzi pictures of celebrities with their children explaining what crap parents they are.\" (Why don't those spoilt Beckham brats smile for the paparazzi following them from school? Why does Amanda Holden think she can dare do four days' light work after having a baby and not be called a witch?

Chief cougar Jules (Courteney Cox) has been through the divorced-mum-starting-over phase and is now out the other side. She's not happy when Grayson calls her predictable, but maybe he's just trying to hide that big old surprise he has up his sleeve. Bizarrely, it involves lots of toilet paper. Elsewhere, deadpan best mate Ellie and her husband Andy have bigger things to worry about as Stan appears to be turning into their very own devil child. Hannah Verdier New Girl 8.30pm, Channel 4 This week it's Schmidt's 29th birthday. A reunion with a teen buddy might cheer him up, however, as the gang set off on a drunken and ill-fated party bus ride, in which the hasty booking of a \"last-minute stripper\" by Jess leads to an unfortunate mix-up. New Girl is perky as a button but the absence of a laugh track doesn't make it more sophisticated; rather, the effect is to reduce the gag count, and its very cuteness remains grating at times. David Stubbs Melvyn Bragg On Class &amp; Culture 9pm, BBC2 The final part of Melvyn Bragg's series brings us from the late-70s to the present and the fact that Bragg himself was in this period already a TV eminence ups the objective quality of his writing and reporting here. What we're dealing with, in large part, is the decline of British heavy industry presided over by Margaret Thatcher. Whether the cultural responses to this were immediate (as with 2Tone music) or emerged years later (in, say, the film Billy Elliot), the response of the assailed working classes was both polemical and impossible to ignore. John Robinson Still Bill: The Bill Withers Story 9pm, BBC4 So ubiquitous were his two most famous tunes, Lovely Day and Ain't No Sunshine, the man who recorded them can sometimes be left in their long shadow. And yet, in the person of gentle newcomer Michael Kiwanuka and with a resurgence of interest in Bill Withers' brand of smooth soul, time is probably right for this portrait of the humble ex-serviceman, a man whose writing and wise publishing decisions have made him a role model for how to assume responsibility for oneself in the music business. JR The Secret Policeman's Ball 10pm, Channel 4 Amnesty brings its comedy fundraiser to the US for the first time to celebrate the organisation's 50th birthday. The line-up is an Atlantic-straddling bobby dazzler at New York's Radio City Music Hall: the US contingent includes Jon Stewart, Sarah Silverman and Kristen Wiig, and the UK sends Peter Serafinowicz, Noel Fielding and Russell Brand. Music comes from Coldplay and Mumford &amp; Sons. The ball always comes off best when it's a combination of standup and sketch comedy, so fingers crossed for some surprise team-ups. Julia Raeside The Walking Dead 10pm, FX Things are looking up, if for the viewers more than the characters. While they still don't seem to be in much of a hurry to leave Herschel's farm, the gang do at least venture, reminding us all there's a big, wide, zombie-filled world out there. After their adventure last week, Rick and Shane are pals again, something Dale does not see as a good thing.

      "bodyText": "Teams: Sporting: Patricio, Carrico, Polga, Insua, Schaars, Izailov, Capel, Fernandez, Pereira, Xandao, van Wolfswinklel Subs: Marcelo, Alberto Rodriguez, Evaldo, Pereinha, Neto, Rubio City: Hart, K Tour\u00e9, Kompany, Clichy, Barry, De Jong, Silva, Milner, Kolarov, Dzeko, Aguero Subs: Pantilimon, Lescott, Pizarro, Johnson, Savic, Nasri, Balotelli Ref: C Carballo (Spain) Preamble: Mercator projection is the 16th-century technique for representing the globe on a map in such a way as to make Africa and South America much smaller than in reality and Europe much more important. Those maps aren't used much beyond Daily Mail offices any more but a footballing corollary has emerged this season and become irritatingly prominent: Manchester projection, the technique for representing the entire 872-round Europa League knockout process as a preliminary for an all-Manchester final. This is despite the fact that in European competition this season Manchester United have looked about as comfortable as a tipped cow in an abattoir, especially at Old Trafford, where they have won just one of four European ties this season. We'll see how they cope with the visit of Athletic Bilbao a little later this evening; but before that their neighbours will try to subdue Sporting Clube de Portugal - or Sporting Lisbon to you and me; they'll have to do so without Yaya Tour\u00e9 - the greatest midfield marauder the Premier League has seen since Roy Keane - but will still be confident of beating the team who, in their domestic league, are three places behind Porto, the team taht City savaged in the lat round. Except they didn't really savage them, did they? The scoreline looked emphatic but they were actually outplayed for considerable periods in both ties and were grateful for wretched Porto finishing. If Sporting have their shooting boot on, they could worry Robert Mancini's men. 5.57pm: As the teams saunter out on to the pitch, it's time to put your cartographs on the table: \"You're right about the Mercator projection, oil industry now uses Transverse Mercator (TM) or Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) - way more sexy,\" gusges Egyptian Green. 1 min:Off we pop. Good to see Sporting manager Ricardo Sa Pinto with patches on the elbows of his jacket. Such pragmatism is often sacrificed in the name of chic. I bet he has a sensible pair of mittens in his pocket too, just in case. 2 min: City are playing with a 4-4-2, with Clichy in an unfamiliar right-back position. Hart, meanwhile, had to serve as sweeper jsut now, charging out of his box to head a through-ball clear. Schaars retrieved it and attempted to lob it into the net from 40 yards, but it dropped just wide. 5 min: City enjoying lion'sahre of possession so far but clustered defence keeping them at bay. 7 min: Here's woe for City: Kompany is hobbling off, feeling his calf. They don't want to go into the Premier League title run-in relying on Stefan Savic .... 9 min: Lescott is limbering up and looks primed to replace Kompany. Micah Richards, since you didn't ask, is not even on the bench, seemingly not having fully recovered from his hamstring knack. Meanwhile, Sporting work their way down the right and into the City box, whereupon Pereira unleashes a fierce drive from 16 yards. Hart parries. 11 min: Milner exchanges a short corner with Silva and then flips in a tempting cross. Tour\u00e9 rises well to bonk it towards goal, bringing a fine reflex save from Patricio. \" I just finished reading the Fiver before switching to the mbm - wow!\" yelps Joe Pearson. \"D\u00e9ja vu. Is it possible to plagiarise oneself?: It is if you try hard enough. Or, as in my case, if you don't feel like trying very hard at all. 14 min: This is getting increasingly uncomfortable for City, as Sporting are showing themselves to be nimble contrivers. But it's making for a pleasing spectacle. 16 min: Aguero is looking very lively and an obvious threat every time City rumble forward. Sporting are just about containing him for now. 19 min: Kolarov has ample time and space to size up a cross from the left but it's easily cleared and suddenly Sporting tear forward on the counter-attack, with four forwards agaisnt three defenders. Unhappily for the hosts, Fernandez botched the opportunity with a wayward pass. 22 min: So a pattern seems to have been established: City enjoying most of the territory and possesion but Sporting contanstaly poised to luanch rapid counters. 24 min: Good effort by Barry, curling a shot fractionally wide from the edge of the area. 26 min: Fernandez wriggles his way into the City box before Lescott diverts the ball out for a corner. Fernandez takes, Hart claims comfortably. 28 min: Sparkling ball by Dzeko to find Kolarov, who is again in loads of space on the left. His cross was dangerous enough to force the concession of a corner, which Milner takes. It fails to beat the first man. 30 min: Balotelli gets off the bench to warm up, and Sporting manager Ricardo Sa Pinto stops him for a handshake. Is there anyonme who doesn't admire Balotelli? 33 min: Pereira's cross from the right - after sustained pressure from Sporting - flicks off Kolarov and requires an intervention from Hart, who palms it over the bar for a corner. City clear it easily. It's about time Sporting came up with a new ploy from them, as they are winning absolutely nothing in the air. 36 min: A lull on the pitch coincides with a surge of good emails to my inbox. Well, at least one. \"I notice that Twente are in action in the Europa league tonight as well, and that they've been doing pretty well in the Dutch league since McClaren returned,\" toots David wall. \"If Redknapp were to turn England down and stick with Spurs might the FA consider going back to their former employee? And would that make him second-choice-squared Schteve?\" Forget Harry, it's got to Roy Hodgson for England. 39 min: Carrico decides to see whether Hart is still awake by firing in a swirling shot from 30 yards. But it swirled all the way wide. 41 min: What is the problem with Portugal and strikers? The national team haven't had a top class one for decades (Pedro Pauleta wasn't quite the beans) and Sporting, like Porto in the last round, have perfected the trick of looking really impressive and dangerous right up until they get to the box. Are there stats available on the number of bald men in Portgual? I'm guessing it's high, what with all the hair that must be wrenched out in frustration. 44 min: Izailov booked for an angry trip on Dzeko around half-way. 45 min: lescott flights in a freekick from deep. Dzeko helps it on to Aguero, who can't get sufficient power in his header to trouble Patricio. 45+1 min: The man City players dub Kung Fu Panda adds another yellow card to his collection, for a foul on his fellow Dutchman, Van Wolfswinkel. Half-time: A ten-minutes void looms. How should we fill it? Cometh the hour, cometh the man, at last: \"I've waited many years to be one of the 1057 pedants who write in, and here's my chance!\" squeals Mark Ireland. \"The idea of a Mercator map is to preserve angular bearings, not relative size. It's not a right-wing conspiracy to do down developing countries, but a vital property for anyone who wants to travel from one place to another on a constant bearing \u2013 you know, like pilots, ships captains and the like. Incidentally, the Transverse Mercator has all the same properties, but is just rotated 90 degrees for mapping areas that are taller than they are wide \u2013 like the UK. By the way, this is a very timely discussion. It was Mercator's 500th birthday last Monday (though I don't think he's still around to celebrate).\" And another thing: \"Regarding your comment about poor finishing and hair-pulling, may I suggest that Sporting Club de Liverpool has a certain ring to it?\" parps Paul mcCormick. \"I would add that as a Liverpool supporter I have also done away with the need for nail-clippers.\" 46 min: Game is back on and an early goal would do wonders for the spectacle: it started vibrantly enough but kind of stagnated towards the end of the first half, with Sporting unable to turn decent interplay into chances and City unable even to muster much by way of decent interplay. 48 min: Milner completely misses Kolarov's best cross of the match. No matter, it runs through to Silva ... who tonks a pitiful shot high and wide. GOAL! Sporting 1-0 City (Xandao 51') A goalkeeping goof by Hart presents Sporting with a chance to take the lead and Xandao takes it superbly! Hart spilled a tame freekick from Fernandez and then did well to block Xandao's follow-up ... but it rebounded back to the centreback who took the goalkeeper by surprise by backheeling it into the net from five yards! 53 min: City seem to have been sparked into some sort of life, as Aguero hurtles down the left in search of an instant equaliser. His subsequent shot is decent but the angle too acute, and the keeper saves. 55 min: City may be piqued, but Sporting are buoyed so there'll be no easy route back into this game for the visitors. In fact, at the moment their pirority is on nexty conceding again. The home team have just worked Pereira into lots of space down the right and Lescott had to strain sorely to head his cross out for a corner. 58 min: Freekick to City as Pereira pushes over Aguerro at the edge of the area, but at an angle too actue for a shot. Before the freekick is taken, City make a change, withdrawing Barry for Samir Nasri. 59 min: Sporting change: Izmailov off, Pererinha on. 60 min: Excellent effort by Kolarov! Milner pinged the freekick to him at the edge of the box and with no backlift he fired a freakishly powerful shot just past the post. 63 min: Strong running down the right by Capel, who is one of the players who has helped make City look quite sluggish tonight. Clichy eventually forces him to turn back but Sporting recycle possesion well, alarmingly for City, Insua finds himself totally free in their box. As Lescott belatedly comes to challenge he pulls the ball back for Van Wolfswinkel, who shoots straight at Hart from close range! That should have been 2-0. 66 min: The night in a nutshell: Kolarov booked for taking down Carrico - it wasn't nasty, it was just that the Sporting player was quicker and more precise than the Citizen. 68 min: Capel, who has been a menance down the right all night, curls in a fine cross that City defenders watch while Pereirinha stretches out a leg to poke narrowly wide. 69 min: A Kolarov cross skims the bar, the Serbian narrowly denied a fluke equaliser. 71 min: City couldn't cross the road at the moment. Kolarov's deliveries have been mostly woegeous all night and Clichy has just emulated him, shanking the ball into the keeper's arms as team-mates awaited decent service. 72 min: City change: The ineffective Dzeko off, Balotelli on. Here we are now, Mario, entertain us. 73 min: That's a better cross from Kolarov, running all the way to nasri at the far post. The Frenchman's shot gets deflected behind for a corner. 74 min: An instant impact from Balotelli, who collects the ball on the right, drives to the by-line and then conjures an outrageous cross with his trailing leg. Silva gets on the end of it but can't steer his shot on target. 75 min: Sporting change: to a standing ovation Capel exists. Enter Carrillo. 78 min: Kolarov - the Serbian whom I may have referred to earlier on as Bulgarian, just to see if anyoine was paying attention - curls a freekick straight into the wall. Can you send a curler straight into something? OK, sorry. 80 min: Balotelli has made a difference since coming on. Pereira has just become the second player to be booked for trying to contain him illegally. \"S\u00e1 Pinto (i.e. Ricardo Manuel de Andrade da Silva S\u00e1 Pinto) was forced to substitute Izmailov and Fernandez because of fitness concerns. The pair has been injured most of the season,\" reveals ace emailer Antonio Castro henriques. \"Renato Neto, even if Brazilian, is a product of Sporting's famed academy, just like Pereirinha, the other substitute.\" Thanks for the knowledge, Antonio. 84 min: Neto becomes the latest player booked for a foul on Balotelli. 87 min: Silva sends in an out-swining corner. Balotelli leaps backwards and appleis an excellent header ... that bounces down off the bar! 90 min: So close! A Clichy shot deflects into the path of Aguerro, who dinks it past the keeper ... but not Xandao, who blocked it with his thigh before hoofing clear. 90+2 min: Terrific run down the right by Carrillo, followed by an inviting crosses that narrowly eludes Pereinha. 90+3 min: Kolarov lucky to avoid a red card for a two-footed lunge. He escapes with a yellow. Full-time: Sporting have deservedly beaten a sluggish City side, who didn't come to life until it was too late (and after Balotelli's introduction). As well as losing the first leg, City also lost their captain to injury, though the duration of Vincent Kompany's absence is not yet known. Roberto Mancini has certainly had better nights but at least City are still in this tie.",

Those maps aren't used much beyond Daily Mail offices any more but a footballing corollary has emerged this season and become irritatingly prominent: Manchester projection, the technique for representing the entire 872-round Europa League knockout process as a preliminary for an all-Manchester final.</p> <p>This is despite the fact that in European competition this season Manchester United have looked about as comfortable as a tipped cow in an abattoir, especially at Old Trafford, where they have won just one of four European ties this season. We'll see how they cope with the visit of Athletic Bilbao a little later this evening; but before that their neighbours will try to subdue Sporting Clube de Portugal - or Sporting Lisbon to you and me; they'll have to do so without Yaya Tour\u00e9 - the greatest midfield marauder the Premier League has seen since Roy Keane - but will still be confident of beating the team who, in their domestic league, are three places behind Porto, the team taht City savaged in the lat round. Except they didn't really savage them, did they? The scoreline looked emphatic but they were actually outplayed for considerable periods in both ties and were grateful for wretched Porto finishing. If Sporting have their shooting boot on, they could worry Robert Mancini's men.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>5.57pm: As the teams saunter out on to the pitch, it's time to put your cartographs on the table: \"You're right about the Mercator projection, oil industry now uses Transverse Mercator (TM) or Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) - way more sexy,\" gusges Egyptian Green.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong>Off we pop. Good to see Sporting manager Ricardo Sa Pinto with patches on the elbows of his jacket. Such pragmatism is often sacrificed in the name of chic. I bet he has a sensible pair of mittens in his pocket too, just in case.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> City are playing with a 4-4-2, with Clichy in an unfamiliar right-back position. Hart, meanwhile, had to serve as sweeper jsut now, charging out of his box to head a through-ball clear. Schaars retrieved it and attempted to lob it into the net from 40 yards, but it dropped just wide.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> City enjoying lion'sahre of possession so far but clustered defence keeping them at bay.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Here's woe for City: Kompany is hobbling off, feeling his calf. They don't want to go into the Premier League title run-in relying on Stefan Savic ....</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Lescott is limbering up and looks primed to replace Kompany. Micah Richards, since you didn't ask, is not even on the bench, seemingly not having fully recovered from his hamstring knack. Meanwhile, Sporting work their way down the right and into the City box, whereupon Pereira unleashes a fierce drive from 16 yards. Hart parries.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Milner exchanges a short corner with Silva and then flips in a tempting cross. Tour\u00e9 rises well to bonk it towards goal, bringing a fine reflex save from Patricio. \" I just finished reading the Fiver before switching to the mbm - wow!\" yelps Joe Pearson. \"D\u00e9ja vu. Is it possible to plagiarise oneself?: It is if you try hard enough. Or, as in my case, if you don't feel like trying very hard at all.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> This is getting increasingly uncomfortable for City, as Sporting are showing themselves to be nimble contrivers. But it's making for a pleasing spectacle.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Aguero is looking very lively and an obvious threat every time City rumble forward. Sporting are just about containing him for now.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Kolarov has ample time and space to size up a cross from the left but it's easily cleared and suddenly Sporting tear forward on the counter-attack, with four forwards agaisnt three defenders. Unhappily for the hosts, Fernandez botched the opportunity with a wayward pass.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> So a pattern seems to have been established: City enjoying most of the territory and possesion but Sporting contanstaly poised to luanch rapid counters.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Good effort by Barry, curling a shot fractionally wide from the edge of the area.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Fernandez wriggles his way into the City box before Lescott diverts the ball out for a corner. Fernandez takes, Hart claims comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Sparkling ball by Dzeko to find Kolarov, who is again in loads of space on the left. His cross was dangerous enough to force the concession of a corner, which Milner takes. It fails to beat the first man.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Balotelli gets off the bench to warm up, and Sporting manager Ricardo Sa Pinto stops him for a handshake. Is there anyonme who doesn't admire Balotelli?</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Pereira's cross from the right - after sustained pressure from Sporting - flicks off Kolarov and requires an intervention from Hart, who palms it over the bar for a corner. City clear it easily. It's about time Sporting came up with a new ploy from them, as they are winning absolutely nothing in the air.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> A lull on the pitch coincides with a surge of good emails to my inbox. Well, at least one. \"I notice that Twente are in action in the Europa league tonight as well, and that they've been doing pretty well in the Dutch league since McClaren returned,\" toots David wall. \"If Redknapp were to turn England down and stick with Spurs might the FA consider going back to their former employee? And would that make him second-choice-squared Schteve?\" Forget Harry, it's got to Roy Hodgson for England.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Carrico decides to see whether Hart is still awake by firing in a swirling shot from 30 yards. But it swirled all the way wide.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> What is the problem with Portugal and strikers? The national team haven't had a top class one for decades (Pedro Pauleta wasn't quite the beans) and Sporting, like Porto in the last round, have perfected the trick of looking really impressive and dangerous right up until they get to the box. Are there stats available on the number of bald men in Portgual? I'm guessing it's high, what with all the hair that must be wrenched out in frustration.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Izailov booked for an angry trip on Dzeko around half-way.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> lescott flights in a freekick from deep. Dzeko helps it on to Aguero, who can't get sufficient power in his header to trouble Patricio.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> The man City players dub Kung Fu Panda adds another yellow card to his collection, for a foul on his fellow Dutchman, Van Wolfswinkel.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> A ten-minutes void looms. How should we fill it?</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Cometh the hour, cometh the man, at last: </strong>\"I've waited many years to be one of the 1057 pedants who write in, and here's my chance!\" squeals Mark Ireland. \"The idea of a Mercator map is to preserve angular bearings, not relative size.

      "bodyText": "According to Polly Toynbee (Comment, 7 March), I have \"folded\" in my efforts to change the health bill. This presumably means that major changes made as a result of persistent efforts by the Lib Dem team and myself are feeble and ineffective, compared to pushing votes through the Lords, which are likely to be negated in \"ping-pong\" by votes in the Commons. That is what happened to the welfare bill. What I care about is the future of the NHS as a public service accessible to all and free at the point of need. To achieve that depends on whatever approach is most likely to succeed, not on temporary victories for one party or another. On Tuesday, substantial changes were made to the bill by the government on competition (the removal of the competition commission); foundation trusts (with any increase of over 5% in private patient income, Monitor will be able to intervene if it has any adverse affect on patient services); clear duties on tackling inequality; a duty on the National Commissioning Board to make sure every resident is included in a clinical commissioning group; and, earlier, the removal of premiums for the private sector, plus competition to be on quality, not price. Andy Burnham fails to recognise how far the private sector and competition were encouraged by the last two Labour governments. I agree with him that we must ensure that the important role played by strategic health authorities is not lost. Liberal Democrats ha ve also negotiated retaining Monitor, the regulator of foundation trusts, beyond 2016, a major change and one strongly urged by Labour peers and crossbenchers. Shirley Williams Lib Dem, House of Lords \u2022 Evan Harris suggests the Lib Dem conference should call for the health and social care bill to be dropped (The bill must be ditched, 7 March), because we had failed to deliver on the motion put forward at our conference last March. As the lead member of the Lib Dem health team in the House of Lords, and someone who has spent more than 100 hours scrutinising this piece of legislation, I believe Evan has overlooked all the work the Lib Dems have done to change this bill. Evan claims we have failed to deliver most of what the motion called for in respect of competition and marketisation. Firstly, we have ruled out any further competition on price. New providers will be introduced in a more controlled way, and only in areas where they benefit patients. New requirements on transparency for new providers mean they will only be able to refuse patients on clinical grounds, which will effectively outlaw cherrypicking. We have also changed Monitor's principal duty so that it protects patients, rather than promoting competition. Finally, we have made it illegal for the government to favour the private sector over the NHS in the manner of the last Labour government, which paid private providers 11% more than the NHS. I and the rest of the Lords health team look forward to using the conference to debate the details. Judith Jolly Lib Dem, House of Lords \u2022 The opaque wording of the party establishment motion for the Lib Dem conference this weekend, such as \"ensuring that competition in the NHS is in the interests of patients\", shows how far the party leadership has lost the plot. I have admired the hard work of Liberal Democrat colleagues who have been working on the health bill in the Lords. But they have lost sight of the overall picture, which is of a bill that will inevitably continue the move started by the Labour government to increase the commercialisation of the NHS. It is nine months since Nick Clegg refused to accept my advice that the \"pause\" should have been used to stop the bill dead. It is still not too late, but I fear that the party has been whipped into voting for what it does not believe in. The wishes of the public and most people who work in the NHS are clear. Can we rise to the challenge? If not, I fear for the future of the NHS and the future of our party. Tony Greaves Lib Dem, House of Lords \u2022 Many will be in agreement with your editorial on the bill (5 March). However, while rightly criticising Nick Clegg's handling of the bill, you protect the interests of the Lib Dems as a whole by ignoring the role of Lib Dem MPs. If the bill passes, it will be on their record for ever. Margaret Pelling Oxford \u2022 As we showed in Wyre Forest in 2001, in a supposedly democratic country the ballot box is the ordinary person's ultimate weapon against government policy. Sadly no general election is expected soon, but there are local elections due in May. The only sure way to stop the coalition's disastrous health and social care bill is to force a rebellion by 50-60 coalition MPs in the Commons. As this health bill was not a manifesto commitment, there is no obligation for party MPs to support it. We should all inform our sitting coalition MPs that if they support the health bill we will not vote for them at the next general election and, more urgently, we will cast our votes at the local elections for candidates of parties that demand the withdrawal of this bill. Dr Richard Taylor Independent MP for Wyre Forest 2001-10 \u2022 Evan Harris calls for the Liberal Democrat conference to pull the plug on the health and social care bill. For the conference to reject the bill will mean the Lib Dems should leave the coalition and force a general election. Everyone knows this is probably impossible, not least because the Lib Dem peers this week voted against all the amendments designed to limit competition and marketisation of the NHS and also to increase the concepts of co-operation, collaboration and social solidarity within the bill. So much for the Lords \"sorting it out\". So the bill, essentially unchanged by the Lords, will certainly become law despite the opposition of all the health unions, most of the public and most of the royal colleges. Workers in the NHS know they will then have to bend to the will of parliament and produce as good a service as they can under a bill most of them do not support. The last resort will then be for the majority of the public to make it known that they will support the NHS workers in refusing to work under this bill, which is not far short of a revolution \u2013 also probably impossible. The next time the public will have a say will be at the next Westminster elections. For most of us this will seem like a very long time to watch this space. I'm glad I live in Scotland. John Evans Brechin, Angus \u2022 During prime minister's questions last week about the health and social care bill, David Cameron stated that: \"There are 8,200 GP practices covering 95% of the country implementing the health reforms.\" If it is so, this must be taking place under existing legislation and the bill is unnecessary. Alternatively, if implementation requires new legislation but is occurring while the bill is still being considered by parliament, what would a judicial review make of that? Dr E Moran Enfield, Middlesex \u2022 Not all of those seeking to offer alternatives to NHS services are huge multinational businesses. We are part of a group of consultant psychiatrists who are, as a result of the proposed changes in healthcare commissioning, setting up a new independent partnership of consultant psychiatrists. Our chamber aims to offer online consultations to GPs and their patients in their surgeries as well as to the general public. We believe that our service will give GPs \u2013 and the public \u2013 a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way of accessing high-quality psychiatric assessments and consultations. We are using the opportunity presented by the health and social care bill to offer what we believe is a way to improve clinical services in the mental health system. In our view, the chances of getting this sort of innovative scheme off the ground in an unreconstructed NHS, with its combination of monopolistic inertia and vested interests, would be negligible. Although there may be aspects of this bill which need more thought, we think the principle that other willing providers should be empowered to offer services is a good one. These willing providers, as we illustrate, need not be large multinational corporations with an interest in nothing but profit. It would be a pity if an unthinking and blanket opposition to this bill were to stifle initiative and maintain the status quo. Dr Andy Montgomery Dr Matthew T Gilbert Dr Elin Davies Bristol",

      "body": "<p>According to Polly Toynbee (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/05/legal-aid-cut-qcs\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 7 March), I have \"folded\" in my efforts to change the health bill. This presumably means that major changes made as a result of persistent efforts by the Lib Dem team and myself are feeble and ineffective, compared to pushing votes through the Lords, which are likely to be negated in \"ping-pong\" by votes in the Commons. That is what happened to the welfare bill.</p> <p>What I care about is the future of the NHS as a public service accessible to all and free at the point of need. To achieve that depends on whatever approach is most likely to succeed, not on temporary victories for one party or another. On Tuesday, substantial changes were made to the bill by the government on competition (the removal of the competition commission); foundation trusts (with any increase of over 5% in private patient income, Monitor will be able to intervene if it has any adverse affect on patient services); clear duties on tackling inequality; a duty on the National Commissioning Board to make sure every resident is included in a clinical commissioning group; and, earlier, the removal of premiums for the private sector, plus competition to be on quality, not price.</p> <p>Andy Burnham fails to recognise how far the private sector and competition were encouraged by the last two Labour governments. I agree with him that we must ensure that the important role played by strategic health authorities is not lost. Liberal Democrats ha ve also negotiated retaining Monitor, the regulator of foundation trusts, beyond 2016, a major change and one strongly urged by Labour peers and crossbenchers.<br><strong>Shirley Williams</strong><br><em>Lib Dem, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 Evan Harris suggests the Lib Dem conference should call for the health and social care bill to be dropped (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/06/nhs-sake-lib-dems-ditch-health-bill\" title=\"\">The bill must be ditched</a>, 7 March), because we had failed to deliver on the motion put forward at our conference last March. As the lead member of the Lib Dem health team in the House of Lords, and someone who has spent more than 100 hours scrutinising this piece of legislation, I believe Evan has overlooked all the work the Lib Dems have done to change this bill.</p> <p>Evan claims we have failed to deliver most of what the motion called for in respect of competition and marketisation. Firstly, we have ruled out any further competition on price. New providers will be introduced in a more controlled way, and only in areas where they benefit patients. New requirements on transparency for new providers mean they will only be able to refuse patients on clinical grounds, which will effectively outlaw cherrypicking. We have also changed Monitor's principal duty so that it protects patients, rather than promoting competition. Finally, we have made it illegal for the government to favour the private sector over the NHS in the manner of the last Labour government, which paid private providers 11% more than the NHS. I and the rest of the Lords health team look forward to using the conference to debate the details. <br><strong>Judith Jolly </strong><br><em>Lib Dem, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 The opaque wording of the party establishment motion for the Lib Dem conference this weekend, such as \"ensuring that competition in the NHS is in the interests of patients\", shows how far the party leadership has lost the plot. I have admired the hard work of Liberal Democrat colleagues who have been working on the health bill in the Lords. But they have lost sight of the overall picture, which is of a bill that will inevitably continue the move started by the Labour government to increase the commercialisation of the NHS.</p> <p>It is nine months since Nick Clegg refused to accept my advice that the \"pause\" should have been used to stop the bill dead. It is still not too late, but I fear that the party has been whipped into voting for what it does not believe in. The wishes of the public and most people who work in the NHS are clear. Can we rise to the challenge? If not, I fear for the future of the NHS and the future of our party.<br><strong>Tony Greaves</strong><br><em>Lib Dem, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 Many will be in agreement with your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/04/health-and-social-care-bill\" title=\"\">editorial</a> on the bill (5 March). However, while rightly criticising Nick Clegg's handling of the bill, you protect the interests of the Lib Dems as a whole by ignoring the role of Lib Dem MPs. If the bill passes, it will be on their record for ever. <br><strong>Margaret Pelling</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 As we showed in Wyre Forest in 2001, in a supposedly democratic country the ballot box is the ordinary person's ultimate weapon against government policy. Sadly no general election is expected soon, but there are local elections due in May. The only sure way to stop the coalition's disastrous health and social care bill is to force a rebellion by 50-60 coalition MPs in the Commons. As this health bill was not a manifesto commitment, there is no obligation for party MPs to support it. We should all inform our sitting coalition MPs that if they support the health bill we will not vote for them at the next general election and, more urgently, we will cast our votes at the local elections for candidates of parties that demand the withdrawal of this bill.<br><strong>Dr Richard Taylor</strong><br><em>Independent MP for Wyre Forest 2001-10</em></p> <p>\u2022 Evan Harris calls for the Liberal Democrat conference to pull the plug on the health and social care bill. For the conference to reject the bill will mean the Lib Dems should leave the coalition and force a general election. Everyone knows this is probably impossible, not least because the Lib Dem peers this week voted against all the amendments designed to limit competition and marketisation of the NHS and also to increase the concepts of co-operation, collaboration and social solidarity within the bill. So much for the Lords \"sorting it out\". So the bill, essentially unchanged by the Lords, will certainly become law despite the opposition of all the health unions, most of the public and most of the royal colleges. Workers in the NHS know they will then have to bend to the will of parliament and produce as good a service as they can under a bill most of them do not support. The last resort will then be for the majority of the public to make it known that they will support the NHS workers in refusing to work under this bill, which is not far short of a revolution \u2013 also probably impossible. The next time the public will have a say will be at the next Westminster elections. For most of us this will seem like a very long time to watch this space. I'm glad I live in Scotland.<br><strong>John Evans</strong><br><em>Brechin, Angus</em></p> <p>\u2022 During prime minister's questions last week about the health and social care bill, David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120229/debtext/120229-0001.htm#12022956000009\" title=\"\">stated</a> that: \"There are 8,200 GP practices covering 95% of the country implementing the health reforms.\" If it is so, this must be taking place under existing legislation and the bill is unnecessary. Alternatively, if implementation requires new legislation but is occurring while the bill is still being considered by parliament, what would a judicial review make of that?<br><strong>Dr E Moran </strong><br><em>Enfield, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Not all of those seeking to offer alternatives to NHS services are huge multinational businesses. We are part of a group of consultant psychiatrists who are, as a result of the proposed changes in healthcare commissioning, setting up a new independent partnership of consultant psychiatrists. Our chamber aims to offer online consultations to GPs and their patients in their surgeries as well as to the general public. We believe that our service will give GPs \u2013 and the public \u2013 a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way of accessing high-quality psychiatric assessments and consultations.</p> <p>We are using the opportunity presented by the health and social care bill to offer what we believe is a way to improve clinical services in the mental health system. In our view, the chances of getting this sort of innovative scheme off the ground in an unreconstructed NHS, with its combination of monopolistic inertia and vested interests, would be negligible.</p> <p>Although there may be aspects of this bill which need more thought, we think the principle that other willing providers should be empowered to offer services is a good one. These willing providers, as we illustrate, need not be large multinational corporations with an interest in nothing but profit. It would be a pity if an unthinking and blanket opposition to this bill were to stifle initiative and maintain the status quo.<br><strong>Dr Andy Montgomery </strong><br><strong>Dr Matthew T Gilbert</strong><br><strong>Dr Elin Davies</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The rippling grey waters of Eton Dorney Lake in Buckinghamshire will be swollen by sweat and tears this weekend, a monumentally tough landmark moment in what is shaping up to be British rowing's toughest ever spring selection process. On Saturday and Sunday, the venue for the Olympic rowing, Paralympic rowing and canoe sprint events will host a two-day series of closed trials, which will play a crucial \u2013 but by no means definitive \u2013 role in deciding who among the UK's elite oarsmen and women will secure prized seats with the GB Rowing Team for the World Cup season and Olympic Games. Under the intimidating gaze of the German head coach, J\u00fcrgen Gr\u00f6bler, who has coached crews to gold at every Games since Munich 1972, each of the men competing for places in the pair, four or eight will race in pairs across six lanes against their friends and team-mates over the two-kilometre course, as will the women vying for seats in the women's pairs or eight. Britain's adaptive rowers will also contest trials this weekend, at the national training centre in Caversham, with places in the Paralympic four, single and double sculls up for grabs. Renowned for what is considered to be a borderline clairvoyant ability to put the correct rowers in the right boats to maximise medal-winning possibilities, it is intriguing to discover what new information Gr\u00f6bler hopes to glean from charges with whom he could hardly be more familiar. \"Well, the trials will allow me to see how my athletes perform under full pressure,\" he says. \"The training has given me a good idea what to expect, but the trials will show me if I'm right. They'll show me how the athletes handle my expectations and how close they are to each other. We need 14 athletes for the sweep side [one oar per rower], for example, and seven athletes for the sculling side [two oars per rower], and while I know plenty about them all, it's exciting to see how they deal with each other under proper race conditions. It's also a test to see if we can get athletes to peak on the day we want them to.\" Gr\u00f6bler concedes that the pressure on him and his crews in an Olympic year is more extreme than usual, but declares himself to be \"very, very happy with where we are\". Once the trials have been conducted he and his backroom team will go into seclusion, to pore over the results as well as fitness and endurance data accumulated during a gruelling winter slog, before announcing the crews for the first World Cup event in April. The men's sweep team, featuring Olympic and World Cup winners such as Andrew Hodge, Pete Reed, Matt Langridge and Ric Egington, provides a fine example of the selection headaches facing Gr\u00f6bler. With 18 rowers fighting for 14 seats in three boats, he has many combinations to consider and will inevitably be forced to crush the Olympic dreams of several hopefuls, while frustrating others who make the cut but would prefer to sit in a different boat than the one they are put in. Despite a reputation for ruthlessness garnered over 40 years cycling the towpath, breaking bad news remains a part of the job that weighs heavily. \"Now is the toughest time,\" he admits. \"You sit them down at the table, they're looking up to you and asking you for feedback and of course, you're honest and try to encourage them. But ultimately you have to say: 'I'm sorry, there's only eight seats in the boat \u2026 not nine, not 10.' That is hard, I must say, because they have done nothing wrong to me and I have respect for them but somebody has to make the decision and that's my job.\" Offered the choice, now, of three Olympic silvers or just one gold for his charges at London 2012, Gr\u00f6bler weighs up the hypothetical offer. \"I hope we can do a little bit better than just one gold and get maybe another gold \u2026 and a silver,\" he laughs, with the confidence of a man who believes his rowers can quite literally sweep all before them.",

      "bodyText": "The trickle of visitors to Okawa primary school began soon after dawn. Three men in dark overcoats, their shaved heads exposed to the freezing elements, stepped out of their black sedan and bowed before a makeshift shrine that has come to symbolise the most distressing episode of the Japan tsunami disaster. Later, a woman arrived and lit sticks of incense, shielding them from the wind, then lingered in front of the tributes: paper cranes, plastic toys and dolls, a bell and bouquets of flowers. Beside them lay a stone carving of a mother cradling an infant bearing the words: \"Protect the children.\" The message carried extra poignancy for Miho Suzuki, whose two children were among the 74 pupils swept to their deaths last March, along with 10 staff. The body of her son, Kento, was discovered a week later, but after a year-long search, there is still no sign of her eight-year-old daughter, Hana. \"I can't say when or how this pain will end,\" said Suzuki, who makes daily pilgrimages to the school, its concrete shell one of the few structures left standing in Ishinomaki, where 3,097 people died and another 2,770 are still missing. \"We found our son, but we want Hana back, too. When they found my son's body I could at least rub his cold hands and wipe the mud from his face. Until Hana is back my family can't look forward. When she is with us again, perhaps that's when we can start to move on.\" The force of the waves carried bodies for miles along the Tohoku coast or out into the open sea. The official death toll from the disaster stands at 15,854, but another 3,274 \u2013 almost three-quarters of them aged 60 or over \u2013 are unaccounted for. The chances of recovering the corpses, now identifiable only by DNA samples, are receding by the day: search teams found at least 100 bodies a month soon after the disaster, but by the autumn, the number had dropped to a handful. In the fishing town of Kesennuma, police and coastguard crews conduct regular offshore searches in the hope of finding bodies trapped in cars or beneath wreckage resting on the seabed. On the morning the Guardian joined a search team aboard the patrol boat Sasakaze, divers braved icy water and low visibility but returned from the depths with nothing. Only two bodies have been recovered along the entire north-east coast since the start of the year, but coastguard officials insist that the search will go on. \"We know from experience how difficult it is to find people who have been swept out to sea,\" said Hirofumi Onodera, Kesennuma's coastguard captain, whose mother and eldest son are among the missing. \"But we've never thought for a moment of giving up.\" The lone figure of Wataru Sato stood at the water's edge, watching the divers surface briefly before they returned to the bottom of the harbour. Sato, a 68-year-old fisherman, spent weeks looking for his sister, Kiyako, after she was swept off a nearby bridge. \"I looked for her every day for 50 days, and then realised it was no use,\" said Sato, who lost 10 members of his extended family. \"I'm only just beginning to accept that she may never be found.\" The search for bodies continues against a dramatic change in the coastal landscape. Then-and-now photographs are testament to the speed with which the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima have cleared their disfigured cities, towns and villages of debris and rubble. Areas that were once a mass of shattered houses and mangled cars, and boats dragged in by the waves, are now flat, vacant spaces. Improvised memorials of stones, crockery and modest heirlooms are the only sign that these deserted tracts of land were once occupied by houses, shops and schools. But the tidy piles of debris \u2013 an estimated 23m tonnes of it \u2013 also point to an inertia that hangs over the north-east coast. So far only 6% of the rubble has been taken away to be recycled, buried or incinerated, with other regions opposed to taking in material they fear could be radioactive. Debris from Fukushima prefecture is to be stored locally. The environment minister, Goshi Hosono, admitted the current pace of disposal could derail plans to complete the job by March 2014: \"I want to speed up this process because it is a huge barrier to reconstruction efforts,\" he said. Local leaders, meanwhile, are still debating the wisdom of rebuilding in areas that history shows are susceptible to devastating tsunamis. So far not one of the municipalities affected by the disaster has submitted the necessary plans for reconstruction inland or on higher ground, blaming lack of resources and available land, and disagreement among residents. According to one survey, only about half the 6.7tn yen (\u00a352bn) of the reconstruction budget approved last year has been spent, including less than 3% of the cash set aside to repairs roads, levees and sewers. Demand for building materials is rising, but there is little sign of the predicted post-tsunami construction boom, fuelled by government pledges of at least 19tn yen to \"reshape\" the battered coastline. Japan's new reconstruction agency, which has been given the job of slicing through the red tape delaying the recovery, was launched only last month. Yuhei Sato, the governor of Fukushima prefecture, spoke for many when he said: \"From the victims' perspective, I can't help but ask ... couldn't they have launched the agency sooner?\" No one, including the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has articulated a coherent vision for the Tohoku region's recovery. Officials appear reluctant to countenance anything that involves combining neighbouring towns into new, bigger entities, a measure that would sound the death knell for smaller communities but which some experts believe is inevitable. A solution to the rebuilding problem cannot come quickly enough for the 330,000 people living in temporary accommodation. Thousands of others have already left the region in search of jobs and a new start in cities such as Sendai and Tokyo. The exodus is being led by young people, who are abandoning ageing towns and villages that were afflicted by economic decline and depopulation long before the disaster. The immediate humanitarian crisis has given way to concerns about health problems associated with displacement and life in temporary accommodation \u2013 high blood pressure, pneumonia and heart disease \u2013 particularly among elderly people. In the three worst-affected prefectures, the deaths of more than 1,300 people after 11 March have been attributed to the disaster. The total, according to a survey by the Kyodo news agency, includes an undisclosed number of suicides among residents of temporary housing units. \"We are paying more attention to mental health issues now that the emergency response phase has ended,\" said Toshitaka Irie, a Japanese Red Cross worker. \"We are touring temporary housing complexes to try to get people to open up about their trauma. The problem is that in Japan, people tend to keep things to themselves.\" Serious damage to the health infrastructure is hampering efforts to provide healthcare to survivors dotted around a wide area. Hospitals and clinics were among the buildings that were crushed or swept out to sea, while others lie abandoned inside the 12-mile evacuation zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In Ishinomaki, however, there will be little discussion of the future until the wounds of the Okawa tragedy begin to heal. That is unlikely to happen soon. \"Some parents want to keep part of the school as a monument to the disaster,\" said Naomi Hiratsuka, whose 12-year-old daughter, Koharu, was among the victims. \"But I want it to be demolished. There is talk of replacing it with a park, but who would want their children to play in a place like this?\" In the distance, workers dredged a section of river as part of their search for the four missing children and one teacher. \"This search is just for show,\" said Hiratsuka, who obtained a digger's licence while she was searching for her daughter, whose remains were discovered last autumn, several miles from the spot where she died. \"The authorities want to be seen to be doing something for the anniversary. I have been asking them to conduct an intensive search for month, yet it's taken them almost a year to do anything.\" She said her daily search would continue: \"I'll do everything I can to get them back to their families. You look around here and think that everything has changed, but nothing will change as long as they are still somewhere out there.\" Some of the parents considered suing school officials for keeping the 108 children in their charge in the playground for 40 minutes before evacuating to a nearby bridge rather than up a steep hill located a short walk away. Suzuki understands their anger, but for her any recriminations will have to come later. \"No matter how angry I get with the teachers, it won't bring back my children,\" she said. \"What worries me most is that the authorities will call off the search because they're running out of money. But there are still places where we want them to look, even if there's only a small chance of finding anyone. I won't rest until every inch of ground has been covered.\"",

The body of her son, Kento, was discovered a week later, but after a year-long search, there is still no sign of her eight-year-old daughter, Hana.</p> <p>\"I can't say when or how this pain will end,\" said Suzuki, who makes daily pilgrimages to the school, its concrete shell one of the few structures left standing in Ishinomaki, where 3,097 people died and another 2,770 are still missing.</p> <p>\"We found our son, but we want Hana back, too. When they found my son's body I could at least rub his cold hands and wipe the mud from his face. Until Hana is back my family can't look forward. When she is with us again, perhaps that's when we can start to move on.\"</p> <p>The force of the waves carried bodies for miles along the Tohoku coast or out into the open sea. The official death toll from the disaster stands at 15,854, but another 3,274 \u2013 almost three-quarters of them aged 60 or over \u2013 are unaccounted for.</p> <p>The chances of recovering the corpses, now identifiable only by DNA samples, are receding by the day: search teams found at least 100 bodies a month soon after the disaster, but by the autumn, the number had dropped to a handful.</p> <p>In the fishing town of Kesennuma, police and coastguard crews conduct regular offshore searches in the hope of finding bodies trapped in cars or beneath wreckage resting on the seabed.</p> <p>On the morning the Guardian joined a search team aboard the patrol boat Sasakaze, divers braved icy water and low visibility but returned from the depths with nothing. Only two bodies have been recovered along the entire north-east coast since the start of the year, but coastguard officials insist that the search will go on.</p> <p>\"We know from experience how difficult it is to find people who have been swept out to sea,\" said Hirofumi Onodera, Kesennuma's coastguard captain, whose mother and eldest son are among the missing. \"But we've never thought for a moment of giving up.\"</p> <p>The lone figure of Wataru Sato stood at the water's edge, watching the divers surface briefly before they returned to the bottom of the harbour. Sato, a 68-year-old fisherman, spent weeks looking for his sister, Kiyako, after she was swept off a nearby bridge.</p> <p>\"I looked for her every day for 50 days, and then realised it was no use,\" said Sato, who lost 10 members of his extended family. \"I'm only just beginning to accept that she may never be found.\"</p> <p>The search for bodies continues against a dramatic change in the coastal landscape. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/mar/08/japan-tsunami-recovery-interactive\" title=\"\">Then-and-now photographs</a> are testament to the speed with which the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima have cleared their disfigured cities, towns and villages of debris and rubble.</p> <p>Areas that were once a mass of shattered houses and mangled cars, and boats dragged in by the waves, are now flat, vacant spaces. Improvised memorials of stones, crockery and modest heirlooms are the only sign that these deserted tracts of land were once occupied by houses, shops and schools.</p> <p>But the tidy piles of debris \u2013 an estimated 23m tonnes of it \u2013 also point to an inertia that hangs over the north-east coast. So far only 6% of the rubble has been taken away to be recycled, buried or incinerated, with other regions opposed to taking in material they fear could be radioactive. Debris from Fukushima prefecture is to be stored locally.</p> <p>The environment minister, Goshi Hosono, admitted the current pace of disposal could derail plans to complete the job by March 2014: \"I want to speed up this process because it is a huge barrier to reconstruction efforts,\" he said.</p> <p>Local leaders, meanwhile, are still debating the wisdom of rebuilding in areas that history shows are susceptible to devastating tsunamis. So far not one of the municipalities affected by the disaster has submitted the necessary plans for reconstruction inland or on higher ground, blaming lack of resources and available land, and disagreement among residents.</p> <p>According to one survey, only about half the 6.7tn yen (\u00a352bn) of the reconstruction budget approved last year has been spent, including less than 3% of the cash set aside to repairs roads, levees and sewers.</p> <p>Demand for building materials is rising, but there is little sign of the predicted post-tsunami construction boom, fuelled by government pledges of at least 19tn yen to \"reshape\" the battered coastline.</p> <p>Japan's new reconstruction agency, which has been given the job of slicing through the red tape delaying the recovery, was launched only last month. Yuhei Sato, the governor of Fukushima prefecture, spoke for many when he said: \"From the victims' perspective, I can't help but ask ... couldn't they have launched the agency sooner?\"</p> <p>No one, including the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has articulated a coherent vision for the Tohoku region's recovery. Officials appear reluctant to countenance anything that involves combining neighbouring towns into new, bigger entities, a measure that would sound the death knell for smaller communities but which some experts believe is inevitable.</p> <p>A solution to the rebuilding problem cannot come quickly enough for the 330,000 people living in temporary accommodation. Thousands of others have already left the region in search of jobs and a new start in cities such as Sendai and Tokyo. The exodus is being led by young people, who are abandoning ageing towns and villages that were afflicted by economic decline and depopulation long before the disaster.</p> <p>The immediate humanitarian crisis has given way to concerns about health problems associated with displacement and life in temporary accommodation \u2013 high blood pressure, pneumonia and heart disease \u2013 particularly among elderly people.</p> <p>In the three worst-affected prefectures, the deaths of more than 1,300 people after 11 March have been attributed to the disaster. The total, according to a survey by the Kyodo news agency, includes an undisclosed number of suicides among residents of temporary housing units.</p> <p>\"We are paying more attention to mental health issues now that the emergency response phase has ended,\" said Toshitaka Irie, a Japanese Red Cross worker. \"We are touring temporary housing complexes to try to get people to open up about their trauma. The problem is that in Japan, people tend to keep things to themselves.\"</p> <p>Serious damage to the health infrastructure is hampering efforts to provide healthcare to survivors dotted around a wide area. Hospitals and clinics were among the buildings that were crushed or swept out to sea, while others lie abandoned inside the 12-mile evacuation zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.</p> <p>In Ishinomaki, however, there will be little discussion of the future until the wounds of the Okawa tragedy begin to heal. That is unlikely to happen soon. \"Some parents want to keep part of the school as a monument to the disaster,\" said Naomi Hiratsuka, whose 12-year-old daughter, Koharu, was among the victims. \"But I want it to be demolished. There is talk of replacing it with a park, but who would want their children to play in a place like this?\"</p> <p>In the distance, workers dredged a section of river as part of their search for the four missing children and one teacher. \"This search is just for show,\" said Hiratsuka, who obtained a digger's licence while she was searching for her daughter, whose remains were discovered last autumn, several miles from the spot where she died. \"The authorities want to be seen to be doing something for the anniversary. I have been asking them to conduct an intensive search for month, yet it's taken them almost a year to do anything.\"</p> <p>She said her daily search would continue: \"I'll do everything I can to get them back to their families. You look around here and think that everything has changed, but nothing will change as long as they are still somewhere out there.\"</p> <p>Some of the parents considered suing school officials for keeping the 108 children in their charge in the playground for 40 minutes before evacuating to a nearby bridge rather than up a steep hill located a short walk away.</p> <p>Suzuki understands their anger, but for her any recriminations will have to come later.</p> <p>\"No matter how angry I get with the teachers, it won't bring back my children,\" she said. \"What worries me most is that the authorities will call off the search because they're running out of money. But there are still places where we want them to look, even if there's only a small chance of finding anyone. I won't rest until every inch of ground has been covered.\"</p>",

In Dickens, revulsion slides into moral blame. Others have made this connection more overtly. The conservative bioethicist Leon Kass, in constructing a case against genetic cloning, speaks of \"the wisdom of repugnance\". Similarly Lord Devlin, back in 1959 when arguing against the liberalisation of laws concerning homosexuality, insisted that \"intolerance, indignation and disgust \u2026 are the forces behind the moral law\". Tea Party Republican Carl Paladino even impregnated his political flyers condemning a rival candidate with the stench of rotten cabbage. \"You stink\" is more than just a playground taunt. For a moralised version of disgust has regularly been used as the rhetorical weapon of choice against a whole range of people \u2013 against \"foreigners\" and women and homosexuals in particular. And what often gets emphasised in this visceral form of moral assault is the presence of human bodily products: piss, shit, sweat, dead skin, snot, pus, saliva, semen, and blood, especially menstrual blood. But doesn't this moralised version of disgust represent some deep-seated hostility to the constituent elements of our humanity? Human beings smell. And being revolted by human smell feels troublingly connected with being revolted by human beings themselves. For indeed, to love another human being is intimately bound up with what they smell like. And that has nothing much to do with Chanel No 5. Making love is an act of passionate immersion in the physical reality of the other. Which is precisely why Mellors was so engaging as Lady Chatterley's lover: \"I don't want a woman as couldna shit nor piss.\" So how is disgust supposed to relate to moral harm? Because it is perceived to be an indicator of what is bad. Most who study disgust give it an evolutionary function. Disgust represents a fear of contamination. And a great many traditional social boundaries and taboos exist as a way of protecting against contamination. The anthropologist Mary Douglas famously argued that the desire for purity and cleanliness is all about organising offensive things into acceptable social spaces \u2013 a place for everything and everything in its place. But the problem with a moral instinct that's all about policing the social boundaries created by disgust is that the sources of disgust are often the very same things that make us human. Cardinal O'Brien, for instance, is filled with disgust at the thought of gay sex. Which is why he is so intent on maintaining the boundaries of traditional marriage. But what a great many of us see in the Catholic church's response to homosexuality is simply a refusal of love itself \u2013 more specifically, love in all its sticky, squelchy reality. The dirty protests in Northern Ireland by Republican prisoners, who smeared the walls of their cells with their own excrement, were the most extreme politicisation of shit. These protests have recently returned in Maghaberry prison, in response to forced strip searches. If strip searches dehumanise, shit aggressively reasserts the prisoner's humanity. I shit therefore I am. But what asserts humanity also revolts. And revulsion is precisely the reaction that a few months in a tent are bound to amplify, as the screwed up grimaces of bankers passing through St Paul's churchyard have indicated. It wasn't the protest against capitalism per se that offended the conservative mindset; the problem was that the so-called soap dodgers were out of place. They represented a reaction against what the philosopher Thomas Nagel has recently called \"a carefully controlled and cleaned up version of ourselves\". \"Reminders of the mess that lies beneath,\" he continues, \"can cause us to shrink away in disgust.\" Having money and power are some of the most effective ways of keeping raw humanity at bay. They work as a prophylactic against the visceral aspects of human life. Basically, you get other people to deal with the shit. Occupy reminded the City that this vanilla version of humanity is a false consciousness. It is a disturbing message that we often desperately avoid.

      "bodyText": "A British construction worker and his Italian colleague have been murdered by terrorists in north-west Nigeria after being taken hostage in May last year. David Cameron confirmed the death of Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara \u2013 who were working for an Italian construction firm \u2013 after he had authorised a rescue mission. The prime minister said it appeared the two men were murdered by their captors before they could be rescued. The captors posted a video, featuring the men, which warned that they would be killed. The attempted rescue was mounted by British special forces in an intelligence-led operation planned in close co-operation with the Nigerian authorities, well-placed Whitehall sources said. A unit of the Special Boat Service (SBS) tried to free the men \"after a window of opportunity presented itself\", said an official familiar with the incident. \"The operation was based on good intelligence \u2013 the location was right,\" a source added. The SBS team was told to go in when it appeared that Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara were in imminent danger. \"That was the imperative which drove the operation,\" the Whitehall sources said. They described the men's captors as among the \"nastiest al-Qaida-affiliated terrorists there are\". Officials said the operation was planned in advance in the knowledge that the rescuers had to move quickly when intelligence pointed to an opportunity to free the men. But it was clear any attempt to free them was going to be risky. Units of the SBS and the Special Air Service \u2013 the SAS \u2013 are specifically trained to undertake counter-terrorist operations. The men may have been held in Sokoto, a city in Nigeria's north-west, according to Associated Press. There were reports of a house being surrounded by military forces and the sounds of gunfire being heard before an ambulance was called. Security forces had also set up a cordon around the site. A Nigerian group, know as \"al-Qaida in the land beyond the Sahil\", claimed in December that it had captured McManus. The group released a video to Nouakchott News Agency showing a blindfolded and bearded man in an orange vest. Three men in dark clothing stood behind him armed with rifles and a machete. The hostage pictured in the video reportedly asked the British government to respond to the demands of the group in order to spare his life. He also asked for people in Britain to pressure the government to answer the demands of the group so he could return to his family. In a statement, Cameron said: \"Our immediate thoughts must be with Chris and Franco's families, and we offer them our sincerest condolences. Both families have endured a terrible ordeal, and this is a devastating moment for all of them.\" McManus, a contract worker for the construction company B Stabilini, was kidnapped by gunmen last year. Raiders stormed his apartment in Birnin-Kebbi, in the north-west of the country, and captured him along with Lamolinara. A German colleague managed to escape by scaling a wall but a Nigerian engineer was shot and wounded in the raid. Cameron said that earlier on Thursday he authorised British involvement in the rescue of the two hostages after \"credible information\" was received about their location, but early indications suggested they had been killed before they could be rescued. The prime minister said: \"After months of not knowing where they were being held, we received credible information about their location. A window of opportunity arose to secure their release. \"We also had reason to believe that their lives were under imminent and growing danger. Preparations were made to mount an operation to attempt to rescue Chris and Franco. Together with the Nigerian government, today I authorised it to go ahead, with UK support.\" Cameron added that the Foreign Office had been in contact with McManus's family since his capture in May last year. He spoke to them just before Christmas and has conveyed to them the news of his death. \"I want to take this opportunity to thank the Nigerian authorities, and President [Goodluck] Jonathan personally, for all they have done to help find Chris, and combat terrorism. I also want to pay tribute to all those, including UK personnel, who worked so hard to try to bring Chris home safely. I am very sorry that this ended so tragically. \"I ask that the media respect the family's privacy and allow them time to come to terms with their loss. Terrorism and appalling crimes such as these are a scourge on our world. No one should be in any doubt about our determination to fight and to defeat them.\" The prime minister visited Nigeria in July last year, two months after the men were taken hostage, and met President Jonathan in Lagos. In his statement on Thursday evening he said he had been discussing the matter with the Nigerian authorities since the kidnapping in May. McManus's parents spoke of their devastation at his death. In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, they said: \"Our son Chris was abducted in northern Nigeria on 12 May last year. As a family, we are of course devastated by the news of Chris's death which we received earlier today. During this ordeal we have relied heavily on the support of our family and friends which has never waned and has enabled us to get through the most difficult of times.\" They thanked the British and Nigerian authorities for attempting to launch a rescue mission. \"We are also aware of the many people who were working to try and have Chris returned to our family, and his girlfriend. We would like to thank all of them for their efforts,\" they said. \"We knew Chris was in an extremely dangerous situation. However we knew that everything that could be done was being done.\" McManus's parents paid tribute to his Italian colleague and asked for their privacy to be respected. \"Our thoughts are also of course with the loved ones of Chris's colleague Franco Lamolinara who are also coming to terms with this truly sad news. \"We now need time to grieve and come to terms with our loss. We would therefore be grateful if you would respect our privacy at this most difficult of times.\" There have been a number of foreigners kidnapped while working in Nigeria in recent years. In September 2008 two Britons were held by the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta. A Scottish oil worker was abducted and his guard killed in April 2009, in the Rivers state capital, Port Harcourt. Three Britons and a Colombian were kidnapped in January 2010 and in November of the same year, four men from the US, Canada and France were taken seven and half miles offshore on the Okoro field. In January last year two French hostages were kidnapped from Niamey, the capital of neighbouring Niger, to Nigeria's north. Cameron called the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, to inform him of the \"tragic conclusion\" of the operation, a statement from the Italian government said. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said: \"Our hearts go out to the families of Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara. Their murder is a horrific event. I condemn unreservedly the callous cruelty of their kidnappers and we pay tribute to those who risked their lives in attempting to rescue them.\"",

The captors <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmLq5K5Lpo\" title=\"\">posted a video</a>, featuring the men, which warned that they would be killed.</p> <p>The attempted rescue was mounted by British special forces in an intelligence-led operation planned in close co-operation with the Nigerian authorities, well-placed Whitehall sources said.</p> <p>A unit of the Special Boat Service (SBS) tried to free the men \"after a window of opportunity presented itself\", said an official familiar with the incident.</p> <p>\"The operation was based on good intelligence \u2013 the location was right,\" a source added. The SBS team was told to go in when it appeared that Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara were in imminent danger.</p> <p>\"That was the imperative which drove the operation,\" the Whitehall sources said. They described the men's captors as among the \"nastiest al-Qaida-affiliated terrorists there are\".</p> <p>Officials said the operation was planned in advance in the knowledge that the rescuers had to move quickly when intelligence pointed to an opportunity to free the men. But it was clear any attempt to free them was going to be risky.</p> <p>Units of the SBS and the Special Air Service \u2013 the SAS \u2013 are specifically trained to undertake counter-terrorist operations.</p> <p>The men may have been held in Sokoto, a city in Nigeria's north-west, according to Associated Press.</p> <p>There were reports of a house being surrounded by military forces and the sounds of gunfire being heard before an ambulance was called. Security forces had also set up a cordon around the site.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387103582\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/8/1331231269849/Christopher-McManus-the-B-007.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher McManus, the British hostage killed in Nigeria\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher McManus, the British hostage killed in Nigeria. The photograph has been chosen by the family for use by the media.  Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A Nigerian group, know as \"al-Qaida in the land beyond the Sahil\", claimed in December that it had captured McManus. The group released a video to Nouakchott News Agency showing a blindfolded and bearded man in an orange vest. Three men in dark clothing stood behind him armed with rifles and a machete.</p> <p>The hostage pictured in the video reportedly asked the British government to respond to the demands of the group in order to spare his life. He also asked for people in Britain to pressure the government to answer the demands of the group so he could return to his family.</p> <p>In a statement, Cameron said: \"Our immediate thoughts must be with Chris and Franco's families, and we offer them our sincerest condolences. Both families have endured a terrible ordeal, and this is a devastating moment for all of them.\"</p> <p>McManus, a contract worker for the construction company B Stabilini, was kidnapped by gunmen last year. Raiders stormed his apartment in Birnin-Kebbi, in the north-west of the country, and captured him along with Lamolinara. A German colleague managed to escape by scaling a wall but a Nigerian engineer was shot and wounded in the raid.</p> <p>Cameron said that earlier on Thursday he authorised British involvement in the rescue of the two hostages after \"credible information\" was received about their location, but early indications suggested they had been killed before they could be rescued.</p> <p>The prime minister said: \"After months of not knowing where they were being held, we received credible information about their location. A window of opportunity arose to secure their release.</p> <p>\"We also had reason to believe that their lives were under imminent and growing danger. Preparations were made to mount an operation to attempt to rescue Chris and Franco.

      "bodyText": "Google's privacy policy is too vague for users to control how their information is shared, according to Britain's data protection boss. In his first public comments since Google's revised policy came into effect on 1 March, deputy information commissioner and data protection head David Smith said he was concerned that information was now being shared between some 60 Google services, including mail, calendar, Android phone call logs and search histories. \"Google's privacy policy is too vague,\" said Smith. \"The requirement under the UK Data Protection Act is for a company to tell people what it actually intends to do with their data, not just what it might do at some unspecified point in future. \"Being vague does not help in giving users effective control about how their information is shared. It's their information at the end of the day.\" Last week the French watchdog CNIL, acting on behalf of Europe's national regulators, asked Google not to introduce its new policy on the grounds that it breached data protection laws. The company pressed ahead regardless, saying that after publicising the change for a month that a reversal would confuse consumers. For the first time Google plans to share data amassed by separate services, but the company, which controls 80% of European searches, 30% of European smartphones and 40% of online video globally, has not spelt out in detail what will be shared and with whom. One of the examples given is that if other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, Google may show them your publicly visible Google profile information, such as your name and photo. CNIL warns that Google will be able to display ads on YouTube that relate to a user's recent search activity or data collected from an Android phone. Advertising could in future be tailored to the location of meetings logged in a user's Google calendar service. The company says this is not currently happening and users will be warned of changes. Google said: \"The most important product-specific privacy explanations have been incorporated into our main privacy policy. And there are lots of ways to communicate more about our product-specific privacy practices without creating formal privacy notices. \"For example, we use our privacy centre, help centre articles, in-product notifications, published FAQs and our good to know website to explain what information we collect and how we use it.\" Smith said that he wanted to see search engines like Google included in European legislation being drawn up to give consumers a \"right to be forgotten\" by the internet. The \"Facebook fired\" phenomenon has seen a wave of employees lose their jobs because of information revealed about them in social media. \"Google can't just say: I'm just a messenger, I have no responsibility at all for the messages I carry,\" he said. \"Given their dominant role and their huge influence here they have a responsibility to ensure they operate in a fair and reasonable way. \"Where things are drawn to their attention and it can be established they are delivering content which is defamatory, where it is harmful to individuals and there is no public interest justification Google have a responsibility not to serve up that information.\" The law for now protects Google from prosecution over defamation. The high court recently ruled that the company could not be sued for allowing damaging comments about a Conservative councillor, Payam Tamiz, to be published on its Blogger.com service. The CNIL will report its preliminary findings on whether Google's privacy policy breaches the law at the end of March, and national regulators have vowed to take co-ordinated action. Smith said depending on the findings, the information commissioner could order Google to stop sharing information \"in a way which hasn't been properly explained\" or which people had not consented to. The commissioner's sanctions include fines and criminal prosecutions. \"We have to keep these massive tech giants in check,\" said Georgina Nelson, a lawyer for the consumer group Which?. \"People need to be reassured that they are dealing with their data in the right ways.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March. The original said that \"According to Google, Android's servers collect and store phone call logs with numbers dialled and the time, date and duration of calls.\" This is not the case, and has been corrected",

      "bodyText": "The Team Sky juggernaut is rolling on two fronts, with the world road race champion, Mark Cavendish, completing his fourth sprint win of the season in stage two of the Tirreno-Adriatico race in the Tuscan town of Indicatore, while Bradley Wiggins retained the lead at the Paris-Nice \"Race to the Sun\" in southern France after the toughest hilltop finish of the eight-day event. Tirreno-Adriatico is the principal warm-up race for the opening one-day Classic of the season, Milan-San Remo on 17 March, and Indicatore seemed aptly named as in Tirreno followers watch avidly for signs of form. Cavendish has made no secret of the fact that he wants to win \"La Primavera\" while wearing the rainbow jersey of world champion and his victory ahead of fellow fast men Tyler Farrar and the Spaniard Oscar Freire suggests that he is coming to the boil at the right time. At the end of the 230km stage, it was Farrar's Garmin-Barracuda team that led the peloton \u2013 much reduced in number after a serious crash with two kilometres to go \u2013 into the town, with the American seemingly set fair in the finish straight after he was given the perfect lead-out by his team-mate Robbie Hunter. But Cavendish, ably guided by the Norwegian Edvald Boasson-Hagen, was lurking in their slipstream. Apart from the odd occasion such as the Redon stage of last year's Tour de France, Farrar never quite seems to have the legs to match Cavendish, and this finish was no exception, with the Manxman emerging to claim victory while Freire made a late surge to claim second place. The Spaniard is a near-veteran at 36, but he too will be in the running for San Remo, where he has won three times. The race lead remains with the Australian Matt Goss. Meanwhile, Wiggins faces a tense three-day run-in to the Paris-Nice finish on the C\u00f4te d'Azur, with three other riders within 18 seconds. Wiggins held off all his main rivals on the two-mile climb of the C\u00f4te de la Croix Neuve at Mende, but a new contender emerged from left field, the Dutchman Lieuwe Westra, who won the stage with a perfectly timed attack and is now six seconds behind Wiggins. The American Levi Leipheimer slipped to third, 10 seconds back, with Alejandro Valverde of Spain closing to 18 seconds behind. Westra went clear of a lead group of some 10 riders with only about 600 metres to race, just before the brutal gradient eased slightly for the final run to the line. At that point, Wiggins looked to have the finish sewn up. His Australian team-mate Richie Porte had set a searing pace from the moment the road reared upwards after leaving the final houses of Mende behind, and that was enough to restrain most of the lead group. The Londoner believes that the race is now likely to stay together until Sunday's final time trial, but with such small time gaps there will be no margin for error.",

      "bodyText": "In 60 years of public appearances, the Queen's itineraries have always been meticulously planned to subtly impart the desired message. So her decision to launch her diamond jubilee tour in Leicester today surely conveyed the wish to spotlight the multicultural Britain that has evolved since she acceded to the throne in 1952. Sikh dhol drummers, a Zimbabwean women's choir, the Kibworth brass band, Chinese dancers and a Hindu Holi festival dance number were all part of the mix as the monarch, Prince Philip and the Duchess of Cambridge visited what is set to become Britain's first plural city, where no ethnic group will form a majority, by 2019. In another sign of changing times, the royal party swapped the royal train for a scheduled service \u2013 first-class seats on the 10.15 from St Pancras \u2013 for the day trip, though they did fly back by helicopter. Thousands turned out, supplied with some 10,000 union flags by the city council, to showcase Leicester's patriotism. This is something of a golden period for the city, with news of local crooner Engelbert Humperdinck's planned assault on Eurovision, and the excitement was palpable. Outside De Montfort University, a short walkabout by the royals prompted a Mexican wave of digital cameras and cameraphones as a 4,000-strong crowd \u2013 many of them students \u2013 strained to capture the moment. \"Everyone is so excited and screaming loudly,\" Rozita Kiralova, a student, said. Inside, the Queen, 85, in cerise cashmere, and the 30-year-old duchess, in a teal LK Bennett suit, watched a fashion show of designs by graduates. \"I've been to a fashion show before,\" Kate told the university chancellor, Lord Waheed Alli, the multimillionaire media entrepreneur and chairman of the fashion website Asos. \"I told her, I know, I saw it on the news this morning,\" said Alli, later, referring to the photograph of the student duchess in the see-through slip dress in which she first, apparently, caught Prince William's eye on a catwalk at St Andrews University a decade ago. Shoes were something of a theme to the day. The Queen got to look at a pair of old boots, made in 1895 by a Leicester cobbler and given to a previous royal, Princess May of Teck, later Queen Mary. The duchess will get a handmade pair designed for her, which she chose from six designs submitted by students at the university. \"Overwhelmed,\" gasped a near-tearful Becka Hunt, 20, whose royal blue, suede-embroidered, four-inch heels won. Meanwhile, Prince Philip, 90, was observing robot wars in another part of the campus. For the duchess, there at Buckingham Palace's suggestion, it was another chance to watch a pro at work, and throughout the day she seemed happily relaxed chatting away to Her Majesty. The four-hour visit included royal staples: a multi-faith cathedral service, plaque unveilings, gathering posies from small children. The impressively-titled Queen's Supplier of Nosegays, Leicester florist Rosemary Mason, had provided flowers for the occasion. There was lunch for the great and good at St Martin's House, where guests were served local lamb, prepared by chefs at the city's Maiyango restaurant. It was selected by royal testers from a sample menu and the Queen's preference was for \"medium to well done, with no blood\", chef Phil Sharpe revealed ahead of the visit. The others, he confided to the local paper, would get it \"a bit pinker\". Jubilee business has been brisk, with Fenwick of Leicester on its third order of \u00a35.25 diamond jubilee tea towels, while cake cases and stands at a gift shop bore images of the Queen's face. It was the first of 20 such UK awaydays to be conducted by the Queen, Britain's oldest and second longest-reigning monarch. The campaign group Republic staged a small protest in the city as part of a programme of planned protests to \"question and challenge the record of our head of state\", its chief executive, Graham Smith, said. Failure by the BBC to feature the protest in its coverage prompted the group to accuse the corporation of \"suppressing republican views\" and to announce a protest outside its London HQ. The main focus of the jubilee celebrations will be over the weekend of 2-5 June, which will see a flotilla of 1,000 vessels on the Thames in London and an open-air concert at Buckingham Palace. So far, 3,500 applications for street parties have been made to councils.",

On Wednesday night Lionel Messi brought them together \u2013 two epochs, two congregations, five brilliant goals. Five more. Two hundred and twenty-eight in all. The hand as an icon of a game played with the feet: from 1986 and the symbol of Diego Maradona, Argentina's greatest talent in a generation, in any generation, to the almost mystical symbol of FC Barcelona's greatest nights. A manita, a goal for every finger: the 5-0 against Real Madrid with Johan Cruyff the player in 1974; the 5-0 against Madrid with Johan Cruyff the manager of the Dream Team in 1994; the 5-0 with Leo Messi leading the Team That's Better Than The Dream Team in 2010. On Wednesday in the 7-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen, Messi invoked them both with a Little Hand of his own \u2013 each digit worthy of El Diego. The parallel was unavoidable on both sides of Spain's great footballing divide and beyond. \"The little hand of God,\" declared the cover of Marca, while El Mundo Deportivo removed the diminutive to shout simply: \"The Hand of God.\" Messi has made the extraordinary so routine that his brilliance often goes overlooked. But just when you think he can no longer surprise you, he does. \"This was,\" said Santi Gim\u00e9nez in the sports newspaper AS, \"like Chamberlain getting 100 points in a game, Ali knocking out Liston, Beamon flying in Mexico.\" Messi did not beat anyone else; he beat himself, he broke the limits. Again. He found something he hadn't yet done and did it: there have been two fours and 14 hat-tricks but this was the first time he had scored five in a match. It was the first time that anyone had in the Champions League and it left Messi on 12 goals in this year's competition \u2013 seven ahead of his nearest rival. If he finishes as top scorer it will be the fourth consecutive season. His fifth goal on Wednesday night was his 47th of the season and he is on 49 European goals, as many as Alfredo di St\u00e9fano. He is just seven away from C\u00e9sar, FC Barcelona's highest ever scorer. And here's the real killer stat: he is only 24. Besides, these were not just five goals, they were five wonderful goals; goals that prompted Wayne Rooney to describe him as the \"best player ever\" and Radamel Falcao to ask: \"Sorry, was that a Champions League game or Messi playing on the PlayStation?\" He has scored every kind of goal imaginable: earlier this season he even nodded one over the goalkeeper having first controlled the ball with his head, like some kind of performing seal. And it is not just the goals, it is that he can do everything. \"Show me a player as complete as him,\" Pep Guardiola once said. You can't. On Wednesday night, the Bayer Leverkusen coach, Robin Dutt, said: \"whoever plays football knows that there are no words for Messi. He is a category all of his own: the best player in the world, another galaxy.\" \"One day I will be able to say I coached Messi,\" smiled Guardiola. There is not much you can add; the superlatives ran out years ago. Swearing worked for a while. No more. How do you come up with something that has not been said before? A new language? A symbol? Only one symbol resists him: the Hand of God. And that one may not for much longer. The day that Maradona turned up at Barcelona he walked into the dressing room and saw that the socks had been left rolled into a ball; three hundred kick-ups later his new team-mates' jaws were on the floor; Messi's first day in the dressing room was marked by nerves. On the pitch, though, the comparisons are inevitable and Messi is starting to win the battle. One of those 228 goals was a carbon copy of Maradona's second against England; there is a handball too. And trophy after trophy. More trophies than Maradona won. There is no World Cup yet, sure, but there was no World Cup at this stage of Maradona's career either \u2013 he was 26 when Argentina won it \u2013 and, uncomfortable though it may feel, it could be argued that the pinnacle of world football is the Champions League now. It is a pinnacle Messi climbs over and over. \"You could have put Maradona in with Cameroon, Spain or Nigeria and he would have won the 1986 World Cup,\" says Maradona's Barcelona team-mate Marcos Alonso, hinting at two things that evade Messi \u2013 the World Cup and the ability to carry a team alone. But, Alonso adds: \"Diego did things I had never seen anybody do. Now you see things from Messi that are very, very Maradona.\" The coach of that Argentina team in '86, Carlos Bilardo, says: \"Messi defies the laws of anatomy, he must have an extra bone in his ankle.\" \"Messi is better than Maradona and Pel\u00e9,\" says the Argentinian coach, Carlos Bianchi. \"Every week he shows that he is capable of things that no one had done until now.\" Pablo Aimar, one of that long line of \"New Maradonas\" that could not compete with the old one until Messi turned up and could, says: \"for years I thought that there would never be a player like Maradona. But now Messi is at his level.\" Even in Brazil, Messi has supporters. \"Messi is better than Maradona; he is more complete, more consistent, more spectacular,\" says Tost\u00e3o. \"He is reinventing the game \u2013 a mix of the real and the virtual.\" Whatever they say they will not do Messi justice. \"Don't write about him, don't try to describe him,\" Guardiola once said. \"Watch him.\" It is good advice.",

      "bodyText": "International Women's Day was marked amid a mood of anger that the struggle for equality is far from being won. In Istanbul, the Ukrainian women's rights activists, Femen, staged a topless demonstration in bruise-like makeup to protest against domestic violence hours after a man in the Turkish capital shot dead a female relative because she left home following an argument with her husband. In Cairo, hundreds of women marched for equal rights and a gender balance in Egyptian politics. In France, Nicolas Sarkozy visited female workers at a bra factory whose jobs had been under threat, Carla Bruni was due to appear on a TV current affairs show to discuss women's rights and the Socialist frontrunner in the presidential race, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, promised feminist activists he would put equal numbers of women in government and improve equality. France suffers from a 25% average male-female pay gap. In Spain, there was controversy over plans by the conservative PP government to strike out the abortion-on-demand law passed by the previous Socialist administration. Justice minister Alberto Ruiz-Gallard\u00f3n who has pledged to change the law, claimed many Spanish women saw their \"right to be a mother violated\" by social pressure. \"We don't need protectors, saviours or spiritual fathers to tell us what is good or bad for us,\" said Socialist spokeswoman Elena Valenciano. A recent study showed Spanish women earn 22% less on average than their male peers. Brazil's first female president, Dilma Rousseff, announced tougher measures against men responsible for domestic abuse. One report claimed that 10 Brazilian women met violent deaths each day. She is reported to be close to approving a law fining companies that pay female employees less than men. Palestinian human rights groups and activists drew attention to the three-week hunger strike of Hana Shalabi who has been held in an Israeli prison without charge since being arrested on 16 February. Shalabi, 29, claims she was forcibly strip-searched and assaulted by a male Israeli soldier, beaten and blindfolded. Her six-month sentence of \"administrative detention\" has since been reduced to four months, but she says she will refuse food until freed. Shalabi, who was released from an earlier period of administrative detention last October, is one of seven Palestinian women currently held in Israeli jails. Israeli troops fired teargas at a woman's protest march over her detention in the West Bank. About 500 women also marched in Gaza. Not even International Women's Day, normally a maudlin holiday devoted to flowers and chocolates, was safe from the newly politicised atmosphere in Russia, coming just days after Vladimir Putin's win in the presidential election. Dozens of activists spent the day picketing police headquarters in Moscow, calling for the release of two members of the feminist punk collective Pussy Riot. Maria Alyokhin and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were arrested on the eve of the election for a raucous performance inside Moscow's main cathedral and could face up to seven years in jail on charges of hooliganism. The two women, both mothers of young children, have started a hunger strike. In Afghanistan, analysts and activists have been preoccupied by a statement issued last week by the country's council of top clerics, suggesting the implementation of guidelines for women that hark back to Taliban-era restrictions, such as strict segregation of all work and education and a ban on travelling without a male guardian. It heightens worries that, as the west prepares to leave and the government seeks to negotiate some kind of peace deal with insurgents, women's rights will become a bargaining chip. Women across south-east Asia faced disappointing news. While Thailand and the Philippines tied as holding the highest number of women in senior management positions (at 39%, they rank second in the world behind Russia), the number of women in senior positions across south-east Asia decreased from an average 36% in 2009 to 32% in 2012, according to the latest research from business group Grant Thornton. In Singapore, domestic workers \u2013 who number 206,000 and hail mostly from the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India\u2013 celebrated a parliamentary proposal announced Monday to legislate a weekly day off for workers starting 1 January 2013, after a 10-year-long campaign calling for fairer work rights. \"This is a victory for us,\" said 41-year-old Filipina worker Sandi Gusmao, who has lived and worked in Singapore for the past 20 years. \"Finally we have made history.\" But Indonesian women were smarting from an announcement that the government aims to ban female MPs from wearing miniskirts, as \"provocative clothing will make [men] do things\", according to house of representatives speaker Marzuki Alie.",

      "bodyText": "The Financial Services Authority has fined the former finance director of Royal Liver Assurance \u00a3109,000 for abusing his position, including forging the signature of its chief executive to make millions of pounds worth of unauthorised payments. The City watchdog said George McGregor's transgressions were so severe that it would have handed down a \u00a31m penalty had he been able to pay it. But it decided to slash the fine to little more than a tenth of the original amount partly because he co-operated fully, and because it thought any more would cause him \"serious financial hardship\". McGregor, 52, who was sacked by the mutual insurer in April 2010 after an internal audit discovered he had made unauthorised payments on behalf of the company the year before, was also banned from working in the financial industry ever again. An FSA spokesman explained that the fine was reduced to a level that McGregor was able to pay without going bankrupt. The \u00a31m penalty was also cut by 30% because he agreed to settle at an early stage. The spokesman added, however, that the original size of the fine indicated the seriousness of McGregor's transgressions and would serve as a benchmark if there was a similar case in future. Merseyside police launched its own investigation into McGregor's actions but decided not to bring a criminal case. McGregor was fined for making unauthorised contracts which benefited a former RLA employee. Between May and November 2009 he agreed contracts on behalf of the mutual insurer, whose history in Liverpool goes back more than 160 years, with two companies that were controlled by his former colleague. The FSA said McGregor was negotiating his former colleague's bonus but thought that the amount he had agreed with the individual would not be approved by RLA's board. He therefore sought to conceal the level of bonus by entering into the two contracts to pay substantial sums to the former employee's companies. \"McGregor abused his position in RLA,\" the watchdog said. \"He withheld this information from RLA and circumvented systems and controls for approving contracts which he himself had been instrumental in implementing.\" McGregor also forged the signature of RLA's chief executive to process payments relating to these contracts. This resulted in the insurer paying at least \u00a33.6m to the two companies and incurring a possible contractual liability of up to \u00a318m. Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \"McGregor abused his position of responsibility and engaged in a dishonest, deliberate and sustained course of misconduct. McGregor failed to act with integrity and is not a fit and proper person to work in the financial services industry. Those who take on the responsibility of being an approved person should be in no doubt about our commitment to take the strongest action to tackle behaviour which falls below the high standards we expect.\" RLA was founded in 1850 as the Liverpool Lyver Burial Society, which would fund funerals and save families from financial ruin when the main breadwinner died. It was taken over by the Royal London Mutual Insurance Society, the UK's largest mutual life and pensions company, last July. McGregor joined RLA as internal audit manager from Skipton Building Society in 1994. He moved up the chain to become chief internal audit manager three years later, before being promoted to finance director.",

The \u00a31m penalty was also cut by 30% because he agreed to settle at an early stage.</p> <p>The spokesman added, however, that the original size of the fine indicated the seriousness of McGregor's transgressions and would serve as a benchmark if there was a similar case in future.</p> <p>Merseyside police launched its own investigation into McGregor's actions but decided not to bring a criminal case.</p> <p>McGregor was fined for making unauthorised contracts which benefited a former RLA employee. Between May and November 2009 he agreed contracts on behalf of the mutual insurer, whose history in Liverpool goes back more than 160 years, with two companies that were controlled by his former colleague.</p> <p>The FSA said McGregor was negotiating his former colleague's bonus but thought that the amount he had agreed with the individual would not be approved by RLA's board. He therefore sought to conceal the level of bonus by entering into the two contracts to pay substantial sums to the former employee's companies.</p> <p>\"McGregor abused his position in RLA,\" the watchdog said. \"He withheld this information from RLA and circumvented systems and controls for approving contracts which he himself had been instrumental in implementing.\"</p> <p>McGregor also forged the signature of RLA's chief executive to process payments relating to these contracts. This resulted in the insurer paying at least \u00a33.6m to the two companies and incurring a possible contractual liability of up to \u00a318m.</p> <p>Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \"McGregor abused his position of responsibility and engaged in a dishonest, deliberate and sustained course of misconduct. McGregor failed to act with integrity and is not a fit and proper person to work in the financial services industry. Those who take on the responsibility of being an approved person should be in no doubt about our commitment to take the strongest action to tackle behaviour which falls below the high standards we expect.\"</p> <p>RLA was founded in 1850 as the Liverpool Lyver Burial Society, which would fund funerals and save families from financial ruin when the main breadwinner died. It was taken over by the Royal London Mutual Insurance Society, the UK's largest mutual life and pensions company, last July.</p> <p>McGregor joined RLA as internal audit manager from Skipton Building Society in 1994. He moved up the chain to become chief internal audit manager three years later, before being promoted to finance director.</p>",

The company's chief executive, Dalton Philips, said the giant \"big box\" hypermarkets that underpinned much of the success of the market leader, Tesco, during the last decade were \"soulless sheds\" that would turn out to be a \"blip in the pages of retail history\" as Britons increasingly logged on to buy clothing and homeware. \"The way customers shop is changing,\" he said. \"General merchandise is migrating online, away from the high street and from 'big box' supermarkets. In the future, general merchandise will not be big box but delivered in a cardboard box.\" Morrisons has set out plans to open 70 convenience outlets over the next two years as it makes a late entry into the convenience food retail market, which is growing at twice the rate of the wider market and now accounts for \u00a31 in every \u00a35 spent on groceries. It will also pump money into Kiddicare, the baby goods internet retailer it acquired last year, and the Morrisons website itself as it sets the stage to start selling non-food online at the end of this year. Philips said there was no guarantee that Morrisons would launch a full-blown internet grocery service, despite last year's purchase of a stake in the US online grocer FreshDirect. \"We do not believe any retailer in the UK has achieved the right balance of service to customers and profitable returns for shareholders,\" he said, arguing that a lossmaking website was effectively subsidised by the customers who drove to a retailer's shops. Morrisons is behind the curve in new business channels such as the internet because its former boss and founder, Sir Ken Morrison, shunned anything other than its traditional 38,000sq ft supermarkets and dismissed home delivery as something he had done \"on a bike as a young man\". Hypermarkets such as Tesco Extra stores typically run to 100,000sq ft, and Morrisons \u2013 the smallest member of the big four behind Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's \u2013 says 6.6m UK households are not in easy reach of a store. It has set aside \u00a3700m to open 25 stores this year. The supermarket chain was reporting a better than expected 8% rise in annual profits to \u00a3935m on sales of \u00a317.7bn in the year to 29 January. Analysts were divided on its performance, with the Oriel analyst Jonathan Pritchard frustrated that Philips did not announce more convenience store openings or refurbishments. He said: \"Whilst in certain ways management's conservatism is to be applauded, it could be about to miss a major growth opportunity with its inertia on convenience. \"The sector is going to be a tough place to be in 2012 and industry sales and profits momentum is profoundly negative. Arguably Morrisons is the most exposed as it has few alternative routes to market, barring plain vanilla mid-sized supermarkets.\" Morrisons has been testing so called \"fresh labs\" in its supermarkets for the past 12 months, with a dozen stores remodelled to incorporate much larger fresh produce displays as well as seafood counters and one-offs such as a sushi bar or patisserie. It said another 36 of its 475 supermarkets were to be given the overhauls which cost \u00a31.7m. Morrisons remained circumspect about the general economic outlook, with Philips saying: \"We are seeing 2012 like 2011 \u2013 tough. I don't see the recovery coming any time soon.\"",

The UK seat on the Strasbourg court will become vacant in November when Sir Nicolas Bratza retires. The Ministry of Justice refused to release the candidates' names. But I understand that they are Racquel Agnello QC, Ben Emmerson QC and Paul J Mahoney. Emmerson, 48, is seen as the clear front-runner though the election is in the hands of a 30-person sub-committee of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. Emmerson's most recent high-profile appearance was as counsel for Julian Assange in the court of appeal last year. Though Assange lost, Emmerson persuaded the appeal judges that his client should have an opportunity to take his case to the supreme court, where it is now under consideration. Last December, Emmerson was elected by the UN general assembly to the panel of judges who will consider outstanding war crimes cases relating to Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. In June 2011, he was elected by the UN Human Rights Council as UN special rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights. He has previously acted as special adviser to the international criminal court and the UN-backed Khymer Rouge Tribunal in Cambodia. He has 15 years' experience arguing cases before the European court of human rights. A founder-member of Matrix Chambers, Emmerson sits as a part-time judge in the high court and the crown court. Agnello, 48, also sits as a part-time judge in the high court, where she deals with bankruptcy and company work. Fluent in French and Portuguese, she took a degree in French judicial studies at the university of Strasbourg. However, she has no special expertise in human rights work. Her chambers at 11 Stone Buildings list her practice as corporate and personal insolvency; company and commercial litigation; banking and finance; and shareholder disputes. Mahoney, 65, worked for the Council of Europe, which runs the human rights court, for more than 30 years. He was the court's registrar - its senior staff lawyer - from 2001 to 2005. The barrister served as first president of the EU court of justice's civil service tribunal until last October. Though Mahoney has huge experience as an administrator at the Strasbourg court, he would not be able to serve as a judge there for the full term of nine years. Under article 23 of the human rights convention, judges must retire at the age of 70.",

      "bodyText": "The International News Safety Institute has published the first book dedicated to the safety of women journalists, \"No Woman's Land \u2013 On the Frontlines with Female Reporters\", to coincide with International Women's Day. The brutal attack on Lara Logan in Cairo's Tahrir Square last February was the genesis for the book, which features the experiences of 40 contributors from more than a dozen countries. At INSI, we were inundated with requests for advice and safety tips for women working in dangerous situations. At the time, there was no single point of reference for this, but as we worked to create one, we realised there could be no \"one size fits all\" approach to the debate about the safety of women journalists covering conflict, disaster, civil unrest, corruption and terror. And a year later, that is still the case. Just a few days after \"No Woman's Land\" went to print, the news of Marie Colvin's death provided a terrible reminder that danger often doesn't discriminate on the basis of gender. But sometimes, like in Logan's case, there are special and additional risks for women. Describing her ordeal at the hands of \"300 baying men\", she writes: \"I want everyone to know I was not simply attacked \u2013 I was sexually assaulted. This was, from the very first moment, about me as a woman. But ultimately, I was just a tool.\" The lengths some of the women have gone to and the personal risks they have taken to tell their audiences the truth are extraordinary. Somali investigative journalist, Fatuma Noor, describes the immense cultural and personal challenges she faces: \"Coming from a very conservative community, it has not been easy [to work as a female journalist] \u2013 not only because of the community, but also because some family members have always had problems with my career. \"I have covered the Somali community in Kenya and Somalia, where it is culturally wrong for a woman to ask men questions and to travel without having your husband or family around.\" And yet, she goes on to describe how she went undercover into a Somali brothel in Nairobi and how another occasion, she was kidnapped as she travelled with a group of Islamic insurgents from Nairobi to Somalia. Fellow contributor Shumaila Jaffrey explains how \"being a woman journalist in Pakistan is in itself a great achievement\". Recalling her coverage of the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir, she writes: \"I still remember in one of the areas, a local mosque's Imam issued a fatwa that men of faith should not marry women who had been working in quake hit areas.\" For those women reporting far from home, some of the greatest challenges have been adapting to different cultures. The book provides tips from the contributors about how to better blend in to foreign cultures, which often includes wearing the right clothing \u2013 something that was repeatedly mentioned by those who covered last year's Arab spring uprisings. Sometimes it's not about blending in, when being a woman opens doors to parts of society and to a different angle on war and disaster. The BBC's Caroline Wyatt writes: \"We were welcomed into homes which no foreign male correspondent was allowed into, and we were privileged to hear and film the stories of women of the north in a way none of our male colleagues could. \"And perhaps we brought a different perspective to the war: a little less focus on the bombs and bullets, and more on what the end of the Taliban's rule in the north would mean for the families we met, and for their future.\" Her BBC colleague Lyse Doucet believes that in many places she works western women are treated as a \"third gender\". \"We aren't treated like the women of the place. We aren't treated like the men. But in traditional societies, where hospitality trumps ideology, we are almost always accorded the special privileges afforded to guests. In conservative societies, that also includes a belief that women need to be protected.\" Doucet talks about many Egyptian men who helped escort her through rowdy crowds in Tahrir Square last November. The same place. But a very different outcome from that experienced by Logan a few months earlier, who writes: \"This was about something bigger than all of us \u2013 it was about what we do as journalists. That ancient tactic of terrifying people into submission or silence. \"I do not believe it should stop or deter women from doing this kind of work. Or travelling to such places.\" It's a passage that lies at the heart of the book, a passionate testimony to the bravery of the women who have contributed and to their female colleagues, and evidence of the dangers they face in their work.

But ultimately, I was just a tool.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The lengths some of the women have gone to and the personal risks they have taken to tell their audiences the truth are extraordinary.</p> <p>Somali investigative journalist, Fatuma Noor, describes the immense cultural and personal challenges she faces:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Coming from a very conservative community, it has not been easy [to work as a female journalist] \u2013 not only because of the community, but also because some family members have always had problems with my career.<br> \"I have covered the Somali community in Kenya and Somalia, where it is culturally wrong for a woman to ask men questions and to travel without having your husband or family around.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And yet, she goes on to describe how she went undercover into a Somali brothel in Nairobi and how another occasion, she was kidnapped as she travelled with a group of Islamic insurgents from Nairobi to Somalia.</p> <p>Fellow contributor Shumaila Jaffrey explains how \"being a woman journalist in Pakistan is in itself a great achievement\". Recalling her coverage of the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir, she writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I still remember in one of the areas, a local mosque's Imam issued a fatwa that men of faith should not marry women who had been working in quake hit areas.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>For those women reporting far from home, some of the greatest challenges have been adapting to different cultures. The book provides tips from the contributors about how to better blend in to foreign cultures, which often includes wearing the right clothing \u2013 something that was repeatedly mentioned by those who covered last year's Arab spring uprisings.</p> <p>Sometimes it's not about blending in, when being a woman opens doors to parts of society and to a different angle on war and disaster. The BBC's Caroline Wyatt writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We were welcomed into homes which no foreign male correspondent was allowed into, and we were privileged to hear and film the stories of women of the north in a way none of our male colleagues could.</p> <p>\"And perhaps we brought a different perspective to the war: a little less focus on the bombs and bullets, and more on what the end of the Taliban's rule in the north would mean for the families we met, and for their future.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Her BBC colleague Lyse Doucet believes that in many places she works western women are treated as a \"third gender\".</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We aren't treated like the women of the place. We aren't treated like the men. But in traditional societies, where hospitality trumps ideology, we are almost always accorded the special privileges afforded to guests. In conservative societies, that also includes a belief that women need to be protected.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Doucet talks about many Egyptian men who helped escort her through rowdy crowds in Tahrir Square last November.</p> <p>The same place. But a very different outcome from that experienced by Logan a few months earlier, who writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This was about something bigger than all of us \u2013 it was about what we do as journalists. That ancient tactic of terrifying people into submission or silence.<br> \"I do not believe it should stop or deter women from doing this kind of work. Or travelling to such places.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's a passage that lies at the heart of the book, a passionate testimony to the bravery of the women who have contributed and to their female colleagues, and evidence of the dangers they face in their work.</p> <p><strong><em>Hannah Storm is deputy director of INSI and co-editor of \"No Woman's Land - On the Frontlines with Female Reporters\", which is available to buy at <a href=\"http://www.newssafety.org/\">www.newssafety.org</a>, with proceeds going to safety training for female journalists</em></strong></p>",

The names of the three senior lawyers have been sent by the Ministry of Justice to Strasbourg where the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe will shortly choose a replacement for Sir Nicholas Bratza, president of the ECtHR, who retires at the end of October. The names on the shortlist are: the civil liberties barrister Ben Emmerson QC, Raquel Agnello QC, a commercial litigation specialist, and Paul Mahoney, a former registrar at the ECtHR. The post, which was advertised last year, carries a salary of around \u00a3160,000 a year. Emmerson, 48, is the most widely known of the three. A founding member of Matrix Chambers, he is already the British judge on the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda and the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Last year he was he was elected by the United Nations Human Rights Council as UN special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights. He is due to report soon on the use of targeted killings and drone attacks in state counter-terrorism strategies. Emmerson has appeared both for and against the United Kingdom in cases at Strasbourg. His recent clients have included the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, Mohammad Amir, the Pakistani fast bowler who pleaded guilty to match-fixing and Marina Litvinenko, widow of the assassinated dissident former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko. Agnello, who became a QC in 2009, has specialised in corporate insolvency and company litigation. She has appeared for the Pensions Regulator and is fluent in French and Portuguese. She also sits in the high court part time as a deputy registrar in bankruptcy. Paul Mahoney, who practiced briefly as a barrister in the 1970s and lectured in law at University College, London, has spent most of his professional career in Europe. He has worked at the ECtHR, where he was registrar between 2001 and 2005 and subsequently at the European Union civil service tribunal. None of the candidates contacted by The Guardian wished to comment. The advert for the job specified that \"judges must be of high moral character and either possess the qualifications required for appointment to high judicial office or be juriconsults ... of recognised competence\". It also required a \"commitment to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights\". The parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg, however, said it had not yet received the shortlist.

      "bodyText": "Pakistani authorities have charged the three wives of Osama bin Laden with illegally entering and living in the country, as an independent investigation into the al-Qaida leader's final days found that his eldest wife was suspected by the other two of betraying him. The three wives have been in custody since they were left behind last May when a US raiding party found and killed Bin Laden in the northern town of Abbottabad. They had been expected to be freed but it was announced by the interior minister on Thursday that they would be charged with immigration offences. The news came as an independent investigation by a retired Pakistani brigadier, Shaukat Qadir, claimed that Bin Laden was living in effective retirement in Abbottabad and may even have been senile. Qadir is known to be close to Pakistan's current army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, who arranged several visits for him to the Abbottabad compound, which has been cordoned off by security forces since the US operation. The Abbottabad house was suddenly demolished, without explanation, by the Pakistani authorities late last month. Using transcripts of the interrogation of Bin Laden's wives and interviews with Pakistani intelligence officials, Qadir pieced together the most comprehensive account yet of the al-Qaida leader's life after he fled the Tora Bora mountains of Afghanistan in late 2001. According to Qadir, Bin Laden may have had a kidney transplant back in 2002, which would explain why his known kidney ailment did not require him to undergo dialysis treatment while on the run. There were 27 people, including bodyguards and members of Bin Laden's extended family living in the house when the al-Qaida leader was killed. They had all got on well until the arrival of Khairiah Sabar in early 2011, Qadir said. \"When Khairiah came, everybody else was very suspicious of her. They didn't trust her at all,\" Qadir told the Guardian. \"I am also of the view that actually the person who sold him [Bin Laden] out was Khairiah, not the fictitious courier who the US keeps talking about being al-Kuwaiti.\" \"Everything begins to happen with her arrival. Until then, the Americans seem to know nothing.\" Qadir's account is at odds with the leaked US official story, which contends that they found the Abbottabad house when they followed an al-Qaida \"courier\" known as al-Kuwaiti to the home, some time in the second half of 2011. Khairiah, a Saudi who Bin Laden married in 1985 as the third of his six wives, was freed from Iranian custody in 2010 as part of a murky exchange for an Iranian diplomat who had been kidnapped by extremists in Pakistan. Aged around 62, she made her way without her children to Abbottabad on Bin Laden's instructions. The other two wives, Siham, a Saudi aged around 54, who had three adult children with her, and Amal, a Yemeni aged around 31, who had five young children, had lived with Bin Laden since he moved into the Abbottabad home in mid-2005. They had also been with him for periods at other hiding places in Pakistan after 2001. \"Bin Laden didn't sleep with any of his other wives after marrying Amal,\" said Qadir. At one point, when pressed by Siham's adult son Khalid about why she had come, Khairiah said it was because she had \"one final duty\" to perform for Bin Laden. It seems that even Bin Laden feared that she would turn him in, and he \"kept telling\" the other two wives to leave, but they refused, Qadir said. Despite being apparently cured of kidney failure, Bin Laden was suffering from a degenerative disease, which caused premature senility, Qadir said. As a result, al-Qaida's \"shura\", or leadership council, sent him into early retirement around 2003 in Pakistan. Others think that Bin Laden stayed active, as the organisation's spiritual guide and may have been involved in planning details of al-Qaida attacks in the west. But Qadir's theory could explain images that emerged on video tapes found at the Abbottabad house, in which Bin Laden is seen sitting on the floor watching television with childlike fascination. The Qadir investigation places Bin Laden in South Waziristan, in the tribal area close to the Afghan border, in the early years after 2001. He later travelled back into Afghanistan and then, in 2004, he made his way into northern Pakistan, to the Swat area. Following that, after a few months further south in Haripur district, he eventually moved into the purpose-built Abbottabad home in May 2005. The Bin Laden wives have never been involved with al-Qaida. Last year, Pakistan's official commission investigating the al-Qaida leader's presence in the country recommended that the wives and children be sent home. It is not known what has now made Pakistan charge them with the relatively trivial issue of not having a visa, though it was thought that the Saudi authorities, who wield enormous influence in Islamabad, were not keen to take back their citizens. The wives and children are being held at a house somewhere undisclosed in Islamabad. Rehman Malik, Pakistan's interior minister, said the home would now function as a sub-jail. \"They are being kept in a proper legal manner,\" said Malik.",

The Abbottabad house was suddenly demolished, without explanation, by the Pakistani authorities late last month.</p> <p>Using transcripts of the interrogation of Bin Laden's wives and interviews with Pakistani intelligence officials, Qadir pieced together the most comprehensive account yet of the al-Qaida leader's life after he fled the Tora Bora mountains of Afghanistan in late 2001. According to Qadir, Bin Laden may have had a kidney transplant back in 2002, which would explain why his known kidney ailment did not require him to undergo dialysis treatment while on the run.</p> <p>There were 27 people, including bodyguards and members of Bin Laden's extended family living in the house when the al-Qaida leader was killed. They had all got on well until the arrival of Khairiah Sabar in early 2011, Qadir said.</p> <p>\"When Khairiah came, everybody else was very suspicious of her. They didn't trust her at all,\" Qadir told the Guardian. \"I am also of the view that actually the person who sold him [Bin Laden] out was Khairiah, not the fictitious courier who the US keeps talking about being al-Kuwaiti.\"</p> <p>\"Everything begins to happen with her arrival. Until then, the Americans seem to know nothing.\"</p> <p>Qadir's account is at odds with the leaked US official story, which contends that they found the Abbottabad house when they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/how-osama-bin-laden-found\" title=\"\">followed an al-Qaida \"courier\" known as al-Kuwaiti to the home</a>, some time in the second half of 2011.</p> <p>Khairiah, a Saudi who Bin Laden married in 1985 as the third of his six wives, was freed from Iranian custody in 2010 as part of a murky exchange for an Iranian diplomat who had been kidnapped by extremists in Pakistan.</p> <p>Aged around 62, she made her way without her children to Abbottabad on Bin Laden's instructions. The other two wives, Siham, a Saudi aged around 54, who had three adult children with her, and Amal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/12/bin-laden-wife-martyr-family\" title=\"\">a Yemeni aged around 31, who had five young children</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/06/osama-bin-laden-family-compound\" title=\"\">had lived with Bin Laden since he moved into the Abbottabad home in mid-2005</a>. They had also been with him for periods at other hiding places in Pakistan after 2001.</p> <p>\"Bin Laden didn't sleep with any of his other wives after marrying Amal,\" said Qadir.</p> <p>At one point, when pressed by Siham's adult son Khalid about why she had come, Khairiah said it was because she had \"one final duty\" to perform for Bin Laden. It seems that even Bin Laden feared that she would turn him in, and he \"kept telling\" the other two wives to leave, but they refused, Qadir said.</p> <p>Despite being apparently cured of kidney failure, Bin Laden was suffering from a degenerative disease, which caused premature senility, Qadir said. As a result, al-Qaida's \"shura\", or leadership council, sent him into early retirement around 2003 in Pakistan.</p> <p>Others think that Bin Laden stayed active, as the organisation's spiritual guide and may have been involved in planning details of al-Qaida attacks in the west. But Qadir's theory could explain images that emerged on video tapes found at the Abbottabad house, in which Bin Laden is seen sitting on the floor watching television with childlike fascination.</p> <p>The Qadir investigation places Bin Laden in South Waziristan, in the tribal area close to the Afghan border, in the early years after 2001. He later travelled back into Afghanistan and then, in 2004, he made his way into northern Pakistan, to the Swat area. Following that, after a few months further south in Haripur district, he eventually moved into the purpose-built Abbottabad home in May 2005.</p> <p>The Bin Laden wives have never been involved with al-Qaida. Last year, Pakistan's official commission investigating the al-Qaida leader's presence in the country <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/osama-bin-laden-wives-free\" title=\"\">recommended that the wives and children be sent home</a>.</p> <p>It is not known what has now made Pakistan charge them with the relatively trivial issue of not having a visa, though it was thought that the Saudi authorities, who wield enormous influence in Islamabad, were not keen to take back their citizens.</p> <p>The wives and children are being held at a house somewhere undisclosed in Islamabad. Rehman Malik, Pakistan's interior minister, said the home would now function as a sub-jail.</p> <p>\"They are being kept in a proper legal manner,\" said Malik.</p>",

Kauto Star, the most popular steeplechaser in training, will gallop around the course after racing alongside his stable companion Mon Parrain, on what could yet turn out to be his last appearance on a track as a thoroughbred in training. The much-awaited decision on whether Kauto Star is sufficiently recovered from a training mishap two weeks ago to contest the Gold Cup at Cheltenham next Friday will be delayed until Monday, 24 hours before the Festival opens on 13 March. Friday's gallop, though, will form an essential part of the thought process as Paul Nicholls and Clive Smith, his trainer and owner respectively, assess Kauto Star's recovery from a heavy fall while schooling. Nicholls said that he is \"looking forward\" to today's gallop, while Smith suggested that Kauto Star is \"nearly there\" in the struggle to reach full race fitness in time for the Gold Cup. \"I'm feeling pretty good about it, he's been progressing very well this week and we're very happy with the way that he's come on,\" Smith said. \"He seems to be more back to his normal self, he's had a load of physio all the time and he's been on the horse-walker and working on the hill with Big Buck's. \"I think the gallop will give him a change of air and a change of scenery, and if there were any doubts about what he was thinking in his mind, it might not do him any harm to see a racecourse. \"He's going to do about two miles, and have a good gallop and then school on the grass on Monday. There will be plenty of people about at Wincanton, so it will do no harm as a warm-up for Cheltenham. He might as well have a day when he sees lots of people and it might freshen him up a bit.\" If Kauto Star were to win a third Gold Cup on 16 March, it would be a moment to rank with the victories of Dawn Run and Desert Orchid in the same race in the memory of anyone fortunate enough to see it. To simply reach the start next Friday, though, Kauto Star will need to satisfy his connections that he can do himself justice in a race that is always run at a fierce pace, over one of the most demanding courses in the country. \"Other people might have different ideas about things, but I have to be sure that he is really right,\" Smith said. \"I can only tell by people telling me, and so there's the vet, and there's Paul's advice, and Clifford [Baker, Nicholls's head lad and Kauto Star's regular work rider] to tell me how good he is, but if there are any doubts, he won't go.\" Two significant names are now unlikely to run at next week's meeting after Invictus, one of the favourites for the RSA Chase, and Unaccompanied, the second-favourite for the Mares' Hurdle, were both described as doubtful starters by their trainers . Alan King said that Invictus, who took the Reynoldstown Chase at Ascot last time out, \"has a problem and at this stage there has to be a doubt as to whether he would run.\" Unaccompanied, meanwhile, has not suffered a setback, but is likely to be kept fresh for a Flat campaign in the summer. \"She was entered just in case something happened to the favourite [Quevega], she'd have a great chance then,\" Stan Cosgrove, racing manager for Moyglare Stud, Unaccompanied's owners, said. \"We'll probably keep her on the Flat for this year and she'll be a great mare to breed from when she retires.\"",

      "bodyText": "Households with children will be \u00a310 a week worse off next year as Britain's poorest families bear the brunt of George Osborne's austerity programme, the UK's leading experts on tax and spending said on Thursday. Fuelling the political row over the impact of the government's deficit-reduction plan, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said a third year of falling real incomes \u2013 unmatched since the 1970s \u2013 would hit the least well-off hardest. The thinktank said the poorest 20% of households would see their incomes fall by around 1.5% in 2012-13, adding that the coalition could not meet its targets for cutting child poverty. Families with children would, on average, be \u00a3530 worse off next year. \"The largest average losses from the 2012\u201313 reforms as a percentage of income will be among those in the bottom half of the income distribution. Households with children are set to lose the most from the reforms, and pensioner households are the one major demographic group who will gain from them, on average\", the IFS said. According to the IFS study, the median household will be \u00a3160 worse off next year as a result of the chancellor's changes. Living standards will fall by 0.6% following a 6.4% drop in the previous two years. The thinktank said that inflation-adjusted incomes would not start to rise until 2014-15 and would be lower in 2015-16 than in 2002-03. It was, said the IFS, an \"unprecedented period of no growth in average living standards since records began in 1961. Had the historical average growth rate continued over those 13 years, real median income would have grown by 22% over the period.\" Over the coming year, poorer families would be affected by the decision to uprate benefits in line with the consumer prices index rather than the retail prices index (which tends to show a higher annual inflation rate), by the freezes to child benefit and working tax credits, and from the time limiting of employment and support allowance. The Treasury said higher tax allowances and the freezing of council tax would help soften the blow of the deficit-reduction programme, but the IFS said these would not benefit the least well-off households, who did not earn enough to pay tax and were receiving council tax benefit. It added that the official 2020 target for cutting to below 10% the number of children living in households with incomes of less than 60% of the national median had always been \"ambitious\" but said the trend was now up rather than down, \"making it inconceivable under current policies that the targets could be achieved (or even got close to).\" The government, said the IFS, should either publish a credible plan for hitting its child poverty target or set different goals that it had a chance of achieving. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"This is a damning analysis of the choices this out of touch government has made as they raise taxes and cut spending too far and too fast. \"How can we be all in this together when the banks have got a tax cut this year, while people on low and middle incomes are being hit hard and families with children hardest of all?\" A Treasury spokesman said: \"There is nothing fair about running huge budget deficits and burdening future generations with debts we cannot afford to pay. If the deficit is not tackled now, the impact on families will be worse in the long term with less money to deliver the public services that they rely on. This has meant tough decisions, but made in the fairest way, taking real action to benefit families in all aspects of their lives.'' He added that the government had doubled its free childcare for two-year-olds, and announced an increase in the child tax credit of up to \u00a3135 per child. \"When it is introduced, the universal credit will give nearly 3 million households a higher level of entitlement and enable more parents to get into work by helping 80,000 families with childcare support.\"",

      "bodyText": "Plans for smart ticketing for rail passengers across the UK and the prospect of even higher fares at peak times were unveiled by the government as it looks to save billions of pounds by radically altering the way the rail system is run. Justine Greening, transport secretary, confirmed on Thursday that she wanted the industry to deliver savings of \u00a33.5bn a year by 2019. Greening said passengers and taxpayers were picking up the tab for the \"costly efficiency gap\" and that reform was long overdue. She said deeper collaboration between Network Rail's track managers and the train-operating companies could cut costs. Greening wants smart ticketing along the lines of London's Oyster card to be extended to other parts of the country. She also announced a consultation on fares that could mean season tickets for part-time workers and \"21st-century working practices\". It could allow operators to sell airline-style ticketing, with prices rising according to demand, and new \"shoulder\" fares to smooth the large gaps between peak and off-peak prices. She proposed selling tickets at corner shops and in surviving local libraries to suit passengers' needs \u2013 an idea condemned by unions, which claim 675 smaller railway booking offices are under threat. While Greening insisted that reform and costcutting should mean commuters eventually pay less overall, passenger groups warned that allowing premium peak-time fares risked derailing any fares review. Sophie Allain, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said that they welcomed discount fares and more smart and integrated ticketing but added: \"All of this will be overshadowed if operators are allowed to charge premium fares on busiest services.\" Fares are already set to rise well above inflation next year and Allain said YouGov polling, which the campaign had commissioned, showed only 14% of people believed raising prices faster on busier trains was fair. Managing rush-hour demand through higher peak fares could delay the need for longer trains, the Department for Transport believes. The DfT's rail command paper was a response to Sir Roy McNulty's 2011 rail value-for-money study, which said UK railways were among Europe's most costly and the industry could save 20% to 30% by changing working practices. Current central subsidies to the rail industry run at about \u00a33bn-\u00a34bn a year, excluding expenditure on big infrastructure projects such as Crossrail and the \u00a333bn minimum earmarked for HS2, the high-speed rail tracks linking London with the north. McNulty cited high wages as a problem, and proposed fewer staff on trains and closing hundreds of smaller booking offices. The DfT said it would award longer franchises to train operators to encourage investment, and welcomed moves by Network Rail to hand over more powers to its regional route directors. Yet Thursday's command paper was short on specifics of where the billions will be saved, with Greening saying that the detail of how cuts can be achieved would be left to the industry's own bosses to decide via the Rail Delivery Group. However, the DfT indicated that they should seek to implement more driver-only trains and stated that future franchises would be awarded to companies with a strong record of driving down costs. Greening denied this would mean job losses overall, pointing to investment that would mean more skilled employment in the sector in years to come. Unions have warned that concessions allowing train-operating companies to run both trains and track would suck more taxpayers' money into private profits. Bob Crow, RMT general secretary, called the plans \"a recipe for exploitation\" and warned that jobs were at risk, adding: \"The assault on jobs and working conditions set up by McNulty, and now mirrored by the government, will be met by a national campaign of resistance.\" The Campaign for Better Transport has warned that super-peak fares would not be effective in managing peak demand, as many commuters have inflexible work times or family commitments. Their research suggested higher peak fares would have only a marginal impact on travel patterns. The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, said the restructuring plans were \"deeply worrying\" and left \"a massive accountability gap at its heart\". She said it would create an even more fragmented system with more costs and more opportunity for train operators to raise fares and close services. Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said that the proof of government intent would come in how franchises were awarded over the next two years: \"The government must genuinely step back from the detail, [and] give the railways the freedom to run better services at a lower cost,\" he said. Responding to Bob Crow, he said reducing costs was crucial to deliver services at a price people can pay. \"This is not about yesterday's ways of driving trains or manning ticket offices. If it's not affordable none of us are going to have jobs on the railways. There are working practices that can be modernised. That doesn't necessarily mean making people redundant.\" Greening also announced a consultation on devolving power over the network, an opportunity welcomed by regional transport authorities, which would like to emulate the kind of integrated model of Transport for London.",

      "body": "<p>Plans for smart ticketing for rail passengers across the UK and the prospect of even higher fares at peak times were unveiled by the government as it looks to save billions of pounds by radically altering the way the rail system is run.</p> <p>Justine Greening, transport secretary, confirmed on Thursday that she wanted the industry to deliver savings of \u00a33.5bn a year by 2019. Greening said passengers and taxpayers were picking up the tab for the \"costly efficiency gap\" and that reform was long overdue.</p> <p>She said deeper collaboration between Network Rail's track managers and the train-operating companies could cut costs.</p> <p>Greening wants smart ticketing along the lines of London's Oyster card to be extended to other parts of the country. She also announced a consultation on fares that could mean season tickets for part-time workers and \"21st-century working practices\". It could allow operators to sell airline-style ticketing, with prices rising according to demand, and new \"shoulder\" fares to smooth the large gaps between peak and off-peak prices.</p> <p>She proposed selling tickets at corner shops and in surviving local libraries to suit passengers' needs \u2013 an idea condemned by unions, which claim 675 smaller railway booking offices are under threat.</p> <p>While Greening insisted that reform and costcutting should mean commuters eventually pay less overall, passenger groups warned that allowing premium peak-time fares risked derailing any fares review.</p> <p>Sophie Allain, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said that they welcomed discount fares and more smart and integrated ticketing but added: \"All of this will be overshadowed if operators are allowed to charge premium fares on busiest services.\" Fares are already set to rise well above inflation next year and Allain said YouGov polling, which the campaign had commissioned, showed only 14% of people believed raising prices faster on busier trains was fair.</p> <p>Managing rush-hour demand through higher peak fares could delay the need for longer trains, the Department for Transport believes.</p> <p>The DfT's rail command paper was a response to Sir Roy McNulty's 2011 rail value-for-money study, which said UK railways were among Europe's most costly and the industry could save 20% to 30% by changing working practices.</p> <p>Current central subsidies to the rail industry run at about \u00a33bn-\u00a34bn a year, excluding expenditure on big infrastructure projects such as Crossrail and the \u00a333bn minimum earmarked for HS2, the high-speed rail tracks linking London with the north.</p> <p>McNulty cited high wages as a problem, and proposed fewer staff on trains and closing hundreds of smaller booking offices.</p> <p>The DfT said it would award longer franchises to train operators to encourage investment, and welcomed moves by Network Rail to hand over more powers to its regional route directors. Yet Thursday's command paper was short on specifics of where the billions will be saved, with Greening saying that the detail of how cuts can be achieved would be left to the industry's own bosses to decide via the Rail Delivery Group.</p> <p>However, the DfT indicated that they should seek to implement more driver-only trains and stated that future franchises would be awarded to companies with a strong record of driving down costs. Greening denied this would mean job losses overall, pointing to investment that would mean more skilled employment in the sector in years to come.</p> <p>Unions have warned that concessions allowing train-operating companies to run both trains and track would suck more taxpayers' money into private profits.</p> <p>Bob Crow, RMT general secretary, called the plans \"a recipe for exploitation\" and warned that jobs were at risk, adding: \"The assault on jobs and working conditions set up by McNulty, and now mirrored by the government, will be met by a national campaign of resistance.\"</p> <p>The Campaign for Better Transport has warned that super-peak fares would not be effective in managing peak demand, as many commuters have inflexible work times or family commitments.

      "bodyText": "Adults aged 45 and over are more than three times as likely to drink alcohol almost every day than those under 45. Campaigners believe that is a sign that the middle aged are ignoring the serious health risks associated with excessive drinking. The age disparity is most pronounced among women. Those aged 65 and over are 12 times more likely than those aged between 16 and 24 to drink on a near-daily basis. The 2010 General Lifestyle Survey, which was completed by more than 13,000 people across Britain, covers topics including drinking, smoking and general health. Its findings also showed that people aged between 45 and 64 typically consume more alcohol per week than any other age group. The age problem is reversed for binge drinking, with younger people far more likely than their older counterparts to consume large amounts of alcohol in one go. Sixteen per cent of men aged 16 to 24 reported consuming more than 12 units on at least one day, while this figure was just 2% among those aged over 65. Again the disparity is more pronounced among women. Only 1% of over-65s drank more than nine units in one day, compared with 12% for the 16-24 group. The Department of Health recommends that men should not regularly drink more than three or four units a day, with women advised to stick to two to three units. Variances between socio-economic groups are also apparent, with those in managerial and professional roles tending to drink more than those in intermediate or routine employment. This trend is particularly clear among women, where two-thirds in managerial or professional positions drink alcohol in a typical week, compared to 44% in routine and manual jobs. Eric Appleby, the chief executive of Alcohol Concern, said this was \"the hidden truth about alcohol and Middle England\". \"Many over-45s drink daily, and those from professional or managerial households drink more, especially women\", he added. \"Whilst drinking is decreasing amongst younger age groups, the middle-aged middle classes are taking unnoticed risks with their health, increasing their likelihood of suffering illnesses such as liver disease, stroke and cancer.\" His concerns were echoed by Chris Sorek, the chief executive of Drinkaware, who drew attention to the health risks older people are imposing upon themselves by drinking regularly. \"Despite frequent images in the news of young adults sprawled on pavements after a night out on the town, today's research confirms Drinkaware's evidence that 25 to 44-year-old working professionals are drinking more heavily and more regularly than young adults\", he said. \"Although it can be easy to find excuses to drink after a long day, many people are unaware that they are putting themselves at risk by drinking more than they think. \"Regularly going over the unit guidelines has serious implications for your health, from disturbed sleep and weight gain to cancer, heart and liver disease, which has no warning signs.\"",

      "bodyText": "On 28 November 1975, Francisco Xavier do Amaral of Fretilin, the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor, proclaimed the territory's independence from Portugal. The next day, though the new government made him president of the nascent republic, it did not invite him to its first council of ministers meeting. Yet Amaral, who has died aged 74, was far more than a figurehead. The proclamation was a desperate attempt to head off an invasion by Indonesia, which followed on 7 December. The civilian and military leadership, including Amaral, and most of the population fled to the hills and the jungles, intent on fighting back. Within weeks, Amaral became uneasy with this strategy, and differences widened as the Indonesian bombardment of the civilian population intensified. Amaral later argued that his position had been vindicated. In 1978-79, faced with annihilation, Fretilin told the civilian population to surrender and to continue to work for independence under Indonesian control. This relationship between the clandestine and armed wings of the resistance formed the basis of the non-sectarian \"national unity\" strategy developed in the 1980s by Xanana Gusm\u00e3o. After his arrest in September 1977, Amaral was denounced as a traitor, beaten and burnt by his rivals, confined in a hole in the ground, starved and twice force-marched to new places of detention. Many of his real and putative followers were executed in a purge aimed at stemming the defeatism of which Amaral was accused. In August 1978, he fell into Indonesian hands. For most of the next 22 years, he was kept as a prisoner of the Indonesian general Dading Kalbuadi, for whom he was obliged to tend his horses and orchids, and was trotted out to mouth support for \"integration\". Amaral was born in Turiscai, in the Manufahi district, the eldest son of a local chief. His noble background gave a conservative cast to his politics, but he was strongly nationalist and averse to the effects of colonial neglect. After returning from religious studies in Macau in 1963, he did not become a priest, but a teacher. He then took a job in the customs service and started his own school for Timorese denied a place in one of the few secondary schools. In May 1974, following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, Amaral was asked by Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta and Mari Alkatiri to become president of the pro-independence Timorese Social Democratic Association (ASDT), which that September changed its name to Fretilin. Party politics were a new departure, and Amaral was adept at conveying the unfamiliar ideas involved in a language accessible to ordinary Timorese. After his return to Timor in 2000, Amaral revived the ASDT label and formed his own party, standing for the presidency in 2002 and 2007. Support in presidential and parliamentary elections ran at about 15% of the national vote. This was enough to give Amaral considerable leverage, and the two dominant forces, Fretilin and Gusm\u00e3o, standing as an independent, vied for his support. The Fretilin government made him deputy speaker of parliament when it came to power in 2002. Gusm\u00e3o, elected as the first president, pressed Fretilin for the full rehabilitation of Amaral and other purge victims. Having defeated an opposition resolution in 2003 to recognise Amaral as the \"proclaimer\" of Timorese independence, on the eve of the 2007 election Fretilin decided that he deserved the title after all. In 2007, ASDT became part of the AMP (Alliance of the Parliamentary Majority) governing coalition and Amaral was appointed to the council of state. The following year, he headed a list of 15 leading figures of the liberation struggle honoured by the government. Declining health may have been one reason why these efforts to woo him met with limited success (and why he found it difficult to manage the conflict-riven ASDT), but his even-handed criticism of executive privilege and corruption also reflected his often expressed preference for a politics \"that would start at the grassroots and go up\". In 1974 Amaral married Lucia Osorio Soares, whose brothers were prominent members of the pro-Indonesian party Apodeti, but the two soon separated. \u2022 Francisco Xavier do Amaral, politician, born 1937; died 6 March 2012",

After returning from religious studies in Macau in 1963, he did not become a priest, but a teacher. He then took a&#xa0;job in the customs service and started his own school for Timorese denied a place in one of the few secondary schools.</p> <p>In May 1974, following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, Amaral was asked by Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta and Mari Alkatiri to become president of the pro-independence Timorese Social Democratic Association (ASDT), which that September changed its name to Fretilin. Party politics were a new departure, and Amaral was adept at conveying the unfamiliar ideas involved in a language accessible to ordinary Timorese.</p> <p>After his return to Timor in 2000, Amaral revived the ASDT label and formed his own party, standing for the presidency in 2002 and 2007. Support in presidential and parliamentary elections ran at about 15% of the national vote.</p> <p>This was enough to give Amaral considerable leverage, and the two dominant forces, Fretilin and Gusm\u00e3o, standing as an independent, vied for his support. The Fretilin government made him deputy speaker of parliament when it came to power in 2002. Gusm\u00e3o, elected as the first president, pressed Fretilin for the full rehabilitation of Amaral and other purge victims. Having defeated an opposition resolution in 2003 to recognise Amaral as the \"proclaimer\" of Timorese independence, on the eve of the 2007 election Fretilin decided that he deserved the title after all.</p> <p>In 2007, ASDT became part of the AMP (Alliance of the Parliamentary Majority) governing coalition and Amaral was appointed to the council of state. The following year, he headed a list of 15 leading figures of the liberation struggle honoured by the government. Declining health may have been one reason why these efforts to woo him met with limited success (and why he found it difficult to manage the conflict-riven ASDT), but his even-handed criticism of executive privilege and corruption also reflected his often expressed preference for a politics \"that would start at the grassroots and go up\".</p> <p>In 1974 Amaral married Lucia Osorio Soares, whose brothers were prominent members of the pro-Indonesian party Apodeti, but the two soon separated.</p> <p>\u2022 Francisco Xavier do Amaral, politician, born 1937; died 6 March 2012</p>",

      "bodyText": "A proclamation issued by the Rump Parliament offering a reward of \u00a31,000 for the capture of the \"traitor\" Charles Stuart has been sold for more than \u00a333,000 at an auction in Shropshire. The \"wanted\" poster dates to 1651, the year the 21-year-old prince had made a desperate attempt to regain the English throne for the Stuart dynasty, following the trial and execution of his father Charles I. The attempt was promptly dashed. On 3 September, Charles's Royalist army was crushed by the Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army at Worcester. With his forces routed, Charles fled the battlefield, evading capture at one stage by hiding in the \"Royal Oak\" (as it later came to be known) at Boscobel, Shropshire. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles's dramatic escape from Worcester was presented as clear evidence of God's providential care for the young king. Until 1859 \"Oak Apple Day\" (29 May) was kept as a public holiday celebrating the nation's \"redemption from tyranny and the king's return to his government\". But how significant was Charles II's escape from Worcester in ensuring the future of the monarchy? If history had turned out differently, rather than celebrating the Queen's diamond jubilee in 2012, could have been preparing to elect their next president? The auctioneer Richard Westwood-Brookes has suggested that had Charles been captured, \"it is most unlikely we would ever have returned to being a monarchy\". It is certainly very likely that had he been captured, Charles Stuart would have been killed. Even before the execution of Charles I, the New Model Army had made it clear in its Remonstrance of November 1648 that it regarded the king's eldest sons, Charles and James, as complicit in their father's war crimes. But Charles II's death probably would not have had much impact on whether England remained a republic. For one thing there was still a healthy stock of alternative royal heirs available. Charles I may have been a pretty useless monarch in most respects, but hefulfilled the royal role of fathering legitimate successors with aplomb. With his wife, Henrietta Maria, the king had five children who reached adulthood (three sons \u2013 Charles, James and Henry \u2013and two daughters, Mary and Henrietta Anne). In any case, the strength or weakness of the royalist cause really had very little to do with the Restoration in 1660. Royalist alliances with first the Irish and then the Scots had been brutally suppressed by Cromwell's forces. Royalist conspiracy in England too was an abysmal failure, the New Model Army crushing rebellions in 1655 and 1659. Indeed, few land armies of the mid-17th century could have provided a serious military challenge to the republic's military might. Ultimately, it was neither a groundswell of royalist sentiment nor the efforts of the Stuart dynasty itself that made Charles II king in 1660. The irony is that monarchy was restored as a consequence of the strength rather than the weakness of English republicanism: the revival of both English republicanism and religious radicalism in the wake of the downfall of Richard Cromwell's protectorate in 1659 terrified more conservative parliamentarians such as William Prynne. It was this that led to the critical intervention of General George Monck, a man with enough military force at his disposal to tip the balance of power towards the moderates.Charles II was only too aware that most of those who played a significant role in did so because they saw monarchy not as the ideal form of government, but as the least worst option on the table. As Charles wryly noted when receiving parliament's promises of \"affection and fidelity\": it must then have been \"his own fault he had been absent so long; for he saw no body that did not protest, he had ever wished for his return\".

      "bodyText": "Managers Only one of the fearful five can expect to survive relegation with his reputation pretty much intact. There remains a consensus that, given greater resources, Roberto Mart\u00ednez might achieve wonderful things. The thoughtful Spaniard has not merely defied the odds twice previously to preserve Wigan's Premier League status but has done so courtesy of a boldly purist passing vision laced with integrity and intelligence. Inexperienced he may be but Terry Connor has taken the similarly brave step of asking his Wolves players to move the ball significantly faster than before. The caretaker's strictures worked a treat when drawing at Newcastle recently but subsequently rather unravelled during a 5-0 thrashing by Fulham. Time will tell whether the Molineux board have promoted the new Chris Hughton from their backroom or made a monumental midjudgment. Until this season Owen Coyle had been burnishing his CV so successfully that it appeared only a matter of time until a big club came calling. Now, though, the smooth upward trajectory has plunged into reverse and he coming weeks represent a real litmus test of the Glaswegian's abilities. Where Coyle has learnt to disguise his ego, Steve Kean retains a certain brash arrogance. Yet within the game, Kean is regarded as a gifted coach and, most importantly, he appears to have won the hearts and minds of some important Rovers players. Ewood regulars would much prefer to have Mark Hughes back but, impressive as his record at Blackburn and Fulham ultimately proved, QPR's recently installed manager tends to start slowly in new posts. There is also the question of whether a man who at Fulham demanded a bigger desk and the symmetrical assembly of training ground drinks containers, was spoilt by managing Manchester City. Talented as Hughes has proved in the past, he cannot afford to turn precious now. After joining QPR on the rebound when Sunderland preferred Martin O'Neill, his managerial future is on the line. Fixtures On paper Bolton have by far the easiest-looking run in. Playing mainly safe mid-table opponents their only games involving European contenders are against Newcastle and Tottenham. Even so, three impending six-pointers against QPR, Blackburn and Wolves could shape the club's destiny. QPR's remaining fixtures appear the hardest by some distance. Six games against sides in the top seven conclude with a trip to Manchester City on the final day. As the former City defender Nedum Onuoha says: \"We've got the toughest challenge.\" If Wolves' visit to Wigan on that closing afternoon could be all important, Mart\u00ednez's team must also meet five top-seven teams. Wolves face three and Blackburn four. Form Perhaps bolstered by the memory of defeating Arsenal and Manchester United earlier in the season, Blackburn boast the best current form of this bad lot. While two wins, two draws and three defeats in their past seven Premier League fixtures engenders cautious optimism, QPR have failed to enjoy the traditional \"new manager bounce\" since Hughes replaced Neil Warnock seven league games ago, winning one, drawing two and losing four. Over the same span of matches, Bolton have performed worst \u2013 winning once, drawing once, losing five \u2013 but Wigan and Wolves have collected only a solitary point apiece more, the latter conceding 12 goals in the past three matches. Squads While the January departures of two key central defenders \u2013 Christopher Samba from Blackburn to Anzhi Makhachkala and Bolton's Gary Cahill to Chelsea \u2013 may prove pivotal, the great imponderable centres on which strikers will hit form, hold their nerve and convert vital chances. Right now Blackburn's impressive, experienced, Yakubu Ayegbeni seems the forward most likely to propel Kean's men to safety but Kevin Doyle's recent hints at a renaissance suggest Wolves could have a chance if Terry Connor can coax the Irishman into reprising former glories. David Ngog and Tuncay Sanli have not exactly been prolific for Bolton so Owen Coyle \u2013 badly missing his injured creator Stuart Holden \u2013 must trust the club's ultimate refusal to sell Kevin Davies to Sunderland can make a vital difference. Wigan's Hugo Rodallega is still pining for Charles N'Zogbia \u2013the club's erstwhile creative catalyst who joined Aston Villa last summer \u2013 but the talented Colombia striker, who will leave the DW Stadium on a free transfer this summer, could aid Mart\u00ednez's cause considerably by resolving to catch leading clubs' eyes. QPR, easily the biggest spenders, posess potential attacking aces amid a smattering of household \"names\". Much depends on how quickly Bobby Zamora and Djibril Ciss\u00e9 adapt to life at Loftus Road and on whether Joey Barton, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Adel Taarabt can supply the service they crave. Tellingly, QPR appear undermined by the uncertainty stemming from the deployment of a bewildering total of 34 different players this season \u2013 more than any other Premier League rival and only three short of the record 37 utilised by Middlesbrough in 2005-06. Politics Relegation struggles strain the tightest of bonds and even the ties that bind Wigan's Dave Whelan and Martinez appear in peril of loosening. Indeed Wigan's recent 2-0 home defeat by Swansea prompted the owner to publicly decry the team's \"worst performance in years\" before questioning his manager's use of substitutes. Prolonged talks prefaced reconciliation but Mart\u00ednez may regret not joining Aston Villa when he had the chance last summer. At least he has no need of a bodyguard. Kean's minder is required because Blackburn's fans see the manager as a puppet of Venky's, the club's reviled Indian owners, and they believe that the Scot, having betrayed Sam Allardyce, was only employed because his representatives, SEM, also advise Venky's. Once a month he is forced to travel \u2013 via overnight flight to Mumbai and a four-hour car journey \u2013 to Venky's Pune headquarters to explain his latest actions. After, controversially, sacking Mick McCarthy, Steve Morgan and Jez Moxey, the Wolves owner and chief executive, presided over a farcical hunt for a replacement before, several rejections later, elevating McCarthy's assistant, Connor. Boardroom credibility is at stake. Already \u00a3110m in debt Bolton Wanderers dread the Championship yet the owner Eddie Davies and chairman, Phil Gartside, continue to back Coyle after asking the manager not only to prune the wage bill but hothouse youngsters and adjust the playing style from Allardyce-esque direct to something slightly closer to Barcelona's.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Managers</strong></h2> <p>Only one of the fearful five can expect to survive relegation with his reputation pretty much intact. There remains a consensus that, given greater resources, Roberto Mart\u00ednez might achieve wonderful things. The thoughtful Spaniard has not merely defied the odds twice previously to preserve Wigan's Premier League status but has done so courtesy of a boldly purist passing vision laced with integrity and intelligence.</p> <p>Inexperienced he may be but Terry Connor has taken the similarly brave step of asking his Wolves players to move the ball significantly faster than before. The caretaker's strictures worked a treat when drawing at Newcastle recently but subsequently rather unravelled during a 5-0 thrashing by Fulham. Time will tell whether the Molineux board have promoted the new Chris Hughton from their backroom or made a monumental midjudgment.</p> <p>Until this season Owen Coyle had been burnishing his CV so successfully that it appeared only a matter of time until a big club came calling. Now, though, the smooth upward trajectory has plunged into reverse and he coming weeks represent a real litmus test of the Glaswegian's abilities.</p> <p>Where Coyle has learnt to disguise his ego, Steve Kean retains a certain brash arrogance. Yet within the game, Kean is regarded as a gifted coach and, most importantly, he appears to have won the hearts and minds of some important Rovers players.</p> <p>Ewood regulars would much prefer to have Mark Hughes back but, impressive as his record at Blackburn and Fulham ultimately proved, QPR's recently installed manager tends to start slowly in new posts. There is also the question of whether a man who at Fulham demanded a bigger desk and the symmetrical assembly of training ground drinks containers, was spoilt by managing Manchester City. Talented as Hughes has proved in the past, he cannot afford to turn precious now. After joining QPR on the rebound when Sunderland preferred Martin O'Neill, his managerial future is on the line.</p> <h2><strong>Fixtures</strong></h2> <p>On paper Bolton have by far the easiest-looking run in. Playing mainly safe mid-table opponents their only games involving European contenders are against Newcastle and Tottenham. Even so, three impending six-pointers against QPR, Blackburn and Wolves could shape the club's destiny.</p> <p>QPR's remaining fixtures appear the hardest by some distance. Six games against sides in the top seven conclude with a trip to Manchester City on the final day. As the former City defender Nedum Onuoha says: \"We've got the toughest challenge.\" If Wolves' visit to Wigan on that closing afternoon could be all important, Mart\u00ednez's team must also meet five top-seven teams. Wolves face three and Blackburn four.</p> <h2><strong>Form</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps bolstered by the memory of defeating Arsenal and Manchester United earlier in the season, Blackburn boast the best current form of this bad lot. While two wins, two draws and three defeats in their past seven Premier League fixtures engenders cautious optimism, QPR have failed to enjoy the traditional \"new manager bounce\" since Hughes replaced Neil Warnock seven league games ago, winning one, drawing two and losing four.</p> <p>Over the same span of matches, Bolton have performed worst \u2013 winning once, drawing once, losing five \u2013 but Wigan and Wolves have collected only a solitary point apiece more, the latter conceding 12 goals in the past three matches.</p> <h2><strong>Squads</strong></h2> <p>While the January departures of two key central defenders \u2013 Christopher Samba from Blackburn to Anzhi Makhachkala and Bolton's Gary Cahill to Chelsea \u2013 may prove pivotal, the great imponderable centres on which strikers will hit form, hold their nerve and convert vital chances.

With turnover rising by 69% from \u00a352.4m to \u00a388.4m it represents the club's best financial showing for some time. \"The financial results for the year ending June 2011 are extremely strong,\" said Derek Llambias, Newcastle's managing director. \"We can now count ourselves among the very few clubs across the UK and Europe who are operating at close to break even. What is particularly pleasing is that we have achieved this whilst also ensuring we have a strong squad sitting firmly in the top third of the table and currently pushing for a European place.\" Although Mike Ashley, Newcastle's owner, may not be the most popular man on Tyneside, he is clearly knocking the club into decent financial shape. Wages accounted for 60.6% of turnover but that figure had dropped from 82.7% in 2008-09. Meanwhile the operating loss has fallen from \u00a333.5m in 2009-10 and \u00a337.7m 12 months earlier. Newcastle's latest figures were boosted by the \u00a335m sale of Andy Carroll to Liverpool in January 2011. \"We have dealt wisely in the transfer market,\" said Llambias, who has presided over a policy whereby the club have signed talented players such as Cheik Tiot\u00e9 and Yohan Cabaye for modest fees. Although the club's borrowing from Ashley, in interest-free loans, still stands at \u00a3140m, Newcastle believe their policy of paying transfer fees up front rather than in staggered portions, as well as not including bonuses or image rights in player contracts, is serving them well. Significantly, the board \u2013 who recently reached a settlement with HM Customs and Revenue over outstanding tax liabilities \u2013 have cleared all third-party debts, which amounted to \u00a376m in 2006-07. \"In 2006-07 it was costing \u00a36.5m a year just to finance the club's interest-bearing debt,\" said Llambias. \"We have also worked hard to address an inherited wages-to-turnover ratio which was unsustainable. Wages now account for just over 60% of turnover and we feel this is a healthy and affordable level. \"Mike Ashley continues to provide loans totalling \u00a3140m interest-free, for which we are extraordinarily fortunate.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Piven, best-known as foul-mouthed Hollywood agent Ari Gold in the HBO comedy Entourage, is in talks to take the lead role in ITV's new costume drama Mr Selfridge. ITV confirmed on Thursday that the 46-year-old, who has picked up a Golden Globe and multiple Emmy Awards for Entourage, is in negotiations to take the role of American entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge, who founded the famous London department store. The broadcaster recently hired Oscar-winning US actor Shirley MacLaine for the third series of Downton Abbey, to be transmitted later this year. MacLaine will play Martha Levinson, the mother of Elizabeth McGovern's Lady Grantham. ITV is seeking a high profile US actor to play the lead role in Mr Selfridge, a move that might also serve to help international sales of the ITV Studios production. The broadcaster describes the character of Selfridge as \"Mile a Minute Harry, a man with a mission to make shopping as thrilling as sex\". \"Pioneering and reckless, with an almost manic energy, he created a theatre of retail where any topic or trend that was new, exciting, entertaining \u2013 or sometimes just eccentric \u2013 was showcased,\" the broadcaster added. A spokeswoman for ITV confirmed that the broadcaster was in talks with Piven. \"We are in negotiations but no deal has been finalised,\" she said. ITV chief executive Adam Crozier unveiled plans for the ambitious 10-part drama, which will have a budget comparable to that backing ratings hit Downton Abbey, at ITV's annual results at the end of February. Mr Selfridge, a working title for the drama which will go into production in April, is being written by Andrew Davies. Davies, one of the UK's most prolific TV writers, is well-known for literary adaptions including Pride and Prejudice, Bleak House and Moll Flanders. The ITV drama, set in 1909 London, is based on the book Shopping, Seduction and Mr Selfridge by author Lindy Woodhead. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said that an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is not inevitable. But he claimed it is the threat of military action, not sanctions, that will deter Tehran from developing an atomic bomb. Following his White House meeting with Barack Obama this week, Netanyahu differed with the president over the value of diplomacy and was sceptical about a fresh round of talks between Tehran and the major powers, telling Fox News that Iran has \"bamboozled the west\". The Israeli prime minister said that, like Churchill, he is sounding the \"jarring gong of danger\" to wake democracies from their slumber to the coming danger. Asked if \"war is inevitable\", Netanyahu replied: \"I don't think so\". But he brushed off Obama's demand this week for an end to the \"loose talk of war\" and \"blustering\" over Iran - criticisms evidently aimed at months of threats from within Israel - to argue that Tehran is more likely to respond to fear of attack than sanctions. \"We've seen, in fact, that Iran backed off from its nuclear programme, its nuclear weapons programme, really only once in the 15, 16 years that I've been warning the world about the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran. And the only time they backed away was in 2003, when they thought there'd be a credible military threat against them,\" he said. \"So in fact, the paradox is that if they actually believe that they're going to face the military option, you probably won't need the military option.\" The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, reiterated the military threat on Iran by saying that Washington has been preparing the plans for an attack \"for a long time\". But, in an interview with the National Journal, he marked out the sharp difference with Israel over the timing of any assault by effectively saying that if an attack becomes necessary it would be better to wait and let the US carry it out. \"If (Israel) decided to do it there's no question that it would have an impact, but I think it's also clear that if the United States did it we would have a hell of a bigger impact,\" he said. At their White House meeting this week, Obama sought to persuade Netanyahu to hold off on any attack against Iran with a promise that even if Tehran was able to move its nuclear programme to fortified underground facilities beyond the reach of Israel's military, the US would still be able to destroy them. But that requires Netanyahu to place the decision on whether to attack Iran in Washington's hands, something he has said he will not do. The Israeli premier declined to discuss a possible timeline for Israeli military action but said the Iranians are getting \"very, very close\". He said that increasingly stringent sanctions are taking their toll on Iran, but not where it matters. \"It's hurt their economy. But it has not stopped their (nuclear) programme by one wit,\" he said. While Obama has said the US assessment is that Iran has not yet made the decision to develop a nuclear bomb, Netanyahu repeated his assertion that he has no doubt that is what Tehran intends to do. \"Why do you think Iran is doing all of this - developing these underground halls with thousands of centrifuges to enrich uranium? \u2026 They're building ICBM, intercontinental ballistic missiles, to carry, what? Medical isotopes? That's their explanation? They are absorbing these crippling sanctions,\" he said. \"So I don't think anyone seriously thinks that Iran is doing all of this, going through all of this huge investment, taking huge risks for anything but a nuclear programme, and I think we should recognise that.\" Netanyahu was sceptical a new round of talks agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN security council plus Germany will change very much. The group appealed in a statement on Thursday for Iran to enter into a \"serious dialogue\" on its nuclear programme and said it was \"concerned that, despite efforts made so far, no agreement was reached, including on the access to relevant sites in Iran, requested by the [International Atomic Energy Agency]\". It called for Iran to fulfil an undertaking to grant access to the Parchin military base where IAEA inspectors suspect Tehran has possibly undertaken research into triggers for nuclear weapons. Diplomatic pressure was ratcheted up on Iran over the site with the release of satellite pictures suggesting it was cleaning up the military base to hide evidence of the research. However, the pictures were met with scepticism by some experts. Netanyahu said Tehran has previously used negotiations to \"deceive and delay\" and could do so again. \"The only way you get a result if you got them to agree to freeze their enrichment, take out all the enriched uranium that they have enriched, take it out of Iran, the stuff that can make bombs. If they want to make medical isotopes, you can give them back - uranium that can serve that purpose, a peaceful purpose,\" he said. \"And they can dismantle this underground facility they have in a place called Qom, which is basically an underground nuclear bunker. They could do all of that. Then you would have an indication that the talks have actually produced something. But personally, I'm sceptical. I think they have bamboozled the west. And they think they can get away with it.\" Asked whether the intelligence on Iran might prove to be as flawed as the false reports of weapons of mass destruction in the runup to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Netanyahu said there was \"no comparison\". \"In the case of Iraq, I was on the Israeli cabinet when we discussed this issue. We didn't know. We couldn't say that they didn't have a nuclear weapons programme, we couldn't say if they did. In the case of Iran there is absolutely no question. We share all of that information. We know the stockpiling of enriched uranium. We know the development of ICBMs. We know a lot more. And we share this information. I don't think that's comparable.\" During his visit to Washington this week, Netanyahu persuaded leading members of Congress that Israel is serious about attacking Iran - and that the warnings of military action are not just bluster in order to pressure the west in to ratcheting up sanctions on Tehran. They include Dianne Feinstein, the chair of the Senate intelligence committee, who told CNN that following her meeting with Netanyahu and discussions with other officials she believes Israel is serious about being prepared to attack Iran. \"I followed the intelligence very carefully, I've met with Israeli generals \u2026 with the president, and here's what I believe: I believe that Israel will attack. I believe that it is important that diplomacy be given an opportunity, I believe it is possible to achieve a diplomatic solution,\" she said. Asked about Netanyahu's attitude, Feinstein said: \"His resolve is very firm, no one should doubt that. He told us he's not asking anything of the United States. Israel believes they are prepared to handle it. Now what happens after an attack is very different.\" But the senator said Netanyahu is likely to respond to Obama's appeal to give sanctions time to work. \"I believe the Israelis will wait to see what happens,\" she said.",

      "bodyText": "As a byword for reliability and safety, Toyota conquered the ferociously competitive global car market to become the number one manufacturer in the world. But the Japanese company that once could do no wrong suffered yet another blow to its battered reputation when it said it was recalling 681,500 vehicles in the US due to safety concerns. Toyota has now recalled more than 10m vehicles in the past three years as a litany of technical problems have bedevilled a manufacturer once renowned as a pioneer of production knowhow. It has also seen operations devastated by last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand, where many parts are made. Pummelled by natural disasters, faulty vehicles and the high yen, which makes exports expensive, Toyota warned in December 2011 that profit would be less than half what it was in 2010. Sales have been hit hard, and the firm has lost market share to resurgent US rivals. No longer is Toyota the largest carmaker in the world \u2013 General Motors had grabbed back the title it lost in 2008 after decades of American hegemony, while Germany's Volkswagen has overtaken Toyota in Europe and is winning awards for reliability and design. Colin Couchman, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive, said: \"The latest Toyota recalls are the last thing the company needs, as it undermines claims they have turned a corner and will attract the sort of attention the firm could do without.\" He added: \"Toyota has lost market share in North America, with the Koreans making gains when it comes to smaller vehicles, and GM lifting sales of trucks and SUVs. \"The playing field has evened out in America, with US companies coming up with a lineup so good they don't have to discount as much as they did.\" Instead, the Japanese need to cut prices to claw back what they have lost. This is a relatively new dynamic and \"it's going to be intriguing to see how it plays out,\" he said. The latest recalls, disclosed by Toyota on Thursday, include about 495,000 Tacoma trucks, made between 2005 and 2009, which need to have their steering wheel spiral cable assemblies replaced. Toyota said friction may occur between the assembly's spiral cable and the retainer in some vehicles and, over time, cut the connection to the driver's airbag. In addition, it is recalling about 70,500 Camry sedans made during 2009 and about 116,000 Venza crossovers made between 2009 and 2011 to replace lamp switches. The company said it would notify affected owners when it was obtaining replacement parts, which it would fit for free. It said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries caused by the problems. The company's carefully cultivated image as safe and reliable has taken a beating. The setbacks have dented public confidence and left senior management embarrassed, culminating two years ago in an appearance by then chief executive Akio Toyoda before a US congressional committee, during which he apologised repeatedly for the faults. There were 14 separate recalls involving Toyota vehicles in 2010 alone. In 2010, Toyota was fined $32.4m (\u00a320.9m) by the US government for failing to swiftly recall millions of vehicles with faulty brakes and steering. Those fines were the maximum allowed by law. Toyota paid another $16.4m fine related to the recalls, bringing the total to $48.8m. Another investigation was prompted by the fatal crash of a California highway patrol officer, Mark Saylor, and his family. They died after reporting a stuck accelerator while driving a 2009 Lexus ES 350. Despite its travails, Toyota has returned to normal production and seen a revival in its sales in the US, one of its biggest markets. According to the latest data, Toyota's US sales increased by 12% in February from a year earlier. Analysts said the upward trend was likely to continue in the coming months despite the latest recall. [This update was inserted on 13 March 2012: A Toyota representative adds that \"the US government investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and engineers at the National Aeronautical and Safety Administration into unintended acceleration both concluded that there were no real-world scenarios in which Toyota electronics can cause unintended acceleration and both closed their investigations into this matter in 2011.\"] But one problem that is not going away is the strength of yen, still relatively high against the dollar. A strong yen means a \u2260dip in the value of repatriated profits for big exporters such as Toyota, as well as putting their products at a competitive pricing disadvantage in export markets. \u2022 This article was updated on 13 March 2012 to include information from Toyota about the outcome of US inquiries into the accelerator question.",

      "bodyText": "Who is Joseph Kony? Kony is a former choirboy from northern Uganda who leads a personality cult and militia that he calls the Lord's Resistance Army. He founded the group in the late 1980s, modelling it on the Holy Spirit Movement, led by a similarly charismatic former prostitute, Alice Lakwena, who presented herself as the defender of the Acholi people of northern Uganda, against the government in Kampala of Yoweri Museveni. Lakwena promised her warriors immunity from bullets if they rubbed themselves with shea butter. She was defeated by Museveni's troops in 1988 and fled to Kenya, clearing the path for Kony. He first called his militia the Ugandan People's Democratic Army (UPDA), then the Holy Spirit Mobile Force, and then the LRA. What do Kony and the LRA want? It is difficult to identify any consistent aims. The group started off as an Acholi militia and then adopted Christian rhetoric with a heavy dose of mysticism. But, as support from the Acholi fell away, Kony increasingly victimised civilians who refused to join him. Whatever Christian characteristic the LRA may have had also fell away to be replaced by a personality cult centred on Kony. As the militia has been forced out of Uganda and moved into southern Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, there is has been less emphasis on defeating Museveni. Its aims have narrowed to survival and pillage. What crimes has Kony committed? The first arrest warrants ever issued by the International Criminal Court in The Hague were aimed at Kony and four of his LRA commanders, for crimes against humanity and war crimes. The 2005 indictments include charges of murder, rape, the sexual enslavement of women and girls and forcing children to fight. The Ugandan army has also been accused of using child soldiers, but the LRA's reputation for brutality is unparalleled. When Kony's troops attack a village, they usually kill most of the adult population and abduct the children. They have been accused of forcing boys to kill their parents as an initiation rite. Girl are shared out among the commanders as sex slaves. The LRA has practised mutilation as a tool of terror, cutting off the lips, noses and ears of its victims. Why has the LRA been able to operate for so long? There are several explanations advanced for the Uganda government's failure to deal with the LRA over the past 25 years. The LRA has drawn on some support from the Acholi people, especially as Museveni's army, led by officers from south-west Uganda, was guilty of abuses of its own. The sheer sadism of the LRA terrorised the civilian population and discouraged resistance, while ensuring a steady influx of forced child recruits who were used as cannon fodder on the front line. For two decades, the LRA could rely on the Sudanese government in Khartoum for support and safe haven, in retaliation for Ugandan backing for the southern Sudanese People's Liberation Army. As that supply route was blocked by independence for South Sudan last year and as Ugandan forces have been beefed up by 100 US military advisers with hi-tech support, the LRA has increasingly been forced to melt into the forests of the DRC and CAR.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Who is Joseph Kony?</strong></p> <p>Kony is a former choirboy from northern Uganda who leads a personality cult and militia that he calls the Lord's Resistance Army. He founded the group in the late 1980s, modelling it on the Holy Spirit Movement, led by a similarly charismatic former prostitute, Alice Lakwena, who presented herself as the defender of the Acholi people of northern Uganda, against the government in Kampala of Yoweri Museveni. Lakwena promised her warriors immunity from bullets if they rubbed themselves with shea butter. She was defeated by Museveni's troops in 1988 and fled to Kenya, clearing the path for Kony. He first called his militia the Ugandan People's Democratic Army (UPDA), then the Holy Spirit Mobile Force, and then the LRA.</p> <p><strong>What do Kony and the LRA want?</strong></p> <p>It is difficult to identify any consistent aims. The group started off as an Acholi militia and then adopted Christian rhetoric with a heavy dose of mysticism. But, as support from the Acholi fell away, Kony increasingly victimised civilians who refused to join him. Whatever Christian characteristic the LRA may have had also fell away to be replaced by a personality cult centred on Kony. As the militia has been forced out of Uganda and moved into southern Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, there is has been less emphasis on defeating Museveni. Its aims have narrowed to survival and pillage.</p> <p><strong>What crimes has Kony committed?</strong></p> <p>The first arrest warrants ever issued by the International Criminal Court in The Hague were aimed at Kony and four of his LRA commanders, for crimes against humanity and war crimes. The 2005 indictments include charges of murder, rape, the sexual enslavement of women and girls and forcing children to fight. The Ugandan army has also been accused of using child soldiers, but the LRA's reputation for brutality is unparalleled. When Kony's troops attack a village, they usually kill most of the adult population and abduct the children. They have been accused of forcing boys to kill their parents as an initiation rite. Girl are shared out among the commanders as sex slaves. The LRA has practised mutilation as a tool of terror, cutting off the lips, noses and ears of its victims.</p> <p><strong>Why has the LRA been able to operate for so long?</strong></p> <p>There are several explanations advanced for the Uganda government's failure to deal with the LRA over the past 25 years. The LRA has drawn on some support from the Acholi people, especially as Museveni's army, led by officers from south-west Uganda, was guilty of abuses of its own. The sheer sadism of the LRA terrorised the civilian population and discouraged resistance, while ensuring a steady influx of forced child recruits who were used as cannon fodder on the front line. For two decades, the LRA could rely on the Sudanese government in Khartoum for support and safe haven, in retaliation for Ugandan backing for the southern Sudanese People's Liberation Army. As that supply route was blocked by independence for South Sudan last year and as Ugandan forces have been beefed up by 100 US military advisers with hi-tech support, the LRA has increasingly been forced to melt into the forests of the DRC and CAR.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Q: What is the new iPad called? Is it iPad 3, iPad HD, iPad RD (retina display), or what? A: Just \"iPad\". It's \"the new iPad\". It doesn't have a generational name. Once something gets to a third generation - as here - Apple doesn't seem to bother with names. Except of course it does with the iPhone. Q: What's different or new in the physical object? A: A \"retina display\", LTE/4G networking capability, a battery with much more capacity (the screen and LTE systems are both power-hungry), a new chip (the \"A5X\"), 5 megapixel back camera, Bluetooth 4.0, 1080p video recording and stabilisation. Q: What's happened to the iPad 2? A: That carries on - with a price drop, from \u00a3399 to \u00a3329 (\u00a3429 for the 3G model) but only available in the low-end 16GB capacity. Q: What's new in the software on the iPad? A: \u2022 Voice dictation - which is Siri-lite, so the voice-to-text without the action; \u2022 face detection in still pictures; \u2022 iPhoto, an iOS version of its desktop app, but where you can now manipulate images directly; \u2022 some tweaks and improvements to Garageband (\"smart strings\" - you can be the string section - and multiple recording across more than one iPad); \u2022 improvements to iMovie (costing \u00a32.99) which let you cut film footage directly into \"trailers\" - because, as one of the demonstrators pointed out, these days nobody is going to cut a film of five minutes of shaky camera with Dad on the beach. (Note the image stabilisation too - and expect that in the next iPhone iteration.) Apple also released a software update, iOS 5.1, on Wednesday night, which has various bugfixes and improvements, mainly to the iPhone, though it also lets you delete photos from iCloud's feed - a much-requested feature. Q: What is the retina display like close up - and what does retina display mean, anyway? A: Even close up, it's virtually impossible to see individual pixels. The point of the \"retina display\" is that at arm's length you absolutely cannot see them, so that you have an effect that's the same as print: your eye isn't distracted by the subconscious realisation that you're seeing something composed of individual lit pixels. This is going to have significant effects on peoples' ability to read text on iPads. Here's why: the idea of the super-pixel-dense display is something that Jakob Nielsen of Nielsen/Norman Group has been predicting for absolutely ages; getting screens to a pixel density where it can fool the eye should, in theory, mean that you can read as fast there as on paper. (On standard resolution, including the Kindle, you read only about half as fast as on paper.) (Update: that may be an overestimation: this 2001 paper suggests the difference is that reading on paper is \"significantly - 10%-30% faster than reading on screen.\" There doesn't seem to be a great deal of research more recently into this topic.) Once a display starts having the same effective resolution as paper, you should be able to read more quickly. There are problems with the fact that the iPad screen uses transmitted rather than reflected light - that will slow down reading a little - but it should be noticeable. For pictures and other display objects, the improved resolution is - from our limited experience - a bit like the change from standard TV to HDTV. You notice the change as a dramatic leap at first, then get used to it. It's on going back that you notice what's missing. Q: Does anyone else have a retina display? A: Asus's newest Transformer tablet may qualify - judging by the specifications that were announced at Mobile World Congress. But it won't actually ship until summer, so it's impossible to know. The new iPad ships on 16 March, which gives it a significant lead. Update: thanks to many in the comments pointing to smartphones with equivalent pixel-per-inch layouts. (Wikipedia page with simple listing.) As is pointed out, many other manufacturers may have equivalent pixel density (around 300ppi) but aren't marketing them as such. Q: What use is LTE in the UK? A: At present, none at all, because the phone networks are all wrangling amongst themselves about who has the right to which frequencies. Ofcom's attempts to auction off the spectrum keep running into court challenges, which at least shows that the networks hold 4G (or perhaps its potential revenues) as valuable, but doesn't get us connected any sooner. Orange/T-Mobile is carrying out some tests in Cornwall and London, but to be honest for most people the LTE networking isn't going to be any use soon. Also, there are two different models of LTE connectivity, so there's going to be a risk for people who buy on one network and then think about going to another: particular iPads are set up for particular LTE systems. (This wasn't a problem for Motorola's Xoom, because it only offered LTE through Verizon's network in the US.) Q: What else is new? A: Apple has started moving away from Google in its maps. The iPhoto application uses OpenStreetMap maps, according to ISM's Jonathan Bennett, who said in a post that \"we're rather pleased to find they're the latest to switch to OpenStreetMap\". Apple's growing antipathy towards Google - initially over Android, then in its competition for mobile advertising attention, and then for pretty much everything, suggests that the company may be looking for other providers. But given that maps are a prime method for mobile advertising (Google has certainly begun monetising them), Apple is definitely going to be interested in doing its own mapping. The Maps app on iOS still uses Google - but some people have wondered how long that will last. Q: Where does this leave other tablets? A: Some analysts reckon this will increase Apple's share of the overall tablet market, even though that is growing. \"Apple to seize more than 70% of world tablet PC market in 2012 with new iPad 3\" said the (slightly breathless) email from IMS Research - which pointed out that Apple had 62% of the market in 2011 (white box makers 8% - one infers they're the cheap Chinese Android versions), Samsung 7%, Amazon 7%, Asus 3% and all the rest together taking 13%. But with the new product, IMS Research forecasts that approximately 70m iPads will be shipped in 2012, which would represent a 71% year-on-year growth. Gerry Xu, the company's PC market analyst, says: \"There is a large customer base loyal to Apple products that have been waiting for the latest tablet. Many owners of the iPad 1 are also expected to upgrade to the latest release. In addition to this consumer demand, growth is also forecast as a result of sales into enterprise and education\". The same opinion came from other analysts at the event; the data says that the tablet market presently breaks down to Apple, Samsung, Amazon and lots of also-rans. Gartner's Carolina Milanesi doesn't expect Windows 8 tablets to get any traction this year, so Apple has an open goal. No Android tablet comes close to the specifications (quad-core, sure, but retina display? No) or ecosystem (apps, yes, but music and films no, at least in Europe so far), and with the European tablet market having been a rout last year - given no Amazon Kindle Fire, and lots of legal issues for Samsung in Germany, one of the biggest markets in Europe - it's hard to see that changing. Add to the mix a cheaper iPad 2 which will hit some manufacturers at just the point where they were hoping to get an edge - price - and you can see that Apple replaying its iPod playbook, when it sliced and diced the competition by staying ahead in its ecosystem, and then through pricing, and then product mix. (In which case you might anticipate a smaller \"iPad mini\" at some point. But don't get your expectations up. Apple will definitely be happy with its iPad 2 and \"new iPad\" lineup all this year.) Q: What about Apple TV? A: As Juliette Garside points out, the improvements in Apple TV - 1080p video, a more app-like interface, and even \"apps\" for things like Netflix content - point towards the company readying itself to do more. Also iCloud has been updated so that any movies that you buy or rent from the iTunes Store will be available across any device you use. (You might as well just watch them on a new iPad - the display would be amazing.) So the Apple TV that everyone has been buzzing about isn't here - yet. But analysts, again, are itching with the certainty that something is on the way - noting Tim Cook's closing words at the presentation that \"Across the year you're going to see a lot more innovation. We are just getting started.\" (Then again, that's a common signoff from Apple executives, and often just means \"more computers on the way\" or similar.) Q: What's the take-away thought, then? A: First: Apple has pulled ahead of rival tablet makers with the retina display. Second, it has cut the pricing legs off those which hoped to sneak under with lower specifications and prices. Third: Apple has begun ever so quietly to cut its ties with Google. Fourth: unless Samsung and others can come up with a tablet with an OLED touchscreen, it's going to be a torrid year for many unless they can get Windows 8 tablets to a competitive price - but given that the Windows licence is going to cost them around $50 each, it's hard to see how that will happen. In fact, the happiest company apart from Apple after Wednesday's announcements is, without a doubt, Amazon: the Kindle Fire and Kindle e-reader remain untouched. Expect them to keep selling well.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Q: What is the new iPad called? Is it iPad 3, iPad HD, iPad RD (retina display), or what?</strong></p> <p>A: Just \"iPad\". It's \"the new iPad\". It doesn't have a generational name. Once something gets to a third generation - as here - Apple doesn't seem to bother with names. Except of course it does with the iPhone.</p> <p><strong>Q: What's different or new in the physical object?</strong></p> <p>A: A \"retina display\", LTE/4G networking capability, a battery with much more capacity (the screen and LTE systems are both power-hungry), a new chip (the \"A5X\"), 5 megapixel back camera, Bluetooth 4.0, 1080p video recording and stabilisation.</p> <p><strong>Q: What's happened to the iPad 2?</strong></p> <p>A: That carries on - with a price drop, from \u00a3399 to \u00a3329 (\u00a3429 for the 3G model) but only available in the low-end 16GB capacity.</p> <p><strong>Q: What's new in the software on the iPad?</strong></p> <p>A: \u2022 Voice dictation - which is Siri-lite, so the voice-to-text without the action; <br>\u2022 face detection in still pictures; <br>\u2022 iPhoto, an iOS version of its desktop app, but where you can now manipulate images directly; <br>\u2022 some tweaks and improvements to Garageband (\"smart strings\" - you can be the string section - and multiple recording across more than one iPad); <br>\u2022 improvements to iMovie (costing \u00a32.99) which let you cut film footage directly into \"trailers\" - because, as one of the demonstrators pointed out, these days nobody is going to cut a film of five minutes of shaky camera with Dad on the beach. (Note the image stabilisation too - and expect that in the next iPhone iteration.)</p> <p>Apple also released a software update, iOS 5.1, on Wednesday night, which has various bugfixes and improvements, mainly to the iPhone, though it also lets you delete photos from iCloud's feed - a much-requested feature.</p> <p><strong>Q: What is the retina display like close up - and what does retina display mean, anyway?</strong></p> <p>A: Even close up, it's virtually impossible to see individual pixels.

      "bodyText": "Scientists are warning of further solar storms this week after Earth was hit on Thursday by one of the fastest clouds of energy to emerge from the surface of the sun in recent years. The source of the cloud of particles, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), was a solar flare that erupted from an active region on the sun's surface that rotated into view on 3 March. The \"weather\" in space around Earth follows an 11-year cycle that depends on the activity of the sun, with the current one predicted to peak in 2013. Increased solar activity means more flares and CMEs \u2013 dense packets of charged particles that can crash into the Earth's magnetic field and create geomagnetic storms. This most often results in auroras near the poles but the energy released during the storms can also disrupt satellites, power stations and electrical systems. It can also increase the radiation that astronauts and anyone in an aircraft near the poles might experience. Satellite images of the latest flare show \"a complex network of sunspots indicating a large amount of stored magnetic energy\", according to the British Geological Survey (BGS). The particles left the sun at more than 1,200 miles per second and, due to interplanetary dust and gas, slowed on the way to Earth, crashing into our magnetic field at more than 800 miles per second at about 11am on Thursday. The relative orientation of the Earth's magnetic field to the CME has, so far, managed to repel its worst potential effects, but according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), that situation might change later this week as the event continues and more CMEs hit. Dr Jonathan Eastwood, a research fellow in space and atmospheric physics at Imperial College London, said: \"At the moment, the Earth's magnetic field is trying to deflect the solar material around the Earth, and scientists in the UK and around the world are monitoring the situation to see if our magnetic shield will hold up.\" There was a good chance, he said, that the magnetic field's protection would break down some time on Friday, leading to a geomagnetic storm. \"According to the NOAA space weather prediction centre, this could cause intermittent satellite navigation [GPS] and high frequency radio problems, especially in more polar regions, as well as bright auroral displays in northern regions.\" Large magnetic fluctuations caused by a CME can disrupt the national grid and increase the levels of ionising particles around satellites in space and damage solar arrays and onboard digital systems. \"The event is the largest for several years, but it is not in the most severe class,\" said Dr Craig Underwood of the Surrey space centre at Surrey University. \"We may expect more storms of this kind and perhaps much more severe ones in the next year or so as we approach solar maximum. \"Such events act as a wake-up call as to how our modern western lifestyles are utterly dependent on space technology and national power grid infrastructure.\" Space engineers, he added, went to some lengths to ensure that spacecraft could continue to operate under the hostile conditions of a geomagnetic storm. Mark Gibbs, a Met Office space weather expert, said the impact of the CME would probably result in some airlines redirecting flights away from polar routes. The geomagnetic storm would also increase the chances of seeing the aurora borealis, or northern lights, in the UK \u2013 however it was expected that Thursday's weather would have been too cloudy to see anything clearly. \"For the majority of people, a solar storm of this magnitude will pass largely unnoticed,\" Gibbs said. Prof Alan Woodward of the computing department at Surrey University said the Earth could expect more storms in coming months. \"As the 2012 Olympics approach we have a convergence of an event that is the most connected, computer-intensive event ever with a record level of sunspot activity, which typically leads to solar flares. \"We have the potential this year to see what planners call a Black Swan event: one that is unlikely but if it happens will have an extraordinary impact on our lives. The last similar event was the Japanese tsunami which caused massive physical damage. \"This year we could see equally devastating results from the disappearance of our computer systems.\" Computers can be \"hardened\" to withstand the effects of electrical interference but very few are, said Woodward. \"Even those in safety-critical situations such as engine management systems on aircraft, or medical devices, are vulnerable. How often have you seen the signs to turn off your mobile phone as it may interfere? \"Now imagine the combined effects of billions of mobile phones all operating at once. Without computers the modern world would simply cease to function. Life as we know it would grind to a halt. \"It is therefore scary to know that these computers are remarkably susceptible to electronic interference which can bring about this situation.\" The sun's active region is still growing and may produce other large flares in coming days. \"As it rotates across the face of the sun and in front of the Earth, it becomes more likely that we will be in the path of any further CMEs with resulting magnetic storms and auroral displays,\" said the BGS.",

      "bodyText": "The BBC's chief financial officer Zarin Patel has said the corporation has \"stopped worrying about gender issues\". On any day such a remark might have been viewed as unfortunate. On International Women's Day, doubly so. Patel, who is a member of the BBC's executive board, said: \"To be honest, we have stopped worrying about gender issues at the BBC. \"In fact, in my team one of the things we worry about is whether there are enough men.\" Patel made the comments in an interview with accountancy and finance magazine, Economia, and appears to contradict the sentiments of director general Mark Thompson, who said last month that there were \"manifestly too few older women broadcasting on the BBC\". Thompson was speaking a year after former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly's landmark age discrimination win against the corporation. Patel said: \"Half the BBC's workforce is female and that is reflected in finance. Just over a third (35%) of our senior leaders are women and 45% of the board. That's well above average and are only a few companies can match it. She added: \"We haven't just arrived at these figures over night. The BBC has had targets for quite a while - and yes, that's targets but not quotas. \"We started thinking about these issues almost 20 years ago, largely because we had very enlightened leadership who thought that there should be more women in senior positions, if only to reflect population trends. \"You have to think about this as a long-term target. It's very important to work on the talent pipeline, rather than just putting women on boards because it's fashionable to do so.\" Patel, who earns a total pay package of \u00a3365,000, said as a woman you \"want to do good work and be recruited into a role because of who you are and what you do, rather than because of the fact that you are a particular gender\". A BBC spokeswoman said: \"As Zarin says, the BBC has made good progress with women's representation across its workforce and today half of the BBC's staff and five of the executive board members are female. We are now focused on applying the same thinking to the representation of women on air and on screen.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "The Downside sports centre on an inner-city estate in Southwark, south London, is not a million miles from the capital's top football clubs, Lord's cricket ground or Twickenham, English rugby's HQ. But it might as well be for some of those who use it. Attempting to bridge social divides, however, for people in their teens and early 20s is a new, ambitious project that introduces \"pint-sized\" versions of leading sports to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Nineteen people training to be coaches for the project have stayed the course since signing up in October; one had previously been in prison and others had had brushes of varying severity with the law. They are flag-bearers for an initiative aimed at ultimately introducing 4,000 children on 12 estates in six London boroughs to the joys of sport over the coming months. The Street Elite scheme, run by the Lord's Taverners and Cricket for Change charities, may not be the first to bring games out of stadiums and on to estates, but it is unusual in involving young session leaders from such similar backgrounds to those they hope to enthuse. If successful in helping young people to learn to work in teams, play by the rules and make positive choices about their lives, it will be taken to other cities. For Shaddai Olafinbinu, 23, from Bermondsey, south London, being here \"has really changed my life\". He left jail last summer after serving a year for robbery. \"I thought I needed something to keep me away from trouble, to keep me focused so I didn't go back inside,\" he says. \"Ever since I came here, I have loved it. It is fun, challenging and inspiring.\" In two-hour sessions at the Downside centre, he and others learned how to umpire or referee games, perform first aid and understand sporting injuries; how to organise competitions, including advertising the event and recruiting players; and how to defuse conflict on and off the pitch. They have also been taught about child protection, given job interview tips. \"Coming here has helped me,\" says Olafinbinu, who had done some previous football coaching. \"I thought I could never get back into sports. I had given up.\" The programme, aimed at 16- to 24-year-olds not in employment, education or training (neets), started just months after riots rocked English cities. Organisers say such experiments are vital at a time when there are almost 1 million neets in England and sporting participation is said to be showing little \"Olympics effect\": just over one in four 16- to 19-year-olds do at least three 30-minute moderate intensity sessions a week, research suggests. The \u00a3100,000 pilot, part-funded by Berkeley Group developers, continues with the coaches taking the games to estates and helping at local festivals of sport. Matthew Patten, chief executive of the Taverners, said his \"establishment\" charity had moved from helping \"white middle-class kids on green fields, playing in whites, to the frontline of socially profound issues\". Finding new sporting talent would be lovely, he says, but adds: \"This ultimately is about getting young people into work. \"Government programmes are really important but we would argue one size doesn't fit all. This is a small local programme and is about pastoral care. \"The challenges are really severe and this is only the beginning. But we do want to make sure we can walk before we can run.\" Only five of the original 24 starters had dropped out. \"If we can get 50% of these young people into employment, the value of that goes well beyond the price of this activity,\" Patten says. Many on the programme had experienced being knocked back, said Si Ledwith of Cricket for Change. Yet some had already found work or were studying. \"We are talking about contentious issues, anything from gang culture, to drug use, respect, decision-making and realising that changing your opinion is absolutely fine \u2026 The more young people get into sport at a younger age, ultimately the less crime there will be in their communities.\" Kemar Campbell, 21, from Peckham, though out of work now, says he had held down jobs, worked with a local community charity and had studied both business and sport. \"I am a sporting person, I like to help, and I get certificates at the end of it \u2026 I would like to be a financial consultant. At the end of the day, we all have to have ambitions.\" Akiem McCarthy, 20, from Lewisham, recently ran a street cricket game on an estate. \"We had to start from scratch. There were smiles. No casualties, and it was all good at the end of the day.\" Suliemen Mirza, 18, from Hackney, says he has encountered gangs and people dealing drugs in the past and would now be able to tell those people there were alternatives. \"Hopefully I can open doors for them,\" he says. \"I have always been a confident speaker but I have learned not to shout and how to defuse situations.\" Short sport Cricket \u2013 Street20 Two plastic bats, two plastic sets of wickets, tennis ball wrapped in electrical tape, up to six players a side. Each game lasts 20 balls a side \u2013 five players bowl four each (sixth keeps wicket). Rugby \u2013 Street4s Tag version of sport, with no posts. Crossing the try line is followed by kicking the ball towards your own side, one of whom has to catch it to bring extra points for the conversion. \u2013 Football Five-a-side Ball kept below head height, with change of goalkeeper after a score.

      "bodyText": "Like Boston and Glasgow, Liverpool has long been synonymous with emigration from the Emerald Isle. For a while, the Celtic Tiger roared and the direction of travel was the other way across the Irish Sea. But the economic sands have shifted again, and Merseyside is the destination for a new generation of migrants. Up to 75,000 Irish citizens are predicted to emigrate in 2012 \u2013 higher than the levels of the late 1980s. In a country with a population of 4.5 million, such shifts generate intense interest and the Irish Times has even created a Generation Emigration blog, with the headline styled up as a departure board. With rising unemployment, young people, particularly men in their late teens and early 20s, are turning to other European countries, Australia and the Middle East for work. There are now 356,000 Irish nationals livingin the UK, latest Office for National Statistics figures show, with the number of arrivals second only to Polish immigrants. Emigration has not run at such high levels since 1989, when 44,000 people left. Its impact was underscored when the Gaelic football association was unable to field teams last winter because there weren't enough men on the Dingle peninsula. Liverpool, which has a long history of immigration from Ireland \u2013 up to three-quarters of its residents claim some Irish genes \u2013 is experiencing a new wave of Irish migration. An academic and former journalist, associate professor Michael Mulqueen and his wife, Fidelma, bought their dream house in 2008, when he was lecturing at the University of Limerick. Their two children were settled in school and they had close family nearby in County Clare. Then he was offered a job as head of the department of politics, media and communication at Liverpool Hope University. \"It was a hugely difficult decision on the family front, because we didn't want to uproot the children,\" Mulqueen said. \"There was the instability, but there was also the lure of the job.\" Initially, Mulqueen commuted from Ireland each week with great support from his faculty dean, who had been a similar situation. He would leave on Sunday evening and return to his family late on Thursday. \"It was an intensively busy time with very long and challenging days,\" he recalls. \"During the week we'd have Skype conversations, but the children intimated that they were not terribly happy with that. We made the decision that we'd have to go for it and emigrate.\" The family arrived in Liverpool in February 2011. His wife was still working in Limerick, so began commuting in the other direction for a couple of months. Finding a place in the right school for their children proved complex and he imagines it would be much worse with English as a second language. The family enjoyed their first Christmas in Liverpool, are making friends and say they settled quickly. Mulqueen says there are similarities between Liverpool and Limerick. \"While Liverpool's regeneration is yet to be fully realised, it has made enormous strides since I first came here as a visitor in the early 1990s. Limerick, on the other hand, is a city that's experiencing almost identical problems of social deprivation, housing and estates that are zones of despair.\" Mulqueen grew up in Galway county, which had pockets of social disadvantage and in the early 1990s after university, a tranche of his peers migrated from Ireland. Does he feel guilty about leaving? He says the Irish government has realised the huge contribution that education can make to economic growth and has invested heavily, so he believes it won't be such an issue for future generations. Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, caused consternation in January when he branded migration \"a lifestyle choice\" and said it wasn't to do with the economic crisis. Noonan, who has three children living abroad, said: \"There are always young people coming and going from Ireland and some of them are emigrants in the traditional sense. Others simply want to get off the island for a while. A lot of the people who go to Australia \u2026 it's not being driven by unemployment at home, it's driven by a desire to see another part of the world and live there.\" He later said he'd been quoted out of context. Willie O'Dea, a Fianna F\u00e1il spokesman, called on Noonan to apologise. \"Of course there are many young people who, after college, travel abroad. But there is an undeniable link between the high rate of unemployment and the number of people seeking work abroad,\" he said. The Generation Emigration blog is full of stories of Irish nationals moving further afield, such as Ruth Barrett O'Sullivan, a teacher, who followed husband Jer, an engineer, to Saudi Arabia, last summer after almost a year apart. The couple, who have three children, married in the hazy days of the Celtic Tiger in 2007. They now live in a compound in Riyadh. She wrote: \"The weather is fantastic, and there's lots of organised activities for the kids. We have made friends with families from all over the world. We are not necessarily looking at this as a permanent move, but we have no plans to go home any time soon. We have nothing to go home to.\" Alan Barrett, of the Economic Social and Research Institute, described the return of emigration as one of the most traumatic elements of the Irish collapse. \"For all the years from independence to the Celtic Tiger of the 1990s, people born in Ireland could never assume that they would work in Ireland. That changed with the Celtic Tiger, but has now reversed again. \"As was the case in previous emigration waves, the UK remains a main destination for Irish emigrants. However, the poor state of the UK labour market and the relative strength of the Australian economy means that Australia is attracting more Irish people in this wave.\" He did not share the concern that this outflow would limit Ireland's chance of economic growth. \"The experience of the 1980s and 1990s suggests that while people will go when times are bad, they will return when things get better.\"",

      "bodyText": "British music startup Songkick has raised a \u00a36.3m ($10m) funding round led by Sequoia, the US venture capital firm whose previous investments include Apple, Google, YouTube, PayPal and Dropbox. It's the first time Sequoia has invested in a startup headquartered in the UK, according to Songkick's chief executive Ian Hogarth, who says the funding will give his company the resources \"to continue to innovate\" in the months ahead. Songkick's existing investors, who include Index Ventures and Y Combinator, also participated in the new round. Songkick was set up by Hogarth and two friends, Michelle You and Pete Smith in 2007, with the aim of building a business around live music. Its service maintains global listings for music gigs, enabling fans to be alerted when their favourite artists announce a concert near them. The site now attracts 5m monthly unique visitors, which Hogarth says makes it the second biggest live-music site in the world behind Ticketmaster. \"We set this company up as three friends in an attic with the simple idea that fans would go to more concerts if someone made it really easy, and focused on the bands rather than just the venues,\" he says. \"We've since gathered proof that it makes a meaningful difference to people's lives: when people start using Songkick, they go to almost twice as many gigs the year after.\" Songkick has tried to stay neutral since launching, working with ticketing firms including Ticketmaster, TicketWeb and Eventbrite on an affiliate basis: it doesn't sell tickets itself, but points its users towards those companies' sites. Meanwhile, Songkick also has partnerships to provide its concert database to services including YouTube, Spotify, MTV, Vevo and SoundCloud. It also has a popular iPhone app, and was also one of the launch partners for Spotify's desktop apps platform in November 2011. Securing investment from Sequoia is a big deal for Songkick, but also for other startups in London \u2013 or for that matter, the UK and Europe. Alongside Shazam (which counts Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Institutional Venture Partners among its investors) and SoundCloud (also KPCB, as well as Index and Union Square Ventures), Songkick shows that companies on this side of the Atlantic can attract investment from the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital firms. \"They've invested in us despite where we are,\" says Hogarth, chuckling. \"The bar is much higher if you want to get investment from a west-coast Valley VC if you're in London. But Sequoia are a phenomenal venture capital firm, and [partner] Greg McAdoo is really aligned with our belief in connecting artists and fans.\" Songkick isn't saying much about its plans for the funding round, although Hogarth talks about ongoing work on new features and products that will launch later in 2012. There is competition, though, including from one of Songkick's key partners: Ticketmaster. The company has been adding more social and editorial features to its service in the last year or two. It also recently launched an iPhone app with a library-scanning feature similar to Songkick's own app, while its parent company Live Nation has just acquired startup Setlist.fm, which has built its own database of concerts and set lists. Could Ticketmaster eat Songkick's lunch? Hogarth chooses his words carefully. \"Our relationship with Ticketmaster is that we're a partner of theirs trying to sell more tickets for them as an e-commerce company,\" he says. \"We're trying to be a great partner for those guys, but what's been a bit challenging for us to parse is what their strategy is. Every day they release something that is closer to what Songkick looks like than to what Ticketmaster used to look like. We have to try to read between the lines.\" Hogarth is bullish about Songkick's plans for new products later this year, though. In the meantime, he thinks other startups in the UK can take heart from his company's funding round, and what it says about Sequoia's openness to investing in other British companies. \"Hopefully now they have one investment in London, it may make it easier for them to make another one,\" he says.",

Since then, we have been working closely with the Nigerian authorities to try to find Chris and Franco, and to secure their release. The terrorists holding the two hostages made very clear threats to take their lives, including in a video that was posted on the internet. After months of not knowing where they were being held, we received credible information about their location. A window of opportunity arose to secure their release. We also had reason to believe that their lives were under imminent and growing danger. Preparations were made to mount an operation to attempt to rescue Chris and Franco. Together with the Nigerian government, today I authorised it to go ahead, with UK support. It is with great regret that I have to say that both Chris and Franco have lost their lives. We are still awaiting confirmation of the details, but the early indications are clear that both men were murdered by their captors, before they could be rescued. Our immediate thoughts must be with Chris and Franco's families, and we offer them our sincerest condolences. Both families have endured a terrible ordeal, and this is a devastating moment for all of them. The Foreign Office have been in regular contact with the McManus family since Chris's capture. I spoke to them just before Christmas and I have spoken to them again with the news this afternoon. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Nigerian authorities, and President Jonathan personally, for all they have done to help find Chris, and combat terrorism. I also want to pay tribute to all those, including UK personnel, who worked so hard to try to bring Chris home safely. I am very sorry that this ended so tragically. I ask that the media respect the family's privacy and allow them time to come to terms with their loss. Terrorism and appalling crimes such as these are a scourge on our world. No-one should be in any doubt about our determination to fight and to defeat them.",

He was taken hostage with his colleague, an Italian national, Franco Lamolinara.</p> <p>Since then, we have been working closely with the Nigerian authorities to try to find Chris and Franco, and to secure their release.</p> <p>The terrorists holding the two hostages made very clear threats to take their lives, including in a video that was posted on the internet.</p> <p>After months of not knowing where they were being held, we received credible information about their location.</p> <p>A window of opportunity arose to secure their release.</p> <p>We also had reason to believe that their lives were under imminent and growing danger.</p> <p>Preparations were made to mount an operation to attempt to rescue Chris and Franco. Together with the Nigerian government, today I authorised it to go ahead, with UK support.</p> <p>It is with great regret that I have to say that both Chris and Franco have lost their lives.</p> <p>We are still awaiting confirmation of the details, but the early indications are clear that both men were murdered by their captors, before they could be rescued.</p> <p>Our immediate thoughts must be with Chris and Franco's families, and we offer them our sincerest condolences.</p> <p>Both families have endured a terrible ordeal, and this is a devastating moment for all of them.</p> <p>The Foreign Office have been in regular contact with the McManus family since Chris's capture. I spoke to them just before Christmas and I have spoken to them again with the news this afternoon.</p> <p>I want to take this opportunity to thank the Nigerian authorities, and President Jonathan personally, for all they have done to help find Chris, and combat terrorism.</p> <p>I also want to pay tribute to all those, including UK personnel, who worked so hard to try to bring Chris home safely. I am very sorry that this ended so tragically.</p> <p>I ask that the media respect the family's privacy and allow them time to come to terms with their loss.</p> <p>Terrorism and appalling crimes such as these are a scourge on our world. No-one should be in any doubt about our determination to fight and to defeat them.</p>",

The peace and the wellbeing of Iranians are endangered by the confrontational policies of Iran and certain western countries,\" said a joint statement issued by more than 200 women's rights activists and 15 political organisations, published on opposition websites. \"The continuation of this situation, will cast a shadow of war and a militarised atmosphere over our country, exposing our people, women in particular, to further discrimination, various kinds of violence, poverty and adversity.\" A list of activists who have signed the statement include prominent lawyers and campaigners including Mehrangiz Kar, Parvin Ardalan, Mansoureh Shojaee and Soehila Vahdati. Supporters of Iran's One Million Signatures campaign, which has highlighted discriminatory laws against women in the country are also among the signatories. Many members of the campaign, as well as women's rights lawyers are currently behind bars, including Nasrin Sotoudeh and Bahareh Hedayat. Change for Equality, a women's rights website run by a group of Iranian activists, has also published a series of videos, recorded by campaigners, warning against the consequences of war for the country's democratic movements. \"Every day that we spend at war or in conditions of war, is filled with the fear of the death of the our achievements, which have come about through years of struggle,\" said the website in a statement. \"War for us, means destructive violence committed against women and children. It means more severe crackdowns. It signifies the silencing of our demands and civil protest.\" Watch the rest of the videos on Change for Equality website here. This week, Ahmed Shaheed, the UN's Iran special rapporteur also issued its latest report on the violation of human rights in Iran, including discrimination against women. Read Shaheed's full report here. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, an NGO that monitors rights violations in Iran, said that Shaheed's report is \"a significant document that gives voice to the victims of widespread violations\". \"Iranian authorities not only barred Shaheed from visiting the country but also publicly insulted him and called him a liar,\" said the campaign's spokesman, Hadi Ghaemi. \"Despite these obstacles and intimidations, his insistence on carrying out an independent investigation has resulted in a comprehensive documentation of many aspects of the ongoing human rights crisis.\"",

      "bodyText": "The senior executive at Dow Chemical responsible for its Olympic sponsorship has insisted there is no chance of it dropping the controversial wrap that will surround the stadium at the London Games. Campaigners have called on London 2012 organisers to end their relationship with Dow over claimed links to the 1984 Bhopal disaster, which killed more than 15,000 people. But George Hamilton, Dow's vice-president of Olympic operations, described the company's critics as \"irresponsible\". Hamilton said: \"This issue is not our issue. We're not going to be bullied by activists or politicians who want to get involved in this, whatever their driver may be. We're not going to allow that to make us waver from our commitment to the Olympic movement.\" Dow signed a $100m (\u00a363m) 10-year deal with the International Olympic Committee in 2010 and last summer agreed to sponsor the \u00a37m wrap that will surround the stadium. The issue has led to calls from politicians, including Tessa Jowell, the shadow Olympics minister and London 2012 board member, and Ken Livingstone, Labour's London mayoral candidate, to scrap the deal. But the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the IOC have repeatedly backed Dow's stance. London 2012's chairman, Lord Coe, this week defended the association in the face of hostile questioning from the London Assembly member Navin Shah, who said the issue was \"damaging the credibility of the standing of London and the Games\". Hamilton said: \"The people attacking Dow have woefully underestimated our character and who we are. They have underestimated our character, the contribution we've made to responsible care and use of chemicals, and they've underestimated our stamina. We've been here for 112 years and we're planning to go for the next 100.\" Hamilton said that it had bought the assets of Union Carbide, the company that owned the Bhopal plant at the time of the gas leak, seven years after the Indian subsidiary had been divested to a third company, McLeod Russel India Ltd. He said: \"We didn't buy the Indian assets or liabilities because they had sold them to McLeod Russel. So now to get Dow to take some action that says we are responsible. Legally? No. Ethically, morally? No.\" The issue has escalated to the point where Indian government officials are considering boycotting the opening and closing ceremonies. The IOC on Thursday responded to a letter from the Indian sports ministry asking it to reconsider by restating its position that Dow neither owned nor operated the plant at the time of the disaster. Barry Gardiner, the Labour MP who is leading a group calling for the deal to be re-examined, said that the issue of Dow's liability over Bhopal was only one among several that made it unfit to be associated with the Olympics. \"This is not simply about one thing in a particular point in time. This company is not fit to be associated with the most sustainable Olympic Games ever.\" Following a recent Westminster Hall debate, Gardiner said that he had written again to Coe outlining a series of issues with Dow and with the procurement process. He said he had yet to receive a reply. Hamilton said Dow had decided to get involved with the Olympics to reach into new markets, including Russia and Brazil where the next two Games will take place, accelerate its \"transformation strategy\" of moving from being seen as the equivalent of a utilities company to a \"solutions provider\" and as a staff motivation tool.",

The first edition since the fanzines were seized goes on sale tonight ahead of Manchester United's Europa League meeting with Athletic Bilbao, with Red Issue's owners trying to establish how the police's actions affected sales. This is one avenue any legal proceedings may explore. The police acted ahead of Liverpool's meeting with Manchester United on 11 February, the first time Luis Su\u00e1rez had faced Patrice Evra following the former's eight-match ban for racially abusing the left-back. Su\u00e1rez refused to shake Evra's hand ahead of the match, an act for which he subsequently apologised. Steven Ross, a solicitor with Brecher who has so far acted on a pro bono basis for Red Issue, stated that the publishers intended it to be satirical. \"The advice that we received from leading counsel \u2013 Andrew Thomas QC of Lincoln House chambers \u2013 was that the back page image was plainly anti-racist, and satirical and incapable of falling within the definition of \"racial hatred\" under section 17 of the Public Order Act 1986 \u2013 being the grounds on which GMP apparently seized the magazines in the first place. \"I wrote to GMP asking them to return the magazines and advising them that if the magazines were not returned, Red Issue would consider applying for an injunction to compel their return as well as reserving Red Issue's right to claim damages in respect of any losses it may suffer as a result of the seizure. \"Written confirmation was sought from GMP that they would not take any action to prevent the future sale and distribution of the magazine. GMP agreed to return the magazines \u2013 notwithstanding an ongoing criminal investigation \u2013 which was not pursued \u2013 but refused to give the assurance sought because, amongst other things, GMP were concerned that the article could be used to provoke unlawful violence at the Ajax match \u2013 the next game after Liverpool [in the Europa League] due to the fact that Ajax have 'predominantly Jewish supporters'. \"As GMP did not give the assurances required, Red Issue had to go to reprint censoring the article for fear of further arrests and seizures at the Ajax game and in an attempt to mitigate the losses they had suffered by virtue of the seizure on 11 February 2012 and I am now instructed by Red Issue to formulate a claim against GMP for damages suffered by Red Issue.\" The police said they were initially alerted to the existence of the KKK edition by the club. However, Manchester United said that GMP acted independently and were not alerted by the club to the fanzine's existence. Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts said: \"This article, as acknowledged by CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] was certainly capable of causing offence and Manchester United also considered it of concern as they initially alerted GMP to its existence and prevented supporters entering the stadium with the Ku Klux Klan image on display.\" Red Issue told the Guardian this morning that they \"expect\" GMP to monitor the edition when it goes on sale tonight.",

      "bodyText": "The teaching of contemporary literature in universities is often, strangely, a fraught business when it comes to deciding which works should be prioritised and what contexts they should be taught in. Comparative with other contemporary works in the same language, from the same country? In terms of cultural co-ordinates, political and ethical similarities and differences? In terms of aesthetic and prosodic qualities or subterfuges? Or just because the teacher just likes or respects a particular work? Whatever the approach, teachers of contemporary writing inevitably make some form of qualification against or through edifices of historically established literatures and thoughts, and new writing must necessarily speak in that context whether it likes it or not. However, though the mapping of communal, regional, national and even international literary trends is de rigueur in most universities, it seems to me problematical to declare what should be taught when attempting to survey and comprehend a particular environment of creative writing activity. Of course, literary history proffers its salient and pivotal points, its literary highlights that branch off into myriad new directions through their influence. But once we start declaring what they should be, especially when foisting a national literature on students/readers, and how and why they should be taught in universities, we are blatantly gatekeeping: setting agendas of control and manipulation. The teacher becomes an extension of the state in more ways than being its employee or citizen. In the light of these issues, it is surely vital to think in terms of a national literature, historically or contemporary, with flexibility and an openness to change and reassessment. To have a literary heritage declared, embodied as essential, is stifling in so many ways. In a recent article in the Age newspaper, Michael Heyward rightly lamented the underappreciation of literary works of earlier Australia. I agree with him insofar as I feel all literary works should be made available (where such an availability doesn't come at too great a cost to environment or people), and in fact Australia has not been backward in this, as demonstrated by the collection of more than 300 Australian literary and historical texts on the Sydney University SETIS site. But surely it should be Australias, plural? The fact is, there is no one Australia and never has been. Neither is there an English-language-only Australia, thank goodness. Australian English-language authors have often looked to Britain (and the US) not only because of a cultural cringe or a belief that the authority of the entire English canon might filter out and give them a minuscule amount of space in the Grand History, but because Australia's is such a small literary market: you don't sell as many books. Now, I think this is repugnant thinking \u2013 a book is as strong as its reader anywhere at any time \u2013 but few writers don't hope for a pay-day. And some will happily have that pay-day in editions in as many countries as possible. What they write about may be more at issue here. To be Australian and worldly at once, to project outwards as well as inwards, helps. And I agree with this, but it worries me if it's merely to reinforce \"who we are\", when who we are is often violent, racist, environmentally destructive, and collectively, thieves (indigenous Australians, including indigenous writers \u2013 have still received no systematic compensation for the theft of land and all related to it). Australian 'classics' are too often limited to texts that work as affirmations of Australian identity: about being Australian, if not being in Australia. In fact, the much-lauded Miles Franklin award is unapologetically nationalistic: given to a \"published novel or play portraying Australian life in any of its phases\". Which is not to say that the winning book has to be landscape-specific, but rather that it needs to deal with Australiannness in some way. That's what \"classics\" are about in this context \u2013 and that's what worries me. And I say that as a poet almost entirely concerned with place \u2013 and a specific (wheatbelt) place at that, which I write of inside and outside Australia with varying degrees of anxiety and tension (for all the above reasons and more). Today I was supervising a class on Australian literature at Cambridge. One student recognised the anxiety in a story by Henry Lawson (who sought the literary way in London) and another, I pointed towards Henry Handel Richardson (who found her literary self in Europe). With yet another, I discussed feminism, nationalism and racism in Miles Franklin. But the most significant recommendation I made was to read Lionel Fogarty, indigenous Australian poet who doesn't feed nationalism, affirms his community and people, and reinforces identity without pursuing \"classic\" status. In using the resurrection of literary works as part of a canonical ploy to create a sense of national identity, to define the \"classics\" by which we might anchor our own vicarious and precarious identities, we run the risk of affirming the many other dubious tenets of any nationalism. Nationalism is about exclusion, about quarantine, about community in which consensus, the rights of all to have a say, are ceded to bodies of authority. Nothing exemplifies this more than condemning universities for not teaching enough of the literary texts of the nation (which helps fund them, and which they are supposed to varying degrees to \"represent\"). If a book is out of print, it is difficult for a university to set it as a text. There's a circular logic at work there, with publishers relying in part on course settings, and teachers relying on publishers. Digitised versions are changing the dynamic somewhat. I have nothing against the teaching of \"Australian literature\", and have, indeed, taught a great deal of it myself. But not teaching those \"classic\" texts doesn't mean one is doing a disservice to Australian writing. In fact, teaching those books alongside non-classics, or indeed, teaching works that weren't part of the zeitgeist in their time, can often be more illuminating, more challenging to the status quo, and more generative. One could start by trying to track texts written in, say, Australian Greek, Chinese, German, Vietnamese \u2013 or even understand the politics of appropriation in materials transliterated (with and without consent) from indigenous creators/speakers/singers who might well have different versions of what constitutes \"writing\", and indeed the \"literature\" of a people. And the many indigenous poets, storytellers, fictionalists, and witnesses who have been providing texts or recording their stories in their own languages or adaptations of \"English\" for many many decades.",

I agree with him insofar as I feel all literary works should be made available (where such an availability doesn't come at too great a cost to environment or people), and in fact Australia has not been backward in this, as demonstrated by <a href=\"http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/oztexts/ozlit.html\" title=\"\">the collection of more than 300 Australian literary and historical texts on the Sydney University SETIS site</a>. But surely it should be Australias, plural?</p> <p>The fact is, there is no one Australia and never has been. Neither is there an English-language-only Australia, thank goodness. Australian English-language authors have often looked to Britain (and the US) not only because of a cultural cringe or a belief that the authority of the entire English canon might filter out and give them a minuscule amount of space in the Grand History, but because Australia's is such a small literary market: you don't sell as many books. Now, I think this is repugnant thinking \u2013 a book is as strong as its reader anywhere at any time \u2013 but few writers don't hope for a pay-day. And some will happily have that pay-day in editions in as many countries as possible.</p> <p>What they write about may be more at issue here. To be Australian and worldly at once, to project outwards as well as inwards, helps. And I agree with this, but it worries me if it's merely to reinforce \"who we are\", when who we are is often violent, racist, environmentally destructive, and collectively, thieves (indigenous Australians, including indigenous writers \u2013 have still received no systematic compensation for the theft of land and all related to it). Australian 'classics' are too often limited to texts that work as affirmations of Australian identity: about being Australian, if not being in Australia. In fact, the much-lauded <a href=\"http://www.milesfranklin.com.au/\" title=\"\">Miles Franklin award</a> is unapologetically nationalistic: given to a \"published novel or play portraying Australian life in any of its phases\". Which is not to say that the winning book has to be landscape-specific, but rather that it needs to deal with Australiannness in some way. That's what \"classics\" are about in this context \u2013 and that's what worries me. And I say that as a poet almost entirely concerned with place \u2013 and a specific (wheatbelt) place at that, which I write of inside and outside Australia with varying degrees of anxiety and tension (for all the above reasons and more).</p> <p>Today I was supervising a class on Australian literature at Cambridge. One student recognised the anxiety in a story by <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lawson-henry-7118\" title=\"\">Henry Lawson</a> (who sought the literary way in London) and another, I pointed towards <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/richardson-ethel-florence-henry-handel-8202\" title=\"\">Henry Handel Richardson</a> (who found her literary self in Europe). With yet another, I discussed feminism, nationalism and racism in Miles Franklin. But the most significant recommendation I made was to read <a href=\"http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/fogarty-lionel\" title=\"\">Lionel Fogarty</a>, indigenous Australian poet who doesn't feed nationalism, affirms his community and people, and reinforces identity without pursuing \"classic\" status.</p> <p>In using the resurrection of literary works as part of a canonical ploy to create a sense of national identity, to define the \"classics\" by which we might anchor our own vicarious and precarious identities, we run the risk of affirming the many other dubious tenets of any nationalism. Nationalism is about exclusion, about quarantine, about community in which consensus, the rights of all to have a say, are ceded to bodies of authority.</p> <p>Nothing exemplifies this more than condemning universities for not teaching enough of the literary texts of the nation (which helps fund them, and which they are supposed to varying degrees to \"represent\"). If a book is out of print, it is difficult for a university to set it as a text. There's a circular logic at work there, with publishers relying in part on course settings, and teachers relying on publishers. Digitised versions are changing the dynamic somewhat.</p> <p>I have nothing against the teaching of \"Australian literature\", and have, indeed, taught a great deal of it myself. But not teaching those \"classic\" texts doesn't mean one is doing a disservice to Australian writing.</p> <p>In fact, teaching those books alongside non-classics, or indeed, teaching works that weren't part of the zeitgeist in their time, can often be more illuminating, more challenging to the status quo, and more generative. One could start by trying to track texts written in, say, Australian Greek, Chinese, German, Vietnamese \u2013 or even understand the politics of appropriation in materials transliterated (with and without consent) from indigenous creators/speakers/singers who might well have different versions of what constitutes \"writing\", and indeed the \"literature\" of a people. And the many indigenous poets, storytellers, fictionalists, and witnesses who have been providing texts or recording their stories in their own languages or adaptations of \"English\" for many many decades.</p>",

The top riser on the blue chip index was Hammerson, up 21.3p at 411.3p. The company, which has property across the UK and France, rose after BNP Paribas sold a stake in Kl\u00e9pierre, a French shopping mall company. The mid-cap index gained 171.22 to close at 11,458.36. Supergroup, the company behind the ubiquitous Superbrand label, was the top mid-cap riser, picking up 46.5p to 568.5p. A relatively volatile stock, it seemed to be reacting to a positive broker note. Analysts at Peel Hunt said the brand does not appear to have lost momentum and \"genuine\" spring/summer ranges are hitting the stores for the first time. New ranges are also more discrete on branding. They kept a 'hold' recommendation on the stock with a 550p price target.

Among other things, they pointed to the launch of the iPad 3 and the reduced price of the iPad 2 as a catalyst for the shares. It is thought the iPad 3 could also reap higher royalties for ARM, as it uses a more complicated 4G chip. On the small-cap index, Bowleven, the West Africa-focused oil explorer, rose 12p to 97p.

Former Scotland Yard assistant commissioner Bob Quick has revealed that Green rang Coulson, then the Conservative party's director of communications, from Belgravia police station in London. Quick said in a written statement to the inquiry published on Thursday: \"At the police station Green went through the normal reception processes and, in accordance with standard procedure, was asked to nominate a person to be notified of his arrest and to whom he would be allowed one phone call. \"Green nominated Andy Coulson and was allowed to make one call to Mr Coulson. At the time Mr Coulson was director of communications for the Conservative party.\" The Tory MP was arrested and released on bail in connection with a series of leaks at the Home Office in 2008. Quick, who was the officer in charge of the investigation into leaks was quizzed about the arrests at Leveson on Wednesday and claimed that the investigation was dropped following pressure from the Conservative party, including leaks to rightwing papers. in his witness statement, Quick said that the former Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and ex-assistant commissioner John Yates both tried to persuade him to drop the controversial Green investigation. The Crown Prosecution Service announced in April 2009 that neither Green nor junior Home Office civil servant Christopher Galley would face prosecution over the leaks. Coulson was arrested and bailed by police on suspicion of phone hacking and corruption last July.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has marked the third anniversary of its decision to cut interest rates to 0.5% and begin an electronic money creation programme by leaving policy on an ultra-loose setting. Faced with a stubbornly weak economy, the City sees no prospect of Threadneedle Street tightening its monetary stance before the end of next year at the earliest, even though the lowest bank rate in history and the announcement of \u00a3325bn of quantitative easing have created losers as well as winners. Winners Mortgage payers: Cheap money has fed through into less expensive home loans, with particularly hefty gains for those on floating rate mortgages. For those in this group who held onto their jobs during the worst of the recession in the winter of 2008-09, there were sizeable reductions in their monthly repayments as bank rate came down from 5% to 0.5%. Although the full benefits were not passed on to mortgage payers by lenders, the reductions helped underpin consumer spending and limited home repossessions. In recent days, however, some of the biggest lenders have announced sharp increases in their standard variable mortgage rates. Exporters: The low level of interest rates, coupled with the increase in the money supply, has made sterling less attractive to investors. A weaker pound makes UK exports cheaper, providing a boost to manufacturing and those parts of the service sector that trade overseas. Much of the fall in sterling, however, took place before March 2009. Asset holders: An explicit aim of rock-bottom interest rates and the QE programme was to make it less attractive for people to hold on to cash. The Bank assumed that investors would seek out higher yields in property, the stock market, and commodities. Higher asset prices would, Threadneedle Street said, make people feel wealthier and thus increase economic confidence. Banks: Banks have been beneficiaries of the QE programme because they have been able to exchange assets \u2013 mainly government gilts \u2013 for cash, which they have used to repair balance sheets damaged during the financial crisis. The expected increase in bank lending to individuals and businesses as a result of stronger balance sheets has not, however, materialised. Losers Savers: The flipside to the gains for mortgage payers has been three years of pain for savers. Interest rates have collapsed, making life tougher for those \u2013 especially pensioners \u2013 dependent on the interest on nest eggs built up over their lifetime. The annual incomes of many pensioners are closely linked to official interest rates and groups representing savers have become increasingly vociferous in their criticism of the Bank of England. Pension funds: Shortfalls in pension funds have increased as a result of QE. When the price of a government gilt goes up, the interest rate (or yield) goes down, and the effect of the Bank's \u00a3325bn asset purchase programme has been to reduce the supply of government bonds, pushing up their price. Gilt yields, which are used as a rule-of-thumb guide to the future income of pension funds and of the likely inflation rate, have crashed, thus widening pension shortfalls. Consumers: One of the unintended side-effects of low interest rates and QE has been rising global commodity prices as investors sought out higher-yielding assets. Speculation in the oil market led to a near-doubling of the price of crude between early 2009 and early 2010, with food prices also rising sharply. Exacerbated by the weak pound, the annual inflation rate rose to above 5%, which squeezed consumer spending power and put the brake on economic recovery. Emerging markets: QE weakened currencies in developed countries such as the US and the UK, but led to higher exchange rates in some of the bigger emerging markets, such as Brazil and Mexico, leading to weaker exports, slower growth, the introduction of capital controls and the threat of currency wars.",

He does so in a revival of his 1966 adaptation of a Chekhov short story about a bourgeois young man, Misail, who shuns rank and privilege in favour of an honest working life. The ramifications of this decision provide the play's slow-burn tragedy. \"You haven't kept at your rules,\" Misail is told late on in the play. \"And you can't be allowed.\" Much of the pleasure here is in seeing a director on absolutely commanding form, working with dazzling confidence. Against Alison Chitty's blank-canvas design \u2013 vast floor-to-ceiling panels of bleached wood \u2013 scenes are full of exquisite detail, marking the class and status of the households. Furnishings are swept in during dynamic, extended scene changes featuring Terry Davies's stirring music. These, and haunting moments such as a line of men scything crops or the tableau-vivant that ends the first act, are the pulse of the production, contrasting with static scenes at dinner tables with endless cups of tea from samovars. It is around these samovars that Misail (Nicholas Shaw) tussles with idealistic non-conformity and the price paid for living with taut principles. Shaw needs to make us feel his struggle more directly early on, as it is otherwise expressed in wordy exchanges, although in the play's closing moments he is considerably more affecting. There are some terrific performances in the large cast: Alex Clatworthy as Misail's capricious wife, John-Paul Macleod as his peculiar colleague Ivan, and Clive Merrison as his intransigent father. The play feels topical, in its focus on youthful rebellion against privilege and corruption and a sense of a fast-changing Russia, but the question it poses is timeless. \"What,\" wonders Misail, \"are we for?\"",

Their emergence is understandable. They are neatly calculated to appeal across demographics, from arty indie kids enamoured with the Black Keys' heavy-duty bluesy garage rock to defiantly unreconstructed head-bangers. Yet proficient as their protean thrash undeniably is, there is little unprecedented or original about them. They have excited frequent comparisons to the White Stripes, but actually bear a stronger resemblance to Jack White's the Dead Weather side-project, largely because of the dual vocals and keening harmonies of guitarist Russell Marsden and bassist Emma Richardson. Short on spectacle, they are a decidedly hirsute trio: one suspects that only biology prevents Richardson from growing a bushy beard to match Marsden and drummer Matt Hayward. Their gnarly blues is taut and efficient, and Marsden unfurls an impressive variety of sledgehammer riffs, but as yet they lack the alchemy to lift them above the ordinary.

      "bodyText": "Violence is not always physical. The most serious sexual assault I have ever experienced began with a wolf whistle. My perpetrator thought that both his whistle, and what he did to me after that (which definitely was physical), were equally permissible. Whether it's leering, catcalls, shouts or whispers from strangers, defending this behaviour is a gateway to the cultural acceptance of much more serious crimes across the spectrum of gender-based violence. Dismiss the smaller issues, and the bigger issues go unchallenged too. It's hard for some people to get their heads around, especially those who have never experienced it, but these seemingly harmless interactions with strangers on the street can build up a well of resentment, internalised shame and guilt in the people who live with them. The same goes for the collective consciousness of millions of sexual assault survivors. Hollaback activists from Mumbai to Mexico believe that any behaviour that stops you from feeling safe in public, even for a moment, is street harassment \u2013 that a \"compliment\", even if well-intended, is only a compliment if it feels good. This is not about being anti-flirting, but there is a huge gulf between paying someone a compliment with courtesy and respect, and invading their personal space or shouting uninvited remarks. Today's formal, albeit theoretical, recognition by David Cameron that all women have the right to live free from violence is obviously a great step forward. However, the UK has had since last May to commit to signing the pledge to criminalise \"verbal, non-verbal or physical\" sexual harassment, one of the commitments in the Council of Europe's convention of violence against women. It only did so after proposing changes that make for chilling reading, including deletion of the term \"right to live free from violence\" and the outright removal of the reference to \"violence against women as a human rights violation\". Precisely what the impact a convention of this kind would mean when stripped of that clause, I'm not sure. On the one day of the year when these issues are given the priority they so desperately need, how will these changes realistically protect women every other day? It speaks volumes that the focus across the media has been in defence of wolf-whistling (\"You women love it really\" is rape culture 101) when this is the least serious of the many offences covered by the convention. The fact that this convention recognises the everyday damage done to women and girls in this way is something Europe should be proud of, but the coalition taking credit for this progressive sweep is difficult to take against a backdrop of massive cuts to both police budgets and women's services in this country. Harassers needn't worry too much that they're going to hear sirens the next time they shout obscenities at a woman, and fears that building sites across the land will now be raided at the first sign of a puckered set of lips are probably unfounded. What this has done is raise the stakes for everyone to examine their own behaviour, like the harasser we heard about last night in a workshop at Queen Mary University, who shouted abuse while carrying his baby girl in his arms. Intervening in a safe and productive way when you see a woman being harassed might just make someone think twice about doing it again. So many of the crucial care, shelter, advocacy and counselling services for survivors of all forms of sexual violence across the country are now teetering on the brink. The next step in Cameron's worthy crusade should undoubtedly be a full investigation into how we safeguard women's services, lest the state itself become guilty of precisely what this convention seeks to prevent. There is no reason that sexual harassment in the street should be any more permissible than racist language. We can change attitudes, with or without the government, and we will. \u2022 Julia Gray, co-director of Hollaback London, helped writing this article",

It speaks volumes that the focus across the media has been <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9130864/Wolf-whistling-could-be-made-illegal-under-new-European-convention.html\" title=\"\">in defence of wolf-whistling</a> (\"You women love it really\" is <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2009/10/rape-culture-101.html\" title=\"\">rape culture 101</a>) when this is the least serious of the many offences covered by the convention.</p> <p>The fact that this convention recognises the everyday damage done to women and girls in this way is something Europe should be proud of, but the coalition taking credit for this progressive sweep is difficult to take against a backdrop of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jan/31/cuts-women-services-domestic-violence\" title=\"\">massive cuts</a> to both police budgets and women's services in this country.</p> <p>Harassers needn't worry too much that they're going to hear sirens the next time they shout obscenities at a woman, and fears that building sites across the land will now be raided at the first sign of a puckered set of lips are probably unfounded.</p> <p>What this has done is raise the stakes for everyone to examine their own behaviour, like the harasser we heard about last night in a workshop at Queen Mary University, who shouted abuse while carrying his baby girl in his arms. Intervening in a safe and productive way when you see a woman being harassed might just make someone think twice about doing it again.</p> <p>So many of the crucial care, shelter, advocacy and counselling services for survivors of all forms of sexual violence across the country are now teetering on the brink. The next step in Cameron's worthy crusade should undoubtedly be a full investigation into how we safeguard women's services, lest the state itself become guilty of precisely what this convention seeks to prevent. There is no reason that sexual harassment in the street should be any more permissible than racist language. We can change attitudes, with or without the government, and we will.</p> <p>\u2022 Julia Gray, co-director of <a href=\"http://ldn.ihollaback.org/\" title=\"\">Hollaback London</a>, helped writing this article</p>",

      "bodyText": "Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus mesonauta (protonym, Pha\u00ebthon aethereus), Linnaeus, 1758, also known as the short-tailed tropicbird or as the boatswain bird, photographed resting on the deck of a yacht (or, more likely, a dingy?) near Floreana Island, Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago, Ecuador (South America). Image: Nick Athanas/Tropical Birding, 24 November 2008 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Canon EOS 50D Question: The previous few mystery birds have been challenging to identify, so this one will be easy. This Ecuadorian mystery bird has no sister species, although it and its relatives have taught scientists a thing or two about evolutionary relationships. What was the result of that lesson? And what am I talking about? Can you identify this bird's taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus. The red-billed tropicbird is the largest of the three tropicbirds and it is the least abundant. This species is threatened by introduced mammal pest species such as cats, rats, dogs and humans -- particularly fishermen and tourists, as well as exploitation and development of their habitat. Currently, the world's population of these birds is estimated to number roughly 7500 individuals. The red-billed tropicbird is easy to identify from its white underparts, elongated and tapering white wings with contrasting black tips, the bold black stripe through its dark eyes, the fine black vermiculations on its white upperparts (visible only close up), its heavy slightly decurved crimson beak, and its wedge-shaped tail with two extremely elongated central tail feathers. Both male and female have these long white tail streamers, although the male's are usually longer. Juvenile birds have a yellow beak and lack the tail streamers. The red-billed tropicbird has an extremely large range, being highly pelagic and dispersive, and they are found throughout tropical marine areas in much of the world. They fly energetically high above the water, hunting for squid and fish by plunge-diving. Here's a short video of red-billed tropicbirds in flight: Visit davidcaro79's YouTube channel [video link]. Red-billed tropicbirds are particularly fond of flying fish, which are captured on the wing as the fish fly above the water's surface. These graceful birds are clumsy and helpless on land, and slowly push themselves along on their belly using their wings and feet. Red-billed tropicbirds nest in holes or beneath rocks in cliffs on small, remote oceanic islands. They lay a single egg. There are three species of tropicbirds, all placed into the genus, Phaethon, which is placed into the family, Phaethontidae. Although the tropicbirds are probably distant relatives to Procellariiformes (albatross, shearwaters and storm-petrels), their relationships with other taxa are unclear, and it is likely that they have no close relatives, except each other. Within their taxon, the red-tailed and white-tailed tropicbirds are sister species -- each other's closest relatives -- leaving the red-billed tropicbird more distant from them, as their closest living relative. Traditionally, the tropicbirds were placed into Pelecaniformes; the pelicans, cormorants and shags, darters, gannets and boobies and frigatebirds. But then Sibley &amp; Ahlquist came along goobered things up by merging Pelecaniformes and several other taxa into a really large \"Ciconiiformes\". This messy taxonomic blob is now known to be a massively paraphyletic tangle that is missing some closer relatives whilst including more distant relatives. After that massive cock-up, the entire mess was split again, and the three tropicbirds have been removed into their own special little taxonomic order, Phaethontiformes.

The consumer watchdog has not asked the European commission for a UK review of the proposed \u00a3172.5m acquisition of bmi by International Airlines Group, in a move that eliminates a hurdle to the transaction. However, Ryanair's chief executive has objected to the decision because the OFT is still pursuing an investigation of his airline's purchase of a 29.8% stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus. O'Leary accused the organisation of acting inconsistently. \"You have the number one [BA] and number two holder of slots at Heathrow, where there is a huge shortage of slots, merging together and the OFT says it's okay,\" said O'Leary, adding that he did not understand why the acquisition of a stake in Aer Lingus five years ago is the subject of a probe. \"The OFT wants to investigate that issue five years after the event but lo and behold when the merger of Heathrow's two largest airlines happens, they don't object.\" Sir Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Atlantic, has also criticised the bmi deal, warning that it will lead to higher prices for passengers flying to and from Heathrow. Ryanair has taken legal action to argue that the OFT's window for investigating the Aer Lingus deal has expired. It fears that the watchdog will refer the Aer Lingus case to the Competition Commission, which could ultimately order Ryanair to sell its stake. Ryanair would face a substantial loss on any sale, having bought much of its stake when its rival was valued at more than \u20ac2 per share compared with \u20ac0.87 now. O'Leary indicated that the commission would not order the low-cost carrier to divest its stake if it was to scrutinise the shareholding, even though Brussels regulators have warned that a merged Ryanair and Aer Lingus would be anti-competitive. \"If they [the commission] are best placed to deal with the merger of two British airlines why are they not best placed to deal with the merger of Irish airlines?\" The OFT declined to comment.",

But Richard Nelson's extraordinary play about the pioneering playwright-director Harley Granville Barker combines a command of realistic detail with a sense of suffering and loss that genuinely evokes the Russian master. As in many of his previous plays, such as Some Americans Abroad, Nelson deals with cultural collision. In this instance, Granville Barker finds himself in Williamstown, Massachusetts, in 1916, surrounded by a group of English refugees. Disillusioned with English theatre, and with his marriage to Lillah McCarthy on the rocks, the great man is making a living by lecturing on the college circuit. This brings him into contact not only with fellow exiles, including a Dickensian recitalist and a love-struck female actor, but also with the deeply poisonous politics of American campus life. At one point, Granville Barker dreams of writing a non-Aristotelian play in which there wouldn't be any \"doing\", only \"being\". And, in many respects, that is just what Nelson himself has created. There is not a lot of plot: simply a mesmerising record of a group of people all in flight from their own unhappiness. Granville Barker, you feel, is not just escaping London theatre, but also his traumatic memories of a European war to which he was sent to write about the Red Cross. Beatrice, the ex-pat actor, is likewise trying to get away from a doomed marriage by having a passionate affair with an undergraduate. As the twinkling Dickensian points out, they all treat America as if it were a Shakespearean forest that could transform their lives. It may not quite do that but, as Nelson artfully suggests, it does temporarily restore Granville Barker's faith in his chosen medium. Roger Michell's exquisite production also fulfils the play's mission of interesting us in characters because of who they are as much as what they do. Ben Chaplin has just the right air of thwarted idealism as Granville Barker: a man whose life was wrecked, according to one biographer, by British indifference to the need for a national theatre. Jason Watkins as the peripatetic Dickensian burying his sadness under a Pickwickian exterior and Tara Fitzgerald as the hopelessly lovelorn Beatrice are also first-rate. And although Jemma Redgrave, as the widowed manager of the Williamstown boardinghouse, spends much of her time laying and clearing tables, everything she does reveals her unhappiness in a way that Chekhov would have approved.",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations humanitarian chief, Lady Amos, said she was shocked by the devastation she witnessed on a visit to Baba Amr, the suburb of the Syrian city of Homs that has suffered a month-long siege. Amos, who visited Baba Amr on Wednesday for 45 minutes, was speaking on Thursday after meeting ministers in the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, who permitted her to visit Syria and Homs after weeks of refusing her access. She said: \"The devastation there is significant. Part of Homs is completely destroyed and I am concerned to know what has happened to the people who live in that part of the city.\" Amos is the first senior international figure to visit Baba Amr since the Syrian government launched an assault against its opponents. Her visit comes on the eve of the mission to Syria by Kofi Annan, the joint UN and Arab League envoy who will also raise international concerns about the escalating bloodshed. Rebel fighters fled Homs a week ago after nearly a month of shelling by government forces. Annan said he would call for a ceasefire and the opening of negotiations for a political transition when he arrives in Damascus on Saturday. Speaking in Cairo, he said: \"As I move to Syria, we will do whatever we can to urge and press for a cessation of hostilities and end to the killing and violence. But, of course, ultimately the solution lies in a political settlement. \"We will be urging the government and a broad spectrum of Syrian opposition to come together to work with us to find a solution that will respect the aspirations of the Syrian people.\" His comments came as Syria's deputy oil minister announced his defection, making himthe highest ranking official to abandon Assad's regime since the country's uprising erupted a year ago. But the defection of Abdo Hussameldin, a relatively minor and unknown figure outside of Damascus, underscores the difficulties Syria's fragmented opposition has had in persuading senior regime figures to abandon Assad. He said he was joining the rebels because of the \"brutal\" crackdown on dissent that has claimed the lives of thousands of Syrians. \"I join the revolution of this dignified people,\" he said in a YouTube video, the authenticity of which could not be confirmed. William Hague, the foreign secretary, said the UK had no plans to support Syrian rebels, despite comments from the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, who said the Obama administration was considering \"an array of non-lethal assistance\". In evidence to the foreign affairs select committee, Hague said Britain would only continue to supply non-lethal assistance to peaceful opposition outside Syria. \"I haven't ruled out giving more non-lethal help,\" Hague told MPs, \"but we haven't countenanced doing that beyond groups that are so far located outside Syria and are trying to pursue a peaceful democratic opposition.\" The visit by Amos came as Syrian Arab Red Crescent aid workers entered Baba Amr to find it empty of its residents. Syrian state television broadcast footage on Thursday of UN workers in blue bulletproof vests and helmets, which the presenter said was Amos's team in Baba Amr, taking photos of their crumbling surroundings. Syria initially refused to grant Amos access to the country but relented after its allies Russia and China joined the rest of the UN security council in rebuking it. Amos met the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, on Wednesday and an aide said he told her she would be able to go anywhere in Syria she wished to. Amos's goal is to secure access for aid organisations, which have been barred from the heaviest conflict zones. The UN estimates that more than 7,500 civilians have been killed in the government's year-long crackdown on the anti-Assad uprising around the country, while the Syrian government says more than 2,000 members of the army and security forces have been killed in armed attacks.",

Little did we know, as we wound our way out of adolescence into extended adolescence, that Hollywood was dragging us into the gutter. At least, that's the colourful interpretation of a new study by scientists in Germany, who recently found that teens exposed to movies featuring alcohol consumption are more likely to drink to excess themselves. 16,000 students aged 10 to 19 from state schools in Scotland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland were quizzed on their movie watching habits by Reiner Hanewinkel and colleagues from the Institute for Therapy and Health Research in Kiel. When matched up with the same teens' drinking habits the researchers found that those who had watched scenes featuring alcohol use were 14% per cent more likely to drink (rising from 11% to 25%), and 9% more likely to binge drink (rising from 4% to 13%). \"We did not expect this clear finding, but it shows how influential media are in a young person's life,\" said Hanewinkel when he talked to CNN about what seems to be a clear case of monkey see, monkey booze. \"Hollywood blockbusters are distributed worldwide, and they have an impact not only on US teens but also abroad.\" So what's the solution?

      "bodyText": "York is the perfect transvestite city, with a masculine history (those thin statues on the gates were used to show traitor's heads) and a feminine beauty in the graceful buildings and radiant white limestone. It is also very good at promoting itself, which is why it is the subject of our special post to mark International Women's Day. Alone among the gender-balanced, enlightened and progressive cities in the north, it has had the nous to get in touch. This is what Coun Sonja Crisp, Cabinet member for leisure, culture and social inclusion, has to say, and it's a proud boast: The population of York is more female than elsewhere in the region \u2013 67 per cent of residents aged between 16-64 are women, compared to 64 per cent in Yorkshire and the Humber. Also: Significantly more women than the UK average are in employment in the city - 72 per cent of women are in work in York compared to 69.9 per cent in the UK. Fewer women in York are also unemployed than across the region and nationally - the level is 1.6 per cent in the city compared to 3 per cent regionally and 2.6 per cent nationally. Young women excel at school as well, with 65 per cent of them leaving secondary education with 5+ good GCSEs, including Maths and English.

One of the biggest causes of violent crime in this city is still domestic violence against women.

      "bodyText": "Nicolas Sarkozy's millionaire wife, Carla Bruni, has sparked mirth among political opponents by insisting the couple are modest, simple folk. The French president, lagging in the polls behind the socialist frontrunner, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has attempted to re-style himself as a man of the people, but is struggling to escape the perception that he is \"President of the Rich\", unpopular for his outlandish shows of bling and accused by the left of lavishing tax breaks on the wealthy while neglecting the concerns of everyday people. Questioned over his ostentatious 2007 election victory celebrations at the Champs-Elys\u00e9es restaurant, Fouquets, and on a billionaire businessman's yacht, Sarkozy this week blamed the breakdown of his second marriage to C\u00e9cilia Sarkozy. He said he had made the errors of judgment because his mind was on trying to save his marriage from \"exploding\". He added: \"This time I've got a solid family.\" Bruni, Sarkozy's third wife, who is increasingly present at political rallies and TV appearances, then expressed annoyance that her husband was questioned over a love of wealth, exclaiming to le Monde: \"We're modest people.\" The boast of humility from Bruni, an Italian-born multi-millionaire heiress who at the height of her supermodel fame made \u00a34.7m a year, caused eyebrows to be raised among political journalists and those on the political left. After marrying the president, Bruni posed for Vanity Fair in a haute-couture ball-gown on the Elys\u00e9e palace roof, but the couple prefer to live in her vast mansion in a gated community in the west of Paris. The interior minister, Claude Gu\u00e9ant, then stepped in, saying Sarkozy lived a life of \"extreme austerity\", that his only leisure activity was the occasional DVD and that he rarely had friends to dinner. In extracts from a new book on political partners published on Thursday, Bruni was said to be happiest sitting at home wearing a tracksuit. In a recent PR exercise to show how ordinary the presidential couple are, Bruni told a TV magazine she liked to sit on the sofa watching soap operas and the French equivalent of Pop Idol, despite Sarkozy vaunting a new-found love of watching DVDs of European arthouse films. In his latest TV appearance, Sarkozy, who is hoping to kick-start his re-election campaign with a vast rally on the edge of Paris on Sunday, said being \"candidate of the people\" didn't mean trying to make people believe you lived their life. He said it wasn't about \"putting on a cap or playing the accordion\" but talking the \"language\" of the people. Bruni's high-profile presence on the campaign trail has thrown the role of French first lady back into the spotlight. Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, the journalist partner of Hollande, took to her Twitter account to vent her anger at her employer, the magazine Paris Match, for not alerting her that it was running a front cover and long report entitled \"Val\u00e9rie: Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's charming asset\". She tweeted: \"Bravo to Paris Match for its sexism on this day of women's rights\" \u2013 a reference to international women's day. The magazine replied on Twitter that it hadn't consulted her on the cover in order maintain journalistic independence. Hollande, who has four children with the former Socialist presidential candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, met Trierweiler during her decades as a political journalist covering the Socialist party. Trierweiler, who has an office in Hollande's campaign headquarters and is present in the audience at his rallies, has given up political journalism for the duration of the campaign and no longer takes part in decision-making meetings at Paris Match. But she continues to write on the arts and fronts a culture show on a cable TV channel which is owned by the billionaire Vincent Bollor\u00e9. The same businessman also owned the yacht Sarkozy famously borrowed for his flashy holidays, and the president recently tried to deflect criticism from himself by raising the issue of Trierweiler working for the Bollor\u00e9 group. She shot back on Twitter that Sarkozy didn't know what an independent journalist was. Hollande said Sarkozy's targeting of his partner in the campaign was \"inelegant\". A Paris Match poll on Thursday found that Hollande and Trierweiler were France's preferred presidential couple, with 40%, ahead of the Sarkozys on 26%.",

      "bodyText": "The World Bank now has its first contested race for the president of the institution in 68 years. Economist Jeffrey Sachs has thrown his hat into the ring, and as of this week has been officially nominated by the governments of Kenya, Malaysia, Jordan, and East Timor. This is good news for the World Bank and the world, since the bank has considerable influence in developing countries, especially poor ones, and is badly in need of reform. Sachs is facing an uphill battle: this is an election year, and some of the corporations who make millions off the bank are also contributors to US political campaigns. President Obama has strong personal and political incentives to do what all his predecessors have done, and appoint a crony who will keep these people happy. The outgoing president, Robert Zoellick, was a former US trade representative and also worked for \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Goldman Sachs. For an example of how badly the World Bank can get things wrong, and the consequences, consider this: for about 15 years, the bank made loan agreements to poor countries that required them to charge \"user fees\" for primary healthcare and education. Not surprisingly, this practice ended up denying a lot of poor people these essential government services, especially elementary school children in Africa. Then, in 2000, a coalition of about 120 organizations went to the US Congress and got a law passed that the US representative at the bank and other international financial institutions had to oppose such conditions. It took some follow-up: the US government broke the law, supporting such fees in a loan agreement with Tanzania. But someone leaked the World Bank board meeting minutes and they were caught, leading to another congressional hearing and, finally, an end to this terrible practice. The New York Times reported in 2004 that the Bank's policy change had brought millions of kids to primary school in Africa. My colleague Robert Naiman, then at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, was deeply involved in this effort and we were very glad to have helped win something that made such a difference in so many people's lives. But it was also a battle that should have never occurred. And with better leadership at the bank, as well as more transparency, it wouldn't have been necessary. The World Bank also has serious problems with its research. A panel of economists established by the bank itself to evaluate its research for 1998-2005 offered \"substantial criticisms of the way that this research was used to proselytize on behalf of bank policy, often without taking a balanced view of the evidence, and without expressing appropriate skepticism\". But even this review treaded lightly, and ignored some of the worst flaws in bank research. In 2003, the World Bank published a report that was timed to get maximum press on the eve of a key US congressional vote on the Central America Free Trade Agreement (Cafta) and for the tenth anniversary of Nafta (the North American Free Trade Agreement). It claimed to show that Nafta had a positive influence on Mexico's growth rate (which had been, and remains, dismal since the agreement). But the result was shown to be dependent on a data error. The bank refused to correct this error or even address it, after it was repeatedly and clearly demonstrated in correspondence. To me, this was a serious breach of the ethics of scholarship. A lot of the damage that the bank does is by teaming up with the IMF to enforce the fund's conditionalities on spending and macroeconomic policy. Although this \"creditors' cartel\" has broken down in most middle-income countries, which have decided in the past 15 years never to borrow from the fund again, it is still in effect in many poor countries. New leadership at the bank could pull the institution away from enforcing harmful practices. It could also have some impact on the bank's increasing role in climate change policy: a report last year from a coalition of environmental groups, including the US Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, concluded that \"nearly half of [the bank's] energy lending \u2013 more than $15bn \u2013 [went] to fossil fuels in the last four years.\" Clearly, the bank's priorities should be to promote renewable energy such as solar and wind, as well as energy efficiency. The bank could also play a positive role by increased financing of urgent development needs such as health, education, and sustainable agriculture. In these areas, Jeffrey Sachs has a proven track record over the past decade. He has played an important role in supporting the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has saved millions of lives in poor countries. His Millennium Villages project has also provided a significant positive example of how development aid can be used to boost agricultural productivity and health outcomes. This is an important refutation of the widespread cynicism that helps limit the financing of real, positive development aid. Sachs has also been a strong advocate for debt cancellation in poor countries. His 2008 book Common Wealth provides one of the best overviews of the interrelated problems of climate change, development, poverty, population and health \u2013 as well as a set of concrete proposals for addressing them. This is clearly someone who has the knowledge, ideas, and experience to lead the bank in a different direction. He has also been a strong advocate of debt cancellation for poor countries. As Sachs noted last week: \"US officials have traditionally viewed the World Bank as an extension of United States foreign policy and commercial interests. \u2026 Many projects have catered to US corporate interests rather than to sustainable development.\" In the past four decades, just three small countries (Botswana, the Maldives and Cape Verde) have moved up from the UN category of least developed countries. Part of the reason for this lack of progress is the rich countries' domination of the international economic order and rules of the game, which makes it difficult for developing countries at all levels \u2013 but especially the poorer ones \u2013 to pursue the development strategies that would move them up the income ladder. A change in leadership at the World Bank won't remove these structural obstacles. But it could make the World Bank less a part of the problem, and some of its projects more a part of the solution.",

It could also have some impact on the bank's increasing role in climate change policy: <a href=\"http://www.foe.org/news/news-releases/2011-11-civil-society-to-world-bank-clean-up-dirty-energy\">a report last year from a coalition of environmental groups</a>, including the US Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, concluded that \"nearly half of [the bank's] energy lending \u2013 more than $15bn \u2013 [went] to fossil fuels in the last four years.\" Clearly, the bank's priorities should be to promote renewable energy such as solar and wind, as well as energy efficiency.</p> <p>The bank could also play a positive role by increased financing of urgent development needs such as health, education, and sustainable agriculture. In these areas, Jeffrey Sachs has a proven track record over the past decade. He has played an important role in supporting the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/\">Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria</a>, which has saved millions of lives in poor countries. His Millennium Villages project <a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2416&amp;title=beyond-village-transition-rural-investments-national-plans-reach-mdgs-sustaining-scaling-up-millennium-villages\">has also provided a significant positive example</a> of how development aid can be used to boost agricultural productivity and health outcomes. This is an important refutation of the widespread cynicism that helps limit the financing of real, positive development aid. </p> <p>Sachs has also been a strong advocate for debt cancellation in poor countries. <a href=\"http://www.sachs.earth.columbia.edu/commonwealth/index.php\">His 2008 book Common Wealth</a> provides one of the best overviews of the interrelated problems of climate change, development, poverty, population and health \u2013 as well as a set of concrete proposals for addressing them. This is clearly someone who has the knowledge, ideas, and experience to lead the bank in a different direction. He has also been a strong advocate of debt cancellation for poor countries. <a href=\"http://me.aljazeera.net/?name=aj_standard_en&amp;i=8888&amp;section_name=in_depth_opinion&amp;guid=201222575829192233&amp;showonly=13\">As Sachs noted last week</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"US officials have traditionally viewed the World Bank as an extension of United States foreign policy and commercial interests. \u2026 Many projects have catered to US corporate interests rather than to sustainable development.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In the past four decades, just three small countries (Botswana, the Maldives and Cape Verde) have moved up from the UN category of least developed countries. Part of the reason for this lack of progress is the rich countries' domination of the international economic order and rules of the game, which makes it difficult for developing countries at all levels \u2013 but especially the poorer ones \u2013 to pursue the development strategies that would move them up the income ladder.</p> <p>A change in leadership at the World Bank won't remove these structural obstacles. But it could make the World Bank less a part of the problem, and some of its projects more a part of the solution.</p>",

The choice of applications has never been better. A downside is that the dramatic increase in network usage can have a negative impact on the user experience of connected applications. A good user experience is essential to the success of any application, mobile or otherwise. Mobility introduces additional challenges. For example, making a user wait for a connection while one isn't available would be a poor experience. On the other hand, giving the user other options whilst the connection is unavailable might improve the experience. With increasingly faster networks and faster devices, it is common to see developers assuming that \"anything goes\", in terms of development, as if the power of the network and device were unlimited or approaching that of desktop environments. This isn't the case. App users are a lot more sensitive to a poor experience on mobile devices and are a lot less forgiving. Developers should pay attention to all aspects of the application design that will have a positive or negative impact on the user experience, which includes thinking about the network connection. Network-friendly design is a principle of being a good \"network citizen\". Connected applications share the same network resources as other connected applications in a given geographical area (ie within the coverage area of a mobile cell). The behaviour of one connected application can impact other connected apps within the same geographic area. Whether you are using a DSL, fibre, LAN or mobile networks, each of these networks has different characteristics for maximum throughput, end-to-end delay (latency), signalling overheads and available capacity. Developers could just ignore these characteristics and hope for the best, but delivering an optimum experience for users (the people that matter the most) requires that they understand these characteristics and build the intelligence into their applications to accommodate them. It's also worth remembering that mobile operators across the world are gradually switching to \"data caps\" - ie maximum megabytes per day or month. This places a responsibility on developers to optimise application traffic volumes. Every MB saved is a direct saving from the customer's usage bundle.

      "bodyText": "Hometown: Bristol. The lineup: Danny Coughlan (vocals, guitar). The background: Danny Coughlan as Crybaby is an astonishingly fully formed version of the artist he obviously set out to be. He is so successful at being the heartbroken crooner of his childhood dreams, the one in thrall to the music of the era between the twin reigns of Elvis and the Beatles, to the twisted productions of Phil Spector and Joe Meek, to early soul, the stoic balladry of Roy Orbison and the notion of doomed romance, that it almost obviates comment, let alone critique. He is so precisely the sum of his obsessions we are almost rendered speechless. Almost, but not quite. Of course, Richard Hawley and Morrissey have covered this territory before. In fact, Coughlan's voice is uncannily Hawleyish while his songs, all superbly orchestrated and slow, evoke a world in which the Smiths only wrote sepulchral ballads, not jaunty ones about vicars in tutus. Many of them recall Strangeways-era Smiths, and songs such as I Won't Share You, but that's about the only \"modern\" (ie non-60s) reference that springs to mind listening to Crybaby's eponymous debut album, apart from Hawley, but \u2013 like Coughlan \u2013 he's so steeped in his influences and mired in the past it barely makes sense to consider him a contemporary act at all. Produced by Chris Hughes \u2013 the Merrick in Adam Ant's immortal \"Marco, Merrick, Terry-Lee, Gary Tibbs and yours tru-lee\" \u2013 Crybaby is, as Coughlan puts it, \"a tribute, a love letter\" to his favourite old records, \"the sort that were full of songs that had insights into love and life and romance, but never in a chocolate-box way\", records furthermore that addressed his favourite topics: \"Love and pain \u2026 attraction, heartbreak, sorrow.\" Coughlan uses a lot of words to express the rapture of sadness. His first single, for example, bears a typically windy title: I Cherish the Heartbreak More Than the Love That I Lost, a paraphrase of that old Woody Allen chestnut about unrequited love being the only love that lasts. Elsewhere, there are When the Lights Go Out, We're Supposed to Be in Love and What Am I Supposed to Do Without You Now? You can imagine Coughlan making great play of the dearth today of wordsmiths and lovers of language, compared to the last golden age of literate verbosity when the likes of Morrissey \u2013 and Elvis Costello, and Paddy McAloon, and Martin Fry \u2013 used whole libraries of clever similes and metaphors to describe the ups and downs of love. He might be right to do so. If the imagery and the arrangements \u2013 all of it, really \u2013 are filched, it's still entertaining, and occasionally moving as hell, even if you feel as though your emotions are being piqued by the ersatz, replicas of beauty. These are bona fide neo-classics, classy and classically structured \u2013 Coughlan has studied well, right down to the swooning vocal delivery and elisions of vowels, which are pure Moz. Armies of Darkness recalls Otis at his most blue. This Time It's Over conflates the work of his two idols \u2013 It's Over and I Know It's Over \u2013 so faithfully you feel like shouting, Stop him if you think you've heard this one before! Shame and Twist of The Knife both feature Be My Baby drums and you fear he's running out of ideas, but the penultimate pair, Veils and A Misery of Love, are so successfully forlorn in that Moz-does-Roy way, you can only applaud his mastery and, well, gall. The buzz: \"An entirely appropriate pseudonym for this creator of beautifully miserable tunes\" \u2013 Amazing Blog. The truth: Meet Boy Orbison. Most likely to: Want the one he can't have. Least likely to: Do a cover of Ant Rap. What to buy: Crybaby is released on 9 April by Helium, preceded by the single I Cherish the Heartbreak More Than the Love That I Lost, out now.

The frivolity in that taunt has receded as analysts examine the possibilities. Supporters now hear people well acquainted with the financial crisis at their Glasgow rivals speaking even of liquidation and the re-emergence of a new Rangers that would have to fight its way back up from the lower divisions. Were that to happen, the consequence would be felt by everyone in Scottish football. Celtic's chief executive, Peter Lawwell, was bound to state that his club was not dependent on Rangers. Yet his stadium would no longer be packed if Scottish Premier League titles became a foregone conclusion \u2013 given that the remaining clubs are too small and lacking in revenue to pose a sustained threat. There are deeper if more subtle ramifications. It should always be remembered that the term Old Firm began as a well-aimed jibe at the fact that supposed foes were truly business partners. Their feud made for excellent box office. The relationship between the fans themselves has never been as cosy as that, and the sectarian divisions remain as deep as ever, reaching beyond Glasgow. In Lanarkshire, for instance, Coatbridge is considered a Catholic and Celtic homeland, while Protestant Larkhall is for Rangers. This remains true regardless of the decline in churchgoing. Celtic fans have a habit of defining themselves as Irish republicans and once sang of the bomb on Lord Mountbatten's boat that killed him in 1979. Rangers, with their union flags, prize the status quo. Considering that it is the Scottish Nationalist Alex Salmond who holds sway as Scotland's first minister, it would be wise to doubt whether the common characterisation of Old Firm fans is to be taken at face value. If they loathe one another it is a question of animosity between tribes rather than a matter of principle. On occasion, that mood paves the way for tragedy. In 1995, a young Celtic fan called Mark Scott was stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack as he walked past a pub associated with Rangers fans. His friend then started an anti-sectarian charity, Nil by Mouth. In 1996, Celtic launched their Bhoys Against Bigotry campaign. At that time, Rangers declined to start a parallel project \u2013 they felt the problem could be dealt with in a low-profile manner \u2013 but in 2003 they launched their Pride over Prejudice initiative. The Ibrox disaster of 1971, when 66 people died in a crush on the stairs at an Old Firm game, gave rise to some empathy between the two sets of fans, but that feeling has not lasted. The positions adopted by supporters can be pushed to extremes as each set strives to emphasise that there can be no common ground with the other. At a match in 2010, a week before Remembrance Sunday, some Celtic fans unveiled a banner directed at the armed forces: \"Your deeds would shame all the devils in hell. Ireland, Iraq, Afghanistan. No bloodstained poppy on our hoops.\" Presumably there was no space left for even a footnote on the conquest of fascism in Britain's military history. Should Rangers be demoted to a lower division because of their financial crisis it would restore some prominence to, say, Aberdeen, but that club would still have no prospect of a return to the greatness of 1983, when they defeated Real Madrid to take the European Cup Winners' Cup. In those times players remained the property of the club even when their contracts had expired. Celtic and, until the current plight, Rangers are now the only clubs in Scotland to spend anything more than a modest sum on players, yet it is rare for either to make an impact in European competition. If the crowds have continued to roll in, it is partly because non-attendance would be a sign of weakness in the vendetta. Rangers' plight could all the same be a new beginning in which fans realise that they cannot afford to be onlookers. The rescue could yet involve the supporters combining to take a stake in a new Rangers, so giving themselves the task of looking after their club as well as watching the team. The current torment would thus ensure that Rangers are better protected by future generations of fans. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

Last night I attended the launch of the UK's first 'angel network' dedicated to businesses that create positive social change, Clearly So Angels, at the Houses of Parliament. At the Terrace Pavilion, the wine flowed, canap\u00e9s were served, and a group of 'angels', along side a few social entrepreneurs, listened to why angels should be investing in social enterprises. Rodney Schwartz from ClearlySo described its role as accelerating capital into extraordinary businesses and talked about the benefits of a network, sharing expertise concerning impact investment and sharing risk. At the event, social impact angels were described as being patient with capital, whilst impatient for success, and as having a bias for action and a tolerance for risk. One interesting suggestion from a social impact angel was that they understand you can't measure everything that's important. Are these social impact angels prepared to take a long-term view and accept an element of social return that can't be easily measured? If so, the question is whether there are enough out there to fill the gap the banks have left. As someone starting their own social enterprise, from babies with love, I believe social enterprises can deliver financial and social returns at the same time and that good social entrepreneurs can demonstrate this. However, the social impact angels may need to accept non-traditional metrics they might not be familiar with, but that work in a social context. For example, at from babies with love, we are donating 100% profit to charities supporting orphaned and abandoned children. We can count the profit, we can count the children, but quantifying the real impact on their quality of life is going to be hard to capture in numbers alone. The audience seemed to regard themselves as people with social awareness. Though looking for a financial return, they are prepared to mix commercial and social objectives. No doubt many of them are hard-nosed people, but the golden halos were there and I felt there was a real appetite to invest. So perhaps, and hopefully, they will make a significant contribution to financing the social enterprise sector. And so, a call to us, the social entrepreneurs, to present ourselves at the gates of financial heaven and to meet the angels!

      "bodyText": "The court of appeal has quashed the murder convictions of five men convicted of a gangland killing after hearing of failures to reveal potentially crucial evidence to the defence. The five men were serving life sentences totalling a minimum of 135 years for the 2002 murder of Kevin Nunes, who was taken to a country lane and shot dead in a drugs feud. Concerns over the case led to four police chiefs being placed under criminal investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, as revealed by the Guardian last year. The prosecution case was left so flawed after revelations about disclosure that the Crown Prosecution Service did not oppose the convictions being overturned in court on Thursday, nor did they seek a retrial of the five men. Richard Whittam QC told the court of appeal that the \"CPS does not seek to uphold the convictions in this case, nor does it apply for any defendant to be retried\". Lord Justice Hooper, Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Stadlen overturned the convictions after hearing of \"failures\" in disclosure of material to the defence relating to the key prosecution witness. The quashing of the convictions follows an investigation by the criminal cases review commission into disclosure issues in the case. The CCRC delivered a 247-page report outlining their concerns to the court of appeal in mid-December. Levi Walker, from Birmingham, Adam Joof, from Willenhall, West Midlands, Antonio Christie, from Great Bridge, West Midlands, Michael Osbourne and Owen Crooks, both from Wolverhampton, were found guilty of the crime at Leicester crown court in 2008. They were convicted of the murder of Nunes, 20, who was found dead in a country road in Pattingham, Staffordshire, on 19 September 2002. Nunes, a talented footballer who had been on the books of Tottenham Hotspur, was shot five times. The convictions were gained after one man who was present, Simeon Taylor, gave evidence for the crown. A spokesperson for the IPCC confirmed its investigation into the police chiefs and other officers involved in the original investigation were still ongoing. The four chiefs under investigation are the national lead on ethics in policing, Adrian Lee, who is now the chief constable of Northamptonshire; Suzette Davenport, the deputy chief constable of Northamptonshire; Jane Sawyers, assistant chief constable with the Staffordshire force; and Marcus Beale, assistant chief constable with West Midlands police. The investigation is being carried out by the chief constable of Derbyshire, Mick Creedon, on behalf of the IPCC, which retains control and direction of the inquiry. The men convicted of the murder lodged a challenge to their convictions with the court of appeal, which in turn asked the criminal cases review commission to investigate issues of disclosure in the original trial. The CCRC is the body responsible for investigating alleged miscarriages of justice. The four police chiefs were issued with regulation 14 notices in December, informing them that their conduct was under investigation. At least nine officers were told they were under investigation over the case. The allegations being examined by the IPCC-managed investigation include conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and misconduct in public office. The issuing of notices of investigation into an officer's conduct is not meant to imply any wrongdoing.",

The four chiefs under investigation are the national lead on ethics in policing, Adrian Lee, who is now the chief constable of Northamptonshire; Suzette Davenport, the deputy chief constable of Northamptonshire; Jane Sawyers, assistant chief constable with the Staffordshire force; and Marcus Beale, assistant chief constable with West Midlands police.</p> <p>The investigation is being carried out by the chief constable of Derbyshire, Mick Creedon, on behalf of the IPCC, which retains control and direction of the inquiry.</p> <p>The men convicted of the murder lodged a challenge to their convictions with the court of appeal, which in turn asked the criminal cases review commission to investigate issues of disclosure in the original trial. The CCRC is the body responsible for investigating alleged miscarriages of justice.</p> <p>The four police chiefs were issued with regulation 14 notices in December, informing them that their conduct was under investigation.</p> <p>At least nine officers were told they were under investigation over the case. The allegations being examined by the IPCC-managed investigation include conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and misconduct in public office.</p> <p>The issuing of notices of investigation into an officer's conduct is not meant to imply any wrongdoing.</p>",

Today they are being made available on mobile phones and tablets via a new Guardian crossword app. We have started with a free trial of an app for those of you with Android phones and tablets. (You need Android version 2.1 or later, see more technical specifications here). You will be able to get each new Quick crossword from Monday to Saturday and each new Cryptic crossword from Monday to Friday (though not, at this stage, the Saturday prize puzzles). If you have an Android phone or tablet, you can download the app from Google Play. (The countries where this app is available are listed at our FAQs) As well as the usual interactive tools that you get with puzzles on the website (check, cheat, solutions, etc.) the app lets you pinch, zoom or drag the grid to adjust the focus, while you can still browse the clue list. There is also, for the competitively inclined, a timer that tells you how long you have spent solving each puzzle, even if it takes a few attempts. We shall be using the free trial period to iron out any unforeseen problems and to gauge demand. We may then decide to develop a version of the app for iPhone. During this period the Guardian mobile team would welcome your feedback on any problems you encounter and your suggestions for improvements. You can contact them from the app, or via the Guardian userhelp desk. You can also follow @guardianmobile on Twitter to get details of any updates. If you're having any trouble using the app you might find answers to your questions in our FAQs. This free trial period will probably last about two months. After that, I fear, there will be a charge for using the app. But by then we hope that in your masses you will think that it is worth every penny asked of you. Meanwhile, enjoy!",

      "bodyText": "China has unveiled legislation enshrining police powers to hold people at unknown locations, but has removed a controversial secrecy clause after an outcry. Experts had warned that the original draft would have legalised disappearances by allowing police to hold some suspects for up to six months without informing their families. The revisions to the criminal procedure law were unveiled at the National People's Congress on Thursday, and will be passed by what is essentially a rubber stamp parliament. Lawyers have welcomed other elements offering additional protection to suspects. Reformers have long battled for such measures \u2013 which include improving legal access, increasing protection for juveniles and outlawing evidence gathered through torture \u2013 although many are sceptical about how they will be observed. \"The real issue is not what the laws say, but how they are enforced,\" Pu Zhiqiang, a Beijing lawyer who has taken on sensitive cases such as those involving dissidents, said. \"The pattern is that the Communist party can play by rules when there aren't special circumstances \u2013 but whenever there are special circumstances, it doesn't have to play by them.\" Police later arrived at Pu's office, preventing him from granting further interviews. Many of the dissidents detained in a sweeping crackdown last year, including the artist Ai Weiwei, appear to have been held under \"residential surveillance\" at unknown locations. Some experts believe that is illegal, while others say the existing law does not spell out whether the measure should only apply at someone's usual residence. \"The law has not only not changed to prevent that practice but has embraced it, and that is what I find disturbing,\" Joshua Rosenzweig, an independent human rights researcher in Hong Kong, said. Many of those held last year said they suffered beatings, sleep deprivation and other abuses. The new law states that police have the right to hold suspects or defendants at places other than their home or an official detention centre if they are \"involved in crimes concerning state security, terrorism or especially serious corruption and notification of where they are residing could obstruct investigations\". Experts said that that police would not have to disclose where they were holding suspects, although they believed in theory suspects would have a right to legal access. State security crimes include subversion and other vaguely-worded charges often used against dissidents. But the clause that most alarmed campaigners \u2013 by stating that, in such cases, police did not have to notify families within 24 hours if it could impede the investigation \u2013 has now been removed. \"It makes a world of difference whether you notify people or not,\" Nicholas Bequelin, of Human Rights Watch, said. \"People inside and outside the system have prevented this from being introduced. It was not an easy battle, and it has to be noticed.\" But Rosenzweig said the law was still \"extremely problematic\". He said: \"Detention of this kind was originally intended to be relatively lenient, but I have heard from people held this way that they would rather have been in a jail. \"It is still six months where the police do not have to really justify anything they do to you.\" Wang Songlian, of the Chinese Human Rights Defenders Network, added: \"Detention centres are not pleasant, but they at least have minimum safeguards and standards. \"[With this] there is a high risk of mistreatment and torture over a very long time.\" Chen Guangzhong, a professor at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, who criticised earlier drafts \u2013 including the secrecy clause \u2013 said the revised law marked a necessary curtailment of police powers. \"This change is significant,\" he said. \"It means China is making further effort in improving human rights, democracy and the rule of law. In the past, judicial authorities had too much power.\"",

      "bodyText": "British archaeologists have unearthed a slave burial ground containing an estimated 5,000 bodies on a remote South Atlantic island. The corpses were found on tiny St Helena, 1,000 miles off the coast of south-west Africa. Those who died were slaves taken off the ships of slave traders by the Royal Navy in the 1800s, when Britain was supressing the slavery in the Caribbean. Many of the captives died after being kept on the slavers' ships in appalling conditions, and later in refugee camps when they reached the island. According to Britain's National Archives, between 1808 and 1869 the Royal Navy seized more than 1,600 slave ships and freed about 150,000 Africans. The dig, held in advance of the construction of a new airport on the island, revealed the horrors of the Atlantic slave trade. The Middle Passage was the name of the route taken by ships transporting slaves from Africa to the new world. It was the second leg of a triangular journey undertaken by European ships. The first leg would involve them taking manufactured goods to Africa, which they would trade for slaves. After the Africans were delivered to the West Indies and Brazil (and, until the abolition slavery in 1809, the US), the ships would take raw materials back to Europe. Experts from Bristol University led the dig. One of them, Prof Mark Horton, said: \"Here we have the victims of the Middle Passage \u2013 one of the greatest crimes against humanity \u2013 not just as numbers, but as human beings. \"These remains are certainly some of the most moving that I have ever seen in my archaeological career.\" St Helena was the landing place for many of the slaves taken off slaver ships captured by the navy during the suppression of the trade between 1840 \u2013 when the island became the base for the squadron leading the Royal Navy's offensive against the slavers \u2013 and 1872. About 26,000 freed slaves were brought to the island, with most being landed at a depot in Rupert's Bay. Rupert's Valley \u2013 an arid, shadeless and always windy tract \u2013 was also poorly suited for use as a hospital and refugee camp for such large numbers. The university archaeologists have so far unearthed 325 bodies in individual, multiple and mass graves. They estimate the site contains a total of about 5,000 bodies, but these seem likely to be left where they lie. Horton noted that the archeological excavations cover only the portion of the burial area that would have been disturbed by the new road were investigated. Only five individuals were buried in coffins \u2013 one adolescent and four stillborn or newborn babies. The others had been put directly in shallow graves before being hastily covered. In some cases mothers were buried with their children. Dr Andrew Pearson of the university said 83% of the bodies were those of children, teenagers or young adults. Youngsters were often prime material for slave traders, who sought victims with long potential working lives. Most causes of death could not be established on the bodies as the main killers \u2013 dehydration, dysentery and smallpox \u2013 leave no pathological trace. But experts found scurvy was widespread on the skeletons and several showed indications of violence, including two older children who appeared to have been shot. The team found evidence the victims were from a rich culture, with a strong sense of ethnic and personal identity. A few had managed to retain items of jewellery such as beads and bracelets, despite the physical stripping process that would have taken place after their capture. A number of metal tags were also found on the bodies that would have identified the slaves by name or number. Pearson, the director of the project, said: \"Studies of slavery usually deal with unimaginable numbers, work on an impersonal level and, in so doing, overlook the individual victims. \"In Rupert's Valley, however, the archaeology brings us quite literally face-to-face with the human consequences of the slave trade.\" Excavated artefacts will be transferred to Liverpool for an exhibition at the International Slavery Museum in 2013. The human remains will be re-interred on St Helena. \u2022 This article was corrected and clarified on 12 March 2012. The original referred to slaves \"captured\" by the Royal Navy, who then went on to die \"after being kept on British ships in appalling conditions\". What it meant was slaves from captured slaver ships, where conditions caused many to die at the time or in the ensuing days and weeks. The story also implied that the Bristol University archeologists might be intending to excavate the whole St Helena burial site with its estimated 5,000 bodies. This is not the case.",

      "bodyText": "ROUND 872 (AND COUNTING) The Fiver doesn't know much about navigation, other than several crucial ways of deleting viewing history. But we do know that Mercator projection is considered obsolete and offensive, what with it being the 16th-century technique for representing the globe on a map in such a way as to make Africa and South America much smaller than in reality and Europe much more important. Those maps aren't used much beyond Daily Mail offices any more but a footballing corollary has emerged this season and become irritatingly prominent: Manchester projection, the technique for representing the entire 872-round Europa League knockout process as a preliminary for an all-Manchester final. This is despite the fact that in European competition this season Manchester United have looked about as comfortable as a tipped cow in an abattoir, especially at Old Trafford, where they have won just one of four European ties this season. This will not have escaped the notice of the manager of tonight's visitors, as Athletic Bilbao's Marcelo Bielsa has such a maniacal devotion to detail that he probably knows the precise number of passes that his players need to intercept before Wayne Rooney clatters someone in frustration. \"I've not met Bielsa but I admire his work,\" swooned Euro Vase tyro Lord Ferg. \"He's overseen the emergence of a very good, determined, organised Bilbao side with great belief. We'll have to be strong at the back; if you offered me a 1-0 [win] I'd take it,\" added Ferg, making a declaration that, if it came from Roberto Mancini, would probably be taken as an attempt to solicit a bribe. Mancini, you see, has yet again found himself the subject of hysterical allegations of wrongdoing after he had the temerity to suggest that the Premier League top scorer Robin Van Persie is a very good player whom every club wishes they had. \"I think all the good teams are interested in Van Persie,\" ventured Mancini before dialling 999 to report a case of the bleeding obvious. \"He is a fantastic striker but I think he will remain with Arsenal.\" That has been denounced by some people as an attempt to unsettle the Dutchman, which suggests that some people think Mancini is stupid enough to attempt to unsettle a player in public when he could easily dispatch an envoy to do it much more discreetly \u2013 and effectively \u2013 in private. So let's not talk about that any more. \"I came here five years ago with Inter in Big Cup and we lost,\" declared Mancini on a completely unrelated matter right on cue. \"So I know how tough this match [against Sporting Lisbon in the Euro Vase tonight, in case you were wondering] is going to be.\" QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Evra was clever at Old Trafford. Luis didn't shake his hand because Evra's hand was down there. What else is Luis supposed to do? Would you go to shake someone's hand if their hand is way down there by their side? Course not \u2026 Evra probably stayed up all night thinking about how to do that\" - Glen Johnson heralds another momentous day for the Liverpool PR department. SOMEONE AT STAMFORD BRIDGE NEEDS A NEW SCRIPTWRITER DEPT \"[Big Phil Scolari's] a great man. Unfortunately we weren't playing well and it falls on his head. Maybe they should look at some of us because we did underachieve.\" \"It's sad for Andr\u00e9 because, unfortunately, it falls on his head when I think the players will hold their hands up and say clearly we've not been good enough and we have all made mistakes together.\" England's Brave and Loyal John Terry dusts off his Luis Felipe Scolari sacking statement, changes a few words, and gives it another whirl for Andre Villas-Boas. And while we're at it, here's what the Chelsea press office said about the dimissal of Scolari .. . \"The Chelsea board would like to place on record our gratitude for his time as manager ... we all feel a sense of sadness that our relationship has ended so soon. Unfortunately, the results and performances of the team appeared to be deteriorating at a key time in the season.\" ... and the dimissal of AVB. \"The board would like to record our gratitude for his work and express our disappointment that the relationship has ended so early. Unfortunately the results and performances of the team have not been good enough and were showing no signs of improving at a key time in the season.\" FIVER LETTERS [Tumbleweed] Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you've nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. BITS AND BOBS When George Best whizzed up the wing, trailing a stench of stale booze in his wake, he was called a hero. When Wolves captain Roger Johnson turns up to training allegedly stinking of the stuff, he gets done for breaching club discipline. It's a funny old world. In other drunken-dribbler news: Jermaine Pennant has denied claims he faced the wrath of manager Tony Pulis for gargling Purple Tin until 5am on the day Stoke faced Everton last December. \"I'm all over \u00a3skysports saying I've been fined when it's not true the gaffa is going mad,\" tweeted Pennant. \"So to all the stoke fans and for the record there is no problem with me and TP I have not been fined and we haven't fallen out at all\". Meanwhile TP has backed sulky teenager Andre Villas-Boas to bounce back after his work experience at Chelsea. \"I found him to be a nice chap. I'm sure he will get back into the game and that it will have been a great experience for him,\" he patronised. Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell has been fined \u00a31,500 for effing and jeffing on BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 programme. Peter Lovenkrands could miss the rest of Newcastle's season with knack. \"[He] has really hurt his thigh,\" soothed manager Alan Pardew. In other news, Ryan Taylor has signed a new deal at the club. \"I'm over the moon,\" he said, before Pardew was forced to coax him back down with a stick. Robbie Fowler has turned down the chance to top up his coffers to the tune of \u00a390-a-week after rejecting Blackpool's generous contract offer. And Gary Speed's son Edward has been called up to the Wales Under-16 squad alongside Craig Bellamy's song Ellis. STILL WANT MORE? What, no David Wetherall? Join the chorus of disapproval on our poll: is Lionel Messi the greatest player of all time? Is Athletic Bilbao coach Marcelo Bielsa as loco as they say? No, he's madder says Sid Lowe. Sachin Nakrani heard that six Kopites were running from Hillsborough to Anfield in order to raise awareness of the disaster's 23rd anniversary, so he wrote this blog about it.

      "body": "<h2>ROUND 872 (AND COUNTING)</h2> <p>The Fiver doesn't know much about navigation, other than several crucial ways of deleting viewing history. But we do know that Mercator projection is considered obsolete and offensive, what with it being the 16th-century technique for representing the globe on a map in such a way as to make Africa and South America much smaller than in reality and Europe much more important. Those maps aren't used much beyond Daily Mail offices any more but a footballing corollary has emerged this season and become irritatingly prominent: Manchester projection, the technique for representing the entire 872-round Europa League knockout process as a preliminary for an all-Manchester final.</p> <p>This is despite the fact that in European competition this season Manchester United have looked about as comfortable as a tipped cow in an abattoir, especially at Old Trafford, where they have won just one of four European ties this season. This will not have escaped the notice of the manager of tonight's visitors, as Athletic Bilbao's Marcelo Bielsa has such a maniacal devotion to detail that he probably knows the precise number of passes that his players need to intercept before Wayne Rooney clatters someone in frustration.</p> <p>\"I've not met Bielsa but I admire his work,\" swooned Euro Vase tyro Lord Ferg. \"He's overseen the emergence of a very good, determined, organised Bilbao side with great belief. We'll have to be strong at the back; if you offered me a 1-0 [win] I'd take it,\" added Ferg, making a declaration that, if it came from Roberto Mancini, would probably be taken as an attempt to solicit a bribe. Mancini, you see, has yet again found himself the subject of hysterical allegations of wrongdoing after he had the temerity to suggest that the Premier League top scorer Robin Van Persie is a very good player whom every club wishes they had.</p> <p>\"I think all the good teams are interested in Van Persie,\" ventured Mancini before dialling 999 to report a case of the bleeding obvious. \"He is a fantastic striker but I think he will remain with Arsenal.\" That has been denounced by some people as an attempt to unsettle the Dutchman, which suggests that some people think Mancini is stupid enough to attempt to unsettle a player in public when he could easily dispatch an envoy to do it much more discreetly \u2013 and effectively \u2013 in private. So let's not talk about that any more. \"I came here five years ago with Inter in Big Cup and we lost,\" declared Mancini on a completely unrelated matter right on cue. \"So I know how tough this match [against Sporting Lisbon in the Euro Vase tonight, in case you were wondering] is going to be.\"</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"Evra was clever at Old Trafford. Luis didn't shake his hand because Evra's hand was down there. What else is Luis supposed to do? Would you go to shake someone's hand if their hand is way down there by their side? Course not \u2026 Evra probably stayed up all night thinking about how to do that\" - Glen Johnson heralds another momentous day for the Liverpool PR department.</p> <h2>SOMEONE AT STAMFORD BRIDGE NEEDS A NEW SCRIPTWRITER DEPT</h2> <p>\"[Big Phil Scolari's] a great man. Unfortunately we weren't playing well and it falls on his head. Maybe they should look at some of us because we did underachieve.\"</p> <p>\"It's sad for Andr\u00e9 because, unfortunately, it falls on his head when I think the players will hold their hands up and say clearly we've not been good enough and we have all made mistakes together.\"</p> <p>England's Brave and Loyal John Terry dusts off his Luis Felipe Scolari sacking statement, changes a few words, and gives it another whirl for Andre Villas-Boas.</p> <p>And while we're at it, here's what the Chelsea press office said about the dimissal of Scolari .. .</p> <p>\"The Chelsea board would like to place on record our gratitude for his time as manager ... we all feel a sense of sadness that our relationship has ended so soon. Unfortunately, the results and performances of the team appeared to be deteriorating at a key time in the season.\"</p> <p>... and the dimissal of AVB.</p> <p>\"The board would like to record our gratitude for his work and express our disappointment that the relationship has ended so early. Unfortunately the results and performances of the team have not been good enough and were showing no signs of improving at a key time in the season.\"</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>[Tumbleweed]</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

      "bodyText": "Aviva said it is committed to the UK \"hook, line and sinker\" after it unveiled forecast-beating 2011 profits and became the largest general insurer in Britain. Industry figures show that Aviva has overtaken Direct Line, the recently rebranded insurance division of Royal Bank of Scotland. Shares in Aviva closed up 5.6p at 356.8p. Chief executive Andrew Moss, who took the helm in 2007, highlighted Aviva's UK performance where profits climbed 8% to \u00a31.45bn. It has grabbed a bigger share of the UK life and pensions market, now at 12%. The group also won 400,000 new car insurance customers, taking the total to more than 2 million, after the rollout of direct pricing to brokers and the launch of its quotemehappy website. It still lags behind Admiral, the second-biggest UK car insurer with 2.9 million customers, which reported rising profits on Wednesday, and Direct Line, Britain's No 1 car insurer. Aviva is developing a phone app that could take the place of a telematics black box to reward the more careful drivers by reducing their premiums. Aviva's car premiums rose 13% last year but growth slowed to single digits in the second half. David Barral, chief executive of Aviva's UK Life business, tweeted that Aviva is committed to the UK \"hook, line and sinker\" and has no plans to move its head office. Aviva describes the UK, which contributes nearly half of its profits and where it has 14 million customers, as the cornerstone of its strategy. Prudential said earlier this month it was considering moving its headquarters abroad, because of EU plans to force insurers to hold more capital through regulation known as Solvency II. Aviva, which operates in 21 countries (down from 30 a couple of years ago), beat City forecasts with a 6% rise in operating profits to \u00a32.5bn in 2011 from continued operations. City analysts had pencilled in \u00a32.4bn. Profit before tax slumped to \u00a387m from \u00a32.4bn, including a \u00a3726m loss relating to its Dutch subsidiary Delta Lloyd. Aviva raised the bar again after beating all its operating targets in 2011. Aviva's eurozone debt exposure has fallen to \u00a31.3bn from \u00a31.6bn in 2010, equivalent to 1% of shareholder assets. Aviva has a big business in Italy and Spain, but it has zero exposure to Greece and Portugal and \"very little\" to Ireland, said Aviva's finance chief Pat Regan. \"We're pretty comfortable with that level.\" Moss said conditions in Europe were \"undoubtedly tough\". \"People are still nervous in some of those markets and that will affect sales, of unit-linked products, for example,\" he said. Asked about the eurozone debt crisis, Moss said there had been a \"sea change\" since the European Central Bank started providing more liquidity for banks. \"It's perfectly clear that the politicians have a much better grip on what's happening. There are going to be a few bumps in the road, but overall the trends are towards consensus and agreement.\" Moss said the company would carry on simplifying its portfolio. Last year, it sold the RAC breakdown business for \u00a31bn, further reduced its stake in Delta Lloyd to 43% and offloaded its Czech, Romanian, Hungarian and Slovakian operations. Oriel Securities analyst Marcus Barnard said: \"At first glance a better than expected set of results, with plenty for the bulls and something for the bears.\" He said the dividend had fallen slightly short. Aviva will pay out 26p a share to shareholders, up just 2% from 2010 and below expectations of 26.8p.",

      "bodyText": "No one can begrudge Hiromi Ito the look of pride on his face as he lifts a rope laden with baby scallops from the sea off Ogatsu. A year ago, he watched in horror as \u2013 in a few terrifying minutes \u2013 the tsunami destroyed his village's aquaculture industry, the lifeblood of the local economy. Today, the seascape is improbably idyllic: mountains silhouetted against a pale winter sky, and calm waters where rows of buoys mark the starting point for Ogatsu's renaissance. Back on shore, however, little has changed. The tsunami killed 235 people in Ogatsu and swept away almost all of its buildings. The force of the earthquake nudged the coastline eastward and caused it to sink by about a metre. No construction work will take place here for at least two years, says Ito, while residents decide where, and if, to rebuild. He believes that its best chance of recovery lies in the nutrient-rich waters that made Ogatsu famous for oysters, scallops, sea squirt and salmon: \"I looked at the devastation and decided there and then that we had to build a new kind of business run by fishermen, for fishermen.\" He and 10 other fishermen attracted the interest of restaurant owners and marketers, and Oh Guts \u2013 an English play on the village's name \u2013 was born. Rather than wait for official compensation, the venture sought private investments of 10,000 yen (\u00a378) a share, a scheme Ito says is a first for the Japanese fishing industry. By the end of last year it had sold 20,000 shares, and hopes to reach the 50,000 mark within five years. The money will be used to replace lost boats and equipment; investors, who will be invited to take a hands-on role in cultivation, will be repaid in fresh seafood. Ogatsu's fledgling recovery is being repeated in other parts of Miyagi prefecture, where 9,500 people died and 1,700 are missing. In Higashi Matsushima, 100 fishermen are bringing in hauls of the town's enormous oysters. The famed islands that dot the bay deprived the tsunami of some of its ferocity, but not enough to save the oyster beds. \"We had just finished harvesting that year's oysters, but the tsunami swept away all the seeds for the following year,\" says Masami Hachiya, president of the local fisheries co-operative. \"We had to start from scratch.\" Using seed oysters brought in from outside, the first batches of oysters \u2013 even bigger than usual because there are fewer of them sharing the bay \u2013 are already on sale. \"Production and sales are about half of what they were before the tsunami, but it's just enough for us to make a living,\" Hachiya says, adding that the lucrative clam and whitebait trade would be restarted soon. Progress in Ogatsu is much slower. The post-disaster exodus inland has cut its population from 4,300 to less than 1,000. The number of fishermen, whose average age was over 60 before the disaster, has fallen from 250 to about 40. It will be two years before any oysters reach maturity, and another year before the sea squirts are ready. That said, the company hopes to produce 1.3m kilos of seafood and turn a modest profit by summer 2013. Ogatsu's struggle is being repeated across Japan's north-east, where the tsunami caused 1.2tn yen of damage to the fishing industry. In all, 319 fishing ports and 22,000 fishing boats were damaged and last year's total catch was 60% down on the previous year. The number of fishermen in the region has fallen by a 10th in five years, while only a quarter of those left are below 50. In Miyagi prefecture alone, a third have said they will quit because of the disaster. \"We had to stand up and do it for ourselves,\" says Ito. \"We couldn't wait for the bureaucrats behind their desks to help us. The government has passed three supplementary budgets, but it could be another two years before we receive any compensation. \"The difference between us and the government is that I was directly affected by the disaster. I feel like I've died once already \u2026 I'm not scared of failure any more. I survived, and I want to make the most of the chance I've been given.\" Takashi Tachibana, a food business entrepreneur and a co-founder of Oh Guts, moved from Tokyo to Ogatsu last year to to help market the brand and attract investment. The idea, he says, is for the fishermen to produce, sell and process everything themselves, bypassing the costly and inefficient distribution system many blame for stifling small Japanese fisheries. \"You can feel the energy of the people here,\" says Tachibana. \"Some fishermen may not like the idea of being employed by outsiders, but they will have direct contact with the people who buy their products. That makes a huge difference.\" For Ito, restructuring is a small price to pay for the chance to board his boat and inspect beds teeming with oysters and scallops. \"We don't bear a grudge against the sea,\" he says. \"It took away our living and our loved ones, but now it's beginning to give something back.\"",

In Miyagi prefecture alone, a third have said they will quit because of the disaster. \"We had to stand up and do it for ourselves,\" says Ito. \"We couldn't wait for the bureaucrats behind their desks to help us. The government has passed three supplementary budgets, but it could be another two years before we receive any compensation.</p> <p>\"The difference between us and the government is that I was directly affected by the disaster. I feel like I've died once already \u2026 I'm not scared of failure any more. I survived, and I want to make the most of the chance I've been given.\"</p> <p>Takashi Tachibana, a food business entrepreneur and a co-founder of Oh Guts, moved from Tokyo to Ogatsu last year to to help market the brand and attract investment.</p> <p>The idea, he says, is for the fishermen to produce, sell and process everything themselves, bypassing the costly and inefficient distribution system many blame for stifling small Japanese fisheries.</p> <p>\"You can feel the energy of the people here,\" says Tachibana. \"Some fishermen may not like the idea of being employed by outsiders, but they will have direct contact with the people who buy their products. That makes a huge difference.\"</p> <p>For Ito, restructuring is a small price to pay for the chance to board his boat and inspect beds teeming with oysters and scallops. \"We don't bear a grudge against the sea,\" he says. \"It took away our living and our loved ones, but now it's beginning to give something back.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cineworld, the UK's leading cinema chain, has reported a 9.9% rise in profits after the box office success of films including The King's Speech, The Inbetweeners, and the final instalment of the Harry Potter franchise. But the company also highlighted pressures on consumers as it reported an increase in midweek discounting, falling interest in pricier 3D screenings and less spending on drinks and snacks. Cineworld, which is introducing vibrating seats to some cinemas this month as part of a new \"4D\" experience, said pre-tax profits rose 9.9% to \u00a333.4m in the year to 29 December 2011 as sales edged up 1.5% to \u00a3348m. The average ticket price per admission was up 2p at \u00a35.01, while average retail spending per person fell to \u00a31.69 from \u00a31.73 the previous year. The company said the rise in profits was testimony to \"the continuing appeal of cinema even in difficult economic times\", echoing industry reports suggesting people have been opting for cinema as a relatively cheap night out. Turning to the outlook, it added: \"The current financial year has started satisfactorily with a reasonable level of business carrying over from the Christmas period with the main films being Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. \"The performances of films released so far this year such as The Artist, Iron Lady and War Horse, whilst receiving critical acclaim and being in line with internal expectations, have been lower than the same period last year, which benefitted from the unexpected success of The King's Speech.\" For the year ahead, Cineworld flagged pressures on cinema-going from the upcoming Olympics and the European football championship but said there were blockbuster releases later in 2012 to support business for the rest of the year, including the next Bond film Skyfall, The Hobbit and The Dark Knight Rises. It noted that the \"general economic and consumer environment is expected to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future and will continue to present trading challenges\". Chiming with recent industry reports, Cineworld said \"certain segments of the customer base\" were preferring to see 2D screenings over 3D to save on admission price. It also warned a tough advertising market could affect how much cinemas make from advertisers. Shares in the company closed up 7.25p at 207.25p.",

[I will identify this bird in 48 hours] Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 11 February 2012 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D7000 Question: This small Chinese mystery bird is popping up in the most unlikely places all over the world. Why? Can you identify this bird's taxonomic family and species? Is it male or female? The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don't spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird's identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints so others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints may read like \"inside jokes\" and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others' enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone's enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication. You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page. If you have bird images, video or audio files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at The Guardian, feel free to contact me to learn more. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientist email: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

Don't spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours. <br><strong>2.</strong> If you know the mystery bird's identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints so others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints may read like \"inside jokes\" and thus, may discourage others from participating. <br><strong>3.</strong> Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. <br><strong>4.</strong> Comments that spoil others' enjoyment may be deleted.</p> <p><em>The Game:</em> </p> <p><strong>1.</strong> This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). <br><strong>2.</strong> Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. <br><strong>3.</strong> Thoughtful comments will add to everyone's enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. <br><strong>4.</strong> Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication. </p> <p>You are invited to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/mystery-bird\">review all of the daily mystery birds</a> by going to their dedicated graphic index page. </p> <p>If you have bird images, video or audio files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at <em>The Guardian</em>, feel free to contact me to learn more. </p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>twitter: @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/GrrlScientist\">GrrlScientist</a> <br>facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grrlscientist\">grrlscientist</a> <br>email: <a href=\"mailto:grrlscientist@gmail.com\">grrlscientist@gmail.com</a></p>",

The total saving for the Department of Health (DH) from NPfIT will now be approximately \u00a31.8bn. Health secretary Andrew Lansley told an E-Health Insider event in London today that the money it has secured from US-based firm CSC would be released back to the NHS. An announcement on how the money will be distributed is expected in the coming months. Following years of waste and delay in introducing electronic care records to hospitals, the agreement signals a huge breakthrough, according to Lansley. \"We are in talks with our largest supplier CSC about a new deal, a deal which gives trusts in the north, Midlands and east of England freedom to choose which systems they use. The overriding priority for this is to maximise value for money and to be open about costs and benefits,\" he said. CSC was contracted to deliver Lorenzo electronic patient records to trusts in the north, Midlands and east of England but the project has suffered from severe delays. The DH has been locked in renegotiations with the supplier for more than a year to revise the scope of the deal and claw back some the money it has spent with the company. In May 2011 the department's chief information officer at the time, Christine Connelly, warned that it would be cheaper for the DH to keep its contract, rather than extricating itself from the deal as CSC could seek substantial damages. At the end of last year CSC made it clear in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would be prepared to launch legal action against the government if it tried to terminate the contract, but the company appeared to soften its stance at the end of last year by confirming a $1.5bn write-off of the NPfIT deal.

      "bodyText": "News Group Newspapers, the publisher of the Sun and the now-closed News of the World, has been described by a high court judge of having an \"enthusiastic involvement\" with the police and of failing to protect the sources of a story involving the prison conditions of Soham killer Ian Huntley. Judge Pearce-Higgins said in a pre-trial judgment that the publisher had \"acted at all times in a way to protect their own interests\" and \"took no steps to claim the protection usually afforded to journalists in respect of their sources\" during a leak enquiry handled by Durham police. The pointed comments were made in a pre-trial judgment handed down on 28 February in Birmingham where Rupert Murdoch's newspaper group is being sued for \u00a3100,000 by a secret informant. John Capewell, the brother of a prison officer, claims that the former chief lawyer of the Sun and the News of the World, Tom Crone, told police that he was the source of leaked stories about Soham killer Ian Huntley. Capewell wants the court to rule that this was in breach of an anonymity agreement between the parties. Judge Pearce-Higgins said in the judgment: \"The evidence here suggests that [News Group Newspapers (NGN)] took no steps to protect the claimant [Capewell] notwithstanding the agreement between them. \"[News Group Newspapers] acted at all times in a way to protect its own interests rather than any higher motive to see justice done. It took no steps to claim the protection usually afforded to journalists in respect of their sources.\" The judge said in his ruling that Capewell's claim has a \"real prospect of success\" and can proceed to a full trial against the publisher. No date for the trial has been set, but the judge indicated that he expected News Group Newspapers to \"explain its enthusiastic involvement with the police\". NGN has applied to have the claim struck out, on the grounds that it cannot be sued over information provided to assist the police in an ongoing investigation. The judge said that police had independently discovered that Capewell was the secret informant before officers had spoken to NGN. Capewell is the brother of a former prison warden at HMP Frankland in Durham, where Huntley is serving a life sentence for the murder in 2002 of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. He approached the News of the World in 2008 offering \"anonymous information\" about Huntley's prison conditions in return for a sum of money. The court heard that Capewell signed an anonymity pledge after meeting with the former NoW reporter Chris Tate in April 2008. He signed a further anonymity agreement on 1 May 2008 after another meeting with Tate. NGN is not believed to have paid any money to Capewell and it is not alleged that the News of the World published a story based on this information. However, the court heard that the Sun subsequently published an article, headed \"Be nice to Mr Huntley: Prison guards told to treat Soham child killer like he's part of the family\", on 3 May 2008 that allegedly used quotes provided by Capewell. Capewell claims that NGN breached the anonymity agreement when he was named as the source by Crone in a phone call with officers from Durham Constabulary investigating the leaks. \"This is an area where there are competing rights which have to be balanced and the law is developing,\" said Judge Pearce-Higgins in the pre-trial judgment. \"I am satisfied that [Capewell] has a real prospect of success. In any event bearing in mind the background and current concerns in relation to [NGN] and its relationship with the police (in particular the Metropolitan police), there are in any event other compelling reasons why this claim should proceed to trial.\" Morgan Rees, the lawyer for Capewell, told the court at a pre-trial hearing that a judgment against his client would \"send out the chilling message that press confidentiality agreements are of no value\". The pre-trial judgment came just days after journalists at the Sun lined up a separate human rights challenge to News Corporation's management and standards committee, which handed over information about confidential sources to the police leading to the arrest of several journalists. Another News International title, the Sunday Times, came in for criticism after it disclosed emails between a source and the Sunday Times political editor, Isabel Oakeshott, to officers investigating the former energy secretary Chris Huhne over an alleged speeding offence. The publisher handed over the emails after initially putting up a legal challenge. NGN has not yet submitted a defence in the Capewell action but is expected to contest the claim shortly.

      "bodyText": "This week I was invited to chair a roundtable on the topic of green communications and, specifically, what the experience of McDonald's recent McStories Twitter misadventure might tell us about social media sustainability communications. In January, you may remember, McDonald's found itself embroiled in a social media mess after a marketing campaign to get people tweeting about their best McDonald's experience using the hashtag #McStories backfired spectacularly. Everyone on the roundtable agreed that the stream Twitter invective levelled at the fast food giant through #McStories was an obvious signal that companies can't control marketing messages in the social media age. Some in the discussion also thought it might make companies think twice about getting involved in social media. Yet, all agreed that the potential power of social media was too big an opportunity to ignore for companies looking to communicate sustainability. Indeed, we all agreed that social media and sustainability should be a particularly powerful combination given that both are rooted in the principles of authenticity, transparency, collaboration and community. So what is holding companies back? Well, putting it plainly, companies are petrified of screwing-up, and that fear is magnified when their social responsibility is put under the microscope. It's not hard to understand their reticence. Twenty-three of the case studies in our new book, #FAIL: The 50 Greatest Social Media Screw-Ups, are sustainability or CSR-related. Obvious examples are BP's experience during the Deepwater Horizon disaster, Unilever's Dove brand getting ambushed by Greenpeace, and, yes, the recent #McStories fiasco. Others are less well known but just as enlightening. They include Kenneth Cole, Microsoft's Bing and Habitat's tin-eared marketing approach to Twitter communications, along with Carnival Cruise's recent confused approach to social media crisis communications. Each screw-up is slightly different but trends do emerge. Through analysing all the ways since 2004 that companies have been caught short in a crisis, ambushed by the voice of the people or engaged in plain dumb marketing it is clear that, time and time again: \u2022 Companies underestimate the collaborative and viral power of social media \u2022 Marketing, PR, crisis and sustainability teams fail to communicate with one another before communicating to the public \u2022 Brands think they can use old-school marketing tricks and messages to control conversations. Ironically, one of the most revealing case studies is Carnival Cruises, a company that has been lauded for its smart social media marketing. It has 1.4 million fans on Facebook and keeps them dreaming of that next vacation with sunny, upbeat updates on exotic locations. However, all that changed on the fateful evening of 13 January when the Carnival-operated Costa Concordia ran aground on the rocks of Italian island, Giglio, killing 25 people and leaving seven missing and presumed dead. Initially, Carnival turned its conversational clout to informing the world about the rescue efforts and the company's dedication to safety. Then, on 19 January Carnival posted this on its Facebook wall: \"Out of respect for all those affected by the recent events surrounding our sister line, Costa cruises, we are going to take a bit of a break from posting on our social channels. We will still be actively listening and answering any questions you have about your past or upcoming cruises, but for now, the majority of our time will be spent focusing on all those affected by this event. We thank you again for all your support.\" Except that it didn't take a break. One day later Carnival's Twitter account retweeted a Friday Follow (#FF) shout-out for the company, as well as some other upbeat marketing messages. At the same time, news broke that Carnival had offered to compensate Concordia survivors by offering a 30% discount off their next Carnival cruise \u2026 and social media channels lit up with outrage over the company's insensitivity. Unfortunately for Carnival, between 19 and 24 January, when it was getting roasted, the company was silent on Facebook and bumbling on Twitter with a few inane posts that neither suggested respect for victims of the tragedy nor any indication that it was listening to the social media storm brewing around its insensitive discount offer. So where did Carnival go wrong? The key to successful social media crisis communication is all about having structures and processes in place to deal with information and innuendo that is spreading virally in real time. At first, Carnival gained social media kudos for responding promptly, and with useful information, to customer concerns and queries. But the longer the crisis continued it seemed the company was caught between its default social media marketing mentality and an emergency response directive. The result was Carnival sent out a series of mixed messages. Also, by \"going dark\" during a crucial point in handling the crisis, it lost the ability to use social media to answer growing criticisms of how it was treating the victims. Corporate experience of social media is only eight years old but, as the many instances of screw-ups and mistakes make clear, communicating successfully in this new online landscape requires a sea change in the way companies operate. That is especially true when it comes to sustainability communications. Yet, as those thinkers at the recent roundtable quickly identified, if companies adhere to the jointly held values of authenticity, transparency, collaboration and community, social media should hold no fear.

Twenty-three of the case studies in our new book, <a href=\"http://socialmediainfluence.com/fail-the-50-greatest-social-media-screw-ups/\" title=\"\">#FAIL: The 50 Greatest Social Media Screw-Ups</a>, are sustainability or CSR-related.</p> <p>Obvious examples are BP's experience during the Deepwater Horizon disaster, Unilever's Dove brand getting ambushed by Greenpeace, and, yes, the recent #McStories fiasco.</p> <p>Others are less well known but just as enlightening. They include Kenneth Cole, Microsoft's Bing and Habitat's tin-eared marketing approach to Twitter communications, along with Carnival Cruise's recent confused approach to social media crisis communications.</p> <p>Each screw-up is slightly different but trends do emerge. Through analysing all the ways since 2004 that companies have been caught short in a crisis, ambushed by the voice of the people or engaged in plain dumb marketing it is clear that, time and time again:</p> <p>\u2022 Companies underestimate the collaborative and viral power of social media</p> <p>\u2022 Marketing, PR, crisis and sustainability teams fail to communicate with one another before communicating to the public</p> <p>\u2022 Brands think they can use old-school marketing tricks and messages to control conversations.</p> <p>Ironically, one of the most revealing case studies is Carnival Cruises, a company that has been lauded for its smart social media marketing. It has 1.4 million fans on Facebook and keeps them dreaming of that next vacation with sunny, upbeat updates on exotic locations. However, all that changed on the fateful evening of 13 January when the Carnival-operated Costa Concordia ran aground on the rocks of Italian island, Giglio, killing 25 people and leaving seven missing and presumed dead.</p> <p>Initially, Carnival turned its conversational clout to informing the world about the rescue efforts and the company's dedication to safety. Then, on 19 January Carnival posted this on its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Carnival?sk=wall\" title=\"\">Facebook wall</a>:</p> <p>\"Out of respect for all those affected by the recent events surrounding our sister line, Costa cruises, we are going to take a bit of a break from posting on our social channels. We will still be actively listening and answering any questions you have about your past or upcoming cruises, but for now, the majority of our time will be spent focusing on all those affected by this event. We thank you again for all your support.\"</p> <p>Except that it didn't take a break. One day later Carnival's Twitter account retweeted a Friday Follow (#FF) shout-out for the company, as well as some other upbeat marketing messages. At the same time, news broke that Carnival had offered to compensate Concordia survivors by offering a <a href=\"http://uk.news.yahoo.com/costa-concordia-survivors-offered-30--discount-off-next-cruise.html\" title=\"\">30% discount off their next Carnival cruise</a> \u2026 and social media channels lit up with outrage over the company's insensitivity.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Carnival, between 19 and 24 January, when it was getting roasted, the company was silent on Facebook and bumbling on Twitter with a few inane posts that neither suggested respect for victims of the tragedy nor any indication that it was listening to the social media storm brewing around its insensitive discount offer.</p> <p>So where did Carnival go wrong? The key to successful social media crisis communication is all about having structures and processes in place to deal with information and innuendo that is spreading virally in real time.</p> <p>At first, Carnival gained social media kudos for responding promptly, and with useful information, to customer concerns and queries. But the longer the crisis continued it seemed the company was caught between its default social media marketing mentality and an emergency response directive. The result was Carnival sent out a series of mixed messages. Also, by \"going dark\" during a crucial point in handling the crisis, it lost the ability to use social media to answer growing criticisms of how it was treating the victims.</p> <p>Corporate experience of social media is only eight years old but, as the many instances of screw-ups and mistakes make clear, communicating successfully in this new online landscape requires a sea change in the way companies operate. That is especially true when it comes to sustainability communications. Yet, as those thinkers at the recent roundtable quickly identified, if companies adhere to the jointly held values of authenticity, transparency, collaboration and community, social media should hold no fear.</p> <p><em>Matthew Yeomans is the co-author of </em><a href=\"http://socialmediainfluence.com/fail-the-50-greatest-social-media-screw-ups/\" title=\"\"><em>#FAIL: The 50 Greatest Social Media Screw-Ups</em></a><em> and co-founder of </em><a href=\"http://socialmediainfluence.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SMI</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

      "bodyText": "Gaydar Radio owner QSoft Consulting is seeking \"significant cash investment\" and a possible sale of the company that could see it valued at \u00a310m. The company, which also owns Gaydar.co.uk, is majority owned by Henry Badenhorst, who co-founded it with fellow South African Gary Frisch, who died in 2007. Gaydar, home to the UK's most popular gay dating site, said it had received a \"number of recent investment enquiries\" and has appointed Ashcombe Advisers to assist in any deal. QSoft Consulting made pre-tax profits of \u00a3929,900 in 2009, up from \u00a3736,493 the previous year, on the back of revenues of \u00a37,260,642 (down from \u00a37,650,332 in 2008). The new cash investment could see the sale of part or the whole of the company. QSoft is understood to have had \"several offers\" and one in particular \u2013 said to have been a bid for the entire outfit \u2013 was being \"seriously considered\". Key to any sale is that the Gaydar brand is protected. Any offer which comes in for one part of the company, such as the website, must also be able to demonstrate a suitable business plan for the remaining parts of the business. The company is said to be keen to expand its global presence, with a particular focus on Australia and South America. Ashcombe Advisers senior partner Simon Bullivant said: \"Having created the world's pre-eminent gay brand, the company recognises that further investment and management expertise is required to fulfil the true commercial potential and demand that is being experienced throughout the international and emerging markets.\" Badenhorst and Frisch moved to London from South Africa in 1997 to set up IT firm QSoft. Having previously specialised in revenue management systems for airlines, they set up the Gaydar dating site after a Dutch friend asked them to help him find a boyfriend. \"Gaydar started as something we did on the side,\" said Badenhorst in an interview in 2009. \"We didn't realise what we were creating.\" Frisch died in 2007 aged 38 after falling from a balcony. He left Badenhorst an estate worth more than \u00a36.5m. Gaydar Radio does not subscribe to official industry audience body Rajar but claims more than 750,000 listeners a month. Gaydar.co.uk has 6 million registered users in more than 140 countries. It is available in the UK online, on digital audio broadcasting (DAB) radio in London and the south-east and via the Gaydar Radio app. It was taken off the Sky Digital platform last year. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

It's what the Six Nations is all about and if Wales are in pole position at the moment, you can bet your life that Italy on Saturday and then France the following Saturday won't make life easy. That said, there is a feel about the Wales squad at the moment which was enhanced by a rare sighting this week of the 2009 Lions front row back together again, giving the scrum machine a rare old going-over in anticipation of what the Italians will be bringing to the Millennium Stadium. Rare? Absolutely. Since South Africa Gethin Jenkins, Matthew Rees and Adam Jones have played as a unit just the once, but their coming together this week helped underscore the feeling that Wales are now selecting from real depth. If you need evidence of that, just look at the bench and those who didn't make the starting XV \u2013 Scott Williams, match winner against England, Luke Charteris, close to being one of the best locks at the World Cup, James Hook, Ryan Jones, Ken Owens, who went so well at Twickenham, Paul James and Lloyd Williams. Guys such as Lee Byrne, Andy Powell and Gavin Henson, three British and Irish Lions, aren't even on the bench because of the talent coming through which, this week, includes the extraordinarily skilful Justin Tipuric, who slots in as openside flanker for our injured captain, Sam Warburton. Saturday will be Tipuric's fourth cap but his first start and if he's got some big boots to fill, then he is up to the job, no doubt. At the age of 22 he's already captaining the Ospreys and those of you from the other side of Offa's Dyke, who may not have seen him play, are in for a treat. The changing new faces \u2013 and not just for Wales \u2013 has been one of the more interesting traits of this season's tournament. For France, Wesley Fofana, the 24-year-old Clermont Auvergne centre, now has three caps and three tries to his name. From Test debutant against Italy he's gone up a level and you can now see him becoming one of the big stars of the game. Another new boy, Yoann Maestri, might not be far behind. He's big and frankly looked off the pace when he came on as a replacement from the bench against Italy. Initially he hit rucks too late and seemed more of a nuisance than a help but as the game progressed the giant second row started to make his presence felt. His first start at Murrayfield was also clearly another part of the learning process \u2013 but against Ireland I felt we were starting to see the development of a new Simon Shaw. Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 likes his packs to be big and experienced but the arrival of Maestri signals the start of what has to happen as France make their way to the next World Cup. What the promotion of the scrum-half Julien Dupuy and fly-half Lionel Beauxis at the expense of Morgan Parra and Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc signals is altogether different: more an acceptance of England's defensive prowess \u2013 which in my book is quite a compliment \u2013 than a nod to the future. The more I see of England's defence, the more I realise it comes from the Brendan Venter playbook developed while he was at London Irish and given the final polish at Saracens and Saint-Andr\u00e9 has accepted that he needs Beauxis's big boot if France are to play in England territory. A fully fit Dimitri Yachvili might have changed the scrum-half equation, especially with his special ability to get the most from his forwards but the French kicking game in Paris last Sunday was below par. I know the All Blacks kick bombs to get out of their own territory, but not against Ireland. No one does, because most of their players were brought up on Gaelic football and in Rob Kearney they probably have one of the best under the high ball. The other new face to impress in the last round was England's No8 Ben Morgan, very much a fine physical and athletic specimen developed by Scarlets but on his way back over the Severn to Gloucester. England are getting a bit of flak at the moment but I can see them scoring a few tries in Paris on Sunday because of the momentum which Morgan and Manu Tuilagi give them. Both are fine ball carriers and both gave us problems at Twickenham, where Tuilagi broke more tackles than the rest of the England team put together. And that's quite a stat.",

At the age of 22 he's already captaining the Ospreys and those of you from the other side of Offa's Dyke, who may not have seen him play, are in for a treat. The changing new faces \u2013 and not just for Wales \u2013 has been one of the more interesting traits of this season's tournament.</p> <p>For France, Wesley Fofana, the 24-year-old Clermont Auvergne centre, now has three caps and three tries to his name. From Test debutant against Italy he's gone up a level and you can now see him becoming one of the big stars of the game. Another new boy, Yoann Maestri, might not be far behind.</p> <p>He's big and frankly looked off the pace when he came on as a replacement from the bench against Italy. Initially he hit rucks too late and seemed more of a nuisance than a help but as the game progressed the giant second row started to make his presence felt. His first start at Murrayfield was also clearly another part of the learning process \u2013 but against Ireland I felt we were starting to see the development of a new Simon Shaw.</p> <p>Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 likes his packs to be big and experienced but the arrival of Maestri signals the start of what has to happen as France make their way to the next World Cup. What the promotion of the scrum-half Julien Dupuy and fly-half Lionel Beauxis at the expense of Morgan Parra and Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc signals is altogether different: more an acceptance of England's defensive prowess \u2013 which in my book is quite a compliment \u2013 than a nod to the future.</p> <p>The more I see of England's defence, the more I realise it comes from the Brendan Venter playbook developed while he was at London Irish and given the final polish at Saracens and Saint-Andr\u00e9 has accepted that he needs Beauxis's big boot if France are to play in England territory.</p> <p>A fully fit Dimitri Yachvili might have changed the scrum-half equation, especially with his special ability to get the most from his forwards but the French kicking game in Paris last Sunday was below par. I know the All Blacks kick bombs to get out of their own territory, but not against Ireland. No one does, because most of their players were brought up on Gaelic football and in Rob Kearney they probably have one of the best under the high ball.</p> <p>The other new face to impress in the last round was England's No8 Ben Morgan, very much a fine physical and athletic specimen developed by Scarlets but on his way back over the Severn to Gloucester.</p> <p>England are getting a bit of flak at the moment but I can see them scoring a few tries in Paris on Sunday because of the momentum which Morgan and Manu Tuilagi give them.</p> <p>Both are fine ball carriers and both gave us problems at Twickenham, where Tuilagi broke more tackles than the rest of the England team put together. And that's quite a stat.</p>",

Originally known as International Working Women's Day, its roots lie in the socialist, rather than feminist, struggle of the early 20th century. Although national days had been celebrated prior to 1911, the 18 March of that year marked the first International day, following a proposal from German communist Clara Zetkin. Zetkin had been involved with the socialist movement in Germany since the 1870's, and her name frequently came up in Manchester Guardian reports on the annual International Socialist and Trade Unions Congress. She was also a fervent campaigner for women's rights and universal suffrage, although, as this profile by Shelley Holland, published in the Guardian in 1992, illustrates, Zetkin believed socialism was the only movement that 'could truly serve the needs of working-class women' - and that feminism was the preserve of the upper and middle-classes. However, as much as her political views were focussed on class, rather than gender, divisions, reports such as the one below in the Manchester Guardian from 1901 perhaps only served to highlight how women were viewed at the time. Despite the mention of a 'Niagara of shrill invective,' Zetkin was renowned throughout her career for her passionate oratory skills. She represented the German Communist Party in the Reichstag from 1920 until 1933 (when the party was banned by Hitler). Her election to the Reichstag in 1932 made her its oldest member, and tradition dictated she opened the parliamentary session. She did so with a 40 minute attack on Hitler and the Nazi party. Clara Zetkin died in 1933. In her obituary (see below), the Manchester Guardian referred to her as the 'grandmother of communism,' yet the legacy of International Women's Day, and her contribution to it, should also be recognised, and celebrated.

Thousands of nurses and other health professionals went on strike last week in a dispute over allowances and benefits, halting operations in many hospitals around the country. As reports mounted of patients being neglected, the two main unions met the government on Sunday and agreed to return to work, but many strikers rejected the deal. The Daily Nation newspaper reported on Thursday that a mother and her newborn son had bled to death on Tuesday outside a dispensary in Kwale County on the Indian Ocean coast after health workers refused to treat them. \"What is the use? Why should we have hospitals and personnel? Why was my wife left to die just like that?\" Chaka Kadide, the husband of the dead woman, 35-year-old Chari Katana, told the paper. Frederick Omiah, a member of the Kenya Health Professionals Society, said the government's decision had set up a \"very ugly scenario\" and he feared strikers would continue protests in Nairobi and elsewhere. \"This is going to make an already delicate and volatile situation worse. Most surveys indicate the workers are not back at work \u2026 when somebody is wounded if you add another injury, they will get more infuriated,\" he said. Mutua said there would be no problem replacing the sacked workers. A consultative team set up by the government to look into their grievances will continue its work. \"We have over 100,000 to 200,000 health professionals looking for work today \u2026 There will be a lag of a day or two \u2026 but it is better than letting people die on the floor, at the gate, or suffer in pain,\" Mutua said.",

      "bodyText": "Bravo Ivan Jovanovic, the superhero of Champions League coaches Anyone who witnessed the unbridled elation in Nicosia, with players climbing on goalposts and massed bundles of impassioned people jumping all over each other as if free love was back in fashion, could recognise that something exceptionally special happened for Apoel. Right from the very start of their Champions League adventure, which began in the pre-qualifiers back in July in Albania, three hurdles before the big guns join the competition, Apoel have enjoyed success after success. As the stakes have got higher, their sense of giddiness has increased. Planting their flag in the quarter-finals is a monumental achievement. The mastermind, their Serbian coach Ivan Jovanovic, looked almost lost for words as he surveyed the celebratory scenes. The team he has fashioned, who play with admirable organisation and determination, rose to the occasion brilliantly against a Lyon side that had superior individual talent but inferior appetite. \"Nothing makes you happier than seeing so many people rejoice from your achievement,\" said Jovanovic. \"We never believed that we would be where we are today. But when you have players with so much confidence, then it is possible. When you have a stadium filled with fans like ours, then it is possible.\" Lyon's nerves got to them, particularly in the penalty shootout, which belonged more than anyone to Dionisios Chiotis, Apoel's zealous goalkeeper. He is not the biggest keeper in the world. According to the Uefa statistics he is a shade over 5ft 9in. But he was a monster in his mind. It was charismatic, heart-on-the-sleeve stuff as he gave his opponent the eyeball before each penalty while dancing around on his toes as if he had insects in his boots, then reacted ferociously to each kick. He howled with frustration at the ones that got away (one struck a post and then bounced in off his own back) and hared off like a man possessed when he kept out Alexandre Lacazette and Michel Bastos. \"Things are getting serious now,\" said Chiotis afterwards. \"We need to wait to see who else gets into the quarter-finals, but there isn't one team we would prefer to play \u2013 just let's not get Barcelona.\" A footnote. Gustavo Manduca is suspended for the next game as he was sent off for two bookable offences. The first was for whipping his shirt off to twirl around his head after scoring Apoel's historic goal. By the standards of his career (a nomadic player, his highlights up to now are a couple of cups in Finland and a runner-up medal in the Greek cup) it was not unreasonable for him to lose himself for a moment. Please can we obliterate this silly rule? Worrying times for French football Olympique Lyonnais have wounds to lick. The Champions League regulars, who are used to reaching the quarter-finals of the competition, are understandably shellshocked to have tumbled out to Apoel. But there is a bigger picture problem as well. Lyon's humiliating exit has come at a disturbing time for football in France. A political debate threatens to destabilise the game to such an extent the league's president, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Thiriez, is warning of \"the death of French football\". Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the frontrunner to win the general election in May, recently announced his intention to raise tax for the super rich to 75%. The effects on football are obvious. Thiriez estimates up to 150 players fall into the category of earners whose salary tops \u20ac1m, and an exodus will be difficult to stop if Hollande's proposed tax rates \u2013 an increase of almost 30% \u2013 are approved. Thierez reckoned the implications would effectively relegate France, \"to play in the second division of Europe, along with Slovenia or countries like that\". The nouveau riche Paris Saint-Germain, current leaders of Ligue 1 and keen to dine again at the Champions League table next season, could have some very difficult planning ahead. Mind the gap It's blindingly obvious that Lionel Messi gives Barcelona an unfair advantage over any opponent simply by being wonderful enough to be, without any logical dispute, comfortably the finest player of his generation. We can all argue as much as we like about whether he is the best of any generation. Better to just sit back and enjoy the show, though. How can you not love a player who had done more than enough in the first leg with a goal and a gorgeous assist to have dropped down a gear in the second leg, but instead hit supercharged ones? It will probably never happen, as Messi will presumably spend his whole career at Barcelona, but it would be fascinating to see him at another club just to see if he can make as much of a difference to a team that may not be as perfectly designed to synchronise with his gifts. There is his experience with Argentina to give a different perspective, but even the critics who are not convinced by his international displays now have a recent hat-trick for his country to put in their pipe and smoke. What a strange evening for Christian Tello, the 20-year-old substitute who scored twice on his Champions League debut. His current record of two goals in 37 minutes in European competition would have been some story were it not for Messi's quintet, but his cameo got lost somewhere in the bigger story. Without wanting to be churlish when Barcelona are so enjoyable to watch, it is concerning for European football to see the chasm between a top team in Spain and Germany in the knockout stages. That 7-1 scoreline \u2013 or indeed the 10-2 aggregate \u2013 is almost unhealthy. Galliani really didn't need to panic Perfectly reasonably, Arsenal were able to reflect that the tie was lost in San Siro. But considering the situation they found themselves in at half-time back in London, on a roll and needing one more goal to restore parity with Milan, there is an argument that the tie was actually lost in January. It is not the best time in the world to buy players, and this winter window was slower than ever, but when Arsenal had no option but to chuck on Marouane Chamakh and Park Chu-young against Milan, it was reasonable to wonder again why Ars\u00e8ne Wenger didn't buy a striker in January. On the evidence of the season so far, the manager clearly doesn't trust either player to take any of the goalscoring burden from Robin van Persie. But Arsenal's unwillingness to address a glaring problem when they had a chance cost them. Who knows what the climax would have felt like had they been able to make a change or two that was more purposeful than two forwards who are so shorn of confidence they look as if the ball is going to hurt them. Balancing a squad is a tricky business, but it did not go unnoticed by some of those leaving the Emirates Stadium that Arsenal actually own two attacking players who might have had more impact than the pair who came on. Nicklas Bendtner and Andrey Arshavin may not be Wenger's cup of tea, but might they have offered more threat than Chamakh and Park? Milan's vice-president Adriano Galliani, who apparently couldn't bear to watch, really needn't have worried enough to bolt down to the dressing rooms for the closing stages. \"I suffered and I opted against watching the last 20 minutes. After that Robin van Persie chance I thought I was going to die, instead I'm fortunately alive,\" he wheezed. The final result made Arsenal feel better about themselves, but it is important they don't use a very respectable result to paper over the cracks. Until they can add some more substance to back up the first XI, there is only so far they can go. Arguably, if Milan learned one thing from their uncomfortable evening it is that they too suffer when so many of their main players are unavailable. Their first-choice team is enticing, but Massimiliano Allegri was not impressed with some of the back-up players, who strained to make a positive impression. They could do with the likes of Kevin-Prince Boateng and Alessandro Nesta back for the quarter-finals. All is not lost for Chelsea, Bayern, and Inter The seeding system, in which the group winners get home advantage for the second leg of the last 16 ties, was influential in three of the four games this week. Barcelona's situation was more or less academic. But for Apoel, Benfica, and to an extent Arsenal, home comforts made a difference. Benfica deserve credit for controlling their situation decisively. They trailed 3-2 to Zenit St Petersburg, and a hard fought, solid 2-0 victory saw them through with a goal in stoppage time of each half. It all went according to Jorge Jesus's plans. \"It was important to score first as we knew they could cause us problems if we didn't. Once we went ahead we were able to hit them on the counterattack,\" noted Benfica's coach. There is another reason they are a good example for the likes of Chelsea, Bayern and Inter, who all go into their second legs playing catch up. Benfica had been in poor form and under pressure domestically, which is very much the case for all the top seeds next week apart from Real Madrid. The Portuguese club managed to put their worries to one side to reignite their form in Europe. On another note, Benfica, as you might expect, had a very Latin feel to their team. But interestingly, not one of their starting XI was Portuguese. Jesus fielded five Brazilians, two Spaniards, and one each from Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Belgium.",

      "body": "<h2>Bravo Ivan Jovanovic, the superhero of Champions League coaches</h2> <p>Anyone who witnessed the unbridled elation in Nicosia, with players climbing on goalposts and massed bundles of impassioned people jumping all over each other as if free love was back in fashion, could recognise that something exceptionally special happened for Apoel. Right from the very start of their Champions League adventure, which began in the pre-qualifiers back in July in Albania, three hurdles before the big guns join the competition, Apoel have enjoyed success after success. As the stakes have got higher, their sense of giddiness has increased. Planting their flag in the quarter-finals is a monumental achievement.</p> <p>The mastermind, their Serbian coach Ivan Jovanovic, looked almost lost for words as he surveyed the celebratory scenes. The team he has fashioned, who play with admirable organisation and determination, rose to the occasion brilliantly against a Lyon side that had superior individual talent but inferior appetite. \"Nothing makes you happier than seeing so many people rejoice from your achievement,\" said Jovanovic. \"We never believed that we would be where we are today. But when you have players with so much confidence, then it is possible. When you have a stadium filled with fans like ours, then it is possible.\"</p> <p>Lyon's nerves got to them, particularly in the penalty shootout, which belonged more than anyone to Dionisios Chiotis, Apoel's zealous goalkeeper. He is not the biggest keeper in the world. According to the Uefa statistics he is a shade over 5ft 9in. But he was a monster in his mind. It was charismatic, heart-on-the-sleeve stuff as he gave his opponent the eyeball before each penalty while dancing around on his toes as if he had insects in his boots, then reacted ferociously to each kick. He howled with frustration at the ones that got away (one struck a post and then bounced in off his own back) and hared off like a man possessed when he kept out Alexandre Lacazette and Michel Bastos.</p> <p>\"Things are getting serious now,\" said Chiotis afterwards. \"We need to wait to see who else gets into the quarter-finals, but there isn't one team we would prefer to play \u2013 just let's not get Barcelona.\"</p> <p>A footnote. Gustavo Manduca is suspended for the next game as he was sent off for two bookable offences. The first was for whipping his shirt off to twirl around his head after scoring Apoel's historic goal.

      "bodyText": "Sly Bailey, Trinity Mirror's grossly overpaid chief executive, is standing firm against calls by shareholders to cut her annual salary. However, I understand that next week she will announce that she is waiving her bonus. Then again, investors may well think this is too little too late. Her inadequate business strategy has been laid bare by what has happened to her Sunday titles following Rupert Murdoch's launch of the Sun on Sunday. The gains made by the Sunday Mirror and The People after the closure of the News of the World last July have evaporated within two weeks. As I reported in my London Evening Standard column yesterday, the unofficial circulation estimates suggest both TM titles have lost almost all their new buyers. Why should that be? Well, there isn't a single reason, of course. The strength of The Sun brand should never be underestimated, nor should its professional journalistic production values. But the Sunday Mirror (I haven't studied The People as closely) has had a couple of good weeks in terms of editorial content. On a page-by-page basis - allowing for the fact that The Sun has many more pages - the Sunday Mirror has offered stiff opposition. Indeed, on the first week, it did a great deal better than The Sun, as several of The Sun's staff conceded to me privately. It made no difference, however. To get a real understanding of the reasons for the failure to capitalise on the opportunity afforded by the NoW's disappearance, we have to consider the failures of TM's management, meaning Bailey. She had eight months when her titles had no News International competition. During that period it was crucial to lock in the new buyers in order to secure their loyalty. After all, it was no secret that Murdoch would eventually launch a Sunday issue of The Sun. To woo the bereft News of the World audience it was necessary to invest in the papers, to spend on marketing and promotion. That has never been Bailey's way. She is a one-trick pony - cut, cut and cut again. Her business strategy ever since she arrived at Trinity Mirror has been one of cost-cutting. It made short-term sense to please the City. It has been hopeless in the long term. I've been watching the slow motion car crash for eight years now. Yes, Murdoch is a gambler. His company has vast resources compared to those of Trinity Mirror. But why didn't it diversify year ago when it could see the perils of operating in a mature market? Why has it allowed its flagship titles to wither on the vine? I'm not against cuts. I know they are necessary. But there has to be a moment when that is counter-productive, and I believe that point has been reached now. When the latest round of cuts were announced I referred to them as 2012 newspaper reality. Then a couple of Mirror group staff took me through them step by step to show the effects on editorial output. That presented me with an altogether more worrying picture. I realised that Bailey was requiring her journalists to produce papers on a shoe string. I can accept the new production methods - centralised remote subbing by PA and individual remote subbing by staff working from home - plus the use of freelance photographers. But the creative news-gathering, feature-writing hub was also being destroyed along with the number of executives, who should be a paper's driving force because they commission. They are the people who have the ideas. It is all very well to say that Richard Desmond's titles have even fewer staff and are still able to produce papers. So what?

      "body": "<p>Sly Bailey, Trinity Mirror's grossly overpaid chief executive, is standing firm against calls by shareholders to cut her annual salary.</p> <p>However, I understand that next week she will announce that she is waiving her bonus. Then again, investors may well think this is too little too late.</p> <p>Her inadequate business strategy has been laid bare by what has happened to her Sunday titles following Rupert Murdoch's launch of the Sun on Sunday.</p> <p>The gains made by the Sunday Mirror and The People after the closure of the News of the World last July have evaporated within two weeks. </p> <p>As I reported in <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/business/media/media-analysis-sly-bailey-must-look-in-the-mirror-over-sunday-failure-7543833.html\">my London Evening Standard column yesterday</a>, the unofficial circulation estimates suggest both TM titles have lost almost all their new buyers. </p> <p>Why should that be? Well, there isn't a single reason, of course. The strength of The Sun brand should never be underestimated, nor should its professional journalistic production values.</p> <p>But the Sunday Mirror (I haven't studied The People as closely) has had a couple of good weeks in terms of editorial content. On a page-by-page basis - allowing for the fact that The Sun has many more pages - the Sunday Mirror has offered stiff opposition.</p> <p>Indeed, on the first week, it did a great deal better than The Sun, as several of The Sun's staff conceded to me privately. It made no difference, however.</p> <p>To get a real understanding of the reasons for the failure to capitalise on the opportunity afforded by the NoW's disappearance, we have to consider the failures of TM's management, meaning Bailey. She had eight months when her titles had no News International competition.</p> <p>During that period it was crucial to lock in the new buyers in order to secure their loyalty. After all, it was no secret that Murdoch would eventually launch a Sunday issue of The Sun. </p> <p>To woo the bereft News of the World audience it was necessary to invest in the papers, to spend on marketing and promotion. That has never been Bailey's way.</p> <p>She is a one-trick pony - cut, cut and cut again. Her business strategy ever since she arrived at Trinity Mirror has been one of cost-cutting. </p> <p>It made short-term sense to please the City. It has been hopeless in the long term. I've been watching the slow motion car crash for eight years now. </p> <p>Yes, Murdoch is a gambler. His company has vast resources compared to those of Trinity Mirror. But why didn't it diversify year ago when it could see the perils of operating in a mature market? </p> <p>Why has it allowed its flagship titles to wither on the vine? I'm not against cuts. I know they are necessary. But there has to be a moment when that is counter-productive, and I believe that point has been reached now.</p> <p>When the latest round of cuts were announced I referred to them as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/feb/01/trinity-mirror-downturn\">2012 newspaper reality</a>. Then a couple of Mirror group staff took me through them step by step to show the effects on editorial output.</p> <p>That presented me with an altogether more worrying picture. I realised that Bailey was requiring her journalists to produce papers on a shoe string. I can accept the new production methods - centralised remote subbing by PA and individual remote subbing by staff working from home - plus the use of freelance photographers.</p> <p>But the creative news-gathering, feature-writing hub was also being destroyed along with the number of executives, who should be a paper's driving force because they commission. They are the people who have the ideas.</p> <p>It is all very well to say that Richard Desmond's titles have even fewer staff and are still able to produce papers. So what? I can recall times when six of us produced Suns over the course of three days in the 80s, and there have been similar examples in strike-hit papers in the past.</p> <p>A paper will always come out, but that doesn't mean it will be any good.

      "bodyText": "BBC local radio services facing controversial cuts have found an unlikely saviour \u2013 BSkyB. The satellite broadcaster is reducing what it charges the BBC to transmit its TV channels and radio stations by more than \u00a35m a year, with the corporation planning to use the windfall to reduce the local radio cuts. BSkyB charges TV and radio broadcasters annual fees to carry their channels and stations on its satellite service with ITV, Channel 4, the BBC and Channel 5 currently paying about \u00a324m a year. Sky has said that it will slash those costs by over 50% by 2014 \u2013 from \u00a324.4m to \u00a311m for the main broadcasters \u2013 a combined saving of more than \u00a316m. The biggest beneficiary will be the BBC, which has almost 50 radio and TV channels on Sky, which will save \u00a35.5m a year from 2014. John Tate, the director of policy and strategy at the BBC, said that most of the cash savings would go toward reducing about \u00a310m a year in cuts that the corporation is looking to make in its local radio operations. The BBC pays \u00a39.9m a year, this will drop to just \u00a34.4m in staged cuts by 2014. ITV currently pays \u00a38.1m but by 2014 will pay \u00a33.1m, a \u00a35m a year annual saving. Channel 4 will see its annual fees fall from \u00a35m to \u00a32.7m, while Channel 5's will drop from \u00a31.4m to \u00a3800,000. BSkyB is reducing the charges to all of the hundreds of broadcasters that pay to have channels on its platform. The public service broadcasters have been lobbying for BSkyB to pay a considerable amount to carry their channels as they are the most popular on the Sky platform. They argue that research estimates based on international comparisons indicate that BSkyB should pay as much as \u00a3120m a year. \"The value Sky gets out of carrying BBC channels is huge, if Sky had to pay for that it would be hundreds of millions of pounds,\" said Tate. \"Licence fee payers are being unfairly disadvantaged, the logic is that Sky should be paying to carry the most popular channels.\" BSkyB argues that the charges, which are regulated by Ofcom, have reduced over time as the broadcaster has recouped set up costs of \u00a31bn. \"We have published a new rate card which sees a reduction in platform contribution charges for more than a hundred channels on the Sky platform, including all public service broadcasters,\" said a spokesman for Sky. \" Our charges \u2026 have reduced as the costs of developing the platform have increasingly been recouped.\" A Sky spokesman refuted the argument that it should pay PSBs for their channels. In the US, News Corporation, Sky's biggest shareholder with a 39% stake, has successfully persuaded pay-TV operators to fork out transmission fees for its Fox free-to-air network. Historically, the four network broadcasters in the US received no money from cable and satellite operators for their channels, but the situation has changed in recent years. Mark Thompson, the BBC director general, used the News Corp transmission fees to argue that Sky should also be paying to broadcast terrestrial channels in the UK, in his MacTaggart lecture at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival in 2010. However, Sky argued that it was wrong to draw a comparison between US transmission fees and the UK TV market. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "John Terry has admitted Chelsea's players are culpable for the team's toils this season and need to \"hold their hands up\" over Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's sacking as the club's manager only eight months into a three-year contract. The captain is in contention to feature in Saturday's visit of Stoke City having returned a month ahead of schedule from exploratory surgery on his knee, and was an unused substitute as the interim first-team coach, Roberto Di Matteo, oversaw Tuesday's FA Cup fifth-round replay victory at Birmingham City. While some senior players had become disgruntled under Villas-Boas, Terry was broadly supportive of the manager, who had consistently backed the defender after he was charged with a racially aggravated public order offence following an altercation with Anton Ferdinand at QPR in October. A sequence of three wins in 12 Premier League matches, culminating in last Saturday's 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion, has seen Chelsea drop out of the top four and prompted Roman Abramovich, much to his own frustration, to sack Villas-Boas in person during a visit to the training ground on Sunday. \"It's sad for Andr\u00e9 because, unfortunately, it falls on his head when I think the players will hold their hands up and say clearly: 'We've not been good enough and we have all made mistakes together,'\" Terry said. \"We came to Birmingham and dug deep for him, and for Robbie [Di Matteo] taking charge and for Eddie [Newton] coming in as well [on to the coaching staff]. It's nice to have familiar faces around who know the club. We have done enough talking among ourselves for the last three or four months, and Robbie came in and said those exact same things as well, we have to show commitment for the shirt. He has played here, the same as Eddie, and we have to fight for the shirt and that has been the message to the lads for this game.\" Di Matteo is expected to take charge of the first team until the end of the season, when a long-term successor for Villas-Boas will be appointed. Chelsea's hierarchy is deliberating over potential candidates. Rafael Ben\u00edtez is unlikely to be considered, particularly given the negative reaction by the club's supporters at St Andrew's to the Spaniard's interest in the position, though Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola \u2013 potentially optimistic targets \u2013 will be sounded out. The need to qualify for the Champions League next season remains paramount and has been prioritised within the club, not least by Di Matteo in terms of team selection. Terry will hope to prove his fitness against Stoke before next week's second leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Napoli, which Chelsea trail 3-1 from the first game at the Stadio San Paolo. The captain has not played since the fourth-round FA Cup victory at QPR in late January. \"Once I had the operation, I was literally jogging about after two days, which was incredible,\" he added. \"I said to the physios, the way things were here, I just wanted to push myself and be involved and try to get back as quickly as possible. \"I've done that, worked really hard in the gym, been on triple sessions going back late in the evening on my own as well \u2013 which has been tough. The target for myself was always to get back and hopefully be back for the Stoke game, so this is a massive boost for me.\"",

      "body": "<p>John Terry has admitted Chelsea's players are culpable for the team's toils this season and need to \"hold their hands up\" over Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's sacking as the club's manager only eight months into a three-year contract.</p> <p>The captain is in contention to feature in Saturday's visit of Stoke City having returned a month ahead of schedule from exploratory surgery on his knee, and was an unused substitute as the interim first-team coach, Roberto Di Matteo, oversaw Tuesday's FA Cup fifth-round replay victory at Birmingham City.</p> <p>While some senior players had become disgruntled under Villas-Boas, Terry was broadly supportive of the manager, who had consistently backed the defender after he was charged with a racially aggravated public order offence following an altercation with Anton Ferdinand at QPR in October.</p> <p>A sequence of three wins in 12 Premier League matches, culminating in last Saturday's 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion, has seen Chelsea drop out of the top four and prompted Roman Abramovich, much to his own frustration, to sack Villas-Boas in person during a visit to the training ground on Sunday. \"It's sad for Andr\u00e9 because, unfortunately, it falls on his head when I think the players will hold their hands up and say clearly: 'We've not been good enough and we have all made mistakes together,'\" Terry said.</p> <p>\"We came to Birmingham and dug deep for him, and for Robbie [Di Matteo] taking charge and for Eddie [Newton] coming in as well [on to the coaching staff]. It's nice to have familiar faces around who know the club. We have done enough talking among ourselves for the last three or four months, and Robbie came in and said those exact same things as well, we have to show commitment for the shirt. He has played here, the same as Eddie, and we have to fight for the shirt and that has been the message to the lads for this game.\"</p> <p>Di Matteo is expected to take charge of the first team until the end of the season, when a long-term successor for Villas-Boas will be appointed. Chelsea's hierarchy is deliberating over potential candidates.</p> <p>Rafael Ben\u00edtez is unlikely to be considered, particularly given the negative reaction by the club's supporters at St Andrew's to the Spaniard's interest in the position, though Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola \u2013 potentially optimistic targets \u2013 will be sounded out. The need to qualify for the Champions League next season remains paramount and has been prioritised within the club, not least by Di Matteo in terms of team selection.</p> <p>Terry will hope to prove his fitness against Stoke before next week's second leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Napoli, which Chelsea trail 3-1 from the first game at the Stadio San Paolo. The captain has not played since the fourth-round FA Cup victory at QPR in late January. \"Once I had the operation, I was literally jogging about after two days, which was incredible,\" he added. \"I said to the physios, the way things were here, I just wanted to push myself and be involved and try to get back as quickly as possible.</p> <p>\"I've done that, worked really hard in the gym, been on triple sessions going back late in the evening on my own as well \u2013 which has been tough. The target for myself was always to get back and hopefully be back for the Stoke game, so this is a massive boost for me.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Carter is one of those films that is so stultifying, so oppressive and so mysteriously and interminably long that I felt as if someone had dragged me into the kitchen of my local Greggs, and was baking my head into the centre of a colossal cube of white bread. As the film went on, the loaf around my skull grew to the size of a basketball, and then a coffee table, and then an Audi. The boring and badly acted sci-fi mashup continued inexorably, and the bready blandness pressed into my nostrils, eardrums, eye sockets and mouth. I wanted to cry for help, but in bread no one can hear you scream. Finally, I clawed the doughy, gooey, tasteless mass desperately away from my mouth and screeched: \"Jesus, I'm watching a pointless film about a 1860s American civil war action hero on Mars, which the inhabitants apparently call Barsoom. I can't breathe.\" It is based on a fantasy-romance serial by Edgar Rice Burroughs from 1912, A Princess of Mars, and is adapted and directed by the renowned Pixar-Disney talent Andrew Stanton, notable for having worked on animated gems such as Wall-E, Toy Story, Monsters Inc and Up. But this heavy, airless film doesn't have a fraction of the wit, fun and imagination of those films. Something in the wacky fusion of period drama and interplanetary travel multiplies the gravitational force a thousand times, dragging everything down. Taylor Kitsch plays John Carter, a bone-weary civil war veteran and lone-wolf tough guy who we first see in Arizona, prospecting for gold in territory where there are Apaches. Carter fought for the Confederacy, and he is masculine, reticent and polite with the womenfolk, but a ferocious battler against those who would seek to circumscribe his liberty. And then, of all the crazy things, a golden amulet with runic occult symbols whooshes Carter off to Mars \u2013 that is, Barsoom. Anyway, Carter finds that he can leap tall mountains with a single bound, but becomes captured by creatures called Tharks. They live in the shadow of two warring humanoid tribes, the evil and tyrannous Zodangans who are oppressing the Heliumites, from Helium, with whose beautiful Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) Carter is soon to fall in love. Might it be that Barsoom has parallels with the Earthly strife that Carter has just lived through? \"Let red man kill red man until only Tharks remain,\" says one, and it could be that Tharks are the Native Americans, and the Zodangans and the Heliumites are the civil war belligerents. But which is which? And is there any equivalent of America's slavery? No \u2013 unless you count the bondage suffered by proud Carter himself on that fierce red planet. This film can't go 10 minutes without one of this nation's character actors striding on saying something ridiculous in a silly outfit with a straight face. Dominic West, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, Mark Strong, James Purefoy \u2013 all lend the story some exotic Brit classiness. Strong plays one of the all-powerful Therns, a sinister priestly caste of intergalactic puppet-masters, seeking to control everything that goes on. Hinds is Tardos Mors, leader of the Heliumites and West is Sab Than, of the wicked and opportunist Zodangans. Their clothes look like a mix of Roman and Aztec, sometimes with a quasi-Greek singlet, usually associated with a high priest about to sacrifice a small animal. They are also pretty keen on guyliner. The fact that some characters are from Helium might lead you to hope that they will release some balloon animals, or at least enliven the story by speaking in a squeaky-high voice. Many of the solemn lines could well have been improved by being delivered in a gaseous nasal falsetto: \"If Helium falls, so does Barsoom!\"; \"Will you stay and fight \u2013 for Helium?\" But this struggle is merely the backdrop to the love story between Carter and Dejah Thoris, and Carter's ability to fly means he can impress the princess by catching her in mid-air like Superman with Lois Lane, or David Copperfield with Claudia Schiffer. But Dejah, with her seen-it-all-before smirk, is not a very sympathetic heroine, and Kitsch is stolid and dull. And as for the red planet, the answer to David Bowie's famous question is no. What a sadd'ning bore it is.",

      "bodyText": "If such a thing as a racing certainty still exists in these turbulent times for rock and pop, then Michael Kiwanuka's debut album may well be it. It's always unwise to make predictions about these things, but there's no getting around the fact that the 24-year-old's music ticks a lot of boxes on the list headed Things People Seem to Like These Days. Kiwanuka has links to the west London folk scene that spawned Laura Marling and Mumford and Sons: he is signed to Communion, the record label owned by the latter's bassist, Ben Lovett. He is a confessional singer-songwriter in an age dominated by Adele: in the absence of a collapsed relationship to feel anguished about, Kiwanuka's songs concern themselves with matters spiritual \u2013 of which more later \u2013 and, on the mournful Always Waiting, the apparently insufferable torment of his pre-fame job. \"My load a burden that I carry \u2026 my time is coming \u2026 pray for me,\" he sings, perhaps making more of a song and dance about the awfulness of being a session guitarist for Chipmunk than is strictly necessary. Even at his least interesting, as on the title track, what Kiwanuka sounds like isn't one of the hallowed 60s and 70s names trotted out in every feature about him \u2013 Bill Withers or Terry Callier \u2013 but the laid-back, rounded-edge acoustic rock of Jack Johnson. Given that that sound inexplicably seems to have become a chart-pop touchstone thanks to the success of Bruno Mars, the bean-counters at his record label presumably think that's no bad thing. Most obviously, Kiwanuka's music fits the post-Amy Winehouse vogue for faux-vintage soul. It signposts its retro intentions from its opening seconds \u2013 the first thing you hear is a jazzy flute in a style not dissimilar to that of Rahsaan Roland Kirk. In fact, there's jazz flute all over the shop, along with saxophones blowing free solos and string and brass arrangements that so obviously recall the early 70s \u2013 not just Bill Withers or Terry Callier, but Van Morrison's Moondance and Nick Drake's Bryter Layter \u2013 you listen in fear that the whole thing might suddenly grind to a halt because the miners are out and the power stations have shut down. Home Again's strength lies in the fact that it manages to tick a lot of boxes without sounding like it set out to tick a lot of boxes. It seems a faintly ridiculous thing to say about an album that's so clearly busting a gut to sound 40 years older than it actually is, but it feels natural rather than forced or calculating. That's partly down to Paul Butler's production. It's perhaps a bit much to coat Kiwanuka's vocals in a thin layer of distortion \u2013 a kind of sonic equivalent of distressing furniture with sandpaper \u2013 with the implicit accompanying suggestion this music has recently been unearthed in the vaults of Blue Thumb or Cadet Records rather than recorded on the Isle of Wight last year with the bloke out of the Bees, but there's something beguiling about its warm, live sound. Mostly, though, it's down to Kiwanuka's voice and songs. The former is rich and fluid, the latter balance a sure grasp of an immediate melody against chord sequences that shift in ways you don't quite anticipate. Listening to Tell Me a Tale or I Won't Lie, you're struck by the way they manage to sound both comfortingly familiar and slightly unexpected, an impressive trick to pull off. Those old enough to remember an era when British rock music, like the Blair administration, didn't really do God might raise an eyebrow at how much of Home Again seems to deal with Christianity. Kiwanuka addresses The Lord with such frequency that you picture Him hiding behind the sofa and pretending to be out. At first, it just sounds like a lyrical tic, but by the time you reach I'm Getting Ready \u2013 \"to believe\" \u2013 it's pretty clear that it runs substantially deeper than that. There was a time when an album so explicitly God-bothering might have risked turning mainstream UK buyers off, although Kiwanuka might reasonably point out that most of the music that inspired him was exactly the same. Perhaps more pertinently, you could add that Mumford and Sons' links to evangelical Christianity and \"awake my soul, you were made to meet your maker\" lyrics have done nothing to harm their popularity in the UK and may well have contributed to it in the US: there are certainly a lot of American bloggers excited by the band's ability to provide \"moments of worship\" in their music. Back home, top of the list of Things People Seem to Like These Days is a certain earnestness and sincerity in their music: Home Again ticks that box as well.",

      "bodyText": "There are musical myths \u2013 and then there's Carlos Kleiber. The conductor \u2013 voted last year by 100 members of his profession as the greatest of all time, ever, in BBC Music Magazine \u2013 was, even before his death in 2004, the embodiment of the enigmatic reclusive genius \u2013 the maestro who, as Herbert von Karajan put it, would only conduct when his freezer was empty. A thumbnail of the Kleiber myths goes something like this: he was the \"perfect conducting machine\", in Gunther Schuller's words, who hardly ever conducted; he was a musical genius who knew the entire orchestral and operatic repertoire but only had a tiny selection of pieces he ever played in public; he was one of the funniest, most communicative musicians who ever lived, but never gave an interview; he was tormented by the ghost of his father, the great conductor Erich Kleiber; and he once gave a concert as long as his fee was a new Audi A8 with all the trimmings. There are grains of truth in all of those (the Audi one is definitely true), but there's much, much more to Kleiber than the myth-making. At least there is now, thanks to Charles Barber's astonishing new book, Corresponding with Carlos: A Biography of Carlos Kleiber. Charles had a unique relationship with Kleiber. As a conducting student at Stanford University, with dazzling boldness and naivety, he wrote to Kleiber out of the blue and said he wanted to study with him. The key was Barber's use of humour and irony to attempt to elicit a response from Kleiber \u2013 it worked. Barber never formally became a student of Kleiber's (nobody ever did), but from 1989 until the maestro's death, he corresponded with the supposedly unknowable Carlos, and as well as vivid account of Kleiber's life, Barber's book publishes pretty well the complete letters he received. And they're a revelation. Kleiber proves as virtuosically funny and self-deprecating as he was incandescent on the podium. \"The bottom line always seems to be: no one on earth can tell you anything accurate or intelligent about conductors, least of all musicians, critics, and \u2026 CONDUCTORS, including yours sincerely. Why? Because all and sundry don't have the faintest, including, again, me.\" The bulk of the exchange centres on the films of the great maestros of yesteryear that Barber was collating for his Conductors on Film collection, which he sent \u2013 51 video tapes in all \u2013 to Kleiber. Carlos's responses are fascinating, his letters executing pirouettes of musical and literary meaning in nearly every sentence, and each disproving his own maxim that he can't say anything meaningful about his life's work. On how listening to Duke Ellington gave him the clue about how to conduct Beethoven's Coriolan Overture: \"The Duke and I whipped a downbeat sans upbeat out of nowhere for the start and similar 'starts', making it sound like running into a wall at 60mph with a Rolls-Royce, OK?\" On conducting from memory: \"'Doing' a piece 'from memory' is something your Aunt Sally would have no trouble with. Knowing exactly what is (supposed to be) going on is something, I believe, only [Dimitri] Mitropoulos could honestly claim to. With the right band in a good, condescending mood, there'd be no audible difference between Sally and Dimitri, if Sally had digested the overall ductus.\" There's also real insight into his way of thinking about music's relationship with the world. He loved Emily Dickinson, and often quotes her poetry in the letters, saying he was the reincarnation of her dog, Carlo, and (quixotically, but passionately) hated Abraham Lincoln \u2013 something Barber tries and fails to change his mind on. Above all, Kleiber worked. Hard. The clue to the supposedly mystical power of Kleiber's conducting proves not so elusive after all: as Barber's book shows, he worked more fastidiously and more intensely when he did conduct than any other musician, studying the manuscript, where possible, of every piece he played, and listening to every performance he could gets his hands on. Barber's book does more than any other I know to simultaneously reveal the truth behind the Kleiber myths and to illuminate the deeper mystery of how his recordings and films continue to have such a talismanic power. This is a brilliant summary of Kleiber's way of making music, I think: \"When he heard a piece in his mind, he saw each phrase in all its iterations moving nearer to the originating code of conception \u2013 perhaps just a single note. His rehearsals operated the same way, always moving toward an infinite point of truth just over there, just past the visible horizon. And he worked in the opposite direction, simultaneously \u2026 When he beat the first bar of a great work, in his mind he was already in the last.\" Still not a Kleiber convert? Then do as Charles says, and start by watching Kleiber conduct a Strauss waltz from one of the two New Year's Day concerts he conducted with the Vienna Philharmonic, Die Libelle, which is a miniature masterclass in, well, virtually all you need to know about great conducting; about the poetic, alchemical connection between gesture and sound. And then watch his Beethoven symphonies, the Fourth and the Seventh, with the Concertgebouw \u2013 and you'll never look back. For the serious Kleiberophile, YouTube has some truly amazing things: volodya2 has uploaded rare rehearsal footage of him conducting Strauss's Rosenkavalier in Vienna in 1994, and Wagner's Tristan in Stuttgart in 1970; and the conductor who never gave an interview gives an interview here! The only one he ever did do, admittedly, but there it is, in German, in all its five minutes of glory. Even better, here is the complete film of the terrifyingly powerful performance of Verdi's Otello with Domingo at La Scala in 1976; and for good measure here's my personal favourite at the moment: his frighteningly moving Brahms's Second Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic. Barber talks about Kleiber as a perfectionist and an ecstatic. If the perfectionism was his curse \u2013 the impossibly high standards that he felt he never truly reached \u2013 it's the ecstasy that we're left with. As Barber says: \"I glory in the fact that he was able to make his miracles at all. Lucky him. Lucky, lucky us.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain has no current plans to support rebels inside Syria, the foreign secretary, William Hague, has said. His comments came despite indications that the US is considering doing so. The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, said on Wednesday that the Obama administration was considering \"an array of non-lethal assistance\" to rebels trying to overthrow the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. However, in his evidence to the foreign affairs select committee, Hague said Britain would only continue to supply non-lethal assistance to \"peaceful\" opposition outside Syria. \"I haven't ruled out giving more non-lethal help, but we haven't countenanced doing that beyond groups that are so far located outside Syria and are trying to pursue a peaceful democratic opposition,\" he told MPs. One of the constraints was concern that equipment could fall into the hands of al-Qaida, which is now reported to be operating inside the country, Hague said. No 10 had earlier described the defection of the Syrian deputy oil minister, Abdo Hussameldin to, in his words, \"join the revolution of this dignified people\", as an \"important moment\". Hague said negotiations in New York this week over a UN security council resolution calling for an end to the violence were \"difficult\" because of continued opposition from Russia and China. Given their reluctance, he said it would not be realistic to get a stronger resolution calling for the international criminal court to try Assad and other key figures in the regime, who were compared by the committee member Sir John Stanley to the Nazi \"SS extermination squads\". Russia and China were paying a \"diplomatic price\" throughout the Arab world for having used their vetoes to block a previous attempt to agree a resolution, Hague said. \"If our view is correct that the Assad regime cannot recover its credibility internationally or internally after spilling so much blood and that, one way or another, it is doomed, then it is in the national interest of Russia and China to support a political transition at some stage,\" he added. Britain was continuing to work for a UN security council resolution based on an Arab League plan calling for Assad to step down, paving the way for the transition to a new government, he said. \"The violent overthrow of the Assad regime has unknowable consequences for that region and neighbouring countries, similarly the successful violent repression of opposition by Assad's regime leaves a totally unsustainable situation and also is a threat to peace and stability in that region,\" Hague explained. He also played down the prospect of opening up international humanitarian aid corridors into Syria, saying it would require \"overwhelming military force\" unless the Syrian government was prepared to allow access \u2013 something it has so far refused.",

      "bodyText": "Apple is the embodiment of the knowledge-based economy. It is America's biggest stock-market quoted company, and with the advent of the iPad 3 will be adding to the 100m in tablet sales it has already chalked up. Yet it employs just 47,000 people \u2013 a tiny fraction of the workforce in its home state. While California proudly hosts the paragons of the new economy \u2013 Google, Intel, eBay and Cisco \u2013 it suffers from 11.1% unemployment. Is a knowledge-based economy also a jobless one? When General Motors was America's biggest company it employed more than 600,000 people. Semi-skilled workers could earn decent wages, with pensions and healthcare benefits to boot. An eco-system of suppliers generated many more jobs and helped build the world's most prosperous middle class. Does Apple show that a hi-tech new economy enriches just a few and hollows out the rest? It's not the only \"designed in America, built in China\" tech giant to employ few people on its home turf. Google has just 24,400, and eBay only 17,700. Apple is mindful of accusations over jobs. Last week it issued a study claiming it has \"created or supported\" 514,000 jobs in the US. This includes 210,000 jobs connected to the creation of apps, plus 304,000 in such roles as making \"planes and trucks that carry our products to our customers\". Some economists argue that taking credit for such jobs is stretching Apple's halo towards the limit. But other economists highlight how in areas of the US where tech dominates, it goes hand-in-hand with huge income disparities. San Jose, home to Silicon Valley, is the second worst city in the US for income inequality, according to a study by the Martin Prosperity Institute, with San Francisco not far behind. Hi-tech brings winner-takes-all wealth to a few, but creates little for the traditional middle class, says the report's author Richard Florida. \"The job market has literally cleaved in two. On one side are high-paying, professional, knowledge and creative jobs that require considerable education and skill. But the number of lower-wage jobs in fields like personal care, retail sales and food service is expanding even faster.\" A more benign interpretation focuses on the boom-bust nature of IT in the US. Jobs in California soared during the dotcom bubble between 1997 and 2000, then peeled away.The financial crisis also hit Silicon Valley hard, as companies deferred major capital expenditure on new technology. But economist Ross DeVol of independent thinktank The Milken Institute is more optimistic than others about a jobs recovery. He says jobs growth in California is running at 2%, compared to 1.2% in the rest of the US. \"Hi-tech is still the unique engine of the US economy, and now we are in the midst of an upcycle,\" he adds. \"California has a unique innovation eco-system based around its universities such as Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA, CalTech, USC and Irvine. Yes, it can be a high-cost state, and yes manufacturing jobs go offshore, but the engineers are resident here.\" He blames much of California's job woes on the sub-prime mortgage industry \"which was virtually headquartered in southern California\". When the bust came, the state suffered disproportionately from both the loss of construction and finance jobs. Today the Bay area around San Francisco remains the beating heart of new business start-ups in the US tech sector. This small corner of one US state attracts, astonishingly, 46% of all the venture capital in the entire US, says DeVol. \"If anything, venture capital has become more concentrated in California than before the recession,\" he says. The focus of many start-ups is social media, the third \"mega trend\" driving the hi-tech sector, according to Justin Kistner of consultancy Webtrends. The first wave was about connecting to the web, which saw the rise of AOL; the second was search, which gave birth to Google; the third is social media, with Facebook (number of employees \"3,000+\" according to the company's website) moving swiftly to total dominance. \"Facebook probably has two to three years before it reaches its peak, and there is probably another five years before it is replaced by the next mega trend,\" Kistner predicts. Meanwhile, he says, Google is destined to head the way of Microsoft \u2013 cash generative but no longer at the forefront of the internet. At companies in the Bay area, Facebook and social media are the focus of almost every discussion. At salesforce.com, a company using Cloud computing to bring more efficient software and marketing tools for corporates, the talk is of its social media application, called Chatter, creating the next wave of sales. But at Autodesk, virtually a granddaddy in the local tech sector at 30 years old, visitors are shown the extraordinary technological leap that might, just, eventually lead to the return of manufacturing jobs to the west. Autodesk specialises in design software, largely for architects, builders and engineers. Now it's working to develop 3D printing. If that sounds innocuous, it's not. 3D printing is not about pieces of paper that have a 3D look to them. It's about printers that actually \"print\" in three dimensions. It means that a printer squirts resins and metals instead of ink to physically produce goods. Autodesk's showroom features items from vases to seat springs made by the printer. It even displays an entire motorbike made of parts \"printed\" by a 3D printer. The last generation has seen jobs flee east. Maybe the next will see products made much closer to home. The next manufacturing revolution might well be in your garage. Patrick Collinson was a guest on a trip organised for the British press by Neptune Investment Management.",

      "body": "<p>Apple is the embodiment of the knowledge-based economy. It is America's biggest stock-market quoted company, and with the advent of the iPad 3 will be adding to the 100m in tablet sales it has already chalked up. Yet it employs just 47,000 people \u2013 a tiny fraction of the workforce in its home state.</p> <p>While California proudly hosts the paragons of the new economy \u2013 Google, Intel, eBay and Cisco \u2013 it suffers from 11.1% unemployment. Is a knowledge-based economy also a jobless one?</p> <p>When General Motors was America's biggest company it employed more than 600,000 people. Semi-skilled workers could earn decent wages, with pensions and healthcare benefits to boot. An eco-system of suppliers generated many more jobs and helped build the world's most prosperous middle class.</p> <p>Does Apple show that a hi-tech new economy enriches just a few and hollows out the rest? It's not the only \"designed in America, built in China\" tech giant to employ few people on its home turf. Google has just 24,400, and eBay only 17,700.</p> <p>Apple is mindful of accusations over jobs. Last week it <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/about/job-creation/\" title=\"\">issued a study</a> claiming it has \"created or supported\" 514,000 jobs in the US. This includes 210,000 jobs connected to the creation of apps, plus 304,000 in such roles as making \"planes and trucks that carry our products to our customers\". Some economists argue that taking credit for such jobs is stretching Apple's halo towards the limit.</p> <p>But other economists highlight how in areas of the US where tech dominates, it goes hand-in-hand with huge income disparities. San Jose, home to Silicon Valley, is the second worst city in the US for income inequality, according to a <a href=\"http://m.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/03/inequality-american-cities/861/\" title=\"The Inequality of American Cities\">study by the Martin Prosperity Institute</a>, with San Francisco not far behind. Hi-tech brings winner-takes-all wealth to a few, but creates little for the traditional middle class, says the report's author Richard Florida.</p> <p>\"The job market has literally cleaved in two.&#xa0;On one side are high-paying, professional, knowledge and creative jobs that require considerable education and skill. But the number of lower-wage jobs in fields like personal care, retail sales and food service is expanding even faster.\"</p> <p>A more benign interpretation focuses on the boom-bust nature of IT in the US. Jobs in California soared during the dotcom bubble between 1997 and 2000, then peeled away.The financial crisis also hit Silicon Valley hard, as companies deferred major capital expenditure on new technology.</p> <p>But economist Ross DeVol of independent thinktank <a href=\"http://www.milkeninstitute.org/\" title=\"Milken Institute website\">The Milken Institute</a> is more optimistic than others about a jobs recovery. He says jobs growth in California is running at 2%, compared to 1.2% in the rest of the US. \"Hi-tech is still the unique engine of the US economy, and now we are in the midst of an upcycle,\" he adds. \"California has a unique innovation eco-system based around its universities such as Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA, CalTech, USC and Irvine. Yes, it can be a high-cost state, and yes manufacturing jobs go offshore, but the engineers are resident here.\"</p> <p>He blames much of California's job woes on the sub-prime mortgage industry \"which was virtually headquartered in southern California\". When the bust came, the state suffered disproportionately from both the loss of construction and finance jobs.</p> <p>Today the Bay area around San Francisco remains the beating heart of new business start-ups in the US tech sector. This small corner of one US state attracts, astonishingly, 46% of all the venture capital in the entire US, says DeVol. \"If anything, venture capital has become more concentrated in California than before the recession,\" he says.</p> <p>The focus of many start-ups is social media, the third \"mega trend\" driving the hi-tech sector, according to Justin Kistner of consultancy <a href=\"http://webtrends.com/\">Webtrends</a>.

Singing, dancing and eating together are also part of this fire festival, known as Chaharshanbe Suri. But for many Iranians, this prehistoric Persian event goes far beyond being just a cultural celebration. Especially for the young, it provides an opportunity to vent frustrations at the government. Ever since the revolution of 1979, the Islamic republic has stood firm in opposing popular festivals, including those from Iran's pre-Islamic period, seeing them as superstitious, illogical and anti-Islamic. The restrictions on social and cultural events were eased slightly under reformist President Khatami \u2013 but since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took office in 2005, the crackdown has grown stronger than ever, with many being arrested and hospitalised. In the last few years, Chaharshanbe Suri has been used as an excuse for people to pour onto the streets en masse and voice their opinions on issues ranging from the dire economic situation to social freedom. In 2009, hundreds of thousands of Iranians threw Molotov cocktails and firecrackers in the streets to show their anger at the government. In recent years, many Iranians have used the festival to demonstrate against the Islamic Republic's restrictions. This year, the head of the country's national security forces, Esmail Ahmadi-Moghaddam, said he didn't have a problem with people enjoying themselves but would arrest anyone who joins gatherings. For most Iranians, this year has not been the kindest. With sanctions, unemployment, inflation and threats of war, many feel they are not being heard and will step out onto the streets on the night of Chaharshanbeh Suri.

Since Rangers entered administration on 14 February only two senior management figures \u2013 Gordon Smith and Ali Russell \u2013 have lost their jobs. Two players, Mervan Celik and Gregg Wylde, have left Ibrox of their own accord. Talks between Rangers players and administrators about significant pay drops have yet to be resolved and on Tuesday administrators painted their bleakest picture yet of the off-field Rangers situation. David Whitehouse, Rangers' joint administrator, said: \"There has been comment on the decision-making process and whether so-called tough decisions should have been taken earlier in the process, such as making players redundant. This would not have been a tough decision \u2013 it would have been folly. \"The scale of the cost-cutting required is very substantial indeed \u2013 and making a few players redundant along the way would not have achieved the necessary savings. \"Furthermore, we are striving to strike a balance where we retain valuable assets of the business such as players, both for their performance and their potential value and this strategy is understood by major stakeholders.\" Rangers need to save in the region of \u00a31m a month before the end of this season. Whitehouse added: \"As administrators, we believe that most Rangers supporters will understand that from the moment the club went into administration every effort has been made to keep the business alive. \"The reality is that the perilous cash position of the club meant that even staging games was a major challenge and required a substantial collaborative effort between the administration team, the club staff and suppliers who have certainly gone the extra mile.\" As expected, the high court in London has delayed a decision on whether \u00a33.6m secured from a lawyer's account \u2013 earlier controlled by the Rangers owner, Craig Whyte \u2013 should be handed over to the club. With other parties, including Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, making a claim on the funds, they will be subject to a four-day hearing from 30 March. \"If we are successful in retrieving these funds that will help the recovery process of the club and will be an important step towards the club emerging from administration,\" Whitehouse said. \"No one should be in any doubt, however, about the overall financial situation of the club and every effort is being made to ensure its survival. \"We are continuing to meet prospective purchasers over the next few days.

      "bodyText": "Finnish startup Rovio Entertainment has confirmed the details of its new Angry Birds Space game, which will launch on 22 March on iPhone, iPad, Android, PC and Mac. The company has been working with NASA on the launch to spectacular effect, getting flight engineer Don Pettit to introduce the game from the International Space Station, in a video posted online. The game will launch with 60 levels, six new characters and superpowers, and gameplay features based on its zero-gravity setting. Rovio says new levels will be added as free updates, as in previous Angry Birds games, but also as in-app purchases. National Geographic Books will publish an official companion book for Angry Birds Space, while there will also be animation and retail elements to the launch. Rovio says information on other gaming platforms beyond those listed above will be available \"later\". \"This collaboration began with a simple Twitter exchange about birds and pigs in space, and it has grown into a tremendous outreach and education opportunity,\" says NASA's associate administrator for communications David Weaver. \"Games are fun and entertaining, but they also can be inspirational and informative. This ongoing collaboration with Rovio and Angry Birds is an exciting way to get people engaged with NASA's missions of exploration and discovery, and get students energized about future careers in science and technology.\" The actual Angry Birds Space game is being shown publicly for the first time on 9 March at the SXSWi conference in Austin, Texas. Not on an iPhone or iPad, though: Rovio will be demonstrating the new game on Samsung's Galaxy Note, as part of its marketing partnership with the device manufacturer. Rovio is hoping its latest game \u2013 the first new Angry Birds title in a year \u2013 will continue the franchise's phenomenal success. It has so far generated 700m downloads across all platforms, while the company has sold 25m plush toys and signed deals for more than 20,000 licensed products. In an interview with The Guardian at Mobile World Congress in February 2012, Rovio's marketing chief Peter Vesterbacka outlined the company's ambitions for the new game. \"It's the first time we have everything available on launch day: animation, toys, books, candy, everything. It's massive: most Hollywood movies don't have this. And this is just the first phase of our space programme. There is more to come.\" Here's that International Space Station announcement:",

      "body": "<p>Finnish startup Rovio Entertainment has confirmed the details of its new Angry Birds Space game, which will launch on 22 March on iPhone, iPad, Android, PC and Mac.</p> <p>The company has been working with NASA on the launch to spectacular effect, getting flight engineer Don Pettit to introduce the game from the International Space Station, in a <a href=\"http://space.angrybirds.com/\">video posted online</a>.</p> <p>The game will launch with 60 levels, six new characters and superpowers, and gameplay features based on its zero-gravity setting. Rovio says new levels will be added as free updates, as in previous Angry Birds games, but also as in-app purchases.</p> <p>National Geographic Books will publish an official companion book for Angry Birds Space, while there will also be animation and retail elements to the launch. Rovio says information on other gaming platforms beyond those listed above will be available \"later\".</p> <p>\"This collaboration began with a simple Twitter exchange about birds and pigs in space, and it has grown into a tremendous outreach and education opportunity,\" says NASA's associate administrator for communications David Weaver.</p> <p>\"Games are fun and entertaining, but they also can be inspirational and informative. This ongoing collaboration with Rovio and Angry Birds is an exciting way to get people engaged with NASA's missions of exploration and discovery, and get students energized about future careers in science and technology.\"</p> <p>The actual Angry Birds Space game is being shown publicly for the first time on 9 March at the SXSWi conference in Austin, Texas. Not on an iPhone or iPad, though: Rovio will be demonstrating the new game on Samsung's Galaxy Note, as part of its marketing partnership with the device manufacturer.</p> <p>Rovio is hoping its latest game \u2013 the first new Angry Birds title in a year \u2013 will continue the franchise's phenomenal success. It has so far generated 700m downloads across all platforms, while the company has sold 25m plush toys and signed deals for more than 20,000 licensed products.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/mar/01/angry-birds-peter-vesterbacka-rovio\">interview with The Guardian</a> at Mobile World Congress in February 2012, Rovio's marketing chief Peter Vesterbacka outlined the company's ambitions for the new game.</p> <p>\"It's the first time we have everything available on launch day: animation, toys, books, candy, everything. It's massive: most Hollywood movies don't have this. And this is just the first phase of our space programme. There is more to come.\"</p> <p>Here's that International Space Station announcement:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxI1L1RiSJQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"264\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/lxI1L1RiSJQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/lxI1L1RiSJQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "There are plenty of men in east Africa with guns and armies, plenty of brutal militia and bandits, but only one of them, Joseph Kony, is an internet celebrity, one of the world's most visible villains. Charities now understand a maxim \u2013 the advertisers' maxim \u2013 that to be successful, a campaign has to go viral. The Kony 2012 film is undeniably powerful, if faintly kitsch, but it has accrued more than 26m views on YouTube in two days. Yesterday, \"Invisible Children\", \"#StopKony\", \"Uganda\", and \"LRA\" all made it into the top 10 trending topics worldwide on Twitter. Make Poverty History campaigners were the original viral grassroots marketers in the charity world and Kony 2012 is very much their spiritual successor; from the slick video to the merchandising and right-on street parties. There are even branded wristbands (\"one for you, and one to give to a friend\"), and posters are designed by the same artist as the Hope poster for Obama's 2008 election campaign. But Kony 2012 has also suffered a backlash. People have attacked the charity running the campaign, Invisible Children, on technical issues, including how much it spends on the campaigns and filmmaking, compared with how much it sends to Africa. Many of these complaints are down to misinformation, and the charity answered them here. But there have been ideological criticisms too. People appear to resent the idea that an NGO should also be an activist group, especially one that appears to be calling for military intervention. How dare they? They should stick to building schools, and leave the politics to the politicians; even, in some cases, Africa to the Africans. Paradoxically, Invisible Children is also being attacked from the other side entirely, by people saying that the campaign excuses people from engaging with a complex issue in a serious way, calling it \"dumbing down\" and accusing the makers of being naive. But it is unfair to expect campaigners to desist simply on the basis that their campaign is idealistic. Few of us have the clout that governments wield. As most of the people pledging their support to the Kony 2012 campaign don't have the military force or political influence to change the world, they are calling on their governments to do something on their behalf. That's how politics works. Additionally, a campaign is not supposed to be nuanced. This is the internet, and if you're going to be successful you have to think in slightly blunt terms. UN briefing documents of 500 pages rarely go viral. Of course the situation is not as simple as the film implies. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is not the only bandit group in east Africa, though it may have a claim to be the most brutal. They are not operating in a vacuum either, and it has been alleged that the beleaguered north Sudanese government is supplying Kony in order to disrupt newly independent South Sudan. This would hardly be out of character for Khartoum. And it is hardly Africa's least-covered issue. The LRA has featured as villains in several Hollywood movies, including Casino Royale and the more recent Machine Gun Preacher. The international criminal court already has a warrant out for Kony's arrest \u2013 it was the first they ever issued \u2013 and the Ugandan and South Sudanese militaries aren't exactly his biggest fans. Even so, the allies that Invisible Children have made are hardly admirable. The Ugandan army is under investigation by the ICC for alleged atrocities committed during the country's civil war, and the Sudan People's Liberation Army is accused of similar outrages. But that's for the government to weigh up and decide. In the meantime, any activist group is perfectly free to call for whatever it likes, and appeal for popular support for their campaign. Lobbying is not restricted to lobbyists by law. Anything that shines a light on the atrocities that are an almost daily occurrence in this region is a good thing \u2013 and with millions watching the video and joining the discussion, this aim has been achieved. If this campaign contributes to Kony being brought to justice, that is a real, tangible, important achievement. As well as stopping a brutal and bloodthirsty bandit, it may also send a signal to others that they are unable to operate with impunity any more in east Africa \u2013 and, perhaps more importantly, it might send a signal to people there that the world has a stake in their lives. It could work, actually. The film states that it \"expires\" on 31 December 2012, and it is good that the campaigners are aware of the temporary nature of an internet campaign, and can use it to their advantage. Even if Kony is still at large at the end of this year, some of the message will have got through to people. In fact, the power of the internet is that, in just two days, much of it already has. \u2022 This article was commissioned after a suggestion by EwanBryson",

      "bodyText": "Swedish National Television \u2013 Sweden's equivalent to the BBC \u2013 recently screened an expose on the Swedish competition to find a Eurovision entry. The core accusation was that the producer of the show was able to influence which songs and artists would be entered in the regional competitions \u2013 and he tended to favour professional songwriters and known artists. Participants in the show declared this just wasn't fair, as each submission should be considered on the quality of the song. What would they have said about the UK's \"selection process\"? Last week the BBC announced it had chosen 75-year-old crooner Engelbert Humperdinck to represent the UK in Eurovision 2012. It said the song he would perform was to be written by Martin Terefe \u2013 the Grammy-winning producer behind Jason Mraz's I'm Yours and Train's Soul Sister \u2013 and Sacha Skarbek \u2013 who writes and produces for Adele, Lana Del Rey, and co-wrote James Blunt's You're Beautiful). I'm Swedish and Melodifestivalen (the Swedish tryouts for Eurovision) has been part of Sweden's cultural fabric ever since Abba won in 1974. In the 90s it experienced a bit of a slump, but for the past decade much of the Swedish music scene has been dominated by the local competitions. For six weeks before the European final, tryouts around the country are televised in a primetime Saturday night slot, with more than a third of the population watching. Both new and established artists \u2013 even serious actors \u2013 take part (imagine Jarvis Cocker and Ewan McGregor competing with Dappy to represent the UK). Swedish songwriters and producers have experienced huge international success in the last couple of decades. Max Martin, RedOne (who's actually Moroccan, but launched his career in Sweden), Shellback, Jorgen Elofsson, Swedish House Mafia and many more have contributed to the global charts so heavily that rarely a week goes by without a song written by a Swede entering the top 10 somewhere in the world. Eurovision is no exception to the Swedish invasion. The old rules that required composers of entered songs to come from the country they represented have loosened, and now Swedish writers are responsible for songs for Russia, Ireland, Spain, Romania and Norway. Last year's winner was co-written by a Swede, and Terefe, who is writing Humperdinck's song, is Swedish. Eurovision is largely viewed as a joke in Britain \u2013 a reason to laugh at our European neighbours \u2013 but maybe Swedes are on to something. Opportunities for British artists to perform on mainstream television have disappeared since the demise of shows such as Top of the Pops. Apart from Later \u2026 With Jools Holland, all we have are talk shows, which usually only feature one established major label artist per show, and The X Factor, which features big stars and contestants singing covers. A show like Sweden's Melodifestival could be a real shot in the arm for new music. Britain is responsible for 12% of the world's music market and has an incredible music heritage, so why can't we send something more interesting to this year's contest in Azerbaijan? Who cares if we win or not, or if, as Terry Wogan claimed, eastern Europeans vote for each other. Any opportunity to expose new artists to an audience of millions (in the case of the Eurovision final, hundreds of millions), singing newly composed music should be taken. Who knows: maybe the opporutnities granted by Eurovision have played a part in the Swedish music phenomenon, way beyond Abba's win with Waterloo, almost 40 years ago.",

Simeon Langford made his own tools from screws removed from the desk in his cell, taping them to plastic forks, and spent weeks chiselling the mortar from the wall. He tried to fool officers at Exeter prison with his own papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mix, which he used to cover up the ever-growing hole in the wall of his cell. The escape attempt was only foiled when an officer inspecting the yard of the Victorian prison spotted a pile of dust and debris beneath his window. Langford was being held on remand after attacking three warders at another prison four days before he had been due to be released from an earlier sentence. He has only been out of jail for two months since he was 20 because he keeps attacking prison officers while serving sentences. The 28-year-old, of Bristol, admitted attempted escape, three assaults causing actual bodily harm and criminal damage. Judge Erik Salomonsen jailed him for 39 months, telling him: \"There was a routine inspection and brick dust was found beneath the outside wall \u2013 and after a search of your room, officers found plastic cutlery with screws attached, sheets, and paint. \"You had concealed what you were doing with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. This was an ingenious and inventive attempt, but was doomed to failure. \"You must remain in custody because the public must know, and prison officers must know, that if a serving prisoner commits assault against them, the inevitable sentence is imprisonment.\" Langford, who has a daughter, replied from the dock: \"Thank you for your understanding. I will try to serve my term and get out of jail so I can be a father to my kid. I hope I don't get beaten up too often.\" Howard Phillips, prosecuting, said Langford was close to release from Channings Wood prison, in Devon, in December 2010 when he wrecked his cell after being told he would have to wait for a requested meeting with the governor. He then armed himself with a chair leg and attacked the three officers sent in to restrain him, using the leg like a baseball bat, hitting one officer on the helmet, throttling him and biting him and hitting the others on the back or arms. He was transferred to Exeter prison in January 2011, and in the 22 days he was held there he broke through the inner and outer skins of the brick wall. Phillips said: \"It was quite an ingenious and determined attempt to escape. He was in the old Victorian part of the prison, which has a two-skin wall with relatively soft mortar. \"He dismantled a table in his cell and used screws from it and plastic cutlery to break up the mortar. \"He got through the first wall and started breaking through the second. He disguised this from officers by covering the hole with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and painting it so it looked perfectly normal. \"He was caught after a maintenance officer found brick dust under his window and a search was made of his cell where it was found the paint on the wall was still wet. \"It appears that even if he had broken through the wall he would have been rather short of a barbed wire fence outside and the perimeter wall beyond that.\" Julia Farrant, defending, said Langford's escape attempt was bound to fail because, even if he had got through the wall, he could not have got any further.",

Skins might seem \u2013 and indeed be \u2013 an excessive, unrealistic portrayal of teenage life but at times it has managed to pull some serious drama punches. Watching the first few series in my teens, moments really stuck with me: Tony's learning and emotional difficulties after being hit by a car; Freddie being unexpectedly beaten to death by a baseball bat. It still tackles pressing issues, such as mental health, teenage pregnancy and loathing your parents with its unique, quirky style. So why is Skins going now? A popular criticism is its bi-yearly cull, of everybody. You develop your favourites, your crushes, empathise with their issues and then \u2026 Bam! \u2026 all the characters are replaced by another lot. And the new guys are just never the same. You'll always think the generation you first saw were the best: as a self-loathing 16-year-old I admired (and had a crush on) the straight-acting-yet-gay Maxxie, was frustrated yet equally captivated by the confident and promiscuous Tony and intrigued by the unique yet vulnerable Cassie. Culling the entire cast every two series seemed alienating and unnecessary \u2013 and to an extent it was. But I entirely understand why Skins took this route: far better to leave characters behind than see them grow up, mature out and end up with them only experimenting with their tax return. The core of the show, its kind of youthful slightly sexually aggressive spark as it were, would have just gone, repelling the very sort of people it was trying to attract. (The special episodes next year will see Skins returning to some of its original characters. It's really not clear how successful that will be.) So was that first cast change the beginning of the end for Skins? Or did the show really just suffer from trying to match its earlier exploits? The first episode of the first series involved Tony stealing a car, before accidentally causing it to fall off the harbour-side with everyone still in it. This at a time when the most controversial dramatised TV teen event was the occasional Hollyoaks after the Watershed. But the problem that Skins had from the start was trying to sustain this endlessly hardcore, controversial rebellious vibe. And that vibe got tired, quickly. At the start of the current series for instance, we saw the newer Bristol crew driving a set of motorbikes throughout Morocco, getting drugged up to their eyeballs and gatecrashing a party. We've seen this whole kind of thing before. Many times. But the fact Skins ran out of steam shouldn't overshadow its successes. There have been many. Its removed some of the stigma around mental health issues, its never been patronising or moralistic around drink and drugs, it helped kick some of the stigma around sexuality and a remake of the show led to America being absolutely freaking horrified. But what do you think? Was the show exaggerated rubbish or will you truly miss it? And are you looking forward to catching up with old characters as they return to screen for a final goodbye?",

      "bodyText": "Householders at risk of flooding should take responsibility for preventing future damage to their homes despite the fact that this may not reduce the cost of their insurance or even guarantee that they can buy flood cover, the government has said. Richard Benyon, the minister for natural environment and fisheries, confirmed that a five-year agreement between the insurance industry and the government to ensure flood-hit householders can buy flood cover for their homes would not be renewed when it ends in June next year. \"Renewing [the agreement] would not solve the problem,\" Benyon said at a conference on flooding on Wednesday afternoon. \"The current agreement does not apply to the majority of households at significant flood risk, nor does it apply to homes built since January 2009. It provides no universal guarantee of flood cover, as many claim it does. Nor does the agreement influence the pricing of policies.\" The agreement, known as the Statement of Principles, is crucial for those households that have already been flooded as it means that insurers will continue to provide cover for existing customers, albeit at a higher premium, as long as the government continues to improve flood defences. However, following a substantial investment in flood defences by the Labour government, the current government has cut funding. The insurance industry believes the government has now reneged on its part of the deal and consequently it does not want to continue with the agreement, a situation that leaves thousands of households at risk of becoming uninsured by next summer. Benyon said households should instead be encouraged to invest in their own flood defences, including the installation of air brick covers, non-return valves and seals for cat flaps. Referring to a review of the government's scheme that provides home surveys for households at risk of flooding he said: \"The review has shown that property-level protection is cost-effective and the study has underlined the practical help and emotional reassurance that this form of protection gives to people who are at risk of flooding.\" However, he will also acknowledge in his speech that householders who improve their properties may still be unable to afford insurance. \"The lack of recognition by insurers of property-level protection is still a significant barrier to the wider take-up of such measures,\" he said. \"This is just one of the reasons why we are working together with the insurance industry towards the announcement in the spring of a new shared understanding which sets out more clearly what individual customers can expect from their insurer, and from government.\" It is unclear what the \"shared understanding\" will constitute, but Benyon will make it clear this afternoon that the government will not subsidise households' flood insurance. In other countries, flood risk is covered by the government or a partnership between the state and the insurance industry. In the US, for example, catastrophic flooding is typically excluded from private insurance policies for high-risk areas and is covered by a federal national flood insurance programme. The programme aims to make flood insurance available to those in areas of high flood risk. In France, the insurance industry collects a compulsory premium for natural disasters that is standard in policies and which is charged regardless of the level of risk. The state acts as the re-insurer and hence guarantees payments as the insurer of last resort. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said at the conference that it has put a proposal to the government that would see flood insurance offered through a pooling mechanism. \"Insurers will continue to manage most flood-related claims \u2013 helping people to get their lives back together following a flood. And entry into the scheme would be set at an agreed threshold,\" said James Dalton, assistant director of general insurance at the ABI. \"There would be no significant change to the way customers access insurance and a more competitive and innovative insurance market should emerge over time. The model allows for property-level resistance and resilience measures to be taken into account by insurers.\" He added: \"Naturally, how the government chooses to provide the support necessary for the scheme is up to them, but it could easily be funded by a small and formalised contribution from those purchasing home insurance.\" The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has also released a report at the conference that argues against insurers pricing out flood-hit households purely based on risk and calls for further government intervention. \"The purely market-based alternative threatens to leave many thousands of properties uninsurable, leading to extensive social blight,\" its authors say, concluding that \"there is an overwhelming case for rejecting a free market in flood insurance after 2013\". Charles Tucker, chairman of the National Flood Forum, the charity running the conference, said: \"We believe this gives overwhelming weight to the case for government to step up to the plate to ensure that the market in flood insurance is fair and equitable. On present evidence they need to do more.\" Gavin Shuker, the shadow minister for water and waste, said: \"'This Tory-led government is playing Russian roulette with people's homes and livelihoods. Catastrophic flood risk is something we all need to tackle together. \"Ultimately, catastrophic risk resides with us all \u2013 a denial of this basic political principle is like trying to deny gravity. It is short-sightedness of the worst kind. We need leadership from government in ensuring the flood investment is made, and to put in place a framework that will ensure high-risk homes are able to access the protection they need.\" What other countries are doing about flood risk France: There are constitutional guarantees of the principle of solidarity for natural disasters. The preamble to the 1946 constitution says: \"The nation shall proclaim the solidarity and equality of all the French people with respect to burdens resulting from national disasters.\" In practice, insurance is provided through a partnership between the state and the insurance industry. The insurance industry collects a compulsory premium for natural disasters that is standard in policies and which is charged regardless of the level of risk. The state acts as the re-insurer and hence guarantees payments as the insurer of last resort. Insurance payments are made in the event of a state announcement of a state of natural catastrophe. Similar solidarity-based models of insurance involving partnerships between the state and insurance industry operate in Belgium and Spain. Netherlands: Flooding is typically excluded from insurance policies in the Netherlands. Under the Calamities Compensation Act (1998), the state is responsible for losses due to floods which are not covered by private insurance. Iceland: The country operates a compulsory insurance regime for natural disasters including floods under a public insurance company, Iceland Catastrophic Insurance. Germany: Major flooding is principally covered by public compensation packages. Private risk-differentiated insurance is available but there is very low take-up of such insurance. USA: Catastrophic flooding is typically excluded from private insurance policies for high-risk areas and is covered by a federal national flood insurance programme. The programme aims to make flood insurance available to those in areas of high flood risk \u2013 \"Special Flood Hazard Areas\". It offers insurance to those within communities that are part of the programme, where insurance is conditional on the communities adopting plans that reduce future flood risks. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 March 2012. The original said that the government will not subsidise households at risk of flooding. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "In today's challenging economic times, social impact measurement is generating a lively and healthy discussion among civil society organisations and donors alike. Charities are feeling the economic strain of lack of funding from traditional sources whilst experiencing an increased demand for their services. Private funders are becoming ever more concerned with social return and achieving maximum impact for their philanthropic contributions; government cuts have led to a growing emphasis on results-based funding which captures the social value of public spending. For charities and social enterprises operating in this environment, evidencing the impact they are having can help set them apart, manage their performance, improve their services and attract funding and public support. The Charity Awards are a great example of an opportunity for winners to compellingly demonstrate their impact and for 2010's winner, CSV, attract not only new funding but also committed volunteers. In order to build long-term sustainability, it is no longer enough for charities to talk about outcomes or the success of their projects individually. The focus on impact today includes the broader and longer term effects of outputs and outcomes and is based on an ability to evidence durable change, perhaps by including the non-direct effects of a project or the consequences on other fields such as government policy, the environment or wider society. Assessing and communicating social impact provides the opportunity to look beyond traditional performance indicators. Charities Aid Foundation's experience of advising donors and charities highlights a growing recognition among both groups of the value of demonstrating social impact. Our advisory work for charities is increasingly focused on supporting organisations to better measure and communicate their impact to donors. Realising a charity's full potential Our experience suggests that charities which transparently measure and demonstrate the changes they are effecting are at an advantage, engaging in relationships with donors long-term and attracting wider public support. If done well, impact measurement can help charities realise their full potential and become better at what they do. Evidence gained from measuring change can not only be used to attract funders but also to influence people, open new relationships, raise profile and even lobbying. CAF's social investment arm, CAF Venturesome undertook its own impact assessment through the Keystone Social Investment Performance Survey in 2010. As well as providing significant value for CAF, the assessment was instrumental in gathering more data on social investment which consequently benefited the market as a whole. Often the most effective way for charities to measure and communicate their impact is through a combination of both quantitative results-driven data and qualitative stories which reflect changes on beneficiaries. However, many face multiple barriers when starting to measure their impact and although most charities are keen to show the difference they make, they often don't know where to start. Challenges range from choosing among competing methods and approaches to measurement, finding the right tools to collect and monitor data, and not having sufficient resources \u2013 money, skills or expertise \u2013 to measure appropriately. Pilot projects in measuring impact It is encouraging to see more efforts addressing the lack of a common standard for impact data like the work of the newly formed Inspiring Impact Group lead by an influential cohort of sector leaders and experts. The group aims to work collectively to support efforts to improve and expand impact measurement for charities considering ideas such as helping charities set aside a small proportion of their funding for the purposes of evaluation and impact reporting. Other pilot projects, such as the Coalition for Efficiency, are testing a formula that will help experienced professionals use their skills to assist charities in putting in their own systems of measurement or improving existing systems. Such programmes reflect the importance that donors are placing on impact demonstration. Equally it highlights their growing willingness to support charities to demonstrate their impact and improve their communications. CAF's advisory work with donors, both corporates and individuals, supports them to take a long term strategic approach to their giving, asking the right question of charities about the results that their work creates and supporting charities to develop themselves as well as their services. The rise in hands on, 'venture' type philanthropists who measure the success of their philanthropy on clearly evidenced results of the change they make through their philanthropic contributions is a positive step towards getting charities and donors to work together around the impact question. Although there is a long way to go in impact measurement and its demonstration, we continue to work with both charities, supporting them to better communicate their transformational work, and with donors to encourage them to play a significant role in demonstrating impact too.

Private funders are becoming ever more concerned with social return and achieving maximum impact for their philanthropic contributions; government cuts have led to a growing emphasis on results-based funding which captures the social value of public spending. </p> <p>For charities and social enterprises operating in this environment, evidencing the impact they are having can help set them apart, manage their performance, improve their services and attract funding and public support. </p> <p>The Charity Awards are a great example of an opportunity for winners to compellingly demonstrate their impact and for 2010's winner, <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/directory/company/1366/community_service_volunteers\" rel=\"nofollow\">CSV</a>, attract not only new funding but also committed volunteers. </p> <p>In order to build long-term sustainability, it is no longer enough for charities to talk about outcomes or the success of their projects individually. The focus on impact today includes the broader and longer term effects of outputs and outcomes and is based on an ability to evidence durable change, perhaps by including the non-direct effects of a project or the consequences on other fields such as government policy, the environment or wider society. Assessing and communicating social impact provides the opportunity to look beyond traditional performance indicators. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/directory/company/283/charities_aid_foundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charities Aid Foundation's</a> experience of advising donors and charities highlights a growing recognition among both groups of the value of demonstrating social impact. Our advisory work for charities is increasingly focused on supporting organisations to better measure and communicate their impact to donors. </p> <h2>Realising a charity's full potential </h2> <p>Our experience suggests that charities which transparently measure and demonstrate the changes they are effecting are at an advantage, engaging in relationships with donors long-term and attracting wider public support. If done well, impact measurement can help charities realise their full potential and become better at what they do. </p> <p>Evidence gained from measuring change can not only be used to attract funders but also to influence people, open new relationships, raise profile and even lobbying. <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/directory/company/283/charities_aid_foundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">CAF's</a> social investment arm, <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/directory/company/283/charities_aid_foundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">CAF</a> Venturesome undertook its own impact assessment through the Keystone Social Investment Performance Survey in 2010. As well as providing significant value for <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/directory/company/283/charities_aid_foundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">CAF</a>, the assessment was instrumental in gathering more data on social investment which consequently benefited the market as a whole. </p> <p>Often the most effective way for charities to measure and communicate their impact is through a combination of both quantitative results-driven data and qualitative stories which reflect changes on beneficiaries. However, many face multiple barriers when starting to measure their impact and although most charities are keen to show the difference they make, they often don't know where to start. </p> <p>Challenges range from choosing among competing methods and approaches to measurement, finding the right tools to collect and monitor data, and not having sufficient resources \u2013 money, skills or expertise \u2013 to measure appropriately.</p> <h2>Pilot projects in measuring impact</h2> <p>It is encouraging to see more efforts addressing the lack of a common standard for impact data like the work of the <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/11351/impact_group_charities_should_allocate_percentage_of_funding_for_impact_measurement\" rel=\"nofollow\">newly formed Inspiring Impact Group</a> lead by an influential cohort of sector leaders and experts. The group aims to work collectively to support efforts to improve and expand impact measurement for charities considering ideas such as helping charities set aside a small proportion of their funding for the purposes of evaluation and impact reporting.</p> <p>Other pilot projects, such as the Coalition for Efficiency, are testing a formula that will help experienced professionals use their skills to assist charities in putting in their own systems of measurement or improving existing systems. Such programmes reflect the importance that donors are placing on impact demonstration. Equally it highlights their growing willingness to support charities to demonstrate their impact and improve their communications. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/directory/company/283/charities_aid_foundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">CAF's</a> advisory work with donors, both corporates and individuals, supports them to take a long term strategic approach to their giving, asking the right question of charities about the results that their work creates and supporting charities to develop themselves as well as their services. The rise in hands on, 'venture' type philanthropists who measure the success of their philanthropy on clearly evidenced results of the change they make through their philanthropic contributions is a positive step towards getting charities and donors to work together around the impact question.</p> <p>Although there is a long way to go in impact measurement and its demonstration, we continue to work with both charities, supporting them to better communicate their transformational work, and with donors to encourage them to play a significant role in demonstrating impact too.</p> <p>To find out more about our advisory work call us 0300 0123 334 or visit <a href=\"http://www.cafonline.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cafonline.org</a></p> <p>Natalie Pinon is senior advisory manager in global philanthropy at the <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/directory/company/283/charities_aid_foundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charities Aid Foundation</a></p> <p><strong><em>Content provided and controlled by CAF.</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "JMW Turner was a strange man who painted some very strange pictures. He was the low-born child prodigy who exhibited his first work at the Royal Academy at the age of 15 \u2013 a man whose talent could have opened society for him but whose obsession with art locked the world out. Unlike such soign\u00e9 contemporaries as Thomas Lawrence, Turner was a man with few friends and a taciturn manner, who beetled about, his stumpy figure swathed in a grubby black dress-coat. He baffled those who knew him with his oddities and his secrecy about everything from his love life to his working methods, and he baffled them with his paintings too. What Turner's contemporaries and succeeding generations admired were his big, finished paintings in the classical tradition and his luminous topographical watercolours. His late, ethereal works, those great swirls of cloud, water and light, were incomprehensible: these pictures \u2013 some of them unfinished \u2013 were seen as aberrations and the product of a genius turned wayward, or even a little mad. They are now, of course, regarded as among his greatest achievements, hailed as the precursor to impressionism and cited as evidence of his merit as a pure painter, forever pushing at the boundaries of art. It has been a rapid volte face. The art grandee Kenneth Clark recalled seeing rolls of these canvases stacked in the cellars of the National Gallery in the 1940s, where they were thought to be old tarpaulins, and glimpsing a watercolour sheet patching a broken window. It was really only from the 1960s, with the influence of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and the Abstract Expressionists in mind, that these works came to be appreciated for their painterly values rather than as subject pictures gone wrong. It is a mark of Turner's importance that different ages can celebrate such contrasting aspects of his work, and this spring there are two exhibitions that give a chance to compare the viewpoints, ancient and modern: Turner Inspired: In the Light of Claude at the National Gallery and Turner and the Elements at the Turner Contemporary, Margate. His output was simply too vast for there ever to be a comprehensive overview of his career \u2013 he painted more than 500 oils and his bequest to the nation alone comprises some 30,000 watercolours and sketches \u2013 but these shows highlight two ever-present themes in his art. In the middle of Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, the novel's lovers, Frederic Henry and Catherine Barkley, are in the middle of a bout of billing and cooing when Frederic declares: \"Oh, darling, I want you so much I want to be you too.\" It is a sentiment that, without the amorousness but with the besottedness, Turner would have recognised with regard to Claude. Such were the emotions the great 17th-century landscapist stirred in Turner's heart that, according to a witness, on first seeing his Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba: \"Turner was awkward, agitated and burst into tears.\" Throughout his career Turner would turn to Claude, sometimes in the spirit of emulation, at others in competition and pastiche. Sometimes, too, for financial reasons: since Claudes were so collectable there would be a premium if he painted similar pictures. For Turner it was less a relationship than a correspondence. There were many reasons for Turner's self-identification, not least similarities of circumstance and disposition. While Claude started life as a pastry cook, Turner was the son of a Covent Garden barber and a butcher's daughter. Claude was an orphan at 12, while Turner's mother went mad. As artists, both men struggled with the human figure and both were driven by the desire to give landscape painting the same power to move and elevate as history paintings. Even though Claude came from the Duchy of Lorraine and painted the Roman countryside, he was a very British artist. By 1820 more than half his 300 paintings were in British collections, brought home as prized souvenirs by Grand Touring milordi. His pictures could be seen in three dimensions, too, in the landscape gardens of William Kent and Capability Brown. He brought out the purple poet in the Londoner Turner, who relished his paintings' \"amber-coloured ether, the mid-day ethereal vault and fleecy skies, resplendent valleys, campagnas rich with all the cheerful blush of fertilisation, trees possessing every hue and tone of summer's evident heat, rich, harmonious, true and clear\". Claude's pictures also suggested to him a new way of painting his native land. By adopting his predecessor's themes \u2013 pastoral views, river scenes framed by trees, seaports \u2013 and a judicious use of close observation, Turner could fuse the continental landscape tradition with the British countryside. From 1791 Turner took annual sketching tours that revealed the unexpected beauties of regions from the West Country to Wales, the Lake District, Scotland and Yorkshire. The sketches he made of the river Tamar and the Thames at Richmond, of Plymouth docks and Linlithgow Palace, he turned into idylls, matching the particularity of place with Claudean idealising. A clump of framing foreground trees, a loop of water in the middle distance, a cluster of buildings or a group of locals, a pale horizon, all knitted with sun-infused colour, and at a stroke he raised the scenes from the merely topographical to the universal. He admired Claude's ability to \"select, combine and concentrate that which is beautiful in nature and admirable in art\", and this is what he set out to do himself. Turner was painting Claudean pictures before he ever visited Italy. Crossing the Brook, which caused a stir at the Summer Exhibition of 1815, showed a transubstantiated slice of Devon, while Dido Building Carthage of the same year was pure homage, a direct tribute to Claude's Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba (1648). It wasn't until 1802 and a brief respite in the Napoleonic wars that Turner first travelled abroad, and not until 1819 that he finally made it to Italy. He was initially disappointed, having to wait until Ancona before he could recognise \"the first bit of Claude\" in the landscape. The big paintings that resulted from this trip and from a second visit in 1828 showed both a heightened colour and an increasingly poetic mood. Rome from the Vatican and Modern Rome, Campo Vaccino (which in 2010 became the most expensive Turner sold at auction when it fetched $45 million) were Claudean in both composition and theme, but still not to everyone's taste. The Italians who saw such works in situ were contemptuous, and an early biographer reported that while Turner was in Rome \"an English tradesman was living there, who made a great to do, and sold English mustard; and when his namesake [Turner] came and exposed his wares, the Romans, who are a peculiar class of jokers, proclaimed that one sold mustard, and the other painted it\". One critic declared simply of the Roman pictures: \"Cacatum non est pictum\" \u2013 they were crapped not painted. Turner never lost his Frederic Henryish urge, and Claude continued to pop up in his art wherever he found himself \u2013 Venice, Le Havre or even Cowes. Look carefully at the bottom of Rain, Steam and Speed (1844), his defining image of the railway age, and there is a group of ghostly Claudean bathers at the river's edge beneath the locomotive. Nor was Turner content to be known as \"the English Claude\" just in his own lifetime; he wanted the identification for posterity too. The terms of his bequest to the nation stipulated that two of his paintings, Dido Building Carthage and Sun Rising Through Vapour, should hang alongside Claude's Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca and Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba. The two artists have been yoked together in the National Gallery ever since. If Claude represented the elegiac and calm side to Turner's art, his treatment of the elements represented its frequent turbulence. Throughout his career he was always a painter of the insubstantial: pick any decade of his maturity and you see land treated as if it were air and air as if it were water. He was never a painter of line but always one of mass, tone and light, and the four elements were interchangeable. As Turner aged he believed more and more that \"every look at nature is a refinement upon art\", and so with every look he had to keep up. This perhaps lay behind his technical experimentation and near manic image-making. He filled sheet after sheet with subtly graded bands of watercolour, the rudiments of shore, sea and sky; where traditional practice demanded that oil paintings be built up from dark to light, he painted on light grounds to achieve a greater sense of translucence; he experimented with different-shaped canvases to capture the vortex that was characteristic of his way of seeing nature oblivious to the presence of man. He envisioned things in natural phenomena that others didn't: he could sketch a storm on the back of an envelope while standing in the doorway of Farnley Hall in Yorkshire and turn it into the maelstrom of Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps (1812) and distil a dozen British sunsets into the apocalyptic Angel Standing in the Sun (1846). When the Houses of Parliament caught fire in 1834, Turner hired a boat from which to sketch the scene like some 19th-century Magnum photographer, but the rapid watercolours he dashed down show an almost pyromaniacal delight in the chaos of the conflagration. It was for him the ultimate moment of transformation \u2013 solid matter burnt to atoms, discharged into the air and reflected in the waters of the Thames. The essayist William Hazlitt dismissed Turner's experiments with atmospheric effects as \"pictures of nothing, and very like\". They may indeed be paintings of the immaterial, but they are also evidence of Turner's search for the numinous. They are the proof of his adherence to a religion of his own, expressed for the first and last time on his deathbed: \"The Sun is God.\"",

Delving back into etymology and fiction \u2013 and a consideration of how these linguistic roots have branched into a modern weed of unfairness \u2013 can help us better understand the social consequences of the words we choose. Let's start with etymology. Hysterical. It's a word with a very female-baiting history, coming from the Latin hystericus (\"of the womb\"). This was a condition thought to be exclusive to women \u2013 sending them uncontrollably and neurotically insane owing to a dysfunction of the uterus (the removal of which is still called a hysterectomy). Here's another: loony. Coming from lunacy \u2013 a monthly periodic insanity, believed to be triggered by the moon's cycle (remind you of anything?). These etymologies have cemented a polarisation of the female and male mental states: men being historically associated with rationality, straightforwardness and logic; women with unpredictable emotions, outbursts and madness. Think about how that plays out today. Let's invent a character. This person is quirky, outspoken and highly intelligent \u2013 sometimes to the bewilderment of those around them. If he's a man, he's a \"bearded eccentric intellectual\", \"misunderstood\" or a \"tortured genius\". But what if our invented character is a woman? My guess is that she would be described as \"shrill\", \"unhinged\", \"depressed\", \"bonkers\" and almost certainly \"hysterical\". We seem to describe hyper-intelligent women and men using different value judgments. Time for some evidence to back this up. The right created their own lexicon for \"loony lefty\" Harriet Harman. Perhaps, I'd suggest, because she was a woman who was succeeding in undoing their patriarchal privilege. Politics aside, the language spoke for itself: she was belittlingly labelled \"mad Hattie\" in Boris Johnson's Daily Telegraph column. Rather than discuss, she \"raves\". Instead of proposing policies, she embarked on a \"crazy crusade\" (Dominic Lawson, the Times), or \"a mad equality bill\" (Simon Heffer, the Telegraph). Now fast-forward to the current cabinet \u2013 I had to delve back to the last government for a pro-feminist minister as there are such slim pickings in the current one \u2013 when David Cameron infamously told Angela Eagle, one of the shadow cabinet's brightest minds, to \"calm down, dear\". Tellingly, if you've ever interviewed or spoken to Eagle, as I have several times, you'll know that she's the most logical and rational thinker you could meet. There are consequences to these words. Women aren't trusted with serious positions as much as men are; it's well documented that they're disproportionately represented everywhere from boardrooms to the corridors of power (just one in five MPs are women). They're not trusted to write factually about the world around us as much as men are; as Kira Cochrane's investigation illustrated: 78% of newspaper articles are written by men. Clearly, language is not solely responsible. But it certainly forms part of the unholy jigsaw of factors that led to this unbalanced society. The consequences can go even further. In both fiction and the real world, creative, talented, fascinatingly intelligent women have been led down a path of torment, self-doubt, self-harm and even self-destruction \u2013 cast off as unhinged when they had so much unique brilliance to offer a world that refused them the space to express it adequately; a world that equates female genius too closely with insanity: from the madwoman in the attic in Jane Eyre and Shakespeare's Ophelia to Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Dorothy Parker - maybe even Amy Winehouse. There were a group of women who tried something revolutionary: a new vernacular, one that rejected the rigid, hyper-rational, masculinised parlance used by utilitarian men of law and medicine. They were the French feminists, and Ecriture f\u00e9minine embraced the endless capacity for innovation in language. It was radical, outside-the-box thinking involving \"writing the body\", bringing a non-linear, playful poetry to the language that shapes our perceptions. Its ambitious goal was to reposition the centre of sanity to something more pluralistic through diction. Unfortunately, it was about as successful (and perhaps utopian) as Esperanto was in becoming the universal second language. Today is International Women's Day. How many women around the world are we undervaluing because our language stigmatises and stifles them? This gendered linguistic problem means we're still dismissing women as hysterical lunatics \u2013 evidenced by their unrepresentative numbers in politics, business, art and journalism.

      "bodyText": "The commanding officer of the six men killed when their armoured vehicle was hit by a massive explosion in Afghanistan has paid tribute to the soldiers and insisted the regiment remains committed to its mission. Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning said the six men, five of whom were aged between 19 and 21, were \"incredibly brave\" and would expect their comrades to continue to do their duty. Speaking outside Battlesbury barracks in Warminster, Wiltshire, Stenning said: \"Barely 48 hours ago, we heard the terrible news that six soldiers from The 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment were declared missing, believed killed, after their Warrior armoured vehicle was caught in an explosion in southern Afghanistan. \"As the commanding officer of a tight-knit family regiment, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my incredibly brave men, and to offer my deepest condolences to their families, and to their many friends.\" He said a few words about each of the men. Stenning described the youngest, Private Christopher Kershaw, 19, as a \"true Yorkshire warrior \u2026 a star of the future.\" The oldest, Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, was \"quite simply the best\". Stenning added: \"Six of our brothers have fallen. It has been a sad day but as their brothers in arms we remain committed in our duty to continue with our mission. They would want nothing less. Our loss is very great today but this of course is nothing compared with the deep loss felt by their families and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are firmly with them today.\" Two of the six came from Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. The town's MP, Barry Sheerman, called for a fresh Commons debate on operations in Afghanistan. He said he did not believe Britain should \"cut and run\" from the mission but said this week's events should bring the war back on to parliament's agenda. The deaths take the toll of British personnel killed in Afghanistan to 404 and represent the biggest loss of UK life in a single incident in Afghanistan since 2006, when an ageing RAF Nimrod crashed shortly after midair refuelling, with the loss of all 14 people aboard. Passing the symbolic milestone of 400 deaths has refocused attention on the reason for the presence of British troops in Afghanistan, the timetable for their removal and the capability of the Afghan army and police force to keep the country secure once coalition troops have left. Defence officials said the deaths would have no effect on strategy or tactics deployed by British troops. If anything, it would encourage military commanders to stay the course, they said. However, officials indicated ministers were well aware of war-weariness among the public. An investigation is under way to find out what caused the explosion that wrecked the Warrior vehicle as it patrolled the border of Helmand and Kandahar in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday. The force of the blast led to early speculation that the vehicle was hit by an old mine, possibly from the Soviet era, but an initial examination of the Warrior suggested it was probably a large Taliban roadside bomb. The extraction of the bodies was hampered by bad weather, defence officials said. David Cameron described the loss of the men as a \"desperately sad day for our country\". He said it was a \"reminder of the huge price that we are paying for the work we are doing in Afghanistan and the sacrifice that our troops have made and continue to make\". But the prime minister pointed out that the men were carrying out important work to prevent Afghanistan becoming a haven for al-Qaida to plan attacks on the UK or its allies. Downing Street said last month that British troops would end their lead combat role in Afghanistan by the end of next year. This will lead to Afghan security forces being in sole charge of combat operations against insurgents by the end of 2014, when most of Britain's 9,500-strong contingent will have returned home. The timeframe may well be shortened at the Nato summit in Chicago in May. However, Nato commanders in Afghanistan have told Downing Street and the White House that they want to keep levels of the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) as high as possible between now and the end of the \"fighting season\" next year \u2013 September 2013. They insist this is the best way of ensuring the country does not descend into chaos before the final withdrawal of combat troops. If Cameron agrees to Nato's proposal, about 9,000 UK troops will remain in Helmand until autumn next year. They would be under more pressure too: 16,000 US marines are withdrawing from Helmand within months, and although Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, has said Britain will not \"backfill\", Afghan forces are unlikely to be able to shoulder the burden of security alone. Privately, commanders also warn that the Isaf coalition could disintegrate if either country signals an early exit. \"That is the biggest danger for Afghanistan,\" said one. \"A hasty and chaotic exit must be avoided.\" But political pressure is mounting on both sides of the Atlantic to accelerate the drawdown. The loss of the British soldiers this week is bound to raise questions about their resources. Cameron accepted there was a need to make sure personnel had all the equipment they needed to keep them \"as safe as possible\". But the MoD was quick to quash suggestions that the vulnerability of the Warrior could be blamed for the deaths. The Warrior vehicle has been upgraded throughout its service in Iraq and Afghanistan to try to combat the threat from roadside bombs and mines. A \u00a31bn upgrade was announced at the end of last year to extend its life to 2040 and beyond but the MoD stressed this was not in response to \"any identified deficiencies\" in its armour. A spokesman said: \"Warrior provides some of the highest levels of protection available but sadly no armoured vehicle can provide absolute protection from the very largest explosions.\" Writing in the Times the chief of the defence staff, General Sir David Richards, said the progress made since entering the country in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks was \"truly impressive\" and vowed to continue the strategy and tactics employed by British troops. \"As progress continues the work of our servicemen and women will draw down but our efforts will endure,\" he said. \"Sadly as we hold that course it is likely that others will lose loved ones.\" Richards added that he and his troops did not underestimate the dangers faced in Afghanistan, but understood \"the importance of the mission with which we are charged\". \"We will hold our nerve,\" he added. The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, claimed morale in Afghanistan remained \"extremely high\" because soldiers knew they had an important job to do. He said: \"The people on the ground are acutely conscious of the risks that they are running but they are also incredibly proud of the job that they are doing and rightly so, and hugely satisfied by the level of public support that they have back home.\" The former foreign secretary David Miliband warned that there was no \"political strategy\" in Afghanistan to secure the peace after British military operations came to an end. \"The absolute key is that at the moment we have extraordinary bravery, as well as sacrifice, intelligence and skill, from British service people and that is tactically making advances, but what is missing is a clear strategy,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"That is absolutely key to the last two years of British combat operations. By strategy I mean a plan to make sure there is a sustainable peace in Afghanistan after our time there in military operations.\" He added: \"We know that, in the end, there needs to be a political solution in Afghanistan \u2013 all the tribes in, all the neighbours onside and al-Qaida kept out. It's the absence of that political strategy that is brought into stark relief by the terrible news yesterday.\"",

      "bodyText": "Good housing is critical to good public health and with the creation of Public Health England, local authorities have important new responsibilities to improve public health and tackle health inequality. As people live longer, the likelihood of disability, illness and poor health also increases \u2013 and with 23% of older people living below the poverty line, housing associations are invaluable partners in promoting health and reducing health inequalities. Where people live is one of the key determinants of health and good housing is in itself a public health investment. Settled housing improves health and reduces the incidence of respiratory and other diseases that are common among older people. Housing is widely associated as a social determinant of health, but housing associations offer so much more than bricks and mortar. For example, they provide a range of services in the community to improve health and prevent ill-health. They directly contribute to the two overarching outcomes in the recently published Public Health Outcomes Framework: to increase healthy life expectancy and to reduce differences in healthy life expectancy through greater improvements in disadvantaged communities. Several indicators in the framework are particularly relevant to organisations providing housing and care to older people such as those relating to falls, injuries, dementia and excess winter deaths. There are approximately 70,000 hip fractures annually and half of those with hip fractures never regain their former level of function, while one in five dies within three months. Falls and resultant fractures in people aged 65 and over account for over 4m bed days a year in England alone and associated costs are estimated at more than \u00a32bn a year.

Settled housing improves health and reduces the incidence of respiratory and other diseases that are common among older people.</p> <p>Housing is widely associated as a social determinant of health, but housing associations offer so much more than bricks and mortar. For example, they provide a range of services in the community to improve health and prevent ill-health. They directly contribute to the two overarching outcomes in the recently published Public Health Outcomes Framework: to increase healthy life expectancy and to reduce differences in healthy life expectancy through greater improvements in disadvantaged communities.</p> <p>Several indicators in the framework are particularly relevant to organisations providing housing and care to older people such as those relating to falls, injuries, dementia and excess winter deaths. There are approximately 70,000 hip fractures annually and half of those with hip fractures never regain their former level of function, while one in five dies within three months. Falls and resultant fractures in people aged 65 and over account for over 4m bed days a year in England alone and associated costs are estimated at more than \u00a32bn a year.</p> <p>Housing associations such as Futures Homescape are reducing the human and financial impact of such injuries.

      "bodyText": "A lot has happened since the last time we checked in on The Avengers. For a start, the film seems to have undergone a name change in the UK, where it will be saddled with the unwieldy moniker Avengers Assemble in apparent deference to a certain camp 1960s Brit spy duo. We've also seen a couple of new trailers drop over the past fortnight, and earlier this week a movie storybook which may or may not give away vital plot details leaked online. If you'd rather go into this thing completely fresh \u2013 and who could blame you? \u2013 my advice would be to LOOK AWAY NOW. There be spoilers in this here post, and some of them ain't pretty. By way of compensation, we do have Scarlett Johansson speaking German. First of all, to the storybook. These things are notoriously poor indicators of final storylines, not least because they are often produced by people who couldn't be further out of the creative loop while script changes are still under way. But feel free to check out Worst Previews' scan if you're feeling reckless. Keen watchers of the Marvel movie universe will already be aware that Thor's nefarious brother Loki is the villain of the piece in Joss Whedon's film. But if the evidence here is to be believed, it looks like he might be getting (at least temporary) backup from Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, previously a heroic figure on the side of superhero agency S.H.I.E.L.D. Furthermore, there are strong suggestions that Thor's own loyalties may be in conflict, at least in the film's opening reel. We're also led to believe that Loki has gained extra powers after arriving on Earth: apparently, humans have no choice but to do the villainous norse deity's bidding. Might this be the source of the army which he's rumoured to acquire at some point during the movie? This post at marvelousnews.com suggests (by \u2026 ahem \u2026 checking out the film's forthcoming Lego tie-in) that the villain's foot soldiers are probably not Frost Giants or Skrulls, the green extraterrestrials from the comics, so the jury's still out on how Loki plans to assemble enough firepower to defeat the combined forces of Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America and Black Widow. This first trailer is the final English-language effort before the film drops on 26 April in the UK and 4 May Stateside. This one eschews previous promos' focus on Robert Downey Jr's wisecracking antics as Iron Man in favour of a straight-up action approach. For an explanation of why he's fighting Thor at one point, see the storybook. The second trailer arrived this week and is heavily dubbed. If the sight of Johansson spandexed up as Black Widow is already enough to put you in a tizzy, be warned: the effect is quadrupled in German. Here, the emphasis is back on the comic banter between our heroes. Worst Previews has kindly provided a translation of a couple of key moments: Extended Tony Stark scene Tony: And following orders is obvious not my style. Cap: And everyone knows that style is all you care about. Tony: Of all the people around here, who wears the most figure-hugging outfit? End scene with Tony Stark Tony: I promise a stress-free environment. No surprises. Banner: Ow! Cap: Hey! Tony: You really got it under control, don't you. What's your secret? Relaxing jazz, bongo drums? Cap: Is everything like a joke to you? Tony: If it's funny! The Hulk still seems to me to be Avengers Assemble's white elephant, having been the star of two extremely middling movies of his own. Whedon gave SFX an insight into how the not-so-jolly green giant will play out in the new film with newcomer Mark Ruffalo in the role. \"[We needed] a Bruce Banner who's not obsessed with his own problems,\" he told the magazine. \"A Hulk who not only feels flesh and blood, but is clearly an extension of Banner himself and not just a CGI thing that roars. A Hulk who feels dangerous, who might actually hurt someone we care about, who belongs in a classic horror film. And much more. He's the hardest character by far, and ended up being the most fun.\" Whedon added: \"Mark is such a delightful mensch it's stupid. His Banner is a bunch of contradictions: graceful and awkward, meek and confident, erudite and working class, funny and sad. And contradictions are what the Banner/Hulk dynamic are all about. Also, Mark kinda looks like the Hulk. So we got to build our Hulk from him.\" Up until now, Marvel studios' task \u2013 the one that began with Iron Man in 2008 and has now spanned five films \u2013 has been relatively easy. Introducing superheroes within their own distinct universes is a piece of cake in comparison to creating a cinematic world in which they can all hang out together. Whatever you think of the occasionally clunky furniture parachuted into past movies to remind us that we're all waiting for Avengers Assemble, Whedon's film arrives at a point where we at least know enough about these characters on the big screen to be able to sit back and enjoy an ensemble adventure with no need for further exposition. That in itself is something of an achievement, wouldn't you agree?",

      "bodyText": "Steve Bridger - social media expert, builder of bridges Social media is essential for engagement: Charities are very good at using social media tactically around campaigns. But there's a difference between digital marketing and communications, and digital engagement. That gap is bridged by participation and more people need to receive the signals that they can build relationships online in the light-touch way. Predicting donor behaviour is incredibly difficult: For example, I've been a supporter of the National Trust for years. Sometimes I let my membership lapse but it doesn't mean I feel any less passionate about what they do. This isn't recognised and I have never been approached to support them in other ways. People tune in and tune out but don't (necessarily) turn off for good. Engagement is nuanced which constitutent relationship management (CRM) databases struggle to account for. Tobin Aldrich - director of fundraising, WWF-UK Re-engaging donors: Individuals don't consider themselves to be 'lapsed' donors so we shouldn't either. We need to know about everyone who might be warm to supporting us and that includes people who have given in the past. Find ways to re-engage them in your cause \u2013 what they have responded to in the past gives is a good indicator. Don't forget follow-on communications: Charities often spend all their time thinking about recruiting supporters and creating really powerful communications to do this. They then forget to continue this in follow-on communications once a supporter has joined. You have to keep engaging with supporters in ways they respond to. As fundraisers our job is to connect the supporter with the cause in the way that works best for them. We shouldn't tell them everything about our cause and certainly not all at once. Over time we should give them a variety of ways to engage and watch their response/listen to their feedback at each stage. When constructing marketing campaigns we often need to make assumptions about what will be engaging. But we always need to check these assumptions with actual behaviours to make sure we are getting the balance right. It's like all other forms of direct marketing \u2013 test and learn. Alissa Barlow - development director, Child's i Foundation Social media makes the experience real for donors: Showing our supporters the difference their money is making in real-time is central to what we do. We use social media because it helps us break down the barriers between the supporter and the children, and helps connect the individuals that make our work possible. Recently we made a film answering a concern a supporter had. It was great and we're planning to do more of this to encourage that essential two-way dialogue. Be as honest and open as you can: One of the biggest mistakes charities make is trying to spin a good news story about a difficult situation. Honest communication goes a very long way. It comes back to the very basics of relationship building \u2013 you don't have much without trust. People forgive mistakes, they understand changes, but if you lie to them or keep them in the dark they'll be off like a shot. If they're well-informed and feel you're respecting them enough to have a difficult conversation, they're much more likely to stay with you. Nikki Mason - head of corporate partnerships, The Scout Association Donations aren't just financial: Expertise and time given through volunteering etc can all be valuable assets that link the donor to the charity. We all need more help \u2013 what about asking donors if there are other things they can give over and above cash? At The Scout Association, volunteers are as important as financial donations and ultimately this leads to income generation anyway. Consider the level of the donation: The communication will vary depending on the potential of the donor partnership. With a greater level of investment, the relationship and communication becomes much more personal and therefore promoting other areas of the charity's business is much easier. This also improves the understanding of which areas of the charity's business a donor is likely to support, which makes it easier to introduce new opportunities. Danielle Atkinson - head of digital and individual giving, Merlin The recession: We haven't seen the full effect of the recession yet. Don't panic about this - most donors give because of how they feel about your organisation, not because they can afford to. We need to maintain perspective and not let the recession become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Don't be afraid to spoil donors with a retention piece of direct marketing: This could pay for itself. We do an annual thanks mailing at Merlin. It is personalised to the donor and is a pure retention piece \u2013 it has no ask whatsoever attached to it. You need to make these things look as genuine as possible. Every direct marketing programme should have at least one 'pure' retention piece in its communication stream. Thanking is incredibly important, and although it does cost money, it's worth it. Martin Campbell - UK managing director, Convio Take a look at Chatter: Chatter is Salesforce's version of Facebook. It ties together the social media interactions that happen across an organisation in a meaningful way. By combining the campaigns you have set up in your CRM with the chatter groups (customer groups) you can very quickly set up some really fluid conversations with supporters about particular campaigns, giving them direct access to the right people and ensuring that supporter's voices are heard within the organisation. It works just as well in larger organisations where the need for ad-hoc informal discussions is just as great. Join up the information you collect and build up a picture about donors: Look at all the information you have before deciding how to treat donors. If it's hard, get expert help. For example, consider the bank account of a gym \u2013 it's possible to tell the difference between someone who's paying \u00a350 per month and just about to leave and someone who's paying \u00a350 per month and will be a member for 10 years. You just need to look at the right information. You don't need to look at how often they pay their monthly direct debit, you need to look at how often they go to the gym. It's only by opening up communications and using the information gathered intelligently that charities can get the information they need. With so many donors setting up direct debits online, it's absolutely within reach of most charities to use online tools to find out what they need. Determine how donors want to be contacted: While major donors can have the benefit of individual personal attention, the vast majority of donors don't give enough for this to be economical. Think through in advance how to determine the preferences of donors \u2013 what areas they are interested in, their preferred style of giving, how and how often do they want to be communicated with. Rather than having a few groups of donors to be treated the same, make all interactions, campaigns, and engagements able to respond to and build upon this information. Of course this is easier online than offline (where the majority of interactions will occur) but good CRM and online tools make this entirely possible. Alison McCants - direct marketing manager, The Brooke One mistake is in the bait-and-switch: Donors sign up to one thing and then get communications that relate to something else. A good communication tool, be it a paper-based newsletter or a regular e-update, works wonders in terms of building donors' understanding of what a charity does and what needs support. But it's not just about charities educating the donors so they're willing to listen to what we want to talk about \u2013 really listening to donor, instead of just talking about ourselves is essential. It's a two-way process. Sam Jeffers - strategy director, bluestatedigital (BSD) Don't separate campaigning and fundraising: Both are key parts of telling the story of an organisation and it's a really effective strategy to intertwine the two as closely as possible. Too many organisations have a wall, running separate communications calendars, separate data stores and separate departments to co-ordinate activity. Put yourself in a supporter's shoes - do they see the difference from the outside? Probably not. Thank people for contributions quickly and often: It's fairly common for people to make a single gift and receive a thank you email, but uncommon to get a series of relevant communications that explain the impact, lay out next steps and tell supporters relevant facts at appropriate moments. A great example of a basis for relevant communications is something Oxfam does. If you Gift Aid your donation at their shops, they email you a month or two later showing how much your items sold for. It's a nice piece of stewardship, showing a really strong link between offline and online, local and international development. The ability to send people relevant communications, either to solicit further donations or to involve them more deeply in the wider cause, is incredibly powerful. Don't categorise donors: Organisations can put people into segments that don't make a whole lot of sense. You end up stuck in a binary member/non-member up-sell type of communications, rather than starting to work on a useful relationship at a lower level. It's always worth creating gradations of support that lead towards the most useful thing someone can do for you. For example, signup &gt; email sign up &gt; campaign signatory &gt; single donor &gt; regular giver &gt; volunteer &gt; advocate. Work out how to use your communications to take people along that journey, always remembering that if they fall off, you can find a lower level of activity that's satisfactory for both sides. Valerie Morton - standards committee member, Institute of Fundraising (IoF) Communicate change: Involve donors in your journey. If you were considering a major change at home you would keep your friends up-to-date and ask their advice. We cannot talk to all our donors over a glass of wine on a Saturday night, but we can show them how much they are part of the family by letting them know what's happening and giving them an opportunity to contribute to the process.

But there's a difference between digital marketing and communications, and digital engagement. That gap is bridged by participation and more people need to receive the signals that they can build relationships online in the light-touch way.</p> <p><strong>Predicting donor behaviour is incredibly difficult:</strong> For example, I've been a supporter of the National Trust for years. Sometimes I let my membership lapse but it doesn't mean I feel any less passionate about what they do. This isn't recognised and I have never been approached to support them in other ways. People tune in and tune out but don't (necessarily) turn off for good. Engagement is nuanced which constitutent relationship management (CRM) databases struggle to account for.</p> <h2>Tobin Aldrich - director of fundraising, <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">WWF-UK</a></h2> <p><strong>Re-engaging donors:</strong> Individuals don't consider themselves to be 'lapsed' donors so we shouldn't either. We need to know about everyone who might be warm to supporting us and that includes people who have given in the past. Find ways to re-engage them in your cause \u2013 what they have responded to in the past gives is a good indicator.</p> <p><strong>Don't forget follow-on communications:</strong> Charities often spend all their time thinking about recruiting supporters and creating really powerful communications to do this. They then forget to continue this in follow-on communications once a supporter has joined. You have to keep engaging with supporters in ways they respond to. As fundraisers our job is to connect the supporter with the cause in the way that works best for them. We shouldn't tell them everything about our cause and certainly not all at once. Over time we should give them a variety of ways to engage and watch their response/listen to their feedback at each stage.

      "bodyText": "Hamas officials have said that in the event of a war between Iran and Israel, they will not become involved on Tehran's side. While this is not surprising, other officials within the movement were quick to deny such reports. Historically, Hamas has always gone to great lengths to assert its independence from any foreign influence. It is widely recognised that it receives support from powers such as Syria (until recently) and Iran. Yet this has never been worn as a badge of honour by the movement. Rather, its leadership has consistently asserted that the movement cannot be influenced or directed by any external power. It has insisted that it charts its course based on the will of the people \u2013 in stark contrast to Fatah and its leadership, who have frequently been portrayed as the pawns of western powers and Israel. Hamas, which governs Gaza, is also territorialised, limiting its resistance to historic Palestine. Unlike the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and perhaps because of lessons learned from it, Hamas has rarely if ever meddled in regional or global affairs, either rhetorically or through acts of resistance. Even its sporadic bouts of tension with Jordan were more due to the regime's discomfort at having an active Islamic party in its backyard and less about Hamas carrying out resistance activities from the kingdom. Being territorialised also meant that Hamas limited its war to a well-defined battle: that of liberating Palestine from \"Zionist occupation\". Siding with Iran in the much-hyped potential conflict with Israel would act against all these long-standing principles. It would flagrantly present the movement as an entity which is being influenced by an external player. More importantly however, it would demonstrate that the movement is fighting a tangential battle rather than what it sees as its historic one. On the other hand, it could be argued that Hamas's cause is aligned with that of Iran, especially since it has long acted as the movement's benefactor. But using this to justify extending Hamas's support to Iran would be one step removed from Hamas's raison d'etre. Hamas firing rockets into Israel would really not be fighting the Palestinian battle any more; it would be fighting Iran's battle on a Palestinian playground. Rather than asking why Hamas would decide not to actively side with Iran, though, a more interesting question is why Hamas would feel the need to say so now. If anything, this move comes on the heels of several recent manoeuvrings aimed at better aligning Hamas with regional changes. The recent tour of the region by Ismail Haniyeh climaxed with explicit support for the people of Syria against a brutal regime. Also, Khaled Meshaal recently declared his intention to form a Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood, suggesting a desire to capitalise on the democratic rise of \"moderate\" Islamic parties in regional politics. Significant differences clearly exist among Hamas's leadership but they do not conceal its collective recent push to secure a formalised political role in the Palestinian establishment. The differences appear to be mostly about the means to achieve this goal. Siding with Iran in what would be a high-profile and explosive conflict would ruin such efforts. Hamas would immediately incur the ire of the international community and risk being isolated once more \u2013 all to salvage a relationship with Iran that has already been severely weakened. If anything, Hamas has already clarified its choices when its leadership moved out of Syria, much to the chagrin of both Syria and Iran. Rather than positioning itself as Iran's proxy, parts of the movement are trying to pre-emptively distance Hamas from the Islamic Republic and sticking to its principle of fighting solely for Palestinian liberation. At a time when people at the grassroots are calling the shots across the region, Hamas is prudently differentiating itself from other regimes and parties by visibly siding with the people. This is not a new concept for Hamas, since it has always derived its legitimacy and popularity from Palestinians. Hamas feels \u2013 probably rightly \u2013 that it can capitalise on the changes sweeping the region. This will almost certainly be more rewarding than defending Iran for a potential, but improbable, return to financial support. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "Amnesty International has written to every member of the House of Lords urging them to oppose government plans that it says will prevent victims of human rights abuses overseas suing UK multinational companies. So far this week the government has been defeated six times in the Lords over amendments to the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders bill, which aims to save \u00a3350m a year from the Ministry of Justice budget. Further votes are due next week on reform of the \"no win, no fee\" system that the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, has attacked for fuelling a \"compensation culture\". Amnesty warns that the bill will require both the lawyer's success fee and the after the event insurance premium to be paid for out of the compensation awarded to victims. \"Taken together, these costs are likely to wipe out potential damages awarded and will make the claim financially unviable at the outset,\" Amnesty says. \"Under the proposed reforms, it is unlikely that victims such as the 69,000 people living in Bodo, Nigeria, would have been able to pursue a case against the multinational conglomerate Shell, who recently admitted full culpability for two massive oil spills in the region.\" Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, said: \"It is outrageous that a government which professes to want to promote 'responsible capitalism' is giving carte blanche to powerful goliath companies to abuse human rights with no remedy for their victims. \"The proposed reforms will not even come with a saving to the public purse. The only beneficiaries will be the multinational corporations defending the case whose costs will be reduced at the expense of the victims' damages. This should not be allowed to happen.\" The government is trying to turn the battle over the bill into a party political dispute, with David Cameron taunting the Labour leadership that it is opposed to any financial cuts and as financially irresponsible as Greek parliamentarians. Campaigners opposing the bill point out that many of the amendments in the Lords have been put down by Conservative peers such as Lord Newton, a former social security minister under Margaret Thatcher, Liberal Democrat and crossbench peers. Even the Taxpayers' Alliance has expressed concern about the proposals. On Wednesday night, the Lords voted by 237 to 198 to preserve legal aid for appeals against welfare benefit decisions, defeating reforms in the government's bill. The amendment had been tabled by the Liberal Democrat Lady Doocey with support from Labour, Conservative and cross-bench peers. A second amendment, tabled by Lord Newton, ensured that legal aid should be available for higher-tier benefit appeals. It was passed by 222 votes to 194. On funding medical reports for clinical negligence cases, the government was beaten by 178 to 172 votes. An attempt to retain legal aid for all medical negligence cases, however, did not succeed. The votes came at the end of a two-hour debate during which every speaker in the upper chamber \u2013 apart from the minister \u2013 opposed the Ministry of Justice plans. Peers from all parties questioned whether the proposed savings would be made. Earlier Lord McNally, the Liberal Democrat justice minister, warned that if the government lost on the issue of providing legal aid on welfare benefit issues and support for advice centres, it would \"tear out the heart of the rationale of the bill\". The defeats will add to the pressure on the government's parliamentary timetable. On Monday, the government was defeated on three other legal aid amendments. The coalition is expected to try to reverse the Lords' decisions in the House of Commons on the grounds that the bill is primarily a financial measure. Commenting on the vote to retain legal aid for welfare benefit appeals, the shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, said: \"This victory provides a vital safety net for the poorest in our society. It ensures that when bureaucrats make a mistake which denies support, like disability benefits, to the vulnerable and their families, then they will have expert advice in making an appeal. \"According to Citizens Advice, every \u00a31 of taxpayer money spent on legal aid in benefit cases saves the state up to \u00a38.80 down the line. So, regardless of the government's spin, today's vote is also about saving the taxpayer money through early-stage intervention, of the kind that prevents problems escalating, reducing the call on resources, in future months and years.\" Richard Hawkes, chief executive of the disability charity Scope, said: \"Thousands of disabled people and their families will be delighted at the action taken by peers in the House of Lords today. \"The Lords have recognised that to cut legal aid at a time of unprecedented changes to welfare support would have meant disabled people who fall foul of poor decision-making, red tape or administrative error would have been pushed even further into poverty as they struggled to manoeuvre the complicated legal system without the necessary expert support they need. \"The result would have been a ticking time-bomb of poorly prepared and lengthy tribunals and appeals, choking the courts and not saving money as suggested by Ken Clarke, but actually costing the government far more in the long term.\"",

It appears organically grown in farmers' markets, and even in high street shops the provenance is often British. Even if the home-grown plants don't quite as sleek as their commercial relatives, they are still a great asset to have in the garden. They are perfect to wilt, because the firm stalk has a good bite beside the soft leaves. In this way, they are similar to chard and often I have used young chard leaves in their place in this recipe. The joy of this broth is that it is both simple to prepare yet incredibly comforting to eat. I often keep the necessary chicken stock, lime leaves and lemon grass in the freezer, ready for a last minute supper. The mushrooms, water chestnuts and bamboo are delicious and make it more substantial, but are can easily be omitted. The Tom Yum paste is also an optional addition but does take the aromatic flavour to an even deeper level. You could of course make your own. If pak choi doesn't mind the cold, nor should we. But this might at least keep us warm until spring arrives.

Add a spoonful of tom yum paste if using. Continue to simmer for a few more minutes then strain to remove the flavourings. Return the aromatic broth to the saucepan and bring back to a simmer. Taste and add the fish sauce and lime juice. The flavour should be slightly sweet and fragrant, salty from the fish sauce and hot from the chilli and sour from the lime. Strip the leaves from the pak choi and tear any larger ones in half. Add the mushrooms, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots to the broth and cook for a minute or so. Then add the dumplings or noodles, and a couple of minutes before they are ready, add the pak choi. Serve the steaming broth with the dumplings and pak choi and chopped coriander on top.",

That is for each organisation to work through itself led by its board and executives. Primary issue: On average around two thirds of tenants have their rents supported by housing benefit. So taxpayer interest in VFM is legitimate. But the issue isn't primarily about saving money, it is about future investment in new homes and a range of related services. Bigger picture: Housing associations together turn over around \u00a312bn per year. A 1% efficiency saving yields a useful sum but not enought to build many homes. The open market value of social housing is around \u00a3250bn. Unlocking 1% of this value would build a great many homes. That is why the draft VFM standard suggests that providers should understand the return on their assets and develop a strategy for maximising the future return as measured against their own social objectives Vipul Thacker is head of performance at Genesis Housing Association Impact assessment: For all decisions taken (be it building new homes or putting in capital investment), the impact on users must be assessed and then tracked to ensure that costs associated are agreed with regard to the outcomes sought. Know your tenants: The key will be in getting tenants to actively engage in a process leading to making a judgment on value for money for their services. And to that, we need to know what they really want, think and need to know. Will Perry is director of business development at HouseMark You shouldn't have to wait for regulation: It's about doing the right things, doing them right, and keeping on doing them right as the context changes. VFM is shorthand for running an effective business that balances the various needs of its stakeholders in meeting its objectives. If it's a regulation driven add-on it just becomes another burden. Participation: When we started developing the HouseMark dashboard its working name was 'VFM scorecard' which made a lot of people switch off \u2013 VFM as something done to you, rather than something you participate in. When participation is enabled, the outcomes will be better. Context is crucial: This is why transparency is a potentially lethal concept. What can provide the context is good comparison with appropriate peers \u2013 a combination of understanding your own cost drivers and the performance of others. Linda Cherry is business development director at consultancy Solutions for Housing Have a plan: What I have found is that people do not know where to start. They tend to start with writing a strategy and with little idea of where they are now, where they are going and what they will see when they get there. This generally leads to a vague policy document instead of an actual strategy for improving VFM. Culture change: You need to have VFM driven down from the board. If it isn't embedded within the culture, then it isn't going to be seen as part of the day job and instead will be an add on when people have time. Andy Crowe is director of Solent Housing Partnership Peer reviews: I found that every housing service that undertook a peer review gained one more star when it came to be inspected. Peer reviews can be a low cost means of sharing expertise. Tenants: Tenant scrutiny has to be at the heart of value for money reviews, but it is unfair to expect them to have the knowledge and skills without experience and training. Perception: Most people fear redundancy at the moment and so VFM can often be seen as a threat. Yet it can be a key to saving jobs, by securing efficiencies that can be reinvested in other services. Metrics: Good, accurate information is critical to value for money. I recently carried out a value for money review and found that outcomes were not being monitored by the client or the contractors. How could anyone possibly make a judgement on quality on that basis? Greg Bones is director of resources at Peaks &amp; Plains Housing Trust Oversights: You can try to measure everything and still miss something important. It is important that staff and customers tell the managers what the company does that could be done better or what is not valued by them. Somebody already knows what the key performance indicator you haven't invented yet will tell you \u2013 they're telling their friends down the pub. Culture: Out of the housing associations I looked at, those that had a culture of listening to customers and staff actually had costs 15% lower than those who were focused more on cutting costs through procurement and structures. Neil Thorneycroft is a chartered certified accountant and an independent financial consultant Review: It is vital that organisations constantly review their services with the customer at the core of the review. I can guarantee that if an organisation hasn't reviewed a service for many years they will find efficiencies when they do. Cost is not the only criteria: Staff effort and time also needs considering but it is often overlooked. When reviewing services it is important that everything is taken into account. Staff can often be stretched to the limit chasing that extra \u00a31 saving, but other costs can negate the saving in staff sicktime because of stress, or the extra cost incurred because the quality of the service they provide has gone down. Failure: It is a failure to focus on outcomes which metamorphosises VFM into making cuts \u2013 which are not one and the same thing.

If it isn't embedded within the culture, then it isn't going to be seen as part of the day job and instead will be an add on when people have time.</p> <h2>Andy Crowe is director of <a href=\"http://solenthousing.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Solent Housing Partnership</a></h2> <p><strong>Peer reviews: </strong>I found that every housing service that undertook a peer review gained one more star when it came to be inspected. Peer reviews can be a low cost means of sharing expertise.</p> <p><strong>Tenants:</strong> Tenant scrutiny has to be at the heart of value for money reviews, but it is unfair to expect them to have the knowledge and skills without experience and training.</p> <p><strong>Perception:</strong> Most people fear redundancy at the moment and so VFM can often be seen as a threat. Yet it can be a key to saving jobs, by securing efficiencies that can be reinvested in other services.</p> <p><strong>Metrics: </strong>Good, accurate information is critical to value for money. I recently carried out a value for money review and found that outcomes were not being monitored by the client or the contractors. How could anyone possibly make a judgement on quality on that basis?</p> <h2>Greg Bones is director of resources at <a href=\"http://www.peaksplains.org/\" title=\"\">Peaks &amp; Plains Housing Trust</a></h2> <p><strong>Oversights: </strong>You can try to measure everything and still miss something important. It is important that staff and customers tell the managers what the company does that could be done better or what is not valued by them. Somebody already knows what the key performance indicator you haven't invented yet will tell you \u2013 they're telling their friends down the pub.</p> <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Out of the housing associations I looked at, those that had a culture of listening to customers and staff actually had costs 15% lower than those who were focused more on cutting costs through procurement and structures.</p> <h2>Neil Thorneycroft is a chartered certified accountant and an <a href=\"http://neilthorneycroft.co.uk/\" title=\"\">independent financial consultant</a></h2> <p><strong>Review: </strong>It is vital that organisations constantly review their services with the customer at the core of the review. I can guarantee that if an organisation hasn't reviewed a service for many years they will find efficiencies when they do.</p> <p><strong>Cost is not the only criteria:</strong> Staff effort and time also needs considering but it is often overlooked. When reviewing services it is important that everything is taken into account. Staff can often be stretched to the limit chasing that extra \u00a31 saving, but other costs can negate the saving in staff sicktime because of stress, or the extra cost incurred because the quality of the service they provide has gone down.</p> <p><strong>Failure: </strong>It is a failure to focus on outcomes which metamorphosises VFM into making cuts \u2013 which are not one and the same thing.</p> <p><em>You can read the full discussion </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/mar/02/live-discussion-value-money-housing\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network </strong></a><strong>for housing news, best practice and comment direct to your inbox</strong></p>",

He was, in fact, a distraction to prevent you from seeing another impeccably dressed gentleman outside, removing the local newspaper bill from its metal rack. \"We realised we had to steal them,\" said Gilbert. \"We had a drawer full of chewing gum at one stage,\" said George. The men responsible for the systematic theft of 3,712 newspaper bills in east and north London are, of course, the artists Gilbert &amp; George \u2013 and on Thursday they revealed the results in an exhibition across all three White Cube galleries in London. The 292 bills that made it into London Pictures form Gilbert &amp; George's largest series of works. The artists have grouped the bills together by subject \u2013 yobs, for example, with LASER YOBS ENDANGERED COPTER PILOT and RABBIT IS SET ALIGHT BY YOBS \u2013 and laid them out in groups on a background which features them as ghostly observers. They assumed that getting the bills would be easy. \"We thought it would be very simple, we'd ask the shopkeeper to keep last week's poster,\" said George. \"But it was: 'What do you want that for guv?'. 'What's your game?' and 'Where are you from anyway?' They were very suspicious and very aggressive \u2013 they would never let you have one.\" \"Not one,\" interjects Gilbert. They were caught in the act only once when an \"overenthusiastic\" policeman came up to George as he was putting a bill in his pocket. He pretended to be a teacher making a display of the posters at his school to try to curb antisocial behaviour and relieve pressure on police. \"He replied: 'Oh sir, if only more people were like you.'\u2009\" The project has taken up all their time. \"We've lived it, we've breathed it, we've sexed it, we've thought it \u2026 everything,\" said George. \"More than any other pictures, they went all the way through us.\" He said appropriating the bills allowed them to tackle subjects they otherwise may not have tackled: \"I wouldn't like to start thinking about how you draw or paint a group of yobs \u2013 it would seem very patronising or awkward.\" Gilbert &amp; George have been hoarding the bills at their studios in Fournier Street, east London, where they have lived and worked for 40 years. They are something of an institution and there are people who will hang around the street in the hope of spotting the two on their regular walks. They have won the Turner prize (1986), represented Britain at the Venice Biennale (2005) and had a retrospective at Tate Modern (2007). Throughout, they have never been shy of offending sensibilities: the Naked Shit Pictures from the mid-1990s, for example, which featured the artists naked alongside giant turds. Four years ago, they entered into a civil partnership which they said was primarily to do with protecting the other's interest if one of them were to die. Most of the bills in the new show are from Gilbert &amp; George's normal hunting ground around Spitalfields and Liverpool Street, in east London, but some betray a wider journey \u2013 N7 GAS TERROR AS COPPER THIEVES STRIKE, for example, which features the postcode for Holloway. \"We went to north London for dinner,\" said George. The bills are a reflection of a society that we are all complicit in, the artists said. \"It is quite extraordinary that you have this slogan, this poster every single day and everybody just moves on. The next day it's another one. This is life standing still,\" said Gilbert. The works are full of \"death plunges\", \"terror\" and \"murder\" but they also have a positive side. \"Yes there's a lot of misery, shame and unhappiness but this is also a celebration in a way because there are many countries where you can't have posters like this. It's a sign of an amazing freedom,\" said George. The pictures will be on display at the White Cubes in Bermondsey, Hoxton and Mason's Yard, in central London, until 12 May \u2013 it costs nothing to get in and see them, but anything between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3250,000 to buy one.",

      "bodyText": "Tributes to the six men killed in Afghanistan were led by Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning, commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment. Corporal Jake Joseph Hartley, 20 Hartley, known as JJ, was fit and motivated, yet always under-stated, Stenning said. \"JJ was a top soldier. His rise through the ranks had been swift but rightly so. He was a natural leader. He was a selfless dedicated leader of men and no doubt a future regimental sergeant major.\" Hartley attended Earlsheaton technology college in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, before enlisting aged 17 in 2008. He completed a 20-week training course at the Army Training Regiment in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire. Private Anthony Frampton, 20 Frampton, from Huddersfield, won a best recruit award after completing his combat infantryman's course at the infantry training centre in Catterick, North Yorkshire. His platoon commander, Lieutenant Dan Ellis, said at the time: \"Private Frampton has been awarded the Soldier's Medal. This award is given to the best team player on the course and is voted for by the other recruits. \"Private Frampton has been excellent at raising the spirits of the platoon and has been invaluable in helping his fellow recruits \u2013 he is the soldiers' soldier.\" Frampton said after receiving the award: \"I've made loads of mates and I'm much more confident now.\" Melanie Williams, head of Royds Hall high school in Huddersfield, said: \"Anthony left Royds Hall in 2007 and is fondly remembered by staff as a memorable young man with a strong character and a real sense of humour. Friendly and polite, he was also caring and compassionate towards other students. \"Anthony will always be remembered by the school community with pride and we extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends.\" The Leeds Rhinos rugby league player Danny Bravo tweeted: \"RIP the Huddersfield soldiers specially my class mate Anthony bring our lads home.\" Stenning described Frampton as a \"fit and carefree soldier and the life and soul of his platoon\". He said he was a thoroughly likable young man. \"Framps could motivate and encourage the whole battalion with his cheekiness and smile. Behind his cheeky nature lay a truly dedicated soldier who was committed and brave, a true legend amongst his peers.\" Private Daniel Wilford, 21. Wilford was just 16 when he signed on with the Yorkshire regiment at the army recruiting office in Huddersfield in 2007. Friends said he briefly left the army and worked in a supermarket, but rejoined the military. Stenning said: \"He was the archetypal Yorkshire infantry soldier: quiet, unassuming but with bags of character. Wilf was happy-go-lucky and confident and his smile would light up any room. Honest and dedicated, his friends and colleagues trusted and respected him.\" Private Daniel Wade, 20 Flowers have been left on the wooden front gate of Wade's family home near Warrington, Cheshire. Stenning said he had only recently joined the battalion. \"In only a small time he had made a real mark. It is to his credit he successfully completed his Warrior driving course so early in his career. In his spare time Dan loved speed on wheels. He had a real passion for motocross and super-bikes.\" Private Christopher Kershaw, 19 The youngest of the men was described by Stenning as \"one of my fittest soldiers\". He added: \"Chris's natural love of the great outdoors shone through in everything he did. It was this passion coupled with his drive to continually develop himself that made him stand out. A true Yorkshire warrior, Chris was marked out as a star of the future.\" Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33 Coupe, from Fylde in Lancashire, was the most senior of the men killed and the only one from a different regiment \u2013 the 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.

His rise through the ranks had been swift but rightly so. He was a natural leader. He was a selfless dedicated leader of men and no doubt a future regimental sergeant major.\"</p> <p>Hartley attended Earlsheaton technology college in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, before enlisting aged 17 in 2008. He completed a 20-week training course at the Army Training Regiment in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire.</p> <h2>Private Anthony Frampton, 20</h2> <p>Frampton, from Huddersfield, won a best recruit award after completing his combat infantryman's course at the infantry training centre in Catterick, North Yorkshire.</p> <p>His platoon commander, Lieutenant Dan Ellis, said at the time: \"Private Frampton has been awarded the Soldier's Medal. This award is given to the best team player on the course and is voted for by the other recruits.</p> <p>\"Private Frampton has been excellent at raising the spirits of the platoon and has been invaluable in helping his fellow recruits \u2013 he is the soldiers' soldier.\"</p> <p>Frampton said after receiving the award: \"I've made loads of mates and I'm much more confident now.\"</p> <p>Melanie Williams, head of Royds Hall high school in Huddersfield, said: \"Anthony left Royds Hall in 2007 and is fondly remembered by staff as a memorable young man with a strong character and a real sense of humour. Friendly and polite, he was also caring and compassionate towards other students.</p> <p>\"Anthony will always be remembered by the school community with pride and we extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends.\"</p> <p>The Leeds Rhinos rugby league player <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/danny_bravz\" title=\"\">Danny Bravo tweeted</a>: \"RIP the Huddersfield soldiers specially my class mate Anthony bring our lads home.\"</p> <p>Stenning described Frampton as a \"fit and carefree soldier and the life and soul of his platoon\". He said he was a thoroughly likable young man. \"Framps could motivate and encourage the whole battalion with his cheekiness and smile. Behind his cheeky nature lay a truly dedicated soldier who was committed and brave, a true legend amongst his peers.\"</p> <h2>Private Daniel Wilford, 21.<br></h2> <p>Wilford was just 16 when he signed on with the Yorkshire regiment at the army recruiting office in Huddersfield in 2007. Friends said he briefly left the army and worked in a supermarket, but rejoined the military.</p> <p>Stenning said: \"He was the archetypal Yorkshire infantry soldier: quiet, unassuming but with bags of character. Wilf was happy-go-lucky and confident and his smile would light up any room. Honest and dedicated, his friends and colleagues trusted and respected him.\"</p> <h2>Private Daniel Wade, 20 </h2> <p>Flowers have been left on the wooden front gate of Wade's family home near Warrington, Cheshire. Stenning said he had only recently joined the battalion. \"In only a small time he had made a real mark. It is to his credit he successfully completed his Warrior driving course so early in his career. In his spare time Dan loved speed on wheels. He had a real passion for motocross and super-bikes.\"</p> <h2>Private Christopher Kershaw, 19<br></h2> <p>The youngest of the men was described by Stenning as \"one of my fittest soldiers\". He added: \"Chris's natural love of the great outdoors shone through in everything he did. It was this passion coupled with his drive to continually develop himself that made him stand out. A true Yorkshire warrior, Chris was marked out as a star of the future.\"</p> <h2>Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33 <br></h2> <p>Coupe, from Fylde in Lancashire, was the most senior of the men killed and the only one from a different regiment \u2013 the 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment. Sergeants typically are second in command to a troop or platoon of up to 35 soldiers.</p> <p>Coupe joined the regiment from the armoured training centre in Bovington in Dorset where he excelled as an instructor. Stenning said: \"He was proud to be a Lancashire soldier in a Yorkshire battalion. His technical prowess was unmatched. He was quite simply the best. We have lost one of our brothers who led and mentored those above and below him with true humility.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Republicans delivered this week another crack in their party's stained-glass ceiling, muscling Mormon Mitt Romney one step closer to securing his party's elusive nod. Gone, it seems, are the days of a protestant Republican presidential nominee. But while the three leading contenders for the GOP nod have all found themselves outside the religious mainline, all the analysts agree, somehow: Romney has a Mormon problem. And though he's been buffeted for years now with the expectation that evangelicals and independents alike could not be reconciled to voting en masse for a Mormon, the theological contours of his bid grew sharper still this week \u2013 with a furor over an obscure Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints rite, whereby deceased persons are posthumously baptized. Recently discovered genealogical records indicate that Mormon proxy baptisms were performed on Anne Frank and Simon Wiesenthal. Even Mahatma Gandhi and England's Princess Diana allegedly received the treatment. You'll find no argument from this former aide to Jon Huntsman, himself a prominent Mormon: it's a curious practice. Even weird, as allies of the president's re-election campaign will whisper this fall. But is the ambiguity of Mormon otherness \u2013 the incalculable theological idiosyncrasies and insular nature of this distinctly American upstart \u2013 enough to sour the election prospects of the faith's most prominent member? Not by half. According to an analysis of exit polling by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, Romney won outright the evangelical vote in two primaries and was only narrowly edged in three more. He even leads Catholic Rick Santorum among voters of the same faith. In the evangelical-rich South, the implications of Romney's faith could prove even less significant, if the enthusiasm differential \u2013 in which Mormons are wildly outpacing their born-again brethren \u2013 persists. Exit polling from the recent Nevada contest revealed one in four voters were Mormons, though the faith group only accounts for 5.6% of the state's total population. Of Mormon voters, Romney won nine of ten. In marque match-up Ohio, two in four voters were evangelical Christians. Only, this \"broad church\" is not the voting monolith CLDS members have proven, awarding Romney 30% of the vote, to Santorum's 46. Despite the entreaties that he deliver another religion address, one more robust and personal than his 2007 offering, Romney has largely managed to assuage evangelical concerns by merely emphasizing the shared ethics of faith, family and freedom. But it's not Romney's nuanced faith pitch that deserves the credit for boosting his share of the evangelical vote from four years earlier, rather the yeoman's work of his fellow Mormons. Not since Romney's father, George, staged his own bid for the presidency in 1968 has the Utah-based faith come so close to vaulting one of its own to the White House. Forty-four years wiser \u2013 a period of serious maturation for a faith whose roots are traced only to 1830 \u2013 the dexterity with which the Mormon Church and its members have shouldered the candidate's faith burden is nothing less than an in-kind political contribution of the greatest sort. Now ubiquitous in a number of American and international markets, the \"I'm a Mormon\" advertising campaign has offered a new face of the faith, distinct from the bicycling, buttoned-shirt phenotype: young, diverse and hip. Not entirely unlike you, just hipper. Individual Mormons, too, are taking nothing for granted, quietly organizing for election day routs throughout the country. They're also establishing the type of financial infrastructure Romney would need to unseat a deep-pocketed Obama. (Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney super political action committee, raised $3.4m from a mere handful of wealthy Utahns.) Should Romney earn his party's nomination, Mormons will find their greatest challenge lies not in softening the temperaments of Southern evangelicals, but combating the brewing offensive of the incumbent. Campaign aides to the president began last year stoking latent concerns over Romney with the promise to spotlight his \"weirdness factor\". For a party itching to reclaim the executive, Republicans could ask for no better election season gift than the transparent intonation of dark perversity in Romney's alleged weirdness, no more fortunate foil. America will not find Romney's faith \u2013 shared by 6 million other Americans and defined by a threefold mission to preach, purify and provide for the needy \u2013 weird or eerily distinct from from the mainstream religious landscape. Weird, instead, will be the prospect of Obama, whose own former pastor nearly sunk his own presidential bid four years earlier, making church affiliation an issue. Romney's political liabilities are legion: he championed healthcare reforms to which the deeply unpopular federal reforms may be traced and has espoused competing convictions on the full conservative issue matrix. But for all the bandwidth exhausted on questions of his Mormonism, reminiscent of those that punctuated the 1960 presidential election in which another out-religion candidate sought the White House, Romney's faith is simply not liability any longer.",

      "bodyText": "Architectural firm Wilkinson Eyre's tilting Gateshead Millennium Bridge has been a popular feature of the Tyne since it was hauled up river by the world's largest floating crane, and installed next to the entrance to the Baltic over 10 years ago. No figures have been kept, but it is estimated that over 4 million people have crossed the bridge \u2013 either on foot or bicycle \u2013 in the decade since people started to use it to get from Newcastle to the Baltic and its neighbour the Sage Music Centre. Sadly, the view of the elegant parabolic double curve of the bridge has been partially marred since it was first installed by a series of 16 unsightly grey bollards rising out of the river bed. These huge steel structures are now even uglier than at first, having been heavily rusted from a decade of tidal water rising and falling up them. Fortunately, having been found to be unnecessary, they are finally being removed, causing widespread delight on Tyneside. The bollards, officially called a 'Vehicle Collision Protection System', are generally referred to locally as 'the Harbourmaster's Piles', after the harbourmaster of the Port of Tyne Authority, which insisted on a safety system to ensure that river traffic did not collide with the bridge. Back in the late 1990s, the river traffic going upstream to Dunston Staithes and a now defunct fuel oil depot next to the Swing Bridge was much heavier than it is now. A recent survey has concluded that, thanks to the smaller number of ships using the upper reaches of the Tyne, the risk of a collision with the Millennium Bridge is now so slight that it will be safe to remove the bollards, replacing them with warning lights. Work extracting them is now being carried out by a floating crane called the Forth Atlas. The cylindrical steel piles weigh 30 tons each and are 25 metres long \u2013 with 10 metres going through silt, and the final 5 metres in the river's bedrock. Taking them out is apparently less expensive than the cost of retaining and maintaining them. The final one should be removed next Tuesday, well ahead of the schedule of the end of March. The steel will be recycled. Gateshead Council cabinet member with responsibility for transport John McElroy will be pleased to see the back of them, saying: This will be a popular move. The bollards did not feature in the original designs for the bridge but were added during the construction phase. Their removal will mean that the bridge will appear, for the very first time, the way its designer originally intended. Mike Nicholson, the current harbourmaster is pleased they're going too, commenting: We are delighted that we've been able to work with Gateshead Council to reach a solution and replace the bridge protection system. Some local wits have described the operation as \"the most expensive haemorrhoidectomy in history\", and many people feel that it was probably pointless to have installed them in the first place. It would be hard to find anybody who regrets their departure. Amongst its many awards and accolades, the \u00a317.7m Gateshead Millennium Bridge won the 2002 RIBA Sterling Prize, the 2004 Baltasar Neumann Prize, and awards from the Royal Fine Art Commission Trust, the Royal Academy, the Institute of Structural Engineers and the American Institute of Architects.",

But there is nothing illegal about this eavesdropping \u2013 listeners are being invited to share those \"rare conversations that really matter\" to build a \"unique picture of our lives today and preserve it for future generations\". A joint initiative with the British Library and BBC local radio, The Listening Project will be fronted by Fi Glover and was inspired by a similar project in the US, Storycorps. Radio 4 controller Gwyneth Williams said: \"We want to bring a new kind of conversation onto Radio 4, made possible by the unique nature of radio, its intimacy and entanglement in the lives of audiences. \"I'd like to invite listeners to help us catch, broadcast and archive for the nation those rare exchanges that really matter; those conversations that can change the course of a life; that are utterly memorable; that we have all had and never forget.\" Listeners will be able to submit their conversation through the Listening Project website which will launch on 19 March. Glover said: \"The Listening Project has an element of magic to it. \"Radio provides the perfect place for the intimacy of a profound conversation between two people \u2013 but the joy of this prospect is that it then allows all of us to eavesdrop on that conversation, and I defy anyone not to learn more about our shared human experience through doing so. \"The Listening Project is awesome in the scale of its ambition but humbling in the intimacy of each conversation \u2013 I am thrilled to be a part of it.\" Selected conversations will be broadcast in edited three-minute versions on Radio 4 before various news bulletins on Fridays, beginning on 30 March, with a 15-minute omnibus edition on Sundays. The Listening Project will gather pace with five 15-minute specials which will air Monday to Friday, beginning on 25 June. What people speak about will be left up to them, according to the BBC. It could be a moment of \"joy, sadness, or reflection \u2026 creating the space for people to have that conversation they always meant to have\".

He wanted two years and is believed to be discussing a move, possibly to Stade Fran\u00e7ais. Tindall's time at Kingsholm appeared under threat when he returned from the World Cup and the shenanigans in a South Island bar to be warned by Bryan Redpath, Gloucester's head coach, that he was playing for his contract. Redpath said then: \"If Mike plays well there is no reason not to keep him on for another year, but if he doesn't, then we sit down and have a discussion and I say: 'Mate it's not right for Gloucester rugby.'\" That time appears to have passed. Tindall lost his place in the England elite squad after the World Cup troubles and without that money next season he was looking at a pay cut Gloucester were reluctant to make up. Redpath has a history of refusing to meet the demands of senior players and, even though Gloucester were in the black last year, he now has younger players, with England potential rather than an England past, on which to spend his money. The Samoan centre Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu is also understood to be leaving the club, but Redpath has plenty of centre options: Billy Twelvetrees is moving from Leicester to the join the England Saxons Henry Trinder and Jonny May, plus Tim Molenaar and Ryan Mills. Tindall was asked last Sunday, after the defeat at Leicester, about a potential move to Paris and replied with a smile on his face: \"I'm still a Gloucester player.\" If Gloucester fail to make the play-offs \u2013 they are currently six points adrift of fourth-placed Northampton \u2013 that is likely to be the case for only five more games. He and his wife, Zara, the Queen's granddaughter, are believed to have invested in an equine centre in Spain. Tindall's current contract was only for one year, but he agreed that on the grounds that he would be of limited use to Gloucester in a World Cup year. However, since returning, after the last of his 75 caps, he has put in some solid performances notably in Toulouse in the Heineken Cup and more recently at his former club Bath. It is performances such as those that convinced Tindall he was worth another two years. Negotiations are understood to have been protracted, but in the end Redpath stood firm and Tindall last weekend conceded: \"I would like to stay at Gloucester but it's difficult, it's down to the club.\" In the past two weeks Gloucester have lost the internationals Luke Narraway and Alasdair Strokosch to Perpignan while England's new No8, Ben Morgan, has been signed from the Scarlets.",

Credit Suisse analysts put out a note on Wednesday that singled it out as a possible bid target: 1) We believe the group is a unique European internet play, positioned to benefit from structural tailwinds in media: increasing digital sports media consumption, broadband penetration, online video advertising, in-play betting and new digital platforms and devices. 2) In our view, Perform has a scalable business model and technological platform that should facilitate growth. 3) Perform has attractive financials, with strong revenue and profit growth with high revenue visibility and cash flow conversion. 4) We believe several of Perform's businesses offer significant 'blue sky' upside potential not reflected in our forecasts or valuation. 5) Ultimately, we believe that Perform's rights portfolio, digital positioning and resultant top-line growth will likely attract potential acquisition interest. The analysts raised their price target on the stock from 280p to 320p. But any rise in the shares may be short lived. Takeover hopes drove the stock up to around 283.5p on Wednesday, but they sunk back later to close at 272p. Rather more substantial bid rumours are flying around Bowleven, the West Africa-focused small-cap oil explorer, after it shot up 15% to 98p. Westhouse Securities analyst Andrew Matharu said: It's in play now. It's been in play for a while. Traders say blue-chip peer Tullow Oil is the interested party and that it could offer 180p a share. The shares are still a way off the high of 134.25p in late February, when Dragon Oil expressed an interest in the business, only to walk away 10 days later. Jefferies analysts said: While nothing came of the short flirtation Dragon Oil had with Bowleven, we believe it highlights the industry sees underpriced opportunity in Bowleven's shares.

      "bodyText": "Well, that's a turnup for the books: Google's Chrome browser has been the first to be hacked at the annual Pwn2own competition. Having seen its product being untouchable for the past two years, the company may have become a little overconfident - and offered up to $60,000 to anyone who could hack it at all, up to a limit of $1m. It was a challenge which a French team, Vupen, was very happy to take - and break. In fact, they hacked Chrome during the first five minutes of the competition, and (under the new rules) took 32 points. It also earns them $20,000 from Chrome for using bugs in Chrome itself to gain \"full unsandboxed code execution\". Note: A representative for Pwn2own tells us that \"Vupen did not compete in the Pwnium competition and therefore will not receive any money from Google. Also: Google has updated Chrome to fix the hole exploited by the hack. (Thanks @rquick for the link.) The hack was carried out on the Windows version: according to Justin Schuh, of Google's Chrome team, the exploit \"didn't break out of the sandbox\u2026 it avoided the sandbox\". Update: Pwn2own says that the sandbox-avoiding exploit \"is true for the competitor in Pwnium. Vupen's was a full sandbox escape for Pwn2own.\" The Twitter feed for the contest (which began at 12 noon Pacific time on Wednesday) indicates that Safari was the next to fall - again by Vupen. Vupen has attracted some controversy by discovering and then selling vulnerabilities and exploits to government customers - a business that one might think is both lucrative and risky. Chaouki Bekrar, the co-founder and head of research, told ZDNet that \"We had to use two vulnerabilities. The first one was to bypass DEP and ASLR on Windows and a second one to break out of the Chrome sandbox.\" In fact the Vupen team had achieved this last May, though too late of course for the March-timed Pwn2own. At the time they said that The user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted web page hosting the exploit which will execute various payloads to ultimately download the Calculator from a remote location and launch it outside the sandbox (at Medium integrity level). No trickery is needed at the contest, of course, because the teams can direct the browsers to whatever pages they've set up to exploit vulnerabilities. Vupen said that they have come armed with vulnerabilities which will exploit each of the browsers on show - Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. But they decided to go after Chrome first, Bekrar told ZDNet: \"We wanted to show that Chrome was not unbreakable. Last year, we saw a lot of headlines that no one could hack Chrome. We wanted to make sure it was the first to fall this year.\" Equally he was complimentary about Chrome, generally seen as possibly the most secure browser because of its hefty sandboxing. \"The Chrome sandbox is the most secure sandbox out there,\" Bekrar told ZDNet. \"It's not an easy task to create a full exploit to bypass all the protections in the sandbox. I can say that Chrome is one of the most secure browsers available.\" An interesting point for Vupen is that all of the hacks used at Pwn2own are meant then to be disclosed publicly - which implies that they have either sold them already to customers (who will have been told to make use of them by this date, or may be feeling a little narked), or that they're just polishing their reputation by hacking everything in sight. With day one over, Vupen looks to be far ahead of the rest. Update: Pwn2own tells us that \"Everything Vupen displays at Pwn2own was created especially for this competition. The exploits were not previously sold to customers.\" There's a page with the progress of the Pwn2own competition. Vupen is miles ahead of everyone at present with 124 points. The competition ends on Friday 9 March. The competition, which has been running for a number of years, has usually seen Apple's Safari being the first to fall (usually at the hands of fabled ex-NSA hacker Charlie Miller), with Firefox and Internet Explorer surviving longer. The advent of Chrome in the past few years has changed the landscape: its sandboxing and general security model has made it proof against repeated attacks. (The browsers run on the latest, fully-patched versions of Windows or Mac OSX; this year, it's Windows 7 and Lion.)",

In fact, they hacked Chrome during the first five minutes of the <a href=\"http://pwn2own.zerodayinitiative.com/\">competition</a>, and (under the <a href=\"http://pwn2own.zerodayinitiative.com/rules.html\">new rules</a>) took 32 points. <strike> It also earns them $20,000 from Chrome for using bugs in Chrome itself to gain \"full unsandboxed code execution\". </strike> <strong>Note:</strong> A representative for Pwn2own tells us that \"Vupen did not compete in the Pwnium competition and therefore will not receive any money from Google.</p> <p>Also: Google has <a href=\"http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/03/chrome-stable-channel-update.html\">updated Chrome to fix the hole</a> exploited by the hack. (Thanks @rquick for the link.)</p> <p>The hack was carried out on the Windows version: according to Justin Schuh, of Google's Chrome team, the exploit \"didn't break out of the sandbox\u2026 it avoided the sandbox\". <strong>Update:</strong> Pwn2own says that the sandbox-avoiding exploit \"is true for the competitor in Pwnium. Vupen's was a full sandbox escape for Pwn2own.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/Pwn2Own_Contest\">Twitter feed for the contest</a> (which began at 12 noon Pacific time on Wednesday) indicates that Safari was the next to fall - again by Vupen.</p> <p>Vupen has attracted some controversy by discovering and then selling vulnerabilities and exploits to government customers - a business that one might think is both lucrative and risky. Chaouki Bekrar, the co-founder and head of research, <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/pwn2own-2012-google-chrome-browser-sandbox-first-to-fall/10588\">told ZDNet</a> that \"We had to use two vulnerabilities. The first one was to bypass DEP and ASLR on Windows and a second one to break out of the Chrome sandbox.\"</p> <p>In fact <a href=\"http://www.vupen.com/demos/VUPEN_Pwning_Chrome.php\">the Vupen team had achieved this last May</a>, though too late of course for the March-timed Pwn2own. At the time they said that </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted web page hosting the exploit which will execute various payloads to ultimately download the Calculator from a remote location and launch it outside the sandbox (at Medium integrity level).</p> </blockquote> <p>No trickery is needed at the contest, of course, because the teams can direct the browsers to whatever pages they've set up to exploit vulnerabilities. Vupen said that they have come armed with vulnerabilities which will exploit each of the browsers on show - Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. But they decided to go after Chrome first, Bekrar told ZDNet: \"We wanted to show that Chrome was not unbreakable. Last year, we saw a lot of headlines that no one could hack Chrome. We wanted to make sure it was the first to fall this year.\"</p> <p>Equally he was complimentary about Chrome, generally seen as possibly the most secure browser because of its hefty sandboxing. \"The Chrome sandbox is the most secure sandbox out there,\" Bekrar told ZDNet. \"It's not an easy task to create a full exploit to bypass all the protections in the sandbox. I can say that Chrome is one of the most secure browsers available.\"</p> <p>An interesting point for Vupen is that all of the hacks used at Pwn2own are meant then to be disclosed publicly - which implies that they have either sold them already to customers (who will have been told to make use of them by this date, or may be feeling a little narked), or that they're just polishing their reputation by hacking everything in sight. With day one over, Vupen looks to be far ahead of the rest. <strong>Update:</strong> Pwn2own tells us that \"Everything Vupen displays at Pwn2own was created especially for this competition. The exploits were not previously sold to customers.\"</p> <p>There's a <a href=\"http://pwn2own.zerodayinitiative.com/status.html\">page with the progress of the Pwn2own competition</a>. Vupen is miles ahead of everyone at present with 124 points. The competition ends on Friday 9 March.</p> <p>The competition, which has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/mar/21/pwn2own-wrap-up\">running for a number of years</a>, has usually seen Apple's Safari being the first to fall (usually at the hands of fabled ex-NSA hacker Charlie Miller), with Firefox and Internet Explorer surviving longer. The advent of Chrome in the past few years has changed the landscape: its sandboxing and general security model has made it proof against repeated attacks. (The browsers run on the latest, fully-patched versions of Windows or Mac OSX; this year, it's Windows 7 and Lion.)</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former Times legal manager, Alastair Brett, has submitted written evidence to the Leveson inquiry about his actions when the paper went to the high court in a legal bid to unmask the anonymous police blogger NightJack. Brett told MediaGuardian he had submitted a witness statement after being served a section 21 notice by Lord Justice Leveson to give evidence, following accusations that he kept the Times editor in the dark over the legal action. He added that he still waited to hear if he would be called to give evidence in person. Last month the inquiry heard that the Times had failed to tell Mr Justice Eady, the high court judge sitting in the case, that a reporter had illegally hacked the email of police blogger NightJack, Richard Horton, during a court action to get a gagging order overturned in 2009. The Times won the case, but its editor, James Harding, told Leveson he knew nothing about the legal action until it had begun. \"I have been served with a formal request and a series of questions have been put to me in relation to NightJack,\" Brett said. \"I have now filed my witness statement and it remains to be seen whether or not [Leveson] wants to call me in.\" At a conference to discuss press regulation at the Institute of Government last night, Brett openly admitted that when he initially gave the Times advice about the NightJack story he \"stupidly\" concentrated too much on the Data Protection Act, which has a public interest defence, rather than the Computer Misuse Act, which does not.. This was when the reporter, Patrick Foster, initially wrote the story and sought legal advice internally from Brett admitting that he had guessed the password into the blogger's email account, according to Harding's Leveson inquiry witness statement. Brett told him the story was dead in the water unless he could identify Horton through legitimate means. At the Leveson inquiry in February, Harding publicly apologised to Horton for the paper hacking into his email account. \"I sorely regret the intrusion into Richard Horton's email account by a journalist. I'm sure that Mr Horton and many other people expect better of the Times, and so do I. So on behalf of the paper, I apologise,\" he said. Harding added that he had not been told the paper was going to court to try and overturn an injunction obtained by Horton preventing his identification by the paper, nor that the blogger's email had been hacked. He said that had he been told the email account had been hacked into, the journalist would have faced disciplinary action and the story abandoned. \"I would have said that the intrusion was not warranted in the public interest.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron put responsible business back at the top of the news agenda last week. He argued at the Business in the Community annual conference that business is \"the most powerful force for social progress the world has ever known\". Drawing on criticisms of corporate social responsibility, he suggested that companies no longer see corporate responsibility merely in terms of winning more business. He cited BT and Starbucks as examples of companies that actively pursue social good \u2013 that walk the talk \u2013 rather than donating money to ethical charities to do good works on their behalves. The role of business in society has been a feature of the political playing field since Ed Miliband made it the centrepiece of his Labour conference speech last September. Although criticised for lacking substance, his distinction between predatory and productive businesses has restarted debate about the role and responsibilities of businesses beyond the bottom line. But the rhetoric on what responsible, or moral, business should look like in practice has remained firmly in the space of the boardroom. Cameron focuses on the values of business leaders as the means by which responsible capitalism can be practiced and organisations such as the Charities Aid Foundation say that business' culture is set by leaders, who should be an example for employees. This is very much in the vein of traditional CSR, emphasising high-level corporate strategy as the space in which ethics can be incorporated into business activity. But where is the shop floor in all of this? Ipsos MORI data suggests it is actually frontline workers who are driving the CSR agenda in businesses, not corporate boardrooms. Governed by social conscience and core values, employees increasingly want to feel that they are doing the right thing. The Community Footprint, a new report by the Royal Society of Arts, finds that business can be at its most responsible and socially valuable when it focuses its CSR activities on local retail spaces and uses frontline staff rather than business leaders as their CSR champions. Working with DIY retailer B&amp;Q, the report found that investing in local communities and people, for instance, by having a staff member who is dedicated to helping customers learn new skills or develop stronger local support networks, was one of the most powerful means of living ethical values in practice. This is real business in the community. There are pioneering examples of businesses practising responsible capitalism in the communities in which they are based. Using a selection of stores across the country, M&amp;S has been offering placements to homeless people that include training and other support. More than 20% of participants ended the scheme with a job either at M&amp;S or with other employers. At B&amp;Q, local stores work directly with social landlords to provide repair materials and support local independent businesses through the Tradepoint initiative. An important by-product of such initiatives is the positive brand benefits that businesses accruing with both existing employees and with customers. Almost half (47%) of jobseekers say they are more likely to join or stay with a company that addresses social issues and 70% of customers say they will remain loyal to a brand that demonstrates local social value, even in a recession. Responsible capitalism needs to move out of the boardroom and into our communities. Political rhetoric continues to focus on supply-side, high-level initiatives but neglects the people and places closest to businesses. This needs to change. Frontline staff, high street stores and local places should be at the heart of responsible business in the community. Emma Norris is associate director at the Royal Society of the Arts.

      "bodyText": "Vendor goes into next week's Fred Winter Hurdle as one of the best-backed horses of the Cheltenham Festival, but a clear-cut victory could provide further embarrassment for handicappers struggling to match up French handicap ratings with British form. Vendor's running and that of Triolo D'Alene, Ulck Du Lin and Saphir River will all be closely monitored with the strong suspicion that French imports have been let in lightly at the weights in the Festival's handicap races. Ever since betting opened for the Fred Winter, Vendor has proved popular with clued-up punters and interest grew further when the trainer Alan King went on record last week to state clearly that he regards the horse as at least the equal of his other exciting juvenile runners, Grumeti and Balder Succes. Since the race's inception in 2005, the Fred Winter is a contest which has tested the British Horseracing Authority handicappers like no other, due mainly to the lack of available evidence. However, Vendor has had seven races over hurdles and there is plenty to go on in assessing his form \u2013 instead, his sympathetic treatment at the weights stems from his French origins. He bids to become the latest of a number of horses taking advantage of handicap marks that have come with them from France, but which appear to seriously underestimate their true ability. The exact process through which a French handicap rating, which is measured in kilos rather than pounds, is translated to a British figure isn't entirely clear and the waters are muddied further by the fact that horses with identical French marks have ended up with different British ratings. But what we do know about Vendor is that he arrived with a rating of 122, despite having been still challenging when falling at the last in the French equivalent of the Triumph Hurdle in November, the Prix Cambaceres at Auteuil, on his final start for Emmanuel Clayeux. That mark was raised to 127 when Vendor beat Tango De Juilley, his only meaningful rival, on his only British start at Newbury, and was then upped again to 129 when Tango De Juilley subsequently finished fourth to Grumeti and Pearl Swan at Cheltenham. However, King believes that 129 still underestimates Vendor. Are the British handicappers being tied too much to his original inaccurate French rating? The BHA head of handicapping, Phil Smith, denies this is the case. \"All of the British handicappers have the right to change a French rating whenever they see fit and they often do so,\" he said. \"We get the ratings from France-Galop and then re-evaluate them as we need to. \"The slight problem with Vendor is that French handicappers don't take races which ended with a fall into account so they disregarded his run at Auteuil. But we were able to get him to 127 when he beat Tango de Juilley and then raised that when we put Tango De Juilley up to 134 for finishing fourth behind Grumeti \u2013 that allows a length and a half for Vendor's mistake at the last as we valued him for three lengths over Tango de Juilley, who was giving him 10lb.\" However, even this argument is vulnerable given that Tango De Juilley is another horse who achieved his rating largely on the basis of French form which appears to have been undervalued. The latest name to add to the list of mis-handicapped French horses is Balgarry, off the track for almost two years since winning a conditions hurdle at Clairefontaine in August 2010, but an easy winner on his British debut for David Pipe when being pitched straight into handicap company off his French rating at Newbury on Saturday. Smith denies that there is a problem with using French ratings or the mechanism by which they are converted for use in Britain. \"I've got absolute confidence in the French handicappers,\" he said. \"You look at all of those big 'Tierce' handicaps and how close they finish. The alternative explanation is that some British trainers are better than some French trainers and improve some of the horses, but that's not something I'd want to say. \"If a horse comes with a rating that looks wrong, the handicapper always has the opportunity to change it. We're not bound to them.\" Are French ratings underestimating horses switched to be trained in this country? Further evidence will be found next week when the aforementioned quartet line up. Ulck Du Lin, two from three over hurdles in France, makes his British debut for Paul Nicholls in the Fred Winter. Nicholls denies keeping the horse back for the race is a plot, but the prospect of a rating of 130 underestimating his ability must be at the back of the trainer's mind. Nicholls' runner has been well publicised and punted, but Saphir River has flown considerably lower under the radar. Second in a Grade One at Auteuil in November on his final start in France, six-year-old Saphir River was sold just days later for \u20ac280,000 and has since joined Mike Scudamore in Herefordshire. He holds entries in a number of races at the Festival, but is reportedly an intended starter in the Pertemps Final on Thursday where he gets in with a mark of 139. Scudamore reports that he went to Newbury for a racecourse gallop last weekend where this \"very exciting horse\" worked \"very, very well\". The idea of allowing horses from France to run in British handicaps without qualifying runs is noble enough, but it isn't quite working. Results at the Festival may show next week whether what's required is a gentle tweak or a more sizeable overhaul to the system.",

      "body": "<p>Vendor goes into next week's Fred Winter Hurdle as one of the best-backed horses of the Cheltenham Festival, but a clear-cut victory could provide further embarrassment for handicappers struggling to match up French handicap ratings with British form.</p> <p>Vendor's running and that of Triolo D'Alene, Ulck Du Lin and Saphir River will all be closely monitored with the strong suspicion that French imports have been let in lightly at the weights in the Festival's handicap races.</p> <p>Ever since betting opened for the Fred Winter, Vendor has proved popular with clued-up punters and interest grew further when the trainer Alan King went on record last week to state clearly that he regards the horse as at least the equal of his other exciting juvenile runners, Grumeti and Balder Succes.</p> <p>Since the race's inception in 2005, the Fred Winter is a contest which has tested the British Horseracing Authority handicappers like no other, due mainly to the lack of available evidence. However, Vendor has had seven races over hurdles and there is plenty to go on in assessing his form \u2013 instead, his sympathetic treatment at the weights stems from his French origins. He bids to become the latest of a number of horses taking advantage of handicap marks that have come with them from France, but which appear to seriously underestimate their true ability.</p> <p>The exact process through which a French handicap rating, which is measured in kilos rather than pounds, is translated to a British figure isn't entirely clear and the waters are muddied further by the fact that horses with identical French marks have ended up with different British ratings.</p> <p>But what we do know about Vendor is that he arrived with a rating of 122, despite having been still challenging when falling at the last in the French equivalent of the Triumph Hurdle in November, the Prix Cambaceres at Auteuil, on his final start for Emmanuel Clayeux.</p> <p>That mark was raised to 127 when Vendor beat Tango De Juilley, his only meaningful rival, on his only British start at Newbury, and was then upped again to 129 when Tango De Juilley subsequently finished fourth to Grumeti and Pearl Swan at Cheltenham. However, King believes that 129 still underestimates Vendor. Are the British handicappers being tied too much to his original inaccurate French rating?</p> <p>The BHA head of handicapping, Phil Smith, denies this is the case. \"All of the British handicappers have the right to change a French rating whenever they see fit and they often do so,\" he said. \"We get the ratings from France-Galop and then re-evaluate them as we need to.</p> <p>\"The slight problem with Vendor is that French handicappers don't take races which ended with a fall into account so they disregarded his run at Auteuil. But we were able to get him to 127 when he beat Tango de Juilley and then raised that when we put Tango De Juilley up to 134 for finishing fourth behind Grumeti \u2013 that allows a length and a half for Vendor's mistake at the last as we valued him for three lengths over Tango de Juilley, who was giving him 10lb.\"</p> <p>However, even this argument is vulnerable given that Tango De Juilley is another horse who achieved his rating largely on the basis of French form which appears to have been undervalued.</p> <p>The latest name to add to the list of mis-handicapped French horses is Balgarry, off the track for almost two years since winning a conditions hurdle at Clairefontaine in August 2010, but an easy winner on his British debut for David Pipe when being pitched straight into handicap company off his French rating at Newbury on Saturday.</p> <p>Smith denies that there is a problem with using French ratings or the mechanism by which they are converted for use in Britain.</p> <p>\"I've got absolute confidence in the French handicappers,\" he said. \"You look at all of those big 'Tierce' handicaps and how close they finish. The alternative explanation is that some British trainers are better than some French trainers and improve some of the horses, but that's not something I'd want to say.</p> <p>\"If a horse comes with a rating that looks wrong, the handicapper always has the opportunity to change it. We're not bound to them.\"</p> <p>Are French ratings underestimating horses switched to be trained in this country? Further evidence will be found next week when the aforementioned quartet line up.</p> <p>Ulck Du Lin, two from three over hurdles in France, makes his British debut for Paul Nicholls in the Fred Winter. Nicholls denies keeping the horse back for the race is a plot, but the prospect of a rating of 130 underestimating his ability must be at the back of the trainer's mind.</p> <p>Nicholls' runner has been well publicised and punted, but Saphir River has flown considerably lower under the radar.

      "bodyText": "A half-hour documentary on a Ugandan rebel leader that has been watched by tens of millions online has been broadcast in full on Australian television. The film's subject is Joseph Kony, leader of Ugandan rebel group the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). It was posted online by the US-based group Invisible Children, which aimed to use the power of social media to make him \"famous\" and, by doing so, raise his profile enough so world powers such as the United States were motivated to intervene and help capture him. The film has been viewed more than 26m times since being uploaded to YouTube on Monday. It has almost 12m views on Vimeo, where it was first posted in February. In Australia Kony 2012 quickly moved from social media to mainstream TV with an hour-long special on the national television network, Ten, on Thursday evening. The commercial network broadcast the half-hour film uninterrupted, saying it had responded to tweets and the \"Kony-fication of our Facebook page\". Kony stands accused of appalling crimes, including the kidnap, torture and rape of children. The LRA began its campaign of terror in northern Uganda more than 20 years ago, originally in what it called a fight for a biblical state and the rights of the Acholi people. Since then Kony has been indicted for crimes against humanity at the international criminal court. The film's narrator is Invisible Children's Jason Russell. He visited Uganda nearly 10 years ago and met a boy who feared for his life because of Kony. Russell promised the boy he would help stop the LRA and Kony 2012 is part of that campaign. Russell says Kony is the \"most wanted man in the world according to the international criminal court\", and his documentary aims to put the name into every household's conversation. Through lobbying cultural and political leaders in the United States, Invisible Children wants to pressure the White House to continue its assistance to the Ugandan army in capturing Kony. Last year the US sent 100 military advisers to Uganda. \"If the government doesn't know people care, they will not keep them there,\" Russell says in the film. \"They will only know if Kony's name is everywhere.\" The film has been criticised in some quarters as promoting neo-colonialism by trying to get outside powers, primarily the US, to intervene to capture Kony. Others have said Kony is no longer believed to be operating in Uganda and, by some accounts, has not been for six years and his LRA is down to just a few hundred men. There has also been criticism from some parts of the charity sector about how Invisible Children spends its money.",

      "bodyText": "For Liverpool supporters, the desire to gain justice for the 96 fans who died at Hillsborough in 1989 burns as brightly now as it did back then. Recent months have seen the fight move to parliament, with hundreds of thousands of people signing petitions calling for a full disclosure of documents relating to the tragedy and in the case of one victim, Kevin Williams, a fresh inquest into the cause of death. Next up, however, comes perhaps the most unique endeavour undertaken in this fight and one that proves Kopites are willing to give their bodies as well as hearts and souls to the cause. On 12 April, three days before the 23rd anniversary of the tragedy, six Liverpool supporters will embark on a 76-mile run from the memorial to the 96 at Hillsborough to the pitch at Anfield, in time for their team's Premier League match with Fulham on 14 April. All money raised from the effort, whose motto is \"3-6-76-96\", will be donated to the Hillsborough Justice Campaign and the Hillsborough Families Support Group, with this being the first time the two bodies have been involved in the same initiative. The six runners are Neil Mitchell, Chris Dale, John Driscoll, Wesley Young, Earle Jackson \u2013 who was at Liverpool's fateful FA Cup semi-final tie with Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 \u2013 and Dominic Williams \u2013 whose brainchild this run is. \"I've become a keen runner over the past eight months or so and, in that time, done a few charity runs,\" Williams says. \"At the same time I have always been a big supporter of the justice campaign and after coming across the mosaic for the 96 at the club museum prior to our opening match of this season, against Sunderland, it clicked \u2013 I should combine the two; run in the name of the Hillsborough victims. \"I looked to see if it had been done before, and whether it was possible or not. I first thought that maybe it should be a 96 mile-run, but then decided to focus on running from Hillsborough to Anfield. It was then a case of speaking to the relevant authorities, such as Liverpool city council, to make sure it could be done. Thankfully nobody objected.\" The six runners, backed by a nine-strong support team that includes two physios, a press officer and a cycle-bound outrider whose job it is to make sure nobody gets lost, intend to pound through the Trans-Pennine Trail, covering 30 miles on day one, which will take them to Hyde, and another 30 miles on day two, which should see the group reach Widnes. It is then a 16-mile run through Liverpool itself, with Anfield the final destination. \"The support we have received has been superb,\" Williams says. \"The Holiday Inn in Sheffield has given us complimentary rooms for the night before we set off, while the Village Hotel in Hyde and the Everglades Park Hotel in Widnes have also agreed to put us up after each of the first two days. For Liverpool to allow us to finish the run on the pitch in front of a full house at Anfield is the icing on the cake, a dream come true.\" That dream will be somewhat scuppered should Kenny Dalglish's side progress to the FA Cup semi-finals, which are being played at Wembley that weekend. In that circumstance, however, the club has said the runners can still enter the stadium on 14 April and then receive a richly deserved round of applause from the Kop before Liverpool's next home match, against West Bromwich Albion, on 22 April. With a little over a month to go before the run the only remaining concern, then, is whether or not the six runners will be able to stay the distance. They are all doing the training required and for Williams in particular, this challenge represents an extension of a pursuit for peak fitness. \"I gave up smoking last May having been a 20-a-day man and have since done over 20 half-marathons and two full marathons,\" says the 36-year-old father of three, who used to work as a stable boy for the champion trainer Paul Nicholls. \"I've also drastically cut my drinking and upped the amount of swimming I do. I'm on a personal journey and this is just the start for me.\" The run has gained a huge amount of attention within Liverpool as well as garnering the backing of local MP Steve Rotherham, who himself is a staunch supporter of the justice campaign, and the public approval of the two groups set to benefit from the money raised. \"Seventy-six miles for 96 fans is absolutely amazing,\" says Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group. \"You can't thank these people enough for keeping the profile of Hillsborough going.\" Kenny Derbyshire, chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, says: \"You've got to give credit to these people. It's a hard task and all you can do is wish them all the best and say thank you.\" For Williams, who was raised in Allerton, south Liverpool and first visited Anfield in 1988, recognition and thanks are secondary to his desire to fight on behalf of those who lost their lives and suffered injury in his club's darkest hour. \"For any Liverpool supporter this is a cause which will forever live in our hearts,\" he says. \"Unless you're from the city you perhaps do not understand the sense of community that exists in Liverpool and Hillsborough was a tragedy which affected the whole community. No Liverpudlian, red or blue, has forgotten what happened and 23 years on we remain as determined as ever to make sure the 96 did not die in vain and that the authorities do not get away with what they did, or rather did not do, on that day. The run is our chance to play a part in the wider cause.\" To contribute to the Hillsborough to Anfield run, visit www.hillsborough-anfieldrun.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "What's currently the main preoccupation of the French? Unemployment? The fate of the euro? Spending power? No. It's halal meat, the ritual way of killing animals by Muslims for human consumption. At least, that's what outgoing president and candidate for his own re-election Nicolas Sarkozy told an audience this week. His claim raised eyebrows as some thought it strange to focus on this topic when France and Europe were in the middle of the debt crisis, with unemployment on the rise. But these are election times in France, and the explanation for Sarkozy's statement lies in one name: Marine Le Pen. Three weeks earlier, the candidate for the extreme right anti-immigration National Front, raised the halal question in a very provocative way. She claimed \u2013 wrongly \u2013 that all the meat on sale in the greater Paris region was killed in the Muslim ritual way, without consumers being informed. In the wake of this statement, Sarkozy was visiting the Rungis wholesale market for food, outside Paris. He pointed out that the true figure was that only 2.5% of the meat consumed in the greater Paris region was halal, and that it was not an issue. But opinion polls show Sarkozy's campaign in great difficulty, trailing behind the Socialist party candidate Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and permanently threatened by Le Pen in third place. No one was surprised, therefore, to hear interior minister Claude Gu\u00e9ant, a close ally and confidant of Sarkozy, attack the Socialists at the end of last week, claiming that their proposal to allow foreign residents in French towns to vote for local elections would lead to halal meat being imposed on all children in public school canteens. His argument was that foreigners with voting rights might influence local governments and push their own agenda \u2013 whether in school canteens, or in public swimming pools with separate hours for men and women. The argument quickly became a running joke on Twitter: some commentators said that if Alsacians had voting rights, children would have to eat choucroute, Alsace's national dish, or if people from France's southwest could vote, they would eat foie gras and drink Bordeaux wine \u2026 The jokes stopped two days later when Sarkozy, in a major election speech, proposed a change to the law to impose transparency on the way animals were killed, a U-turn on his earlier comment that this was not an issue. This statement provoked anger not only among Muslims, who felt they were being used as an electioneering tool, but also Jews whose kosher meat follows the same ritual ways of killing as halal meat. Richard Prasquier, the head of the Jewish representative council in France, condemned the claims. He had been, until then, a staunch Sarkozy supporter. Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, spokeswoman of Sarkozy's campaign, distanced herself from the controversy. Obviously Le Pen, having imposed her political agenda to the outgoing president, is laughing all the way to the polling booth, which is adding to the sense of panic in the presidential camp. Sarkozy had hoped that his official entry into the campaign would boost his support in opinion polls, pushing him into first place in the first round of voting on 22 April. Two weeks later, Sarkozy is still trailing far behind his Socialist rival, with a still strong Le Pen in third place. Sarkozy has decided to push his campaign further to the right for the first round, before focusing again on a more centrist approach for the second round. The initial result is to alienate further centrist voters, without convincing extreme rightwing supporters that he really means it. Many commentators in France feel the game is already over. It is obviously too early to conclude, but the halal episode is a sure sign that the tactical genius of 2007 has lost his touch. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "The Colosseum may be one of Rome's main tourist attractions, but wander up the slight incline away from the famous amphitheatre and you'll find endless gems of architecture, craft, fashion and restaurants tucked away in narrow streets and quiet corners. Formerly the city's seedy underbelly \u2013 where prostitutes and outlaws took refuge until as recently as the 1940s \u2013 Monti is now an enclave for the city's young, creative flock, and has the new upstarts to prove it. Strolling the cobblestone streets, you're likely to hear the hum of a designer's sewing machine or the thud of a hammer in a jeweller's shop. The neighbourhood, named after one of Rome's seven famous hills, marries modernity with historical charm \u2013 from the fresh new ventures rubbing up against centuries of crumbling craftsmanship to the dapper signore ordering his cafe next to a bedraggled hipster. Smaller and less touristy than the nightlife hub of Trastevere, it retains a strong community vibe. Read on to get a view of the neighbourhood that's off your standard guidebook grid. Ai Tre Scallini You'll know you've arrived at this enoteca when you spot hordes of wine-glass-grasping Italians spilling out of a stooped, ivy-lined doorway. Though it's always jam-packed, this watering hole still carries a familial vibe, and you'll often spot owners Adriano and Barbara greeting regulars with a double kiss. The rustic, wooden bar is stocked with a wide-range of Lazio wines as well as a few old-school beers on tap, and small plates are served for both lunch and dinner. We're fans of the mouthwatering melanzane di parmigiano, polpettine al sugo (meatballs in a tomato sauce), and the ricotta cheese paired with truffle honey. They don't take reservations and the place is full by 7pm, so plan to sip a glass standing up while you wait for your table. \u2022 Via Panisperna 251, +39 06 4890 7495, wix.com/colosseoorg/aitrescalini. Open every day Mercato Monti What started as a way for several Monti shop owners to burn through some overstock has now turned into a fully fledged vintage market. Led by local boutique owner Fabrizio Marin and ex-music agent Ornella Cicchetti, the market mixes together 35 seemingly disparate vendors every Sunday. Cicchetti prides herself on featuring only the most beautiful items, and you'll find everything from bold jewels, saucer-like glasses, special-edition Polaroid cameras and handmade glass-blown baubles sprinkled throughout the space. And the clothing is not only vintage \u2013 there are also fantastical pieces by emerging fashion designers. \u2022 Hotel Palatino Via Leonina 46/48, mercatomonti.com. Every Sunday (except the last of the month) 10am \u2013 8pm Casa Clementina As the old adage says, there's no place like home. And you can find your home in Rome at this new bar styled after a fashionable 60s abode. Complete with a kitchen (pots and pans included) a parlour with a sofa, and even a plush bed in the back room, the space has a cool-yet-domestic vibe. All objects are for sale, from the wine in the fridge to the fabulous clothes hanging in the closet, and there are drinks and snacks to fuel your roaming and buying. It opened in December 2011 and has quickly become the new hip hangout for the city's creative crowd. This gives it an interesting blend of homey and haute: feel free to put your feet up, just remember that your shoes are being judged. \u2022 Via Clementina 9, Casa Clementina on Facebook. Open every day La Carbonara This old-school trattoria has been churning out delicious Roman fare since 1906. Owned by the Rossi family \u2013 with Mama Teresa taking the culinary helm and son Andrea working the front of house \u2013 the restaurant has become a neighbourhood institution. It's hip (Roman musicians and actors frequently stop by), yet cosy with tables packed close together and customers being encouraged to scribble notes on the walls after their meal. The artichoke antipasto selections (both Judea and Romana) are superb, and standout primis are the carbonara and the strozzapreti. For your second course, try venturing into the world of quinto quarto (Roman offal dishes), and go for the tripe or coda alla vaccinara (oxtail stew). \u2022 Via Panisperna 214, +39 06 482 5176, lacarbonara.it/; Closed Sunday. Antico Forno ai Serpenti When this place opened in December 2011, owner Alessando Santomauro envisioned creating a modern space that churns out traditional Italian treats. For the food, he enlisted Sergio Conti \u2013 hailing from a long line of bakers \u2013 who's on site every day overseeing the production of his family's recipes. And for design, Santomauro enlisted two local architects to create a French chic atmosphere that strays from the typical forno format. Stop by in the morning for delicious cornetti or in the afternoon for a slice of pizza bianca, a simple Roman style pizza topped with only olive oil and salt. Guests love their misshaped brutti ma buoni (ugly but good) gluten-free cookies and la mela in camicia, a flaky pastry filled with cinnamon-topped apples. \u2022 Corner of Via dei Serpenti and Via Panisperna. Open every day (on Sunday until 2pm) Mia Market It's easy to picture this quirky organic cafe/market set against the seaside in some Californian beach town. Walls are draped in aged magazine paper, wooden crates overflow with seasonal produce, and fresh eggs and tarts are on display. Serving food exclusively from the region of Lazio, their quiche-like tortes are delicious, as are their soups and salads. Customers can dine at the mismatched tables and chairs, and the fact that you need to fetch your wooden, biodegradable spoon from the cupboard further emphasises the cosy atmosphere. Make sure you check out the shelves \u2013 laden with artisanal food products such as olive oils, jams, sauces, teas, and organic fruit juices \u2013 before you hit the cobblestone road. \u2022 Via Panisperna 225,+39 06 4782 4611, miamarket.blogspot.com. Closed Sunday Pulp Only a few minutes from the Via Cavour metro station, this funky and fun vintage shop is still making a sartorial splash nearly a decade after its launch. The brainchild of Fabio Brumeccini and Fabrizio Polanschiand, Pulp features a tightly edited collection of vintage and resale clothes (ranging from \u20ac15-\u20ac70), with classic staple pieces displayed next to kitsch prints in bold hues and a superb selection of shoes and accessories are sprinkled throughout. And here's something that will excite dedicated followers of fashion: the shop receives new weekly pieces from exclusive designer vintage collections (think Gucci and Chanel). You can even tweak them thanks to their tailoring service. \u2022 Via del Boschetto 140, +39 06 485511. Closed Sunday Relais Rome Sweet Home Fori Imperiali Tucked down a charming residential street, this B&amp;B allows you to experience the real-deal Roman life, but is still central enough that you can walk everywhere. The four rooms are modern and spacious; the detached suite with handmade terra cotta floors and a high, exposed wood ceiling is gorgeous. Upon arrival, you'll be handed the keys, as well as a very helpful guide to the neighbourhood, and then left to your own devices \u2013 although owner Bernardo is always a phone call away if you need him. Also, each morning he prepares a simple breakfast for guests, which he leaves on a tray outside their door. There's no permanent reception, so either arrange a time to meet Bernardo, or have your cell phone handy to call (there's a number listed at the buzzer). Contact directly for better deals. \u2022 Via Madonna dei Monti 96, +39 06 699 0667, relaisromesweethome.it. Doubles from around \u20ac165 per night B&amp;B (two-night minimum) Vino Roma Drinking wine and Italy go hand in hand. Get a better grasp on what you're tasting with a quick crash course at Vino Roma, where owner Hande dishes up wisdom on the culture and history of Italian wine and reveals fun facts that you can spout off at your next trip to the enoteca. The all-levels classes are held in a sleek and modern tasting room and the atmosphere is relaxed (serious sippers beware!) and hands-on. You can go online and chose from an array of interesting classes, such as Wine and Cheese Lunch, with a gorgeous spread of cheese, meats, and seasonal produce, or Sparkly Saturdays, where Hande pays homage to her love of the bubbly. \u2022 \u20ac50 for each course. Via in Selci 84, mail@vinoroma.com Fontana di Piazza della Madonna dei Monti Located in the heart of Monti, the piazzetta has become a sort of local gathering spot. At lunch, you'll find young Romans on benches tucking into piadinas (flatbread from the Emilia-Romagna district) from the nearby and beloved Piadineria, and at night you'll find groups merrily sharing bottles of wine on the marble steps. The flowing fountain was built by Giacomo della Porta in 1588, who also built the nearby Madonna dei Monti church, and served as the district's main water supply back in the day. It's simple and modest as far as fountains go, but it's the perfect place to relax and refuel on a sunny day. \u2022 La Piadineria, Via del Boschetto 98, +39 06 489 07923, lapiadineria.com.

Owned by the Rossi family \u2013 with Mama Teresa taking the culinary helm and son Andrea working the front of house \u2013 the restaurant has become a neighbourhood institution. It's hip (Roman musicians and actors frequently stop by), yet cosy with tables packed close together and customers being encouraged to scribble notes on the walls after their meal. The artichoke antipasto selections (both Judea and Romana) are superb, and standout primis are the carbonara and the strozzapreti.

For the food, he enlisted Sergio Conti \u2013 hailing from a long line of bakers \u2013 who's on site every day overseeing the production of his family's recipes. And for design, Santomauro enlisted two local architects to create a French chic atmosphere that strays from the typical forno format. Stop by in the morning for delicious cornetti or in the afternoon for a slice of pizza bianca, a simple Roman style pizza topped with only olive oil and salt.

Serving food exclusively from the region of Lazio, their quiche-like tortes are delicious, as are their soups and salads. Customers can dine at the mismatched tables and chairs, and the fact that you need to fetch your wooden, biodegradable spoon from the cupboard further emphasises the cosy atmosphere.

      "bodyText": "In the aftermath of the March 11, 2011 tsunami and nuclear meltdown in Japan, the US government advised its citizens living in Pacific island nation to stay at least 50 miles away from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant as a precautionary measure. Yet as we near the first anniversary of the Japan tragedy, the emergency evacuation zone around all nuclear reactors in the US, at least 23 of which are the same kind as the Fukushima reactors, is still limited to a 10-mile radius. This is just one among many safety measures that haven't been adequately, and speedily, addressed when it comes to protecting nuclear plants and US citizens against severe, unexpected accidents, says nuclear industry watchdog, Union for Concerned Scientists (UCS). In a report on Tuesday, UCS called out the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), that oversees the country's commercial nuclear power plants, for failing to implement key recommendations made by NRC's own task force last summer that would bolster plant safety. The report, \"U.S. Nuclear Power Safety One Year After Fukushima,\" also criticizes the nuclear industry of jumping the gun by investing cheap and generic safety equipment before the NRC has even had time to examine if the equipment would actually help protect the public. A major flaw in the NRC's approach, the report says, is that it has relegated to the bottom of the priority list, the task force's \"first and primary recommendation\" \u2014 to clarify its \"patchwork\" regulatory framework for dealing with severe, unprecedented events (\"beyond design basis\" event, in tehno-speak) that US reactors aren't built to withstand, such as combined earthquake and tsunami like the one at Fukushima or a terrorist attack. At present, the regulations for what safety measures should be taken, what kind of equipment should be used etc., in the case of such \"beyond design basis\" events are not all clearly specified. Many of these measures are \"voluntary,\" that is plant owners aren't legally bound to implement them. Nor is it required that these extra measures meet any uniform high quality and reliability standards. The NRC task force's first recommendation sought to change that. By not addressing it before doing anything else, the NRC \"has put the cart before the horse\" and \"potentially undermined the effectiveness of the other recommendations, which all hinge on this critical issue,\" says Dave Lochbaum, director of the UCS Nuclear Safety Program. For instance, the NRC task force recommended that NRC should require plant owners to install diesel-fuel pumps and generators to protect against \"station blackouts\", when the plant loses both on-site and off-site backup power during a \"beyond design basis\" event like a terrorist attack by air. But the recommendation doesn't require that this equipment meet high quality and reliability standards, or be hardened to withstand other potential threats, such as say floods or earthquakes. \"It didn't consider the potential for multiple unit accidents at the site and as a result the current US standards aren't good enough to protect against a Fukushima like disaster,\" says Edwin Lyman, another senior UCS scientist who co-wrote the report along with Lochbaum. Most of the safety measures at American plants are based on science and assumptions that are decades old, says Lyman. Regarding the evacuation zone, NRC spokesperson Scott Burnell told the Journal today that the 10-mile evacuation radius (which the NRC did review last year and decided to stick with) is based on sound research. There were provisions to expand the scope of evacuations in the event of a serious accident, especially since research shows that such accidents progress slowly, over several days, he said. Besides, he said, \"the situation in Fukushima could not be duplicated in the US.\" UCS scientists disagree on that last bit. And they counter that the agency has yet explain how it would expand the scope of evacuations during an unprecedented crisis. \"If you are talking about a reactor in a rural, lightly populated area that's one thing,\" says Lochbaum. \"But if you are talking about a reactor in a densely populated area like Indian Point in New York or San Onefrey in LA's Orange County metropolitan area, then it would really strain credulity to think that in the aftermath of the an accident like Fukushima they would be able to effectively evacuate people within a day or two that would be need to actually protect them. Instead of a \"one-size-fits all\" approach, evacuation zones should be evaluated on a site-specific basis because much depends on the particular meteorological conditions of the region, the terrain and other specific features of the plant sites, he says. The NRC too has admitted that it was behind schedule in improving safety at the plants. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal yesterday, NRC chairman Gregory Jaczko said the agency \"risked failing to meet its goal of making all the regulatory changes within five years.\" But spokesperson Burnell defended the delay, writing in an emailed statement that implementing the recommendations \"efficiently and appropriately\" requires time. \"Issuing rushed, incomplete requirements would waste both the NRC's and the industry's resources and complicate the overall goal of enhancing U.S. reactor safety,\" he said. (Tardiness does seem to be a problem with the NRC though. It appears the commission took 10 years to fully implement new security measures in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.) Meanwhile, it seems the nuclear industry itself is practicing no such caution, moving ahead as it is with changes on the ground under a new initiative, also announced yesterday, called the Diverse and Flexible Coping Capability, or FLEX, program. As part of this initiative, plant owners are stocking up on, and installing, additional emergency equipment like generators and pumps, much to UCS' dismay, which believes that in this case \"speed is not a virtue.\" None of these equipment have been vetted by the NRC. Buying the equipment without waiting for NRC guidelines, just makes it difficult for the agency to later implement standards that could force the industry to replace the equipment, says Lyman. \"The rationale for what the industry is doing is pretty clear,\" he says. \"The logic here is if you buy a lot of relatively cheap, commercial grade equipment, you scatter it around and you hope for the best that some of it will still be there [during a major disaster].\" No big surprise there surely. Meanwhile, a new survey conducted for the nonprofit and nonpartisan Civil Society Institute shows that \"Americans continue to want to keep the brakes on more nuclear power in the United States.\"",

      "bodyText": "Maybe Jason Russell's web-based film Kony 2012, calling for international action to stop the Ugandan war criminal Joseph Kony, can't be considered great documentary-making. But as a piece of digital polemic and digital activism, it is quite simply brilliant. It's a slick, high-gloss piece of work, distributed on the Vimeo site, the upscale version of YouTube for serious film-makers. And its sensational, exponential popularity-growth on the web is already achieving one of its stated objectives: to make Kony famous, to publicise this psychopathic warlord's grotesque crimes: kidnapping thousands of children and turning them into mercenaries, butchers and rapists. It does not stick to the conventions of impartial journalism, in the BBC style. It is partisan, tactless and very bold. But it could be seen as insufferably condescending, a way of making US college kids feel good about themselves. And is Russell scared to come out and admit that effective action entails an old-fashioned boots-on-soil invasion of a landlocked African country, with plenty of collateral damage and civilian death? It is actually two minutes into the film before we hear what it is supposed to be about. Visual mood music invokes the world and all its peoples. Russell juggles the cliches of US presidential campaigns and corporate imagery. We see senior citizens chat to their grandkids via Skype. We see a beautiful Earth suspended in space, in fact, we see everything but fields of green, red roses too. It looks like an ad for Nike or Adidas or even Enron.

Russell begins by invoking the social network and the world of YouTube, Twitter and Facebook so fervently, so passionately, that the movie begins by being about its own future viral success , a prophecy now extravagantly fulfilled. He shuffles in graphics in the manner of Michael Moore and Al Gore; he deploys the language and rhetoric of grassroots campaigning, channelled campus energy. This is the world of Occupy and Obama 08.

Interestingly, this is intended partly to pay for tracking devices which will warn Ugandan villagers about Kony's approach with his shock-troops: the technology is a cousin to the social networking hardware and software mobilising western support. Russell isn't afraid of brash emotionalism. He tugs and wrenches at the heartstrings. He interviews his cute little boy Gavin, and even shows the wacky home-movie videos he makes with him in the garden, with spoof explosion effects using the Action Movie app on his iPhone. (Full disclosure: I do exactly the same thing with my little boy.) But this can get toe-curling, especially when he interviews Gavin about the \"bad guy\" he is facing. You won't find the BBC's John Simpson doing this. And are we, the audience, being talked down to? Treated like kids? Well, yes, a little. But there's no doubting the force of this film. It is sometimes conceited and cliched, and Russell does not detain the viewer with exactly how much western intervention he expects, and what the downside is. Nevertheless, Kony 2012 lands an almighty punch. This is a principled campaign ad, and a very, very effective one.",

But as a piece of digital polemic and digital activism, it is quite simply brilliant. It's a slick, high-gloss piece of work, distributed on the Vimeo site, the upscale version of YouTube for serious film-makers.

Dunedin doesn't always guarantee the finest weather but the sky was clear blue, the players were not sweater-swaddled as they had been, and the crowd buzzed contentedly as a tight contest began to unfold. I was struck by the setting. University Oval is just about as far away from where I am as it would be possible to find on the planet, yet nothing could look more quintessentially English in the sylvan parkland setting (and no matter that, as the name suggests, Dunedin is as English as Dunbar or Edinburgh). Think, perhaps, Chesterfield. The cricket seemed comfortable in this environment, a small provincial theatre rather than the grand stages of the West End. In a country, by no means unique, that is struggling to make Test cricket relevant to the sporting calendar, the New Zealand authorities reason sensibly that it is far better for the players, the spectators themselves, and, not least, televisual appearance, to have a large crowd in a small venue than a small crowd in a large one. It is one of the reasons I enjoyed playing county outgrounds and festivals, where a ring of spectators four or five deep created an atmosphere that empty Test match arenas could not provide. Anyway, the Kiwis have got this one spot-on. Four years ago, when last England toured there, they staged a brilliant series due in no small part to the venues: first the grassy banks at Hamilton, where New Zealand won and brought to a close some stellar England careers; next the famous old Basin Reserve where England revived and Jimmy Anderson made his second coming; finally the art-deco setting of Napier where Andrew Strauss supped in the last chance saloon and emerged sober. Each saw crowds that might have been matched in numbers on the rugby grounds of Auckland or Christchurch but would scarcely have been noticed on the concrete terraces. In Wellington, the Basin was sold out for the first time in many years, boosted but not monopolised by the touring Brit support seduced by the sun and sauvignon blanc. The plans are already in hand for England's tour this time next year, and the indications are that two of three Tests will be played in Dunedin, and the Basin Reserve. Only a mooted return to Eden Park, revamped for the recent Rugby World Cup but a grim cricket venue, will see a reversion to stadium type. Before they go to New Zealand, though, England will have played two series in India, the first, before Christmas, of four Tests and the second, in the new year, of ODIs. India is similar to New Zealand in the decline in interest in the longest, most challenging form of the game and it could be argued that they might draw from the Kiwi experience and schedule their Tests not in the biggest centres with the stadiums of 40,000 capacity and more but utilise smaller provincial venues ( which, I have no idea). England, of course, would fight the idea tooth and claw, but would such an idea work? Or is Test cricket a dead duck in India, beyond revival no matter where the games are played?

If successful, it will put payday loans broker Yes Loans out of business \u2013 but the firm has 28 days to appeal and can continue arranging new loans in that time due to limitations in consumer credit regulations. The OFT said Yes Loans, which operates through 10 other brands including Blue Sky Personal Finance Limited and Money Worries Limited, is \"unfit\" to hold a consumer credit licence. As part of an ongoing investigation into credit brokers, the company was found to have used high-pressure sales tactics to persuade consumers to provide their debit or credit card details on the false premise that they were needed for an identity or security check. It was also deducting fees without consumers' consent or making it clear that a fee was payable. The company frequently arranged short-term, high-interest loans instead of the original products \u2013 less expensive unsecured loans \u2013 sought by customers, and was misleading consumers into believing it was a loan provider rather than a credit broker. The OFT also said Yes Loans was treating customers poorly by not providing refunds in a timely manner. Despite Yes Loans making changes in a bid to prevent its licence from being revoked, the OFT said that evidence of prolonged engagement in deceitful and oppressive business practices, and the continuing presence of some of the staff responsible for running the businesses, makes the company unfit to hold a licence. David Fisher, director of consumer credit at the OFT, said: \"We will take decisive action to tackle businesses that fail to treat people properly, especially the most vulnerable. This action also makes it clear that belatedly changing business practices when facing the prospect of enforcement action by the OFT does not make a company fit to hold a credit licence\". In a statement, directors of Yes Loans said: \"We have all worked tirelessly to implement significant and fundamental advancements to the businesses. We are disappointed that, despite recognising this, the OFT has decided to revoke the licences of three long-standing businesses, which provide a loans brokerage service and other personal financial services to many thousands of satisfied customers. \"We are currently taking advice with regard to lodging an appeal against the decision. No jobs are at risk within the companies concerned, regardless of the outcome of any appeal. Currently and throughout any appeals process, our licences remain valid and allow us to continue to trade.\" Yes Loans, Blue Sky Personal Finance and Money Worries have 28 days to appeal the OFT's decision. But current rules mean companies are allowed to trade as before during the appeals process and do not have to tell consumers that their licence is under threat, so anyone taking out a loan during that time has no extra protection. A report published by the business, innovation and skills committee on 7 March 2012, called for a fast-track procedure to be introduced to suspend credit licences where businesses have failed to adhere to the rules. Matt Hartley, spokesman for the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, said: \"Lenders and brokers have an obligation to treat customers fairly and in the case of Yes Loans this was clearly not the case. It is essential that the OFT takes swift action to protect consumers from any company unfit to hold a consumer credit licence \u2013 this action is good news for consumers.\" The action is separate from the OFT's review of the payday loans sector, announced in late February, in which the OFT is visiting 50 major payday lenders and surveying industry and consumer organisations to determine whether companies are complying with the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and its guidance on irresponsible lending. Eight other companies surrendered their licence or withdrew their licence application following the OFT's normal investigations, including We Fight Any Claim Limited, No Worries Loans Limited, and 141 Loans Limited.",

      "bodyText": "I was delighted to see on last night's TV news that Kautilya Pruthi, Britain's answer to the Ponzi fraudster, Bernie Madoff, is facing a stiff jail sentence for stealing more than \u00a3100m from gullible investors to finance an embarrassingly vulgar lifestyle featuring lots of cars, property and swimming pools. The trial ended on Wednesday. Glad too, therefore, to read this week that the Financial Services Authority is prosecuting an ambitious case of insider trading, involving allegations at Southwark crown court that share tips were stolen from the printing operations of two of the City of London's biggest investment banks. It is part of the FSA's drive \u2013 belated, some would say \u2013 to stamp out this sort of conduct. We must wait a while, probably some time, for guilty or innocent verdicts on the seven accused. Either way, these actions deserve a cheer. Why am I so pleased? Because both suggest a willingness by the authorities to enforce the law in ways that are often painfully absent. Contrary to what is often asserted about the power of Britain's political and bureaucratic elite \u2013 my old chum Peter Oborne's ridiculous 2007 book The Triumph of the Political Class is a good example of that \u2013 we usually see a serious loss of nerve and the desire for a quiet life. Has it been getting steadily worse during my lifetime? Or is what we are seeing in terms of cover-ups exposed and demands for greater transparency and accountability \u2013 from City boardrooms to the cabinet table and beyond \u2013 a sign that Britain is getting its act together under the pressures of globalisation and is still a going concern despite its many batterings? Look around you. What is the Leveson inquiry and assorted related police investigations but a belated attempt to stand up to over-mighty media groups (Rupert, I'm talking about you) who thought they were above the law and acted accordingly. The surprise is genuine among some of my News International colleagues that the police should come after them in the kind of flashy dawn raids the tabloids relish for others. Yet it is beyond dispute that their bosses engaged in a serious high-level cover-up over phone hacking and much else over a long period of time. We learned from ex-Met copper Bob Quick at the Leveson inquiry on Wednesday that bribing coppers for information had been known about at Scotland Yard since at least 2000, though I cannot be alone in having known about it for rather longer. It was just one of those things that reporters from papers which did not flourish a chequebook had to live with. Yet only the other day, Kit Malthouse, Boris Johnson's deputy London mayor, was reported as dismissing the whole Leveson-related investigation as \"media driven hysteria\" which was wasting valuable police resources. He's certainly right about police time, but surely wrong about the implied frivolity of the affair. It's serious and it's about corruption involving major institutions of the state, the police, the media and a cowed political elite. Malthouse sounded like an authentic voice of the quiet-life crowd who don't want the light let in. We also learned on Wednesday that the Tories had frightened off the Met's 2008 inquiry into relations between Damian Green, then the Conservative's immigration spokesman, and Chris Galley, a civil servant who was leaking damaging data about Labour's performance in office. Bob Quick, formerly counter-terrorism chief, felt he was turned over by the Daily Mail and its Sunday sister. He was, though he fell through a mistake of his own: allowing secret papers to be filmed in the street. I read it all rather differently at the time. By all means investigate a politician receiving information which threatened national security \u2013 if that was true \u2013 but politicians have always been leaked information for patriotic reasons (think Churchill and defence readiness in the 1930s). Long may it continue if it can be justified in the public interest. The same defence exists for newspapers, though some have a problem understanding what it means. What the cops did in 2008 was different. They both arrested Green and raided his Westminster office, which struck me as seriously overstepping the constitutional mark that protects MPs going about their lawful business. Admittedly, the Sergeant at Arms, Jill Pay, gave the OK for the raid and the then Speaker, Michael Martin, blamed her. Both were at fault and weightier holders of their offices would have told the boys in blue to pursue their inquiries elsewhere and by other means. Coming so soon after the doomed investigation by Yard troubleshooter John Yates into Tony Blair's alleged loans-for-honours practices, it struck me as the Met's attempt to show it was being even-handed between the political parties, but also to give the politicians another kicking. (Interestingly, Quick said on Wednesday that Yates refused to let his phone records be examined after claims that he was leaking details to pile pressure on the Blair camp.) Remember, we'd just seen Ian Blair, Ken Livingstone's and Tony (no relation) Blair's idea of a modern Met commissioner, forced out by Kit Malthouse's boss, Boris Johnson. Ian Blair championed community policing, which voters like, but he wasn't popular at the Met. One of the issues that has come up at Leveson is claims that senior officers and their press staff briefed against him. It's all coming out now. The Met seems to be saying that it learned these dirty habits \u2013 cosying up to the Murdochs and their kind, briefing against each other via friendly journalists \u2013 from the politicians down the road at Westminster. Well, maybe, but I'm not sure the old Met was either so wholesome or so innocent. The late Sir Robert Mark was brought in to clean it up 40 years ago, a work in progress like painting the Forth Bridge. As for the political class, I seem to recall that they learned to market themselves from the worlds of business and finance, from TV and marketing men in the US like Roger Ailes, who reconstructed Richard Nixon's image in the 60s and later worked for Ronald Reagan. What does Ailes \u2013 72 in May \u2013 do for a living? Bless my soul, he's now president of Rupert Murdoch's pernicious but successful Fox News, the TV channel which is busily misleading millions of Tea Party voters on so many (though not all) issues, not least the vital role of the state in educating and protecting them in a tough world. My working assumption is that the political class \u2013 and, alas, elements within the law and order agencies \u2013 have slowly been bent to the will of the moneyed elite, not least via the media branch of that elite, in the 40 years since the war-hardened generation that made the postwar settlement began fading away and the free-market crowd staged a cyclical revival. It's not cut and dried and the battle goes on in different forms, as it always does. But when I see top taxmen at HMRC cutting private deals on tax bill owed by big corporations I feel as I sometimes do when ministers tell us (because officials have told them) that it's jolly hard to bear down on wealthy non-domiciles who enjoy living here but avoid their share of tax. Many of these issues exist in an acute form in the plutocratic US \u2013 the age of the Victorian robber baron is back \u2013 and so do some of the more visible remedies. Since 2009 the federal authorities in New York have prosecuted 66 people for insider trading, mostly arising from the collapse of Wall St, and got 57 convictions or guilty pleas. The FSA in London has a long way to go. The FBI and the securities and exchange commission, the US version of the soon-to-be-reformed-again FSA, have both a tougher mind-set and the power to tap phones and use the material in court. This is vital in cosy insider trading cases such as the one which convicted the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group, who is now serving 11 years. It's hard to prove a tip led to a lucrative trade for a privileged insider. But it can be done. The FT's John Gapper writes that lack of will is one FSA problem and lack of admissible wire-tap information is another. The FSA has traditionally relied on civil cases and fines, which are modest in terms of profits made. It got its first insider trading conviction in 2009, though there have been a couple of big ones since. White-collar crooks in the US fear the Feds \u2013 Madoff got 150 years in jail \u2013 and they need to do so here. Margaret Hodge's warning, as chair of the Commons public accounts committee that multinational IT firms should no longer see Britain as a soft touch is a start. My sense is that the generation that won the war, the young ex-servicemen and women as well as the leadership, emerged from that exhausting conflict determined to make a better world than was created after 1918. In the welfare state and much else they succeeded. The country was broke and the settlement they made was state-orientated. Everyone felt more entitled, but other economic models were doing better. When Labour failed to rule effectively in the 1970s (so did Ted Heath, under whom Margaret Thatcher served) the stage was set for the free market revival, which has done good things as well as bad. Gradually the old elite lost its nerve and its will to govern, hence the farming out of all sorts of functions to the private sector or to Europe, which was briefly the panacea that would rescue us. It hasn't done so: panaceas never do. But problems are never entirely solved either and \u2013 as with the true cost of another postwar panacea, nuclear power \u2013 it's better to know what they are and see them clearly. That's one vital step to the solution. Touch wood.",

      "body": "<p>I was delighted to see on last night's TV news that Kautilya Pruthi, Britain's answer to the Ponzi fraudster, Bernie Madoff, is facing a stiff jail sentence for stealing more than \u00a3100m from gullible investors to finance an embarrassingly vulgar lifestyle featuring lots of cars, property and swimming pools. The trial ended on Wednesday.</p> <p>Glad too, therefore, to read this week that the Financial Services Authority is prosecuting an ambitious case of insider trading, involving allegations at Southwark crown court that share tips were stolen from the printing operations of two of the City of London's biggest investment banks. It is part of the FSA's drive \u2013 belated, some would say \u2013 to stamp out this sort of conduct. We must wait a while, probably some time, for guilty or innocent verdicts on the seven accused.</p> <p>Either way, these actions deserve a cheer. Why am I so pleased? Because both suggest a willingness by the authorities to enforce the law in ways that are often painfully absent. Contrary to what is often asserted about the power of Britain's political and bureaucratic elite \u2013 my old chum Peter Oborne's ridiculous 2007 book The Triumph of the Political Class is a good example of that \u2013 we usually see a serious loss of nerve and the desire for a quiet life.</p> <p>Has it been getting steadily worse during my lifetime? Or is what we are seeing in terms of cover-ups exposed and demands for greater transparency and accountability \u2013 from City boardrooms to the cabinet table and beyond \u2013 a sign that Britain is getting its act together under the pressures of globalisation and is still a going concern despite its many batterings?</p> <p>Look around you. What is the Leveson inquiry and assorted related police investigations but a belated attempt to stand up to over-mighty media groups (Rupert, I'm talking about you) who thought they were above the law and acted accordingly.</p> <p>The surprise is genuine among some of my News International colleagues that the police should come after them in the kind of flashy dawn raids the tabloids relish for others. Yet it is beyond dispute that their bosses engaged in a serious high-level cover-up over phone hacking and much else over a long period of time.</p> <p>We learned from ex-Met copper Bob Quick <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/mar/07/leveson-inquiry-tory-pressure-damian-green-leak\" title=\"\">at the Leveson inquiry</a> on Wednesday that bribing coppers for information had been known about at Scotland Yard since at least 2000, though I cannot be alone in having known about it for rather longer. It was just one of those things that reporters from papers which did not flourish a chequebook had to live with.</p> <p>Yet only the other day, Kit Malthouse, Boris Johnson's deputy London mayor, was reported as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/mar/05/boris-johnson-deputy-hacking-inquiry\" title=\"\">dismissing the whole Leveson-related investigation</a> as \"media driven hysteria\" which was wasting valuable police resources.

      "bodyText": "A green investment bank intended to attract billions of pounds in funding for new renewables projects will be run from Edinburgh, in a move designed partly to bolster the case against Scottish independence. Vince Cable, the business secretary, announced that the new bank, expected to employ between 50 and 70 people, would have its headquarters in Edinburgh, but will also operate a large fundraising office in London to exploit the City's financial clout and global reach. Cable told the Guardian the two cities had come top of a financial and technical assessment, with Manchester lying third. But he said the side-effect of splitting it between Edinburgh and London supported the \"wider narrative\" of binding Scotland into the UK in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum. He admitted he expected criticism of the decision to split its operations up, and confirmed that London had by far the strongest case of all the 19 cities studied. But, he added, the UK government was also committed to putting major institutions in other parts of the UK to \"rebalance the economy\". \"Edinburgh has a lot going for it, both in terms of it asset management and finance sectors, [and] also its proximity to green energy activity,\" he said. \"I think Manchester came third [during the assessment process] and had Manchester come second, I would've felt obliged to look at Manchester but it didn't. Edinburgh had more to offer.\" Choosing the Scottish capital to strengthen the UK was \"a good argument anyway\" since it supported \"the wider narrative that the UK has a lot going for it\". Suspicions that the decision was partly politically motivated were reinforced after Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, said that sharing its operations between Edinburgh and London underlined the significance and interdependence of the whole UK energy market. As Alex Salmond builds his case for Scottish independence by highlighting Scotland's significant green energy potential, UK ministers have been arguing that independence would harm new investment by undermining the pan-UK energy framework and removing the UK government's crucial public subsidies. Moore said: \"The size and scale of the UK's single energy market ensures the level of investment that will unlock Scotland's renewables future, providing sustainable and affordable green energy across the UK. It makes perfect sense to have a GIB presence there. \"By basing the GIB's corporate HQ, asset management and administrative functions in Edinburgh and its transaction team in London, we can harness expertise across the country to deliver a strong and successful GIB for the UK.\" The first minister has previously insisted that an independent Scotland's energy industry would still be closely integrated with the rest of the UK's, but made no reference to independence or the 2014 referendum in his reaction to the GIB announcement. Salmond, who has played a prominent role in building up overseas investments in green energy, pointed out instead that \u00a3103m of the GIB's start up capital of \u00a33bn came from the money owed to Scotland by the Treasury, which has been sitting on Scotland's share of the fossil fuel levy for some years. He stressed that Scotland had a major role to play for the UK, with the potential to meet 30% of the UK's overall renewables target, if it achieved the Scottish government's target of generating 100% of its electricity from green sources by 2020. \"The decision recognises Scotland's position at the vanguard of the renewables revolution and follows an excellent and professional bid campaign. It is great news for Edinburgh's economy and for Scotland's thriving low carbon sector,\" he said. Green campaigners said the decision on the GIB's location ignored the problems with its powers: it would not have borrowing powers until at least 2015, raising significant issues about its ability to start raising the \u00a3200bn estimated to be needed to hit the UK's CO2 reduction targets. The bank will initially get \u00a3775m towards that \u00a33bn total funding due to come from the Treasury; its key role is to raise up to \u00a315bn in private sector funding, from pension funds, foreign sovereign wealth funds, energy companies and banks, by underwriting the initial losses and risks from new and untested green technologies. Sue Charman, the \"one planet finance leader\" at WWF-UK, said the GIB had an essential role to play in shifting the UK to a low carbon economy, but giving it no immediate borrowing powers was a critical mistake. \"Stepping up investment in renewable energy infrastructure and energy efficiency will be critical to cutting the UK's climate emissions,\" she said. \"The current proposals that the bank won't be able to borrow until 2015 risks hindering urgent and much needed investment in green jobs and technologies and the UK government should reconsider this. \"In addition, linking borrowing power with net debt falling as a percentage of GDP will hamstring the bank's power and calls into question if the Bank really sits at the heart of UK financial and economic policy.\" David Powell, Friends of the Earth's economics campaigner, urged the chancellor, George Osborne, to use this month's budget to allow the bank to borrow immediately. \"Choosing the HQ for the green investment bank has been like arguing about where to put the cherry on a half-baked cake,\" he said. \"This is great news for Edinburgh, but George Osborne's inadequate support means it will start life as a lame duck.\" Cable said the green groups were wrong. He said that the bank's first priority was to find investors for the most difficult, initial start-up costs of new technologies, rather than borrow billions of pounds for projects not yet in planning. \"The question about borrowing powers assumes that there are a vast number of projects out there waiting for funding, and that just isn't the case,\" he said. \"I don't think the green groups appreciate the difficulties in getting new projects off the ground, making them work and being credible.\" Mike Crockart, the Lib Dem MP for Edinburgh West, who played a leading role in the city's campaign to bring the GIB to Scotland against bids from 19 other cities, said that the political element in the decision was exaggerated. He said the campaign for Edinburgh, which was backed by the first minister, all the main parties and other Scottish cities, was based on its technical and academic expertise in green energy technologies, and its large financial and investment sector, which is the second largest in the UK. It had decided to ignore the argument that siting it in Edinburgh would help \"bind Scotland into the union\" in late 2010, Crockart said. The city's campaign \"was quite unashamedly why Edinburgh had the strongest business case, the location of financial services, green technology and research investment going into Scottish universities; that is the case we have been making for 16 months.\" Martin McAdam, chief executive of Aquamarine Power, one of a number of Edinburgh-based marine energy firms, said that choosing the city was \"tremendous news\" for his industry, which has been boosted by a series of green energy investment decisions by major global firms including Mitsubishi, Gamesa and Samsung Heavy Industries. \"The GIB will build on this lead and enable businesses such as Aquamarine Power to leverage the significant private sector capital which will allow the UK's green energy sector to flourish,\" he said.",

It is great news for Edinburgh's economy and for Scotland's thriving low carbon sector,\" he said.</p> <p>Green campaigners said the decision on the GIB's location ignored the problems with its powers: it would not have borrowing powers until at least 2015, raising significant issues about its ability to start raising the \u00a3200bn estimated to be needed to hit the UK's CO2 reduction targets.</p> <p>The bank will initially get \u00a3775m towards that \u00a33bn total funding due to come from the Treasury; its key role is to raise up to \u00a315bn in private sector funding, from pension funds, foreign sovereign wealth funds, energy companies and banks, by underwriting the initial losses and risks from new and untested green technologies.</p> <p>Sue Charman, the \"one planet finance leader\" at WWF-UK, said the GIB had an essential role to play in shifting the UK to a low carbon economy, but giving it no immediate borrowing powers was a critical mistake. \"Stepping up investment in renewable energy infrastructure and energy efficiency will be critical to cutting the UK's climate emissions,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The current proposals that the bank won't be able to borrow until 2015 risks hindering urgent and much needed investment in green jobs and technologies and the UK government should reconsider this.</p> <p>\"In addition, linking borrowing power with net debt falling as a percentage of GDP will hamstring the bank's power and calls into question if the Bank really sits at the heart of UK financial and economic policy.\"</p> <p>David Powell, Friends of the Earth's economics campaigner, urged the chancellor, George Osborne, to use this month's budget to allow the bank to borrow immediately. \"Choosing the HQ for the green investment bank has been like arguing about where to put the cherry on a half-baked cake,\" he said. \"This is great news for Edinburgh, but George Osborne's inadequate support means it will start life as a lame duck.\"</p> <p>Cable said the green groups were wrong. He said that the bank's first priority was to find investors for the most difficult, initial start-up costs of new technologies, rather than borrow billions of pounds for projects not yet in planning. \"The question about borrowing powers assumes that there are a vast number of projects out there waiting for funding, and that just isn't the case,\" he said. \"I don't think the green groups appreciate the difficulties in getting new projects off the ground, making them work and being credible.\"</p> <p>Mike Crockart, the Lib Dem MP for Edinburgh West, who played a leading role in the city's campaign to bring the GIB to Scotland against bids from 19 other cities, said that the political element in the decision was exaggerated.</p> <p>He said the campaign for Edinburgh, which was backed by the first minister, all the main parties and other Scottish cities, was based on its technical and academic expertise in green energy technologies, and its large financial and investment sector, which is the second largest in the UK.</p> <p>It had decided to ignore the argument that siting it in Edinburgh would help \"bind Scotland into the union\" in late 2010, Crockart said.</p> <p>The city's campaign \"was quite unashamedly why Edinburgh had the strongest business case, the location of financial services, green technology and research investment going into Scottish universities; that is the case we have been making for 16 months.\"</p> <p>Martin McAdam, chief executive of Aquamarine Power, one of a number of Edinburgh-based marine energy firms, said that choosing the city was \"tremendous news\" for his industry, which has been boosted by a series of green energy investment decisions by major global firms including Mitsubishi, Gamesa and Samsung Heavy Industries.</p> <p>\"The GIB will build on this lead and enable businesses such as Aquamarine Power to leverage the significant private sector capital which will allow the UK's green energy sector to flourish,\" he said.</p>",

The US state of Nebraska is fighting to be allowed to carry out an execution using drugs manufactured in India, which the manufacturer believed were bound for sub-Saharan Africa for legitimate medical use. When this grim event takes place it will be the first execution in Nebraska since 1997, and the first ever in the state by lethal injection. You'd think the Nebraska department of correctional services (NDCS) would be anxious to see all go smoothly. That they'd leave no room for error, no reason to query their new execution procedure. Not so. NDCS's blundering attempts to procure execution drugs over the past 12 months have drawn criticism from the courts, sanctions by the drugs enforcement agency (DEA), public opprobrium and ridicule from the press. It would be farcical were it not so tragic. It's not just the condemned man's fate that is on the line: the pharmaceutical manufacturer Naari is in despair. The company is named by NDCS as the manufacturer of the drugs intended for the execution of Michael Ryan. This despite the fact that Naari has never had any dealings with NDCS, is vehemently opposed to the use of its drugs in executions, and isn't even licensed to sell drugs in the US. Putting his faith in the US justice system, Naari's CEO wrote to chief justice Heavican of Nebraska supreme court. The drugs were never intended to go to the US, he explained. They were intended for registration in Zambia, where, unlike in the US, there is legitimate medical need for the drugs. NDCS had acquired Naari's drugs through a middleman, who had, the company argues, taken them under false pretences, and the drugs should be returned. The justice system refused to listen. In fact, Naari was asked to \"please refrain from sending any further communications regarding this matter to Nebraska supreme court given that such ex parte communications are generally improper\". The US food and drug administration (FDA) has not approved or tested the drugs that will be used in Ryan's execution. It has not verified the ingredients, has not checked the site of manufacture, has not reviewed the chain of custody, and will not comment on the \"identity, safety, effectiveness, purity, or any other characteristics\" of the shipment. It's a shocking abdication of the FDA's responsibilities, and the consequences could be very grave indeed. If the drugs don't work effectively, the execution will be torturous, as the supreme court of America has itself acknowledged: \"It is uncontested that, failing a proper dose of sodium thiopental that would render the prisoner unconscious, there is a substantial \u2026 risk of suffocation \u2026 and pain from the injection.\" Executions make headlines; botched executions, front-page stories. The Indian pharmaceutical industry has only recently recovered from the counterfeit drug scandals that marred its reputation through the 80s and 90s. The last thing it needs is more negative headlines. And why should the Indian pharmaceutical industry be forced to play henchman to the US executioner? On a recent trip to India, the question I was asked most often was why the US can't just make their own execution drugs. The answer is telling. They can, but they don't want to. US manufacturers have done the math: profits from execution drug sales are minimal (roughly $100 in total per year); costs to reputations, incalculable. So the US prisons turn to India to exploit an open market and potentially destroy the reputation and livelihood of the companies unfortunate enough to be dragged into the trade. A great injustice is being done, and the US law enforcement agencies are allowing it to happen. Nebraska's execution will indeed be a historic moment. It will mark a new low in the US's blinkered pursuit of capital punishment. A moment we should all look upon with shame. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

The offer from Transport for London (TfL) comes after the RMT union declared a formal dispute with London Underground over the question of Olympic payments. The RMT, which represents about 10,000 of London Underground's 18,000 workers, had already rejected a previous offer worth up to \u00a3500. \"Clearly, moving from offering nothing to the latest offer of \u00a3850 is a massive shift on the part of London Underground,\" RMT general secretary Bob Crow told the Press Association. \"The offer will now be considered by our reps and by the full executive before we make a formal response.\" The offer follows talks at conciliation service Acas between the RMT, which has always insisted it wanted to reach a settlement, and London Underground. It comprises a a \u00a3350 flat-rate payment, which a TfL spokesman said \"acknowledges the inconvenience of working antisocial hours and locations\", a \u00a320 bonus per shift worked, and a \u00a3100 element conditional on customer satisfaction targets being met. Last year the union agreed a four-year pay increase which took tube drivers' salaries above \u00a350,000 for a 35-hour week including eight weeks' holiday. The RMT has already struck several deals with rail companies for extra pay during the Olympics, including a \u00a3500 flat-rate bonus for Virgin Trains and Network Rail staff, \u00a3600 for London Overground workers, and a \u00a3900 flat-rate bonus for Docklands Light Railway staff plus enhanced overtime, which officials said could be worth up to \u00a32,500. It is still balloting hundreds of TfL workers about proposals to severely restrict annual leave during the Olympics, claiming they would make life \"impossible\" for many staff, especially those with school-age children. The RMT is also balloting some maintenance workers for industrial action in a dispute over pensions and travel passes. It said it wanted employees at maintenance business Tube Lines, now a subsidiary of TfL, to be able to join the company's pension scheme and receive the same travel concessions as other staff. London Underground's chief operating officer, Howard Collins, told PA: \"We have had productive discussions with the unions this week and put forward our proposals about how we can fairly reward staff. \"We have put forward an offer which would see station, maintenance, service control staff and operational managers receive up to \u00a3850 for working flexibly during the 2012 London Games, subject to attendance, customer satisfaction scores and agreement from operational staff to work flexibly in order to deliver a successful Games. \"In return we are asking staff to work longer hours at different times of the day, to be prepared to work extra hours and to be more flexible in how and where they carry out their role for us during these crucial weeks. We know our employees want to play their part in delivering a great games for London, so reaching agreement on this will allow all of us to focus on that exciting challenge together.\" Lee Jones, operations director for Tube Lines, said: \"We have been discussing this issue with our trade unions for some time, and we will continue to try to find a way forward through constructive discussion. We would urge the RMT to withdraw its threat of a strike ballot, which will not achieve anything.\"",

      "bodyText": "The number of people officially classed as homeless in England has jumped by 14% \u2013 the biggest increase for nine years \u2013 as what charities have described as a \"perfect storm\" of rising repossession rates and unemployment drives thousands more families into temporary accommodation. Across England, 48,510 households were accepted as homeless by local authorities in 2011, according to figures published by the Department for Communities and Local Government on Thursday. The data shows 69,460 children or expected children are in homeless households, with three-quarters of the households accepted containing children. Homelessness had been going down since 2003, with a small increase in 2010, and the scale of this rise has shocked housing campaigners. Leslie Morphy, the chief executive of Crisis, said: \"Our worst fears are coming to pass. We face a perfect storm of economic downturn, rising joblessness and soaring demand for limited affordable housing combined with government policy to cut housing benefit plus local cuts to homelessness services.\" But the housing minister, Grant Shapps, said the figures were still half the average rate seen under Labour and blamed \"the debt-laden economy we inherited [which] is leaving a legacy of hard-up households across the country\". He said the government had made an extra \u00a370m available to councils in the past year to assist households facing the prospect of homelessness. The figures show a 44% increase in households who are homeless after repossession, with the number rising to 1,520. But this is still a relatively small part of the whole picture, and the biggest proportion \u2013 20% \u2013 are those who can no longer stay with a friend or a relative. In the last three months of 2011, 12,830 households were accepted as homeless, up 18% on the same period the previous year. \"These figures are a shocking reminder of the divide between the housing haves and have nots in this country,\" Campbell Robb, the chief executive of Shelter, said. \"Amid growing economic gloom and rising unemployment, increasing numbers of ordinary families are falling victim to our housing crisis. Some may be priced out of the housing market, forced to bring up their families in a revolving door of private let after private let.\" The figures come days after official statistics showed the number of rough sleepers in England had gone up by one-fifth. The statistics show households that local authorities have recognised are unintentionally homeless and have accepted a duty to house. Increasingly, people are being put up in bed and breakfast accommodation, with the use of this arrangement up 37% on the previous year after years of decline. Councils are not encouraged to place families in B&amp;Bs, and there is a six-week time limit. Shelter says the increased use is a sign of the shortage of suitable accommodation as the figures also show a decrease in the use of accommodation leased by the private sector to local authorities, by 6% from 27,730 to 26,080 households, so B&amp;B will often be the only option. In fact, 8,540 households are homeless because their short lease came to an end, up 39% on 2010. Under the new Localism Act, councils will be able to discharge homeless households into the private rented sector against their will by offering them temporary accommodation rather than finding them a settled home. The shadow housing minister, Jack Dromey, said the rise was \"inevitable\". \"The remorseless rise in homelessness shows how out of touch this government is with the human impact of its economic and housing policies. It is an absolute tragedy that in 2012 so many families do not have a home they can call their own.\" Birmingham has the highest number of homeless people, with 925 households, but the highest rate in England is in Waltham Forest, north-east London, where 2.55 households per 1,000 were accepted as homeless in the last three months of 2011, compared to an England figure of 0.59. Across London, homelessness is up by 27.4%. The full force of the housing benefit cuts \u2013 which come in for a million existing claimants from 1 January \u2013 is yet to be felt. However, housing campaigners say the cuts may be reflected in the figures because some landlords will be terminating contracts and taking the decision not to renew tenancies in anticipation.",

We face a perfect storm of economic downturn, rising joblessness and soaring demand for limited affordable housing combined with government policy to cut housing benefit plus local cuts to homelessness services.\"</p> <p>But the housing minister, Grant Shapps, said the figures were still half the average rate seen under Labour and blamed \"the debt-laden economy we inherited [which] is leaving a legacy of hard-up households across the country\".</p> <p>He said the government had made an extra \u00a370m available to councils in the past year to assist households facing the prospect of homelessness.</p> <p>The figures show a 44% increase in households who are homeless after repossession, with the number rising to 1,520. But this is still a relatively small part of the whole picture, and the biggest proportion \u2013 20% \u2013 are those who can no longer stay with a friend or a relative.</p> <p>In the last three months of 2011, 12,830 households were accepted as homeless, up 18% on the same period the previous year.</p> <p>\"These figures are a shocking reminder of the divide between the housing haves and have nots in this country,\" Campbell Robb, the chief executive of Shelter, said.</p> <p>\"Amid growing economic gloom and rising unemployment, increasing numbers of ordinary families are falling victim to our housing crisis. Some may be priced out of the housing market, forced to bring up their families in a revolving door of private let after private let.\"</p> <p>The figures come days after official statistics showed the number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/23/number-rough-sleepers-rises-fifth\" title=\"\">rough sleepers in England had gone up by one-fifth</a>.</p> <p>The statistics show households that local authorities have recognised are unintentionally homeless and have accepted a duty to house. Increasingly, people are being put up in bed and breakfast accommodation, with the use of this arrangement up 37% on the previous year after years of decline.</p> <p>Councils are not encouraged to place families in B&amp;Bs, and there is a six-week time limit.</p> <p>Shelter says the increased use is a sign of the shortage of suitable accommodation as the figures also show a decrease in the use of accommodation leased by the private sector to local authorities, by 6% from 27,730 to 26,080 households, so B&amp;B will often be the only option.</p> <p>In fact, 8,540 households are homeless because their short lease came to an end, up 39% on 2010. Under the new <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Localism Act</a>, councils will be able to discharge homeless households into the private rented sector against their will by offering them temporary accommodation rather than finding them a settled home.</p> <p>The shadow housing minister, Jack Dromey, said the rise was \"inevitable\".</p> <p>\"The remorseless rise in homelessness shows how out of touch this government is with the human impact of its economic and housing policies.

The government yesterday announced the closure of two in three of the remaining Remploy factories for disabled workers, with the loss of more than 1,700 jobs. As David Brindle points out in his story on the announcement, most disability charities back the move, saying that the sheltered factory model is long outdated. But the shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, said the move was \"the wrong plan at the wrong time\" and has asked the government to answer 10 questions on the factories and their workers. On Twitter, Mark Brown of One in Four magazine also poses an interesting question: How about each threatened #remploy factory looking at becoming #dpulo (disabled people's user led org) #socent ? Do you think it might work? \u2022 Haringey, the inside story. Peter Lewis, who replaced Sharon Shoesmith as Haringey's director of children's services in the wake of the Baby P case, writes for Children &amp; Young People Now about his three years in post. When I got to Haringey I discovered what we all might have expected; many, many dozens of highly professional, committed social workers and other staff who had continued to come to work to take care of our most vulnerable children and families. Whatever had happened when things went wrong, some people were still getting it right and doing a good job. Equally, there were some workers whose skills were frankly not going to make the difference we needed. They were not necessarily bad people; just out of their depth. They needed to go, and go quickly. That, of itself, would create further short-term challenges while we recruited workers of the right calibre \u2013 not just social care staff but also child health workers, who were just as closely tied up in this work as anyone else. Together with Eleanor Brazil and Mark Gurrey, who had joined us as deputy directors for social care, and Jane Elias, the partnership director of operations at Great Ormond Street Hospital, we managed to get the right team in place. Recruitment was indeed one of the toughest challenges. At the beginning, more than 45 per cent of social workers in critical areas were agency staff. Permanent managers were as rare as hen's teeth. We had to change that \u2013 but how? It became almost a war of attrition. Agency staff seemed to be paid more and had more advantageous working conditions. \u2022 NHS reforms. Patrick Butler is hosting the NHS reforms live blog today, as the House of Lords debates amendments around the regulation of private patient income earned by NHS trusts; and Healthwatch, the proposed \"national consumer champion\" body which will represent patients' views of health services. \u2022 The Guardian/Mixmag drug survey, launched last year. Mixmag has been running its survey, said to be where the world's policymakers turn for accurate information, for the last decade. For the first time, the Guardian has joined forces with the magazine to help produce what we hope will be the biggest, most comprehensive survey of its kind in the world.

This quote from Beth Breeze of the centre for philanthropy, humanitarianism and social justice at the University of Kent, caught my eye. Following US investor Warren Buffett's suggestion that very rich people \"should leave their children enough money so that they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing\", Breeze says: Paris Hilton has done a great deal for philanthropy in recent years.

The government yesterday <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/mar/07/remploy-factory-closures-disabled-workers\">announced the closure of two in three of the remaining Remploy factories</a> for disabled workers, with the loss of more than 1,700 jobs. As David Brindle points out in his story on the announcement, most disability charities back the move, saying that the sheltered factory model is long outdated. But the shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, said the move was \"the wrong plan at the wrong time\" and has <a href=\"http://liambyrne.co.uk/?p=3337\">asked the government to answer 10 questions</a> on the factories and their workers. On Twitter, Mark Brown of One in Four magazine also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/markoneinfour/status/177493159964717056\">poses an interesting question</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How about each threatened #remploy factory looking at becoming #dpulo (disabled people's user led org) #socent ?

Whatever had happened when things went wrong, some people were still getting it right and doing a good job.<br>Equally, there were some workers whose skills were frankly not going to make the difference we needed. They were not necessarily bad people; just out of their depth.<br>They needed to go, and go quickly. That, of itself, would create further short-term challenges while we recruited workers of the right calibre \u2013 not just social care staff but also child health workers, who were just as closely tied up in this work as anyone else. Together with Eleanor Brazil and Mark Gurrey, who had joined us as deputy directors for social care, and Jane Elias, the partnership director of operations at Great Ormond Street Hospital, we managed to get the right team in place.<br>Recruitment was indeed one of the toughest challenges. At the beginning, more than 45 per cent of social workers in critical areas were agency staff. Permanent managers were as rare as hen's teeth. We had to change that \u2013 but how? It became almost a war of attrition. Agency staff seemed to be paid more and had more advantageous working conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong>NHS reforms</strong>.

      "bodyText": "The very first line of standup comic Sarah Millican's new TV show tonight is a joke about her weight. That's how keen she and the BBC are to assert her one-of-us credentials. In the four years since she seized the standup world's attention with an Edinburgh Best Newcomer award, Millican has been in headlong retreat from novelty and towards the unthreatening familiarity of gags about eating, sex and bodily functions. Her new BBC2 vehicle puts the seal on her entry into the mainstream big league, for which the excellence of her joke-telling, but also her unadventurous patter, render Millican perfectly qualified. I've seen Millican perform live on three or four occasions \u2013 not including her gigs on the Edinburgh Fringe last year, to which I was told I wasn't welcome. Presumably that's because I'd written in the past that her shows, while amusing, were becoming more formulaic with each passing year. Her debut was her most exciting show \u2013 partly because hers was a new and very funny voice, but mainly because it was about her recent divorce, and came from the heart. That show established her as an \"authentic\", un-styled performer \u2013 aged 33, with a hinterland of real-world experiences of the type that most of us share. Her subsequent career has turned that into a shtick, as Millican exaggerates and celebrates her own plainness, laziness and greed. She is, the message strains to say, just like us \u2013 which is why her recent peevish altercation with an audience member whom she accused of filming her gig was damaging to the Millican brand. In the TV show, she's back to being unpretentious Sarah, cracking about how Newsnight sends her to sleep, seeking relationship advice from her dad in a self-indulgent Skype link-up, and taking a clumsy flirting masterclass from a visiting \"sexpert\". The Sarah Millican Television Programme as a chatshow, brings to mind Parky's comments last month about \"intellectual downgrading to the third division south\". Insofar as it's a comedy show, it amply showcases Millican's talents and her popular touch. There are some bulletproof gags about TV nature programmes, and, even if the flirting routine is crude, Millican's clowning is easy to enjoy. But it's not sophisticated. I find myself longing for Millican, on telly as on stage, to apply her obvious comic intelligence to something other than sex and self-mockery. Even when (in tonight's show) she talks wild animals, it devolves into a Q&amp;A with the crowd about which beast they'd most like to shag. Millican's oblique resemblance to Mrs Merton draws attention to the lack of edge or satirical intent here. It's on BBC2, but there's nothing alternative about Millican. Her appeal to some, and lack of appeal to others, is that she's as mainstream as the Generation Game. \u2022 The Sarah Millican Television Programme: Thursdays, 10pm, BBC2",

      "bodyText": "Formula One, surely the most intensely competitive of all sports because of the heavily funded arms race that propels it, will not just be about the battle between Red Bull, McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes this year. It also sees Sky squaring up against the BBC as F1 gets more TV coverage than ever before. There were two functions this week which told you something about the resources of the respective broadcasters. There was coffee and cakes at the Beeb's HQ in Portland Place and, in a swish West End restaurant, lobster cocktail and fillet of beef washed down by Chablis and Rioja, courtesy of Sky Sports. Many race fans, brought up on free-to-air coverage, were upset when the satellite broadcaster bought the rights to show all 20 races live in 2012. But there will be all sorts of toys to blow the minds of the anoraks. \"We think the interactive service will reinvent interactive television,\" says Martin Turner, the very enthusiastic executive producer of Sky Sports F1. Viewers with Sky race control will be able to choose between as many as nine simultaneous content streams, including a live pit channel. We will see the cars explained using 3D graphics to pull out wings and exhaust systems in a virtual car feature and cameras will go behind the scenes to make stars of the pit crews. Mercedes get the full treatment when Sky Sports F1 HD channel launches tomorrow at 8pm. But the more traditional BBC, which will cover 10 races live, including such key events as Silverstone, Monaco, Spa and Brazil, with highlights packages for the other races, can be relied upon to be as excellent as ever. The team is still led by the impressively versatile Jake Humphrey while Ben Edwards has been brought in as lead commentator, replacing Martin Brundle, who has skipped to Sky. No other sport is as fortunate as this. Formula One has been brilliantly served by the TV studios \u2013 coverage on ITV, too, was impressive, though the ads did have a nasty habit of butting in at crucial moments. If you have Sky, and you want to get in the mood for the new season, you must also watch Senna on Friday on Sky Premiere (10pm). And if you've already seen it watch it again. Asif Kapadia's Bafta winner didn't even get a nomination for an Oscar (which shows how seriously they take Formula One in the US) but it's an utterly absorbing portrait of the three-times world champion, who must be one of the two or three greatest drivers of them all, perhaps the greatest. It's a memorable documentary, charting the the controversial and deeply spiritual driver's many clashes with Alain Prost. If I could make a Formula One film I would go back even further and tell the story of Achille Varzi, the remarkable Italian driver of the 1930s, who was the great Tazio Nuvolari's fiercest foe. His story \u2013 which I read in Nigel Roebuck's 1986 classic Grand Prix Greats \u2013 is astonishingly cinematic. And just as Senna admired Fangio, Fangio's hero was Varzi. \"Varzi was, to me, a god,\" said Fangio. \"He spoke with great simplicity and gave me precious advice. He is probably the driver I have most admired in my life, a man who cared only for his art.\" There is a lovely story about the 1930 Mille Miglia, the old endurance road race. Varzi and Nuvolari had challenged each other and said that whoever won this race would be recognised as the better driver. In the closing stages no other car was within half an hour of these two. Then Varzi saw the lights of Vuvolari's car in his mirrors. When the lights disappeared, Varzi thought he had his man beaten, but Nuvolari had merely doused them and been following Varzi through the mountains before passing him. The handsome and notorious womaniser Varzi had an affair with Ilse, the beautiful wife of a rival driver, which ruined him. Ilse introduced him to morphine and he became addicted and lost all his great skills. He disappeared before being traced to a villa near Rome existing on a diet of cigarettes, champagne and coffee.

      "body": "<p>Formula One, surely the most intensely competitive of all sports because of the heavily funded arms race that propels it, will not just be about the battle between Red Bull, McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes this year.</p> <p>It also sees Sky squaring up against the BBC as F1 gets more TV coverage than ever before. There were two functions this week which told you something about the resources of the respective broadcasters.</p> <p>There was coffee and cakes at the Beeb's HQ in Portland Place and, in a swish West End restaurant, lobster cocktail and fillet of beef washed down by Chablis and Rioja, courtesy of Sky Sports.</p> <p>Many race fans, brought up on free-to-air coverage, were upset when the satellite broadcaster bought the rights to show all 20 races live in 2012. But there will be all sorts of toys to blow the minds of the anoraks.</p> <p>\"We think the interactive service will reinvent interactive television,\" says Martin Turner, the very enthusiastic executive producer of Sky Sports F1. Viewers with Sky race control will be able to choose between as many as nine simultaneous content streams, including a live pit channel.</p> <p>We will see the cars explained using 3D graphics to pull out wings and exhaust systems in a virtual car feature and cameras will go behind the scenes to make stars of the pit crews. Mercedes get the full treatment when Sky Sports F1 HD channel launches tomorrow at 8pm.</p> <p>But the more traditional BBC, which will cover 10 races live, including such key events as Silverstone, Monaco, Spa and Brazil, with highlights packages for the other races, can be relied upon to be as excellent as ever.</p> <p>The team is still led by the impressively versatile Jake Humphrey while Ben Edwards has been brought in as lead commentator, replacing Martin Brundle, who has skipped to Sky.</p> <p>No other sport is as fortunate as this. Formula One has been brilliantly served by the TV studios \u2013 coverage on ITV, too, was impressive, though the ads did have a nasty habit of butting in at crucial moments.</p> <p>If you have Sky, and you want to get in the mood for the new season, you must also watch Senna on Friday on Sky Premiere (10pm). And if you've already seen it watch it again.</p> <p>Asif Kapadia's Bafta winner didn't even get a nomination for an Oscar (which shows how seriously they take Formula One in the US) but it's an utterly absorbing portrait of the three-times world champion, who must be one of the two or three greatest drivers of them all, perhaps <em>the</em> greatest.</p> <p>It's a memorable documentary, charting the the controversial and deeply spiritual driver's many clashes with Alain Prost.</p> <p>If I could make a Formula One film I would go back even further and tell the story of Achille Varzi, the remarkable Italian driver of the 1930s, who was the great Tazio Nuvolari's fiercest foe.</p> <p>His story \u2013 which I read in Nigel Roebuck's 1986 classic Grand Prix Greats \u2013 is astonishingly cinematic. And just as Senna admired Fangio, Fangio's hero was Varzi. \"Varzi was, to me, a god,\" said Fangio. \"He spoke with great simplicity and gave me precious advice. He is probably the driver I have most admired in my life, a man who cared only for his art.\"</p> <p>There is a lovely story about the 1930 Mille Miglia, the old endurance road race. Varzi and Nuvolari had challenged each other and said that whoever won this race would be recognised as the better driver.</p> <p>In the closing stages no other car was within half an hour of these two. Then Varzi saw the lights of Vuvolari's car in his mirrors. When the lights disappeared, Varzi thought he had his man beaten, but Nuvolari had merely doused them and been following Varzi through the mountains before passing him.</p> <p>The handsome and notorious womaniser Varzi had an affair with Ilse, the beautiful wife of a rival driver, which ruined him. Ilse introduced him to morphine and he became addicted and lost all his great skills. He disappeared before being traced to a villa near Rome existing on a diet of cigarettes, champagne and coffee. He was only 32 but looked old and destroyed.</p> <p>Then, when racing resumed again after the war, he returned, mysteriously, from nowhere, cured from his illness and as brilliant as ever, dominating with Alfa Romeo until, in 1948, he was thrown from his car and, wearing just his usual linen helmet, was killed immediately.</p> <p>The story's got everything, sex, drugs, betrayal, danger and death \u2013 all at high speed. Even Sky Sports can't make today's drivers look that interesting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I came to this country from war-torn Lebanon 25 years ago. I was so glad to be somewhere safe, but I was taken aback by some of the hostility I met from British people. I remember very clearly how one elderly woman who lived near to us would send her dog after me when I passed her house as I walked my children to school. She would also stop me at the local shop and pour out her anger at me. Back then, I could not speak English, nor could I understand her behaviour towards me, especially as we did not know each other at all. I started working with migrants in a community centre, and I realised that my experiences \u2013 which I had assumed were isolated \u2013 were shared by others. Asylum seekers seemed to be coming in for much of the hostility. I remember one asylum seeker telling me that while he was living in accommodation provided by the Home Office, which was clearly known in the neighbourhood as a hostel for refugees, people used to throw bottles and stones at him as he came and went. When he was evicted from the hostel after failing in his asylum claim he became homeless, but he told me that in a way it was easier sleeping on the streets. After a while we got some support to set up a group to discuss the role of the media in driving this hostility. One of the migrants who came to the first meeting told me, \"When I hear the negative news about us, I get angry. But what can we do? I just go home and shut my door, feeling upset and helpless.\" There was enormous demand among migrants and refugees to open the door at last and try to work with journalists and broadcasters. Our sense of urgency was sharpened at the last election, when we were very concerned about the way the immigration debate was going. We knew that lots of claims would be made against migrants and refugees, and would be rarely challenged. Everyone was talking about migrants - except migrants themselves. I could no longer afford to sit back and watch in horror. I had to do something to stop the situation from deteriorating further. So I set up Migrant Voice to mobilise and engage migrants with the media, the public and in the debate on migration. It was up to us now to initiate the missing dialogue. We produced the Migrant Voice newspaper so we could tell our own stories and reach out to the public and start a conversation with them. I feel that this new award, the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year award, which in this first year is celebrating the work that migrants and refugee women do at the grassroots in London, will help us in this conversation. It will help us to show that we also want to contribute to building a more tolerant and decent society. I know that this is possible. One Christmas, the elderly woman who had been setting her dog on me came up to ask my forgiveness. So I know that change can happen, whether in an individual or in a country. One of our members once said to me: \"How can they hate us so much when they don't even know us?\" \"You have answered your question; because they don't know us, and it is up to us to tell them who we are,\" I told her. \u2022 Nazek Ramadan is the director of Migrant Voice.

It may have been made by Doxa SA, which was founded in 1889 in Switzerland. They manufactured boutique brand watches under different names, eg Helson, Benarus, Walco etc. A clue to the age of your watch is the second Arabic hour band numbered from 13 to 24. Such watches were made during and after the first and second world wars; the Art Deco style suggests a date closer to the first world war. The value is mostly in its gold case.

In the past 48 hours, Kony 2012 has been viewed more than 21m times on YouTube and 11m times on Vimeo. According to YouTube statistics, the Kony video is most popular with young women aged 13 to 17 and men aged 18 to 24. The 30-minute film has been viewed right across the globe and has racked up the most views in the US, China and Australia. However, official YouTube figures show that the video has hardly received any views from internet users in Chad, the Central African Republic, Congo or Morocco. \"This is very unusual, to see something be this popular at that length in that short period of time,\" said Christian d'Ippolito, group head of international sales at viral video experts Unruly Media. The hugely popular film is not a typical internet success story. It is a world away from slapstick clips involving cute babies and cats, as it documents alleged atrocities by Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, and accuses the tyrant of turning African children into child slaves during years of abuse. Its rapid rise to prominence has eclipsed other notable viral videos such as Fenton the dog, which racked up 5m views in three months last autumn, and the Double Rainbow video, undiscovered for a month before it was propelled to global fame in 2010. \"This is the key: YouTube is littered with a whole range of different video content \u2013 from lolcats to fails. It's refreshing to see something that has at its core something that has a real strong message and it shows where the internet is moving,\" said D'Ippolito. \"It's not about the short sharp clips anymore. Now you're seeing content designed to trigger a whole range of different emotions. It's definitely hit its target of generating mass awareness.\"",

      "bodyText": "I can't say it surprises me to discover that nearly 40% of us, although suspicious that we may have the symptoms of cancer, put off going to the doctor because we're afraid of what we may find. In the days when the mere word \"cancer\" was considered absolutely taboo and you whispered \"the C word\" behind an embarrassed and terrified hand, my own mother would mutter darkly about friends who'd found lumps in places considered too private to be mentioned \u2013 and had decided they wouldn't do anything about it because they didn't want to be officially delivered a death sentence. \"I wouldn't do it myself,\" she would say. \"I don't want them cutting bits off me and giving me horrible medicine. I'd rather be dead.\" My father must have absorbed her thinking along with the marvellous meals she cooked for him. A mere five months after her death from Parkinson's disease he succumbed to a fierce, undiagnosed illness. From being an energetic husband of 79 who had cared unstintingly for his sick wife he became bedridden in the space of a few days. He was rushed to hospital, told he had advanced lung cancer, that it was too late for treatment and, a mere two weeks later, died in our local hospice. He must have known what was going on and had often dismissed my concerns about him seeming over-tired or developing a husky voice, but he would not go to the doctor. My own delay was not from fear, but the result of being too busy to be over concerned about my health. I received the letter calling me for a routine mammogram. I had no symptoms at the time, although I knew I was in a high -risk category for breast cancer. I was 55. I had taken combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT \u2013 known to be a significant risk factor for the wretched disease. I was overweight and had fallen into the dangerous trap of treating dry white wine as a non-alcoholic drink, all adding to the likelihood of my falling prey to its destructive tentacles. Nevertheless, I noticed the date of my appointment was inconvenient and, instead of making an instant phone call to change it, I popped the letter on the pile of papers I laughingly call my filing system and promptly forgot about it. Nearly a year later, standing in the shower, I noticed an inverted nipple \u2013 a classic sign of the disease. My partner confirmed there was something odd and stood over me insistently as I rang the GP for an appointment. A mammogram confirmed the diagnosis and, let me assure you, there are few things in life more terrifying than being told, yes, you have cancer and because of the size of the tumour you will need a mastectomy \u2013 the most radical form of surgery for this type of tumour. It was clear that, had I taken the trouble to rearrange the mammogram I would probably have got away with a lumpectomy and might not have needed chemotherapy. The fact is that a diagnosis of cancer no longer necessarily means a death sentence, as treatments for most of the common cancers have come on in leaps and bounds in recent years. And, of course, the earlier the detection, the more likely the cancer will not have begun to go walkabout to other parts of the body and the greater the chance that any treatment will be successful. This tendency to delay is not confined to the old and middle-aged. A couple of weeks ago I met a young woman of 21 who had pains in the lower part of her abdomen at the age of 18. She went to the GP. She had a scan. There was a mass. She was referred for a biopsy to find out whether or not it was malignant. She put off her appointments time and time again because she was frightened of being told she had cancer. There is no doubt the surgery to her bladder would have been less invasive had she dealt with it at the beginning. As it was, she didn't know what her long-term future might be and was kicking herself for not having the sense to get it sorted out straight away. Interestingly, she said she felt greatly relieved finally to know what she was dealing with and was resigned to whatever drug treatment her oncologist might prescribe. Which is what I found. I didn't want to die. I took the treatment on the chin. It wasn't pleasant \u2013 in fact, it was bloody awful \u2013 but five years on I'm still here. Go on, if you have a suspicion, get it checked out. You know it makes sense. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "The number of new nuclear power stations entering the construction phase fell dramatically last year compared with previous years, in the aftermath of the incident at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan last March. From 2008 to 2010, construction work began on 38 reactors around the world, but in 2011-12, there were only two construction starts, according to Steve Thomas, professor of energy studies at the University of Greenwich. The fall was interpreted by some as evidence of rapidly waning interest in nuclear power after the forced shutdown of the Fukushima reactor a year ago, in which no one was killed but thousands of people were forced to flee their homes. But others argued it was merely a temporary pause, and predicted the \"nuclear renaissance\" would continue. Rebecca Harms, president of the Greens/EFA group in the European parliament, called on countries to abandon their nuclear ambitions, saying Fukushima had shown that the safety of reactors could not be guaranteed. \"We failed to learn the lessons of Chernobyl \u2013 otherwise Fukushima would not have happened,\" she told a small demonstration outside the European parliament in Brussels. The former governor of Fukushima prefecture, Eisaku Sato, repeated her call: \"We are living with the evacuation. We believe there should be no more people like us.\" In Europe, Germany has vowed to phase out atomic plants and Italy and Switzerland have also voted against nuclear energy, while public opinion in some other countries is uncertain. Jo Leinen MEP told an audience at the Friends of Europe group in Brussels: \"A nuclear renaissance in Europe? I can't see it.\" But Connie Hedegaard, Europe's climate chief, said nuclear power would continue to be part of the European and world energy mix for years. \"The reality will be that it will still play a part,\" she said. \"It will probably not grow as much as people thought it would before Fukushima. Many countries will still move forward [with nuclear plans] but with an increased focus on security.\" Christoph Frei, secretary general of the World Energy Council, told the Guardian that his organisation's research showed there was still a need for and interest in nuclear power around the world, with many countries including the UK intending to push forward with plans for new plants. \"The nuclear renaissance is continuing,\" he said. The true lesson of Fukushima, according to Patrick Moore, honorary chairman of Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy Canada, was not of nuclear risk but of nuclear safety, as there had been no fatalities and appeared to be no long-term damage. He said: \"There is no good reason to be afraid of nuclear power. It is not harming anyone and it did not harm anyone in Fukushima.\" Before the Fukushima incident, nuclear power generators had been enjoying a return to favour in many parts of the world. The Chernobyl accident in 1987 chilled investment in nuclear around the world for well over a decade, but in recent years that changed \u2013 as countries began to engage with the problem of climate change, and as rapidly developing economies sought ways to satisfy their hunger for energy, the technology came under serious consideration again. Many dozens of new reactors were planned, and the nuclear industry rebranded itself as an environmentally friendly technology, arguing that as reactors do not produce carbon dioxide they should be seen as part of the solution to climate change, and could provide back-up to intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar power. After Fukushima, the shockwaves were also felt beyond phase-outs by European governments. Kuwait pulled out last month of a contract to build four reactors, Venezuelan froze all nuclear development projects and Mexico dropped plans to build 10 reactors. \"Fukushima was like the spark that lit the debate,\" said Tobias M\u00fcnchmeyer of Greenpeace in Germany. \"The shocked German public forced Chancellor Merkel either to phase out nuclear or to phase out herself. When the government took eight reactors offline it was surprising to some people that we did not have blackouts or price spikes. It cost a bit, but it also stimulated growth in renewable [energy] and we now have 300,000 jobs in renewables compared to 30,000 in nuclear.\" Moore claimed, however, that Germany was already in the process of building 13GW of fossil fuel power stations and was making plans for 10GW more \u2013 altogether, as much power as is generated from 23 reactors \u2013 in order to make up for the shortfall in nuclear energy. Protests against proposed plants already under construction have intensified in India, which plans to quadruple nuclear capacity by 2020 and triple it again to generate 25% of its electricity by 2030. Mass protests and hunger strikes by social movements led to deaths, injuries and riots in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Jaitapur. Construction of two plants in Tamil Nadu was delayed and West Bengal dropped plans for six Russian reactors following protests. Last month India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, blamed US and German groups for whipping up protests. \"We have been carrying out hunger strikes, rallies, public meetings, seminars, conferences, and other demonstrations such as shaving our heads, cooking on the street, burning the models of the nuclear plants. This struggle has been going on for the past 197 days and the morale of the people is still very very high,\" said S P Udayakumar, co-ordinator of the People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy. \"This is a classic David-Goliath fight between the 'ordinary citizens' of India and the Indian government supported by the multinational companies, imperial powers and the global nuclear mafia. They promise nuclear power, development, atom bombs, security and superpower status. We demand risk-free electricity, disease-free life, unpolluted natural resources, sustainable development and a harmless future,\" he said. China's stance on nuclear is being keenly watched. Before Fukushima, the Chinese government had plans to add 40GW of nuclear by 2020. But construction plans in several provinces were plagued with protests about safety and lack of consultation. Jiang Kejun, a director of the Energy Research Institute in Beijing, said: \"Globally, I think Fukushima could be a good thing for nuclear power. We can learn a lot from that. We can't be smug or too clever.\" According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, 45 countries are now considering embarking on nuclear power programmes, as Vietnam, Bangladesh, United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Belarus are likely to start building this year and Jordan and Saudi Arabia following in 2013. In the UK, strong opposition to nuclear power has soared since the Fukushima disaster, according to a recent Guardian/ICM poll. In early 2010, 39% of people said they would be strongly opposed to a new nuclear power station being built near their home but in February 2012 that rose to 61%. However, an Ipsos Mori poll asking a different question \u2013 how favourable people felt towards nuclear power \u2013 found that support for nuclear had rebounded to pre-Fukushima levels of 40% in favour by December 2011. Internationally, 62% of citizens in 24 countries said they were opposed to nuclear power, in an Ipsos Mori poll conducted in June 2011, three months after the Fukushima catastrophe. Only India, Poland and the US had majorities supporting nuclear power, with the UK evenly split, China, Russia and France clearly opposed and Germany very strongly opposed.",

      "bodyText": "Adults and children are being urged to take part in what is set to be the UK's largest beach clean-up, as a leading conservation charity warns of the long-term risk to marine life from the huge volume of litter swamping the oceans and being washed up onto shores. Plastics make up over half the rubbish retrieved, and pose the biggest single threat to wildlife such as turtles, fish and seabirds \u2013 and the volume of plastic bottles and tops, bags and ropes has increased by 135% since records began in 1994, according to the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). The charity launched a regular annual weekend beach clean in the same year \u2013 the so-called Beachwatch Big Weekend \u2013 but this year is teaming up for the first time with retail giant Marks &amp; Spencer to oversee organised litter-picking sessions at 150 beaches across the UK at the end of May. It hopes that the current record turnout of 5,000 people could be even bigger as a result of the new collaboration. MCS warns that litter is swamping our oceans \u2013 where it is largely unseen \u2013 before being washed up on beaches. MCS measures it by density, last year reporting nearly 2,000 items of rubbish for every kilometre of beach. New figures are due to be published on 22 March. An MCS spokesman said: \"It kills wildlife, looks disgusting, is a hazard to our health and costs millions to clear up. According to last year's Beachwatch report, over half of all litter found was found was made of plastic, which may take thousands of years to fully break down and generally doesn't leave the marine environment. \"Marine wildlife gets entangled in litter and accidentally ingests it. Turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and the bags block their stomachs, often leading to death from starvation. Seabirds mistake floating plastic litter for food, and over 90% of fulmars [a species of seabird] found dead around the North Sea have plastic in their stomachs.\" The May clean-up is part of M&amp;S's environmental initiative Plan A, which saw a 5p charge introduced for plastic bags in 2008, cutting use by 80% and raising over \u00a34 million for charity. As an incentive, customers who register in advance for the clean-up will receive a money-off M&amp;S voucher and a free M&amp;S lunch on the day. Free beach activity packs can be downloaded for children, and at six larger beaches \u2013 including Heacham in north Norfolk, Hazelbank near Belfast and Cramond near Edinburgh \u2013 there will be a free barbecue and kids' games. Marc Bolland, chief executive of M&amp;S, who will be helping out at Heacham, said: \"We rely on our beaches as places to have fun and relax and we rely on our seas to provide us with fish for us to eat, yet we pollute them by allowing them to become landing points for all sorts of rubbish. We hope that as many beach cleaners \u2013 big and small \u2013 will come down to our beaches. Together we can make a real difference, and encourage the next generation to care passionately about protecting our beaches and seas for the future.\"",

      "bodyText": "Nina Beier's work is as unstable as a keg of dynamite, if a whole lot quieter. The Danish artist's sparse, pared-down offerings have included fading photographs, a wall painting that was redone daily and a sculpture recreated via a game of Chinese whispers. Her Dust Painting is literally a pile of dust-coloured pigment, which gets traipsed all over the gallery on the soles of people's shoes. As unassuming as it first appears, her art is an elusive, restless thing, with scant regard for the beautiful picture frames that often attempt to contain it. Until recently, Beier was best known for the work she made with fellow Dane Marie Lund. The duo's quirky interactive projects rewrote the unspoken rules of museum behaviour, from subtle changes such as getting a guard to grow his beard long to raucous disruptions where gallery-goers break the silence and vigorously applaud. In the past few years, however, she's increasingly put objects centre-stage \u2013 albeit ones that have a habit of disappearing. Always changing, eroding or being remade, Beier's creations give the lie to the stamp of permanence bestowed on artworks by frames, glass cases and gallery walls. Her works' origins can be equally hard to pin down. For her 2010 show within Art Basel Statements, the major art fair's special section for younger artists, Beier employed an actress to recreate a sculpture she'd destroyed, using nothing more than a verbal description of the lost work. Far from a straightforward bit of outsourcing, with the actress effectively playing the artist, it set off a tail-chasing game exploring artistic intent, originality and reproduction. This is more than art about art, however: Beier's playful approach snares big, timeless themes, including loss, ageing and death. Shirts vs Skins, her current London show, stages a face-off between frail, mortal humanity and the objects we design to outlive us. It's a tragicomedy Beier delivers with the lightest of touches, as with her glass cabinet boasting a spare display of her retired father's recent golfing trophies. The Blues, a series of outmoded shots of hair models taken from a Copenhagen hairdresser, is particularly droll, full of tousled highlights and razor-cut slanting fringes. But these photographs are hardly frozen in time: long-term display in the salon window has drained the pictures' colour spectrums to washy blues. They're like a reverse Dorian Grey: portraits that age with their subjects. Why we like her: For her series Fatigues, which looks like stain paintings in rolling blues and mauves. In fact they're sections of hardwearing, stain-resistant carpet, with the kind of eye-popping patterns familiar from tube seats and the foyers of public buildings, which the artist has submitted to strenuous chemical dyes. Catch him if you can: One of Beier's hair models is none other than a teenage Leonardo Dicaprio. Where Can I See Her? At Laura Bartlett Gallery, London WC1, until 31 March.",

      "bodyText": "This weekend sees the fourth round of fixtures in the Six Nations tournament. Joining us to discuss the ties in detail is Guardian rugby correspondent Paul Rees. He'll be online from 3pm GMT - but feel free to leave any early questions for him now. Some talking points: \u2022 Can Wales maintain their momentum towards a potential Grand Slam against Italy in Cardiff? \u2022 Will Scotland be able to pick themselves up against Ireland and register their first win of the tournament? \u2022 Is France's new half-back pairing likely to be effective against England at the Stade de France? \u2022 Will England's interim coach Stuart Lancaster ignore criticism of his team's playing style and plan to grind out a win against Les Bleus on Sunday? Please post your questions for him in the comment section below. We are posting questions Paul responds to here to make it easier to follow. expatalan asks: Hallo Paul, how many teams have won the world cup with a non-national (ie. not the same nationality as the team) coach/manager at the helm? Are there any lessons to be learnt from this Paul Rees replies: Fair point. Two of last year's World Cup semi-finalists had 'foreign' coaches and competed for the bronze medal. munci76 asks: Paul, do you think Saint-Andre's team selections against England have a whiff of Lievremont-esque eccentricity about them, of do you think he knows something we don't know? Paul Rees replies: Looks like he does not want his players to play as they did against Ireland, running from deep from the off. It looks as if they will play for territory and opt for more control. Saint-Andre's years in England will shape his approach, as will his analysis of England's defence this season. laraxwell asks: Long time reader and big fan of your work Who is your favourite poster? Paul Rees replies: I guess that woman itching to play tennis. JamesSilkDavey asks: Can Scotland beat Ireland this weekend? How do you rate their chances? Paul Rees replies: Scotland are still waiting for their first victory, although they have managed to beat themselves. They won this fixture two years ago an Ireland are without their talismen in the backline and at forward. Scotland will go for it and one day it has to come right for them. boanova asks: Is, as has been suggested, George North the 'White Lomu'? Paul Rees replies: No. Don't look south, look north. Gareth100 asks: Why do you think Johnathan Davies doesn't seem to get the praise he deserves compared to other current centres? Paul Rees replies: Perhaps because the focus is on individuals rather than combinations. He is like a goal poacher in football, invariably in the right place, reading play well. The Scarlets did well to keep him for another two years. ramay asks: Why are there so few Scottish referees or linesmen and how does that impact on decisions in matches involving Scotland? Paul Rees replies: It is the same with Italy. The system now sees the highest ranked referees given the leading internationals, whereas in times past countries nominated officials. As I understand it, the International Rugby Board is working with Scotland and Italy to develop referees in those countries. munci76 asks: Paul, is it just me, or do the rules of rugby get amended far more often those in other sports? Why do you think this has happened? Were they that bad to begin with? Sometimes I feel I can't keep up, so I pity new fans of the game. Paul Rees replies: They tend to get amended every four years. There are so many laws, and numerous sub-clauses to them, that there will always be a temptation to tinker. The emphasis in the professional era has been on making the game more accessible to a television audience. avsfan asks: Do you see the retention of Charge Down Charlie over Flood as a retrograde step? Paul Rees replies: Surprising, yes, given Flood's contribution when he came on against Wales. Had he not been injured, Flood would probably have started against Scotland but Hodgson scored the try that won that match and secured another chargedown the following week in Rome. If Lancaster is coming at it from the point of view that Hodgson merits a place in the 22 on the strength of his contribution in Edinburgh and Rome, it is understandable, but Flood is unfortunate, doubly so with Owen Farrell playing at 10. MichaelVaughanMyLord says: Paul - re your point on timewasting in the Breakdown, I can't agree that we should go back to the ref owning the clock, that way leads to all sorts of tedious whingeing about why x mins were added. If refs were braver on sealing off and going off feet in the closing stages of a game then we wouldn't see teams running down the clock endlessly (and to be fair this has got better since the Munster Heineken Cup final borefest of a few years ago). I do think that the place kicking time restrictions should be shortened and enforced. During the England v Wales game there were some kicks from both sides took 90 seconds, and it's extremely frustrating to watch to the extent I know I can safely visit the gents and have enough time to not miss any action. Paul Rees responds: I am not sure why the clock continues when a player is taking a conversion considering that the ball is effectively dead. As for stoppage time, it very often runs to eight, nine or 10 minutes. When I watch football, I prefer not knowing exactly how long the referee will add on if my team is losing; if they are winning, I want to know to the exact second. terribleliar asks: Do you think Wales will be put off they charge towards a grand slam in 2012 when the turn up in Rome on Saturday and find out that actually, the fixture is in Cardiff? Paul Rees replies: There's no place like Rome. Grumpyfella asks: Paul, on your time-wasting issue from the Breakdown - what do you think the unintended consequences might be of (a) giving the defending team a scrum put in if the ball is available to the SH and static for more then 5 seconds, or (b) the ref calling the ball out in the same circumstances? Paul Rees replies: More pick-and-gos, a team going nowhere but a bit less slowly. adman1982 asks: in the breakdown you mention whether Wales will play in the Millenium stadium and rightly say it will be disingenous if they do, however as we are all acutely aware money talks, so what do you think is the possiblity of Wales not playing there? Personally I think it is pretty much guaranteed. Paul Rees replies: They will play there, but it should only be if they have rank outsiders in the group, like Namibia. Even then it would be wrong because it is supposed to be a one-nation tournament. What stinks in this is that when the RFU made a pitch for the Millennium Stadium to be used, the talk was about how accessible it was for rugby followers in the west country and along the Monmouthshire and Powys borders. Not sure that Wales would have been too happy to have played Samoa in Apia last September, walkonbye asks: are refs in this years 6 nations being a little being a litte lackadaisical applying the OFFSIDE rule and SIN-BIN/RED CARD situations? Paul Rees replies: Selective in the application of the off-side rule to help with the flow of a game; it should not take a warning or five before a yellow card is flourished. Deebee asks: What do you think of the prospect of Jake White becoming the England coach? Personally, I think it's a massive step back into the Dark Ages to appoint a coach who still believes so fully in the kick and chase, pressure rugby that won the Boks the World Cup in 2007. To my mind, England have nowhere near the quality of forwards needed to employ that plan and would end up getting some serious tonkings from the better sides. Paul Rees replies: It's a bit like Chelsea, looking for managers who have won the Champions League and coming up with Rafa Benitez. White has a long-term contract with the Brumbies: should the RFU be using head-hunters to induce him to break it? He took the view from the start in 2007 that defence would win the World Cup, and given the way the game was refereed then it was not a bad call. South Africa did beat England 36-0 in the pool stage and White is pretty astute. snoopster asks: Hi Paul - in the breakdown you say \"Leicester are as pragmatic a team as any, very often playing a narrow game.\" Do you see the pragmatism in them having scored the most points while competing with Newcastle, at the bottom of the table, for most points conceded? Also \"Tuilagi denied by one of the tackles of the tournament as Sam Warburton cut him down at the moment the centre anticipated scoring, and Strettle defied by the video referee Iain Ramage after the last move of the match.\" Is it progress to drop the fly half from the squad who was involved in setting up that latter chance... and the one that North knocked out of play? England didn't create much else, Manu aside. Paul Rees replies: Leicester have been interesting this season with all they changes they have had to make because of the World Cup, a rash of injuries and now the World Cup. The times I have seen them this season, they have been narrow, and they failed to secure a bonus point at Aironi. Flood is an outside-half worth watching, but while you cite his part in the Strettle 'try', others will point to Dublin a year ago. walkonbye asks: are refs in this years 6 nations being a little being a litte lackadaisical applying the OFFSIDE rule and SIN-BIN/RED CARD situations? Paul Rees replies: Selective in the application of the off-side rule to help with the flow of a game; it should not take a warning or five before a yellow card is flourished. ElliottBayTowers asks: The French fear losing to England like they fear losing to no-one else! For whatever reason England tend to do rather well in Paris (unlike the Celts, who have a dismal record there). Do you sense the French already retreating into their shells with the selection of Beauxis? Paul Rees replies: Playing not to lose? Wales have won at Stade de France three times. ScarletsOHywel asks: Hi Paul, looking ahead to the 2013 Lions tour now, how many players do you think have cemented their place? Can you see any players who haven't made it into this tournament putting their hand up before then? Paul Rees replies: Nobody should be cemented in. Wales would have a shoal were the tour this summer, but a year ago they would have had far fewer. The summer and autumn tours will be revealing. As for players not involved in this tournament, Tom Wood is one, and Luke Fitzgerald may rediscover his form next season. snoopster asks: So, Mr Rees, what do you make of Warburton's comments in his recent blog? He refered to Clerc as \"writhing\" to \"influence the ref\" while Clerc was prone on the ground and, according to the article, though he has now denied it on twitter, said some of his team mates encouraged him to milk the line out incident with Robshaw. He also compare the line out incident to a tip tackle... As a journalist, where do you stand on it? Paul Rees replies: Is simulation becoming more prevalent? Some players fear it is and it is not difficult to believe that some players did want Warburton to make more of an incident which, replays show, owed more to the failure of his lifters than Robshaw. cupofbovril asks: Do you think Ashton and Foden are experiencing a bad run of form or do you agree with Matt O'Connor that England are not getting the best out of their most talented attacking players? Paul Rees replies: Ashton saw a fair bit of the ball against Wales, not sure why has been the wing to switch positions given his success on the right. As England evolve, their attacking game should become more refined. It is a while since they got the best out out Foden and Ashton, not just the last month. ElliottBayTowers asks: To a lesser or greater extent, England, Wales, Scotland, Italy and France are on upward curves. Only Ireland appear to be on a downward curve: - A coach of ever-diminishing credibility - A 'golden generation' - that has provided the spine of the side for a decade or so - now shuffling off into the sunset, either through age, injury or lack of form (BOD, POC, O'Gara, D'Arcy, O'Callaghan). Paul, do you agree that there is only so much the excellent Bowe can do and that these problems will be thrown into the spotlight over the next couple of weeks - first by the budding thistle and then, in a glorious recreation of the events of 19 March 1988, by the mighty men in white? Paul Rees replies: Munster were being written off not so long ago and Ireland did tilt the axis of the World Cup by beating Australia. They have a core of top-quality players but are they sharp enough tactically? Their Heineken Cup sides know what they are about but do Ireland? Sparebulb asks: I only bet on the Six Nations, why are the odds so crap? My bet for this weekend is for Wales to beat Italy by between 25-30 points difference, this is a speculative bet but I only got 25/2. Clearly Wales will be happy with any win over Italy, to save themselves for France, so my question is: What is your opinion on my hopes of collecting on my bet? Paul Rees replies: Wales want to improve their points difference because it could determine where they finish in the table if they fail to beat France. They will say they will be happy with a victory over Italy, but they will be out to replicate Ireland and put Italy away in the second-half. macquiff asks: Paul, do you agree that there is only so much the excellent Manu can do and that these problems will further be thrown into the spotlight over the next couple of weeks - first by the crowing cockerel and then, in a glorious recreation of well pretty much all their recent encounters, by the green goblins? Paul Rees replies: The Ireland game will reveal more about England than Paris where you expect them to front up in defence. They took the game to Wales without scoring a try and Ireland have conceded a few. BehemothTheCat asks: Afternoon Mr. Rees. What's your opinion on the Shingler ruling, and do you think it's a bit, well, naughty to use the U20's as the second side? Paul Rees replies: Naughty, no, because it allows the likes of Samoa, Fiji and Tonga to claim players at an age when they are receiving offers to play abroad. Where it is naughty is for a country of France's playing population to use the Under-20s as its second side. Sympathy for Shingler is diluted because he was told he would be committing himself internationally by playing for Wales in an Under-20 international against France, but a year before, when two other Welsh players appeared against France in an Under-20s match and subsequently declared their allegiance to Ireland, they won their case because France at that time had an A side. Where the regulation falls down is that dual-qualified twin brothers could take part in this year's Junior World Championship for one country; depending on who they play against, a country that used the Under-20s as its second time or one that runs an A team, they could return home having played the same number of matches but with one tied to one country while the other would still have the alternative option. BehemothTheCat also asks: Also, Mr. Rees- What's your opinion on Coldplay? Evil Incarnate and worth putting to the sword or what? Paul Rees replies: Is that the Chris Martin who had a rush of blood to the head in 1985 and dropped a high ball at the Arms Park to give Jonathan Davies a dream debut? mossa asks: Paul, what has been your favourite match of this years 6N so far ? Paul Rees replies: England-Wales was compelling and France-Italy was nicely anarchic. Enjoyed Scotland-France and felt very disappointed for Andy Robinson.",

Scotland will go for it and one day it has to come right for them.</p> <h2>boanova <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/08/six-nations-webchat-rugby-union-paul-rees?commentpage=1#comment-15048333\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Is, as has been suggested, George North the 'White Lomu'?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15051628\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>No. Don't look south, look north.</p> <h2>Gareth100 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15048397\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Why do you think Johnathan Davies doesn't seem to get the praise he deserves compared to other current centres?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15051663\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Perhaps because the focus is on individuals rather than combinations. He is like a goal poacher in football, invariably in the right place, reading play well. The Scarlets did well to keep him for another two years.</p> <h2>ramay <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15048491\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Why are there so few Scottish referees or linesmen and how does that impact on decisions in matches involving Scotland?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15051721\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>It is the same with Italy. The system now sees the highest ranked referees given the leading internationals, whereas in times past countries nominated officials. As I understand it, the International Rugby Board is working with Scotland and Italy to develop referees in those countries.</p> <h2>munci76 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15048526\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Paul, is it just me, or do the rules of rugby get amended far more often those in other sports? Why do you think this has happened? Were they that bad to begin with?</p> <p>Sometimes I feel I can't keep up, so I pity new fans of the game.</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15051777\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>They tend to get amended every four years. There are so many laws, and numerous sub-clauses to them, that there will always be a temptation to tinker. The emphasis in the professional era has been on making the game more accessible to a television audience.</p> <h2>avsfan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15048557\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Do you see the retention of Charge Down Charlie over Flood as a retrograde step?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15051903\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Surprising, yes, given Flood's contribution when he came on against Wales. Had he not been injured, Flood would probably have started against Scotland but Hodgson scored the try that won that match and secured another chargedown the following week in Rome. If Lancaster is coming at it from the point of view that Hodgson merits a place in the 22 on the strength of his contribution in Edinburgh and Rome, it is understandable, but Flood is unfortunate, doubly so with Owen Farrell playing at 10.</p> <h2>MichaelVaughanMyLord <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15048593\">says</a>:</h2> <p>Paul - re your point on timewasting in the Breakdown, I can't agree that we should go back to the ref owning the clock, that way leads to all sorts of tedious whingeing about why x mins were added. If refs were braver on sealing off and going off feet in the closing stages of a game then we wouldn't see teams running down the clock endlessly (and to be fair this has got better since the Munster Heineken Cup final borefest of a few years ago).</p> <p>I do think that the place kicking time restrictions should be shortened and enforced. During the England v Wales game there were some kicks from both sides took 90 seconds, and it's extremely frustrating to watch to the extent I know I can safely visit the gents and have enough time to not miss any action.</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15051991\">responds</a>:</h2> <p>I am not sure why the clock continues when a player is taking a conversion considering that the ball is effectively dead.</p> <p>As for stoppage time, it very often runs to eight, nine or 10 minutes. When I watch football, I prefer not knowing exactly how long the referee will add on if my team is losing; if they are winning, I want to know to the exact second.</p> <h2>terribleliar <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15048623\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Do you think Wales will be put off they charge towards a grand slam in 2012 when the turn up in Rome on Saturday and find out that actually, the fixture is in Cardiff?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052014\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>There's no place like Rome.</p> <h2>Grumpyfella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15048912\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Paul, on your time-wasting issue from the Breakdown - what do you think the unintended consequences might be of (a) giving the defending team a scrum put in if the ball is available to the SH and static for more then 5 seconds, or (b) the ref calling the ball out in the same circumstances?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052060\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>More pick-and-gos, a team going nowhere but a bit less slowly.</p> <h2>adman1982 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15048988\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>in the breakdown you mention whether Wales will play in the Millenium stadium and rightly say it will be disingenous if they do, however as we are all acutely aware money talks, so what do you think is the possiblity of Wales not playing there? Personally I think it is pretty much guaranteed.</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052142\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>They will play there, but it should only be if they have rank outsiders in the group, like Namibia. Even then it would be wrong because it is supposed to be a one-nation tournament. What stinks in this is that when the RFU made a pitch for the Millennium Stadium to be used, the talk was about how accessible it was for rugby followers in the west country and along the Monmouthshire and Powys borders. Not sure that Wales would have been too happy to have played Samoa in Apia last September,</p> <h2>walkonbye <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049029\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>are refs in this years 6 nations being a little being a litte lackadaisical applying the OFFSIDE rule and SIN-BIN/RED CARD situations?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052179\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Selective in the application of the off-side rule to help with the flow of a game; it should not take a warning or five before a yellow card is flourished.</p> <h2>Deebee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049109\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>What do you think of the prospect of Jake White becoming the England coach? Personally, I think it's a massive step back into the Dark Ages to appoint a coach who still believes so fully in the kick and chase, pressure rugby that won the Boks the World Cup in 2007.</p> <p>To my mind, England have nowhere near the quality of forwards needed to employ that plan and would end up getting some serious tonkings from the better sides.</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052288\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>It's a bit like Chelsea, looking for managers who have won the Champions League and coming up with Rafa Benitez. White has a long-term contract with the Brumbies: should the RFU be using head-hunters to induce him to break it? He took the view from the start in 2007 that defence would win the World Cup, and given the way the game was refereed then it was not a bad call. South Africa did beat England 36-0 in the pool stage and White is pretty astute.</p> <h2>snoopster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049115\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Hi Paul - in the breakdown you say \"Leicester are as pragmatic a team as any, very often playing a narrow game.\"<br>Do you see the pragmatism in them having scored the most points while competing with Newcastle, at the bottom of the table, for most points conceded?</p> <p>Also \"Tuilagi denied by one of the tackles of the tournament as Sam Warburton cut him down at the moment the centre anticipated scoring, and Strettle defied by the video referee Iain Ramage after the last move of the match.\"</p> <p>Is it progress to drop the fly half from the squad who was involved in setting up that latter chance... and the one that North knocked out of play? England didn't create much else, Manu aside.</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052355\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Leicester have been interesting this season with all they changes they have had to make because of the World Cup, a rash of injuries and now the World Cup. The times I have seen them this season, they have been narrow, and they failed to secure a bonus point at Aironi. Flood is an outside-half worth watching, but while you cite his part in the Strettle 'try', others will point to Dublin a year ago.</p> <h2><br>walkonbye <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049029\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>are refs in this years 6 nations being a little being a litte lackadaisical applying the OFFSIDE rule and SIN-BIN/RED CARD situations?</p> <p>Paul Rees <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052179\">replies</a>:</p> <p>Selective in the application of the off-side rule to help with the flow of a game; it should not take a warning or five before a yellow card is flourished.</p> <h2>ElliottBayTowers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049162\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>The French fear losing to England like they fear losing to no-one else!</p> <p>For whatever reason England tend to do rather well in Paris (unlike the Celts, who have a dismal record there). Do you sense the French already retreating into their shells with the selection of Beauxis?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052466\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Playing not to lose? Wales have won at Stade de France three times.</p> <h2>ScarletsOHywel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049240\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Hi Paul, looking ahead to the 2013 Lions tour now, how many players do you think have cemented their place? Can you see any players who haven't made it into this tournament putting their hand up before then?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052564\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Nobody should be cemented in. Wales would have a shoal were the tour this summer, but a year ago they would have had far fewer. The summer and autumn tours will be revealing. As for players not involved in this tournament, Tom Wood is one, and Luke Fitzgerald may rediscover his form next season.</p> <h2>snoopster <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049292\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>So, Mr Rees, what do you make of Warburton's comments in his recent blog?</p> <p>He refered to Clerc as \"writhing\" to \"influence the ref\" while Clerc was prone on the ground and, according to the article, though he has now denied it on twitter, said some of his team mates encouraged him to milk the line out incident with Robshaw. He also compare the line out incident to a tip tackle...</p> <p>As a journalist, where do you stand on it?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052636\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Is simulation becoming more prevalent? Some players fear it is and it is not difficult to believe that some players did want Warburton to make more of an incident which, replays show, owed more to the failure of his lifters than Robshaw.</p> <h2>cupofbovril <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049425\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Do you think Ashton and Foden are experiencing a bad run of form or do you agree with Matt O'Connor that England are not getting the best out of their most talented attacking players?</p> <p>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052685\">replies</a>:</p> <p>Ashton saw a fair bit of the ball against Wales, not sure why has been the wing to switch positions given his success on the right. As England evolve, their attacking game should become more refined. It is a while since they got the best out out Foden and Ashton, not just the last month.</p> <h2>ElliottBayTowers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049458\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>To a lesser or greater extent, England, Wales, Scotland, Italy and France are on upward curves. Only Ireland appear to be on a downward curve:</p> <p>- A coach of ever-diminishing credibility</p> <p>- A 'golden generation' - that has provided the spine of the side for a decade or so - now shuffling off into the sunset, either through age, injury or lack of form (BOD, POC, O'Gara, D'Arcy, O'Callaghan).</p> <p>Paul, do you agree that there is only so much the excellent Bowe can do and that these problems will be thrown into the spotlight over the next couple of weeks - first by the budding thistle and then, in a glorious recreation of the events of 19 March 1988, by the mighty men in white?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052762\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Munster were being written off not so long ago and Ireland did tilt the axis of the World Cup by beating Australia. They have a core of top-quality players but are they sharp enough tactically? Their Heineken Cup sides know what they are about but do Ireland?</p> <h2>Sparebulb <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049483\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>I only bet on the Six Nations, why are the odds so crap? My bet for this weekend is for Wales to beat Italy by between 25-30 points difference, this is a speculative bet but I only got 25/2. Clearly Wales will be happy with any win over Italy, to save themselves for France, so my question is: What is your opinion on my hopes of collecting on my bet?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052804\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Wales want to improve their points difference because it could determine where they finish in the table if they fail to beat France. They will say they will be happy with a victory over Italy, but they will be out to replicate Ireland and put Italy away in the second-half.</p> <h2>macquiff <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15049548\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Paul, do you agree that there is only so much the excellent Manu can do and that these problems will further be thrown into the spotlight over the next couple of weeks - first by the crowing cockerel and then, in a glorious recreation of well pretty much all their recent encounters, by the green goblins?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15052869\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>The Ireland game will reveal more about England than Paris where you expect them to front up in defence. They took the game to Wales without scoring a try and Ireland have conceded a few.</p> <h2>BehemothTheCat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15050084\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Afternoon Mr. Rees.</p> <p>What's your opinion on the Shingler ruling, and do you think it's a bit, well, naughty to use the U20's as the second side?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15053116\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>Naughty, no, because it allows the likes of Samoa, Fiji and Tonga to claim players at an age when they are receiving offers to play abroad.</p> <p>Where it is naughty is for a country of France's playing population to use the Under-20s as its second side. Sympathy for Shingler is diluted because he was told he would be committing himself internationally by playing for Wales in an Under-20 international against France, but a year before, when two other Welsh players appeared against France in an Under-20s match and subsequently declared their allegiance to Ireland, they won their case because France at that time had an A side. Where the regulation falls down is that dual-qualified twin brothers could take part in this year's Junior World Championship for one country; depending on who they play against, a country that used the Under-20s as its second time or one that runs an A team, they could return home having played the same number of matches but with one tied to one country while the other would still have the alternative option.</p> <h2>BehemothTheCat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15050126\">also asks</a>:</h2> <p>Also, Mr. Rees-</p> <p>What's your opinion on Coldplay? Evil Incarnate and worth putting to the sword or what?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15053159\">replies</a>:<br></h2> <p>Is that the Chris Martin who had a rush of blood to the head in 1985 and dropped a high ball at the Arms Park to give Jonathan Davies a dream debut?</p> <h2>mossa <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15050200\">asks</a>:</h2> <p>Paul, what has been your favourite match of this years 6N so far ?</p> <h2>Paul Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15053244\">replies</a>:</h2> <p>England-Wales was compelling and France-Italy was nicely anarchic. Enjoyed Scotland-France and felt very disappointed for Andy Robinson.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are a fair number of major cultural organisations in the UK, with a corresponding number of directors and CEOs. These are big jobs. They're important jobs. They come with a hefty slice of power and responsibility, and it's true to say that a large proportion of these jobs are held by men. As Cara Courage cited earlier this week, research undertaken for the Clore Leadership Programme in 2008 indicates that men outnumber women in creative and cultural leadership roles by 2.5 to 1. Now, I passionately believe that gender should never be a barrier to a person getting the job they want and deserve, but I know that in some cases it still is. A few boards, recruiters, leaders and funders still take decisions that are based, however subliminally, on their assumptions about women, not on the skills and competencies of the candidate. There are also still workplaces that are failing to support their staff in balancing their personal and family lives with their working ones. This is unacceptable and we should all do everything in our power to put a stop to it. However, is this the sole reason we don't see as many women in leadership as we should? I think the issue might be more complex. I have been thinking a lot about 'leadership' lately. I am lucky enough to be one of this year's Clore Fellowship cohort and I have also been involved in the brilliant mentoring programme at the Southbank Centre. To me, leaders are people who have innovative and exciting ideas and make them happen. They are people who can see things they want to change in the world and then make plans to instigate the changes. They bring others with them, sometimes by doing and making stuff, sometimes by inspiring, listening, by asking difficult questions, and mostly by helping people articulate and get motoring on their own plans. It seems to me that there are lots and lots of different ways to lead, and from where I stand I can see thousands of women in the arts getting on with it and doing brilliant things. Some of them are looking at the ladder that leads to the directorship of big cultural institutions and are climbing up it (and I salute them), but other women I know are looking at that ladder, dismantling it and making it into other things: bridges, bicycles, rafts and communication devices. Identifying the best leadership route to get your ideas off the ground isn't only sensible, it's essential. Our sector, as ever, is in flux: there are fewer resources, centralised infrastructure is disappearing and technology is enabling us to access art, people and information whenever we want. To navigate this new world we need to collaborate and influence, we need to talk to each other, and we need to share generously what we know and what we have. Old notions of hierarchy seem to be dissolving and the strength of our relationships with each other are becoming more and more important. Those women setting up networks, writing blogs, pulling together collectives and testing out new ways of working seem to me to be ahead of the curve \u2013 creating a new arts ecology and not just responding to it. So what do I think about women in arts leadership? I think discrimination in any form is appalling and we should challenge it wherever we see it. It's our duty to smash through glass ceilings where we find them and make our own organisations and projects shining beacons of fairness and equality. But I also think it's our job to change what we classify as a 'leadership role'. We should recognise and acknowledge the ideas and skills of the women we know who are changing the world, and celebrate and value all the ways they choose to do it.

      "bodyText": "London theatres will offer discounted tickets to commuters during the Olympics as part of a Society of London Theatre scheme intended to ease anticipated pressures on the capital's public transport this summer. People working in areas deemed liable to be particularly crowded will be offered \u00a310 tickets to a number of major West End shows, including The Phantom of the Opera, The 39 Steps and Mamma Mia!, as an incentive to travel home outside peak times. With hundreds of thousands of additional visitors expected, Transport for London is braced for further strain on the capital's public transport network, which already carries 1.1bn passengers a year. Solt's chief executive Julian Bird announced the plans yesterday, at a TfL event that explained similar initiatives across a range of businesses and attractions, including Madame Tussauds and the Sanctuary Spa. TfL will run a voucher scheme encompassing the various plans, with discounts available to those who can prove they work in transport \"hotspots\" such as Canary Wharf or Westminster. Bird said: \"When the 2012 Games get under way, many employees in transport hot-spot locations will be looking to re-time their commute and enjoy the festival atmosphere.\" \"To help, we will be providing them with reduced priced tickets to some of the best theatre shows around through our new spring promotion and at tkts in Leicester Square, London.\" Solt will announce full details of the scheme and participating shows in April. In spite of several major voices of concern, including Andrew Lloyd Webber's prediction of \"a bloodbath of a summer,\" Bird remains optimistic about the prospects for London theatre during the Olympic period. He recently told Variety that research had shown transport to be a major concern among audiences, adding, \"we've now seen the detailed planning and it shouldn't be a problem.\" Ben Plowden, TfL's director of surface planning, explained, \"We know that at certain times and in certain locations the public transport network will be much busier than usual. That's why we are teaming up with a range of London's top attractions to ensure that people able to travel home outside peak hours are spoilt for choice when deciding how to spend their evening.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Special Relationship (2010) Director: Richard Loncraine Entertainment grade: C History grade: A\u2013 Bill Clinton's second term as US president coincided approximately with Tony Blair's first term as British prime minister. Space It's 1996, and Tony Blair (Michael Sheen, as ever), leader of the Labour party, meets President Bill Clinton (Dennis Quaid). Blair is all nerves as he tiptoes into the Oval Office. He needn't be. \"I believe you're going to win by a landslide,\" purrs Clinton. The president shows Blair one of the nick-nacks of state: a lump of moon rock. \"Sometimes,\" he says, \"when things get stressful around here, I shut that door, sit on that couch and hold that rock, and think: we all just got to chill a little\". You may have been under the impression that Bill Clinton's preferred form of relaxation in the Oval Office took a rather different form. In real life, though, he does seem to have been partial to moon rock. Thirty years ago, a lump of the stuff brought back by the Apollo 17 mission, valued at $10m, went missing from the governor's office in Arkansas. In 2011, it was found by an archivist \u2013 among Bill Clinton's papers. Whoops! Butterfingers. Dialogue Clinton wins his second term, and Blair his first. The president visits London for a second date. \"I suppose you know the awful term 'special relationship'?\" stammers Blair. Awful? The term was coined by Winston Churchill, who was certainly a superior orator to Blair. \"Neither the sure prevention of war, nor the continuous rise of world organisation will be gained without what I have called the fraternal association of the English-speaking peoples\", Churchill told an audience in 1946. \"This means a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States.\" Surely, in real life, both Blair and Clinton would know that. Drama Blair and Clinton's friendship grows against the backdrop of their big \"legacy\" events: the peace process in Northern Ireland, intervention in Kosovo. Historically, the film is well researched. Dramatically, it feels episodic, and keeps losing its narrative footing under fire from these big stories. From a cinematic point of view, it might actually have helped had it been less historically accurate. There would be more tension if the two men were trapped in some kind of intense, exclusive partnership, burgeoning with homoerotically suggestive undercurrents, on which their fates depended. Like Butch and Sundance. Frodo and Sam. Bert and Ernie. Instead, the film sticks to the facts \u2013 but those don't amount to much. Scandal During the Kosovo crisis, that relationship sours. It's not helped by Clinton's notorious troubles with a former intern, Monica Lewinsky. \"He's lied to everybody else,\" Blair snaps. \"Why should he tell me the truth?\" According to Blair's biographer Anthony Seldon, the Lewinsky affair did rattle Blair's faith in Clinton. On the other hand, Seldon also says \"the relationship [between Blair and Clinton], for all its undoubted importance particularly early on, turns out to have amounted to less than is widely believed.\" Which again begs the question: why did anyone make a film about this? Early drafts of Peter Morgan's screenplay covered the Blair-George W Bush relationship as well. Ultimately, historians may find that bizarre and consequential partnership more intriguing. Elections Clinton visits Blair at Chequers after the end of his presidency, just as the Supreme Court decides Bush v Gore in favour of Bush. Blair seems open to the new guy. \"The question you need to ask yourself is: what business does a progressive centre-left politician from a tiny island in Europe have, making friends with folks like that?\" asks Clinton. \"But then again, I'm not sure whether you are a progressive centre-left politician any more. Or if you ever were.\" This sounds like a disillusioned former Labour voter speaking, not Clinton. Reportedly, Clinton's real words to Blair on this occasion were: \"Don't screw up your election like Al did.\" Verdict The Special Relationship is a smart, well-researched depiction of relations between Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. There's just not much of a story to tell.",

      "bodyText": "A quick run-down of the raft of full-year results this morning. Aviva beat City forecasts with a 6% rise in profits last year to \u00a32.5bn. Profit before tax slumped to \u00a387m from \u00a32.4bn, including a \u00a3726m loss relating to its Dutch subsidiary Delta Lloyd. Oriel Securities analyst Marcus Barnard said: \"At first glance a better than expected set of results, with plenty for the bulls and something for the bears.\" He said the dividend had fallen slightly short. Aviva will pay out 26p a share to shareholders, up just 2% from 2010 and below expectations of 26.8p. More from my colleague Julia Kollewe here. The shares rose 9.2 to 360.4p. Sticking with financial stocks, Schroders said net inflows into its funds last year tumbled to \u00a33.2bn compared with a record \u00a327bn billion in 2010, reflecting concern over the debt crisis and broader macroeconomic worries during 2011. Pre-tax profits inched up to \u00a3407m. The fund manager said appetite from retail investors had improved this year. The shares dropped 31p to \u00a315.30. Morrisons supermarkets had a good year. Pre-tax profits rose 8% to \u00a3947m on sales up 7% at \u00a317.6bn. But Oriel Securities remain sellers of the stock: \"Morrisons' prelims are undoubtedly strong and show good margin management in straightened times. Life will get tougher in the sector though and rhetoric remains more of a 'wait and see' nature so we would use any strength in the shares as a further selling opportunity.\" The shares ticked up 7.2p to 292p. Cinemas operator Cineworld said pre-tax profits rose 9.9% to \u00a333.4m as sales edged up 1.5% to \u00a3348m. More from Katie Allen here. The shares rose 10.5p to 210p. Engineering group Spirax Sarco saw its shares jump 6% to \u00a321.36. Pre-tax profits rose 7% to \u00a3132m on revenues of \u00a3650m, driven by a strong performance from its specialised pumps unit and higher demand in Asia Pacific. Clarkson posted a 9% rise in full-year pre-tax profits on the back of a challenging economic environment and worsening debt market. Revenues slipped marignally to \u00a3195m. Shares in the shipping services company rose 17p to \u00a313.29. Finally, Corin Group, a manufacturer and supplier of orthopaedic devices, posted a full-year loss of \u00a3300,000, mainly due to the cost of an aborted acquisition. The company said finance director Michael Roller will leave the company. The shares dropped 5% to 48.25p.",

      "bodyText": "With the CloudStore newly launched and its first user secured, interest around cloud is ramping up among public sector's IT buyers. The NHS will be no exception, according to Kevin Holland, service management consultant for Connecting for Health (CfH). Within 18 months, every NHS organisation will be using some sort of cloud service, he predicts. Although CfH is not \"naive enough\" to believe that NHS organisations will drop current technologies favour of CloudStore services, Holland maintains that a spike in cloud adoption will come when existing contracts are due for renewal. At that point, he says, health bodies should examine their actual needs, and see if there are any cloud services \u2013 either singly or in combination \u2013 that can be used to meet them. \"The principle being you shouldn't be specifying something, you should be seeing what is available,\" he says. \"It's a different challenge and mindset.\" Rather than stipulating what sort of services should be included in the CloudStore, the Government Procurement Service left it to suppliers to offer what cloud services they had. Those services that are featured as part of the catalogue are therefore those that vendors believe would appeal to the largest cross section of public sector buyers. Do the CloudStore's services need to be specially designed for the NHS? Yes, says Holland. \"The services up there now are very much the sort every organisation would want to take. But as the CloudStore becomes the way of offering services to the public sector, organisations that have vertical market solutions for the NHS should be looking to the CloudStore as a way of providing those services.\" The highly scalable nature of cloud services mean they are perfect for clinical trials that need computing power and storage for a short period, according to Holland. The NHS has been using cloud services for some time - he cites NHSmail as one example, and the electronic staff record has been hosted remotely by McKesson for over five years, as another. Holland also highlights the increasing take up of collaboration tools, which is set to accelerate after the health and social care bill is passed. \"There are already collaboration tools which are provided through cloud services, so that instead of having to set up your own Sharepoint site, people are getting access to collaboration tools. Huddle is one we are using within the Cabinet Office,\" he says. If there is one issue seeming to hold back the adoption of cloud services it is that of data sovereignty, and the question of whether sensitive public data should be allowed to be kept offshore. \"The challenges for security are no different [than for on-premise technology], the solutions are no different. It is about looking at your threats, your vulnerabilities and whether the person housing the data can mitigate against those,\" Holland says, adding that data could be stored in an environment without high security if its encryption is strong enough. Winning hearts and minds is the biggest challenge facing the adoption of cloud, according to Holland with not only the IT department, but people at all levels of organisations needing to change. The finance department, for example, has traditionally bought technology out of the capital budget - cloud services, bought from opex, represent a different model. \"IT organisations have changed over the years and cloud services is just one of the factors that is changing how the IT department will work on behalf of their business.\" This article is published by Guardian Professional.

      "bodyText": "It is now exactly six years since the catastrophic British intervention in Helmand. It was in March 2006 that 16 Air Assault Brigade deployed to the province in force. Prior to its move to the south of Afghanistan the British had had five fatal casualties. In Helmand itself neither the small US army force, nor the occasional SAS patrol had taken any casualties at all. The few Taliban were contained by the governor and his militia and Helmand was one of the wealthiest provinces, largely due to its opium crop. Exactly five years on and 404 military personnel British armed forces have been killed, and the US marines who entered the province to bale them out have taken several hundred more. The death of six British soldiers are of life-shattering consequence to their families. For Helmandis they will have little significance. They are concerned at the risk to themselves, from Taliban and indeed British and Nato forces. Yet civilian casualties inflicted by UK or Nato forces in the province are not reported or even counted by the MoD or Nato. We will know the names of our dead soldiers. We will never know who was the 404th Helmandi civilian to die. What we can be sure of is that it was a long time ago. When I served in Helmand, as a civilian adviser, the only dead person I saw was a six-month old child killed by a British soldier in an accidental shooting. In the few months I was in the province in 2007 the numbers of civilian casualties in Helmand exceeded by orders of magnitude all foreign military casualties. In just two Nato \"collateral damage\" attacks in Baghran and Hyderabad, both Helmandi villages, well over 100 people were killed. Matters have only become worse since then. We do count one category of Afghan deaths, those who are claimed to be \"insurgents\". In numbering the dead bodies of our enemies, our military spokesmen have taken a somewhat split approach. In 2007 body counts were all the rage. In 2008, for a brief period they stopped, at least in Helmand, and then started again. In 2009 General Stanley McChrystal stopped them again, until he self-destructed with the assistance of Rolling Stone magazine. Under subsequent commanders there has been a great enthusiasm for informing the British public how many \"insurgents\" have been \"taken out\" and how useful it is to final victory. I am told that we now \"take out\" 50 Taliban for every British soldier killed. Ben Anderson points out in his excellent book No Worse Enemy that for all the British and Nato claims of hundreds of \"enemy killed in action\", very few bodies are actually found, leading one to believe that either the Taliban have a first rate casualty-clearing and registration system, or that our claims are massively inflated. The appalling damage inflicted by British and other Nato forces on Helmandi people does not stop at the hundreds of uncounted dead and disabled men, women and children in Helmand itself. In trying to escape danger, tens of thousands of Helmandis now live in the most desperate, abject poverty in unofficial \"illegal settlements\" in Kabul where dozens of children have frozen to death. These are not \"camps\" you understand, because then their inmates would become internally displaced persons. We cannot have people like that adding to the troubles of the democratic Afghan government whom we, unlike the vast majority of Afghans, support. One such family in Najam Baghram \"camp\" in Kabul is headed by Saleem Mohammed, who featured on an outstanding ITN programme two weeks ago burying his last two children who had frozen to death. What was not reported in that piece is that those two children were the last of eight. The other six had been killed in a Nato air attack in Helmand. Needless to say these victims appear on no publicly available Nato report. We must remember our dead and ensure that our lifelong obligation to our wounded soldiers is met. The last six years have run up another debt of honour. In 2006, Helmand was a relatively peaceful if corruptly run and highly conservative backwater. We bear an appalling responsibility to the people whose province we entered and played no small part in turning into the most savage combat zone on the planet. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "Last week, to mark St David's Day, we asked for your favourite songs by Welsh musicians. And cometh the hour (or week), cometh the man. Or in this case, cometh Man, possibly the finest prog rock band to emerge from Merthyr Tydfil. Funky isn't an adjective you'd often apply to prog, but it is often apt in the case of Man. The instrumental Never Say Nups to Nepalese takes us on a picaresque but gripping journey. And there's more unexpected funkiness in Searching for Mr Right by Cardiff's top minimalists Young Marble Giants. Cornwall's favourite son Aphex Twin has Welsh parents, so at the risk of sounding like the Wales football manager, he qualifies. Flim features dreamy piano, sub-bass and polyrhythms a go-go. Richard James's namesake in Gorky's Zygotic Mynci wrote Eating Salt Is Easy, a softly acoustic song that's at once reassuringly calm and as strange as can be. It's hard to imagine Gorky's (\"the greatest band of all time\", says RR commenter Dode) or Super Furry Animals existing without Meic Stevens. Rowena explains why \"the Welsh Dylan\" is revered in his homeland. Four decades later, Cardiff-based Nico-esque chanteuse Cate Le Bon keeps the Welsh psychedelia flag flying on Fold the Cloth, from her latest album Cyrk. Badfinger are chiefly remembered for signing to the Beatles' Apple label and recording Paul McCartney's Come and Get It, but then being forever compared to the Fabs; the tragedy of Pete Ham and Tom Evans, who both took their own lives; and for writing Without You, a hit for Harry Nilsson. They left a rich and rewarding catalogue, including No Matter What, a power-pop nugget and top 10 US hit. Badfinger's Apple labelmate Mary Hopkin is happily still with us. Her virginal and unadorned Y Blodyn Gwyn (The White Flower) is blissfully pretty. Also sung in Welsh, Y Penderfyniad is beautifully played and catchy as hell. That keyboard riff! It was released in 1976 by Welsh independent label Sain by west coast (of Britain) rockers Edward H Dafis. \"Guns don't kill people, rappers do\", assert Newport's foremost hip-hop satirists Goldie Lookin Chain in their clever deconstruction of tired arguments about music and violence. A sample of KRS-One's Sound of Da Police is put to good use, and I love the way they pronounce \"Zulu\". Rockpile (Welsh members: Dave Edmunds and drummer Terry Williams) were unusual in that they only released one album under their own name, but several masquerading as Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe solo albums. Adding to the confusion, a live version of Heart of the City appeared on a Lowe album and then \u2013 with a new lead vocal overdubbed \u2013 on an Edmunds one. This clip features a sneering Lowe fronting a Velvets-y Rockpile on Revolver (host Peter Cook briefly glimpsed). You nominated many songs by an actual genuine real-life Velvet, John Cale. Which one to choose? He used Dylan Thomas's poetry in The Falklands Suite, a musical response to the 1982 war between Britain and Argentina, and eventually performed Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night at the opening of the Welsh Assembly. Produced by Brian Eno, it's sombre (Cale gives good sombre), repetitive (Eno gives good repetitive) and life-affirming.

      "body": "<p>Last week, to mark St David's Day, we asked for your <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/mar/01/readers-recommend-welsh-songs\" title=\"\">favourite songs by Welsh musicians</a>.</p> <p>And cometh the hour (or week), cometh the man. Or in this case, cometh Man, possibly the finest prog rock band to emerge from Merthyr Tydfil. Funky isn't an adjective you'd often apply to prog, but it is often apt in the case of Man. The instrumental Never Say Nups to Nepalese takes us on a picaresque but gripping journey. And there's more unexpected funkiness in Searching for Mr Right by Cardiff's top minimalists Young Marble Giants.</p> <p>Cornwall's favourite son Aphex Twin has Welsh parents, so at the risk of sounding like the Wales football manager, he qualifies. Flim features dreamy piano, sub-bass and polyrhythms a go-go. Richard James's namesake in Gorky's Zygotic Mynci wrote Eating Salt Is Easy, a softly acoustic song that's at once reassuringly calm and as strange as can be.</p> <p>It's hard to imagine Gorky's (\"the greatest band of all time\", says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/14984585\" title=\"\">RR commenter Dode</a>) or Super Furry Animals existing without <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/music/player?sid=30892136&amp;ac=now\" title=\"\">Meic Stevens</a>. Rowena explains why \"the Welsh Dylan\" is revered in his homeland. Four decades later, Cardiff-based Nico-esque chanteuse Cate Le Bon keeps the Welsh psychedelia flag flying on Fold the Cloth, from her latest album Cyrk.</p> <p>Badfinger are chiefly remembered for signing to the Beatles' Apple label and recording Paul McCartney's Come and Get It, but then being forever compared to the Fabs; the tragedy of Pete Ham and Tom Evans, who both took their own lives; and for writing Without You, a hit for Harry Nilsson. They left a rich and rewarding catalogue, including No Matter What, a power-pop nugget and top 10 US hit. Badfinger's Apple labelmate Mary Hopkin is happily still with us. Her virginal and unadorned Y Blodyn Gwyn (The White Flower) is blissfully pretty.</p> <p>Also sung in Welsh, Y Penderfyniad is beautifully played and catchy as hell. That keyboard riff! It was released in 1976 by Welsh independent label Sain by west coast (of Britain) rockers Edward H Dafis.</p> <p>\"Guns don't kill people, rappers do\", assert Newport's foremost hip-hop satirists Goldie Lookin Chain in their clever deconstruction of tired arguments about music and violence. A sample of KRS-One's Sound of Da Police is put to good use, and I love the way they pronounce \"Zulu\".</p> <p>Rockpile (Welsh members: Dave Edmunds and drummer Terry Williams) were unusual in that they only released one album under their own name, but several masquerading as Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe solo albums. Adding to the confusion, a live version of Heart of the City appeared on a Lowe album and then \u2013 with a new lead vocal overdubbed \u2013 on an Edmunds one. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_V6NpoUoaM\" title=\"\">This clip</a> features a sneering Lowe fronting a Velvets-y Rockpile on Revolver (host Peter Cook briefly glimpsed).</p> <p>You nominated many songs by an actual genuine real-life Velvet, John Cale.

      "bodyText": "Definitions | Rights and Licence to Use | Logos and Credits | Display and Removal of Content | Revenues &amp; Payments | Status of Contributors and Suppliers as Independent Contractors | Confidentiality | Warranties and Exclusion of Liability | Termination | General | These terms and conditions for content network supply agreements set out the terms under which you, as a Partner of GNM's Content Networks, agree to supply content to GNM. They should be read in conjunction with the Term Sheet issued to you by GNM and together these form your Agreement with GNM. Please read these terms carefully. You shall be legally bound by these terms when GNM sends You a countersigned Term Sheet. You are advised to print off and keep a paper copy of these terms. 1. Definitions 1.1 The words and phrases defined in bold on the Term Sheet shall bear those meanings when they are used in this Agreement. 2. Rights and Licence to Use 2.1 Partner shall retain all copyright and all other right, title and interest in and to the Content. In consideration for displaying the Content and the Partner Logo on the GNM Platforms, Partner hereby grants GNM: 2.1.1 a non-exclusive, worldwide licence for the Contract Period to load the Content on to its server and use, reproduce, transmit and publicly display it on the GNM Platforms in accordance with this Agreement and the Publication Limits; and 2.1.2 the perpetual right to authorise the Newspaper Licensing Agency and similar reprographic rights organisations in other jurisdictions (\"RROs\") to distribute or license the distribution of the Content for the RROs' licensed acts and purposes as amended from time to time; and 2.1.3 an irrevocable and permanent worldwide licence subject to Clause 4 to (i) store the Content in internal archives; and (ii) publish and transmit the Content on the GNM Platforms after the Contract Period only in the same form and context, and to the extent, that such Content has been reproduced on the GNM Platforms during the Contract Period in accordance with this Agreement. 2.2 The parties shall discuss in good faith the procedure for the supply of the Content from Partner to GNM. GNM agrees not to publish any Content until it has confirmation that the Partner has sufficient rights in the Content. 2.3 GNM may change the headline and standfirst and add pictures and captions to the Content. In addition, GNM may make changes to the Content for legal and style reasons. 2.4 GNM shall publish a credit alongside each item of the Content as follows: [Author] for [Partner], part of the [GNM Content Network] 3. Logos and Credits 3.1 GNM shall display the Partner Logo on the GNM Platforms in form supplied by the Partner. The Partner shall retain all right, title and interest in and to its name, logo and trade marks worldwide. 3.2 The Partner shall display the GNM Logo in the form supplied by GNM on the front page of the Partner Website. GNM shall retain all right, title and interest in and to its name, logo and trade marks worldwide 4. Display and Removal of Content 4.1 GNM shall not be under any obligation to display the Content. 4.2 Partner shall inform GNM if there is a legal issue or complaint concerning any of the Content published on the GNM Platforms pursuant to this Agreement as soon as possible. 5. Revenues &amp; Payments 5.1 Where a share of net advertising revenues (\"SONAR\") is agreed, the SONAR shall be based on: 5.1.1 the page impressions that the Content receives on the Guardian network of websites (\"Website\"); 5.1.2 the net revenues received by GNM at the prevailing CPM rate for the respective month of the Term where 5.1.2.1 \"CPM\" means the cost to advertisers of GNM serving 1,000 ad impressions; and 5.1.2.2 \"Net Revenues\" means revenues from advertisers throughout the world in relation to advertisements that are received by GNM, less advertiser/agency discounts, ad serving costs and any applicable duties or taxes. 5.2 On a monthly basis in arrears over the Term GNM shall provide to Partner reports on page impressions on the Website, unique users on the Website and Net Revenues for the Content. GNM shall pay the Partner the SONAR within 30 days of the end of each calendar month of the Term unless the SONAR owing is less than GBP 20.00 in which event the SONAR shall be carried over to the following month(s) until such time as the SONAR reaches GBP 20.00 in aggregate. 5.3 GNM shall be responsible for selling advertising on the Content. No SONAR shall be payable in respect of: 5.3.1 house advertisements which may be published on occasion; and 5.3.2 cancelled or rejected advertisements, regardless of the time and method of rejection or cancellation. 5.4 GNM reserves the right to grant any discounts to advertisers for network advertisements and for setting the rates for any other advertisements. 5.5 GNM's policies on payment as set out here are incorporated into this Agreement and shall apply to all payments pertaining to this Agreement. 6. Status of Contributors and Suppliers as Independent Contractors 6.1 Partner undertakes any and all engagements under this Agreement as an independent contractor and on the basis that a) its agreement to provide Content to GNM shall not be interpreted or construed to create an association, agency, joint venture, partnership or employer-employee relationship between Partner and GNM or to impose any liability attributable to such a relationship upon either party, including but not limited to GNM's Sickness Policy and paid leave; and b) Partner agrees that it shall work from its own premises in providing services to GNM and shall provide all the necessary equipment and materials to enable it to fulfil the terms of its engagement. 6.2 For the avoidance of doubt, Partner is not a \"worker\" as defined under the Working Time Regulations 1998 (as amended from time to time), and therefore you acknowledge that the provisions in those regulations relating to hours of work, rest breaks and annual leave do not apply to Partner. 6.3 Partner confirms for the purposes of the Taxes Acts, or such other appropriate legislation, that it is a self-employed person in business in its own right and it shall be responsible for all tax liabilities arising in respect of its engagement under this Agreement, and shall itself account to the appropriate authorities for all tax, National Insurance or similar contributions payable in respect of the provision of its services to GNM under this Agreement. Partner undertakes to advise GNM immediately in writing in the event that its self-employed status is challenged by HM Revenue &amp; Customs or any other taxing authority. 6.4 In the event that GNM or any of its holding, subsidiary, associated or group companies (\"Group\") becomes liable to account to HM Revenue &amp; Customs or any other taxing authority anywhere in the world for any income tax, employee national insurance or any other deduction or withholding required to be made by law (including any interest and/or penalties thereon) arising in respect of payments made or to be made to Partner, Partner undertakes and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless GNM and/or the Group against such tax and national insurance and shall, at the written request of GNM, immediately pay GNM an amount equal to any tax and national insurance paid or payable by GNM or any other company in the Group to HM Revenue &amp; Customs or any other taxing authority. GNM shall be entitled to set off an amount equal to any tax and national insurance or any other deduction or withholding paid by GNM or another Group company to HM Revenue &amp; Customs or any other taxing authority against any monies otherwise payable to Partner. 6.5 For the purpose of these clauses, \"independent contractor\" shall be interpreted (as appropriate) to include all engagements made with GNM via a company or limited company. In such event, the rights of indemnity and disclosure equally shall apply. 7. Confidentiality 7.1 Each party undertakes to use all documents and all technical, commercial, financial and other information which is obtained from the other party in connection with this Agreement, or with the negotiations leading up to it, for the purpose of performing this Agreement, to treat them confidentially and to make them available or disclose them to third parties only so far as it is necessary (i) for the performance of this Agreement; or (ii) as permitted under the Licence to Use in Clause 2; or (iii) to their professional advisers; or (iv) as required by law. Further, each party undertakes not to disclose to any person, without the previous written consent of the other party, the existence of any term of this Agreement, or the existence of any information about any dispute or disagreement between the parties. 7.2 The obligations of confidentiality set out above shall not apply to any documents or information which a party can show: 7.2.1 at the time of its acquisition was in, or at a later date has come into, the public domain, other than following a breach of this Clause 5; or 7.2.2 it knew prior to first disclosure to it by the other party; or 7.2.3 it received independently from a third party with the full right to disclose. 8. Warranties and Exclusion of Liability 8.1 Neither party shall be liable to the other for indirect, special or consequential damages (or any loss of revenue, profits or data) arising in connection with this Agreement or the Content, even if one party has advised the other of the possibility of such damages. 8.2 The Partner warrants and represents that it has all necessary rights in the Content and the Partner Logo to enable GNM to carry out its rights and obligations under this Agreement. 8.3 GNM warrants and represents that it has all necessary rights in the GNM Logo to enable the Partner to carry out its rights and obligations under this Agreement. 9. Termination 9.1 Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other in any of the following events: 9.1.1 if the other party commits any breach of any of the terms of this Agreement and fails to remedy that breach (if capable of remedy) within 7 days after notice from the other party giving full particulars of breach and requiring it to be remedied; or 9.1.2 if any step, action, application or proceeding is taken in relation to the whole or any material part of the other party for a voluntary arrangement or composition or reconstruction of its debts, or winding up, dissolution, administration or receivership (administrative or otherwise) or a threat of the same. 9.2 The Agreement may be terminated by either party, on giving the other 30 days written notice. 9.3 On termination of this Agreement the rights and obligations of the parties shall terminate except that the provisions of Clauses 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 and Clauses 3-4 and 6-7 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. 10. General 10.1 Any notice given under this Agreement shall be in writing to the Contact specified on the Term Sheet or such other Contact as the parties may notify from time to time and may be delivered to the other party or sent by pre-paid post or by email with receipt acknowledged to the address of that party specified in this Agreement or such other address as may be notified under this Agreement by that party from time to time for this purpose. 10.2 The parties do not intend for any third party to have any rights under this Agreement by virtue of the Contracts (Rights or Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise. 10.3 Neither party shall assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the other party's prior written consent. 10.4 This Agreement represents the entire terms agreed between the parties in relation to its subject matter. Any variation to this Agreement must be agreed in writing by the parties. 10.5 Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties. No party shall have the authority to bind the other party or to contract in the name of or create a liability against the other party in any way for any purpose. 10.6 No failure or delay by any party in exercising its rights under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right nor shall any single or partial exercise by either party of any right preclude any further exercise of any other right. 10.7 Each party shall comply with all applicable law including, without limitation, the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. 10.8 If any provision of this Agreement (or part of any provision) is found by any court or other authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall remain unaffected and in force. 10.9 This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales over any claim or matter arising under or in connection with this Agreement.",

Partner undertakes to advise GNM immediately in writing in the event that its self-employed status is challenged by HM Revenue &amp; Customs or any other taxing authority.</p> <p><strong>6.4</strong> In the event that GNM or any of its holding, subsidiary, associated or group companies (\"Group\") becomes liable to account to HM Revenue &amp; Customs or any other taxing authority anywhere in the world for any income tax, employee national insurance or any other deduction or withholding required to be made by law (including any interest and/or penalties thereon) arising in respect of payments made or to be made to Partner, Partner undertakes and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless GNM and/or the Group against such tax and national insurance and shall, at the written request of GNM, immediately pay GNM an amount equal to any tax and national insurance paid or payable by GNM or any other company in the Group to HM Revenue &amp; Customs or any other taxing authority. GNM shall be entitled to set off an amount equal to any tax and national insurance or any other deduction or withholding paid by GNM or another Group company to HM Revenue &amp; Customs or any other taxing authority against any monies otherwise payable to Partner.</p> <p><strong>6.5</strong> For the purpose of these clauses, \"independent contractor\" shall be interpreted (as appropriate) to include all engagements made with GNM via a company or limited company. In such event, the rights of indemnity and disclosure equally shall apply.</p> <h2>7.

      "bodyText": "Britain has entered a fourth year of record low interest rates following the Bank of England's decision to hold borrowing costs. The move comes almost three years to the day after policymakers took rates down to 0.5%, the lowest since the Bank was founded in 1694, and embarked on the process of pumping electronic cash into a shrinking economy. In the face of a sluggish recovery it has gone on to expand that programme of quantitative easing (QE) to \u00a3325bn, going into markets to buy up UK government bonds, known as gilts, and thereby injecting newly printed money into the financial system. Meanwhile interest rates have stayed at the emergency level, defying the initial expectation in the City that the move would be short-lived, with borrowing costs predicted to have risen by early 2010 and reached 3% by 2012. This month's meeting concluded as expected with no change to rates or the QE programme. That followed comments from Bank governor Mervyn King and other policymakers playing down the chances of more money printing. QE has faced criticism for stoking high inflation as well as hurting savers and pensioners. The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) says the downward pressure on gilt yields from the Bank's latest round of buying up the bonds has pushed final salary pension funds \u00a390bn deeper into the red. Pension funds have to calculate their deficits based on gilt yields for regulation purposes. The lobby group argues that the black hole created by QE will have the knock-on effect of forcing businesses to divert money away from jobs and investment and into filling pension fund deficits. But the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee has been divided over how far to take QE and some analysts still believe it could be boosted further. At February's meeting David Miles joined long-standing \"dove\" Adam Posen in voting for a \u00a375bn boost, while the other seven went for a \u00a350bn increase. City economists are now awaiting the minutes from this week's meeting, released in two weeks, to see how the committee voted and to glean clues over whether there will be any further QE. There is less debate in markets over the interest rate outlook, with widespread expectations they will stay at their emergency level until at least next year. One of the UK's leading economic consultancies said this week that rates could remain at 0.5% for a further three years. Capital Economics said the days of ultra-cheap money were here to stay thanks to a backdrop of \"prolonged fiscal consolidation, weak bank lending and a sluggish economic recovery\".",

      "bodyText": "Woody Allen's on-screen appearances are getting rarer and rarer. The last time he appeared in a film was in 2006, when he starred alongside Scarlett Johansson in his own film Scoop. The last time he appeared in someone else's film was back in 2000, when he turned up in Alfonso Arau's Picking Up the Pieces. However, there are signs that this period of hiding is coming to an end. His next film Nero Fiddled might seem like a by-the-numbers latter-period Allen piece \u2013 featuring a classical conceit (it's apparently based on Boccaccio's The Decameron), Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and a nervy young Allen analogue (Jesse Eisenberg) \u2013 but its biggest selling point is that Woody Allen himself will appear in it. What's more, this week it was announced that he'll also star in John Turturro's Fading Gigolo, where he'll play one of the eponymous gigolos alongside Turturro, Sharon Stone and Modern Family's Sofia Vergara. Finally, it seems that Woody Allen is ready to take his place in front of the camera again. This is undoubtedly a good thing. While he's never had the most range as an actor \u2013 you could never see him taking the lead in, say, Twilight or Cowboys and Aliens \u2013 it goes without saying that Woody Allen plays Woody Allen better than anyone else alive. And god knows many have tried. Because, while it's true that Woody Allen can only really play Woody Allen, it's also fairly apparent that he usually writes Woody Allen as well. This means that when he's not on screen, it falls to another actor \u2013 be it Owen Wilson or Larry David or Will Ferrell or Kenneth Branagh \u2013 to do a hamfisted approximation of him. Regardless of how Nero Fiddled turns out, it'll be a pleasure to see all his lines delivered by the original source instead of a stammering interloper. It's not hard to see why he shied away from these roles, though. As a director, Allen's forte is love and the human condition. It's just that it's not always age-appropriate love, and films like Mighty Aphrodite proved that there's nothing creepier than watching an old man seduce a young girl - even without the context of Allen's real-life travails. Perhaps starring in a film called Fading Gigolos is his way of slyly addressing this problem. Plus, thankfully, both Nero Fiddled and Fading Gigolo are being billed as comedies, so hopefully we'll get to see the Woody Allen that everyone likes. Not the recent interview subject Woody Allen \u2013 the quietly depressive figure who lives in the shadows, ruminates mournfully on the futility of it all and regards his own films with a mixture of ambivalence and disdain \u2013 but the snappy, charismatic Woody Allen of old. It's hard to watch the opening of Annie Hall, or the sperm scene from Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask, or any of Sleeper, or even his old standup routines from the 1960s without longing for a return of that Woody Allen. Even when he wasn't reading from his own script, in films like Martin Ritt's The Front or even Antz, he was never anything other than an engaging presence. And now, perhaps, we'll get a glimmer of it again. That's a long shot, of course. Don't forget that the mind-numbingly dreadful Scoop was also billed as a comedy, and there can't be too many fans of Picking Up the Pieces around either. Perhaps the idea of seeing Woody Allen on screen again is better than the reality of seeing Woody Allen on screen again. We'll have to wait and see. But, you have to admit, it's a nice idea.",

      "bodyText": "It was inevitable, after several weeks of being the biggest story in American sports, New York Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin's production has fallen back down to earth, as has the media hype and his team's recent record. Subjects such as Peyton Manning, the Saints' bounty system and the NCAA College Basketball Tournament have knocked him off the front of the sports pages. That's almost a metaphor for the NBA in March, where fans are distracted by (among other things) March Madness brackets, fantasy baseball drafts and offseason NFL headlines. This is understandable but something of a shame, because this is when the playoff races become more heated, the storylines gets stranger, and the March 15 trade deadline threatens to alter pro basketball's entire landscape. 1. 5 Things We Learned About President Obama This Week President Barack Obama appeared with ESPN's Bill Simmons on his BS Report podcast. During the interview, he gave his opinion on a wide variety of matters ranging from his favorite \"Wire\" character (Omar) to the need for college football to have a playoff system. This is, of course, an election year, so I decided to examine the president's thoughts about the NBA and how they could affect his run for re-election. . i. President Obama Knew About Jeremy Lin Before We Did What he said: \"I knew about Jeremy Lin before you did, or everybody else did, because Arne Duncan, my secretary of education, was captain of the Harvard team\u2026 He said, we've got this terrific guard named Jeremy Lin at Harvard.\" Ramifications: Barack Obama is clearly going for the hipster vote here, admitting that he knew about Jeremy Lin before anybody else. This move could backfire as opponents could use this quote to apply the \"elitist\" tag on him. In the future, I'd recommend the president downplay the whole Harvard thing as well unless the school happens to make an underdog run in this year's NCAA Tournament. ii. President Obama Likes His Chicago Bulls What he said: \"The Heat are playing better than anybody right now\u2026 But during the playoffs things slow down a little bit, and you got to run a half-court offense, and in that situation, I think the Bulls got a shot.\" Ramifications: It would seem President Obama is safe here by subtly rooting against the Miami Heat, but he has to be careful not to alienate voters in Southeast Florida too much. The last time a Democratic presidential candidate had some issues in that area, it took months to resolve. America doesn't need to go through that again. iii. President Obama Wasn't Going To Intervene In the NBA Lockout What he said: \"I just had to assume that at some point they'd work it out. My whole theory \u2013 it's the same way with the NFL lockout. If you've got billionaires on one side and millionaires on another, you guys can figure out how to divide some money up.\" Ramifications: On one hand, Obama is courting the Tea Party crowd here by making a solid case against government intervention. On the other hand, the \"billionaires and millionaires\" line might sound dangerously close to code words for \"class warfare\". iv. President Obama Got One Over On Chris Paul What he said: \"I had my own little All-Star Game here\u2026 Chris (Paul) was one of the guys who played. And I did a little crossover on him. He claims that he could have stolen the ball. Everybody who was there knows that that's not true.\" Ramifications: Okay, this is mostly likely a lie, but as far as presidential lies go, it's pretty tame. President Clinton's story would probably have ended with a monster slam dunk over Dwight Howard. President Nixon would have denied the game ever took place. v. President Obama Believes Michael Jordan Is the Greatest Basketball Player Ever What he said: \"You got to go with Jordan\u2026 You've never had a combination of talent and fierce will to win and longevity and rising to the occasion.\" Ramifications: If President Obama had answered with the name of any other NBA player, I believe that would be grounds for impeachment. 2. Dwight Howard And Rajon Rondo Will Or Will Not Get Traded Trade deadlines in sports usually involve weeks of speculation, negotiation and inaction, which is then followed either by a flurry of last-minute transactions or a mere handful of minor moves. Last year's deadline was all about the Nuggets' Carmelo Anthony, who eventually was traded to the Knicks. This year's NBA trade deadline is all about Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. Some days it seems clear that Howard wants to leave Orlando for a bigger market, but he also hasn't fully closed the door on resigning with the Magic. That slight possibly is enough to make the Magic, knowing that they would be losing their marquee superstar without getting equal value in return, hesitant to trade him, especially as there aren't many realistic suitors right now. One of Howard's preferred destinations is Brooklyn, via New Jersey, but the Magic would want a healthy Brook Lopez from the Nets, and the center just got hurt for the second time this season. Howard would also want to be traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, who presumably would offer a package featuring All-Star center Andrew Bynum, but nobody in the league seems to know exactly what the Lakers, who may also be shopping Pau Gasol, are trying to accomplish this season. The other big name that may, or may not, be on the trading block is Boston Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo. Reports have suggested that Celtics GM Danny Ainge has been \"aggressively shopping\" the talented yet inconsistent Rondo. Rondo responded to these rumors by putting together maybe the best game of his NBA career, an overtime victory against the Knicks where he put up 18 points, 20 assists and 17 rebounds (watch here). Earlier in the year, Ainge had proposed a deal with the New Orleans Hornets that would have traded Rondo as part of a deal for Chris Paul, but unless there's a deal out there that would get a player of similar caliber, expect Rondo to remain a Celtic at least until the offseason. In the meantime, half of Boston will be yelling at Danny Ainge to \"blow the team up\", while the other half will echo Hall of Famer Bob Cousy's line \"unless he's a serial killer on the side I wouldn't let this kid go\". 3. The Curse Of Clipper Darrell? I've briefly touched on the recent plight of Clipper Darrell before, but the story of this oddball superfan deserves a follow-up. Last week, the Los Angeles Clippers told Darrell Bailey that he could no longer call himself \"Clipper Darrell\". At first, this seemed like a classic Clippers move: ownership was abandoning and betraying their biggest fan at the very moment their team was becoming relevant. The incident looked like reviled owner Donald Sterling's latest act of needless cruelty. Even Clippers players, via soon deleted Tweets, expressed support for the L.A. fixture. The story, however, is more complicated than that. L.A. Times columnist Bill Plaschke presented the Clippers' side of the story with more clarity than the organization's initial, rude press release. The Clippers, who had been paying for Bailey's seats for years, were concerned because he had been participating in paid events using the \"Clippers\" brand without permission. They made attempts to bring him in as an official employee, efforts which apparently stalled. Only when the two sides failed to agree to terms did the Clippers ask Bailey to stop calling himself \"Clipper Darrell\". As painful as it is to admit it, Plaschke's column raises some reasonable points. The team can't just let an unaffiliated person pass himself off as their ambassador, and, if it's true that the Clippers attempted to make his position official, Bailey has been a bit disingenuous with the media. Still, the Clippers handled this issue poorly by only addressing it once the team's popularity began peaking. If the Clippers had dealt with this issue before the rise of Blake Griffin and the Chris Paul trade, the whole affair would seem less callous. Watching this interview with Darrell where he literally breaks down in front of the camera raises further questions. Certainly his behavior could be just another part of his eccentric act, but it seems likely that the Clippers' legal team has been trying to play hardball with someone who may not be entirely all there. Heck, the fact that Bailey's been a Clippers fan for over a decade raises that possibility. However it plays out, this incident has taken public focus off an enjoyable team and diverted it back to its little loved owner and that can't be good for the Clippers. The Clippers have been playing inconsistent of late, and if that continues inevitably someone will propose the idea of the Curse Of Clipper Darrell. I wouldn't put too much stock in the concept though, how could anyone curse a franchise that has never been successful in the first place? 4. Kobe Was That Masked Man After Dwyane Wade broke his nose during the All-Star Game, Lakers guard Kobe Bryant became the latest of a long line of NBA star players to wear that icon of ballplayer toughness: The plastic mask. Many players, most notably current Chicago Bull Richard Hamilton, have worn plastic masks to protect their noses from re-injury while also providing subtle on-court intimidation. Leave it to Kobe to take the standard clear plastic mask and take it one more step into the cartoonish by wearing a custom-made black Kato-like mask early during a game against the Detroit Pistons. A few fans, presumably not from Colorado, attempted to give Kobe the entirely unsuitable nickname \"Crime Fighter\" when \"Vigilante\", or perhaps \"Anti-Hero\", would be somewhat more fitting. As a long time comic book geek, I strongly encourage Kobe not to give up and demand more elaborate, personalized masks. I would love to see Kobe wearing Batman's cowl, Cyclops's visor or Hawkman's elaborate headgear on the court. After all, it's well known that pro athletes are a cowardly, superstitious lot. 5. Other Things We've Learned \u2022 Player of the Week: On Sunday, the New Jersey Nets' Deron Williams scored a franchise high 57 points, which is incredibly impressive even if it was against the Charlotte Bobcats. \u2022 In heartbreaking news for this blog, Roland Lazenby did some research and found that Lakers' scout Chaz Osbourne is not, in fact, a bartender. Well, he'll always be Chaz the Bartender to me. \u2022 The LeBron James Can't Win Department: This is getting ridiculous. After critics accused LeBron James of choking away an All-Star Game, it seemed like the \"LeBron James Isn't Clutch\" narrative couldn't get any more ridiculous, and then came Friday night. After LeBron James scored 17 points in the fourth quarter, including two three-point shots in the final minute, a double-covered James passed to a wide open Udonis Haslem who missed his last-second shot. As Deadspin's Sam Newell put it \"the argument (against LeBron) goes like this: 'It was the right basketball play, but I would like to see LeBron take that shot\". The relentless media criticism against LeBron has reached such a point that he could potentially start rebranding himself as a hapless underdog in the midst of a MVP season. I blame Skip Bayless.",

Subjects such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/mar/07/peyton-manning-indianapolis-colts-super-bowl\">Peyton Manning</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/mar/02/new-orleans-saints-bounty-program-injury\">the Saints' bounty system</a> and <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/champweek2012/story/_/id/7657002/big-ten-tournament-primer-expect-indianapolis\">the NCAA College Basketball Tournament</a> have knocked him off the front of the sports pages. That's almost a metaphor for the NBA in March, where fans are distracted by (among other things) <a href=\"http://www.ncaa.com/march-madness\">March Madness brackets</a>, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/fantasy/fb/info/index.jsp\">fantasy baseball drafts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/mar/06/nfl-best-free-agents-agency-deals-2012\">offseason NFL headlines</a>. This is understandable but something of a shame, because this is when the playoff races become more heated, the storylines gets stranger, and the March 15 trade deadline threatens to alter pro basketball's entire landscape.</p> <h2>1. 5 Things We Learned About President Obama This Week</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/18687/b-s-report-barack-obama\">President Barack Obama appeared with ESPN's Bill Simmons on his BS Report podcast</a>. During the interview, he gave his opinion on a wide variety of matters ranging from his favorite \"Wire\" character (Omar) to the need for college football to have a playoff system. This is, of course, an election year, so I decided to examine the president's thoughts about the NBA and how they could affect his run for re-election.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7znJyJ0dewk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7znJyJ0dewk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.<br>i. <strong>President Obama Knew About Jeremy Lin Before We Did</strong><br><em>What he said:</em> \"I knew about Jeremy Lin before you did, or everybody else did, because Arne Duncan, my secretary of education, was captain of the Harvard team\u2026 He said, we've got this terrific guard named Jeremy Lin at Harvard.\"</p> <p><em>Ramifications:</em> Barack Obama is clearly going for the hipster vote here, admitting that he knew about Jeremy Lin before anybody else. This move could backfire as opponents could use this quote to apply the \"elitist\" tag on him. In the future, I'd recommend the president downplay the whole Harvard thing as well unless the school happens to make an underdog run in this year's NCAA Tournament.</p> <p>ii. <strong>President Obama Likes His Chicago Bulls</strong><br><em>What he said:</em> \"The Heat are playing better than anybody right now\u2026 But during the playoffs things slow down a little bit, and you got to run a half-court offense, and in that situation, I think the Bulls got a shot.\"</p> <p><em>Ramifications:</em> It would seem President Obama is safe here by subtly rooting against the Miami Heat, but he has to be careful not to alienate voters in Southeast Florida too much. The last time a Democratic presidential candidate had some issues in that area, it took months to resolve. America doesn't need to go through that again.</p> <p>iii. <strong>President Obama Wasn't Going To Intervene In the NBA Lockout</strong><br><em>What he said:</em> \"I just had to assume that at some point they'd work it out. My whole theory \u2013 it's the same way with the NFL lockout. If you've got billionaires on one side and millionaires on another, you guys can figure out how to divide some money up.\"</p> <p><em>Ramifications:</em> On one hand, Obama is courting the Tea Party crowd here by making a solid case against government intervention. On the other hand, the \"billionaires and millionaires\" line might sound dangerously close to code words for \"class warfare\".</p> <p>iv. <strong>President Obama Got One Over On Chris Paul</strong><br><em>What he said:</em> \"I had my own little All-Star Game here\u2026 Chris (Paul) was one of the guys who played. And I did a little crossover on him. He claims that he could have stolen the ball. Everybody who was there knows that that's not true.\"</p> <p><em>Ramifications:</em> Okay, this is mostly likely a lie, but as far as presidential lies go, it's pretty tame. President Clinton's story would probably have ended with a monster slam dunk over Dwight Howard. President Nixon would have denied the game ever took place.</p> <p>v. <strong>President Obama Believes Michael Jordan Is the Greatest Basketball Player Ever</strong><br><em>What he said:</em> \"You got to go with Jordan\u2026 You've never had a combination of talent and fierce will to win and longevity and rising to the occasion.\"</p> <p><em>Ramifications:</em> If President Obama had answered with the name of any other NBA player, I believe that would be grounds for impeachment.</p> <h2>2. Dwight Howard And Rajon Rondo Will Or Will Not Get Traded</h2> <p>Trade deadlines in sports usually involve weeks of speculation, negotiation and inaction, which is then followed either by a flurry of last-minute transactions or a mere handful of minor moves.

      "bodyText": "For about four decades now, rediscovering and promoting the work of women writers deemed to have been \"abandoned\" by readers has been a staple of the literary feminist. It is the raison d'\u00eatre of the publishing house Virago, which has brought us many books that would have otherwise been long forgotten. So it was interesting to read Sarah Waters's piece lamenting the \"neglect\" of Sylvia Townsend Warner \u2013 but it annoyed me, too. Townsend Warner, who has had six of her novels republished by Virago, hardly qualifies for inclusion on the \"missing\" list. There are many other women writers who remain entirely overlooked, and whom present readers would doubtless enjoy and learn from. And one candidate worthy of being fished from the seas of oblivion and dragged into the literary lifeboat is Ethel Carnie Holdsworth. I fear the reason why Carnie Holdsworth hasn't yet proved an attractive prospect for the missionary feminist is that she was trenchantly working class. Carnie Holdsworth wrote stories for and about other working-class women; women who, like herself, were already working long hours in factories and at home. With no allowance to free up her time, nor a high level of education, she had an urgent need to show how it was for herself and women like her. It's a very old plough, this; the absence of, and then, when she is there, the neglect of, the working-class woman. One of the reasons I am championing Carnie Holdsworth is because we share class origins; origins that make one only too aware of how hard it is to even realise that one could have a voice through the pen. But that's not all: a survey of Carnie Holdsworth's work makes all too clear her struggle and her significant achievements, which, in the end, wore her out. Carnie Holdsworth was born in Lancashire in 1886, and her father often took her to socialist meetings. It was not enough to keep her, at age 11, from taking a part-time job in a textiles factory, going full-time two years later. She started writing poetry, using her factory-girl status as a marketing tool \u2013 although the poetry itself was abstract, concerned with beauty and happiness, as though keen to demonstrate that those in factories were also capable of what were seen as the finer feelings. It was enough to attract the attention of Robert Blatchford, a founder of the Clarion movement and the Independent Labour party, who offered her a job writing on his London-based magazine the Woman Worker. If he thought Carnie Holdsworth would stick to penning harmless abstractions, however, he was wrong. Her journalism, like the novels she would go on to write, was concerned with working-class socialist feminism. She stayed in the job just seven months; her role was then filled by Blatchford's daughter, and the magazine renamed Women Folk. The nepotism and the name change, reflecting a more genteel approach, suggest that Carnie Holdsworth was ruffling feathers simply by writing about what she had come from and using her new public voice to tell working-class women to \"go out and play\". After her foray into journalism, Carnie Holdsworth returned to Lancashire and decided poetry no longer met her expressive needs. She combined the writing of her first novel, Miss Nobody (1913), with shop work and attending lectures at Manchester's Owens College. Over the next 20 years, she wrote 10 novels, and also set up and edited the Clear Light, an anti-fascist journal that was ahead of its time. But at just 46 she stopped novel-writing. Her daughter later reported to labour historian Ruth Frow that Ethel had felt \"worn out\" by them. Why? The novel, a native medium for middle-class writers such as Townsend Warner, had long been a struggle for a woman who was trying to find ways of expressing the lives of those around her. The form had risen with the birth of the middle-class and had been overwhelmingly used to chart their concerns. It was the critic Raymond Williams who found that, for the working classes, \"the novel, with its quite different narrative forms, was virtually impenetrable for three or four generations\". Sensing this, Carnie Holdsworth attempted to create a new form, using what I see as a mix of the New Woman and the Chartist novels, wedded to auto/biography \u2013 or even journalism. Her work cannot be categorised as romance; in fact, the difficulty of categorising her work at all may explain her neglect. Personally, I think it is best defined as autobiografiction. The topic was recently taken up by Max Saunders, but, typically, for the middle-class modernist cause, even though the definition was first used for The Poor Man's House by Stephen Reynolds in 1912 \u2013 another case of attention being usurped from working-class literary heritage. What we need more than ever in our current climate are works that reflect these levels of inequality \u2013 not just between men and women, but between women and women \u2013 and north and south. I have often found it ironic that the feminists who cry foul at patriarchal cultural imperialism and the championing of male writers at the expense of better women, then go on to repeat the process among women along class lines, whether they know it or not. There is some good news for Carnie Holdsworth though. Nicola Wilson is giving a talk at the Manchester Working Class Movement Library on Saturday 10 March, in celebration of International Women's Day, which will take in the publication of her 1925 novel, This Slavery. Now is a great time to reappraise this woman's work. As for Townsend Warner, I suspect her work will live on regardless.",

And one candidate worthy of being fished from the seas of oblivion and dragged into the literary lifeboat is <a href=\"http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?language=eng&amp;pageID=4630\" title=\"\">Ethel Carnie Holdsworth</a>.</p> <p>I fear the reason why Carnie Holdsworth hasn't yet proved an attractive prospect for the missionary feminist is that she was trenchantly working class. Carnie Holdsworth wrote stories for and about other working-class women; women who, like herself, were already working long hours in factories and at home. With no allowance to free up her time, nor a high level of education, she had an urgent need to show how it was for herself and women like her. It's a very old plough, this; the absence of, and then, when she is there, the neglect of, the working-class woman. One of the reasons I am championing Carnie Holdsworth is because we share class origins; origins that make one only too aware of how hard it is to even realise that one could have a voice through the pen. But that's not all: a survey of Carnie Holdsworth's work makes all too clear her struggle and her significant achievements, which, in the end, wore her out.</p> <p>Carnie Holdsworth was born in Lancashire in 1886, and her father often took her to socialist meetings. It was not enough to keep her, at age 11, from taking a part-time job in a textiles factory, going full-time two years later. She started writing poetry, using her factory-girl status as a marketing tool \u2013 although the poetry itself was abstract, concerned with beauty and happiness, as though keen to demonstrate that those in factories were also capable of what were seen as the finer feelings. It was enough to attract the attention of Robert Blatchford, a founder of <a href=\"http://radicalmanchester.wordpress.com/2010/08/11/the-clarion-movement/\" title=\"\">the Clarion movement</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.independentlabour.org.uk/main/history/\" title=\"\">Independent Labour party</a>, who offered her a job writing on his London-based magazine the Woman Worker. If he thought Carnie Holdsworth would stick to penning harmless abstractions, however, he was wrong. Her journalism, like the novels she would go on to write, was concerned with working-class socialist feminism.</p> <p>She stayed in the job just seven months; her role was then filled by Blatchford's daughter, and the magazine renamed Women Folk. The nepotism and the name change, reflecting a more genteel approach, suggest that Carnie Holdsworth was ruffling feathers simply by writing about what she had come from and using her new public voice to tell working-class women to \"go out and play\".</p> <p>After her foray into journalism, Carnie Holdsworth returned to Lancashire and decided poetry no longer met her expressive needs. She combined the writing of her first novel, Miss Nobody (1913), with shop work and attending lectures at Manchester's Owens College. Over the next 20 years, she wrote 10 novels, and also set up and edited the Clear Light, an anti-fascist journal that was ahead of its time. But at just 46 she stopped novel-writing. Her daughter later reported to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/feb/01/labour.uk\" title=\"\">labour historian Ruth Frow</a> that Ethel had felt \"worn out\" by them. Why?</p> <p>The novel, a native medium for middle-class writers such as Townsend Warner, had long been a struggle for a woman who was trying to find ways of expressing the lives of those around her. The form had risen with the birth of the middle-class and had been overwhelmingly used to chart their concerns. It was the critic Raymond Williams who found that, for the working classes, \"the novel, with its quite different narrative forms, was virtually impenetrable for three or four generations\".</p> <p>Sensing this, Carnie Holdsworth attempted to create a new form, using what I see as a mix of the New Woman and the Chartist novels, wedded to auto/biography \u2013 or even journalism. Her work cannot be categorised as romance; in fact, the difficulty of categorising her work at all may explain her neglect. Personally, I think it is best defined as <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ip/maxsaunders/ABF/index.htm\" title=\"\">autobiografiction</a>. The topic was recently taken up by <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ip/maxsaunders/\" title=\"\">Max Saunders</a>, but, typically, for the middle-class modernist cause, even though <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ip/maxsaunders/ABF/Reynoldsscans.htm\" title=\"\">the definition was first used for The Poor Man's House by Stephen Reynolds in 1912</a> \u2013 another case of attention being usurped from working-class literary heritage.</p> <p>What we need more than ever in our current climate are works that reflect these levels of inequality \u2013 not just between men and women, but between women and women \u2013 and north and south. I have often found it ironic that the feminists who cry foul at patriarchal cultural imperialism and the championing of male writers at the expense of better women, then go on to repeat the process among women along class lines, whether they know it or not.</p> <p>There is some good news for Carnie Holdsworth though. <a href=\"http://www.salford.gov.uk/internationalwomensday2012.htm\" title=\"\">Nicola Wilson is giving a talk at the Manchester Working Class Movement Library</a> on Saturday 10 March, in celebration of International Women's Day, which will take in the publication of her 1925 novel, <a href=\"http://neglectedbooks.com/?p=133\" title=\"\">This Slavery</a>. Now is a great time to reappraise this woman's work. As for Townsend Warner, I suspect her work will live on regardless.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the most talked about books of last year emerges this month in paperback. Caitlin Moran's How to Be a Woman (Ebury), her scabrously funny engagement with modern feminism, won book of the year at the Galaxy awards. \"I was expecting to find some tension between the dual purposes of memoir and polemic in Moran's book,\" wrote Zoe Willams, \"but in fact, every word of the memoir is loaded with political importance.\" These words include mention of the unexpected erotic potential of Chevy Chase to a Wolverhampton teenager, as well as an update on practical feminist theory from Germaine Greer. But what makes the book important is something unique to Moran, continued Williams. \"She and Greer have both attacked the elemental shame attached to being a woman, but where Greer was furious, Moran sloughs it off with exuberance. There is a courage in this book that is born, not made, and not borrowed, either. It is vital in both senses.\" To show that there can be prizes for all, another winner \u2013 this time of the Costa best biography \u2013 was Matthew Hollis's study of the poet Edward Thomas, Now All Roads Lead to France (Faber). We often think of Thomas as \"a pastoral poet of place and belonging, but his real subjects were disconnection, discrepancy and unsettledness\", observed reviewer Robert Macfarlane. Thomas came late to poetry and in his lifetime he was better known as one of London's most powerful critics, \"notorious for the sharpness of his pen\". Hollis restores this largely forgotten aspect of Thomas's career before subtly dealing with his personal and professional relationship with the American poet Robert Frost and his fateful decision to enlist in the Great War. \"The war saved Thomas before it killed him,\" says Macfarlane. \"It gave him purpose and, obliquely, it gave him poetry.\" Hollis's fine book helps us to understand how much more there is to Thomas than willow-herb and meadowsweet and haycocks dry. There is more emblematic plant life in Richard Mabey's Weeds: The Story of Outlaw Plants (Profile). Reviewer Andrew Motion describes Mabey as \"the steward of a pastoral tradition in which highly personal responses to landscape are matched by expert environmental concern.\" Following on from his three co-authored Britannica books (Birds, Flora and Bugs), Mabey now turns his attention to Weeds. Taking his starter question as \"what is a weed?\" \u2013 \"The usual answer is 'a flower in the wrong place'\" \u2013 he follows the story of weeds from the Book of Genesis onwards, taking in the great herbals (Gerard, Culpepper), D\u00fcrer's Large Piece of Turf (1503), A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Day of the Triffids, which makes for an alarming ending to a resourceful book without overthrowing its presiding mood of celebration. The idea of gardening as political act underpins Andrea Wulf's The Founding Gardeners: How the Revolutionary Generation Created an American Eden (Windmill, \u00a38.99). When the founding fathers of post-revolutionary America returned to their estates after eight years of war, they set out to make gardens that were American and revolutionary \u2013 defiantly not British \u2013 thus staging a second rebellion that was not only aesthetic and botanical but political and economic. Reviewer Katherine Swift praised this \"engrossing\" study that takes in a period of about 40 years, interweaving political life with events at home as each strove to express their political ideals through garden-making. George Washington at Mount Vernon, John Adams on his farm at Quincy, Thomas Jefferson in Palladian splendour at Monticello, and James Madison at Montpelier. So important was horticulture to these men that at the end of his career, Jefferson, thinking back over his achievements, \"included his successful introduction of upland rice to Georgia and Kentucky on the same list as the Declaration of Independence\". With the 2012 Formula One season about to start a timely publication of No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone, by Tom Bower (Faber, \u00a38.99). As reviewer Richard Williams noted: \"Men who bluff and bully their way to enormous fortunes are Tom Bower's special subject, so it was probably inevitable that Bernie Ecclestone, the billionaire ringmaster of Formula One, would one day wander into his authorial cross-hairs.\" This was a book \"which had been expected, on Bower's past form, to contain more explosive revelations than turns out to be the case.\" But that said, there are still telling insights into Ecclestone's life and career and it comes as no surprise that, even now in his 80s, Ecclestone knows how to turn a buck. He was recently mugged outside his home and a \u00a325,000 watch was among items snatched by thieves. A few days after the incident the watch's manufacturer took out a newspaper advertisement showing his badly bruised face next to the slogan: \"See what some people will do for a Hublot\".",

      "bodyText": "When England defeated Australia in the autumn of November 2010, playing with pace and an element of risk, Ben Youngs was the catalyst. The Leicester scrum-half looked for space and helped his side play with a flow that suggested, for the first time under Martin Johnson, they would be among the contenders for the World Cup. In the opening two games of the 2011 Six Nations, his club half-back partner, Toby Flood, was influential, breaking the defence in a tight opener against Wales and then running from everywhere against Italy, kicking only once out of hand during the rout at Twickenham. Flood will not be at the Stade de France on Sunday. Injury forced him to miss the start of the Six Nations, but when his replacement, Charlie Hodgson, was himself ruled out after scoring England's two tries in their opening games, Owen Farrell was given the No10 jersey against Wales at Twickenham with Flood only making the bench. Now Hodgson is fit, Flood has returned to Leicester. Youngs will be among the replacements in Paris after losing his place against Wales to Lee Dickson, who fully justified his selection while Youngs struggled to make an impact after coming on with 20 minutes to go. The Leicester head coach Matt O'Connor this week rounded on the England interim head coach Stuart Lancaster, accusing him of not wanting creative players and coaching his players not to lose. \"There is nothing I have seen so far in the Six Nations that indicates England want to go out and beat teams,\" he said. \"Under the current structure, I cannot see that changing. If you are talking about building a side for the World Cup in 2015, you have to go out and play.\" A coach defending his players is hardly surprising, and there is an implicit criticism of the club that defeated Leicester in last season's Premiership final, Saracens, in O'Connor's words \u2013 given the influence the champions have in England's back division with Owen Farrell, Brad Barritt, David Strettle and, from the summer, Chris Ashton. But England declined in terms of creativity after the victory over Italy last year and the end of that Six Nations, when England collapsed against Ireland in Dublin, marked Youngs's then low point in a white jersey. It was also an evening during which Flood struggled and the World Cup repaired the reputation of neither player. In that context, they were on the ebb before Lancaster took over. Lancaster picked Youngs in Scotland and Italy, which he may not have done had Danny Care been available, but the scrum-half looked a shell of the player who had so tormented the Wallabies, someone who perhaps needs his club environment to recapture his form because his international career still has some way to run. He has lost his form, not his talent. Opponents had become alert to him, even if England's habit of using slow forwards off nine, a feature of the World Cup, did little to take advantage of Youngs's attacking instincts. Edinburgh and Rome were matches in which England set out not to lose, but were they ever going to be occasions when Lancaster sent out his players to be gung-ho? The limited time he had to work with the squad, two away fixtures to start with and lousy weather conditions meant that England, perforce, were going to be organised and structured rather than free-flowing. It takes far less time for a new management team to work on defence than it does to polish an attack. Defeat against either Scotland or Italy would have left England on the back foot ahead of their toughest fixtures, Wales, France and Ireland. Their hard-fought victories rebuilt a spirit that had been fractured by the goings-on in New Zealand and gave the players the confidence to take the game to Wales. O'Connor is being uncharitable when he says England have not tried to beat anyone. After an uncertain opening quarter, they took the game to Wales and the centres, who included Leicester's Manu Tuilagi, covered more than 10 times the ground with the ball in hand than the midfield had managed at Murrayfield. There was a clear progression in terms of England's gameplan. They failed to score a try, Tuilagi denied by one of the tackles of the tournament as Sam Warburton cut him down at the moment the centre anticipated scoring, and Strettle defied by the video referee Iain Ramage after the last move of the match. From the press eyrie, it looked as if Strettle had applied downward pressure but not one of the camera angles Ramage looked at confirmed that impression. Interestingly, it appears there was another angle, not provided at the time, which backs up Strettle's contention that he had scored. That is to digress, but England did far more against Wales than soak up pressure. It was Wales who pulled off a smash-and-grab and their players and coaches have spent the last 11 days saying how impressed they had been with England as an attacking force. The task for them now is to continue to progress against France and Ireland. O'Connor's remarks should be taken a step further. What lead does the Aviva Premiership offer the England head coach? Is not the mentality of most sides not to lose? Leicester are as pragmatic a team as any, very often playing a narrow game. The former England coach Brian Ashton remarked recently, when talking about how teams shape their attacking strategy, that the mentality in the Premiership, and he cited Harlequins and Gloucester as possible exceptions, was to set targets for forwards to hit and get over the gainline as quickly as possible. \"Other countries, particularly Down Under, use the principle of go forward to attack the gainline, not as an end in itself but as a means of breaking the tackle line or offloading the ball, keeping the move alive and dynamic,\" he went on. England are hardly where they want to be but under Lancaster and his coaches they have shown vital signs. It may not be enough to secure him the position permanently, with the RFU seemingly fixated on a name known throughout the rugby world, but a team that seemed at war with itself only a month ago looks able to fight its way above the Premiership norm. O'Connor may reflect on the statistics produced after the first three rounds of the Six Nations in the wake of his observations about England. Statistics, of course, can be used either way and no side has scored fewer tries than England, whose two have come from Charlie Hodgson chargedowns. Even Scotland have managed three. England have made the fewest passes, 382, not much more than half the number compiled by the team who have moved the ball on the most, 704, a side which has also made the most line-breaks and won the ball the most times in an opponent's 22. The side is not Wales, the Six Nations leaders, nor is it France, their main rivals for the title. And it is not Ireland, who will be denied a tilt for the championship before they face Scotland on Saturday if Wales defeat Italy in Cardiff. The team is Scotland, who for all their attacking intent and territorial gains are still looking for their first victory. They have gone out to play but they have not won. Would O'Connor be any more impressed by England were they occupying Scotland's position in the table? The strength of any side, as Leicester have shown down the years, is that it knows what it is about and does not pretend to be something it is not. England under Lancaster are maximising their chances of winning. The fun comes later. Beating the timewasters One feature of the Six Nations seems to be that a tackled player is being given longer to release the ball. Penalties for holding on used to be awarded with alacrity if a tackle to the ground was not followed by instant release. It is not the result of any directive by the International Rugby Board, merely something that seems to have evolved, perhaps in consequence to the contest for possession that the breakdown has become after years of first the attacking side and then the defending one being given the greater rights in the area. There is one element of the breakdown that is being scrutinised with the view to a trial law change next season. There is concern that the end of matches are being blighted by teams holding on to the ball inordinately at a ruck with the scrum-half taking an age to pick up the ball and shovel it into the hands of the forward nearest to him. The proposed change is that a team will have five seconds to get the ball away. If they exceed the time limit, a referee will award a scrum to the opposition, a return of the old use-it-or-lose-it rule that briefly applied to rucks before being restricted to mauls. The five seconds could stretch to six or seven given the canniness of scrum-halves. So instead of a referee saying after five seconds \"use it or lose it\" why not merely utter \"ball out\", giving the opposition the right to go for it? It would deny a scrum-half that extra second or two and would mean having to decide what to do before the five seconds were up. Yet there would still be something artificial about it. The concern is a consequence of the countdown clock in the game that allows spectators at the ground and watching on television to know exactly when time will be up. When the referee was the keeper of time and decided how long there would be for stoppages, he would be able to add on seconds if he felt a team was time-wasting and could tell them so. Why not return to stoppage time, like football, where crowds are told the minimum, not exact, number of minutes that will be added on, and add an element of suspense to the end of games rather than fiddle as teams work out ways of running down the ticking clock? World Cup watch The International Rugby Board will discuss potential law changes at its council meeting in May. The policy is that any which are implemented have to be in force two years before the World Cup, which gives it until next year. The scrum is being looked at. While the crouch, touch, pause, engage ritual seems to satisfy no one, collapses and resets only seem to be an issue at the elite end of the game. Every rule change is scrutinised in these days of analysis and teams work out ways of neutralising it. Making defenders stand five metres behind at a scrum was meant to make the set piece a real means of attack, but how many attacking scrums in an opponent's 22 are completed in a Test match? The IRB will also decide in May when the 2015 World Cup will start, how the money for the tier one nations should be divided up and whether Wales will be allowed to play any of their matches at the Millennium Stadium. Wales's hopes would appear to be enhanced by the appointment of the chairman of the Welsh Rugby Union, David Pickering, on to the board of Rugby World Cup Ltd, one of two new faces along with the chief executive of the Australian Rugby Union, John O'Neill. They replaced Syd Millar, the former IRB chairman, and Bill Beaumont, neither of whom, sources suggest, went quietly. If there was not quite the ruckus kicked up in Auckland last October and in Los Angeles a couple of months later, it was apparently not as harmonious as the official line suggested. Pickering and O'Neill were on opposite sides in last year's election of the IRB chairman. Pickering was the chief barker for Beaumont, subsequently losing his position on the IRB's executive committee, while O'Neill was Bernard Lapasset's facilitator. Their election together seems to be an attempt to end the hemisphere divide that seems to have blighted the IRB for so long. The advertisement for the position of chief executive to replace Mike Miller will be in Sunday's newspapers and an appointment is scheduled to be made by the start of the summer. The issue of the Millennium Stadium will be an early test for Pickering, it was said last week. He will be expected to bat not for Wales but to consider whether it would be fair, in a one-nation tournament, for a team below tier one level, with pretensions to make the quarter-finals, to concede home advantage. And it should not be forgotten, given where they are in the world rankings, that Scotland could find themselves in a group with Wales and the likes of Samoa or Fiji. The argument for Wales playing in Cardiff is financial, but what is the price of compromising the integrity of the tournament?",

      "body": "<p>When England defeated Australia in the autumn of November 2010, playing with pace and an element of risk, Ben Youngs was the catalyst. The Leicester scrum-half looked for space and helped his side play with a flow that suggested, for the first time under Martin Johnson, they would be among the contenders for the World Cup.</p> <p>In the opening two games of the 2011 Six Nations, his club half-back partner, Toby Flood, was influential, breaking the defence in a tight opener against Wales and then running from everywhere against Italy, kicking only once out of hand during the rout at Twickenham.</p> <p>Flood will not be at the Stade de France on Sunday. Injury forced him to miss the start of the Six Nations, but when his replacement, Charlie Hodgson, was himself ruled out after scoring England's two tries in their opening games, Owen Farrell was given the No10 jersey against Wales at Twickenham with Flood only making the bench.</p> <p>Now Hodgson is fit, Flood has returned to Leicester. Youngs will be among the replacements in Paris after losing his place against Wales to Lee Dickson, who fully justified his selection while Youngs struggled to make an impact after coming on with 20 minutes to go.</p> <p>The Leicester head coach Matt O'Connor this week rounded on the England interim head coach Stuart Lancaster, accusing him of not wanting creative players and coaching his players not to lose.</p> <p>\"There is nothing I have seen so far in the Six Nations that indicates England want to go out and beat teams,\" he said. \"Under the current structure, I cannot see that changing. If you are talking about building a side for the World Cup in 2015, you have to go out and play.\"</p> <p>A coach defending his players is hardly surprising, and there is an implicit criticism of the club that defeated Leicester in last season's Premiership final, Saracens, in O'Connor's words \u2013 given the influence the champions have in England's back division with Owen Farrell, Brad Barritt, David Strettle and, from the summer, Chris Ashton.</p> <p>But England declined in terms of creativity after the victory over Italy last year and the end of that Six Nations, when England collapsed against Ireland in Dublin, marked Youngs's then low point in a white jersey. It was also an evening during which Flood struggled and the World Cup repaired the reputation of neither player.</p> <p>In that context, they were on the ebb before Lancaster took over. Lancaster picked Youngs in Scotland and Italy, which he may not have done had Danny Care been available, but the scrum-half looked a shell of the player who had so tormented the Wallabies, someone who perhaps needs his club environment to recapture his form because his international career still has some way to run. He has lost his form, not his talent.</p> <p>Opponents had become alert to him, even if England's habit of using slow forwards off nine, a feature of the World Cup, did little to take advantage of Youngs's attacking instincts.

      "bodyText": "I picked up When I Was a Child\u2026 with a curiosity about Marilynne Robinson equal only to her disinclination to give anything away \u2013 in a homespun, ordinary, autobiographical sense \u2013 about herself. This book is not, as its title might suggest, a memoir. Nor is it about childhood. She says there is a difference \u2013 for a writer as well as for readers \u2013 between \"knowing\" a person and \"knowing about\" them, and the extraordinary experience of reading these idiosyncratic, high-minded theological essays is about the former. It is the equivalent of an uncommon library ticket, an admission to the subjects that most obsess her: the frail human enterprise, faith and its absence, mysteries that elude language. All Robinson's writing has a devotional quality. On the face of it, her novels \u2013 especially Gilead and its sequel Home \u2013 were unlikely successes because of their Christian hearts. Why would an unhurried book about a pastor named Reverend Ames disarm secular audiences (and win the Pulitzer prize)? Perhaps because, aside from the consummate delicacy with which these novels were written, they supplied a lack, were concerned with the sacred in a way much contemporary fiction is not. Her novels have a unique atmosphere, a sad, steady sense of human faultiness, but there is, at the same time, always the possibility of grace. She says in this new book that she detects in many people now a \"wistfulness and regret for the loss of Christianity.\" Robinson teaches creative writing in Iowa City. She was raised a Presbyterian, became a Congregationalist and is a great defender of Calvinism (as in her previous essay collection The Death of Adam). In all her writing, her unrushed relationship with time \u2013 and to the past \u2013 is crucial (and I don't mean the 24-year gap between her first and second novels). This book is scholarly closework, as painstaking as a Victorian sampler but more subtle. She is determined never to undervalue or oversimplify. There is a sense that to be meditative is a necessary part of being alive. She is especially clear on the absurdity of seeing religion and science as adversarial. She urges fearful believers to \"subscribe to Scientific American for a year\" to extend their wonder at God's grandeur. And she tells us, in passing, about a scientific experiment of her own. She was educated at a centre of behaviourist psychology where they \"pestered\" rats (in a maze-learning experiment) and attempted to \"lure\" them with Cheerios \u2013 her rat turned out not to be easy to bribe. It seems appropriate that her rat was a rebel for there is nothing Robinson likes less than facile conclusions about motivation. She deplores \"so-called rational choice economics which assumes we will all find the shortest way to the reward\". She has no truck with the selfish gene \u2013 if anything, she seems to think a selfless gene more likely. She asks why society is full of arrangements that \"seem to inhibit or defeat self-interest?\" Yet, at the same time, she is anti \"austerity\" as a policy (and is especially eloquent about its deleterious effects on American universities). Resistance to explanation informs her writing too. Her characters evolve through intuition: \"A character is really the sense of a character, embodied, attired and given voice as he or she seems to require.\" She does not say much about the literature that has fed her imagination. Her childhood library does not appear to include any stalwarts \u2013 no mention of Lewis Carroll, CS Lewis, Anna Sewell. What she says instead is: \"I preferred books that were old and thick and hard. I made vocabulary lists.\" As a child, she knew about \"Constantinople, the Cromwell revolution and chivalry\". She was a mini-scholar, and an imaginative one with a light self-mockery to leaven her earnestness. There is a beautiful sentence in a chapter describing her books, read and unread, where she imagines Homer coming to call: \"It pleases me to think how astonished old Homer, whosoever he was, would be to find his epics on the shelf of such an unimaginable being as myself, in the middle of an unrumoured continent.\" Reading turned her into a writer. And it stirs her to protest and defend.

      "body": "<p>I picked up <em>When I Was a Child\u2026</em> with a curiosity about Marilynne Robinson equal only to her disinclination to give anything away \u2013 in a homespun, ordinary, autobiographical sense \u2013 about herself. This book is not, as its title might suggest, a memoir. Nor is it about childhood. She says there is a difference \u2013 for a writer as well as for readers \u2013 between \"knowing\" a person and \"knowing about\" them, and the extraordinary experience of reading these idiosyncratic, high-minded theological essays is about the former. It is the equivalent of an uncommon library ticket, an admission to the subjects that most obsess her: the frail human enterprise, faith and its absence, mysteries that elude language.</p> <p>All Robinson's writing has a devotional quality. On the face of it, her novels \u2013 especially <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/16/fiction.alismith\" title=\"\"><em>Gilead</em></a> and its sequel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/04/fiction\" title=\"\"><em>Home</em></a> \u2013 were unlikely successes because of their Christian hearts. Why would an unhurried book about a pastor named Reverend Ames disarm secular audiences (and win the Pulitzer prize)? Perhaps because, aside from the consummate delicacy with which these novels were written, they supplied a lack, were concerned with the sacred in a way much contemporary fiction is not.</p> <p>Her novels have a unique atmosphere, a sad, steady sense of human faultiness, but there is, at the same time, always the possibility of grace. She says in this new book that she detects in many people now a \"wistfulness and regret for the loss of Christianity.\"</p> <p>Robinson teaches creative writing in Iowa City. She was raised a Presbyterian, became a Congregationalist and is a great defender of Calvinism (as in her previous essay collection <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Death_of_Adam.html?id=xegyS0lLhbgC\" title=\"\"><em>The Death of Adam</em></a>). In all her writing, her unrushed relationship with time \u2013 and to the past \u2013 is crucial (and I don't mean the 24-year gap between her first and second novels). This book is scholarly closework, as painstaking as a Victorian sampler but more subtle. She is determined never to undervalue or oversimplify. There is a sense that to be meditative is a necessary part of being alive. She is especially clear on the absurdity of seeing religion and science as adversarial. She urges fearful believers to \"subscribe to <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Scientific American</em></a> for a year\" to extend their wonder at God's grandeur.</p> <p>And she tells us, in passing, about a scientific experiment of her own. She was educated at a centre of behaviourist psychology where they \"pestered\" rats (in a maze-learning experiment) and attempted to \"lure\" them with Cheerios \u2013 her rat turned out not to be easy to bribe. It seems appropriate that her rat was a rebel for there is nothing Robinson likes less than facile conclusions about motivation. She deplores \"so-called rational choice economics which assumes we will all find the shortest way to the reward\". She has no truck with the selfish gene \u2013 if anything, she seems to think a selfless gene more likely. She asks why society is full of arrangements that \"seem to inhibit or defeat self-interest?\" Yet, at the same time, she is anti \"austerity\" as a policy (and is especially eloquent about its deleterious effects on American universities).</p> <p>Resistance to explanation informs her writing too. Her characters evolve through intuition: \"A character is really the sense of a character, embodied, attired and given voice as he or she seems to require.\"</p> <p>She does not say much about the literature that has fed her imagination. Her childhood library does not appear to include any stalwarts \u2013 no mention of Lewis Carroll, CS Lewis, Anna Sewell. What she says instead is: \"I preferred books that were old and thick and hard. I made vocabulary lists.\" As a child, she knew about \"Constantinople, the Cromwell revolution and chivalry\". She was a mini-scholar, and an imaginative one with a light self-mockery to leaven her earnestness. There is a beautiful sentence in a chapter describing her books, read and unread, where she imagines Homer coming to call: \"It pleases me to think how astonished old Homer, whosoever he was, would be to find his epics on the shelf of such an unimaginable being as myself, in the middle of an unrumoured continent.\"</p> <p>Reading turned her into a writer. And it stirs her to protest and defend. She champions the Old Testament, Moses and his laws, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._F._Oberlin\" title=\"\">Johann Friedrich Oberlin</a>, Iowa, American hymns and 18th-century theologians <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Grandison_Finney\" title=\"\">Charles Finney</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)\" title=\"\">Jonathan Edwards</a>. Her adversaries meet a gentle nemesis: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shelby_Spong\" title=\"\">Bishop Spong</a>, Jack Miles (author of<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/God-Biography-Vintage-Jack-Miles/dp/0679743685\" title=\"\"><em>God: a Biography</em></a>), evolutionary psychologist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/18/satoshi-kanazawa-black-women-psychology-today\" title=\"\">Satoshi Kanazawa</a>.

      "bodyText": "Salford's community conversation seemed set for a wobbly start when it heard that the Reading the Riots investigation had data from just seven people involved in the city's troubles last August. The panel, which included council leader John Merry and Greater Manchester Police's divisional head Chief Supt Kevin Mulligan, was naturally sceptical about drawing too many conclusions from such a small sample. But their caution was good-natured and polite and, as in Manchester, the chairing style of Coun Amina Lone built on the very large audience's enthusiasm for a practical debate which would further the process of sorting out problems, causes and grievances. The data size also became marginal once it was clear that it reflected issues raised from much wider sampling over a long time, notably by panel members Graham Cooper from the Broughton Trust and Gerry Stone from the Seedley and Langworthy Trust. Their findings also chimed with neighbouring Manchester's; indeed some of the RtR research was common to both; an interviewee's description of the police as 'the biggest gang of all' was presented to Manchester's conversation on Tuesday, as well as last night's. Relations with the police figured largely; Cooper said that previous good relations between local officers and young people had 'deteriorated', then corrected himself and said 'disappeared'. A pensioner in the 200-plus audience gave an example of alleged heavy-handedness: a cousin borrowed his disabled pass and police came round and told him that if it happened again, they would be 'through his door' \u2013 with the implication that it might get battered down. Alienation from a corrupt elite \u2013 better called a 'feral elite' suggested another audience member - was widely cited. It wasn't always coherent or thought-out, said Stone, but it was definitely a gut feeling, prompted by headlines about MPs' expenses, bankers' bonuses and the like. Ditto the sense of buzz; told by one young troublemaker that it was 'the best day of my life', Cooper described the common task as 'making all his other days as good' in constructive ways. The third main issue raised at Manchester, of a lack of a platform for young people's views, was part of the Salford mixture as well. It brought in a particular local complaint, which united everyone from Merry to the Socialist Worker sellers: that the national media, which could provide such a platform (and through Reading the Riots is trying to), persisted in demonising sections of society - hoodies, those on benefits et al - and also presenting them in the clich\u00e9d context of grim-up-north. There was an admission, too, of a local tradition of talking Salford down. Little acknowledgment was made of the arrival of the BBC, which figured at the meeting only in terms of jobs provision rather than the chance of a lifetime for anyone seeking a platform, or a better and more accurate picture of Salford and the wider north. A BBC crew from MediaCityUK was at the meeting. Merry and Mulligan gave data about post-troubles convictions which, as in Manchester, involved a large majority of white people, aged over 18 and with criminal records. Both blamed an element of organised crime for taking advantage of the trouble and making it worse \u2013 a charge not levelled in Manchester \u2013 and suggested that improved detection rates and a steady fall in crime in the last four years in Salford may have fuelled professional criminals' desire to hit back. These different and opposing emphases \u2013 on poor police relations, or criminal involvement \u2013 were accepted by the meeting as part of a complex pattern, rather than causes for division. Conservative councillor Robin Garrido, whose wife Karen is Tory candidate for Salford's elected mayor, got a ripple of applause when he called for attention to be paid not just to young people but to their parents, and to the consequences of unemployment stretching to a second generation in households, or even a third. The head of Salford College was also there, and a lawyer who had acted for people accused of involvement in August, who said that court procedures had been stiffened beyond any previous experience he had had, almost certainly on instructions from higher up. At the end, the Guardian's Symeon Brown underlined the particular value of community conversations in an area where initial research had been limited. Dozens of people responded to his request to add their views on feedback forms; and the research exercise will now continue apace under the aegis of the local Social Action and Research Foundation, led by Amina Lone and Northerner contributor Dan Silver.",

      "bodyText": "Women's rights have come a long way since the first International Women's Day in 1900. Early campaigners would be proud of the transformative role they played in securing votes for women, opening up access to male-only professions, and criminalising domestic violence and rape in the UK. The world is unquestionably better for many women than it was 100 years ago, thanks in no small part to the early pioneers. But we cannot be complacent. There is still a long way to go. There is not yet worldwide recognition that women's rights are human rights. This year we have witnessed again how women are subjected to violence and oppression, and denied the most basic of rights around the world. The horrific events unfolding in Syria remind us that we must stand in solidarity with women caught up in the horror of the conflict. Not only are brave women like Marie Colvin losing their lives to shine a light on the unfolding conflict, but Syrian women are at the frontline of a conflict that is tearing the country apart. And out of the headlines, rape and sexual violence continue to scar women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 one in 10 of whom have been raped, many more than once. Around the world, women are paying the price of war; they work tirelessly for peace, yet they are often not invited to the negotiating table during the peace process. In the Middle East women's rights are still neglected, despite momentous changes that have taken place through the Arab spring. We mustn't forget that in Saudi Arabia women are not permitted to drive, and if they are unmarried they must remain under male guardianship, effectively diminishing their status to that of a child. Even in post-revolution Egypt there are only nine women MPs \u2013 less than 1%, down from 12% under President Mubarak. In fact, less than 20% of the world's parliamentarians are women. Less than 10% of countries have a female head of state, and less than 3% of signatories to peace agreements are women. Every minute, a woman dies in pregnancy or childbirth and another 20-30 women suffer serious injury or disability. Women face a barrage of difficulties, just because of their sex. Education can play a pivotal role in empowering women to fight this glaring injustice. Study after study has shown that educating girls is one of the most effective ways to fight poverty and social prejudice. Yet girls' education is still not valued as highly as boys', despite evidence of the huge benefits it brings to individuals and to communities. Indeed, women's education has what the head of the UN Development Programme calls a \"multiplier effect\". Educating women improves their rights in all areas, including property and work. Financial independence, born out of better education, brings prosperity to local communities. Education improves health \u2013 girls with post-primary education are five times more likely to be knowledgeable about HIV and Aids. Figures consistently show that mothers who have been educated are more likely to give birth in health facilities. Despite all these benefits, 30 million more girls than boys are out of school. The UK government uses aid to promote low-fee providers, but evidence shows that very low income families often have to choose whose fees to pay, and boys regularly squeeze girls out. Removing school fees altogether and providing financial incentives for girls to attend schools is what works \u2013 as Brazil has shown through its Bolsa Familia scheme \u2013 and that should be prioritised instead. And while the Department for International Development's focus on getting girls into school is commendable, its Girls Education Challenge Fund must complement and support the domestic government's own plans, not operate as a separate and parallel fund. DfID should always seek to help developing countries build their own universal school systems. Education is a basic human right, and denying it to women and girls is unacceptable. Empowering women and achieving gender equality is a difficult and slow process that entails shifting attitudes, traditions and practices. We must commit to a long-term plan. The first 100 years of International Women's Day brought us so much, but as the UK government's spending cuts impact so negatively on women that leading equality charities have declared them illegal, we know how far we still have to go. \u2022 Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead is honorary co-president of the Labour Campaign for International Development. \u2022 Jo Cox is chair of Labour Women's Network",

This year we have witnessed again how women are subjected to violence and oppression, and denied the most basic of rights around the world.</p> <p>The horrific events unfolding in Syria remind us that we must stand in solidarity with women caught up in the horror of the conflict. Not only are brave women like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/feb/22/marie-colvin\" title=\"\">Marie Colvin</a> losing their lives to shine a light on the unfolding conflict, but Syrian women are at the frontline of a conflict that is tearing the country apart.</p> <p>And out of the headlines, rape and sexual violence continue to scar women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 one in 10 of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/14/worst-places-in-the-world-for-women-congo\" title=\"\">whom have been raped</a>, many more than once. Around the world, women are paying the price of war; they work tirelessly for peace, yet they are often not invited to the negotiating table during the peace process.</p> <p>In the Middle East women's rights are still neglected, despite momentous changes that have taken place through the Arab spring. We mustn't forget that in Saudi Arabia women are not permitted to drive, and if they are unmarried they must remain under male guardianship, effectively diminishing their status to that of a child. Even in post-revolution Egypt there are only nine women MPs \u2013 less than 1%, down from 12% under President Mubarak.</p> <p>In fact, less than 20% of the world's parliamentarians are women. Less than 10% of countries have a female head of state, and less than 3% of signatories to peace agreements are women. Every minute, a woman dies in pregnancy or childbirth and another 20-30 women suffer serious injury or disability. Women face a barrage of difficulties, just because of their sex.</p> <p>Education can play a pivotal role in empowering women to fight this glaring injustice. Study after study has shown that educating girls is one of the most effective ways to fight poverty and social prejudice. Yet girls' education is still not valued as highly as boys', despite evidence of the huge benefits it brings to individuals and to communities.</p> <p>Indeed, women's education has what the head of the UN Development Programme calls a \"multiplier effect\". Educating women improves their rights in all areas, including property and work. Financial independence, born out of better education, brings prosperity to local communities. Education improves health \u2013 girls with post-primary education are five times more likely to be knowledgeable about HIV and Aids. Figures consistently show that mothers who have been educated are more likely to give birth in health facilities.</p> <p>Despite all these benefits, 30 million more girls than boys are out of school. The UK government uses aid to promote low-fee providers, but evidence shows that very low income families often have to choose whose fees to pay, and boys regularly squeeze girls out. Removing school fees altogether and providing financial incentives for girls to attend schools is what works \u2013 as Brazil has shown through its Bolsa Familia scheme \u2013 and that should be prioritised instead.</p> <p>And while the Department for International Development's focus on getting girls into school is commendable, its <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/News/Press-releases/2011/Educating-one-million-girls-to-tackle-poverty/\" title=\"\">Girls Education Challenge Fund</a> must complement and support the domestic government's own plans, not operate as a separate and parallel fund. DfID should always seek to help developing countries build their own universal school systems.</p> <p>Education is a basic human right, and denying it to women and girls is unacceptable. Empowering women and achieving gender equality is a difficult and slow process that entails shifting attitudes, traditions and practices. We must commit to a long-term plan.</p> <p>The first 100 years of International Women's Day brought us so much, but as the UK government's spending cuts impact so negatively on women that <a href=\"http://fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1165\" title=\"\">leading equality charities have declared them illegal</a>, we know how far we still have to go.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead is honorary co-president of the </em><a href=\"http://www.lcid.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Labour Campaign for International Development</em></a><em>. </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Jo Cox is chair of </em><a href=\"http://www.labourwomensnetwork.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Labour Women's Network</em></a></p>",

Google Play: The new name for Android Market &gt;&gt; Pocket-lint We didn't cover this as we were busy with LulzSec/Anonymous the other day: From Monday, you'll no longer download apps from the Android Market, but instead, from Google Play. Over the next few days the firm will push out an update to Android handsets that changes the name of the app you were using. This might confuse some, especially as Market updates tend to happen more automatically than most. Nothing much changes though. The name is to reflect the new multimedia store that sells not only apps, but music, videos and ebooks too. This was something that Android Market did before, with sections for apps, movies and books growing out of the original offering which was solely for apps. Google is also hoping that this new name, and some minor tweaks, will make people spend more money. That might be true, but we can't see anyone being prepared to cough up \u00a34.49 to rent \"The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption\". Eben Upton of Raspberry Pi interviewed &gt;&gt; Nottingham Science Blog Eben Upton, one of the trustees of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, kindly agreed to an interview with NSB recently. It was a fascinating discussion, touching on how the number of people studying Computer Science has dropped over the last 10-15years, tips for youngsters who want to enter this field, and what it has been like to develop the Raspberry Pi device. A transcript of the best bits is shown below. Enjoy. This has been one of the most eagerly-awaited pieces of British technology we can ever remember. And we have long memories. We Need to Talk About Android &gt;&gt; Fraser Speirs I spoke at a conference near Cardiff recently and in Q&amp;A, I got The Question. I love getting the question. What's the question? This: \"What's wrong with Android?\" I realised, giving my answer, that I've never written down my objections to Android. Before we get into this, let's understand that I'm primarily talking about \"what's wrong with Android from the perspective of someone planning a long-term 1:1 deployment in a school\". Though one would have thought that you could replace \"school\" with \"enterprise\". Though perhaps enterprises have more money for customising things such as backup. Note one of his conclusions: \"You're either buying into a platform or you're buying gadgets.\" Inside the mind of a hacker &gt;&gt; Fox News Fox had the scoop on Sabu. This however reads a bit like A Doctor Writes in Private Eye: There has been no indication thus far that Monsegur is a methodical criminal who has amassed a great fortune. Nor has anyone suggested that he is a cyber-terrorist attacking entities that oppose his political or religious ideology (though time will tell). Instead, the data at hand would suggest that chaos, in and of itself, is the reward he seeks--busting things up, bringing them down, causing people to suffer as the structure they rely upon to organize their thoughts and intentions dissolves. Note that it also hits Godwin's Law a few paragraphs later. Was Anonymous' hacker-informant Sabu a tool of FBI entrapment? &gt;&gt; Forbes Obvious question: criminal defense lawyers for those accused hackers are no doubt poring over [Sabu's] communications with their clients, and looking for evidence of entrapment: the defense that the U.S. government, with an influential member of Anonymous as their pawn, pushed hackers into the same illegal acts for which they're now prosecuting them. Months after Monsegur [Sabu's real name] began cooperating with law enforcement, his Twitter feed (with 45,000 followers) continued to rally his hacktivist \"brothers\" to attack governments and private corporate targets. A message he wrote in late December asked for fellow hackers to give him stolen documents so that they could be published under the banner of \"Antisec,\" the sub-movement against the security industry in which he was a vocal organizer. \"Leakers, security researchers or hackers who have vulnerabilities or leaked docs contact us,\" Monsegur wrote. One would hope the FBI had that figured out already, given it was monitoring his communication 24/7. Google looking to unload Motorola's TV set-top box business &gt;&gt; NYPOST.com It's the New York Post, a tabloid, but then Fox News had the Sabu scoop earlier this week: This just in: The TV set-top box is on its deathbed. Google is looking to unload the set-top box business it will inherit from Motorola Mobility even before it closes on the $12.5 billion acquisition, The Post has learned. The move appears to be an about-face from last August, when Google CEO Larry Page, in announcing the deal, suggested the business would play a role in his plans for revolutionizing the living room. Google isn't the only player looking to get out of the business. As The Post reported exclusively last month, Cisco is also seeking to sell Scientific Atlanta, which along with Motorola has had a near duopoly on the set-top box business. Point being that the set-top box business is the only profitable part of MMI. Microsoft and Apple should hit Amazon, not Google &gt;&gt; The Register Matt Asay: Amazon's fork of Google's Android is a far bigger threat to Apple's iOS than Samsung or other Android licensees ever were, because it comes backed by an entire ecosystem of Amazon-supplied content. This hurts Apple, but it also minimises Google's benefits from Android, as well, as Amazon's Kindle Fire comes with an Amazon browser, not Google's. And Amazon, not Google (or Apple) cleans up on content purchased through the device. Apple Special Event March 2012 &gt;&gt; Apple Wednesday's introduction of \"The New iPad\", and associated things.

      "bodyText": "No one disputes that women have a long way to go in achieving equal status in broadcasting and film. But it is also easy to fall into the trap of whinging about unfairness, rather than saluting those who win through. That is the point of the Top 50 Powerlist, relaunched on Thursday by Women in Film &amp; TV, in association with Screen International and Broadcast. After a first stab in 2010, it is timed to mark and chime with International Women's Day. Tonally, it is striving to change the pitch from minor to major: people of achievement clearly come in both sexes. Kate Kinninmont, WFTV chief executive, says that in \"true womanly style\" the list is not arranged in any order, though one ambitious TV executive is understood to have inquired about her position. The power list is eclectic but constructed to cover the off-screen executives who run organisations, and the on-screen talent. So in the case of the BBC there are five executives: Caroline Thomson, chief executive officer and candidate to be director general: Helen Boaden, head of BBC News, also in the running to be DG: Janice Hadlow, BBC2 controller; Jana Bennett, president BBC Worldwide networks and global iPlayer; and Christine Langan, creative director of BBC Films. There is a salute to the tiny handful of top women screenwriters. But the list is also, in the best WFTV tradition, studded with achievers easy to overlook. For example, Denise O'Donoghue, managing director of ITV Studios, pushing up its home made production base; Vanessa Berlowitz, series producer of Frozen Planet; Lisbeth Savill of Olswang, who sits on a range of industry boards including the BFI; and Moira Ross, Wall to Wall's head of entertainment, working on The Voice. Newcomers include the Sky News correspondent, Alex Crawford, whose calculated bravery during the Arab spring uprising landed her the scoop of the fall of Tripoli. Another key entrant is screenwriter Jane Goldman, for The Woman in Black. She appears alongside Heidi Thomas (Call the Midwife, Upstairs Downstairs), Abi Morgan, (Shame, The Iron Lady, Birdsong, The Hour), and Moira Buffini (Tamara Drewe, Jane Eyre). Women who have built output are singled out, notably Jane Root, founder and chairman of Nutopia, the Anglo-American TV producer behind America: The Story of US, and Lucy Lumsden, the respected head of comedy at Sky for the past two and a half years, who has played a key role in increasing the broadcaster's UK-originated scripted output. On-screen talent includes Keira Knightley, Cambridge-educated actor Naomi Harris, the next Bond Girl, and Kirsty Wark. The overall tally is 21 executives, 14 producer/directors, 11 on-screen talent, and four writers. Which invites the question, who has been left out? And the observation that there is a lack of women of colour in several categories. A powerlist can only reflect back to us the world as it is. Imperfect. But self-aware.",

      "bodyText": "The debate around how to address gender inequality at board level is gaining momentum. Regulators, politicians and shareholders are each stepping up pressure on companies for greater board diversity as part of a drive for better governance. Early this week, European justice commissioner Viviane Reding launched a public consultation to generate proposals \u2013 including possible legislation \u2013 to increase women's participation at senior levels in companies. It's just over a year since Lord Davies published a UK government-backed report that set a target for a minimum of 25% female board representation in FTSE-100 companies by 2015, but stopped short of compulsory measures. Since the launch of the Davies report, progress on improving the gender balance on UK boards has been slow. According to the 30% club \u2013 a group of chairmen voluntarily committed to bringing more women onto UK boards \u2013 only 15% of FTSE 100 board directorships are now held by women. While the ratio of female appointments has doubled over the last few years, it is still only 27%. Looking beyond the FTSE 100, there is little evidence of significant progress in closing the gender gap. EIRIS data shows that 46% of UK companies listed on the FTSE All Share Index have no women on the board, whereas 15% of north American companies in the FTSE All World Developed Index have no women on the board, and in the Asia Pacific region the figure is 73%. Gender representation forms part of a wider focus on board effectiveness and diversity, which encompasses other features including age, ethnicity, background, education and experience. Increased diversity (including gender balance) not only better represents the staff in a company but also its clients, customer base, supply chain and potentially the different regions across which it operates. Carrot or stick? While a growing number of companies and investors acknowledge that greater board diversity is a good thing, opinions differ as to how best to achieve this. Some argue for quotas to force UK companies to put a minimum number of women on boards. They point to the rise in female representation at board level in countries such as Norway and France, which has occurred subsequent to quotas being introduced in these countries. However, others argue that quotas undermine the principle of equality, are patronising to women and can result in situations whereby women are appointed as mere figures-heads who take on multiple boardrooms to fill quotas. Instead, they argue for a more business-led approach whereby directors are appointed on merit and business leaders take affirmative action in moving voluntarily towards a better gender diversity. As the debate continues, attention is focused on whether or not women on boards may create value for shareholders, or put another way, to what extent is gender diversity a financially significant issue? A forthcoming study conducted by academics from the Centre for Responsible Banking &amp; Finance of the University of St Andrews and the Principles for Responsible Investment Academic Network sets out to explore this. Focusing on more than 1,500 companies from 26 developed countries, over a 90-month period, the study combines data from EIRIS that categorises companies according to the percentage of women on their board with financial performance data. At the global level, larger companies are found to have more women on their boards, probably due to their high visibility and consequently outside pressure for greater diversity. Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Spain and Switzerland do not have any companies that have more than 33% women on their boards. Additionally, no Greek, Irish or Portuguese company has more than 20% women on its board of directors. On the other hand, the Scandinavian countries of Finland, Norway and Sweden do not have any listed company belonging to the lower category (ie no female representation at board level). Globally, a value-weighted portfolio of those companies with more than 33% women on boards of directors is found to generate significant positive excess financial returns. In the US, those companies with more than 33% of women on the board are found to outperform market and investment style benchmarks. In Greece and Italy, the situation looks less promising for businesswomen, as those companies with no women on the board perform well. While there are other factors that may account for positive and negative returns, the study's findings tend to support initiatives that bring women on corporate boards in developed countries. However, it is important to note that female directors are also likely to add value in many qualitative ways, which may not be discernible directly in the short term. It's clear that a greater impetus is needed if real progress is to be made in tackling gender inequality. Investors are ideally placed to challenge the composition and diversity of boards. Through direct engagement, shareholders can put pressure on companies to take affirmative action in moving towards a better gender balance at all levels in their organisations.

      "bodyText": "It's only March. Alright, the first snowdrops have been and gone, but are we really ready for another round of festival season? Apparently so. As Brian Logan wrote yesterday, it kicks off this month with Sprint and Fierce, then escalates with the summer's big-hitters like Lift, World Stage and the World Shakespeare festival. To think that, only last year, Michael Eavis declared the festival a dying breed. So how does the festival evolve? Two provocations from Lift's symposium on that topic have surfaced online. Forest Fringe's co-director Andy Field warns against making a paradigm of Forest Fringe, urging others to start their own according to their own specific circumstances. \"Forest Fringe is not so much an example, as it is perhaps an encouraging wave from the other side of the river.\" While Field wonders what a temporary, one-off festival might be, Forced Entertainment's Tim Etchells finishes his \"Alphabet of Festivals\" by positing \"a festival without end\". Descriptive and prescriptive, despondent and hopeful, it's a gorgeous read. Etchells writes: \"There is an idea of what is possible and, in one sense, the purpose of a festival is to change that idea.\" Art, of course, has the same aim, though \u2013 as several bloggers have argued this week \u2013 it's not always that simple. At HowlRound, US playwright Karen Malpede talks in terms of content. \"All plays are about something,\" she writes. \"The question is whether or not that something matters very much.\" She lists a vast array of topics unlikely to be seen onstage in the States, from the invasion of Iraq on false pretences to critiques of American exceptionalism, and points towards \"financial censorship\", where such topics are deemed too unwieldy, too awkward or \"too risky\" to back. George Hunka, meanwhile, has flagged German critic Robin Detje's essay against post-dramatic theatre as form, which argues that bringing reality onstage has entailed a retreat from the sort of reality that matters, which \"has bigger guns than theatre\". Full of devices that \"prove that we are in the now\", post-dramatic theatre is entangled in theory: \"On [the artist's] hard drive, there is the musty smell of a thousand seminars.\" Yet Detje argues that we gets the theatre we deserve and ours, he suggests, remains an apathetic age, with \"everyone in isolation, too scared to let artists show us that we might be able to change the world or even contribute to its state \u2013 each of us immobilised, unable to act\". Perhaps the process happens one mind at a time. That's playwright Nimer Rashed's argument, sparked by Charles Spencer's Telegraph review of Snookered, which opens thus: \"When one thinks of young male Muslims in Britain today, I suspect the first image that comes to mind is of indoctrinated fanatics \u2026\" He later qualifies that statement, but Rashed \u2013 rightly \u2013 takes issue with it nonetheless. \"'When one thinks' is a pernicious phrase \u2013 it encourages prejudice without accountability \u2026 'One' claims to speak for the many, but instead speaks for no one in particular. It is groupspeak, and it is extremely dangerous.\" Rashed argues that theatre exists to jettison such dead cliches: \"This is what theatre can do, if we allow it. It's why writers write, why audiences make their pilgrimage. To learn. To empathise. To grow. Otherwise we're left with Mr Spencer's 'mental pictures' that are 'difficult to erase': the indoctrination of cliche. And when one thinks of all the possibilities, really: who would opt for that?\"",

The final decision on his participation at the Festival will not be made until Monday, however, to allow Smith and Paul Nicholls, Kauto Star's trainer, to assess his response to a racecourse gallop at Wincanton on Friday afternoon.

Optimism that the Festival's headline performer would take his place in the Gold Cup, probably for the last time, has increased in recent days, but the news, good or bad, will still be delayed until 24 hours before the meeting's opening day on Tuesday. \"He's coming along nicely now and is almost back to normal,\" Smith said. \"We're nearly there, I think. \"The decision on whether he runs or not will be made on Monday, not Friday. Paul has said that he will school him on the grass gallops at home, as he has done every year before Cheltenham, and after he's done that, the decision will be announced.\" Smith will be at Wincanton on Friday to watch Kauto Star exercise after racing with Mon Parrain, one of his stablemates. The gallop is expected to take place at about 5.45pm. If he makes it to Cheltenham, Kauto Star is expected to start second-favourite for the Gold Cup at around 7-2, behind Long Run, who beat him into third in last year's renewal of steeplechasing's championship event. He drifted to 8-1 on the Betfair betting exchange when news of his schooling setback emerged, but he has since settled at 5-1, with \u00a32,000 available to be matched at that price on Thursday morning.",

      "bodyText": "Transport for London (TfL) figures show that road-traffic volumes in London have been in general decline for 10 years, but also that a hefty 35% of journey stages in the capital are still taken by car \u2013 more than the bus, tram and London Underground combined. Car use is greatest in outer London, where public transport alternatives often aren't ideal. The capital's road network has remained as important for freight transportation as it was 20 years ago. Plumbers, builders and carpet fitters can't ply their trade by bus. For all the alternative ways of getting around town, the motoring mode remains a popular choice, and for some the only option. At the same time TfL estimates that road traffic congestion costs the capital dear \u2013 about \u00a32bn a year, which dwarfs the sums the London Chamber of Commerce calculates are lost through tube strikes (\u00a348m for each strike day). There are health costs from motor vehicle use too. A report commissioned by Boris Johnson estimated that 4,300 people a year die prematurely due to pollution mostly disgorged from exhaust pipes. So how could and should the capital's road network be better managed? Even asking the question stirs a hornets' nest. It also crystalises some political paradoxes. On the face of it, road pricing should unite the political spectrum. London's first mayor, \"Red\" Ken Livingstone, who introduced congestion charging to the centre of the city in 2003, quipped that he got the idea from laissez faire evangelist Milton Friedman. His successor, Boris Johnson, has more than once acknowledged that the principle is true \"Chicago school\", and even though he abolished Livingstone's western extension of the charging zone \u2013 the WEZ \u2013 at the end of 2010, appeared to have privately concluded that retaining it in a modified form might have been better. Yet many London Tories still bitterly oppose congestion charging in any form, and Livingstone has spoken against reinstating the WEZ. As yet, only the Green party mayoral candidate, Jenny Jones, has advocated more road pricing. Her party's London-wide, pay-as-you-go proposition would use the newest technology and, it estimates, generate \u00a31bn-plus in revenue for TfL each year. The road freight industry thinks a form of fare to use London's roads would be a price worth paying in terms of reduced delays, but Londoners may be less sure. A consultation on the WEZ suggested divided opinion, and voters elsewhere in Britain have given congestion charging the thumbs down. Could the capital's electors be persuaded to want more of it? If so, how? Johnson has hailed other ways to \"smooth traffic flow\": rephasing traffic lights; remodelling the busy Henlys Corner junction; introducing a roadworks permit scheme . He's considering a lane rental system too. However, as BorisWatch has reported, TfL has found collisions to be the single biggest cause of road congestion. Perhaps stricter speed limits, encouraging more careful driving, further increasing the detection of uninsured drivers and more rigorous enforcement of road rules \u2013 as prioritised by London TravelWatch \u2013 would make a serious difference. Meanwhile, fierce debates rage about building more road bridges over, or tunnels under , the river Thames. Which scheme is best? Should more roads of all kinds be built underground? Would any extra road provision just make congestion worse in the end? At the heart of the matter lies the question of whether London or any other big city would thrive better now and in the future if it depended less on motor vehicles. Two points to end. One, there will be a separate piece devoted wholly to cycling and walking towards the end of next week. Two, thank you to everyone who's made thoughtful and constructive contributions to this project so far. I've begun drafting out sections of the manifesto, and they are full of your ideas. fkhjgwerkjbfhrkghe suggests: The most important thing is to keep the traffic moving. Traffic light sequencing should be far more sophisticated, and road works should be carried out as fast as possible. Keep the cars, busses, vans etc moving and you will cut pollution. Sort out the road signing too - it's all to easy to get lost - which is no good for anybody. Dave Hill replies: Morning. I'm sure you're right that traffic lights sequencing can be improved, and possibly has been recently. A fascinating seminar on the subject was held at City Hall a while ago, looking at the economic implications of traffic flow. Quite a complicated picture emerged. I agree about road signs too (especially in Bromley, where few seem to exist). But would even all the measures you suggest really solve the long-term congestion problem? RedRush suggests: Re-instate the Western Extension section of the Congestion Charging Zone Dave Hill replies: You might have to change your name to GreenRush, then! rtj1211 suggests: Is there any way you can model traffic flow at given volumes on the major arterial roads into London and, through that, try to sell 'permits' to travel in a, say, 30 minute slot to allow satisfactory flow through peak times. I think this would also require deep discussions with London's employers about whether there are significant numbers of people who can either start work earlier or later without affecting business unduly. The ultimate requirement of such an approach would be some kind of electronic recognition of your 'permit', a means to allow for a percentage to 'drift' into the next 10 minutes (people will be late, children will scream etc etc). If you priced it so that a 'double permit' (one recognising two people in one car) was 1.5 times a single person permit, you could incentivise people to share cars with other local people. Whether that's possible technologically, I don't know. It would be rife with cheats if not! The other major thought is that you would want to liaise with train operators about building some strategic park 'n' ride sites near the M25 allied to appropriate stations with the possibility for either high frequency trains or double deckers in future. it's longer term, but it's something that needs holistic thought as you'll probably be ripping up a bit of green belt land to build some major car parks. Dave Hill replies: Thank you. Really good thoughts. Options for a more sophisticated form of electronic monitoring of vehicles are explored in the report prepared by academics for the Green Party, which I refer to in my article. I know you're not proposing further road-pricing but you might find it interesting anyway. BeckyP suggests: \"At the end of 2010, appeared to have privately concluded that retaining it in a modified form might have been better.\" A more accurate interpretation was that Boris was more than likely having a harmless jest with someone who believed that Road Pricing was the best thing since the invention of religion. Dave Hill replies: Oh really? He was also caught on camera by the BBC advocating \"option 3\" to a member of the public. CentreforLondon suggests: One effective way of reducing congestion on London's roads would be to lift the ban on night-time deliveries and encourage lorries to use our under-used roads at night. The current prohibition on night time delivery is a hang over from the 1980s. Our streets are a lot more crowded now than then, and vehicles have got quieter. Moreover new technology makes it much easier to enforce noise restrictions. Discouraging freight during the day could also make our roads safer. Around two thirds of bike deaths on London roads in 2010 involved heavy goods vehicles. Dave Hill replies: Thank you for yet another fine contribution. The following might be of interest: Night-time deliveries during the London 2012 Games are a viable option, according to Transport for London (TfL), which has been conducting a series of out-of-hours delivery trials across London boroughs with a range of businesses, including supermarkets, pubs and hotels. Following the trials, TfL has produced a draft Code of Practice, developed in partnership with the Freight Transport Association (FTA) and the Noise Abatement Society, that sets out practical tips for drivers and those receiving goods on making deliveries as quiet as possible. Now read on. SpursSupporter suggests: \"That a hefty 35% of journey stages in the capital are still taken by car\" Statistics like this which lump all of Lodnon together don't really add much to the debate. Most public transport routes, particulrly trains and the tube, are aligned to the rush hour movements of people into central London from the outskirts. What is hard to do by public transport is to travel around the outskirts which is often what people want to do. Hence, they use cars. Also, cars are cheap compared to public transport if there are several people in the car and you can carry shopping door-to-door. These days people do a weekly shop for food - 50 years ago they would have shopped several times a week buying smaller quantities. All of these things are much easier by car. Frankly, I find it hard to see how any public transport system could cope with these types of demand, so cars will always be in the frame. Dave Hill replies: Hi. I thought people would get bored if I went into the stats in detail and at length, but you can find lots more in TfL's latest Travel In London report (number 4, available via here.) I just wanted to make the point that motor vehicle use really matters to a lot of Londoners and that any measures to regulate car/road use more, whether through pricing mechanisms or any other, have to fully acknowledge this. That's just one reason why the issue is difficult. lordsandwich suggests: One of the issues with public transport is that it's virtually unusable during night hours (when the car is fundamental). Night buses have limited routes and frankly, if you have ever used them, they're full of drunk people, so it's not really a pleasant journey. They only run every 30 minutes, so if you have to take two, it would take a long time to get home. The car here is the only viable alternative. Why couldn't they run two or three underground lines (say one from East-west like the central and one north-south like the northern) during the night? They could keep on alternating between them so maintenance can be done. Clubbing the motorists with more tax will really hurt those that need the car such as people with young families, or thoes that live in the suburbs. Having an expensive congestion charge for large vehicles will particularly hit larger families. We already have road pricing (like the greens want), it's called fuel tax. The more you drive, the more tax you pay. As far as I know, most of the pollution is caused by utility vehicles. Perhaps confining them to few roads and increasing the congestion charge on them (to incentivise large supermakets and other shops to move to the outskirts) could be a good idea. Finally, it would be good if we had more flexible working, so we don't all turn up at the same time. Most traffic problems only exist during peak time. I don't know how much the London mayor can do about this though. In the interest of full disclosure, I don't own a car and I live in central London. Dave Hill replies: Morning. Or afternoon, even. On long/later public transport, Boris has had to abandon an election pledge to have the Tube run for just one hour later at weekends only. He explained that upgrade works made it impossible at present. My only point here is that it's tricky. Personally, I don't favour singling out larger domestic vehicles for a higher congestion charge, as Ken would (and just because I have six kids). One point on the report done for the Greens is that its authors envisaged a lower price for central London than is raised at present. Your \"tax\" point gets us into a whole other debate! My take on that is here. Thanks for your other thoughts too. mespilus suggests: Looking at the volume of traffic pouring into London on the two main arterial routes closest to me, the A40 and M4, I would propose an 'M25' tax. If you live outside the M25, and cross it by private vehicle you pay to pollute outer London as well as central London. Dave Hill replies: Brian Paddick proposed something similar during the last mayoral election campaign. As the Standard reported: Tourists and out-of-town commuters would be charged \u00a310 for driving into Greater London under plans unveiled by Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate Brian Paddick...Mr Paddick said: \"A Greater London congestion charge will have a real impact on congestion and pollution. This is about getting people out of their cars and on to public transport. This will make a significant contribution to improving London's public transport system, in the suburbs as well as in the centre.\" He also vowed to scrap the Low Emission Zone because it penalised small businesses. The objection, of course, is that it would deter visitors and therefore damage London's economy. notmyusername suggests: I heartily recommend the London Reconnections blog for some very detailed analysis of London rail (and some road) transport issues. It is very technical in places, however! The big, big problem with the tube is that it is entirely at capacity - boring new tunnels in the centre of the city is very hard and very expensive. Crossrail is going to alleviate things to some extent, but the big capacity increases have come from the London Overground services, and even they are going to be filled up very soon. With regards your hub &amp; spoke arrangement, this is what you already have with your national rail services. The difficulties arise when these passengers need to transit in and around London - extending the underground out to the m25 would just shift the problem, as well as degrading services - because of the capacity issues, you simply can't have stopping/non-stopping services sharing single lines. Dave Hill replies: I second your recommendation. mug2009 suggests: Solve London's traffic problems easy ! 1] Make congestion charge start within m25 Very high charge say \u00a365 per day 2] at all arterial junctions of m25 dig big underground car parks [ must be cheap say \u00a30.5 per hour] 3] use liberated lanes for high speed shuttle services [ again cheap say \u00a32 for shuttle from junction to centre] and build eventually tube stations 4] flexibility and free parking everywhere in zone from midnight friday to midnight sunday 5] concessions for disabled etc etc As a long term London resident it is very clear that the congestion is caused by visitors not residents so that is where the focus should be . We want Visitors so lets make it cheap and easy for them to get around . All the punitive policies don't work and only create a hassle factor that means people would rather not come . Self defeating ! PLEASE PLEASE MR CANDIDATE OF WHATEVER POLITICAL STRIPE ADOPT THIS PROPOSAL YOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE Dave Hill replies: Phew. A \u00a365 congestion charge proposal would certainly set the cat among the pigeons. A massive park-and-ride scheme would meet with local opposition, even if the car parks were underground. Are you thinking green belt here? You're very bold, though. Nothing wrong with that.",

These days people do a weekly shop for food - 50 years ago they would have shopped several times a week buying smaller quantities. All of these things are much easier by car.<br>Frankly, I find it hard to see how any public transport system could cope with these types of demand, so cars will always be in the frame.</p> <h2><strong>Dave Hill replies:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387342991\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330948599867/DaveHill-001.jpg\" alt=\"DaveHill\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DaveHill Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hi. I thought people would get bored if I went into the stats in detail and at length, but you can find lots more in TfL's latest Travel In London report (number 4, available via <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/publications/1482.aspx\">here.</a>) I just wanted to make the point that motor vehicle use really matters to a lot of Londoners and that any measures to regulate car/road use more, whether through pricing mechanisms or any other, have to fully acknowledge this. That's just one reason why the issue is difficult.</p> <h2><strong>lordsandwich suggests:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387342992\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330949856201/greyavatar-001.jpg\" alt=\"greyavatar\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">greyavatar Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the issues with public transport is that it's virtually unusable during night hours (when the car is fundamental). Night buses have limited routes and frankly, if you have ever used them, they're full of drunk people, so it's not really a pleasant journey. They only run every 30 minutes, so if you have to take two, it would take a long time to get home. The car here is the only viable alternative.<br>Why couldn't they run two or three underground lines (say one from East-west like the central and one north-south like the northern) during the night? They could keep on alternating between them so maintenance can be done.<br>Clubbing the motorists with more tax will really hurt those that need the car such as people with young families, or thoes that live in the suburbs. Having an expensive congestion charge for large vehicles will particularly hit larger families.<br>We already have road pricing (like the greens want), it's called fuel tax. The more you drive, the more tax you pay.<br>As far as I know, most of the pollution is caused by utility vehicles. Perhaps confining them to few roads and increasing the congestion charge on them (to incentivise large supermakets and other shops to move to the outskirts) could be a good idea.<br>Finally, it would be good if we had more flexible working, so we don't all turn up at the same time. Most traffic problems only exist during peak time. I don't know how much the London mayor can do about this though.<br>In the interest of full disclosure, I don't own a car and I live in central London.</p> <h2><strong>Dave Hill replies:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387342993\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/5/1330948599867/DaveHill-001.jpg\" alt=\"DaveHill\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DaveHill Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morning.

      "bodyText": "Capturing the truth about water is a challenge for the photographer, especially when the news is dominated by drought and the dominant picture is the visual clich\u00e9 of cracked mud in a drying-out reservoir or river. It's a powerful image conveying strongly the idea that lack of water is clearly not a good thing, but it's the single image which probably does more to mislead about the biology of freshwater than any other. Of course if you're a drought struck farmer, or a stranded fish, droughts are very bad news. But for about half of all freshwater plants and animals, droughts are harmless or even necessary and beneficial. On their own, there's not much evidence that droughts cause permanent damage to wildlife. So a good photographic project would be to document the natural drying down of a seasonal pond, showing it through the year as water levels drop, the pond bottom greens over with the shoots of marginal wetland plants and transforms into a dry land habitat for the summer. Many of our wetland plants \u2013 the white-flowered water crowfoots are a good example \u2013 naturally grow in places which dry out for part of the year, and capturing the early flowering in spring will supply you with plenty of good close-up projects. The other major story to convey about life in freshwater is the threat from pollution, and the near complete elimination of clean water from the landscape. With this has come the extinction of pollution-sensitive plants and animals from great swathes of the countryside, leaving our ponds and rivers in a poor and degraded state. Documenting pollution is difficult photographically because the effects are seen mostly under water and often reveal themselves by an absence of sensitive species, or a superabundance of the tolerant few that thrive on the excess of pollutants. The green and turbid water of a polluted pond or slow-flowing river is difficult to make both striking and honest. Alternatively, look for the pollution sensitive-plants which are still hanging on in isolated pockets of clean water, that highlight what has disappeared from the landscape. For example, the early spring flowers of water-violet or the rich green underwater foliage of carnivorous bladderworts. Both need the cleanest water, either in ponds or the ditches which criss-cross freshwater marshes at the coast, or in upland lakes. Getting good pictures of plants underwater needs a polarising filter to cut out the reflections and brighten up the plants. Make a special effort to look for the smaller waters. It's only in the past 10 years have we realised that in the UK, the smallest ponds support a wider variety of plants and animals than the biggest rivers \u2013 yet we pay little attention to these small and abundant waters that are so important for our freshwater wildlife. Capturing the richness of life that epitomise the best of our freshwaters \u2013 the dragonflies, water beetles, pond snails and mayflies \u2013 requires real natural history skills, combined with a macro lens of some kind. It's now possible to buy pretty inexpensive waterproof cameras that allow experimentation with underwater shots in situ, though the best pictures tend to come from small tank set-ups. And if you haven't got time to wait for the perfect kingfisher shot, look out for an easier target that's just as beautiful \u2013 such as the delicate and dipping grey wagtails on your local stream. They are not really grey at all but have brilliant yellow bellies and striking grey and white patterns \u2013 a photographic dream.

      "body": "<p>Capturing the truth about water is a challenge for the photographer, especially when the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/24/hosepipe-bans-uk-drought\" title=\"\">news is dominated by drought</a> and the dominant picture is the visual clich\u00e9 of cracked mud in a drying-out reservoir or river.</p> <p>It's a powerful image conveying strongly the idea that lack of water is clearly not a good thing, but it's the single image which probably does more to mislead about the biology of freshwater than any other.</p> <p>Of course if you're a drought struck farmer, or a stranded fish, droughts are very bad news. But for about half of all freshwater plants and animals, droughts are harmless or even necessary and beneficial. On their own, there's not much evidence that droughts cause permanent damage to wildlife.</p> <p>So a good photographic project would be to document the natural drying down of a seasonal pond, showing it through the year as water levels drop, the pond bottom greens over with the shoots of marginal wetland plants and transforms into a dry land habitat for the summer. Many of our wetland plants \u2013 the white-flowered water crowfoots are a good example \u2013 naturally grow in places which dry out for part of the year, and capturing the early flowering in spring will supply you with plenty of good close-up projects.</p> <p>The other major story to convey about life in freshwater is the threat from pollution, and the near complete elimination of clean water from the landscape. With this has come the extinction of pollution-sensitive plants and animals from great swathes of the countryside, leaving our ponds and rivers in a poor and degraded state.</p> <p>Documenting pollution is difficult photographically because the effects are seen mostly under water and often reveal themselves by an absence of sensitive species, or a superabundance of the tolerant few that thrive on the excess of pollutants. The green and turbid water of a polluted pond or slow-flowing river is difficult to make both striking and honest.</p> <p>Alternatively, look for the pollution sensitive-plants which are still hanging on in isolated pockets of clean water, that highlight what has disappeared from the landscape. For example, the early spring flowers of water-violet or the rich green underwater foliage of carnivorous bladderworts. Both need the cleanest water, either in ponds or the ditches which criss-cross freshwater marshes at the coast, or in upland lakes. Getting good pictures of plants underwater needs a polarising filter to cut out the reflections and brighten up the plants.</p> <p>Make a special effort to look for the smaller waters. It's only in the past 10 years have we realised that in the UK, the smallest ponds support a wider variety of plants and animals than the biggest rivers \u2013 yet we pay little attention to these small and abundant waters that are so important for our freshwater wildlife.</p> <p>Capturing the richness of life that epitomise the best of our freshwaters \u2013 the dragonflies, water beetles, pond snails and mayflies \u2013 requires real natural history skills, combined with a macro lens of some kind. It's now possible to buy pretty inexpensive waterproof cameras that allow experimentation with underwater shots in situ, though the best pictures tend to come from small tank set-ups.</p> <p>And if you haven't got time to wait for the perfect kingfisher shot, look out for an easier target that's just as beautiful \u2013 such as the delicate and dipping <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/g/greywagtail/index.aspx\" title=\"\">grey wagtails</a> on your local stream. They are not really grey at all but have brilliant yellow bellies and striking grey and white patterns \u2013 a photographic dream.

      "bodyText": "Homeowners worried about rising standard variable rates (SVRs) could be locked out of the best deals on the market because falling house prices and changes in lenders' rules mean they no longer qualify for a new mortgage. Britain's largest lender, the Halifax, recently revealed it was increasing its SVR by 0.49% to 3.99% on 1 May, which will mean higher monthly repayments for approximately 850,000 borrowers. The Bank of Ireland's UK arm is also increasing its SVR, which is currently 2.99%, to 3.99% in June and then to 4.49% in September, affecting about 100,000 customers. However, there are options available to many of these people, and others who may find themselves in a similar position, including remortgaging to another lender or transferring to a different deal offered by the same bank or building society. It is unclear how many UK borrowers are on their lenders' SVRs, but at the end of 2010 the Council of Mortgage Lenders said about 1.8 million borrowers had come to the end of a fixed-rate mortgage and moved on to their lenders' SVRs. Although more up-to-date figures are not available, the CML said \"logic would suggest\" there were more people on SVRs, as \"there has been little incentive for people to remortgage on to a fixed rate\". The Halifax said customers who want to avoid the rate rise and fix their monthly costs can switch to a two-year fixed-rate mortgage. The is available to borrowers with loans of up to 120% of the value of their property; however, those borrowing more than 75% on an interest-only basis will not qualify for the switch and could struggle to find another lender willing to take them on. Stuart Gregory, a broker at Lentune Mortgage Consultancy, says: \"I've got big concerns for borrowers. Lending criteria have changed dramatically, and different income requirements and rules on interest-only mortgages are going to cause some people problems.\" Mark Harris, chief executive of broker SPF Private Clients, says the problem many borrowers face is lack of equity, particularly if the value of their home has fallen in the past few years. \"This may make remortgaging difficult and mean you don't qualify for the cheapest rates,\" he adds. Land Registry figures show house prices across England and Wales fell by 11% between their peak in February 2008 and the start of 2012, and in some areas the drops have been considerably bigger. This means someone who took a 90% mortgage on their property four years ago could now be in negative equity, while even those who put down substantial deposits could now need to borrow at a high loan-to-value (LTV). Harris says anyone in this situation who wants to remortgage to protect themselves against SVR moves should look at the rest of their finances to see if they are able to increase the equity in their home. \"If you have savings earning next to no interest, you could consider paying off a chunk of the mortgage, which should make remortgaging easier,\" he says. However, he advises: \"Make sure you keep some money back for emergencies, as money overpaid on the mortgage is difficult to get back again.\" Harris says Halifax's move brought its SVR into line with other lenders' pricing, so he did not expect to see a large number of other lenders raising rates. However, he warned: \"Anyone on their lender's SVR is at risk of a hike in payments, so it's worth constantly monitoring the situation and moving if you can when the time is right. Overpaying in the meantime is a useful strategy to improve your equity stake.\" Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol says changes to interest-only requirements could also cause problems for some borrowers, with Santander, Lloyds and Woolwich among lenders that have recently tightened their rules for borrowers on these kinds of deals. Santander, for example, has reduced its maximum lending on an interest-only basis to 50% LTV, while Woolwich and Lloyds now specify certain repayment vehicles. \"If you have an interest-only mortgage, you need to ask which lender can I switch to and who has the best rate, not who has the best rate, as you could five years ago,\" he says. Existing customers will usually be considered for a product transfer, though, as long as they do not want to increase their borrowing at the same time. Boulger says these product transfers \u2013 moves to another deal offered by your lender \u2013 will often remain an option, even for borrowers whose circumstances have changed, and in some cases they may be worth considering. At Halifax, for example, the fee-free switch available to a two-year fixed-rate of 3.49% for borrowers with 40% deposits may be worthwhile if you cannot move elsewhere. If you can move and want to fix, Boulger points to a five-year fixed-rate deal at Chelsea building society currently priced at 3.29%. Boulger believes interest rates are unlikely to change in the near future, so some borrowers may want to stay put. But he says: \"The higher your SVR, the more worthwhile it is to switch. If your rate is between 4.5% and 6%, as many building societies are, even with just 15% equity you are going to be able to switch to a deal that is better. At a rate of 6%, even if you only have 10% equity it could still be worthwhile.\"",

He has written a frank autobiography, The Accidental Editor, admitting that he wasn't up to the job of running a regional daily newspaper. Harris, now 62, managed to survive for three and half years as editor until he was fired in 1993. He said: \"I quickly discovered I wasn't up to being editor.\" Before publishing his book he obtained permission from his former boss, CN Group managing director Robin Burgess, because it necessitated the lifting of a confidentiality clause. And Burgess graciously agreed. Harris told HoldTheFrontPage: \"Lots of ex-editors write their memoirs but mine is a little bit different... because it ends in the sort of failure that a lot of us prefer not to talk about. \"And it's also a bit different because I'd never wanted to be a journalist until I was one.\" The book tells of his joining the weekly Weston-super-Mare Mercury in his native Somerset aged 18, but only because it seemed a better bet than shovelling horse manure on a mushroom farm. After a spell on the Western Daily Press in Bristol he moved as a features sub to the Evening Post in Nottingham. It was there that editor Barrie Williams spotted a talent in Harris he hadn't noticed in himself. That led to his appointment in Carlisle. He continues to live in the city and works as a freelance covering the crown court and filing to his old paper \"I never wanted to be a journalist,\" he said, \"but I have loved every minute of it.\" I ought also to point out that some of the comments on the HoldTheFrontPage site miss the point entirely. Harris was not asked to make cuts, nor did he suffer from management interference in editorial affairs. Indeed, given that he knew he wasn't up to the job, it seems unduly benign of the CN Group to have kept him in his post for more than three years! Source: HoldTheFrontPage",

The Occupy camp was set up last October in solidarity with the campaigners who had occupied Wall Street in New York and the area outside St Paul's Cathedral in London. Protesters plan to hold a demonstration at the Central Bank later on Thursday and said the removal of the camp did not mean the end of the Occupy movement. Just after 7am the streets were reopened around the Central Bank and protesters were allowed to return to the site. Ireland's minister for tourism, Leo Varadkar, said it was regrettable that those involved in the protest would not consider relocating for a few days during the St Patrick's Day festival celebrations. Garda\u00ed and a number of Irish celebrities including the former Leeds United player Johnny Giles have appealed to Occupy to suspend their camp protest in order to facilitate the annual St Patrick's Day parade which passes by the Central Bank en route to O'Connell Street. Giles is this year's honorary marshal who will lead the St Patrick's Day procession through the Irish capital.",

      "bodyText": "The Press Complaints Commission is to be shut down after 21 years, closing one of the most controversial chapters in the history of self regulation of the UK newspaper industry. The watchdog, which was fatally wounded by its response to the phone-hacking scandal, has confirmed that it will formally close and be replaced with a transitional body which will take charge of press regulation until a new system is set up in the wake of the Leveson inquiry. The long-term replacement for the PCC is not expected to be up and running for at least a year and may not be in place until 2014 if statutes are needed for a proposed arbitration unit offering a libel resolution service. In the meantime the newspaper industry has decided that closing the existing self-regulatory body will offer the press a clean break from the past and an opportunity to regain the confidence of the public. An accelerated shutdown of the PCC was agreed earlier this year and formally approved at a meeting of the commission on Wednesday. The PCC chairman, Lord Hunt, told Sky News at the end of February that a decision in principle to move to a new body had been taken. \"So we're very much now on the front foot and listening to all sides and determined to bring forward the sort of independent self-regulatory structure that everyone will approve of,\" he said then. Lord Hunt may have to reapply for his job once the transition process is complete, PCC insiders indicated. For now, the transition body will not have a full-time director to replace the recently departed Stig Abell \u2013 and instead be run by three people, Michael McManus, a former Conservative special adviser, who is director of transition, with Jonathan Collett, the director of communications, who has previously acted as press adviser to former Conservative leader Michael Howard, and Charlotte Dewar, the head of complaints who previously worked at the Guardian. Richard Desmond's Express and Star titles, the only major publisher to have been outside the PCC, remain in negotiations to sign up to the successor body. The idea is that all publishers will sign up to the new body via a contract, lasting several years, which will give the new body greater powers of sanction over errant publishers. Their transition body will take on the assets and liabilities of the old PCC. Its name has not yet been determined and the body is canvassing for suggestions. The name of the new body and its structure have not been finalised but Hunt said the parts of the PCC that had worked would be retained, including the complaints resolution service. \"I'm determined that we should make sure that we still keep those procedures which 80%, 85% of people who have used them have found so helpful \u2013 pre-publication action and various other ways,\" he said. He confirmed that the industry was working on long-term proposals for a replacement regulator which would have three units: one dealing with standards and compliance, one representing complaints and mediation and one offering legally binding solutions to libel complaints through arbitration. The libel unit is creating the most debate at the Leveson inquiry. Legally it is not clear if a cheap and quick libel service can be set up without statutory changes. The industry is divided between those who accept that some form of statutory underpinning for the new regulatory system is needed, and others who warn that it would be a slippery slope towards government control of the press. Significant questions remain about whether a regulator can force a potential litigant to accept arbitration instead of taking court action. Lionel Barber, the editor of the Financial Times, is among those who have warned that a self-regulated arbitration unit would not be attractive to big City firms or Russian oligarchs who have the money to fund high court libel actions, which can cost newspapers millions to defend. Lord Justice Leveson is expected to publish his findings in October and may recommend some sort of statutory regulation to enable a new body to include a legally binding libel arbitration arm. The Liberal Democrats are pushing for parliamentary time to be reserved early next year to discuss the Leveson report so potential legislation could be introduced into parliament the following year.",

And where once they were mentored by Korn, this time they're getting a hand from Lil Wayne. Wayne's Cash Money label signed Limp Bizkit last month, and now the band's singer, Fred Durst, has announced his intentions for the band's comeback. \"[I'm going] to make my rock music in a hip-hop fashion,\" he told Billboard. Wayne has already recorded a cameo on the group's new single, Ready to Go, which they intend to release as a free download. Ready to Go was produced by Love in this Club's Polow Da Don, and is just the first volley in Durst's plans for a rock band that works as rap and R&amp;B stars do \u2013 flying in to meet with producers, recording, and flying out. \"You just come in and you're there and you give it 110% for 12 hours, 24, 36 hours and you leave with a song. That's the vibe. You go in and walk out with a monster and keep moving forward song after song.\" It's an unlikely reinvention for Limp Bizkit, who seemed destined for a rap-rock retirement home, despite reuniting in 2009. Although their first four albums were blockbusters, a 2005 LP barely broke the US top 25, and 2011's Gold Cobra creaked in at No 16. They haven't had a mainstream charting single since 2003's Behind Blue Eyes. Nevertheless, Cash Money sees something in the combination of Durst, now 41, and the band's guitarist, Wes Borland. The \"crazy metal record\" is intended to balance out the group's hip-hop experimentalism, Durst said: \"[It] will service our core and counter-balance these big, fat, ginormous hip-rock songs we're going to do.\" The music will probably be released as an EP called The Unquestionable Truth, Part 2. \"We want to let everybody know this is just an introduction,\" Durst said. Now that Limp Bizkit and Cash Money \"are living together,\" he said, \"now that we're married, we'll see what happens when we start doing more \u2026 I've been waiting my whole life for this type of feeling.\"",

      "bodyText": "Lawrence Hills is one of my heroes. Best known as the founder of the organic gardening charity Garden Organic (formerly the HDRA), he was also a prolific author. I'm always surprised at how little attention his masterly books on organic gardening attract, as for me his work Organic Gardening provided the backbone of my understanding of natural growing techniques. Admittedly, modern organic gardeners may frown on his habit of scouring ashtrays in bars for cigarette butts to make a biodegradable nicotine pesticide, and I'm not sure it would still be wise to collect hair clippings from the barber's shop to feed your fruit bushes, given the chemicals they may now contain. But he had a deep understanding of the cycling of nutrients, and a remarkable attention to detail in the garden. Hills was obsessed with comfrey - the easy to grow, robust plant that has an astonishing range of uses. He named his gardening organisation after the forgotten man who spent years researching the benefits of comfrey, Henry Doubleday. And he also wrote an entire book about comfrey. Comfrey has very deep roots that reach into the subsoil to draw up plant nutrients, which are then made available in its leaves. Here at The Oak Tree we use the leaves of the gardener's favourite variety of comfrey, \"Bocking 14\" (developed by Hills) as mulch around \"demanding\" vegetables such as tomatoes and French beans. Comfrey also has medicinal properties, as its folk name \"knitbone\" suggests. I have helped to heal a mashed finger more than once by binding grated comfrey root against the skin. We are now planting a double strip of comfrey alongside the entire length of the path that divides our vegetable growing area in two, over 100m in length. This is, in part, thanks to comfrey's third use as animal fodder, rich in minerals and protein. We plan to feed it to the pigs, as well as to our new chickens that are due to arrive later this month. Joanne Mudhar runs The Oak Tree Low Carbon Farm in Ipswich, Suffolk.

But he had a deep understanding of the cycling of nutrients, and a remarkable attention to detail in the garden.</p> <p>Hills was obsessed with comfrey - the easy to grow, robust plant that has an astonishing range of uses. He named his gardening organisation after the forgotten man who spent years researching the benefits of comfrey, Henry Doubleday. And he also wrote an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/06/comfrey-gardens\">entire book about comfrey</a>. </p> <p>Comfrey has very deep roots that reach into the subsoil to draw up plant nutrients, which are then made available in its leaves. Here at The Oak Tree we use the leaves of the gardener's favourite variety of comfrey, <a href=\"http://www.organiccatalogue.com/p1116/COMFREY-PLANTS-Bocking-14-Pack-of-10-Spring-2012/product_info.html\">\"Bocking 14\"</a> (developed by Hills) as mulch around \"demanding\" vegetables such as tomatoes and French beans. Comfrey also has medicinal properties, as its folk name \"knitbone\" suggests. I have helped to heal a mashed finger more than once by binding grated comfrey root against the skin. </p> <p>We are now planting a double strip of comfrey alongside the entire length of the path that divides our vegetable growing area in two, over 100m in length. This is, in part, thanks to comfrey's third use as animal fodder, rich in minerals and protein. We plan to feed it to the pigs, as well as to our new chickens that are due to arrive later this month.</p> <p><em>Joanne Mudhar runs <a href=\"http://www.the-oak-tree.co.uk/\">The Oak Tree Low Carbon Farm</a> in Ipswich, Suffolk</em>.</p> <h2>Garden Crafts for Children competition</h2> <p>Congratulations to Beverley Barnes of Liverpool, Joanne Homer of Lancashire, Barbara Chambers of Sheffield, Cara Holmes of Bridgend and Layla Fletcher of Northolt who each won a copy of Dawn Isaac's Garden Crafts for Children in our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/competition/2012/feb/01/garden-crafts-children-competition\">recent competition</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This sounds like faint praise, but the biggest news for developers from the unveiling of Apple's new iPad may be the company's decision to lop \u00a370 off the price of the previous model. Selling the iPad 2 for \u00a3329 in the UK ($399 in the US) has the potential to expand the userbase for Apple's tablet, in the same way that the still-available iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 have done for the company's smartphone. For developers still mulling whether to invest more in making tablet apps, the price drop could be the tipping point. That said, be wary of any claims that the cheaper iPad 2 will suck developers away from Android. The two most interesting Android tablets for many developers \u2013 Amazon's Kindle Fire and Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook Tablet \u2013 start at $199 in the US. Anyway, what about that new iPad, and its implications for developers? The most obvious impact is for games, as shown by the two titles demonstrated at the launch: Namco's Sky Gamblers Air Supremacy, and Epic Games' Infinity Blade Dungeons. Developers with the necessary resources will be licking their lips at the prospect of making use of the new iPad's Retina display, quad-core A5X processor and rumoured 1GB of RAM for beefier, better-looking games. Expect the phrase \"console-quality\" to be hurled around a lot in the coming months. The new iPad won't be the only quad-core tablet by any means, but the key here will be its reach \u2013 the quicker it reaches a significant install base, the more developers will be able to justify the investment required to make these kinds of games. An important point: these are only a certain portion of the iPad games market. Apple's own chart for the top 25 all-time paid apps on iPad in the UK is stuffed with games like Angry Birds, Scrabble and Monopoly, Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope, which have always been about accessible gameplay rather than graphical horsepower. These kinds of games will sharpen up for the Retina display, of course, but that's evolution rather than revolution for their developers. The fact that Autodesk's SketchBook Ink was the third new app demonstrated at the new iPad's launch shows potential for art and creativity apps with the new screen and beefier processor, too. \"Professional and everyday artists are going to love this device, and it's going to inspire them to create beautiful pieces of artwork,\" said Autodesk's Chris Cheung at the launch. Remember that debate about iPad (and, indeed, tablets in general) being just for consumption rather than creativity? We'll see more apps coming out that will continue the process of laying that notion to rest. Look at the push made by Adobe into tablet apps in recent times, and think about what it might do now with the new iPad and comparable devices. I was interested in the fact that all three of these apps were specifically referred to as iOS exclusives at the event, and wonder whether this is something Apple is pushing for more overtly in its dealings with developers. Then again, exclusivity may simply be what's required to get a slot on-stage during an Apple keynote. It's too early to say what impact the new device will have on apps from the media industry. Will that Retina display make new iPad owners more likely to subscribe to digital magazines and newspapers, or use apps like Netflix and BBC iPlayer? Another area \u2013 tablet-based augmented reality \u2013 should also benefit from the much-better rear camera in the new iPad. But this is very much a niche for now. Of more practical use to most iOS developers is the news that emerged after the launch event, that Apple has increased the download-size limit on apps downloaded over a mobile network (as opposed to Wi-Fi) from 20MB to 50MB. Even so, the big takeaways from the launch are more about the wider competitive landscape: not just how the iPad compares to its closest Android rivals, but where it sits in the context of computing as a whole. Apple chief executive Tim Cook took a direct swipe at Android during his presentation, criticising \"blown-up smartphone\" apps for Twitter and Yelp on Google-powered tablets, and comparing them to the slicker versions on iPad. It was a well-aimed blow: those tablets are easily capable of running the better versions, so why aren't developers providing them? Note, though, that Cook didn't show, say, the Kindle Fire version of Twitter, which is better. The big thing for developers to chew over is what Cook describes as \"the post-PC revolution\" \u2013 an idea that book-ended the launch event. \"A world where the PC is no longer the centre of your digital world, but rather just a device,\" said Cook. \"We're talking about a world where your new devices, the devices you use the most, need to be more portable, more personal and dramatically easier to use than any PC has ever been.\" It's this shift \u2013 which is not just an Apple thing \u2013 that is disrupting the businesses of established software firms and providing big opportunities for new startups and developers. With that in mind, all eyes will now be on Apple's WWDC conference this summer, as well as corresponding events from Google, Microsoft and others, for more pointers on how this post-PC shift is guiding the evolution of their platforms. Or, to put it another way: it's fun to chew over the implications of the new iPad hardware for developers. But the real meat will come with iOS 6, Android 5, Windows 8 and other software in the months to come.",

      "body": "<p>This sounds like faint praise, but the biggest news for developers from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/07/ipad-apple\">unveiling of Apple's new iPad</a> may be the company's decision to lop \u00a370 off the price of the previous model.</p> <p>Selling the iPad 2 for \u00a3329 in the UK ($399 in the US) has the potential to expand the userbase for Apple's tablet, in the same way that the still-available iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 have done for the company's smartphone.</p> <p>For developers still mulling whether to invest more in making tablet apps, the price drop could be the tipping point.</p> <p>That said, be wary of any claims that the cheaper iPad 2 will suck developers away from Android. The two most interesting Android tablets for many developers \u2013&#xa0;Amazon's Kindle Fire and Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook Tablet \u2013&#xa0;start at $199 in the US.</p> <p>Anyway, what about that new iPad, and its implications for developers? The most obvious impact is for games, as shown by the two titles demonstrated at the launch: Namco's Sky Gamblers Air Supremacy, and Epic Games' Infinity Blade Dungeons.</p> <p>Developers with the necessary resources will be licking their lips at the prospect of making use of the new iPad's Retina display, quad-core A5X processor and rumoured 1GB of RAM for beefier, better-looking games.</p> <p>Expect the phrase \"console-quality\" to be hurled around a lot in the coming months. The new iPad won't be the only quad-core tablet by any means, but the key here will be its reach \u2013&#xa0;the quicker it reaches a significant install base, the more developers will be able to justify the investment required to make these kinds of games.</p> <p>An important point: these are only a certain portion of the iPad games market. Apple's own chart for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/mar/07/apple-uk-iphone-ipad-charts\">top 25 all-time paid apps on iPad</a> in the UK is stuffed with games like Angry Birds, Scrabble and Monopoly, Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope, which have always been about accessible gameplay rather than graphical horsepower. </p> <p>These kinds of games will sharpen up for the Retina display, of course, but that's evolution rather than revolution for their developers.</p> <p>The fact that Autodesk's SketchBook Ink was the third new app demonstrated at the new iPad's launch shows potential for art and creativity apps with the new screen and beefier processor, too. \"Professional and everyday artists are going to love this device, and it's going to inspire them to create beautiful pieces of artwork,\" said Autodesk's Chris Cheung at the launch.</p> <p>Remember that debate about iPad (and, indeed, tablets in general) being just for consumption rather than creativity? We'll see more apps coming out that will continue the process of laying that notion to rest. Look at the push made by Adobe into tablet apps in recent times, and think about what it might do now with the new iPad and comparable devices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387075732\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/8/1331203514475/infinity-blade-dungeons.jpg\" alt=\"Infinity Blade Dungeons\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infinity Blade Dungeons shows off the new iPad's graphical heft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was interested in the fact that all three of these apps were specifically referred to as iOS exclusives at the event, and wonder whether this is something Apple is pushing for more overtly in its dealings with developers. Then again, exclusivity may simply be what's required to get a slot on-stage during an Apple keynote.</p> <p>It's too early to say what impact the new device will have on apps from the media industry. Will that Retina display make new iPad owners more likely to subscribe to digital magazines and newspapers, or use apps like Netflix and BBC iPlayer?</p> <p>Another area \u2013 tablet-based augmented reality \u2013&#xa0;should also benefit from the much-better rear camera in the new iPad. But this is very much a niche for now.</p> <p>Of more practical use to most iOS developers is the news that emerged after the launch event, that Apple has <a href=\"http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/03/apple-increases-app-download-limit-to-a-massive-50mbs\">increased the download-size limit</a> on apps downloaded over a mobile network (as opposed to Wi-Fi) from 20MB to 50MB.</p> <p>Even so, the big takeaways from the launch are more about the wider competitive landscape: not just how the iPad compares to its closest Android rivals, but where it sits in the context of computing as a whole.</p> <p>Apple chief executive Tim Cook took a direct swipe at Android during his presentation, criticising \"blown-up smartphone\" apps for Twitter and Yelp on Google-powered tablets, and comparing them to the slicker versions on iPad.</p> <p>It was a well-aimed blow: those tablets are easily capable of running the better versions, so why aren't developers providing them? Note, though, that Cook didn't show, say, the Kindle Fire version of Twitter, which is better.</p> <p>The big thing for developers to chew over is what Cook describes as \"the post-PC revolution\" \u2013&#xa0;an idea that book-ended the launch event.</p> <p>\"A world where the PC is no longer the centre of your digital world, but rather just a device,\" said Cook. \"We're talking about a world where your new devices, the devices you use the most, need to be more portable, more personal and dramatically easier to use than any PC has ever been.\"</p> <p>It's this shift \u2013&#xa0;which is not just an Apple thing \u2013&#xa0;that is disrupting the businesses of established software firms and providing big opportunities for new startups and developers.</p> <p>With that in mind, all eyes will now be on Apple's WWDC conference this summer, as well as corresponding events from Google, Microsoft and others, for more pointers on how this post-PC shift is guiding the evolution of their platforms.</p> <p>Or, to put it another way: it's fun to chew over the implications of the new iPad hardware for developers.

      "bodyText": "The commanding officer of the six men killed when their armoured vehicle was hit by a massive explosion in Afghanistan has paid tribute to the soldiers and insisted the regiment remained committed to its mission. Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning said the six men, five of whom were aged between 19 and 21, were \"incredibly brave\" and would expect their comrades to continue to do their duty. Speaking outside Battlesbury barracks in Warminster, Wiltshire, Stenning said: \"Barely 48 hours ago, we heard the terrible news that six soldiers from The 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, were declared missing, believed killed, after their Warrior armoured vehicle was caught in an explosion in southern Afghanistan. \"As their commanding officer of a tight knit family regiment, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my incredibly brave men, and to offer my deepest condolences to their families, and to their many friends.\" He said a few words about each of the men. Stenning described the youngest, Private Christopher Kershaw, 19, as a \"true Yorkshire warrior...a star of the future.\" The oldest, Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, was \"quite simply the best.\" Stenning added: \"Six of our brothers have fallen. It has been a sad day but as their brothers in arms we remain committed in our duty to continue with our mission. They would want nothing less. Our loss is very great today but this of course is nothing compared with the deep loss felt by their families and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are firmly with them today.\" Two of the six came from Huddersfield in West Yorkshire and the town's MP, Barry Sheerman, called for a fresh Commons debate on operations in Afghanistan. He said he did not believe Britain should \"cut and run\" from the mission but said this week's events should bring the war back on to parliament's agenda. The deaths take the toll of British personnel killed in Afghanistan to 404 and represent the biggest loss of UK life in a single incident in Afghanistan since 2006, when an ageing RAF Nimrod crashed shortly after midair refuelling, with the loss of all 14 people aboard. Passing the symbolic milestone of 400 deaths has refocused attention on the reason for the presence of British troops in Afghanistan, the timetable for their removal and the capability of the Afghan army and police force to keep the country secure once coalition troops have left. Defence officials said the deaths would have no effect on strategy or tactics deployed by British troops. If anything, it would encourage military commanders to stay the course, they said. However, officials indicated ministers were well aware of war-weariness among the public. An investigation is under way to find out what caused the explosion that wrecked the Warrior vehicle as it patrolled the border of Helmand and Kandahar in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday. The force of the blast led to early speculation that the vehicle was hit by an old mine, possibly from the Soviet era, but an initial examination of the Warrior suggested it was probably a large Taliban roadside bomb. The extraction of the bodies was hampered by bad weather, defence officials said. David Cameron described the loss of the men as a \"desperately sad day for our country\". He said it was a \"reminder of the huge price that we are paying for the work we are doing in Afghanistan and the sacrifice that our troops have made and continue to make\". But the prime minister pointed out that the men were carrying out important work to prevent Afghanistan becoming a haven for al-Qaida to plan attacks on the UK or its allies. Downing Street said last month that British troops would end their lead combat role in Afghanistan by the end of next year. This will lead to Afghan security forces being in sole charge of combat operations against insurgents by the end of 2014, when most of Britain's 9,500-strong contingent will have returned home. The timeframe may well be shortened at the Nato summit in Chicago in May. However, Nato commanders in Afghanistan have told Downing Street and the White House that they want to keep levels of the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) as high as possible between now and the end of the \"fighting season\" next year \u2013 September 2013. They insist this is the best way of ensuring the country does not descend into chaos before the final withdrawal of combat troops. If Cameron agrees to Nato's proposal, about 9,000 UK troops will remain in Helmand until autumn next year. They would be under more pressure too. Sixteen thousand US Marines are withdrawing from Helmand within months, and although Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, has said Britain will not \"backfill\", Afghan forces are unlikely to be able to shoulder the burden of security alone. Privately, commanders also warn that the Isaf coalition could disintegrate if either country signals an early exit. \"That is the biggest danger for Afghanistan,\" said one. \"A hasty and chaotic exit must be avoided.\" But political pressure is mounting on both sides of the Atlantic to accelerate the drawdown. The loss of the British soldiers this week is bound to raise questions about their resources. Cameron accepted there was a need to make sure personnel had all the equipment they needed to keep them \"as safe as possible\". But the MoD was quick to quash suggestions that the vulnerability of the Warrior could be blamed for the deaths. The Warrior vehicle has been upgraded throughout its service in Iraq and Afghanistan to try to combat the threat from roadside bombs and mines. A \u00a31bn upgrade was announced at the end of last year to extend its life to 2040 and beyond but the MoD stressed this was not in response to \"any identified deficiencies\" in its armour. A spokesman said: \"Warrior provides some of the highest levels of protection available but sadly no armoured vehicle can provide absolute protection from the very largest explosions.\" Writing in the Times the chief of the defence staff, General Sir David Richards, said the progress made since entering the country in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks was \"truly impressive\" and vowed to continue the strategy and tactics employed by British troops. \"As progress continues the work of our servicemen and women will draw down but our efforts will endure,\" he said. \"Sadly as we hold that course it is likely that others will lose loved ones.\" Richards added that he and his troops did not underestimate the dangers faced in Afghanistan, but understood \"the importance of the mission with which we are charged\". \"We will hold our nerve,\" he added. The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, claimed morale in Afghanistan remained \"extremely high\" because soldiers knew they had an important job to do. He said: \"The people on the ground are acutely conscious of the risks that they are running but they are also incredibly proud of the job that they are doing and rightly so, and hugely satisfied by the level of public support that they have back home.\" The former foreign secretary David Miliband warned that there was no \"political strategy\" in Afghanistan to secure the peace after British military operations came to an end. \"The absolute key is that at the moment we have extraordinary bravery, as well as sacrifice, intelligence and skill, from British service people and that is tactically making advances, but what is missing is a clear strategy,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"That is absolutely key to the last two years of British combat operations. By strategy I mean a plan to make sure there is a sustainable peace in Afghanistan after our time there in military operations.\" He added: \"We know that, in the end, there needs to be a political solution in Afghanistan \u2013 all the tribes in, all the neighbours onside and al-Qaida kept out. It's the absence of that political strategy that is brought into stark relief by the terrible news yesterday.\"",

By strategy I mean a plan to make sure there is a sustainable peace in Afghanistan after our time there in military operations.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We know that, in the end, there needs to be a political solution in Afghanistan \u2013 all the tribes in, all the neighbours onside and al-Qaida kept out. It's the absence of that political strategy that is brought into stark relief by the terrible news yesterday.\"</p>",

Airbus's parent, the European aerospace and defence group EADS, revealed the cost at its annual results in Paris on Thursday morning, a month after safety checks for the state-of-the-art aircraft were extended to all 67 in service. The European Aviation Safety Agency has warned that if they are not detected the cracks inside the wings \"may lead to reduction of the structural integrity of the aeroplane\". The EASA directives apply to two types of crack. The most serious defect, located in a specific area of the A380 wings, relates to brackets that attach the A380's wing ribs \u2013 the elongated, oval-shaped frames that run along the width of the wing \u2013 to the wing's metal skin. The cracks were caused by the stress generated when the brackets were fastened to the skin \u2013 a strain that was exacerbated by the flexing of the wings during flight. A380 wings are built at the Airbus factory in Broughton, Wales, but it is understood that the most serious cracks are a design fault. The main Airbus wing design facility is at Filton near Bristol although the brackets at the centre of the safety scare were not made there. So far 18 planes have been checked for the most serious defect, dubbed a \"type two\" crack, and every plane must be checked before it reaches 1,300 flights in service. Aviation sources said that type two cracks had not been discovered in every inspection to date, although they had been found in some checks. The A380's biggest customer is Dubai-based airline Emirates, which operates 20 of the 525-seater jets, followed by Singapore Airlines with 15, Qantas with 12, Lufthansa eight, Air France six, Korean Air five and China Southern two. The repair bill includes covering the cost of the checks and, if necessary, replacing cracked parts with new fittings. If serious cracks are detected, the flawed part is cut out and replaced by engineers. EADS revealed on Thursday that 2011 sales rose 7% to \u20ac49.1bn from \u20ac45.7bn the year before, beating analysts' expectations of around \u20ac47.9bn. Full-year profit at the group, where Airbus is the biggest unit, grew 87% to just over \u20ac1bn. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2012. The original referred to a compensation bill instead of a repair bill. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "7pm Kauto Star update: decision set for Monday A decision on Kauto Star's participation in the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup will be made on Monday, said his owner Clive Smith. The racing world has been waiting with bated breath all week as the daily updates have arrived from trainer Paul Nicholls regarding the legendary chaser's progress following a schooling fall. Noises emanating from Nicholls' Ditcheat base have been far more positive inside the last 48 hours and Smith believes the 12-year-old is \"nearly there\". The dual Gold Cup and five-time King George winner will gallop alongside stablemate Mon Parrain after racing at Wincanton on Friday, when lucky racegoers will get the chance to see for themselves how he is progressing. \"I'll be going to Wincanton to see him,\" said Smith. \"He's coming along nicely now and is almost back to normal. We're nearly there, I think. \"The decision on whether he runs or not will be made on Monday, not Friday. \"Paul has said he will school him on the grass gallops at home, as he has done every year before Cheltenham, and after he's done that the decision will be announced.\" Nicholls later reported in his Betfair column that Kauto Star once again came through his daily exercise unscathed. \"Kauto Star enjoyed his usual morning preparation before having two canters up the hill with Big Buck's and he continues to please us and head in the right direction,\" said Nicholls. \"So we look forward to his racecourse gallop at Wincanton tomorrow. We have had a very busy morning here today, schooling on the grass. \"Zarkandar went with Pearl Swan, and both looked particularly sharp. Brampour schooled with Prospect Wells, and Ulck Du Lin worked with Sonofvic.\" PA 5.45pm Rumours wrong about Ted not being up for the Cup Will Hayler: Following Twitter gossip too closely could have proved expensive for some punters on Wednesday night when Ted Spread was rumoured to be missing the Imperial Cup. Bloodstock agent Anthony Bromley, a close associate and friend of Paul Nicholls, told a Cheltenham Festival preview night in Dublin that Ted Spread would miss the Imperial Cup and be kept back for next week's County Hurdle. Cue Ted Spread drifting (slightly) on Betfair and money arriving for his stablemate. So what happened at Thursday's final declaration stage? Well, Ted Spread runs, of course. And Hinterland doesn't, despite the rumour on the street. Nor does Hinterland run in the Fred Winter next week, as he was incidentally taken out of that race as well on Thursday. Perhaps a switch to the Supreme Novice Hurdle is on the cards for Hinterland? There's no doubt which horse is the best backed for the Imperial Cup. Master Of The Arts, 4-1 second-favourite with sponsors Paddy Power, bids to continue a fine Pipe family tradition in the race, having been 10-1 when betting opened at the start of the week. A bonus of \u00a375,000 is on offer to the connections of any horse who wins the Imperial Cup and goes on to claim victory at the Festival, a feat only achieved by Martin and David Pipe, most recently in 2007 when Gaspara, trained by Pipe junior, took the Imperial Cup and the Fred Winter Hurdle. \"Master Of Arts is working well and has schooled well at home. It would appear that it will be better ground at Sandown on Saturday and that should suit and we are looking for a big run,\" said the trainer on Wednesday. \"I am hoping to do the Paddy Power Imperial Cup-County Hurdle double and I always like to have a bit of Paddy's money. He's had his problems but is now working well and everything like the trip is okay. The money tells the story and he's been well backed.\" 2.40pm French imports could have major advantage at Cheltenham Will Hayler: The lenient treatment of exported French jumpers in British handicaps has become increasingly clear to me this season and I've written about it here in The Betting Week column. You might have examples of your own to add. Every day brings bad news for punters at present and Thursday's unlucky losers are those who have backed Invictus for the RSA Chase. While offering a positive bulletin over Triumph Hurdle hope Grumeti, trainer Alan King revealed that \"there would have to be doubt over whether Invictus runs\" after the horse suffered an unidentified setback. Sorry if that's your life-changing accumulator kyboshed. In other Cheltenham news, the clear-cut victory of Monte Cavallo in the opener at Wincanton has given Red Inca's form a tasty boost ahead of the Fred Winter Hurdle. He's a horse right at the top of my shortlist for the race and I bet Brian Ellison can win races with him on the Flat too this summer. Boston Bob and Simonsig are the two standout names in the latest entries just released for Wednesday's Neptune Novice Hurdle, an event for which 34 horses have stood their ground. However, Willie Mullins has seemingly still not made his mind up over whether Boston Bob runs in this race over two miles and five furlongs or in the Albert Bartlett next Friday over three miles. Mullins also has a number of other possibles still engaged, including Felix Yonger, Make Your Mark, Marasonnien, Simenon and Sous Les Cieux. Thursday's best bets, by Will Hayler Following a decent start to the season, winners have dried up for Sue and Harvey Smith in recent months but I could see the lightly raced Belmore Baron (2.10) giving them some cheer at Carlisle on Thursday. To have managed just six racecourse appearances as a 10-year-old tells a story of an injury-ravaged career but there was plenty of promise to be taken from his latest effort when fifth in a big field at Market Rasen having made steady progress from the rear division on his first outing for over a year. An inexperienced conditional was on board that day, but although this is also a contest restricted to riders learning the ropes, it is the impressive Jonathan England \u2013 younger brother of established rider David \u2013 who is on board. Belmore Baron isn't the sort of horse to rely upon. He's tried to refuse in the past and jumping problems haven't helped his fragile disposition, but there are signs of hope contained in his record and the patience of his trainer could just be finally rewarded. Cassius (4.50) ran with a great deal more promise than his finishing position suggests last time (faded quickly close home) and is worth a chance dropped to the minimum trip, while Mr Woods (4.20) simply remains too well treated for me to take him on, despite an abject effort last time when I was feeling tremendously clever for backing him at 16-1 against a 5-1 starting price only for him to produce another lifeless performance. He's down a further 9lb and in the easiest race of his life now. Grandioso (3.00) was always particularly highly regarded by former trainer Howard Johnson, but hasn't performed in two starts for Paul Nicholls. He may be worth another chance now tried in handicap company at the champion's local track, Wincanton, particularly as his latest poor showing came when Nicholls' team were under the weather with the effects of a virus. Things are going better now. Joe Tizzard has a point to prove with Old Tricks (5.10) having produced by far his two worst efforts on the occasions he has been in the saddle. However, Tizzard really should be able to set the record straight here at Wincanton, with a repeat of the horse's latest performance over course and distance last month likely to prove good enough to see him break his duck over hurdles. He is a thorough stayer over this two-mile trip and will benefit from a fairly positive ride which brings his stamina into play. Stat of the day, by Paul Jones Saturday's Paddy Power Imperial Cup at Sandown is, of course, a valuable and prestigious race in its own right but the \u00a375,000 bonus put on offer should the winner go on to win any race at the Cheltenham Festival has created an extra dimension over the best part of the last couple of decades. Martin Pipe managed this feat on two occasions with Olympian in 1993 and Blowing Wind five years later and both then went on to justify favouritism in the Coral Cup and Vincent O'Brien County Hurdle respectively. Pond House may have a new master but the thinking remains pretty much the same and David Pipe followed in his father's footsteps when Gaspara also netted the big bonus by following up her success in the Imperial Cup by making all the running to win the Fred Winter NoviceHandicap Hurdle. Five horses have won at the Cheltenham Festival having won the Paddy Power Imperial Cup since 1985 with Floyd and Moody Man also successful in 1985 and 1990 but Travel Mystery (Martin Pipe again) and Carlito Brigante (Paul Webber) also went mighty close finishing second at Cheltenham. Paul Jones is author of the Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Guide Tipping competition, day four Kenty58 went back to the lead with a double yesterday, picking out Salut Honore (13-2) and Royal Entourage (11-8), a double also achieved by BearRides, Rivercity and Joehow. Stee33 and sandiuk paired Royal Entourage with Killfinan Castle (6-1), while suckzinclee and spiller had the two bigger priced winners. Kenty says he can't use the prize and suggested a raffle, which is a noble idea but not very practical, given that we have to identify a winner on Friday night in order to get the tickets to them in time. We would normally pass the tickets down to the runner-up. Kenty, would this be all right with you? To that end, perhaps those in contention but who can't use the tickets could say so now. Apologies if you have already said so - we've had a lot on our minds. Today, we'd like your tips, please, for these races: 4.05 Wincanton, 4.50 Carlisle, 5.40 Wolverhampton. This week's prize is two Club enclosure tickets to day one of the Cheltenham Festival, next Tuesday 13th March, kindly offered by OLBG, a sports betting community website, who are sponsoring a race at the Festival for the first time. You will have to be able to provide us with your postal address on Friday evening (in response to our email) and the tickets will be sent so as to arrive on Monday morning. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not entered so far this week, you are welcome to do so today but you will start on -9. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.

This had been achieved by embedding social value objectives \u2013 in this case, relating to social capital \u2013 into a commissioning process for adult care services. As a commissioning process it ticked many good-practice boxes, but I was particularly interested in how they had gone about applying the concept of social value in practice and the circumstances that led to this situation. This approach recognised that third-sector organisations in the area did more than deliver services \u2013 they contributed a great deal to social capital in communities. While leadership was not the only condition that enabled this initiative to take place, I would say it was a key factor. I was told that the chief executive of East Sussex county council had been very supportive of the approach, and leadership from the very top was probably essential. I believe leadership was also demonstrated by many others involved in the process. This included the various commissioners in social care and health, the third-sector lead officer for personalisation and the local support and development organisations who supported the process and had been banging the drum about the value of the local third sector for many a year. By leadership, I don't just mean that they took the initiative in getting the process off the ground, securing the necessary buy-in and driving things forward. They also demonstrated the courage of their convictions in the face of the inevitable obstacles, cynicism and naysayers, and realised that they wouldn't be able to get it absolutely right the first time, but they were going to go ahead and give it their best shot anyway. Neither was this a small project to test out a new approach \u2013 it was an important multimillion-pound commissioning process. There is nowhere to hide with an initiative like this. We need more of this kind of courage in public and third-sector leaders. Too often in my work on commissioning and procurement, I hear stories about public sector approaches and practices that are unduly risk-averse or seem based on an attitude of \"we can't do x because ... \". The list of endings to this phrase is as long as your imagination, but often includes \"European regulations\". I'm not suggesting for one second that public bodies act unlawfully, but it takes good leadership to go beyond safe and simple legal compliance, act on the courage of convictions and take bold new steps into relatively unknown territory. This is the kind of leadership that will be needed now that the public services (social value) bill has gone through parliament. Giving consideration to social value in commissioning will become a legal requirement. There is no blueprint. You will have to be prepared to take calculated risks and venture into new territory, drawing the map as you go.

      "bodyText": "I vividly remember the first time I saw Google Goggles in action. I flicked to the Guardian's sudoku, pointed a friend's smartphone at the page and took a snapshot. In a matter of seconds, the screen showed a Google-generated image with the puzzle correctly completed. I stared at the image, looked my friend in the eye and whispered in unflabbergasted tones: \"Well, it figures.\" It is a moment I will forget. These moments of gob-unsmacked, wholly-plussed non-wonder at Things Computers Can Now Do But Once Couldn't are becoming more frequent as technology bounds along - almost part of everyday life. And sudoku is perhaps one of the least incongruous activities a computer might take a crack at. If you're a human solving a sudoku, you're essentially slowly working through algorithms colossally better suited to a central processing unit. It's the cognitive equivalent of deciding that machines aren't best placed to handle your email and resolving instead to hand-write a message, walk, swim and walk it across to a Palo Alto server farm, then walk, swim and walk back before placing it on the desk of your colleague and returning the six feet to your own workstation. Well done you. Crosswords, however, are a different kind of challenge: impossible without the input of a fleshy irrational human brain. Or are they? Next week, the annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament will see a new competitor: a laptop. On it is a program called Dr Fill, created by former artificial-intelligence researcher Matt Ginsberg. Dr Ginsberg, who runs algorithms for the US Air Force when he isn't setting New York Times puzzles or trying to get a MacBook Pro to solve them, has loaded his application with pre-existing crossword answers and chunks of Wikipedia and the IMDb. But he doesn't think that what Dr Fill does counts as thinking. It is, he says, a serial business of summoning likely answers and seeing whether they fit with each other. While this sounds like a description of how humans approach most quick crosswords, Dr Ginsberg says it doesn't constitute \"understanding\" of words or clues. Given that most American puzzles are more like a kind of lettered concise than a cryptic - a kind of \"slow quick\" - this suggests that however Dr Fill fares in the tournament, the cryptic crosswords will remain the preserve of us meaty solvers. Or does it? In our look at soundalike clues, we mentioned a computer at Aberdeen university which tries to construct jokes and make humans laugh. The results are sometimes poignant\u2026 What kind of an adult is a panorama? A scene-ior. \u2026even more poignant than a human doing a sudoku, but the joke-robot is on the right lines and, crucially, is trying to learn from its mis-hits through a touchingly needy feedback form that follows each gag. Also in the UK, that same drive for self-improvement is present in Crossword Maestro, software created by William Tunstall-Pedoe, who also gave the world smartphone personal assistant Evi and an anagram generator used by Dan Brown to help write his novels, though scientists cannot be held responsible for the ends to which their creations are put. Readers may know better - and the comment form is below - but Crossword Maestro is the solvingest robo-decipherer I've played with; not that it would know what \"solvingest\" or \"robo-decipherer\" mean, which gives you the edge, dear reader, over it. But where, exactly, is that edge? To find out where it - and thereby IT - falters, I approached its online interface with some easy clues and a few trickier ones. Rather than pick any actual setter as \"easy\", I used my own undistinguished efforts, which Crossword Maestro made light work of - as with this: As direction, I fancy reference books (12) 'reference books' is the definition. (dictionary is a kind of reference book) 'as direction i fancy' is the subsidiary indication. 'fancy' indicates an anagram. 'as'+'direction'+'i'='asdirectioni' 'asdirectioni' anagrammed gives 'dictionaries'. It was the same with my other clues; so far, the machines win. But I suspected that a recent Guardian clue by Paul might prove trickier: Recess that is a lot of fun (6) 'fun' is the definition. Although both the answer and definition are singular nouns, I cannot understand how one could define the other. 'recess that is a lot of' is the subsidiary indication. 'recess' becomes 'stall' (stall is a kind of recess). 'that is' becomes 'sc' ('that is'-&gt;'sc' is in my crossword knowledge base). 'a lot of' means to remove the last letter. 'sc' with its last letter removed is 's'. 'stall'+'s'='stalls' Poor robot. from watching it solve other clues, I know it knows that \"that is\" can indicate IE and it seems to have \"nook\" linked to \"recess\" in its word list. It also knows that there's a word that can be made of putting IE after NOOK, but being a frigid automaton, it has no instinct that \"a lot of fun\" works as a definition for NOOKIE, (although if it got your internet history off of Google, it might know exactly what kind of fun we're talking about on a case-by-case basis). Had the software known that Paul had written the clue and that he's at the saucy end of setting spectrum, it might have had the extra confidence to combine NOOK and IE - and the Aberdeen joke-bot could tell it why the clue is funny. What the software can't do is key to crosswording. After all, we all fail to complete some puzzles, but a computer can't enjoy the experience of solving. Or can it? Well, let's hope not. It's nice to have something that's just our little secret as humans. When we're all toiling in the coltan mines to serve our technologically superior masters, it's a comfort to know that in the allocated breaks, as we scramble for the scattered feed, we can together enjoy a cryptic puzzle without the machines knowing what's provoking our thin, weary smiles.

It also knows that there's a word that can be made of putting IE after NOOK, but being a frigid automaton, it has no instinct that \"a lot of fun\" works as a definition for NOOKIE, (although <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/03/internet-privacy\">if it got your internet history off of Google</a>, it might know exactly what kind of fun we're talking about on a case-by-case basis).</p> <p>Had the software known that Paul had written the clue and that he's at the saucy end of setting spectrum, it might have had the extra confidence to combine NOOK and IE - and the Aberdeen joke-bot could tell it why the clue is funny. What the software can't do is key to crosswording. After all, we all fail to complete some puzzles, but a computer can't enjoy the experience of solving. Or can it?</p> <p>Well, let's hope not. It's nice to have something that's just our little secret as humans. When we're all toiling in the coltan mines to serve our technologically superior masters, it's a comfort to know that in the allocated breaks, as we scramble for the scattered feed, we can together enjoy a cryptic puzzle without the machines knowing what's provoking our thin, weary smiles.

      "bodyText": "This is a story about our co-operation on the banking blog. So far we've chalked up more than 900,000 page views, 2,500 comments, thousands of tweets and Facebook likes, and by coming forward and volunteering you've brought about most of the 40-plus interviews. Thank you for all that, oh people formerly known as the audience! In the old days of paper journalism our relationship was a one-way street. Journalist consults sources and writes article, audience reads it and the next day it's chip wrapper. That was only 20 years ago. Now there's the web and the long tail, and we can begin exploring what this might let us do. Let me take you through this blog's first five months, and use this to talk about how a co-operative model of journalism might work. It seems that rather than firing off individual stories at an unseen and mute audience, journalists can now be intermediaries and moderators, hosting a running conversation between readers as sources on the one hand, and readers as electorate on the other. That was a long sentence. By the \"readers as sources\" I mean those who know more about finance than I ever will. These insider readers might volunteer for an interview, contribute an opinion, tip or observation via email, or leave a comment in the thread. The \"readers as electorate\" are those who know as much as or less about finance as I do. These outsiders \"vote\" with their page views, tweets and likes, and can leave comments on what they found useful and what they would like to know more about. It's early days but here are a few examples of how this worked on the blog. The first 10 Voices of Finance went online on 15 September \u2013 and the interviewees were all men. Immediately, a dozen women working in finance volunteered for an interview to set this right. This led to a piece on what it's like for them as female financial professionals, which became the best read on the entire blog. This was clearly of interest to outsiders. In the interviews the women were unanimous that in their experience blatant sexism was a thing of the past. But then a woman working in insurance came forward, alleging widespread sexism in her area of finance. After her interview went up, a poster by the name of Princesschipchops commented that she had also worked in insurance, and gave the following description: \"I think the big problem was the amounts of booze involved in most things. It fuels the sexism of course but it's not only sexism it fuels, I remember fights and all sorts of stuff that went on.\" She continued, saying she had \"\u2026 witnessed all sorts of things. Seriously, much worse than I saw in other jobs and industries (and I'd been a cocktail waitress, bar worked, danced in nightclubs! You'd think I'd witness more there but no).\" Princesschipchops added that she had retrained as a teacher. Readers who are insiders taking ownership of, or responsibility for, the conversation has been one of the most interesting and encouraging outcomes of this experimental blog so far. Sometimes this works in a quite straightforward way, such as when I get something wrong, for instance muddling up quantitative easing and the Bank of England base rate. Other times people will write in the way of the insurance broker, offering an opposing view to something expressed in an interview. Or they will volunteer for an interview after noticing the blog did not have anyone yet from their area, for instance project finance; restructuring; or risk analysis for a retail bank. One outcome of this process is breadth. You cannot read the interviews on this blog without realising just how huge and hugely diverse the financial sector is. Slowly a mosaic is taking shape where no single piece is representative, yet an overall picture emerges. As the mosaic fills up there will be more depth, for example, when a second interviewee builds on the views expressed by the first one. This already happened with one recruiter who was immediately criticised in the comments as working for a dodgy firm on the fringe. Within a few hours a second recruiter got in touch \"to give you a different perspective from a more established player in the industry\". And so on. Obviously the comment thread is a great place for in- and outsiders to expand on any given blogpost. The Voices of Finance interviews feature bankers in their own words. That is inevitably one-sided as people are rarely self-critical. The comment section provides a strong, albeit sometimes uncouth, counterpoint. Sometimes it feels like a bar where people go to talk about the film they've just seen. That's fine, but wouldn't it be great for the comment thread to be the place where that film's sequel is made? That won't be easy. People in finance can get fired for talking to the press and there are other good reasons for allowing people to post anonymously. At the same time this presents a project like this with some difficulties. Take this comment by BenCaute: \"\u2026 banks have such fiendishly complex systems manned by people incentivised to screw every last penny out anything that moves that we must understand banks as being in a constant state of multiparty civil war \u2013 the people at the top have no clue what is going on\". Coming from an experienced insider this would be hugely interesting and relevant. But if this was written by a complete outsider, much less so. The problem with not knowing whether the poster has expert knowledge or not is less pressing when he or she posts a question, rather than an answer. The computer programmer for a high frequency trading hedge fund was only too happy to answer some truly vituperative comments, and gave a fascinating insight into the social darwinism of his world. I find this kind of shuttling between readers and sources great fun, though it's always better when the responses are relatively measured. It's striking how much less trolling and ranting there is on Twitter and in the emails I receive. In fact, some of the most valuable observations have come in via email, in particular on why there are so few whistleblowers in finance. More on that soon. It's always possible to corroborate comments via Twitter, which can lead to further contacts and avenues of exploration. When the IT consultant asserted that often banks' computer systems were a mess, I put this to @Jlbankingblog and @jorisluyendijk. About a dozen IT workers responded, saying this chimed with their experiences. That in turn fitted in with comments like this one by LinksFahren: \"I did three years' freelance work around the turn of the century building a series of screen programs for one of the big European banks in the City, earned no small sum of money doing so and was given a full-time position on the back of making such a good job of it. It was only afterwards that I found the software which had been part of their system since installation and which near as damn did everything I'd just coded for them. I never breathed a word for as long as I worked there. Why bother? It would only have upset people.\" Before turning to the quantitative side of our m\u00e9nage a beaucoup, let me encourage you to leave your own comments in the meta-comment thread below. On to the numbers then. This can be great stuff to play around with, for instance when you load all 2,500 comments into one file to run analysis on them. It seems encouraging that posters used more than three times as many question marks than exclamation marks. The word \"happy\" occurred 67 times against \"angry\" 41 times. The word cloud doesn't tell you a lot, but it's fun to play around with the word tree. You can enter any word into the little box on the left and it will show you all sentences containing that term. There's also the word net showing which words typically appear next to one another. You can play around with different connecting terms yourself, and if you want to mash up the comments, they are here for the taking. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

How do you want to see the sector change in the next five years? More focused on its patients and less on provider interests. Also, more use of the phone and the web to improve quality for patients and productivity, like any other normal industry sector. What has been your proudest achievement at work? Driving the changes that mostly got rid of waits for care over 18 weeks in the NHS in England, which existed prior to 2008. Also, leading NHS Direct through the swine flu pandemic in my first six months as chief executive. What is the most difficult thing you've had to deal with at work? People outside my organisation who are cynical. Powerful but unaccountable. Finish these sentences: I think the health bill is ... going to be all right in the end, and if it's not all right, it's not the end. The people I work with are ... great. Honest, fearless, and with the necessary staying power. I do what I do because ... what the NHS does helps make this country a more civilised place to live. Sometimes people think that I ... am a dog with a bone and need to calm down. Right now I want to ... help make changes to the NHS 111 programme so patients get a great service and it helps the NHS handle increasing demand. At work I am always learning that ... I need to take more notice of other people's great ideas. If I could go back 10 years and meet my former self I'd tell them ... to act as if anything can be changed if you try hard enough. What is the best part of your job? Spending time with staff and hearing their fresh perspective. What is the worst part of your job? Watching when we get it wrong \u2013 it can happen to any organisation \u2013 but we always learn from it and we are a better for it. What makes you smile? The view from the top of Corton Denham beacon and a pint in the Digby Tap on a Friday night. What keeps you awake at night? Almost anything can, but nothing that still worries me in the morning.

In exchange, the customer gets a portion of the product as a token of our thanks. One day a young man called Dan turned up offering to catch us fish for the restaurant. He was young and enthusiastic, so we took him up on his offer, not really expecting to see him often. However, that same weekend he turned up with 10 fat rainbow trout, four brown trout and a bucket of live crayfish. And so began a need to find new and interesting ways of using trout. This recipe started life as a salmon dish, but works just as well with Dan's fantastic fresh brown trout. Serves four. 4 portions of salmon fillet, or 2 large brown trout, filleted and pinboned 50g sea salt 200g large-leafed loose tea 200g plain rice 4 very fresh free-range eggs Rock salt For the samphire: 100g unsalted butter 2 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced very thin 500g samphire For the brown butter sauce: 200g unsalted butter 50g tiny capers The juice of \u00bc lemon Rub the flesh of the fish with the sea salt, leave to cure for 15 minutes, then wash off the salt. Line an old roasting pan that you are not very fond of with tin foil, then sprinkle in the tea and rice. Place a cake rack in the pan and put the fish skin-side down on top. Put the pan on the stove and heat until smoking. Cover the whole pan with tinfoil, cook for two minutes, then remove from heat and set aside to cool. Remove the foil cover and inspect the fish \u2013 it should still be quite raw, but smell lightly smoky. Refrigerate until needed. For the brown butter sauce, melt 200g of butter in a saucepan, add the capers and cook until they become crisp and the butter begins to brown. Add the lemon juice and keep warm. For the samphire, melt 100g butter in a frying pan, add the garlic and fry until crispy. Bring a large pan of water to a boil, plunge in the samphire for just a few seconds, drain immediately and add to the garlic pan. Toss in the pan and serve. For the eggs, bring a small pan of water to a boil, create a vortex in the centre of the water by stirring rapidly with a large spoon and crack in the eggs one at a time as it continues to spin. Simmer for one to two minutes, depending on how runny you like your eggs (we are fortunate to have freshly laid eggs daily. Failing that, if you refrigerate your eggs a day in advance, they will hold their shape much better in the water.) To cook the trout, place the smoked fillets on a baking tray lined with nonstick paper and bake at 180C for six to eight minutes, until medium rare to medium. To serve, arrange a pile of samphire in the middle of a large white plate, top with a fish fillet and a poached egg and spoon over the sauce.

      "bodyText": "Channel 4 has given the green light to a new TV channel, to be called 4seven, that will allow viewers to catch repeats of its most popular shows from this summer. The new channel, which has been developed under the code name Project Shuffle, will allow viewers who missed the first live broadcast of Channel 4's most popular shows the opportunity to catch up with them over the next seven nights. Channel 4 has secured a Freeview slot and distribution deals with Sky and Virgin Media, which had initially been wary of giving the channel the green light as it could provide competition to its own catch up services. No details on where 4seven will appear on electronic programming guides is currently being revealed by Channel 4. The launch date for the new channel has not yet been confirmed. Channel 4 initially indicated to media agencies that it would like to have it running by 1 June, but it is now thought it will launch later in the summer. Channel 4 is still in discussions with production companies to secure rights for shows to appear on the service. David Abraham, the chief executive of Channel 4, revealed the thinking behind the 4seven as a bridge between the traditional way TV is watched and a truly converged digital experience when viewers will no longer be constrained by the linear schedule. \"With so much choice out there, viewers are increasingly saying they sometimes just miss the best stuff, despite their PVR and VOD,\" said Abraham, speaking at the FT Digital Media conference in London on Thursday. \"4seven will give viewers more chances to catch the most popular and talked about Channel 4 shows from the last seven days.\" He added: \"It will schedule the main channel content that is creating noise \u2013 amongst social media, bloggers, commentators and of course via contact our viewers have directly with us \u2013 and incorporate this buzz into the look and feel of the channel.\" The proposed channel will significantly help the broadcaster by offering more advertising inventory around popular shows to shore up the flagship Channel 4 network's audience share. According to media buying agency sources, in 2011 the main Channel 4 network was down 9.6% year on year on commercial impacts among 16- to 34-year-olds \u2013 the demographic the broadcaster has built its reputation on and charges advertisers a premium to reach. Channel 4 is forecasting that if the new channel gets the go ahead it will boost commercial impacts by about 7% to 10%, or around half a percentage point of its overall share of commercial impacts. Commercial impacts are the key currency by which an airtime sales team negotiates ad deals with media buying agencies on behalf of advertisers.",

      "bodyText": "Today's extract from The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial* is taken from the opening chapter written by Huw L. Hopkins, who is studying for an MA in global journalism at Coventry university Hopkins's contribution is a scene-setter, and I make no apology for reminding everyone of the history of this affair through his straightforward diary of events. He contends, naturally enough, that The Guardian's revelation on 4 July last year, about the interception of Milly Dowler's voicemails, was the tipping point. But he takes the story back to what he argues was \"the start of the scandal\" in 2000 when Rebekah Wade (later Brooks) became editor of News of the World in succession to Phil Hall. Two years later, on 21 March 2002, 13-year-old Milly Dowler disappears. During the police hunt, exclusive stories about the case appear in the NoW before her body is finally discovered on 18 September. In July 2003, Brooks is appointed editor of The Sun and Andy Coulson replaces her at the NoW. Hopkins writes: \"They sat together at a select committee shortly after the swap [on 11 March 2003] and Brooks stated boldly, 'We have paid the police for information in the past.' Coulson interjected quickly, assuring the world that it was 'within the confines of the law'. There was little follow-up by both the press and police.\" Hopkins picks up the story two years later when the NoW's royal editor, Clive Goodman, writes stories about Prince William. He observes sarcastically that Goodman \"became the best investigative reporter the world had ever seen... But the truth is Goodman used underhand and illegal methods to discover a knee injury to the future king.\" Goodman is arrested along with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire the following year and in January 2007 they are sentenced to jail for four months and six months respectively. And Coulson resigns from the paper. In rapid succession, Rupert Murdoch's \"rigorous internal investigation\" reports - through News International chief Les Hinton - that hacking had been confined to a \"rogue reporter.\" The Press Complaints Commission finds nothing amiss. In July 2007, Coulson is appointed as the Tory party's director of communications by its leader David Cameron. In December 2007, James Murdoch assumes \"direct responsibility\" for News Corp's European and Asian operation including News International, basing himself at its Wapping offices. In April 2008, News International pays \u00a3700,000, in damages and costs, to Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association. There is no publicity because he signed a confidentiality clause and Murdoch's company didn't mention it In June 2009, it is announced that Brooks will leave The Sun to become chief executive of News International (formally taking the post in September 2009). In July 2009, The Guardian's Nick Davies reveals the Gordon Taylor settlement in a report that also alleges that the News of the World was responsible for the hacking of more than 3,000 phones. The Commons media select committee holds hearings into the allegations. The PCC announces a new investigation. The Metropolitan police, after an inquiry of no more than a day, announces it has no evidence to support The Guardian's story. The PCC follows suit in November 2009, but the Commons committee's report, released in February 2010, states that it was \"inconceivable that Goodman acted alone\". In May, the Conservative party forms a government in coalition with the Lib-Dems and Coulson goes into No 10. On 1 September 2010, the New York Times publishes the results of a lengthy investigation into phone hacking in which one former reporter is quoted as saying the practice was \"encouraged.\" On 5 January 2011, the News of the World's news editor is suspended over hacking allegations. Two weeks later, under pressure from continuing reports in The Guardian about hacking, Coulson resigns from his Downing Street post. On January 26, the Met police announce the setting up of Operation Weeting, a fresh investigation into the hacking scandal. In April, three News of the World journalists are arrested. News International sets up a compensation scheme for hacking victims, most of whose identities have been revealed in past months by The Guardian. On 4 July 2011, The Guardian publishes its Milly Dowler story. In succeeding days, the paper reveals the hacking of relatives of London 7/7 bombings, the families of the murdered Soham schoolgirls and the parents of Madeleine McCann. What follows is the most remarkable week in the history of the British media. The News of the World is closed, the prime minister announces a judicial inquiry into press standards, Murdoch's News Corporation withdraws its bid to assumes total ownership of BSkyB, Brooks resigns, as does her predecessor, Hinton. Then Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan police commissioner, resigns, as does one of his assistants, John Yates. On 19 July, Rupert Murdoch appears before the Commons select committee and says it is the most humbling day of his life. But he and his son, James, say they knew nothing of hacking. Days later, the News of the World's last editor, Colin Myler and its legal manager, Tom Crone, contest James Murdoch's testimony, saying they had told him about the hacking in an email. On 30 July, Baroness Buscombe, chair of the PCC, resigns. Hopkins continues the diary through events up to and including the early Leveson inquiry hearings.

      "body": "<p><em>Today's extract from <strong>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</strong>* is taken from the opening chapter written by <strong>Huw L. Hopkins</strong>, who is studying for an MA in global journalism at Coventry university</em> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387069238\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/8/1331199175939/Hacking.book.jpg\" alt=\"hacky\" width=\"201\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Hopkins's contribution is a scene-setter, and I make no apology for reminding everyone of the history of this affair through his straightforward diary of events.</p> <p>He contends, naturally enough, that The Guardian's revelation on 4 July last year, about the interception of Milly Dowler's voicemails, was the tipping point.</p> <p>But he takes the story back to what he argues was \"the start of the scandal\" in 2000 when Rebekah Wade (later Brooks) became editor of News of the World in succession to Phil Hall.</p> <p>Two years later, on 21 March 2002, 13-year-old Milly Dowler disappears. During the police hunt, exclusive stories about the case appear in the NoW before her body is finally discovered on 18 September. </p> <p>In July 2003, Brooks is appointed editor of The Sun and Andy Coulson replaces her at the NoW. Hopkins writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"They sat together at a select committee shortly after the swap [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/mar/12/sun.pressandpublishing\">on 11 March 2003</a>] and Brooks stated boldly, 'We have paid the police for information in the past.' Coulson interjected quickly, assuring the world that it was 'within the confines of the law'. There was little follow-up by both the press and police.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hopkins picks up the story two years later when the NoW's royal editor, Clive Goodman, writes stories about Prince William.</p> <p>He observes sarcastically that Goodman \"became the best investigative reporter the world had ever seen... But the truth is Goodman used underhand and illegal methods to discover a knee injury to the future king.\"</p> <p>Goodman is arrested along with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire the following year and in January 2007 they are sentenced to jail for four months and six months respectively. And Coulson resigns from the paper.</p> <p>In rapid succession, Rupert Murdoch's \"rigorous internal investigation\" reports - through News International chief Les Hinton - that hacking had been confined to a \"rogue reporter.\" The Press Complaints Commission finds nothing amiss. In July 2007, Coulson is appointed as the Tory party's director of communications by its leader David Cameron.</p> <p>In December 2007, James Murdoch assumes \"direct responsibility\" for News Corp's European and Asian operation including News International, basing himself at its Wapping offices. </p> <p>In April 2008, News International pays \u00a3700,000, in damages and costs, to Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association. There is no publicity because he signed a confidentiality clause and Murdoch's company didn't mention it</p> <p>In June 2009, it is announced that Brooks will leave The Sun to become chief executive of News International (formally taking the post in September 2009).</p> <p>In July 2009, The Guardian's Nick Davies reveals the Gordon Taylor settlement in a report that also alleges that the News of the World was responsible for the hacking of more than 3,000 phones.</p> <p>The Commons media select committee holds hearings into the allegations. The PCC announces a new investigation. The Metropolitan police, after an inquiry of no more than a day, announces it has no evidence to support The Guardian's story.</p> <p>The PCC follows suit in November 2009, but the Commons committee's report, released in February 2010, states that it was \"inconceivable that Goodman acted alone\". </p> <p>In May, the Conservative party forms a government in coalition with the Lib-Dems and Coulson goes into No 10. </p> <p>On 1 September 2010, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05hacking-t.html\"> the New York Times publishes the results of a lengthy investigation</a> into phone hacking in which one former reporter is quoted as saying the practice was \"encouraged.\" </p> <p>On 5 January 2011, the News of the World's news editor is suspended over hacking allegations. Two weeks later, under pressure from continuing reports in The Guardian about hacking, Coulson resigns from his Downing Street post. </p> <p>On January 26, the Met police announce the setting up of Operation Weeting, a fresh investigation into the hacking scandal.</p> <p>In April, three News of the World journalists are arrested. News International sets up a compensation scheme for hacking victims, most of whose identities have been revealed in past months by The Guardian.</p> <p>On 4 July 2011, The Guardian publishes its Milly Dowler story. In succeeding days, the paper reveals the hacking of relatives of London 7/7 bombings, the families of the murdered Soham schoolgirls and the parents of Madeleine McCann.</p> <p>What follows is the most remarkable week in the history of the British media. The News of the World is closed, the prime minister announces a judicial inquiry into press standards, Murdoch's News Corporation withdraws its bid to assumes total ownership of BSkyB, Brooks resigns, as does her predecessor, Hinton.</p> <p>Then Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan police commissioner, resigns, as does one of his assistants, John Yates.</p> <p>On 19 July, Rupert Murdoch appears before the Commons select committee and says it is the most humbling day of his life. But he and his son, James, say they knew nothing of hacking.</p> <p>Days later, the News of the World's last editor, Colin Myler and its legal manager, Tom Crone, contest James Murdoch's testimony, saying they had told him about the hacking in an email. On 30 July, Baroness Buscombe, chair of the PCC, resigns.</p> <p>Hopkins continues the diary through events up to and including the early Leveson inquiry hearings. But the value of his chapter is in showing just how long it took for the truth to emerge and the extraordinary ramifications once The Guardian's stories were proved correct.</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> <strong>Richard Peppiatt</strong> tackles the difference between a journalism based on story-telling and one based on truth-telling</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis</p>",

      "bodyText": "Paul Graham has been named as the winner of the 2012 Hasselblad award, which is presented annually to \"a photographer recognised for major achievements\". It is the first time a British photographer has won the prestigious international prize. Previous recipients include Robert Adams (2009), Nan Goldin (2007) and William Eggleston (1998). Graham, who had a major retrospective at the Whitechapel Gallery in London last year, is a self-taught photographer. He was born in Buckinghamshire and discovered photography through the books of great American pioneers like Robert Frank, Walker Evans and Paul Strand. He has lived in New York since the early 1990s. Graham first garnered critical acclaim with his early documentary work, including A1 \u2013 The Great North Road (1983) , a series shot in colour along the British motorway, and Beyond Caring (1985), which was shot in unemployment offices. Back then, Graham was a pioneer of colour in Britain, his work influencing subsequent generations of young photographers. Belonging to what was arguably the last great generation of British documentary photographers in the 1980s, Graham was the most forward-thinking and self-questioning. His work soon took on a more elliptical style and way of seeing, often challenging the received notions of what constitutes documentary photography. Perhaps the most dramatic example is American Night (2003), an impressionistic visual investigation of the social and racial issues of the country through the use of images that were often overexposed, in some cases, to the point of near-invisibility. In 2009, he published A Shimmer of Possibility, a 12-volume book that could be read as a series of vague short stories, each one illuminating the American everyday in often luminous images. In an interview last year, Graham told me: \"It has steadily become less important to me that the photographs are about something in the most obvious way. I am interested in more elusive and nebulous subject matter. The photography I most respect pulls something out of the ether of nothingness \u2026 you can't sum up the results in a single line. In a way, 'a shimmer of possibility' is really about these nothing moments in life.\" Graham won the Deutsche B\u00f6rse prize in 2009. He currently has a show of recent work, entitled The Present, at Pace/MacGill Gallery in New York.",

      "bodyText": "Dear friends, family and colleagues, I have a confession to make. When I say I'm late because of public transport, at least 90% of the time it's actually because I can't decide what to wear. Or what to have for breakfast. Or what book to take. Or which nail varnish will best help me achieve the goals of the day. In short, I'm rubbish at making minor decisions. And, judging by the number of companies now offering to make choices for us, I don't think I'm the only one. A curated subscription is a service that, for a monthly fee, selects products for you and delivers them to you. It's a bit like having your very own 1940s wife. Over the last year, services have cropped up to cover more and more aspects of modern life. For a monthly fee I can have Kopi or Has Bean choose my bespoke coffee blend, Stack select my independently published magazine and Weekly Indie choose my fave new unsigned band. Tea Horse will select my brew. Carmine can pick out my beauty products. Threadless can choose what T-shirt I should wear. Love Your Larder can fill my cupboards with mysterious foodie delights and Sponge can bake me a monthly surprise cake. For \u00a38,000 Net-a-porter will even send me a monthly pair of shoes for a year. And there are countless cheese clubs and bread clubs out there that really should get together and get some sort of cheese sandwich thing going. It's like someone took the vegetable box scheme idea and genetically modified it to cover all aspects of our lives. Curated subs fall into two main camps. The first aim to cure us of what Douglas Coupland called 'option paralysis' by making our choices for us. These are the vegetable boxes, the cake, T-shirt and art subscriptions. They often have an educational or avuncular tinge to them, such as the Allotinabox subscription that was created because \"people are extremely busy ... and at the garden centre the variety is overwhelming and slightly confusing.\" Every quarter they send a bespoke box of seasonal seeds and products to help even the least greenfingered get growing. Coffee subscriptions also aim to educate. I tried Has Bean's InMyMug weekly plan, where every Monday brings a bespoke blend of coffee and a YouTube video of tasting notes. I watched the clips as I drank, and felt more able to hold my own in conversation with the coffee snobberati with each sip. Hints of pineapple, you say? Chocolate? Digestive? Yes, yes and yes, I can taste them all. And to think I was raised on Nescaf\u00e9. The other type of lifestyle subscriptions stem from the belief that, as the song goes, You can't get what you want (till you know what you want). As such, they offer an ever-changing selection of samples and tasters - the idea being that when you find something you like, you go on to buy it more regularly. These include the tea sampling subs, the larder boxes, the indy magazine trials and the beauty boxes. Beauty boxes are big news right now. For around \u00a310 you receive a selection of 'deluxe size' samples, all beautifully wrapped. She Said Beauty's box comes with a website they're billing as Facebook for beauty, where you can rate products and follow people; Joliebox comes with its own beauty magazine; and Glossy Box also offers a Glossy Box for men. The beauty industry thrives on sampling. Brands want to give us samples. Consumers want to try them. But previously the only way of distributing these beauty tasters was a system called 'debasing yourself at beauty counter by begging for freebies only to leave empty-handed and convinced they had something really fabulous under the counter that they wouldn't give you because they didn't like your coat'.

      "body": "<p>Dear friends, family and colleagues, I have a confession to make. When I say I'm late because of public transport, at least 90% of the time it's actually because I can't decide what to wear. Or what to have for breakfast. Or what book to take. Or which nail varnish will best help me achieve the goals of the day. In short, I'm rubbish at making minor decisions. And, judging by the number of companies now offering to make choices for us, I don't think I'm the only one. </p> <p>A curated subscription is a service that, for a monthly fee, selects products for you and delivers them to you. It's a bit like having your very own 1940s wife. Over the last year, services have cropped up to cover more and more aspects of modern life. For a monthly fee I can have <a href=\"http://www.kopi.co.uk/\">Kopi</a> or <a href=\"http://hasbean.co.uk/\">Has Bean</a> choose my bespoke coffee blend, <a href=\"http://www.stackmagazines.com/\">Stack</a> select my independently published magazine and <a href=\"http://www.weeklyindie.com/\">Weekly Indie</a> choose my fave new unsigned band. <a href=\"http://teahorse.co.uk/\">Tea Horse</a> will select my brew. <a href=\"http://www.carmine.co.uk/\">Carmine</a> can pick out my beauty products. <a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/\">Threadless</a> can choose what T-shirt I should wear. <a href=\"http://www.loveyourlarder.com/\">Love Your Larder</a> can fill my cupboards with mysterious foodie delights and <a href=\"http://www.sponge.co.uk/\">Sponge</a> can bake me a monthly surprise cake. For \u00a38,000 <a href=\"http://www.net-a-porter.com\">Net-a-porter</a> will even send me a monthly pair of shoes for a year. And there are countless cheese clubs and bread clubs out there that really should get together and get some sort of cheese sandwich thing going. </p> <p>It's like someone took the vegetable box scheme idea and genetically modified it to cover all aspects of our lives.</p> <p>Curated subs fall into two main camps. The first aim to cure us of what Douglas Coupland called 'option paralysis' by making our choices for us. These are the vegetable boxes, the cake, T-shirt and art subscriptions. They often have an educational or avuncular tinge to them, such as the <a href=\"http://www.allotinabox.com/grow-your-own/\">Allotinabox</a> subscription that was created because \"people are extremely busy ... and at the garden centre the variety is overwhelming and slightly confusing.\" Every quarter they send a bespoke box of seasonal seeds and products to help even the least greenfingered get growing. </p> <p>Coffee subscriptions also aim to educate. I tried Has Bean's <a href=\"http://www.hasbean.co.uk/categories/Subscription-Coffee/\">InMyMug weekly plan</a>, where every Monday brings a bespoke blend of coffee and a YouTube video of tasting notes. I watched the clips as I drank, and felt more able to hold my own in conversation with the coffee snobberati with each sip. Hints of pineapple, you say? Chocolate? Digestive? Yes, yes and yes, I can taste them all. And to think I was raised on Nescaf\u00e9. </p> <p>The other type of lifestyle subscriptions stem from the belief that, as the song goes, You can't get what you want (till you know what you want). As such, they offer an ever-changing selection of samples and tasters - the idea being that when you find something you like, you go on to buy it more regularly. These include the tea sampling subs, the larder boxes, the indy magazine trials and the beauty boxes. <br> Beauty boxes are big news right now. For around \u00a310 you receive a selection of 'deluxe size' samples, all beautifully wrapped. <a href=\"https://www.shesaidbeauty.com/beauty-box\">She Said Beauty</a>'s box comes with a website they're billing as Facebook for beauty, where you can rate products and follow people; <a href=\"http://joliebox.co.uk/\">Joliebox</a> comes with its own beauty magazine; and <a href=\"http://www.glossybox.co.uk/\">Glossy Box</a> also offers a Glossy Box for men.</p> <p>The beauty industry thrives on sampling. Brands want to give us samples. Consumers want to try them. But previously the only way of distributing these beauty tasters was a system called 'debasing yourself at beauty counter by begging for freebies only to leave empty-handed and convinced they had something really fabulous under the counter that they wouldn't give you because they didn't like your coat'. For someone whose method of traversing a beauty hall is scooting round the outside avoiding eye contact in case a salesperson straightens my hair or douses me in perfume, the new system of distribution is far preferable. Plus the samples are bigger.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as I'm unaccustomed to having lots of samples, when I receive mine my monkey hoarder brain kicks in and I'm overwhelmed by an urge to hide my precious treasure (the samples) from the other monkeys (my boyfriend) at the back of the bathroom cabinet.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson says he wants to see any journalist involved in phone hacking feel \"the full consequences of the law\" after his office came under fire over the fact his deputy Kit Malthouse had complained to Scotland Yard on \"several occasions\" that it was devoting too many resources to the News of the World phone-hacking investigation. The Conservative mayor came to the defence of his head of policing and crime at a statutory question time eventin Hammersmith on Wednesday night after a member of the audience challenged Malthouse to explain why he sought to \"prevent\" the police investigation into phone-hacking allegations. The question referred to evidence submitted by the former Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Paul Stevenson to the Leveson inquiry earlier this week in which he said that Malthouse complained to Scotland Yard on \"several occasions\" that it was devoting too many resources to the News of the World phone-hacking investigation. In his written statement to the inquiry, Stephenson said: \"On several occasions after Operation Weeting had started and I had returned from sick leave, the chair of the MPA [Metropolitan Police Authority], Kit Malthouse, expressed a view that we should not be devoting this level of resources to the phone-hacking inquiry as a consequence of a largely political and media-driven 'level of hysteria',\" Stephenson wrote. Before Malthouse, who was chairing the event, could answer, Johnson told the audience that he wanted the police to do \"what they need to do\" to see through the investigation. The mayor came under fire himself last week after saying on ITV he wanted to \"knock [the investigation] on the head as fast as we can\", because it was \"tying up\" police time. Johnson, who famously dismissed the original allegations of widespread phone hacking as \"a load of codswallop cooked up by the Labour party\", told a packed room at Hammersmith town hall that he and Malthouse were determined the investigations should go on to their conclusion. \"We are determined to see this thing go on until \u2026 journalists, whatever newspaper group they belong to, if they've broken the law, and indeed if any public servants have broken the law, then they need to feel the full consequences of the law.\" Johnson controversially handed over the reins of the MPA to Malthouse, a London assembly member and his deputy mayor for policing, in early 2010. Malthouse is now the head of the mayor's office for policing and crime, which is the successor to the MPA and in effect makes him the country's first police commissioner. Malthouse, a former deputy leader of Westminster council, told the audience that he had raised his doubts because he felt \"and still feel\" that the resources could be better deployed. Prefacing his comments with the need for caution because of his appearance at the Leveson inquiry later this month, Malthouse told the audience: \"When I was chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, my job was to challenge the allocation of resources by the commissioner and that's because I wanted to make sure that he was allocating enough resources to the issues that concern Londoners like knife crime, teenage killings, rape and violence. \"At the time, the police was allocating a lot of resources to this investigation, and I needed to make sure that that was justified against all the other priorities that the commissioner had to address. \"There were 90-odd police officers at the time going through documents \u2026 I did not feel and still don't feel that that particular process was as important as solving a rape or preventing a teenage killing and I wanted to make sure the commissioner had his priorities balanced across all the crime types that he had to face. There was nothing secret about it. \"Indeed, a number of members of the police authority, who are sitting here, did exactly the same in public at the time \u2013 challenged the commissioner about the allocation of resources. That's all I was doing.\" Malthouse sparked tensions with the Met in 2009 when he said that the Conservative administration at city hall had decided to be \"more influential\" over Scotland Yard.",

Many combine their love of socialising with work by acting as promoters for club nights. Promotion companies appealingly often don't require formal or academic experience. Sophie Phylakatou, an undergraduate at Newcastle University, says she was spotted on the street and simply \"offered a job on the spot to promote for a night at the Student Union\". When a job offer is based on appearance and a bubbly personality, not the credentials or experience, it gives an insight into where priorities lay. However, working as a club promoter doesn't guarantee money. Often payment is commission based and what your earn is dependent on how many people you persuade through the club door, or how many 'bar crawl' T-shirts are sold. When commission is a paltry \u00a32 per head, the reality of the job becomes apparent and the reliable monthly income of contracted part-time jobs becomes more attractive. So why do people take the job? And what exactly is meant by promoting?

      "bodyText": "Has anybody considered the Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini for the England job? He's proving himself the equal of Harry Redknapp, is all, certainly when it comes to unnecessarily flapping his gums about players from other teams.

The latter transfer would force the Baggies manager Roy Hodgson into picking a new member of staff to repeatedly castigate in public whenever anything goes wrong.

Juventus seem to be finally back, only a few years after coming back. And having snatched Paul Pogba from Manchester United, they're now looking to further bolster their midfield with Arsenal's Alex Song and 2005's Michael Essien.

Harry Redknapp plans to sign the defender Ezekiel Fryers, making off with the smile of a man who has just won the chop and sausage platter in the Sunday raffle at his local drinker. Chelsea won't be appointing Rafael Ben\u00edtez, after their fans reacted angrily to the idea at Birmingham the other night. Three or four or maybe just two of them waved a bedsheet about with \"No Ben\u00edtez at the bridge\" scrawled on it, a brazen snook cocked to the two-time La Liga winner, and to typography. Robbie Fowler's move to Blackpool has fallen through after he was offered a wage of \u00a3100 a week. An arch reference there to Johnny Haynes by the chairman Karl Oyston, the Tommy Trinder of this piece. Cutting-edge nods to Fulham inside-forwards from the 1950s, and hosts of Val Parnell's Sunday Night at the London Palladium; you lucky people! The Billy Fury fan Gregg Wylde, formerly of Rangers FC RIP, won't need to haul his carcass down the job centre to sign on. He's a target for Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers, Southampton, Blackpool and Bristol City. While we're on the subject of Rangers, the former director Paul Murray and the Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy are both interested in purchasing the stricken Scottish champions, while Mervan Celik is off to the job centre. And Stoke City are chasing after the Blackpool winger Matt Phillips.",

The UK's fourth biggest grocer cautioned on Thursday that the outlook for retailers remained tough as shoppers struggle to cope with rising costs and slow wage growth. But it indicated the difficult backdrop in 2011 had helped it win customers thanks to \"sharp pricing\", and shopper numbers had hit a record 400,000 a week. That boosted underlying pre-tax profits by 8% to \u00a3935m as like-for-like sales edged up 1.8% in the year to 29 January. The chief executive, Dalton Philips, said: \"This has been Morrisons' best year yet with another good financial performance and growth ahead of the market. \"We know that 2012 will be tough, and we will be working hard to deliver even better value for our customers. At the same time, we have ambitious plans for the long-term development of the business, through new supermarkets, convenience stores and the development of our multi-channel capabilities.\" Shares in the company opened up around 2.5% at 293p after Morrisons announced an 11% increase in its dividend. Flagging up the pressures on consumers, Morrisons reported that people were paying an average of 15% more a litre at the fuel pump than they did a year earlier while many food prices had also soared. Market prices for beef and lamb rose by 15% and 11% respectively, and average wheat prices were up by 32%. Against that backdrop, shoppers now regarded price as their first consideration when choosing between products, Morrisons said. It painted a picture of people planning ahead for their grocery shopping based on promotions, saying almost seven out of 10 now say they make the majority of their grocery shopping decisions before they get to the store. \"Promotions are increasingly important when shoppers are deciding which stores to shop at and what products to buy. 70% of shoppers say promotions play a very important role in determining which stores they shop in compared to 64% of shoppers in December 2010,\" the company added.",

      "bodyText": "The government's care and support white paper comes at a critical moment not just for social care, but for the future of social work as a profession. Care services minister Paul Burstow has promised that social work will be at the heart of the white paper. So it must be, if the people who use services are not to be deprived of the professional support they require to make the best of their lives. In our white paper recommendations, sent to Burstow last month, the College of Social Work urges the government to act on the evidence from service users that, for many of them, the support of social workers is indispensable if they are to live the lives they want. The values, skills and knowledge of social workers can help to deliver the outcomes that service users seek. Ministers must use the white paper to spell out their strategy for social work in care services for adults. This is because it is becoming increasingly clear that some local authorities do not understand social work or what it can do for the most vulnerable members of our communities. A toxic mix of cuts and muddled thinking about personalisation has led some to suggest that social work is an optional extra in adult social care. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our recent summit on social work with adults heard from Peter Beresford, chair of user group Shaping Our Lives, that the evidence points entirely the other way. We all want a world in which people are free to live as independently as possible and to have a personal budget if this is what they want. As people take on the risks that accompany greater independence, so the importance of the social work understanding of how to support appropriate risk-taking and how to safeguard vulnerable adults becomes a higher priority. Ensuring that formal safeguarding arrangements work in the best interests of adults is a function that ought to be carried out by qualified social workers. They know how the law operates, they are familiar with the evidence about what works, and have a set of skills rooted in knowledge and values that arise uniquely from an education in social work. The attacks on social work unleashed by the financial cuts suggest that some employers simply do not recognise its value to service users. Just as the government endorsed the Munro review proposal for a post of principal child and family social worker, we believe there should be an equivalent post in the adult and mental health specialisms. It would provide professional leadership locally to develop self-confident and effective social work that is respected in increasingly diverse and generalist council departments. Social workers are being liberated from the straitjacket of care management so that they can build more creative relationships with service users. They can also trial new methods of working with service users to find ways of meeting their needs for care and support. Community social work is making a comeback and the economic case for prevention rather than cure is stronger than ever. These are exciting times for the profession. Most social workers say they always wanted to be advocates for users rather than \"care management bean-counters\".

      "bodyText": "In the opening chapter of his new novel, Dan Rhodes describes a young student in Paris throwing a stone into the air which unfortunately lands on the face of a baby called Herbert (pronounced \"Air-bear\" in France). This leads to the convergence of many far-fetched stories. This Is Life appears to mark a very deliberate change in the style and form of Rhodes's fiction. For one thing, it is almost as long as the sum of all his previous novels: Timoleon Vieta Come Home, Gold, Little Hands Clapping and The Little White Car, which he wrote under the name Danuta de Rhodes (the acknowledgments page in this novel gives special thanks \"to the true author of this work, the petite, beautiful and forever young Danuta de Rhodes \u2013 cruelly felled in her prime\"). In one sense this change of tone and focus is similar to that between Michel Faber's short, original and disturbing semi-science fiction novel Under the Skin and the well-crafted, obvious bestseller The Crimson Petal and the White. Does this suggest that Rhodes is also about to move into the bestseller lists? There is some evidence to suggest this may be in his mind. In one scene Sylvie, a girl with many jobs, sells an admirer a copy of her favourite novel Timol\u00e9on, chien fid\u00e8le (a translation of Rhodes's tragic version of Lassie Come Home). \"I love the ending,\" Sylvie says. \"It's not easy to read, but it says something that needs to be said. I don't think I could ever really be friends with anyone who didn't get this book.\" And her admirer replies: \"I love the ending too. I'm buying it to depress a friend of mine who's been a bit too happy lately.\" Both of them agree on the author's brilliance and \"how underappreciated he was\". Perhaps some readers shuddered when being led into The Anchor, the bleak and oppressive Welsh pub in Rhodes's novel Gold, where a few dull and doleful customers steadily drink their pints of Brains before surrendering to the evening pub quiz at which Septic Barry's local team, \"The Children of Previous Relationships\", has never won a match (except when the other team failed to turn up). It is even possible, I suppose, that some may have balked at entering the museum where Little Hands Clapping is set. This is a German museum that inspires suicide among its visitors; the caretaker swallows live spiders by night, before superintending the removal of the refrigerated corpses of these suicidal visitors to the local butcher. As for the ending of Rhodes's Lassie novel, the \"sentimental journey\" which his fictional fans recommend so highly, it is appallingly sad; some sensitive critics have even called it cruel. Over the last decade Rhodes's fiction has grown darker and more nightmarish, but This Is Life is his farewell to tragedy. It is a happy book about love, from the author of the lacerating short story collection Don't Tell Me the Truth about Love (the epigraph came from Iago's speech inviting us to \"Drown cats and blind puppies\"). Is he now telling us the truth about love? Or has he become sentimental? It is remarkable indeed for characters in a Dan Rhodes novel to get to the point where \"everything was as wonderful as they had known it would be\". So love is triumphant; and justice, too, predominates. Even baby \"Air-bear\", when fortuitously reunited with his mother, loses his italics and regains the romantic dignity of his real name, Olivier. Inevitably there are some dark notes. The boy who holds his breath for longer than a cormorant can stay under water subsides into an unending coma, and the sympathetic translator, who loves someone who does not love him, goes for solace into a monastery (he does find some comfort, not in the religion of the place, but from the fruit and vegetables he tends). So what has happened to Rhodes? It is as if Samuel Beckett had suddenly come up with a glorious, high-spirited comedy. The desperate, idiosyncratic characters of his earlier macabre novels are not abandoned, but they are clothed now in a more traditional habit of storytelling that reveals how their craziness arises from understandable and even sometimes admirable origins. The author is generous and forgiving to them. When the art student accidentally shoots the baby she is looking after, Rhodes allows the bullet merely to graze the baby's arm. I tremble to think what might have happened to this baby in his previous fiction. The comedy is invigorated by some sharp political and artistic irony involving President Sarkozy, Carla Bruni and even (at a distance) Lady Gaga. But grief and darkness are always near. They are most ominously present in the title of the novel, which refers to a theatre presentation of daily routine and bodily functions called Life; this remorselessly shows the characters how much, each day, we leave behind with our faeces and urine and sweat. The \"something that needs to be said\" in Rhodes's previous novels is that sentimentality is a false medicine bringing little contentment, encouraging disappointment and provoking our vengeance. This novel cleverly avoids such dangerous medicine. It is a reminder of how strange ordinary life is and it challenges us to \"adjust to the darkness\". \u2022 Michael Holroyd's A Book of Secrets is published by Vintage.",

      "body": "<p>In the opening chapter of his new novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/dan-rhodes\" title=\"\">Dan Rhodes</a> describes a young student in Paris throwing a stone into the air which unfortunately lands on the face of a baby called Herbert (pronounced \"Air-bear\" in France). This leads to the convergence of many far-fetched stories.</p> <p><em>This Is Life</em> appears to mark a very deliberate change in the style and form of Rhodes's fiction. For one thing, it is almost as long as the sum of all his previous novels: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview15\" title=\"\"><em>Timoleon Vieta Come Home</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview9\" title=\"\"><em>Gold</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/little-hands-clapping-dan-rhodes\" title=\"\"><em>Little Hands Clapping</em></a> and <em>The Little White Car</em>, which he wrote under the name Danuta de Rhodes (the acknowledgments page in this novel gives special thanks \"to the true author of this work, the petite, beautiful and forever young Danuta de Rhodes \u2013 cruelly felled in her prime\"). In one sense this change of tone and focus is similar to that between Michel Faber's short, original and disturbing semi-science fiction novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781841950945/under-the-skin\" title=\"\"><em>Under the Skin</em></a> and the well-crafted, obvious bestseller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780857860019/the-crimson-petal-and-the-white\" title=\"\"><em>The Crimson Petal and the White</em></a>. Does this suggest that Rhodes is also about to move into the bestseller lists?</p> <p>There is some evidence to suggest this may be in his mind. In one scene Sylvie, a girl with many jobs, sells an admirer a copy of her favourite novel <em>Timol\u00e9on, chien fid\u00e8le</em> (a translation of Rhodes's tragic version of <em>Lassie Come Home</em>). \"I love the ending,\" Sylvie says. \"It's not easy to read, but it says something that needs to be said. I don't think I could ever really be friends with anyone who didn't get this book.\" And her admirer replies: \"I love the ending too. I'm buying it to depress a friend of mine who's been a bit too happy lately.\" Both of them agree on the author's brilliance and \"how underappreciated he was\".</p> <p>Perhaps some readers shuddered when being led into The Anchor, the bleak and oppressive Welsh pub in Rhodes's novel <em>Gold</em>, where a few dull and doleful customers steadily drink their pints of Brains before surrendering to the evening pub quiz at which Septic Barry's local team, \"The Children of Previous Relationships\", has never won a match (except when the other team failed to turn up). It is even possible, I suppose, that some may have balked at entering the museum where <em>Little Hands Clapping</em> is set. This is a German museum that inspires suicide among its visitors; the caretaker swallows live spiders by night, before superintending the removal of the refrigerated corpses of these suicidal visitors to the local butcher. As for the ending of Rhodes's Lassie novel, the \"sentimental journey\" which his fictional fans recommend so highly, it is appallingly sad; some sensitive critics have even called it cruel.</p> <p>Over the last decade Rhodes's fiction has grown darker and more nightmarish, but <em>This Is Life</em> is his farewell to tragedy. It is a happy book about love, from the author of the lacerating short story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/short-stories/9781841956138/dont-tell-me-the-truth-about-love\" title=\"\"><em>Don't Tell Me the Truth about Love</em></a> (the epigraph came from Iago's speech inviting us to \"Drown cats and blind puppies\"). Is he now telling us the truth about love? Or has he become sentimental? It is remarkable indeed for characters in a Dan Rhodes novel to get to the point where \"everything was as wonderful as they had known it would be\". So love is triumphant; and justice, too, predominates. Even baby \"Air-bear\", when fortuitously reunited with his mother, loses his italics and regains the romantic&#xa0;dignity of his real name, Olivier.</p> <p>Inevitably there are some dark notes. The boy who holds his breath for longer than a cormorant can stay under water subsides into an unending coma, and the sympathetic translator, who loves someone who does not love him, goes for solace into a monastery (he does find some comfort, not in the religion of the place, but from the fruit and vegetables he tends).</p> <p>So what has happened to Rhodes? It is as if Samuel Beckett had suddenly come up with a glorious, high-spirited comedy. The desperate, idiosyncratic characters of his earlier macabre novels are not abandoned, but they are clothed now in a more traditional habit of storytelling that reveals how their craziness arises from understandable and even sometimes admirable origins. The author is generous and forgiving to them. When the art student accidentally shoots the baby she is looking after, Rhodes allows the bullet merely to graze the baby's arm. I tremble to think what might have happened to this baby in his previous fiction.</p> <p>The comedy is invigorated by some sharp political and artistic irony involving President Sarkozy, Carla Bruni and even (at a distance) Lady Gaga. But grief and darkness are always near. They are most ominously present in the title of the novel, which refers to a theatre presentation of daily routine and bodily functions called <em>Life</em>; this remorselessly shows the characters how much, each day, we leave behind with our faeces and urine and sweat. The \"something that needs to be said\" in Rhodes's previous novels is that sentimentality is a false medicine bringing little contentment, encouraging disappointment and provoking our vengeance. This novel cleverly avoids such dangerous medicine. It is a reminder of how strange ordinary life is and it challenges us to \"adjust to the darkness\".</p> <p>\u2022 Michael Holroyd's <em>A Book of Secrets</em> is published by Vintage.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In an age when journalists have, in large numbers, moved from the bullshit-detection business to the bullshit-promulgation business, it's always welcome to come upon a book that hoists its flag proudly in the first camp. Eliane Glaser's is one such. Her central idea is that we need to revive the good old Marxist notion of false consciousness, and quick. The freer we seem to be, the less free we are. Real disparities of class and power are obscured by blather about opportunity and aspiration. Real arguments are sidestepped by the reluctance of politicians to draw overt ideological lines in the sand. The rhetoric of bottom-up reform, people-power and choice masks gross abdications of top-down responsibility. \"Christians!\" our Neros are saying: \"We're pioneering a new system of lion self-regulation and empowering you to live the dream of a progressive Christian/Lion stakeholder partnership!\" Glaser, let it be said, is not wrong, and she sets about to cover a huge sweep of territory: from beyond-left-and-right managerialism in political rhetoric, through astroturfing and greenwashing, techno-utopianism, food politics, gender politics, modern attitudes to science, the change in western workplace culture \u2026 All modern life is here, and on fast-forward. The sheer range, alas, means that much comes second-hand. The theoretical work has mostly been done, as she acknowledges, by the likes of Marx, Adorno and Bourdieu. The practical \u2013 ie journalistic \u2013 work has, again as she acknowledges with generous quotation, also largely been done by others such as Naomi Klein, George Monbiot, Nick Davies or Felicity Lawrence. Glaser herself is more theorist than reporter. When a piece of pathetic Coca-Cola greenwashing (the trumpeted launch of the Plantbottle, with promises to produce 2bn \u2013 of, ahem, an annual 580bn \u2013 pop bottles out of 15 to 30% plant-based material) was applauded as \"a revolutionary solution\" by an organisation called the Climate Group, Glaser writes: \"This seemed to me to be something of an overstatement, so I did a bit of digging to try to work out just how green the Climate Group really is.\" Her \"digging\", at least from the evidence she presents, consisted of looking it up on Wikipedia, googling some cuts and then concluding: \"It was pretty hard to find out.\" Heigh ho: on to the next thing. The advertised virtue of this book is its sceptical rigour. I'm afraid it doesn't live up to its promises. Rather, like a TV talent show promoting the idea of social mobility, Get Real promotes the idea of scepticism but doesn't do much to promote a method. We're told ex cathedra that rules banning alcohol on the tube \"appeal to an imaginary generalised will, but are basically just there so that Boris's ilk can enjoy a civilised commute home free from the beer-swilling rabble, before popping open the prosecco in the privacy of their own dining rooms\". The evidence she provides that Coalition public-spending cuts \"were indeed driven by a rightwing ideological intent\" is that \"you could see that in the enthusiasm with which cheering Tory back-benchers waved their order papers\". At the higher level the same obeisance to received ideas is in evidence. Lacan gets a free pass apparently because (via that old wife-strangler Louis Althusser) he is congenial to the author's outlook. Glaser is rightly sceptical of the claims made (usually by journalists rather than neuroscientists) for neuroscience and brain imaging \u2013 but it couldn't hurt to admit that buying into Lacan's \"Mirror Stage\" involves some fairly tenuous leaps from the observational data. The rightness of Freud's three-part psychoanalytic scheme, likewise, is assumed \u2013 although Glaser, unlike proper Freudians including Freud himself, uses \"subconscious\" and \"unconscious\" interchangeably. Small sloppinesses are common. \"Machinima\" isn't a \"computer programme\" but a genre. Derrida wasn't a literary critic. Gramsci, Althusser and Adorno weren't \"post-modernists\". Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs can hardly be said to be presenting themselves as \"realer-than-thou\": both are highly stylised and fourth-wall-breaking films. The bigger problem is Glaser's broad-brush thinking. It often elides potentially interesting distinctions. The internet, for instance, in one of the weakest chapters, is treated as a monolithic object. Yes, be sceptical about all that Web 2.0 baloney about people-power: but note too that Google's way of monetising the web and Apple's walled-garden model are different in interesting ways. Not all evil corporations have the same evil plan. It doesn't do to write off computer games \u2013 in implied contradistinction to traditional artistic productions \u2013 as \"a sterile metal-and-plastic box\", or harrumph: \"Interactive games are becoming so popular in museums that children soon won't tolerate learning anything unless it involves touch-screen technology.\" That sort of overcooked generalisation abounds. \"Web 2.0 evangelism risks erasing centuries of human civilisation and returning us to the dark ages,\" she writes. Really? Immersive TV \"underestimates viewers' rationality and helps screens take over our lives\". Really? She even finds it in her heart to be outraged about Compare the Meerkat, complaining that it's \"more pernicious than a straightforward insurance-comparison site, because it's providing recreation, not cynically selling\". And how are we to begin to unpack a sentence like this: \"I'll be arguing that science should be a tool for overt ideologies, a way of enabling us to achieve democratically agreed ideals.\" Particularly in a book where the author is arguing that material inequities are obscured by the language of aspiration, and that people are hoodwinked into voting for the wrong things, it's a bit of a snake eating its tail. Which ideals? Democratic how? And should science be \"a tool\"? It's not always clear the author knows exactly what she means. When she writes: \"The Nasdaq crash of 2001 seems not to have dented the enthusiasm of cyber-utopians today,\" that's a non-sequitur: the over-valuation of dotcom stocks a decade ago is one issue; the transformative potential of any and all electronic technologies is another. Of Antony Gormley's \"One &amp; Other\" \u2013 where a succession of ordinary people got to spend an hour on the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square \u2013 she reports disappointedly: \"There was relatively little nudity, public defecation or other evidence of iconoclastic rebellion.\" Well. Those things are nice and fun, obviously \u2013 but they're hardly the infallible signs of someone Sticking It to the Man. And for all her talk of busting taboos, there is very little here that will come as a surprise to a moderately attentive reader of this newspaper. The Tea Party isn't a genuinely grassroots movement. Supermarkets and political parties offer the illusion of choice but resist supplying the information that makes those choices meaningful. TV presents fantasies of overnight success as a sop to those suffering real socioeconomic disadvantage. Jamie Oliver doesn't dig his own carrots. Avatar doesn't present a realistic plan for saving the planet from global warming. David Cameron is a millionaire. Glaser is caught in a classic High-Table liberal bind: she believes in power to the people but has a pretty low opinion of the average person's ability to tell the difference between Hollywood films and real life. Again and again she overstates, telling us how \"we\" are hoodwinked in ways that only the author and a select few are able to decode. More often than seems necessary \u2013 and rather against the grain of her thesis \u2013 she personalises her argument. \"I've long been a fan of Nigel Slater,\" she confides. \"I'm fine with Heston Blumenthal,\" she reassures us. \"I am tired of\" X, she writes. \"I smell a rat\" about Y. \"I am heartily sick\" of Z. I feel as if I'm being meaner than really I want to. I'm broadly on Glaser's side. Get Real is unexceptionable in its broad outline \u2013 and sprinkled with interesting nuggets of fact. Glaser is dead on about the way that corporate interests co-opt resistance, that the illusion of choice comes to substitute for the real thing, and that various apparently progressive positions \u2013 from neo-Darwinian science to the natural birth movement \u2013 can subtly downgrade the idea of human agency and serve sneakingly conservative agendas. But there's clearer writing and clearer thinking on these subjects to be found elsewhere. \u2022 Sam Leith's You Talkin' To Me? is published by Profile.",

      "bodyText": "The fight against inequality is a very important political goal. But what does inequality look like across our cities? And does it act as a drag on economic growth? The Cities Outlook 2012 attempts to measure inequality in our cities. While there are many ways to look at inequality, this research looks at the difference in unemployment in the worst and least affected neighbourhoods within each city. It finds that Cambridge is the most equal city in Great Britain, while Rochdale is the least. In Cambridge there was a 5.4 percentage point difference between the jobs seekers' allowance (JSA) claimant rates in the city's least and most deprived neighbourhoods. In Rochdale it was 29.2 percentage points; in the least affected neighbourhood just 1.2% of the population were claiming JSA, while around 30% were claiming it in the most affected neighbourhood. It seems that the more economically successful the city, the more equal its population. But looking at the bottom 10 cities reveals that three of the UK's strongest economies \u2013 Leeds, Edinburgh and London \u2013 are also among its most unequal cities. This is in part because successful cities attract poorer people, because of the personal opportunities that can be found there. London is the most obvious example of this. The economic opportunity that lies within the capital is a clear reason why it has attracted so many nationalities, in the same way that South Asian migrants moved to the textile towns of Lancashire after the Second World War. Low levels of inequality in Cambridge may actually be a sign of failing planning policy, rather than economic success. High house prices are likely to be pricing potential migrants out of the economic opportunities available there. Cambridge has the third-highest house prices out of all UK cities. It isn't necessarily the case that Cambridge's success has reduced inequality \u2013 it's more likely that its planning has pushed some communities out. Inequality isn't necessarily a sign of urban failure. Rather, and perversely, it can reflect the strength of an urban economy. As urban economist Professor Ed Glaesar points out, photographs of the shanty towns of Sao Paulo set against the backdrop of skyscrapers may seem galling, but the reason those people have moved from the countryside to the shanty town is because they are attracted by the city's opportunity. Clearly the shanty towns of South America are far removed from the more deprived neighbourhoods in cities in the UK. But this has an important lesson for policy: shanty towns have allowed the expansion of some of the developing world's urban powerhouses. UK planning policy can learn from the sentiment \u2013 if not the application \u2013 of shanty towns, by supporting house building in some of our most successful cities. This would reduce the threat of people being priced out of the economic chances that dwell within our best-performing cities. Inequality in itself is not the sign of a failing city, but can rather be a sign of success. This doesn't mean that inequality should not be tackled \u2013 but it does mean that a different policy response is required depending on the city. In cities such as Cambridge, a change in the approach to planning is required. Meanwhile in places such as Rochdale there needs to be a greater focus on the causes of worklessness, principally focusing on skills.

      "body": "<p>The fight against inequality is a very important political goal. But what does inequality look like across our cities? And does it act as a drag on economic growth?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.citiesoutlook.org/jsa-disparities/percentage-point-difference-between-highest-lowest-jsa-rate-november-2011/chart\">Cities Outlook 2012</a> attempts to measure inequality in our cities. While there are many ways to look at inequality, this research looks at the difference in unemployment in the worst and least affected neighbourhoods within each city.</p> <p>It finds that Cambridge is the most equal city in Great Britain, while Rochdale is the least. In Cambridge there was a 5.4 percentage point difference between the jobs seekers' allowance (JSA) claimant rates in the city's least and most deprived neighbourhoods. In Rochdale it was 29.2 percentage points; in the least affected neighbourhood just 1.2% of the population were claiming JSA, while around 30% were claiming it in the most affected neighbourhood.</p> <p>It seems that the more economically successful the city, the more equal its population. But looking at the bottom 10 cities reveals that three of the UK's strongest economies \u2013 Leeds, Edinburgh and London \u2013 are also among its most unequal cities.</p> <p>This is in part because successful cities attract poorer people, because of the personal opportunities that can be found there. London is the most obvious example of this. The economic opportunity that lies within the capital is a clear reason why it has attracted so many nationalities, in the same way that South Asian migrants moved to the textile towns of Lancashire after the Second World War.</p> <p>Low levels of inequality in Cambridge may actually be a sign of failing planning policy, rather than economic success. High house prices are likely to be pricing potential migrants out of the economic opportunities available there. Cambridge has the third-highest house prices out of all UK cities. It isn't necessarily the case that Cambridge's success has reduced inequality \u2013 it's more likely that its planning has pushed some communities out.</p> <p>Inequality isn't necessarily a sign of urban failure.

The book is written in a diary style by Adrian Mole, a thirteen year old boy who, although writes confidently, often misinterprets and does not understand the events that go on around him. The book follows him through the year of 1981 and a bit of 1982, starting with his new year's resolutions including \"stopping squeezing my spots\" and \"vowing to never drink alcohol... after hearing disgusting noises from downstairs last night.\" Mole is a self-described intellectual who writes unreliably about the events he goes through and his troubles as an adolescent - resulting in a light-hearted and amusing book. He writes bluntly about his parents' marital troubles and his own relationship with Pandora, a fellow Year 9 with beautiful \"treacle hair\": \"Pandora and I are in love! It is official! She told Claire Nelson, who told Nigel, who told me.\" Adrian Mole also writes about his cringe-worthy poetry, his troubles at school, his acne problem, the Royal Wedding and his eighty-year old friend Bert, and numerous other events. I would highly recommend this book. It is a hilarious book to read and is still relevant today. It is especially amusing if you are around Adrian's age (12-ish to 16-ish), because then you will really appreciate and understand when he says \"Just my luck! Another spot on my chin!\". It is not only witty, but deeply touching, too. Great as a stress reliever, this book will provide hours of entertainment for everyone. Want to tell the world about a book you've read?

      "bodyText": "Managing the UK's borders and controlling migration is a complex task. Deterring, detecting and disrupting the illegal movement of people and goods while at the same time smoothing passage for the legitimate traveller is a massive challenge in a world where those who would seek to do harm through organised crime and terrorism are internationally organised and increasingly sophisticated. The much-publicised split of the UK Border Agency (UKBA) into two separate entities is being heralded as the latest cure for the ills of this often-maligned organisation. Creating a discrete Border Force will bring focus to one area of responsibility, but it is vital that the new force remains connected with the agency at the information and operational level if controls are to be effective, efficient and responsive to ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated threats. The new Border Force will inherit considerable legal powers to support the discharge of its responsibilities. Its challenge will be to organise and direct operations to ensure that these powers achieve the results they were designed to deliver. But the Border Agency itself does not enjoy the same clarity of purpose or legislative framework under which to operate. For all its troubles, the UKBA never lacked the vision or ambition to meet its mandate. Over the past decade it has enjoyed significant successes, delivering ground-breaking solutions to some of its key challenges. These include the Application Registration Card scheme, which enabled identity checks for asylum claimants 10 years ago, and the biometric visa scheme, which set the standard for assured identity in the visa process. In addition, the agency's Project Semaphore produces vital intelligence based on the Advanced Passenger Information provided by carriers and has maintained an operational connection between itself, the police and security agencies. Other countries have yet to deliver such schemes. Caseworking will remain a major issue for the new agency. More than 10 years after the failure to deliver a new computer system, the latest IT project to address the endemic difficulty of processing immigration and asylum cases is already late and running into familiar problems. Staff are demotivated as they struggle to apply complex immigration rules with inadequate IT and the certain knowledge that even the most carefully considered cases are subject to a multi-layered appeals and review process. Developing business process and supporting IT systems to deliver the current legislation is a massive and challenging task. The 1971 Immigration Act, amended and supplemented by the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act, the 2002 Nationality and Immigration Act and a raft of secondary legislation, provide a legal labyrinth for the agency's staff to navigate. Even if successful \u2013 and there is a significant risk of failure \u2013 IT will not provide the answer on its own. It is an important enabler but simplifying legislation must be a priority for government if the underlying issue is to be addressed. The current legislation is not fit for purpose. Only when it is improved can effectiveness and efficiency be improved, even under the new proposed arrangements. Splitting the agency will not deliver this, but could provide a fertile environment for change if the opportunity is recognised and taken. It is right for ministers to look for answers. Indeed it is their duty. But the focus on operational failure at the border may be a diversion, addressing symptom rather than root cause. It is the root-cause reasons that need to be explored \u2013 and, indeed, if these had been addressed earlier it may have prevented the well-publicised operating failures. The 2006 Borders, Immigration and Identity Action Plan set out a coherent and ambitious strategy for change. The reasons behind the difficulties the agency and industry have had in delivering vital components of this strategy need to be identified and addressed. And now, at this time of structural change, is a good time to do so. In part the answers are not complicated. The successes the agency has enjoyed have often been associated with focused projects that integrate its operational activity and intelligence base. Biometric visas were delivered early and under budget and they made an immediate and dramatic impact on visa controls. Equally, Semaphore delivered valuable results, leading to significant counter-terrorist interventions as well as numerous arrests for offences including murder, kidnapping and assault. Ministers and the new management of the agency and Border Force should therefore reflect on the opportunity before them, address the crippling effect of current legislation and immigration rules and identify those critical intelligence and operational dots that need to remain joined up. They must agree a directed, coherent strategy that focuses resources and provides adequate finance to allow the new organisations to deliver where it matters most through small and tightly focused projects.

      "bodyText": "New arrivals in Britain are highly dependent on private lettings \u2013 whether bedsits, accommodation tied to their jobs or caravan sites. Recent migrants are three times more likely than the average person to be living in the private rented sector (PRS). Many endure poor conditions, irregular tenancies, overcrowding and even \"hot bedding\", where tenants use the same bed and sleep in shifts. The difficulty in helping them is that they often find accommodation informally or through employers, don't use official advice centres and may find it difficult to report high rents or poor conditions. A growing number of councils and housing associations are trying to improve migrants' living conditions. Successful schemes recognise the need to work with migrants and be sensitive to a range of issues, from language barriers and a suspicion of authority to the fear that if they are seen to complain they may lose both their home and their job. Tackling these problems means investing time in liaising with tenants, employing staff who speak the relevant languages and, where possible, working in partnership with migrant community organisations. In Hastings, East Sussex, migrants live in bedsits. Local councils used a Migration Impact Fund (MIF) to employ a liaison worker who met migrant groups, learned about their needs and produced a best practice toolkit for use by environmental health officers. They went on to produce an English language resource for migrants that had the double purpose of helping them understand their housing rights. In Cornwall, councils started to see a growing problem of migrant workers being housed in poor-quality caravan sites and bedsits. They formed a group called MIGWAG, which brings councils together with agencies such as the police, fire service and the Gangmasters Licensing Authority. These join forces to tackle poor conditions and even close down caravan sites, but also work with farmers and growers to encourage them to provide better conditions for staff and observe health and safety rules. A sudden growth in conversions of properties to bedsits, in response to demand from migrant workers, has affected many places in eastern England. In Goole, between 3,000 and 5,000 migrant workers have settled and there has been an increase in two-storey houses being converted to homes of multiple occupation outside the council's standard licensing scheme. Not all were well run, meaning that the tenants were at risk and there was a growing problem of neighbourhood nuisance. Goole applied for permission to have an additional licensing scheme. The impact fund paid for a consultant to gather evidence of why it was needed and the scheme began in January 2011. Finally, a group of housing associations and councils are working with HACT's Accommodate PRS project to establish private rented access or leasing schemes in four different areas of the country \u2013 Bolton, Haringey, Sandwell and Redbridge. One of these is a leasing scheme led by Bolton at Home, working with Bolton council and the North West Strategic Migration Partnership. It aims to become self-financing and includes a refugee-specific element, with a target of 150 refugee households over two years. It is looking to expand to work with partners in other areas such as Rochdale, Salford and Wigan. In each case, it will lease private-sector properties, providing a guaranteed income for the landlord and good management standards for tenants. There are more ideas and examples in a new report from the Housing and Migration Network. The next publication, in April, will be a general practical guide to improving housing conditions for migrants, covering aspects such as gathering data about migrants, eligibility for and access to social housing and helping those who are destitute.

The difficulty in helping them is that they often find accommodation informally or through employers, don't use official advice centres and may find it difficult to report high rents or poor conditions.</p> <p>A growing number of councils and housing associations are trying to improve migrants' living conditions. Successful schemes recognise the need to work with migrants and be sensitive to a range of issues, from language barriers and a suspicion of authority to the fear that if they are seen to complain they may lose both their home and their job.</p> <p>Tackling these problems means investing time in liaising with tenants, employing staff who speak the relevant languages and, where possible, working in partnership with migrant community organisations.</p> <p>In Hastings, East Sussex, migrants live in bedsits. Local councils used a Migration Impact Fund (MIF) to employ a liaison worker who met migrant groups, learned about their needs and produced a <a href=\"http://www.hastings.gov.uk/housing_tax_benefits/help_housing_tax/migrant_housing_toolkit\" title=\"\">best practice toolkit</a> for use by environmental health officers. They went on to produce an English language resource for migrants that had the double purpose of helping them understand their housing rights.</p> <p>In Cornwall, councils started to see a growing problem of migrant workers being housed in poor-quality caravan sites and bedsits. They formed a group called <a href=\"http://www.wchlc.org.uk/mignewsforumpublic.cfm\" title=\"\">MIGWAG</a>, which brings councils together with agencies such as the police, fire service and the Gangmasters Licensing Authority. These join forces to tackle poor conditions and even close down caravan sites, but also work with farmers and growers to encourage them to provide better conditions for staff and observe health and safety rules.</p> <p>A sudden growth in conversions of properties to bedsits, in response to demand from migrant workers, has affected many places in eastern England. In Goole, between 3,000 and 5,000 migrant workers have settled and there has been an increase in two-storey houses being converted to homes of multiple occupation outside the council's standard licensing scheme.</p> <p>Not all were well run, meaning that the tenants were at risk and there was a growing problem of neighbourhood nuisance. Goole applied for permission to have an additional licensing scheme. The impact fund <a href=\"http://www2.eastriding.gov.uk/business/licences-and-registrations/available-licences/other-licences/houses-in-multiple-occupation/\" title=\"\">paid for a consultant</a> to gather evidence of why it was needed and the scheme began in January 2011.</p> <p>Finally, a group of housing associations and councils are working with <a href=\"http://hact.org.uk/accommodate-prs-2\" title=\"\">HACT's Accommodate PRS project</a> to establish private rented access or leasing schemes in four different areas of the country \u2013 Bolton, Haringey, Sandwell and Redbridge. One of these is a leasing scheme led by Bolton at Home, working with Bolton council and the North West Strategic Migration Partnership. It aims to become self-financing and includes a refugee-specific element, with a target of 150 refugee households over two years. It is looking to expand to work with partners in other areas such as Rochdale, Salford and Wigan.</p> <p>In each case, it will lease private-sector properties, providing a guaranteed income for the landlord and good management standards for tenants.</p> <p>There are more ideas and examples in <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/uk-migrants-private-rented-sector\" title=\"\">a new report</a> from the Housing and Migration Network. The next publication, in April, will be a general practical guide to improving housing conditions for migrants, covering aspects such as gathering data about migrants, eligibility for and access to social housing and helping those who are destitute.</p> <p><em>John Perry is policy adviser to the </em><a href=\"http://www.cih.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Chartered Institute of Housing</em></a><em> and a member of the </em><a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/housing-and-migration\" title=\"\"><em>Housing and Migration Network</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to your inbox</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "With ongoing news of inequality, unequal pay and a lack women at boardroom level, businesswomen clearly still have challenges to face. I've been running my PR agency Boomerang for four years now and it certainly hasn't been easy. Seven-day weeks, 12-hour days \u2013 it's tough, but being a woman hasn't even come into it in my opinion. There have been rare occasions when I've suddenly become uncomfortably aware of my gender. A prospective client once asked questions that hinted at whether I intended to have children \u2013 I suppose my answer would have determined his decision to hire me. Then there's the look of surprise when you tell certain men you are the managing director or the misogynistic comments, patronizing remarks and not being treated as an equal in meetings. But despite the odd experience, I don't believe being a woman has held me back or altered my chance of success. Being a successful businesswoman really comes down to personality. I've always been fiercely independent, confident and determined to succeed. And whenever I meet other female entrepreneurs, they share similar characteristics. With this in mind, if you're a woman (or indeed a man) who wants to start your own business, read the following top 10 traits that I believe make a successful entrepreneur. Self-belief Look at any successful businesswoman and you will discover how much they truly believe in themselves. Self-belief is probably the single most important trait possessed by any successful entrepreneur. If you don't believe you can succeed, then you won't get very far. In the words of Mary Kay Ash who founded Mary Kay Cosmetics: \"If you think you can, you can. And if you think you can't, you're right.\" This was a woman who continued to build her business, just a month after her husband's death. Ambition Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg recently challenged women to have the courage to be as ambitious as men. While this makes me cringe because all the women I've ever known are ambitious, it's definitely a trait that both successful men and women possess. You have to really want something if you're going to succeed. And you should never settle for second best. Always strive to push forward. Always aim for the top. What's stopping you? Confidence Confidence is essential if you want to win clients and build a profitable business. Confidence will win people's respect, earn their trust and gain you a solid reputation. When walking into any room, hold your head up high and stand tall. When greeting people for the first time, smile, shake their hand, hold eye contact \u2013 be confident. And if you're having an 'off day' repeat positive affirmations in your head. Take inspiration from female aviator Beryl Markham: \"Success breeds confidence.\" Passion Successful female entrepreneurs are always passionate about what they do because they tend to create businesses around the things they enjoy. Oprah Winfrey suffered a difficult childhood, then built a career around her passion to help others. Anita Roddick was passionate about environmental and social activism and her company, The Body Shop, was the first to prohibit the use of products tested on animals. Find your own passion, believe in it and turn it into something you can really be proud of. As Anita Roddick once said: \"To succeed you have to believe in something with such a passion that it becomes a reality.\" Humility and a willingness to learn You cannot rest on your laurels when you run your own business. The creative industries are always changing, so you will constantly need to keep up and innovate. Successful female entrepreneurs know this and will work hard to learn and improve all the time. They'll read books, go to workshops and be willing to learn from others. Successful businesswomen will always be humble. They'll never be afraid to admit they don't know everything and will always strive to boost their skills. Sense of purpose There is no point in starting a business unless you possess a strong sense of purpose. You have to believe that you are destined for great (and good) things. Just look at women like Coco Chanel or Oprah Winfrey \u2013 they believed they had a purpose in life. They wanted to make a difference, and they certainly did. To be a successful female entrepreneur you have to believe in yourself and believe that what you are doing is making a difference. That strong sense of purpose will be reflected in your business, which will only stand the test of time. Assertiveness To be a successful businesswoman you have to be assertive, otherwise people will not respect you. Convey assertiveness by being fearless, speaking with authority and purpose. Adopt a confident manner, deal with any criticism rationally and be calm, cool and considered. Hard work Singer Marsha Evans once remarked: \"You can have unbelievable intelligence, you can have connections, you can have opportunities fall out of the sky. But in the end, hard work is the true, enduring characteristic of successful people.\" Even Margaret Thatcher said: \"I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe.\" Hard work is the secret to success. You have to be prepared to work long hours and sacrifice your spare time to build up a business. Bravery Whether you're a man or woman, it takes guts to run a business and deal with all the difficult challenges you will undoubtedly face. You have to constantly push yourself out of your comfort zone to move forward, boost confidence and ultimately succeed. This means you have to take risks and accept that when things go wrong, you can always survive and turn things around. Be brave and you will never look back. Persistence Starting a business is one thing, keeping it going is another matter entirely. To be a successful businesswoman, you have to be persistent and never give up. Granted, there will be days when you feel like sticking your head in the sand. But when you're feeling down, remember why you went solo in the first place. Remind yourself of all the things you've achieved. Stick at it because the next best triumph could be just around the corner.

Opportunities in local government may not seem to be the most obvious, attractive or even secure choice for graduates, but I've found my job in local government has provided me a wealth of opportunities and experiences, with the additional bonus of making a real difference within the local community. I secured a role onto Shropshire Council's Graduate Programme in 2010 after completing a master's in history from the University of Edinburgh. I can already hear the hushed whispers and slight bemusement from readers who have never heard of a place called Shropshire before, and question why someone who was born and bred in a city (Liverpool) would want to move to one of the most rural counties in England. Frankly, it was hard for me to turn this job down; I wanted to join an organisation where I could make a real difference, stand out from the crowd and not become 'just a number' in a corporate conglomerate at the start of my career, and the council turned out to be that organisation. I think graduates who are serious about developing a successful career need to be flexible about where they work and be willing to seize opportunities regardless of geographical location. During the council's graduate recruitment campaign last year, I spoke to many talented graduates who were interested in our programme, but reluctant to move to Shrewsbury in order to develop their professional ambitions. I understand the rationale and reluctance to move to a rural county, and I admit, I had my own reservations. However, these soon evaporated once I realised what an innovative and forward-thinking organisation I had chosen to start my career with. I believe that I was successful in securing a role onto the graduate programme after demonstrating a strategic awareness of the wide range of changes currently taking place in the public sector, both on a national and local level and how those changes related to Shropshire. I emphasised my desire to work in this rapidly changing environment and how I wanted to be at the forefront of implementing a radical programme of change. I also made it clear how the council could benefit from the skills I had acquired during my academic career and previous work experience, tailoring them to the core skills, behaviours and competencies that they were looking for. However, I've discovered that a career in local government, especially during such tough economic conditions, isn't for the faint hearted. I've been working in a rapidly changing environment that many local authorities, members of staff and customers are not accustomed to. To work in this climate, it is imperative to have a strong desire to be a future leader of the public sector and be committed to radically changing the way local authorities operate. I would advise any graduate considering a career in local government to do thorough research into the opportunities available. Many local authorities run their own in-house graduate programmes but lack the financial means to pursue large advertising campaigns so some fantastic job opportunities often go unnoticed. I'd recommend getting in touch with the local authorities that you want to work for and actively find out if they have a graduate programme or offer internships. My decision to move to Shropshire has been a very positive experience and while some of my friends are still struggling to get a foot on the career ladder, I am currently in the process of applying for a permanent role within the authority and excited to see what my future in local government holds. The penthouse apartment on the bank of the Thames is still a distant dream, but I am excited to be climbing the career ladder in Shropshire and happy with my home by the River Severn \u2013 London will just have to wait.

      "bodyText": "At Battlesbury Barracks the flags flew at half-mast and the soldiers guarding the gate were taking care to make sure a candle lit by wives and partners when their loved ones were deployed to Afghanistan continued to burn. When the candle did briefly go out, extinguished by a chilly wind that whipped off Salisbury Plain, it was quickly re-lit. The Wiltshire garrison town of Warminster is the sort of place where everyone knows someone who works in the military. The news that six men \u2013 five of them members of the 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, based at Battlesbury \u2013 were missing, presumed dead, has hit the town hard. The mayor, Pip Ridout, said Warminster was devastated. She said: \"The people of Warminster are tremendously proud of the regiment and they will feel the loss like their own. The soldiers haven't even been out in Afghanistan that long. They left last month but the rest of the battalion were meant to be joining them next week. \"We were going to have a parade for them before they go out next Friday. We lost three from here the last time they were in Afghanistan too. It is terribly upsetting for everyone. The children all go to our local primary schools and they live together in the barracks. It is a very solemn day for us all.\" A service was being held on Wednesday at the town's Minister Church of St Denys to say prayers for the fallen and their families (nobody had any hope that any of the men could have survived), while books of condolence \u2013 one for each fallen soldier \u2013 were being made available at a second church, St Lawrence. Talk in the town inevitably turned to the reasons for British troops still being in Afghanistan. \"I feel so sorry for those boys and their families but it makes me ask again why they are out there in the first place,\" said van driver Jim Pearce. \"I admire their bravery but I don't see why we are involved in their war. I know some lads who have been out there. They are convinced that as soon as they pull out, whenever that is, the place will just collapse again. It makes you wonder what the point is.\" Jill Evans was more blunt: \"Bring them back. They are getting killed for a country that has nothing to do with us. The government should bring them back now before anyone else dies.\" The mood, of course, was sombre across the sprawling garrison. There was little laughing and joking as children walked home from school. The playgrounds were deserted. The only topic of discussion in the Naafi shop was the dreadful news that Warminster woke up to. Wives and other family members have different ways of coping. One member of an army family \u2013 not related to any of those missing \u2013 described how she ticked off the days until her loved one was due back on a calendar in the kitchen. \"It's my favourite time of the day, crossing off that day. He's one more day closer to coming home.\" Another tactic some partners have is to set aside a little time each day to think about the dangers their nearest and dearest are facing and thus try to control or contain the anxiety. As the day wore on mourners laid bouquets of flowers outside the barracks. Former RAF serviceman Lee Thomas, from Warminster, left flowers, explaining: \"I was shocked and saddened when I heard the news this morning. It is really tragic. I have come here and laid flowers out of respect. They are only young lads and the government should do more to protect them.\" Mandy Dillon added a bunch of yellow and white daisies with a message to the fallen soldiers inside: \"Six soldiers reporting for duty at St Peter's gate. My prayers and thoughts are with family and friends. It is such a sad loss.\" That candle at the barracks continued to burn. A sign under it read: \"This flame serves to remind us of the commitment that the soldiers of this battalion are currently making on operations. It will be extinguished when the last soldiers of the battalion returns safely to the base.\" Clearly, now, not all will be returning safely. Three-year-old Olivia-Mai McLaughlin \u2013 whose dad, John, is to fly to Afghanistan in April \u2013 also laid flowers at the entrance to Battlesbury. Her mother, Stacey McLaughlin, 21, who lives in Warminster, spoke through tears about the sudden loss of six lives. She said: \"They are true heroes. This loss will be felt badly by all the soldiers out there and the families back home. \"I just hope John comes back home safely when he goes out there.\" Hayley Dymek, 22, whose husband, Private Darren Dymek, 24, is in Afghanistan with the Yorkshire regiment, said: \"I panicked this morning when I first heard that six soldiers had been killed. But then I found out that the families had been informed, so I knew Darren was safe. \"This really brings home the dangers of what they are doing out there. It has really hit me now. I know what my husband is like \u2013 he takes this hard \u2013 so I am worried about him. They all do such a brave job.\" One message on another bunch of flowers read: \"Gone too soon brave heroes \u2013 Rest In Peace.\"",

To celebrate, here's the full 1987 documentary, King of Cricket, plus a selection of his greatest sixes and the fastest Test century of all time (at his home ground in Antigua to boot). 3) Football + volleyball = fistball. And table tennis + blow football = blo-ball. 4) Rangana Herath. What. A. Catch. 5) Stig Blomqvist in an Audi Quattro for the British Rallycross GP at Brands Hatch. Retro joy. 6) Some more assorted world football clips: Mamelodi Sundowns show no mercy to beat Powerlines FC 24-0 in South Africa; the South American referee Casanova; plus Paolo Guerrero and the most obvious red card of the season. Our favourites from last week's blog 1) In honour of cycling's classic Spring Classics: Freddy Maartens in the 1977 Het Volk, Eddy Merckx wins the 1973 Paris-Roubaix and Johan Museeuw blitzing up the Kapelmuur in the 1998 Tour of Flanders. 2) The harshest red card ever? Sent off while being stretchered off in a mistaken case of simulation. 3) A highlight from the recent Track Cycling World Cup in London: the joy of leading from the front. Plus some of the fastest movers on two wheels. 4) Ten of the best saves from Gigi Buffon. Splendid. 5) The wild world of Australian surf boat racing. 6) Arsenal 2-0 France in 1989 with Martin Hayes and Alan Smith scoring against Michel Platini's team.

      "bodyText": "Why do we all put up with it? Wherever I go in the education sector, I hear people at all levels, from eminent academics to headteachers to TAs, denouncing the way that education policy is made. Their principal objections are the short termism and the stress it causes. Nonetheless, a weary stoicism seems to prevail. As one deputy headteacher put it: \"Every new government thinks it knows best. This means there is constant change. There's nothing you can do about it so you just have to accept it... It's just a pity they never think of consulting teachers.\" The Guardian's survey last autumn did consult teachers and confirmed both that they felt extremely disgruntled and that they felt powerless to change the situation. This is not for lack of ideas about how education should be improved; books and papers on the subject are legion. Why then are those ideas not implemented in a way that commands the profession's respect? Many believe that the core problem is the excessive influence exerted by politicians and civil servants. While many of them are no doubt genuinely concerned about children's futures, they are, as a group, driven by political imperatives, customs and timescales. And, as we can see from the actions of the current Secretary of State for Education, there appears to be little to stop a \"Minister with a Mission\" doing whatever he or she wants with schools \u2013 even though they change every three or four years and most of them have absolutely no credentials in the field. The good news is that recent statements by politicians acknowledge the need for change. Michael Gove's ambitions to streamline the curriculum, give teachers more autonomy and encourage inter-school collaboration seem praiseworthy, even if many of us disagree with his restructuring of the system. Andy Burnham, when shadow Secretary of State for Education last year, made the radical proposal that all political parties should agree on an education entitlement that could be sustained across successive administrations. Now his successor, Stephen Twigg, has made a fine speech about the importance of having evidence-based policy. The bad news is that even Stephen Twigg mars the many good things in his speech with a strangely authoritarian touch. He warns us all, \"Yes, we will drive up rigour and standards\" \u2013 to which my response is, pretty much, \"Yeah? You and whose army?\" The fact is that no politician gives more than a nod to the feelings of the school staff who have to obey their orders. This lack of appreciation is a major cause of teachers' disenchantment \u2013 and it undermines the prospect of education improvement. So, while we can welcome the ideas that politicians contribute, we cannot rely on them to bring about the sustainable policy we need. Instead, we who work in the sector must forge our own strategy - one that commands such widespread support that the politicians and civil servants would look foolish or tyrannical to oppose it. I have drafted some ideas for such a strategy in the form of a charter. It consists of a set of principles to be used as the guiding lights for further debate about practicalities. I would welcome your feedback about how to use or improve the charter, with the aim of firing up all those weary practitioners and reconnecting them with their passion for improving the life chances of the nation's children. Read and comment on the draft Charter for Rational Education Development by Nick Nuttgens. \u2022 In 2005, Nick Nuttgens abandoned a career in theatre to run the Creative Partnerships programme in South Yorkshire, working with schools to support creative approaches to teaching and learning. He is now training as a primary teacher. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Wherever I go in the education sector, I hear people at all levels, from eminent academics to headteachers to TAs, denouncing the way that <a href=\"http://www.tlrp.org/educationforall/EducationforAllRB.pdf\" title=\"education policy is made\">education policy is made</a>. Their principal objections are the short termism and the stress it causes.</p> <p>Nonetheless, a weary stoicism seems to prevail. As one deputy headteacher put it: \"Every new government thinks it knows best. This means there is constant change. There's nothing you can do about it so you just have to accept it... It's just a pity they never think of consulting teachers.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-survey\" title=\"The Guardians survey\">The Guardian's survey</a> last autumn did consult teachers and confirmed both that they felt extremely disgruntled and that they felt powerless to change the situation. This is not for lack of ideas about how education should be improved; books and papers on the subject are legion. Why then are those ideas not implemented in a way that commands the profession's respect?</p> <p>Many believe that the core problem is the excessive influence exerted by politicians and civil servants. While many of them are no doubt genuinely concerned about children's futures, they are, as a group, driven by political imperatives, customs and timescales.</p> <p>And, as we can see from the actions of the current Secretary of State for Education, there appears to be little to stop a \"Minister with a Mission\" doing whatever he or she wants with schools \u2013 even though they change every three or four years and most of them have absolutely no credentials in the field.</p> <p>The good news is that recent statements by politicians acknowledge the need for change. Michael Gove's ambitions to streamline the curriculum, give teachers more autonomy and encourage inter-school collaboration seem praiseworthy, even if many of us disagree with his restructuring of the system.</p> <p>Andy Burnham, when shadow Secretary of State for Education last year, made the radical proposal that all political parties should agree on an education entitlement that could be sustained across successive administrations.</p> <p>Now his successor, Stephen Twigg, has made a fine <a href=\"http://www.labourteachers.org.uk/2012/02/21/evidence-not-dogma-stephen-twiggs-speech-to-progress\" title=\"speech about the importance of having evidence-based policyc\">speech about the importance of having evidence-based policy</a>.</p> <p>The bad news is that even Stephen Twigg mars the many good things in his speech with a strangely authoritarian touch. He warns us all, \"Yes, we will drive up rigour and standards\" \u2013 to which my response is, pretty much, \"Yeah? You and whose army?\" The fact is that no politician gives more than a nod to the feelings of the school staff who have to obey their orders. This lack of appreciation is a major cause of teachers' disenchantment \u2013 and it undermines the prospect of education improvement.</p> <p>So, while we can welcome the ideas that politicians contribute, we cannot rely on them to bring about the sustainable policy we need. Instead, we who work in the sector must forge our own strategy - one that commands such widespread support that the politicians and civil servants would look foolish or tyrannical to oppose it.</p> <p>I have drafted some ideas for such a strategy in the form of a <a href=\"http://teachers.theguardian.com/teacher-resources/6721/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT9366\" title=\"charter\">charter</a>. It consists of a set of principles to be used as the guiding lights for further debate about practicalities. I would welcome your feedback about how to use or improve the charter, with the aim of firing up all those weary practitioners and reconnecting them with their passion for improving the life chances of the nation's children.</p> <h2>Read and comment on the <a href=\"http://teachers.theguardian.com/teacher-resources/6721/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT9366\" title=\"draft Charter for Rational Education Development by Nick Nuttgens\">draft Charter for Rational Education Development by Nick Nuttgens</a>.</h2> <p>\u2022 In 2005, Nick Nuttgens abandoned a career in theatre to run the <a href=\"http://www.creative-partnerships.com\" title=\"Creative Partnerships\">Creative Partnerships</a> programme in South Yorkshire, working with schools to support creative approaches to teaching and learning.

      "bodyText": "\"We can only sense that in the deep and turbulent recesses of the sea are hidden mysteries far greater than any we have solved.\" ~ Rachel Carson, 1907-1964. Oceans cover more than 70% of the surface of Earth, and contain a large portion of Earth's biodiversity, much of it still unknown. Further, we know more about the surface of the Moon and Mars than we know about the floor of the world's oceans. To remedy this knowledge deficit, the Census of Marine Life programme was initiated to catalogue and study the distribution, diversity and abundance of life in the oceans. The census revealed how diverse, surprising, still vastly unknown, and tenacious life is in the oceans. In this disturbing and fascinating video, oceanographer Paul Snelgrove shares some of the results of this ten-year project. Professor Snelgrove, who compiled the data collected by this decade long marine census into a book, tells how shifting baselines have obscured our view of the loss that oceans have suffered as a result of human over-exploitation and shows us some of the amazing tools used to investigate oceanic habitats. So far, more than 6,000 potential new species have been discovered, so Dr Snelgrove shares photographs of a few of his favourite newly discovered species: Visit TEDtalksDirector's YouTube channel [video link].

Olga Romanova, for instance, the journalist wife of businessman Alexei Kozlov, has started an entire movement dedicated to prisoners' rights. Kozlov was jailed in 2008, and although his conviction was overturned, the Moscow city court system is busy trying to imprison him again, for fear of losing face \u2013 nobody wants to admit that there are Moscow judges who take bribes in exchange for convicting people who become \"inconvenient\" for their business partners. Romanova continues fighting on \u2013 only on behalf of her husband, but on behalf of thousands of victims of Russia's Kafka-esque court system. Also, TV personality and child of privilege Ksenia Sobchak publicly took a stand against the government this year, too. Sobchak's case is interesting, because Vladimir Putin is a friend of her family. Some have criticised Sobchak as a vile traitor, others as a little girl who's playing at being a revolutionary \u2013 but through her interviews a bold, contradictory, and deeply intelligent woman shines through. Sobchak's new political talk show, Gosdep (referencing the Russian shorthand for the US Department of State, which has been accused by loyalists of trying to stage a revolution in Russia), was recently canned by MTV \u2013 but may be reborn on the popular Snob.ru portal, which is owned by billionaire former presidential candidate Mikhail Prokhorov. Irina Yasina is someone you may not have heard of: an economist and author who has gone public about living with multiple sclerosis. Her new book, a short memoir about her illness, was published in Znamya magazine last year to wide acclaim. Reading it, I was immediately struck by the fact that Yasina's husband abandoned her shortly after she was diagnosed at the age of 35 \u2013 and struck by how she struggled to rediscover her femininity as the illness \"killed the woman inside [her]\".

And yet the biggest advance for Norwegian women this year was about giving more money to men. In April 2011 the government announced that the paid maternity leave period reserved for dads was to be increased from 10 to 12 weeks. The maternity leave in Norway is long: 10 months on full wages, or a year on 80%. Women usually take most of this, but over the last 20 years, as the state has slowly increased the leave, it has reserved a bigger and bigger part of it for men. The statistics show that fathers take their allocation, but seldom more. Some might say this is because men don't like to be with their children, but it's probably more because women are still expected to stay at home with their children while men are not. The \"dad leave\" is about changing the expectations for men and their employers. In January this year, Statistic Norway released their survey about how Norwegians use their time. This survey has been performed every 10 years since the early 70s. The last survey showed that we use less and less time on household work, while the amount of time used on care (playing with children, helping relatives etc) is the same as in the early 70s. Women making their way in the world of work has not made Norway a colder society, just a little more dusty and dirty. And an important reason for this is that fathers have more than doubled the time they spend with their children over the last 40 years. Of course, a designated dad's leave shouldn't be necessary. In an ideal world, every family should be left to decide for themselves how much they each want to use of the maternity leave. But just as women's quotas at boardroom level are necessary to make boards consider their female worker's competence, dad's leave might be necessary to give the men a chance to show what they're good for. If women are to get the chance to share the power and money in work life, it's equally necessary that the work (and fun) at home is more equally shared. \u2022 To comment on this article please visit our interactive map of what can be celebrated around the world this International Women's Day",

Even strolling down the street, the great majority of men are in white ankle-length shirt dresses while women are, by law, required to wear a black abaya and head scarf wherever they go in public. And gender differences in rights and obligations are just as black and white as the dress code. Women are banned from driving their own cars; they are not allowed to run their own businesses; they are not allowed inside main government buildings; and they cannot travel abroad, no matter what their age, without official permission from their guardians, which has to be authorised by the government. As bleak as it may seem, since last year's International Women's Day there have been numerous breakthroughs. The women's driving campaign gained international recognition and the women involved were not as severely punished, as those who drove in the 1990 campaign. Then, 47 women were suspended from their jobs for two years, some had their homes ransacked. This year, Manal al-Sharif served 10 days in prison and Shaima Jastaniah was sentenced to 10 lashes across the back. The only woman to lose her job for driving was Madeeha al-Ajroush, who, ironically, worked for a charity whose mission is women's empowerment. The rest of the women got off with pledges and warnings. Quite a few respected religious scholars, such as Shiekh Eissa al-Ghaith, also came out in support of lifting the ban. In September there was more good news with a royal decree that women would be included in the all-appointed advisory council (shura) and allowed full participation in municipal elections, whereas before they weren't even allowed to vote. Many major universities across the kingdom also opened colleges or announced plans for colleges in fields that were previously largely unavailable to women, such as law and engineering. Before 2011, all lingerie shops were manned by men and customers had to discuss their knicker and bra sizes with these men. Fortunately, as a result of several campaigns both by officials such as the past labour minister Ghazi Algosaibi and activists such as Reem Asaad, the biggest implemented change this year is that women are now allowed to work in malls as sales clerks in lingerie shops. It might seem minor, but this opens the door to hundreds of thousands of women to work in an open, non-segregated environment. It could very much have the same impact as western women joining the workforce when men went out to fight in the second world war. \u2022 To comment on this article please visit our interactive map of what can be celebrated around the world this International Women's Day",

      "bodyText": "It was in 2005 when the cover of Time magazine featured Mona Lisa in veils, it was then when I had an urge to think, write and research more about women, Islam and the media. The illustration of a European woman veiled crystallised stereotypical understandings and perceptions not only of a religion, but also a religion's relationship with women. The analysis of this cover image became my first international conference paper and an article for Feminist Theology Journal, which linked this image to the issues around cultural identity, politics, religion and feminism in the context of Turkey. The same year Eylem Kaftan's thought-provoking documentary Vendetta Song was released. It is a significant film that invites analysis of its exploration of \"honour\" killings, gender inequalities, the practice of arranged marriages and the semi-feudal social structure in Eastern Turkey. The film made me think about how religious values are significant factors in what determines cultural practices and customs. So I started asking the question of what can be said about the nature of the relationship between religion, tradition and the way women are represented in film? Skip to May 2011, the School of Film and Television Studies at the University of East Anglia funded me to visit Women Make Movies in New York. During my visit I saw fascinating documentaries by, for and about women, which explored issues around Islam in the east and the west, including They Call Me Muslim, about different perceptions on veiling in Iran and in France; Love, Honour and Disobey, about domestic violence and Muslim women in the UK and Unveiled Views, which questions whether Muslim women need saving, or whether they are in fact already independent. Looking at the notebook I had taken with me to this trip now, I see how I had already planned the weekly structure of my new module Women, Islam and Media. In fact, for the current position I hold at UEA I had to give a presentation during the interview, on what module I would set up as a final year option for a degree in Film and Television Studies. Women, Islam and Global Media was my answer. The module has already proven to be a fascinating teaching, learning and thinking experience both for me and the students of the module. Considering a variety of examples from a variety of national media texts and contexts enables a thought-provoking discussion environment. It presents opportunities and challenges simultaneously. In the first session of Women, Islam and Media I asked students to draw me a picture of a Muslim woman by giving me some keywords. The picture that emerged was of oppressed women, in veils, in a black dress. Dark and silent were recurring words and there was nothing with any positive connotations. This is precisely the task of the module: to understand where this image in our minds come from and how this is related to the media and, more importantly, why? Researching, teaching and discussing the complex relationship between media images, women and religion is a challenging task which requires a subtle approach. To address this challenge and complexity, my aim is to make teaching this topic meaningful, and go beyond the superficial, while being critical and investigative. Some of the topics have a highly emotive nature; for example \"honour\" crimes and the way they are represented in the media (both in the east and in the west) has the potential to be divisive, and may intensify sensitivities. As far as my teaching style and philosophy is concerned, it is crucial to create a conducive space for students where they can have meaningful academic conversations in a critical manner about challenging and controversial issues. Because it aims to create a space for thorough analysis, the module does not have any lectures, rather it is based on three-hour seminar discussions (and film screenings), during which we examine a range of examples and discuss different aspects of women and Islam in a variety of media from around the world. The module encourages students to conduct independent research and to analyse media texts from a critical point of view. The module creates an academic, social and political space where a variety of examples are discussed by a wonderfully enthusiastic group of students who come from all over the world (UK, US, China, Bangladesh, Mexico, France and Turkey) and with different levels of engagement with religion. The module not only gives me the opportunity to share the outcomes of my research on the area, but also I am privileged to hear a range of views from students.

      "bodyText": "This last year has been a particularly exciting one for feminism in the United States. Women's issues are on the radar like never before, and though we've suffered setbacks, the backlash against sexism is hitting fever pitch. The old-school sexism that's come up during the Republican primary race \u2013 be it the Rick Santorum funder who told women to put \"aspirin between their knees\" in lieu of birth control or Rush Limbaugh calling a woman who testified about the cost of contraception a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute\" \u2013 has actually been a boon for women's rights activists. While it's certainly depressing to know that these kinds of antiquated views of women still exist (though feminists have long known that they do), the blatant misogyny demonstrated by conservative and Republican leaders and their allies has been too egregious to ignore. And thanks to committed and passionate online feminists, the attacks on women are being answered with resounding force. When the breast cancer foundation Komen cut their funding to Planned Parenthood \u2013 for cancer screenings for low-income women \u2013 the incredible anger online prompted the organisation to restore funding within days, and a high-level executive there to resign. After Virginia legislators tried to pass a bill that would force women seeking abortions to undergo a mandated transvaginal ultrasound (an invasive procedure that would force women to be penetrated against their will), feminists launched online campaigns calling it \"state rape\". Once Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show took aim at the legislation, it was amended to exclude that particular kind of ultrasound. Feminists are still trying to get the bill killed altogether \u2013 just last week over 30 peaceful activists in Virginia were arrested by police in full riot gear. And now, Rush Limbaugh is in danger of losing most of his advertisers thanks to the quick action of feminists online and off.

Yet one thing to celebrate is that China is emerging as the leader for women in business. According to September's issue of the monthly magazine, the Hurun Report \u2013 which is best known for its rich list \u2013 seven out of the world's top 10 wealthiest self-made female billionaires are Chinese. The richest is Wu Yajun, executive director of Longfor Properties Co, south-west China, who has a net worth of 42 billion yuan (\u00a34.2bn), and had overtaken talkshow queen Oprah Winfrey (the eighth richest). Of the five wealthiest women, four, Wu included, have made their fortune through China's booming real estate market.

In China, 70% of women work \u2013 which is among the highest female employment in the world. Moreover, working mothers have the support of grandparents or cheap childcare. Yet despite the impressive achievements, Chinese female entrepreneurs lag behind their male counterparts.

It's true that in 1949, when Mao's Chinese Communists, took power, women were granted equal rights and opportunities. Yet some old habits die hard and the business world remains male-centred. Yet for women, the most pressing problems include participation in politics, which seriously lags behind other countries. Only 21.4% of the representatives in our parliament, the National People's Congress, are women, which is short of the 30% of female political participation set in 1995 by the UN, and a woman's promotion in the government too often still depends on her male bosses \u2013 who tend to give women subservient roles.

Today we should be celebrating the women's rights campaigners in Sudan who have been steadfast in their struggles against the regime's constant repression. Unfortunately the only achievement was for women in South Sudan, which became a new country this year. The women there can celebrate the achievement of the country's committing itself to international conventions of women's rights. But we should also celebrate the courage of the women of the Nuba mountains, who are being forced to hide their children in caves, and live as though they are in the stone age to avoid the government's air bombing, in its continued conflict with the rebels. Sadly, it is not only women in conflict zones who are victims in Sudan. The so-called sharia laws allow women to be lashed by whips made from rhinoceros hides. These are doled out for reasons such as dancing in mixed company. Yet Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the war crimes tribunal himself dances with women \u2013 but the sharia law he implemented is not used on him. Sudan's maternal mortality rate is still the highest in the world, and female genital mutilation continues, while judges punish rapists with less severe penalties than those handed to women for the \"crime\" of wearing trousers. Sex education for young people is considered a call for adultery \u2013 but clerics are happy to hand out fatwas imported from Iran, and other countries that allow \"weekend\" marriages. Unmarried women whose partners disappear have no rights, and their babies are abandoned in the streets of Khartoum to be eaten by stray dogs. It's true that there are a number of female ministers in Sudan, and a number of women in parliament, but this is a cosmetic exercise to hide the true face of the regime. Women have also been asked to donate their gold to support the jihad, and promised paradise in the afterlife to help the government with the cost of the war since they split with the south and the loss of oil there. While the wives of government officials stash their jewels in bank accounts in London. \u2022 To comment on this article please visit our interactive map of what can be celebrated around the world this International Women's Day",

      "body": "<p>Congratulations to women and women's rights supporters everywhere on this International Women's Day! Today we should be celebrating the women's rights campaigners in Sudan who have been steadfast in their struggles against the regime's <a href=\"http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/-/2558/1094398/-/ojtxh0z/-/index.html\" title=\"\">constant repression</a>. Unfortunately the only achievement was for women in South Sudan, which became a new country this year. The women there can celebrate the achievement of the country's committing itself to international conventions of women's rights.</p> <p>But we should also celebrate the courage of the women of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/03/nuba-mountains-scars-sudan-war\" title=\"\">Nuba mountains</a>, who are being forced to hide their children in caves, and live as though they are in the stone age to avoid the government's air bombing, in its continued conflict with the rebels.</p> <p>Sadly, it is not only women in conflict zones who are victims in Sudan. The so-called sharia laws allow women to be lashed by whips made from rhinoceros hides. These are doled out for reasons such as dancing in mixed company. Yet Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the war crimes tribunal himself <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7926813.stm\" title=\"\">dances with women</a> \u2013 but the sharia law he implemented is not used on him.</p> <p>Sudan's maternal mortality rate is still the highest in the world, and female genital mutilation continues, while judges punish rapists with less severe penalties than those handed to women for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/04/sudan-woman-trousers-trial\" title=\"\">\"crime\" of wearing trousers</a>.</p> <p>Sex education for young people is considered a call for adultery \u2013 but clerics are happy to hand out fatwas imported from Iran, and other countries that allow <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_mut%E2%80%98ah\" title=\"\">\"weekend\" marriages</a>. Unmarried women whose partners disappear have no rights, and their babies are abandoned in the streets of Khartoum to be eaten by stray dogs.</p> <p>It's true that there are a number of female ministers in Sudan, and a number of women in parliament, but this is a cosmetic exercise to hide the true face of the regime. Women have also been asked to donate their gold to support the jihad, and promised paradise in the afterlife to help the government with the cost of the war since they split with the south and the loss of oil there. While the wives of government officials stash their jewels in bank accounts in London.</p> <p>\u2022 To comment on this article please visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/interactive/2012/mar/08/celebrate-international-womens-day\" title=\"\">our interactive map of what can be celebrated around the world</a> this International Women's Day</p>",

The new parental leave law came in last October and is regarded by the current government as the biggest achievement for women's rights in recent years. And it is important. But maternity rights are not the only ones that matter and we can only wait to see how this new law will affect female employment. Chile has one of the lowest percentages of female presence in the labour market in Latin America: while the average of the continent is 53%, in Chile it is only 42%. And this new law may be a new barrier. Then there is the quality of jobs on offer. Women earn 35.4% less than men in the same position, despite a law to prohibit this. One more achievement of the past year was Congress discussing the possibility of allowing therapeutic abortion. Chile is one of the six countries in the world that does not allow abortion in any scenario, and this discussion is as far as we have gone in more than 20 years. At least it was a beginning. This debate may have gone ahead faster if there were more women involved, but only 13.9% of members of our Congress are female. As this is an election year, to celebrate International Women's Day Chileans will demonstrate to raise awareness of that low presence of women in politics and its effects. We still have a long way to go regarding women's rights in Chile, but the good news is that we are more aware about this reality than ever and are taking an active role to make the necessary changes happen. \u2022 To comment on this article please visit our interactive map of what can be celebrated around the world this International Women's Day",

      "bodyText": "The iconic big red bus is many people's view of what a bus is all about. It is seen all over the world on sightseeing work, often claiming descent from London. But is that claim based on fact? London buses have usually been red, except in surrounding country area which favoured green, as with the famous Greenline coaches. And after the initial franchising of routes in the 1980s they were all sorts until Red Ken made them red again. The capital was surrounded by fleets most of which were green, so a big green bus is pretty much as representative. But it is that iconic red bus that has captured the imagination and is the image to be found worldwide. I was pursued across the United States by some of my former buses on sightseeing duties in Hollywood and Washington DC, in red, last year and they were very definitely green with us. Many former UK buses used on such work in the guise of London buses across the world have never been near the capital, such is the impact. Indeed, two genuine ex-London buses exported to Kansas City in 1968 had spent their entire time in the capital in green, moved onto the famous Leeds operator, Samuel Ledgard, where they were blue, gaining red for the first time for export. As we had a breakfast bagel and coffee at a deli in San Francisco waiting for the Golden Gate Transit bus to Sausalito, a picture of a big red London bus on Westminster Bridge gazed down upon us. Red is actually more of a Northern colour. In the old days, parts of Merseyside had green Crosville buses, Corporation fleets in Bury, Salford, Liverpool and Blackpool also favoured green, Rochdale, Leigh and Barrow rather liked blue and Newcastle yellow. But most places affected a huge variety of shades of red. Perhaps king amongst them all was the mighty Ribble, based in Preston but covering most of the North West from the Mersey to the Solway. At its peak it employed 7,500 folk, ran 1,200 buses and carried 216 million passengers. Its Annual Balls were the largest events in the Blackpool Winter Gardens and, whether you were based in Bootle, Bowness on Solway, Kirkoswald or Clitheroe, you were made to feel part of the Ribble family.

The individualism, the civic pride, the localism of buses was swept away long ago, and the first villains were the Passenger Transport Executives in big conurbations from around 1969 onwards. They still exist, at our expense, despite the reason for their existence being long gone following local Government changes. Just what are Metro in West Yorkshire, Centro in the West Midlands and Nexus in the North East anyway? But they still persist in the inflation of their own egos with the notion that all buses in their irrelevant areas should carry their pointless and drab images. Have they learned nothing? And in an orgy of self justification, they want central bureaucratic control over local bus timetables, heaven help us all if they succeed. Thankfully, our local bus heritage is kept alive by dedicated bands of enthusiasts. Ribble's image is polished by a great fleet of preserved red buses cared for by the Ribble Vehicle Preservation Trust. Last year they organised a wonderful, nostalgic running day in Morecambe and this year they are doing it again on Sunday 6 May. Go along if you can and see what we miss today. If Morecambe's a bit far for a day, stay in the stunning art deco Midland Hotel, an experience in itself, and you'll be at the centre of the bus action.

But bird lovers hoping to see the ruddy duck in a natural habitat should hurry because the government is about to spend a further \u00a3200,000 trying to shoot the last 100 in an attempt to finally exterminate the invasive species. The cull, which started in 1999 after Spanish conservationists complained that birds originating in Britain threatened the survival of their own rare white-headed ducks by interbreeding with them, has so far killed around 6,500 at a cost of over \u00a35m, making the ruddy duck, at around \u00a3900 each, some of the most expensive ducks in the world. According to Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), fewer than 100 remain, after a culling of 2,689 ducks between September 2005 and January 2007. But bird lovers have questioned the practicality and sense in continuing with the cull of the birds whose only crime, it has been said, is to be \"American, over-sexed and over here\". Last year, some European countries with ruddy duck populations gave up trying to kill all their birds for both financial and logistical reasons. \"The cull cannot succeed now. There are hundreds of ruddy ducks on the continent which will not be killed so the birds will continue to breed. There's never been any proof, anyway, that the British population has ever interbred with the Spanish ducks,\" said Lee Evans, founder of the British Birding Association. Calling for the cull to be abandoned, Evans challenged the government figures: \"The government says there are only around 100 left in Britain, which justifies their continuing with the killing, but I know of 197 birds. I'm not saying where they all are but there's no way they will be able to eradicate them all.\" Attempts to exterminate the ducks as a breeding British bird were first made in the 1990s, but got off to a bad start when the wildfowlers employed to shoot them on their nests during the breeding season refused to do so because it was \"unsporting\". By June 2000, Defra had spent \u00a3840,000 but killed only a few hundred of the 7,000 then thought to be resident in Britain. Since then, the culling programme has been expanded to many countries in Europe with the help of EU money. The last British cull finished last year but, says Defra in a letter, is now being continued. \"Defra is continuing to fund ongoing work this year of \u00a3200,000 to enable the food and environment research agency to carry out eradication,\" said a spokeswoman in an email. But attempts to kill the birds have become increasingly \"obsessional\" and expensive say observers. For the past five years, teams of seven marksmen have been employed to go out in boats to kill the birds across Britain. \"They spend \u00a37,000 on each cull. They keep diving to escape but the shooters circle the birds, get them more and more exhausted and then kill them. They really are sitting ducks,\" said one gamekeeper who wished to remain anonymous. The bird's origin in Europe goes back to 1948 when the conservationist and bird painter Sir Peter Scott introduced three pairs from the US to his Slimbridge reserve in Gloucestershire. The population grew rapidly and some escaped leading to a healthy British population of many thousand by the 1980s. But the ruddy ducks also made their way to mainland Europe and found a niche in Spain where the first hybrids white headed ducks were seen in around 1990. According to Fera, the government agency which conducts the culls each year, a total of 322 adult and immature ruddy ducks were shot on 39 sites between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2011. \"Shooting of ruddy ducks has now taken place on 128 sites across Scotland, England and Wales since 2005,\" says the agency on its website. A spokesman for the RSPB, which is favour of the culling of the ruddy duck, said: \"The white headed duck is one of the most endangered in Europe and the threat to it from the ruddy duck remains. We need to get to a position where there is no longer a threat. Otherwise, in 20 years' time we could risk being in the same situation because we failed to see it through to the best conclusion.\"",

      "bodyText": "If there is one thing the divided and fragmented political forces in Egypt could agree upon when designing the law for the most recent elections, it was to remove the quota for women. Islamists, youth revolutionary coalitions and political parties disagreed on virtually everything, but when it came to the quota that set aside 64 seats for women in the 500-plus seat parliament, they agreed it must go. The parliament's quota system, which was introduced by former president Hosni Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, had been used by an authoritarian regime to bring into office women from the ruling party. In Egypt's quota-less parliament today, there are eight women out of 508 MPs \u2013 less than 2%, and down from the previous 12%. It is ironic that when the quota was announced in June 2009 it was hailed by the international community as a hallmark of the country moving closer to democracy, and yet in post-Mubarak Egypt it was rejected as a symbol of authoritarian rule. Quotas do increase numbers in most cases, but they don't work very well as proxies for democratisation or gender justice. And when used by authoritarian regimes, they become tainted. This presents us with a policy conundrum: affirmative action has been lauded by progressive politicians, feminists and development bodies as a way to empower women politically. There is no reason to drop affirmative action, but there is a need to go beyond reducing women's political empowerment to the number of women in office. If we are serious about promoting gender justice, we must turn political empowerment upside down. Our starting point should be to better understand how women get involved in politics. For a start, it means broadening our understanding of politics to go beyond the nomination for office in legislatures, so that we are able to recognise those women who also engage politically in formal and informal capacities. Research undertaken by the Pathways of Women's Empowerment (pdf) in four continents shows that quotas are not a magic bullet. Their transformative potential is often contingent not only on getting the technicalities right (such as how the system sanctions parties that fail to have women high up on their party lists) but understanding the power configurations in a particular context and how it is likely to influence the political landscape. For example, in some cases, it may be more conducive to promoting gender justice by being highly selective about which women are supported. Proxy women for political parties with highly reactionary political agendas are hardly going to advocate for gender justice when in office. Another key message emanating from the Pathways' research is of a major disconnect between how women build up political power in reality and how political empowerment programmes work. Political empowerment programmes' focus on individual women's capabilities, such as on how to run a campaign or speak in public, provide them with useful skills. But this highly individualistic approach is missing out on many opportunities to make a difference by recognising that political bargaining power and weight is built through alliances, networks and coalitions. Hence, it is important to examine practical ways of supporting this embedded nature of doing politics by working with allies and coalitions, as well as, where relevant, women's families and networks. The key to enhancing women's political empowerment is the role of building a constituency. Working in neighbourhoods is important for outreach, but so is gaining visibility through television. It means that policies to support women's political empowerment should not only target the women who announce they will run for office, but also have expanding political apprenticeship opportunities for a wide pool of women so that they can build the constituency they need to claim legitimacy. Research findings from case studies in Asia, Africa and Latin America suggest that where women have organised collectively under the banner of promoting gender equality, they have played important roles in influencing the design of electoral laws and in holding the state, political parties and others (such as the media) accountable for their gender-biased policies and practices. In post-Mubarak Egypt, women have been subjected to a backlash so the space for contestation is highly inhibited. But one can't help wondering whether if we had in Egypt a strong women's movement championing gender justice, would women have been able to use their political clout to influence the electoral law and hold accountable the state and political parties for the outcome? At the very least, they would have made it far more difficult for the powers-that-be to get away with blocking women's political leadership. \u2022 Mariz Tadros is co-editor with Analice Costa of Quotas: Add Women and Stir?",

This presents us with a policy conundrum: affirmative action has been lauded by progressive politicians, feminists and development bodies as a way to empower women politically. There is no reason to drop affirmative action, but there is a need to go beyond reducing women's political empowerment to the number of women in office.</p> <p>If we are serious about promoting gender justice, we must turn political empowerment upside down. Our starting point should be to better understand how women get involved in politics. For a start, it means broadening our understanding of politics to go beyond the nomination for office in legislatures, so that we are able to recognise those women who also engage politically in formal and informal capacities.</p> <p>Research undertaken by the <a href=\"http://www.pathwaysofempowerment.org/Women_and_Politics_Policy_Paper.pdf\" title=\"\">Pathways of Women's Empowerment</a> (pdf) in four continents shows that quotas are not a magic bullet. Their transformative potential is often contingent not only on getting the technicalities right (such as how the system sanctions parties that fail to have women high up on their party lists) but understanding the power configurations in a particular context and how it is likely to influence the political landscape.</p> <p>For example, in some cases, it may be more conducive to promoting gender justice by being highly selective about which women are supported. Proxy women for political parties with highly reactionary political agendas are hardly going to advocate for gender justice when in office.</p> <p>Another key message emanating from the Pathways' research is of a major disconnect between how women build up political power in reality and how political empowerment programmes work. Political empowerment programmes' focus on individual women's capabilities, such as on how to run a campaign or speak in public, provide them with useful skills. But this highly individualistic approach is missing out on many opportunities to make a difference by recognising that political bargaining power and weight is built through alliances, networks and coalitions. Hence, it is important to examine practical ways of supporting this embedded nature of doing politics by working with allies and coalitions, as well as, where relevant, women's families and networks.</p> <p>The key to enhancing women's political empowerment is the role of building a constituency. Working in neighbourhoods is important for outreach, but so is gaining visibility through television. It means that policies to support women's political empowerment should not only target the women who announce they will run for office, but also have expanding political apprenticeship opportunities for a wide pool of women so that they can build the constituency they need to claim legitimacy.</p> <p>Research findings from case studies in Asia, Africa and Latin America suggest that where women have organised collectively under the banner of promoting gender equality, they have played important roles in influencing the design of electoral laws and in holding the state, political parties and others (such as the media) accountable for their gender-biased policies and practices.</p> <p>In post-Mubarak Egypt, women have been subjected to a backlash so the space for contestation is highly inhibited. But one can't help wondering whether if we had in Egypt a strong women's movement championing gender justice, would women have been able to use their political clout to influence the electoral law and hold accountable the state and political parties for the outcome? At the very least, they would have made it far more difficult for the powers-that-be to get away with blocking women's political leadership.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Mariz Tadros is co-editor with Analice Costa of </em><a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/idspublication/quotas-add-women-and-stir\" title=\"\"><em>Quotas: Add Women and Stir?</em></a><em> </em></p>",

      "bodyText": "As the new tax year rolls in, charities that operate overseas should be wary of a new burden lurking around the corner. From April, the government's tax on all passengers flying from the UK will rise by double the rate of inflation. In the chancellor's Autumn statement it was announced that air passenger duty (APD) would increase by 8% in a government bid to generate \u00a33.5bn from the levy by 2015/16. This will have a devastating effect on charities, particularly those who are carrying out important humanitarian aid and disaster relief work overseas. That's why I'm calling for a review of the tax for the voluntary sector. A charity worker travelling economy class on a long haul flight to tackle the famine in East Africa last year had to pay \u00a375 in APD when flying from the UK \u2013 up from \u00a320 in 2007. This is now set to rise further. Key Travel charity clients paid \u00a33.2m in APD last year. One large humanitarian charity had to find in excess of \u00a380,000 just to cover the tax during the period. No one needs reminding what a voluntary organisation could do with such money but, for the sake of illustration, with \u00a380,000 a humanitarian charity could provide a lasting supply of clean water for nearly 5,500 children or fit 3,200 African homes with solar panels. APD, an excise duty, was originally levied as a 'green tax' to curb how much we fly \u2013 the premise being that if flights are made more expensive, consumer demand will fall. Some environmental organisations have been quick to rally against the airline industry which has been lobbying government to scrap it. This stand-off, though predictable, is not particularly helpful in furthering our understanding of APD and its effects. Air passenger duty, in my opinion, is inadequate as a green tax. The proceeds are not ringfenced for green initiatives but rather absorbed into the general tax pool. The Treasury openly admits it is a valued revenue stream for tackling the deficit inherited from the previous government. And with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) now in effect, airlines will pay when they exceed their carbon ration and the proceeds earmarked for green investment, the environmental case for the duty is weak. If the only merit of APD as a 'green tax' is that it acts as a deterrent, then it should not in principle apply to the voluntary sector. Charity workers cannot and should not be deterred from flying to the aid of the world's poorest. Those who work in the third sector have a duty to monitor and reduce their carbon emissions, just as much as those who work in the public and private sectors. But would the money from APD not be better spent by charities themselves on offsetting their carbon emissions or directly helping those on the frontline of climate change, poverty and disaster? The additional rise could mean cuts in charity aid. This seems to me an 'own goal' for a government that boasts its international aid programme. It is imperative that the government provides some kind of relief for charities, or even better, an exemption.

      "bodyText": "The government's claim that the rise of new global powers and shifts in the centres of economic activity will in no way reduce Britain's influence in the world is wholly unrealistic, according to a withering report by senior MPs and peers. It says oversight by the National Security Council, which includes the heads of MI5 and MI6, is \"not sufficiently broad and strategic\", and sharply criticises ministers for withholding information to avoid proper parliamentary scrutiny. The report, released on Thursday by the joint parliamentary committee on the national security strategy, describes as extraordinary the failure of the council to discuss the implications of the collapse of the eurozone or the possibility of Scottish independence. The criticism is all the more significant since the committee includes a number of former ministers and the former head of MI5, Lady Manningham-Buller. The National Security Council does not appear to have carried out a proper assessment of the extent to which Britain can rely on its allies in future conflicts, says the report. The MPs and peers make clear they are worried that the US is turning its back on Europe to concentrate on defending its interests in Asia. \"We call on the government to reflect deeply on the long-term implications of the geographical and functional shifts in US policy that are now taking place. It raises fundamental questions if our pre-eminent defence and security relationship is with an ally who has interests which are increasingly divergent from our own,\" the report warns. It adds: \"The government needs to decide if the UK will continue to be as involved in US military action as we have been in the past if the US focuses on Asia-Pacific. If the US is moving towards viewing Europe as a producer rather than a consumer of security \u2026 it raises more questions as to what we can expect from the US and what the US expects from the UK.\" The committee says it is unacceptable to be told by the prime minister's new national security adviser, Sir Kim Darroch, that it cannot see a paper from the National Security Council's risk assessment. \"It is not that we particularly wish to see a cabinet committee paper, but we cannot judge if the priority risks are the right ones without more detailed information about how they were arrived at,\" the parliamentary committee says. It continues: \"We fully accept that some parts of [the paper], particularly those relating to terrorism and hostile countries, are sensitive and must remain classified.\" But passages covering \"pandemic flu, accidents, flooding, and severe space weather, for example \u2013 could probably be published\". The report adds: \"The government's national security strategy simultaneously recognises the rise of new global powers, shifts in the centres of economic activity, and reduced resources in the UK, while at the same time asserting 'no reduction in influence'. This is wholly unrealistic in the medium to long term and the UK needs to plan for a changing, and more partnership-dependent, role in the world.\" Chair of the committee, Margaret Beckett MP, said: \"A good strategy is realistic, is clear on the big questions, and guides choices. This one does not. We need a public debate on the sort of country we want the UK to be in future and whether our ambitions are realistic, given how much we are prepared to spend.\"",

      "bodyText": "Azores One thousand miles west of Lisbon, surrounded by the deep waters of the Atlantic, the Azores archipelago feels like the edge of the world, its lush landscape virtually untouched. The beaches are black sand so may put off some sun worshippers but if you are after somewhere different, the dramatic scenery makes a beautiful backdrop to various activities including whale and dilphin watching and walking or simply enjoying the islands' sleepy charm. Sunvil's (020-8758 4722, sunvil.co.uk) seven-night holiday departs 7 April, staying at the family-friendly Hotel do Colegio in the historic centre of Ponta Delgada on the island of San Miguel, costs from \u00a3596pp B&amp;B, including flights from Gatwick and transfers. Portugal If the four-hour flight to the Azores is too off putting, stick to mainland Portugal. Muxima is an eco-retreat set in a eucalyptus forest but close to some of the best beaches on the Algarve. Run by a couple who previously worked in Africa on aid projects, this is a homely and child-friendly retreat with plenty to keep kids entertained, whether they are learning to surf, playing with the free range pigs, or swimming in the onsite pool. Stay for a week between 1 April and 9 April and receive a \u20ac10 discount per day on your stay, so a family sharing a junior suite would pay \u20ac130 a night if booked through i-escape.com. Cycling in the French Alps Cycling is a great family option \u2013 the potential for bickering is greatly reduced when the kids are distracted by the scenery \u2013 and it knackers them out. Velo Vercors, a small, specialist cycling company run by British couple Roger Dunne (an ex cycle pro) and Teresa Harte in the Vercors national park in the Alps, has put together a family package for this Easter, staying in a gite with private terrace, barbecue and shared garden in the village of St Jean-en-Royans. They have mapped out a selection of child-friendly day trips along flatter, quieter routes, most incorporating an activity such as a river boat ride which stops an interactive garden (jardin-des-fontaines.com), and plenty of cafe stops along the way. \u2022 The trip costs \u00a3900 with Velo Vercors (+33 4 7571 3550, velovercors.com) for a family of four sharing, and includes seven nights' self-catering, bike and helmet hire, mapped family-friendly cycle routes and a home-cooked, seasonal evening meal on the day of arrival. Available from 31 March-28 April. To get there take the TGV to Valence TGV, then a 30 minute taxi-ride. Or fly to Grenoble from Stansted with Ryanair (40 minutes by car) Spain Small rural hotel and active children do not always go well together, but La Casa del Puente in eastern Cantabria (01223 328721, casas.co.uk) is well set up for families. As well as standard rooms it has six suites which sleep up to five and three apartments with kitchens (sleeping up to nine). There's a good restaurant and a play area for children. But the big draw is the surrounding scenery. The hotel is set in the Valle de Soba, an area as spectacular as the Picos de Europa but almost completely untouched by tourism. With dramatic mountain scenery on your doorstep this trip would suit a family with older children who want to make the most of the landscape. The hotel can organise excursions on foot or by bike along marked trails through the Collados del As\u00f3n nature park, which contains more than 4,000 caves \u2013 you can see cave paintings at the prehistoric caves of Cullavera and Covalanas near Ramales de La Victoria are worth a visit. If you're lucky with the weather (they don't call this area Espana Verde for nothing \u2013 it can rain a lot here), the beaches of Laredo or Santona are a half-hour drive away. Or for a city fix, Santander or Bilbao are an hour away. \u2022 Five nights at Easter would come to \u00a3670 including breakfast, for a family of four in a suite. Fly to Bilbao or Santander Sicily Relais Torre Marabino offers the best of both worlds for parents: it's a simple but elegant hotel where you can self-cater. Converted from an old grain store, there are seven rooms including suites with kitchenettes that sleep up to five people, a pool and a small kids' play area. A 15-mile drive takes you to the Vendicari nature reserve, a five-mile-long expanse of wild fields, lagoons and marshland stretching to the sea, dotted all the way with wild flowers. And the pretty Baroque towns of Noto and Modica, renowned for its chocolate \u2013 an Aztec-inspired, milk-free kind that comes in all kinds of flavours from meat to mint \u2013 are also each less than 15 miles away. Ice-cream, sunshine, beaches and chocolate \u2013 the ingredients for a successful family holiday. Importantly, this trip includes flights which, if booked separately, can rack up the cost of a holiday at Easter. \u2022 Departing 31 March, Real Holidays (020-7359 3938, realholidays.co.uk) has a week's self-catering across two double rooms from \u00a3784pp including BA flights to Catania and car hire (four sharing) Tuscany Self-catering in Tuscany in the school holidays can be a pricey option but Invitation to Tuscany, a family-run business which has hand-picked all 200 of its properties, is offering an idyllic cottage just outside Siena from \u00a3561 for the week (based on four sharing). Campalfi is a cluster of three cottages converted from a group of ancient farm buildings with a pretty garden and a safe swimming river 200 metres away. The English-speaking owner is a great chef and serves meals every Saturday night and on alternate evenings (\u20ac25pp including wine) should you fancy a night off cooking duties. The smallest apartment, sleeping four, costs \u00a3561 for the week beginning 7 April, another sleeping four is \u00a3613 and the largest, sleeping five, is \u00a3665. \u2022 020-8444 9500, invitationtotuscany.com Lincolnshire So many self-catering properties take the safe option when it comes to decor \u2013 all beiges and grey minimalism \u2013 that it's refreshing to come across somewhere as loud as Priory House, which is owned by a sculptor and a fashion designer. The rooms won't be to everyone's taste but if you have a penchant for exotic kitsch, you'll love it. The sofas are covered in animal print fabrics, stag heads decorate the walls and the dining room is a vision of sugary pink with gold chandeliers. It is set in 1\u00bd acres of private grounds (the garden is the perfect spot for an Easter egg hunt) on the edge of the village of Long Bennington, only a mile from the A1, making is easily accessible from London or the north. \u2022 Sleeps eight (in four bedrooms) from \u00a31,210 per week over Easter through holidaylettings.co.uk Cumbria The Lake District will be heaving this Easter \u2013 as it is during every major holiday. So avoid the crowds and head east into the Eden Valley, a much less well known but absolutely beautiful part of Cumbria. Farmers Steve and Paula Roberts branched out into glamping last year, with two yurts and a gypsy caravan on their 12-acre small holding. This year they have added a wooden cook house with two mini kitchens, one for each yurt. Children will love joining Steve on his rounds feeding chickens and rare breed pigs. Parents will enjoy chilling by the Eden river which runs along the edge of their land. A hamper of the farm's own sausages, bacon and eggs and homemade bread and jams means you're sorted for breakfast on your first day. You can also buy the farm's produce to cook onsite. There's no shortage of things to do: Armathwaite station on the Carlisle-Settle line is a 20-minute walk away; from here you can take a short ride to the ancient border city of Carlisle, or take the train into the upper Eden Valley and explore the market towns of Appleby and Kirkby Stephen. \u2022 Drybeck Farm (07854 523012, drybeckfarm.co.uk). A long weekend (Friday-Monday) costs from \u00a3180 for the gypsy caravan (sleeps two) to \u00a3330 for the larger yurt, which sleeps a maximum of eight (at a squeeze), or \u00a3350-\u00a3595 respectively for the week Wales The name Mudtrek may not scream brilliant family holiday, but actually, this mountain biking holiday has all the ingredients for a successful trip (mud notwithstanding). Lots of fresh air, someone else doing all the planning and cooking, and spacious, luxurious but cosy base to retreat to after a hard day's cycling. Styling themselves as a ski chalet for mountain bikers, Mudtrek offers fully catered stays in a converted barn in rural Llanllwni, Carmarthenshire. Nikki, your \"chalet girl\" will set you up for the day with a big breakfast and a generous packed lunch while her husband Jason, a qualified MIAS guide will guide you along the Brechfa trails. After a day out on the trails, you'll return to tea and chocolate cake, followed later by a three-course meal. \u2022 01267 202423, mudtrek.com. Three nights, fully catered over Easter from 6 April now costs \u00a3275pp (discounted from \u00a3325). Bike hire can be arranged for an extra charge for those not able to bring their own bikes Suffolk Are you a foodie family? Food Safari is a Suffolk-based company offering courses in butchery, bread-making, foraging, and visits to local smokehouses and oyster beds. New for this year is its Children's Food Safari, where kids become mini butchers for the day, boning and mincing pork to make sausages \u2013 which they put through the sausage machine and tie themselves. The reward for your hard work? You get to sit down together tuck into the freshest sausages you've probably ever eaten, with salad leaves picked straight from the garden and bread rolls, also made earlier. The following day (15 April) Food Safari is hosting the Suffolk Gran Calcotadamini, a gathering in the style of Spanish village festival with a barbecue at the barn. The company also has a selection of recommended places to stay on its website, including nearby Alde Garden, a small campsite with a yurt, gypsy caravan and cottage sleeping four which has plenty of availability the second week of Easter. \u2022 01728 621380, foodsafari.co.uk.

      "bodyText": "Blame Sir Peter Scott. Forty-five years ago this late friend of royalty, nature and art galleries went duck-hunting not with a shotgun but with a chequebook. Scott of the Antarctic's son was building up Slimbridge into one of the world's first major bird sanctuaries, and wildfowl were Sir Peter's passion. If a bird had webbed feet, he wanted it - to draw, to study, to protect, harbour and nurture. Included on the shopping list for this great avian experiment that immediately captured the public's imagination and helped make Sir Peter as well-known as his father was Oxyura jamaicensis, the north American ruddy duck. This small, reddish-brown bird, an assertive member of a group known as 'stifftails', delights in sticking its tail in the air and metaphorically sticking a finger up the nose of anyone who wants to control it. Biologists note that the ruddy duck frequents freshwater marshes in the breeding season, moving to coastal areas with sheltered brackish or salt water in the winter. Common as muck in parts of Canada and the United States, it is genetically very similar to Oxyura leucocephala, the white-headed duck which is found mainly in southern Russia, Turkey and Azerbaijan. Sir Peter wanted exotic birds and had three pairs of ruddies sent over from a collector in Salt Lake City, Utah. They were, recalls an old Slimbridge man, a ruddy problem from the start. For reasons that made sense at the time, Sir Peter's chaps used chickens to incubate the eggs and brood the young birds. They hatched well but within 24 hours the ruddy ducklings had rejected their 'nurses' and, to the consternation of the chickens, headed straight for water. The parents were given custody and for a short while mothers, fathers and offspring ducked and dived in the Slimbridge pools blissfully unaw are that they would eventually stimulate one of the potentially great rows of European nature conservation involving the European Community, 10 nationalities, a lot of pride, priggishness and passion, the legal system of several countries and millions of pounds' expense. Some ducks are relatively tranquil. Not the ruddy duck. One of its characteristics is its rapid diving every few seconds for invertebrae. The Slimbridge ducklings proved impossible to catch, with the result that some of them never had their wings pinioned or clipped. Within a few months a number had flown Sir Peter's nest and established themselves in nearby lakes, reservoirs and old gravel workings. No one particularly minded. Bird-watchers relished the chance to see them in the wild, Sir Peter and his acolytes had a world-famous trust to run, the conservation movement and its philosophies had hardly been formed and no other animals were, it was thought, particularly inconvenienced. The ruddy duck found an unopposed niche in the British countryside and prospered. By any reckoning, the duck done good. For 40 years it fanned out all over Britain. To Anglesey, to Scotland, to reservoirs and lakes. Within a few years of its accidental release from Slimbridge, the British bird establishment had welcomed and legally protected it. Over the years, it has become a favourite with bird-lovers who give it strikingly human - and British - characteristics: 'it's bonny', they say they chuckle because it's 'randy', 'macho', 'unruly', 'plucky', 'precocious', 'strong-gened', 'cute' and 'secretive'. In no time at all, it has acquired a fan club and become an adopted British bird. An estimated 3,500 have now established themselves in Britain. Others, it is assumed from the same Slimbridge stock, have made it over to Norway, Belgium, Holland and Germany, where it is prized in collections. Meanwhile in Spain the ruddy duck's first cousin, the white-headed duck, symbol of Andalucia but greatly loved in the homeland of Lorca, sherry and flamenco for its flesh, was threatened. Developers, farmers and hunters had all but wiped out the breed. By 1977, numbers were down to 22. While there was a healthy population of about 19,000 in Russia and Kazakhstan, the western European branch of Oxyura leucocephala, was genetically cut off interbreeding among ever-declining numbers was leading to weaker genes and inevitable extinction. Stung by continual, withering criticisms from north European countries that the Spanish were more interested in pursuing economic growth at all costs and made lousy conservationists, and conscious that 'their' duck was considered a genetic weakling, Andalucia and later the Spanish government poured \u00a32 million into last-ditch programmes to protect their flower of duckhood. By 1991, the number of white-headed ducks had recovered to more than 760. Spanish conservationists cocked a hoop and the world hailed a tentative conservation victory. And then in 1991, Icona, the Spanish government's conservation agency, found a bird outside Cadiz that was neither exactly ruddy nor white-headed. Photographs were sent to Slimbridge and the truth, which some British ornithologists had long suspected but had ignored, dawned. Not to put too fine a point on it, the (British) ruddy duck was accused of having acted like a lager lout on his Spanish holiday, aggressively elbowing aside the weak Spanish white-headed males and having his way with the senoritas. More research suggested that up to a dozen hybrids had been born. Sir Peter's ducks had come to roost. There was consternation. Conservationists are mostly wedded to preserving diversity in nature, to protecting the weak, to keeping nature as it is today and increasingly to returning it to how it might have been. They know that every animal has adapted itself or been changed by circumstance since neolithic times, that nature abhors the weakest, that thousands of animals and plants have been introduced by man into every country. But conservationists have formed their own rules. Nature, for most of them, is disappearing and also becoming homogenised. One way to stop this is to eradicate birds, plants and animals which threaten to take over other species. They are wrapped up in the heritage debate and the more fundamental among them have considered cutting down sycamores, shooting every pheasant and rabbit, killing every grey squirrel, eradicating the rhododendron and other species introduced into Britain. Purity would be returning chalk downland to forest and reintroducing the wolf, the beaver and the wild boar. In fact, the vast majority of conservationists are pragmatists who accept this sort of behaviour would be totally unsocial and argue that a line must be drawn. The consensus among professionals is that the second world war is the most convenient, if arbitrary, place. But the ruddy duck had broken the cardinal rule of conservation and been caught interbreeding with its threatened cousin. The implications were clear: the species would inevitably move eastward and, rather like American culture, sweep across Asia. Nothing, it was said, would stop it eventually destroying the great redoubt of the white-headed duck in Kazakhstan. As importantly, the ruddy duck was on shaky political ground. The Spanish, vying, it is said, for European conservation superiority and exhibiting a newly discovered ecological purity, went to the EC. The EC, known for paying only lip service to protecting habitats but good at issuing directives that most countries promptly ignore, demanded action. Conservationists from 10 countries were summoned to Britain. A communique was issued: the ruddy duck was to be ethnically cleansed from all of Europe. In the animal kingdom, the price of illicit fornication can be high. The ruddy duck has a year or so's grace. Humane 'methods', conservationists agreed, should be tested. The British, who are most involved because most ruddy ducks in Europe live here, have set up the ruddy duck working group (now dubbed the 'ruddy duck extermination committee') to find out if it is possible to kill them all. Chaired by the Government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee, it includes members of every major bird group in Britain - the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, the International Council for Bird Preservation, the International Wetlands Research Bureau. The Department of the Environment, English Nature, the Scottish and Welsh government agencies and others have chimed in behind them. This week, backed by a \u00a375,000 government grant, this confederacy of bird-lovers gave the go-ahead for 'tests' on Anglesey and even now two men from Sir Peter Scott's Wildlife and Wetlands Trust are shooting the birds and pouring paraffin over their eggs to stop them hatching. They will report back on their experiments and, if the Government agrees that it is feasible to eradicate all ruddy ducks , the law will be changed to take it off the protected list, allowing every hunter in Britain to kill them. If the full programme is sanctioned, as the conservationists would like, it will cost millions of pounds. No one in the establishment, rather authoritarian conservation world will publicly defend the ruddy duck. Nor will animal welfare groups go on the record to support its cause, being more concerned with the methods of killing than the thinking behind the war against the ruddy duck. Privately, everyone regrets that the duck must be killed, but bird group members who largely pay for the professional conservationists have not been consulted. Nevertheless, a passionate correspondence mainly against the ruddy duck is building. 'The moral onus,' says Andy Peterson of Torremolinos in this month's Birdwatch magazine, 'rests with the British authorities to do something. The ruddy duck must go to preserve our own species.' James Cracknell of Suffolk says: 'If this was the robin that faced competition from an introduced species...I am sure many people would be calling for the extermination of its competitor.' 'Have we not done the same to the coypu and muskrat?' asks Mr Bowman of Norfolk. 'Do we raise a hair at the thought of eradicating rats and cats from seabird islands?' Indeed. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which is not represented on the ruddy duck working group, and this week has all but admitted defeat in its long fight to save the panda, agrees that conservation is stacked with inconsistencies and value judgments. Chris Tydeman, senior UK policy officer, says: 'The scientific basis is that we have reached a moment in time where we say that enough is enough and people want to keep species as they are, as opposed to letting them progress to something else. Conservation has only been an agreed concept since the war...Thinking is moving on and is not necessarily set in aspic.' Only a few professionals will put their heads above the parapet. John Wyatt, author and ornithologist, questions the statistics: 'We have only circumstantial evidence that ruddy ducks from Britain impregnated the white-headed duck,' he says. 'We have no idea how many are going over there each year. But is it our problem or a Spanish one? Are the offending ducks from Britain or from collections in Europe, even Spain itself? We should not be controlling our population unless we feel it's got too great. Surely it's easier to control the situation from Spain. We are being told to cull our 3,500 ruddy ducks not because they are damaging the environment but because fewer than a dozen hybrid birds have been found. Everyone's in a flap.' The Wildlife and Wetlands Trust agrees that it is only circumstantial evidence linking the British birds with the hybrids. 'There are no ring recoveries, and we can't say categorically that it is birds from Britain. But there are fairly strong indications from bird counts that this is happening. Sensibly, some come from Britain.' Paul Evans, chair of the British Association of Nature Conservationists, speaking as an individual, says that history is not on the side of the conservationists: 'When people want to obliterate a species it never works,' he says. 'They've tried to kill off stray dogs but they always survive, reproducing quicker than ever. It's a losing battle. 'The ruddy duck is a problem created by conservationists for conservationists. What we're seeing is good old Cartesian science and reductionism rearing their heads again. Conservation is largely species-centred. The professionals look at species as sacred, sacrosanct. Science still sees nature as a collection of separate things, united by causal laws and decrees that all the bits must be maintained. The reality is that nature is in a constant state of flux. Conservationists feel they have to do something about it, protect nature, manage it. They've found a scapegoat in the ruddy duck and are actually just diverting attention away from the real issues of massive environmental degradation.' The philosopher Mary Midgley urges a note of caution. 'This is linked with the heritage problem, the idea that everything must be preserved. Extreme reaction is probably foolish. People have to get used to the fact that creatures move around the world. War on a species seems doomed.' Evans and other post-modern conservationists argue that you cannot ring-fence nature any more than take the utilitarian line of politicians that nature is a resource only for people. The idea of stewardship is dead, they say. Rather, man should be seen as a part of nature and conservation should be a way of negotiating with the natural world. But who will negotiate for the ruddy duck?",

      "bodyText": "It was billed as \"Occupy Rogers Centre\" by the expectant Toronto fans. More than 45,000 tickets were sold for tonight's quarter final first leg visit of LA Galaxy - and hopes ran high that a retooled Toronto defense could make an inspiring stand against LA's one percenters. The MLS champions found themselves 2-0 down after just 17 minutes but in the end it wasn't to be for the Canadians. Despite all the celebrated attacking options LA has, the injury to Omar Gonzalez has created a real headache at center back for Bruce Arena. Tonight's temporary solution, Andrew Boyens, looked out of place in the early stages of the game - his timing and positioning out of sync with his new team mates. Whilst his midfield prodded balls over the top of the Toronto defense at one end, he found himself being repeatedly challenged early on for pace by Joao Plata at the other. After ten minutes, one such Plata dart ended in Franklin smothering a potentially dangerous cross in the box. From the resulting corner, a pressured Todd Dunivant saw his attempted headed clearance ping to Ryan Johnson on the edge of the six yard box. Ryan Johnson's reaction volley slammed past the helpless Saunders and Toronto had the lead. Seven minutes later it was two. Frings, whose organizational effectiveness in a deep-lying role has to be offset against the loss of momentum Toronto endure when he isn't playing further forward, found himself in an unusually advanced wide position. His cross into the box was to a dangerous area, but should have been headed clear by Boyens, who was disastrously out of position. Instead the young draftee Luis Silva found himself in acres of space by the penalty spot, and he lofted a precise header past Saunders into the corner. This was as good as it got for Toronto, as they looked to press forward at speed, taking the calculated risk that LA were somewhat telegraphing their punches by constantly looking for the long ball over the top. Not that those punches aren't dangerous. A Beckham corner threatened to dip and swerve straight past Frei just after Toronto's second - prompting a frantic save and a mini-sequence of repeated probing corners from the English midfielder. Beckham's corners were one of the subplots of the night. The Toronto fans had created a festive atmosphere in Rogers Centre, but this was a party where the clean up started during the festivities. At every Beckham corner he would find himself wading through industrial quantities of red and white streamers, which he would step round with stoic concentration as more flew in past the hapless stewards. The cross for the Galaxy's first goal didn't come from Beckham, but from Donovan. With Toronto content to drop a little deeper with their lead, their front three were not keeping the Galaxy quite as honest. Just before the half hour mark LA managed a sustained period of final third pressure and their breakthrough came. Donovan found himself at the byline and Frei could only deflect his cross into the path of Magee, who had drifted in to the back post. The away goal changed the complexion of the tie. Toronto had never previously conceded more than a single goal at home in CCL play, but even one goal was more than they could comfortably take to Los Angeles next week. LA are notably miserly at the Home Depot Center and would have fancied their chances of recovering from a one goal deficit there. As it happened they didn't need to. Toronto seemed to lose belief as the game went on and when Aron Winter removed Plata in the 58th minute, their attack began to look blunt. Immediately Keane almost scored when a long throw sent him clear, but his final touch, or the bounce of the artificial pitch, let him down. Galaxy were still not managing many fluid attacks, but apart from a couple of half chances for Silva and Koevermans, Toronto were not looking like the home side. That said, they looked like holding on to their narrow lead until the final minutes, with the indefatigable Frings throwing himself everywhere in defense. And with the amount of debris he was attracting, Beckham had been speeding up his corner kick rituals through the second half - limiting their effectiveness. But in the 88th minute he slowed down again for a final attempt, whilst Arena threw on a double substitution of Stephens and Barrett. As the barrage renewed, a beer can was thrown on the pitch, which the midfielder ostentatiously removed, before floating a precise cross into the heart of the Toronto box. Frei couldn't reach it, the ball was turned back in and the unmarked Donovan slotted home at close range. Toronto FC: Frei, Harden, Aceval, Eckersley, Morgan, Frings, Dunfield (Stinson), Silva, Koevermans, Johnson, Plata (Thompson-Lambe) Los Angeles Galaxy: Saunders, Dunivant, Franklin, Boyens (Barrett), DeLaGarza, Beckham, Juninho (Stephens), Donovan, Keane, Magee, Buddle Seattle Sounders 2-1 Santos Laguna (Estrada 12', Evans 63') (G\u00f3mez 61') CenturyLink Field, Seattle Seattle got off to a perfect start in the 12th minute of their Champions League Quarter-final when Freddy Montero dropped deep to float a pinpoint cross to the back post, where it was met by the surging David Estrada for a headed goal. The Seattle fans were in good voice - delivering their trademark call-and-response rallying cry as their side pressed forward. Montero went close with a short range header that was clawed clear by the Santos keeper, S\u00e1nchez - and while Santos Laguna threatened at times and Gspurning had to be alert, Seattle were reasonable value for their lead at the half. Seattle, wearing an eye-catching (if not eye-injuring...) Cyan and Yellow uniform, continued to harry early in the second half, with Montero consistently lively. Santos were beginning to gain control of the midfield though, as the more game-ready team exerted pressure on the American side (who at the start of this game had yet to kick a ball in anger in 2012). Seattle always had potential on the break though - early in the half Estrada outstripped S\u00e1nchez to a loose ball in the corner, but with the keeper stranded he couldn't find anyone with his cross. Santos Laguna's midfield had been consistently lofting passes in to test the Seattle center backs, without looking particularly threatening. On the hour former Seattle player Hercules Gomez made a diagonal dart to the near post to meet yet another chip and turn it under Gspurning for the vital away goal. Barely two minutes later Seattle had their lead back: a beautifully delivered Mauro Rosales free kick was met by a firm Brad Evans header at the six yard line, that flew past the stranded S\u00e1nchez. In the wake of their goal, Seattle were resurgent - sensing a third goal might be necessary to counter the damage of the away goal. In this phase of the game their possession play and familiar overlaps were at their most effective and Santos Laguna found themselves on the back foot once more. With 13 minutes left and Seattle pressing, a huge roar went up, as the crowd got their first glimpse of Eddie Johnson, on for Fern\u00e1ndez. Much will hinge on his form this season, but there was no fairy tale re-introduction to the American game tonight. As both sides tired, the game fizzled out and Seattle will travel to Mexico with the slenderest of leads.

      "body": "<p>It was billed as \"Occupy Rogers Centre\" by the expectant Toronto fans. More than 45,000 tickets were sold for tonight's quarter final first leg visit of LA Galaxy - and hopes ran high that a retooled Toronto defense could make an inspiring stand against LA's one percenters. The MLS champions found themselves 2-0 down after just 17 minutes but in the end it wasn't to be for the Canadians.</p> <p>Despite all the celebrated attacking options LA has, the injury to Omar Gonzalez has created a real headache at center back for Bruce Arena. Tonight's temporary solution, Andrew Boyens, looked out of place in the early stages of the game - his timing and positioning out of sync with his new team mates. Whilst his midfield prodded balls over the top of the Toronto defense at one end, he found himself being repeatedly challenged early on for pace by Joao Plata at the other. </p> <p>After ten minutes, one such Plata dart ended in Franklin smothering a potentially dangerous cross in the box. From the resulting corner, a pressured Todd Dunivant saw his attempted headed clearance ping to Ryan Johnson on the edge of the six yard box. Ryan Johnson's reaction volley slammed past the helpless Saunders and Toronto had the lead. </p> <p>Seven minutes later it was two. Frings, whose organizational effectiveness in a deep-lying role has to be offset against the loss of momentum Toronto endure when he isn't playing further forward, found himself in an unusually advanced wide position. His cross into the box was to a dangerous area, but should have been headed clear by Boyens, who was disastrously out of position. Instead the young draftee Luis Silva found himself in acres of space by the penalty spot, and he lofted a precise header past Saunders into the corner.</p> <p>This was as good as it got for Toronto, as they looked to press forward at speed, taking the calculated risk that LA were somewhat telegraphing their punches by constantly looking for the long ball over the top. Not that those punches aren't dangerous. A Beckham corner threatened to dip and swerve straight past Frei just after Toronto's second - prompting a frantic save and a mini-sequence of repeated probing corners from the English midfielder.</p> <p>Beckham's corners were one of the subplots of the night. The Toronto fans had created a festive atmosphere in Rogers Centre, but this was a party where the clean up started during the festivities. At every Beckham corner he would find himself wading through industrial quantities of red and white streamers, which he would step round with stoic concentration as more flew in past the hapless stewards. </p> <p>The cross for the Galaxy's first goal didn't come from Beckham, but from Donovan. With Toronto content to drop a little deeper with their lead, their front three were not keeping the Galaxy quite as honest. Just before the half hour mark LA managed a sustained period of final third pressure and their breakthrough came. Donovan found himself at the byline and Frei could only deflect his cross into the path of Magee, who had drifted in to the back post. </p> <p>The away goal changed the complexion of the tie. Toronto had never previously conceded more than a single goal at home in CCL play, but even one goal was more than they could comfortably take to Los Angeles next week. LA are notably miserly at the Home Depot Center and would have fancied their chances of recovering from a one goal deficit there. </p> <p>As it happened they didn't need to. Toronto seemed to lose belief as the game went on and when Aron Winter removed Plata in the 58th minute, their attack began to look blunt. Immediately Keane almost scored when a long throw sent him clear, but his final touch, or the bounce of the artificial pitch, let him down. Galaxy were still not managing many fluid attacks, but apart from a couple of half chances for Silva and Koevermans, Toronto were not looking like the home side.</p> <p>That said, they looked like holding on to their narrow lead until the final minutes, with the indefatigable Frings throwing himself everywhere in defense. And with the amount of debris he was attracting, Beckham had been speeding up his corner kick rituals through the second half - limiting their effectiveness. But in the 88th minute he slowed down again for a final attempt, whilst Arena threw on a double substitution of Stephens and Barrett. As the barrage renewed, a beer can was thrown on the pitch, which the midfielder ostentatiously removed, before floating a precise cross into the heart of the Toronto box. Frei couldn't reach it, the ball was turned back in and the unmarked Donovan slotted home at close range.</p> <p>Toronto FC: Frei, Harden, Aceval, Eckersley, Morgan, Frings, Dunfield (Stinson), Silva, Koevermans, Johnson, Plata (Thompson-Lambe)</p> <p>Los Angeles Galaxy: Saunders, Dunivant, Franklin, Boyens (Barrett), DeLaGarza, Beckham, Juninho (Stephens), Donovan, Keane, Magee, Buddle</p> <p><strong>Seattle Sounders 2-1 Santos Laguna</strong><br>(Estrada 12', Evans 63') (G\u00f3mez 61')<br>CenturyLink Field, Seattle</p> <p>Seattle got off to a perfect start in the 12th minute of their Champions League Quarter-final when Freddy Montero dropped deep to float a pinpoint cross to the back post, where it was met by the surging David Estrada for a headed goal. The Seattle fans were in good voice - delivering their trademark call-and-response rallying cry as their side pressed forward. Montero went close with a short range header that was clawed clear by the Santos keeper, S\u00e1nchez - and while Santos Laguna threatened at times and Gspurning had to be alert, Seattle were reasonable value for their lead at the half. </p> <p>Seattle, wearing an eye-catching (if not eye-injuring...)

      "bodyText": "The defiant tone was set at the start of Save our NHS rally at Westminster's central hall when the crowd gave a noisy standing ovation to June Hautot, the veteran NHS campaigner who made headlines last month when she cornered Andrew Lansley as he tried to get into Downing Street for the prime minister's NHS summit, from which most key medical organisations were excluded. It was just one of many low points the health secretary has experienced during the health and social care bill's tortuous and highly charged 14-month progress. Thousands of nurses, midwives, doctors, physiotherapists, cleaners, porters and other NHS workers were thought to have attended the rally, with marches from the headquarters of the British Medical Association near Euston and St Thomas's hospital in south London converging on Westminster. The atmosphere was optimistic; the talk was of fighting the bill \u2013 and getting it dropped. Only Andrew George MP, the most awkward of the Liberal Democrats' parliamentary awkward squad on the bill, was jeered, and that was because of the party he represents. But when the crowd was told that he had campaigned against the plans from the start, that turned to applause, though punctuated by increasingly angry cries that his party was selling out the NHS. Speaker after speaker stressed their love and admiration for the NHS and its unique place in national life. \"It's more popular than the BBC and more popular than the royal family,\" said Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison. Kailash Chand, the doctor behind the e-petition on the Downing Street website, which has gained a record 170,000 signatures, demanding the scrapping of the bill, said it was \"the finest achievement of the 20th century\". Vikki Mills, who is experiencing plenty of NHS care as she is pregnant with twins, said she had been told that her babies may be born prematurely and need special care. \"My care is based on my needs,\" she said, before warning that the coalition's plan to let NHS hospitals raise as much as 49% of their income from private patients could lead to a two-tier NHS, with some patients getting better care than others simply because they were paying for it. Then she took on Lansley's common refrain that critics of the bill oppose it because they do not understand it. \"David Cameron, Andrew Lansley, Nick Clegg, I'm against this bill because I do understand it\", Mills said, to loud applause. Nye Bevan's famous dictum that the NHS would survive for as long as there was people left to fight for it was invoked over and over again, gaining applause every time. Comedian Jo Brand, an ex-psychiatric nurse, warned that, given the potential impact of \"very, very dangerous\" plans, the service's initials may stand for Not Here Soon and the care of the most vulnerable, especially the elderly, would suffer as a result. Only Lord Owen, the crossbench peer who has been one of the bill's leading critics in the House of Lords, came close to suggesting that, with the legislation close to gaining parliamentary approval, their fight may not succeed. Initially the crowd cheered him. Do David Cameron and Nick Clegg have a mandate for introducing the bill, given the Conservative leader ruled out reorganising the NHS during the 2010 election? No, they bellowed back. \"It's a constitutional outrage that this bill should be presented in this way,\" said Owen, a former hospital doctor whose father was a GP. Its purpose, he said, \"is to commercialise and privatise healthcare\". When he apologised for the failure by him and his fellow peers to make \"any fundamental changes\" to the bill during its long scrutiny in the Lords, there were boos and cries of \"shame\". It was heresy to many, but painful reality for others. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said Labour would hold a Commons debate and vote on dropping the bill next Tuesday, adding that if he became health secretary he would repeal it. But privately even some of the speakers at the event accepted that, barring an unlikely major revolt by Liberal Democrat members at their spring conference this weekend, the NHS plans will soon pass through the Lords, and then the Commons again, and then gain the royal assent that campaigners dread. Before the rally, the BMA's consultants conference had passed a motion of no confidence in Lansley. A Department of Health spokesman said: \"The BMA's opposition to the plans on NHS reform and pensions are well-known. \"But doctors on the front line are getting on improving care for patients \u2013 across the country patients are being treated in more convenient places and pressure on hospitals is reducing.\"",

Kailash Chand, the doctor behind the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/14/nhs-health-bill-epetitions-campaign\" title=\"\">e-petition on the Downing Street website</a>, which has gained a record 170,000 signatures, demanding the scrapping of the bill, said it was \"the finest achievement of the 20th century\".</p> <p>Vikki Mills, who is experiencing plenty of NHS care as she is pregnant with twins, said she had been told that her babies may be born prematurely and need special care. \"My care is based on my needs,\" she said, before warning that the coalition's plan to let NHS hospitals raise as much as 49% of their income from private patients could lead to a two-tier NHS, with some patients getting better care than others simply because they were paying for it.</p> <p>Then she took on Lansley's common refrain that critics of the bill oppose it because they do not understand it. \"David Cameron, Andrew Lansley, Nick Clegg, I'm against this bill because I <em>do </em>understand it\", Mills said, to loud applause.</p> <p>Nye Bevan's famous dictum that the NHS would survive for as long as there was people left to fight for it was invoked over and over again, gaining applause every time.</p> <p>Comedian Jo Brand, an ex-psychiatric nurse, warned that, given the potential impact of \"very, very dangerous\" plans, the service's initials may stand for Not Here Soon and the care of the most vulnerable, especially the elderly, would suffer as a result.</p> <p>Only Lord Owen, the crossbench peer who has been one of the bill's leading critics in the House of Lords, came close to suggesting that, with the legislation close to gaining parliamentary approval, their fight may not succeed. Initially the crowd cheered him. Do David Cameron and Nick Clegg have a mandate for introducing the bill, given the Conservative leader ruled out reorganising the NHS during the 2010 election? No, they bellowed back.</p> <p>\"It's a constitutional outrage that this bill should be presented in this way,\" said Owen, a former hospital doctor whose father was a GP. Its purpose, he said, \"is to commercialise and privatise healthcare\".</p> <p>When he apologised for the failure by him and his fellow peers to make \"any fundamental changes\" to the bill during its long scrutiny in the Lords, there were boos and cries of \"shame\". It was heresy to many, but painful reality for others.</p> <p>Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said Labour would hold a Commons debate and vote on dropping the bill next Tuesday, adding that if he became health secretary he would repeal it.</p> <p>But privately even some of the speakers at the event accepted that, barring an unlikely major revolt by Liberal Democrat members at their spring conference this weekend, the NHS plans will soon pass through the Lords, and then the Commons again, and then gain the royal assent that campaigners dread.</p> <p>Before the rally, the BMA's consultants conference had passed a motion of no confidence in Lansley. A Department of Health spokesman said: \"The BMA's opposition to the plans on NHS reform and pensions are well-known.</p> <p>\"But doctors on the front line are getting on improving care for patients \u2013 across the country patients are being treated in more convenient places and pressure on hospitals is reducing.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Salacious whistles and sexist comments may fall foul of new laws against sexual harassment to which Britain is signing up, the prime minister will announce on Thursday. The pledge to criminalise \"verbal, non-verbal or physical\" sexual harassment is one of the commitments in the Council of Europe's convention on violence against women, which David Cameron will commit to signing at a special event to mark International Women's Day. Among the pledges in the convention, which has already been signed by 18 countries including Germany, France and Ukraine, is one to pass legislation or other measures to criminalise or impose other sanctions for \"unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment\". Another clause would outlaw \"psychological violence\" \u2013 defined as \"seriously impairing a person's psychological integrity through coercion or threats\", language which suggests serious bullying could be covered by new laws. Other measures Britain and other signatories would have to enshrine in law include compensation for victims of domestic violence; easy annulment or dissolution of forced marriages; and punishments for carrying out or coercing somebody into genital mutilation, forced abortions or forced sterilisation. In a separate move, Cameron is expected to back government support for new laws to criminalise stalking, with jail terms of up to five years and unlimited fines. Signing up to the European convention will be announced in a joint statement by Cameron and deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, to mark International Women's Day. \"The agreement is not just a piece of paper,\" says the statement. \"It's going to lift the standards of protection for women across Europe, give greater support for victims and \u2013 crucially \u2013 bring many more perpetrators to justice.\" Former attorney general Baroness Scotland, who worked on the convention for four years under the Labour government, said the clause on sexual harassment was not intended to cover less serious incidents such as wolf-whistling and public teasing. However, campaigners on the issue said the convention was \"what we've been trying to get for years\". Julia Gray, founder of the London branch of US movement Hollaback, dedicated to getting rid of street harassment, said: \"The way we see it is if you want to tackle it you tackle all of it \u2013 you say no to all forms of unwanted sexual harassment; that includes wolf-whistling, comments, everything.\" A Downing Street spokesman said it was too early to discuss possible sanctions for sexual harassment. Overall, the convention was largely modelled on UK laws and practices, but signing it would help protect Britain's high standards, said Scotland. \"I praise God they have finally signed it, but I'm shocked they didn't sign immediately [in 2011].\" The announcement on stalking follows a year-long campaign for reform organised by the charity Protection Against Stalking and Napo, the probation and family court union. The Conservative Lord Oliver Henley will table amendments on stalking law reform to the protection of freedoms bill in parliament. He will be followed by an official announcement from the prime minister at an evening reception to mark International Women's Day at Number 10. In a statement released (WED) on Wednesday night, Cameron said: \"Stalking is an abhorrent crime. It makes life a living hell for the victims \u2013 breaking up relationships, forcing the victims to move house, making them feel they are being watched 24 hours of the day. That is why we are explicitly criminalising stalking, to make sure that justice is done, protect the victims and show beyond doubt that stalking is a crime.\" The British Crime Survey estimated that approximately 120,000 incidents of stalking occur each year. Between 2009 and 2010, however, just 53,000 crimes of stalking or harassment were recorded by the police: 2% of which received a custodial sentence, and a further 10% of which were given a fine or a probation order. The reforms are thought to be similar to those introduced in Scotland in December 2010. Since the introduction of the stalking law in Scotland there have been over four hundred400 prosecutions compared with an average of seven per year under existing breach of the peace legislation for each of the previous 10 years.",

      "bodyText": "Historical fiction \u2013 from love among heroes in ancient Greece to bickering jazz musicians in Nazi-occupied Paris \u2013 forms a significant chunk of this year's Orange prize longlist, which has been revealed to coincide with International Women's Day. Twenty novels made the list for Britain's only annual prize for fiction written by women, including books by Emma Donoghue, Anne Enright, AL Kennedy and Ali Smith. There were five books by debut novelists and four from writers with their \"tricky\" second novel. Joanna Trollope, the chair of judges, said the breadth of subject matter was particularly striking. \"It is the diversity that really characterises this longlist,\" she said. \"Yes, there are a fair number of historical novels, but they vary hugely from a gay cabaret artist in Berlin in the second world war to a preacher going off to deal with lost souls on a Hebridean island in the 1830s.\" A total of 143 novels were submitted for the prize, many dealing with historical subjects and many set during the second world war, said Trollope. \"It is because, I think, it is just so unresolved. Writers inevitably go back to unfinished business and try and work it out somehow, so it is a very natural topic.\" Many serious subjects had been tackled, she said, which was a good thing. \"There's an extraordinarily unafraid quality in women when it comes to both emotions and writing. Fiction is a way into life's great dilemmas and it is more than justified that serious stuff gets aired in fiction \u2013 quite apart from the fact that comic fiction is unbelievably hard to write.\" The list for this year's prize, the 17th, consists of eight British writers, seven American, three Irish, one Swedish and one Canadian author. The oldest set novel is Madeline Miller's The Song of Achilles, which tells of the love between Homeric heroes Achilles and Patroclus. Miller, a teacher of Latin and ancient Greek, took 10 years to complete her first published novel. Other historical novels include Karin Altenberg's Island of Wings, set on St Kilda in the 1830s; Stella Tillyard's Tides of War, a story of love and betrayal set in Regency London during the Peninsular war; and Esi Edugyan's jazz in Nazi-occupied Paris novel, Half Blood Blues, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize last year. There will be real pleasure in seeing Smith longlisted for There but for the, a novel many felt should have been listed for last year's Booker. It tells the story of a dinner party guest who locks himself in the spare room and stays \u2013 and stays. Emma Donoghue, shortlisted for the Orange and Man Booker prizes two years ago for her international bestseller Room, is longlisted for her seventh novel, The Sealed Letter, based on a real Victorian courtroom scandal, the Codrington divorce. Anne Enright, who won the Booker in 2007 for The Gathering and will be appearing at the Guardian Book Club next week, is listed for The Forgotten Waltz, a Dublin-set story of adultery and its consequences; and AL Kennedy, who won the Costa book of the year in 2007 with Day, is listed for her sixth novel, The Blue Book, set on an Atlantic cruise ship with a dodgy spiritualist medium as one of its main characters. The five debut novelists on the list are Altenberg, Tillyard and Miller, along with Erin Morgenstern for The Night Circus, and Amy Waldman for The Submission. The 20 are completed by the City-set On The Floor, the third novel of the Irish writer Aifric Campbell, who spent 13 years working as an investment banker in London; Leah Hager Cohen's The Grief of Others; Roopa Farooki for The Flying Man; Jaimy Gordon for Lord of Misrule; Georgina Harding for Painter of Silence; Jane Harris for Gillespie and I; Francesca Kay for The Translation of the Bones; Cynthia Ozick for Foreign Bodies; Ann Patchett for State of Wonder; and Anna Stothard for The Pink Hotel. The judging panel this year also includes Lisa Appignanesi, Victoria Derbyshire, Natalie Haynes and Natasha Kaplinsky. All read around 35 books each, while Trollope read them all. \"This experience has been an absolute treat,\" said Trollope. \"It has actually been quite exhilarating because three of the judges are younger than my own children, which has brought a wonderful kind of freshness and energy not just to the meetings, but to me.\" It is Trollope's first time on the Orange jury but not her first time chairing a book prize. \"I do it because I believe so earnestly in literary prizes being the most wonderful showcase for writers and because writing, for some reason, is such an envied and sexy profession now \u2013 everyone seems to want to write a book, and it is getting harder and harder to get visibility of any kind. \"I'm very keen on assisting writers who are coming up who are finding it jolly hard to get noticed. It also keeps me in touch; it is quite energising for someone creative like me to realise just how good stuff there is out there and also how incredibly varied it is.\" The prize has been won for the last three years by American writers \u2013 T\u00e9a Obreht, Barbara Kingsolver and Marilynne Robinson. The shortlist will be announced in April before the \u00a330,000 winner is announced at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 30 May.",

      "bodyText": "The much-loved bacon sandwich needs no hagiography from me, the holy trinity of bread, salty fatty pork and piquant sauce being a bona fide national institution. Indeed, so central a part does it play in British culture that it's impossible to imagine any other dish which so reliably raises the national spirits in times of trouble \u2013 devoured by hungry builders, peckish pensioners and footsore royal wedding goers with equal enthusiasm, it's the simple pleasure which unites the country. And if you don't eat pork, I'm sorry. Trust me, if you did, you'd love bacon sandwiches just as much as the rest of us. But, as in so much of life, when passions run high, tempers can flare \u2013 the church of brown sauce stands firm against the house of ketchup and the disciples of toast are willing to take up arms against their bready brethren. Back or streaky; grilled or fried; butter, dripping or even mayo \u2013 a Britisher's buttie is his castle, and he'll defend it to the end. Personally, I always go for grilled back bacon between sourdough toast with enough English mustard to make me sneeze but ... could I be missing out? Back v streaky In Class, her seminal anthropological romp through British society, the brilliant Jilly Cooper quotes a shopkeeper on the subject of bacon: \"When a woman asks for back I call her 'madam'; when she asks for streaky I call her 'dear'.\" Lean and meaty, back bacon is clearly the premium choice \u2013 but my confidence is shaken when I read the godlike Nigel Slater prefers streaky \"because I like the fat as much as I like the lean, and I don't think anything else is right for a bacon sandwich.\" I like fat too, I think. Why have I never considered streaky worthy of my breakfast table? Jamie Oliver, as far as I can tell from the grainy black and white picture that accompanies his \"bacon sarnie my stylie\" in The Return of the Naked Chef, appears to favour back bacon. I'm torn: the fried streaky is utterly fattily delicious, but on its own it's too much of a good thing \u2013 like cheese and butter, or a piece of pork belly with more fat than meat. The back, however, is good like a curate's egg \u2013 unless folded over to ensure a piece of both fat and lean in each mouthful, it's rather dry and thus disappointing. Fellow Word of Mouther Tim Hayward, who has investigated the subject in typically forensic detail, informs me that at his Cambridge cafe, Fitzbillies, they favour a mixture of back and streaky, which is the kind of fence sitting I could really get into. (If you can get middle bacon, which is the best of both worlds, even better.) Jamie mentions thicker-cut bacon in his advice \u2013 although I agree that wafer-thin stuff is often disappointing, anything too chunky risks jeopardising the all-important crunch factor, so I'm going to stick with a standard cut. Finding a good piece of dry-cured bacon is essential \u2013 you don't want your meat to give off too much water during cooking, or it will boil in its own juices and you can wave goodbye to any hope of crispness (as one Jonny Neale helpfully advises on twitter, if you find yourself with water in the pan, remove the bacon, pat it dry, clean out the pan and add a little oil before continuing cooking). I find the stuff sliced to order at the butchers tends to be the driest, but, as with most meat, buying the best stuff you can find and afford is usually a good rule of thumb. And it goes without saying that you need smoked bacon for a sandwich \u2013 I will countenance no deviation on this point. Grilling v frying ... v griddling I generally grill my bacon, more out of habit than anything else \u2013 it makes sense for a fry-up, where there's no room in the pan for bacon, and I've adopted the same policy even if it's the only thing I'm cooking. But, although I love the slightly charred dryness of grilled bacon, it strikes me that all the lovely fat which provides so much flavour is going to waste at the bottom of the grill pan, which seems a shame, especially when the back has so little of the stuff to start with. Ever the maverick, Jamie Oliver eschews both the grill and the frying pan. \"If you fancy yourself as a bit of a tiger\" the young and still Naked Chef writes, \"then acquire a ridged griddle pan\" to cook your bacon in. I do indeed fancy myself as a tiger \u2013 especially if this smoky, charred stuff is what those noble creatures eat for tea. The flavour is happily reminiscent of barbecued bacon rolls the morning after a big summer party \u2013 crisp, but not greasy. Bread The other important component in a bacon sandwich is, of course, the sandwich itself ie bread. There seems to be rare consensus that it must be white (\"unless you need your roughage\" Jamie adds), and for once, I agree: much as I love the nuttiness of brown bread, it's too assertive for this dish: the bread needs to be a vehicle for the bacon, not its co-star. Nigel Slater reckons that somehow a bacon sandwich is \"better with factory-made 'plastic bread'\", a claim echoed by many on Twitter. Although I have a nostalgic fondness for cheap white sliced bread, following a four slice a day toast habit at school, I can't agree here; it's pappy and squidgy and glues itself to the top of my mouth. The horror. Out of curiosity, however, I also try something called a \"milk roll\", after Tim discloses that, after months of experimentation, Fitzbillies settled on a \"custom-baked soft milk roll: floury top, long oval shape to take rashers ... \". This stuff is just like slightly sweet, oddly circular cotton wool though, and even worse than the more normally-shaped plastic bread \u2013 too late I discover that the Fitzbillies' version is more of a soft bap, with a shot of milk in the dough. \"Structural integrity is important\" Tim informs me \u2013 and this has none of it. Clearly, I need to give the roll a try instead. White and floury, and oddly difficult to find anywhere but the kind of bakers that specialises in large, coconut-encrusted jam cakes, I'm in unknown bacon sarnie territory here \u2013 but it's a risk that pays off. Unlike my usual robust sourdough, which takes more chewing than the meat itself, the fluffiness of a bap is a lovely contrast to the crispness of the bacon while, as Tim observed, standing up sturdily to the weight of fillings and sauces. I'm not too happy with the flavour, or lack thereof, in the ones from the local bakers though, so I decide to make my own, based on a recipe from Elizabeth David's English Bread and Yeast Cookery: as a concession to the rich savouriness of the bacon, I've replaced some of the milk in the dough with water, cut the salt, and added a little brown sugar instead. Toasting The bread question doesn't stop once the variety has been determined: there's also the matter of its preparation to address. I like a bit of crunch to my bread, which rules out leaving it in its natural state. But toasting both sides, as is my wont, makes things problematically crisp \u2013 you need a lot of tea to wash down a toasted bacon sandwich. Toasting one side, as fiercely recommended by many tweeters, is better, allowing the softer side to soak up some of the ambrosial bacon grease, but this is hard to achieve with a roll, where one side of each slice is covered in a soft crust. Nigel suggests frying the bread briefly in the bacon fat before assembling the sandwich, which is a nice trick, but even better is Jamie's idea of charring it on the griddle \u2013 it picks up a little fat, a little crunch, and a lot of flavour, adding to the whole barbecue effect. I also try adding a little sugar to the pan to caramelise the bread lightly, as Dinan Gunawardena suggests on Twitter, but it smacks too much of French toast, a dish which made me violently sick aged 11 and has never since passed my lips. Extras I'm going to keep my opinions firmly to myself when it comes to ketchup or brown sauce (mostly because I prefer mustard and marmalade myself, and I think I'm on my own there), but the array of weird and wonderful toppings suggested on twitter deserve to be shared here. From @LadyVelo's maple syrup (which is actually pretty good \u2013 with a dollop of mustard, naturally) to @Helen_Barlett's mango chutney and smoked salmon, via salad cream, bananas and even smoked cheese, toppings really do seem to be very... individual. I'm with Tim on the liberal buttering of the bread though \u2013 the creamy blandness of sweet unsalted butter is an excellent foil to the bacon. Come on \u2013 if you're in need of the welcoming embrace of a bacon sandwich, a little extra fat is the least of your problems. Perfect bacon sandwiches For the rolls (makes 6): 450g plain white flour, plus extra for dusting 1 tsp salt \u00bd tsp brown sugar 100ml milk, plus extra for glazing 200ml water 2 tsp dried yeast 2 rashers dry-cured smoked streaky bacon per person 1 rasher dry-cured smoked back bacon per person Unsalted butter 1. Sift the flour, salt and sugar into a large mixing bowl. Combine the milk and water and heat until tepid, then stir in the yeast. Mix this quickly into the dry ingredients until you have a fairly soft dough, adding a little more milk or water if necessary. Cover and put in a warm place for 1\u00bd hours until well risen. 2. Preheat the oven to 220C. Divide the dough into 6 pieces and shape each into an oval (to fit the bacon), then space out on a floured baking tray, cover and leave for 15 minutes. 3. Brush the tops of the rolls with milk, sprinkle with flour, and poke a small indentation in the top of each one. Bake for 15\u201320 minutes until pale gold. 4. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat for about 4 minutes, then add the bacon (depending on how many you're catering for, you may need to do this in batches, in which case have the oven on low so you can keep the cooked bacon warm until it's all ready). Cook, without moving, until the fat begins to turn golden, then turn over. Once it's cooked to your satisfaction, move to the edge of the pan. 5. Split each roll in two (the rougher the cut, the crisper the toasted side will be) and toast under the grill on the cut side for about 30 seconds until lightly charred. Butter, stuff with 2 rashers of streaky and 1 rasher of back bacon per person, and serve immediately. Is the humble bacon sandwich the nation's favourite dish \u2013 and can anything top it as a hangover cure? (What do vegetarians and other pork avoiders turn to after a hard night?) And why on earth would anyone soil them with ketchup or brown sauce?",

Sift the flour, salt and sugar into a large mixing bowl. Combine the milk and water and heat until tepid, then stir in the yeast. Mix this quickly into the dry ingredients until you have a fairly soft dough, adding a little more milk or water if necessary. Cover and put in a warm place for 1\u00bd hours until well risen.</p> <p>2. Preheat the oven to 220C. Divide the dough into 6 pieces and shape each into an oval (to fit the bacon), then space out on a floured baking tray, cover and leave for 15 minutes.</p> <p>3. Brush the tops of the rolls with milk, sprinkle with flour, and poke a small indentation in the top of each one. Bake for 15\u201320 minutes until pale gold.</p> <p>4. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat for about 4 minutes, then add the bacon (depending on how many you're catering for, you may need to do this in batches, in which case have the oven on low so you can keep the cooked bacon warm until it's all ready). Cook, without moving, until the fat begins to turn golden, then turn over. Once it's cooked to your satisfaction, move to the edge of the pan. </p> <p>5. Split each roll in two (the rougher the cut, the crisper the toasted side will be) and toast under the grill on the cut side for about 30 seconds until lightly charred. Butter, stuff with 2 rashers of streaky and 1 rasher of back bacon per person, and serve immediately.</p> <p>Is the humble bacon sandwich the nation's favourite dish \u2013 and can anything top it as a hangover cure? (What do vegetarians and other pork avoiders turn to after a hard night?) And why on earth would anyone soil them with ketchup or brown sauce?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Roberto Mancini has admitted Manchester City would be interested in signing Robin van Persie in the summer but believes Arsenal will convince him to sign a new contract or the London club will have a \"big problem\". The Dutch forward will have only a year remaining on his present deal at the Emirates at the close of the season and, asked if he thought the 28-year-old will stay at the club, Mancini said: \"I think Robin van Persie will sign a new contract at Arsenal. Because if Arsenal also lose Van Persie, they will have a big problem. We are interested in all good players. This is normal, but not only us. All the good teams are interested in Van Persie.\" Mancini was clear about his qualities. \"I think Van Persie at this moment is one of the best strikers in Europe with [Lionel] Messi, [Cristiano] Ronaldo and with Sergio [Ag\u00fcero] and Mario [Balotelli]. He is a fantastic striker, but I think he will remain with Arsenal.\" Mancini was asked why, given Arsenal's struggles this season and City's status as league leaders, Van Persie would choose to remain at the north London club. \"Because Arsenal in the summer, I think they will buy good players,\" the manager said. \"Because Arsenal is a top team. They want to win the next Premier League.\" Due to his contract status Van Persie is a rare example of a top line striker who is available relatively cheaply this close season. \"But I don't think he will be cheap because he has one year left on his contract,\" Mancini said. Pressed that rather, say, costing \u00a360m he might be prised away for around \u00a330m the manager added: \"This is normal because if, for example, you wanted to buy [Edinson] Cavani [of Napoli], he would [cost] maybe \u00a330m. He [Van Persie] is Arsenal's best player at the moment and it is difficult for them to give him to another club.\" Mancini did state that City's previously difficult relations with Arsenal, caused by the deals that have taken Ga\u00ebl Clichy, Samir Nasri, Kolo Tour\u00e9 and Emmanuel Adebayor to the club, would not stop them trying to sign Van Persie if there were a possibility to do so. \"If there is a good player who wants to leave a club, then we are interested. But if this player wants to stay, we don't have any problem. But in my opinion Van Persie will stay at Arsenal,\" Mancini said. The manager confirmed that Balotelli has been fined one week's salary for breaking a curfew at a strip club the day before Saturday's 2-0 win over Bolton Wanderers and has accepted this. He added that Carlos Tevez still \"needs another maybe two games in the next two weeks\" before he may be available. City lead United by two points and Mancini believes this margin gives his team some breathing space in the race against Sir Alex Ferguson's side. \"We have two points more, for us it is different. I think we have 11 games and we need to win eight,\" he said. \"Now we have one month where we will play every three days and we need to be very, very strong.\" The Italian's team take on Sporting Lisbon in the last-16 first leg of the Europa League at the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade and he said: \"It will be a very difficult game. We are playing a very good team. We will need to play some players because afterwards we play in three days. For this reason, because we play a lot of games, we need to change some players.\" Pablo Zabaleta has travelled but is a doubt with a hamstring injury while Yaya Tour\u00e9 is suspended. Mancini confirmed that Sergio Ag\u00fcero will start and the Argentinian, who has made an excellent start to his career City scoring 21 times since joining in the summer, said: \"I think this is only the beginning for me at Manchester City.\"",

      "bodyText": "New teachers will be invited to become specialists in managing disruptive behaviour following a review commissioned by the government in the wake of last summer's riots. From September, new recruits to the profession will be able to do part of their teacher training in pupil referral units, where children excluded from mainstream education are taught. The recommendation is contained in a report by the government's adviser on behaviour, Charlie Taylor, who said such training would be a \"fantastic grounding\" for any teacher. Two-thirds of the young people brought before the courts after last summer's riots had some form of special educational need and more than one in 10 had been permanently excluded from school. Taylor said: \"One of the things these children find difficult to deal with, and it's ironic because they have chaotic lives, is any sort of change. So less churn in the staff of pupil referral units, a bit more stability, is the key \u2013 specialists, and better trained specialists.\" Teachers with this training could inject expertise into mainstream schools, Taylor said. \"Often it takes an expert to go in and say: 'You know what? The way you react to the child is feeding their behaviour.'\" At present, pupil referral units are not allowed to run work-based teacher training, and teachers cannot complete their qualified teacher status or spend their induction year as a newly qualified teacher in one of the units. Taylor said outstanding pupil referral units should be encouraged to convert to academy status and operate independently from their local authority. He argued this would give them greater freedom to develop a wider range of services. He said children excluded from mainstream education had historically been neglected by the school system. In 2010, just over 1% of pupils in \"alternative provision\" achieved five good GCSE passes including English and maths, compared with over 53% in all schools in England. Taylor said: \"One of the things is that these children are incredibly irritating. They can make us feel really angry, when you walk down the street and there are four of them blocking the pavement. It can make us want to be punitive \u2013 bring back the birch. We don't always do what we need to do for them. For many years they've been in the peripheral vision of the education world. \"Ultimately, if we don't address these children and help them, give them what they need, they'll take it from us, on their terms.\" The Department for Education is currently running a trial in which schools retain responsibility for the education of pupils they exclude. Schools continue to receive funding for these pupils and can use the money to develop bespoke programmes for individual children. The report was welcomed by the Association of School and College Leaders union, which represents headteachers. However, the union's general secretary, Brian Lightman, warned: \"We have reservations about encouraging large numbers of trainee teachers in alternative provision settings. There are instances where it would make sense, but given the challenges these pupils bring, it seems that putting young, inexperienced trainee teachers in that situation would not usually be in the best interest of the teacher or the pupils.\"",

      "bodyText": "Alex Salmond has been challenged by the Electoral Commission to test his referendum question on Scottish independence with the voters or risk accusations he is rigging the poll with a slanted question. In an unusually strong intervention, the commission said that thorough, independent scrutiny of any question in the referendum was essential to ensure it was clear, fair and neutral and to guarantee that the final result was reliable. There were signs on Wednesday night that the Scottish government was shifting ground by agreeing to allow the commission to independently try out the question on voters, suggesting it could be reworded to make it more neutral. The first minister announced in January that he wanted to put a \"straightforward and clear\" 10-word question to Scotland's 4 million voters in the autumn of 2014, asking: \"Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?\" But his preferred wording was quickly challenged by a number of senior opinion pollsters and prominent election analysts, who said it was biased in favour of a \"yes\" vote because it asked people to agree to the proposal, yet failed to spell out to voters that it meant leaving the UK. Salmond has already confirmed his government would allow the Electoral Commission, which was set up by the parliament in Westminster, to oversee the organisation and conduct of the referendum, but has so far refused to appoint it to scrutinise and test the question. The first minister has deflected attacks by his opponents by insisting that the commission would have \"a role\" in this process, without specifying how, but now there are signs that his government could give the commission the legal role of testing the question. \"The Scottish government and the Electoral Commission are agreed on the fact that the question should be properly and independently tested,\" a spokeswoman for the Scottish government said. \"We are happy to work with the commission to put the role that the commission will play in that on an appropriate statutory basis.\" The commission's role could be crucial: in 2010, it forced the UK government to drop the original question put forward by Nick Clegg for the AV referendum on voting reform, after finding voters did not properly understand his preferred wording. In its submission to the Scottish and UK government's separate consultations on the referendum, published onThursday, the commission said it was ultimately for politicians and the parliaments to decide which questions and how many questions would be put at the referendum. While stopping short of insisting that it carried out that task, it said any question had to be rigorously tested first and this had to be clearly set out in the legislation setting up the referendum. Clear rules for the referendum then needed to be agreed and in place at least 28 weeks before voting day. John McCormick, the commissioner for Scotland, said: \"A clear process for agreeing the question \u2013 that includes sufficient time for it to be independently tested with voters \u2013 will be particularly important. \"The people of Scotland face an historic decision and the referendum must take place in a way that is transparent, open to scrutiny, gives voters confidence and delivers a result accepted by all.\" Despite repeated complaints from opposition politicians and the UK government about confusing voters, the commission said it had no specific concerns about whether two questions could be put, including one on whether Scotland needed extra powers within the union. However, its submission said: \"Any referendum outcome needs to be an accurate reflection of what voters want. It is therefore essential that any referendum question presents the options to voters clearly, simply and neutrally, so that they can easily understand the question \u2013 and its implications \u2013 and answer it.\" Speaking in Edinburgh, Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, attempted to intensify the pressure on Salmond to agree a deal on posing just one \"yes or no\" question on independence in exchange for the legal authority to stage the referendum. Claiming he found Salmond's refusal to give ground on the timing of the referendum \"perplexing\", Moore said: \"We are making an open and generous offer. The straightforward independence referendum that has been the first minister's mission in life. But it's being met with complication, hesitation, and qualification. For whatever reasons the Scottish government is placing barriers on what should be a clear and straight road.\" The commission also raised concerns that Salmond's plans to hold the vote on a Saturday could cause problems with staging and counting the vote, since modern practice went against counting votes on a Sunday for practical, security and religious reasons. It also challenged the Scottish government's proposals to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote, for the first time in a UK referendum or election, warning that ministers had no clear strategy for guaranteeing they would register. The whole UK voting register is being recompiled in late 2014, the commission warned, introducing a further complication for Salmond's preferred date of Saturday 18 October, 2014. Meanwhile, an influential cross-party Westminster committee of MPs and peers has accused the UK government's national security council of complacency for failing to carry out any assessment about the impact Scotland's independence would have on the UK's defence and the future of Trident. The committee, in a report published on Thursday said independence \"could have a range of impacts from potential disputes over the response to security threats and the division of resources, to questions about basing of forces and the future of the UK's nuclear deterrent\". It quoted Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister, saying that Scotland's future was a matter for Scottish voters, and that \"we have not come across any practical difficulties arising at the moment and we do not anticipate at the moment any arising\". \u2022 The sub-heading on this article was corrected on 8 March 2012 to correspond with the story text. The original incorrectly said, \"Electoral Commission says proposed question asking voters if they want an independent Scotland is biased towards a yes vote\".",

      "body": "<p>Alex Salmond has been challenged by the Electoral Commission to test his referendum question on Scottish independence with the voters or risk accusations he is rigging the poll with a slanted question.</p> <p>In an unusually strong intervention, the commission said that thorough, independent scrutiny of any question in the referendum was essential to ensure it was clear, fair and neutral and to guarantee that the final result was reliable.</p> <p>There were signs on Wednesday night that the Scottish government was shifting ground by agreeing to allow the commission to independently try out the question on voters, suggesting it could be reworded to make it more neutral.</p> <p>The first minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/25/independent-scottish-parliament-may-2016\" title=\"\">announced in January</a> that he wanted to put a \"straightforward and clear\" 10-word question to Scotland's 4 million voters in the autumn of 2014, asking: \"Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?\"</p> <p>But his preferred wording was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland-blog/2012/jan/27/alex-salmond-s-first-challenge\" title=\"\">quickly challenged by a number of senior opinion pollsters</a> and prominent election analysts, who said it was biased in favour of a \"yes\" vote because it asked people to agree to the proposal, yet failed to spell out to voters that it meant leaving the UK.</p> <p>Salmond has already confirmed his government would allow the <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Electoral Commission</a>, which was set up by the parliament in Westminster, to oversee the organisation and conduct of the referendum, but has so far refused to appoint it to scrutinise and test the question.</p> <p>The first minister has deflected attacks by his opponents by insisting that the commission would have \"a role\" in this process, without specifying how, but now there are signs that his government could give the commission the legal role of testing the question.</p> <p>\"The Scottish government and the Electoral Commission are agreed on the fact that the question should be properly and independently tested,\" a spokeswoman for the Scottish government said. \"We are happy to work with the commission to put the role that the commission will play in that on an appropriate statutory basis.\"</p> <p>The commission's role could be crucial: in 2010, it forced the UK government to drop the original question put forward by Nick Clegg for the AV referendum on voting reform, after finding voters did not properly understand his preferred wording.</p> <p>In its submission to the Scottish and UK government's separate consultations on the referendum, published onThursday, the commission said it was ultimately for politicians and the parliaments to decide which questions and how many questions would be put at the referendum.</p> <p>While stopping short of insisting that it carried out that task, it said any question had to be rigorously tested first and this had to be clearly set out in the legislation setting up the referendum. Clear rules for the referendum then needed to be agreed and in place at least 28 weeks before voting day.</p> <p>John McCormick, the commissioner for Scotland, said: \"A clear process for agreeing the question \u2013 that includes sufficient time for it to be independently tested with voters \u2013 will be particularly important.</p> <p>\"The people of Scotland face an historic decision and the referendum must take place in a way that is transparent, open to scrutiny, gives voters confidence and delivers a result accepted by all.\"</p> <p>Despite repeated complaints from opposition politicians and the UK government about confusing voters, the commission said it had no specific concerns about whether two questions could be put, including one on whether Scotland needed extra powers within the union.</p> <p>However, its submission said: \"Any referendum outcome needs to be an accurate reflection of what voters want. It is therefore essential that any referendum question presents the options to voters clearly, simply and neutrally, so that they can easily understand the question \u2013 and its implications \u2013 and answer it.\"</p> <p>Speaking in Edinburgh, Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, attempted to intensify the pressure on Salmond to agree a deal on posing just one \"yes or no\" question on independence in exchange for the legal authority to stage the referendum.</p> <p>Claiming he found Salmond's refusal to give ground on the timing of the referendum \"perplexing\", Moore said: \"We are making an open and generous offer.
