      "bodyText": "It was one of those moments that make the heart beat stronger. On Wednesday morning, when Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 announced his team to play England in Sunday's Six Nations 'semi-final', Julien Dupuy felt the emotion coursing through his veins. \"The old ticker was definitely racing this morning,\" admits the scrum-half. \"Strange really, I'm not usually the sort of guy who gets affected by that sort of thing. But I have to say it was an immense pleasure to hear my name in the starting XV.\" For the former Leicester player, who rose to prominence from June to November 2009, it was a mixture of surprise and relief as Saint-Andr\u00e9 reacted to last Sunday's 17-17 draw against Ireland by making two changes, swapping his half-back pairing of Morgan Parra and Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc for a new charni\u00e8re of Dupuy and Lionel Beauxis. After failing to make the cut for last year's World Cup squad, Dupuy did not figure in Saint-Andr\u00e9's inaugural group for the Six Nations. And it was only after Dupuy's old nemesis Dimitri Yachvili pulled out of the Scotland game with a back injury that the 28-year-old finally found himself back in the French national side. A six-minute cameo at Murrayfield last month gave him a tantalising taste, but against Ireland, Dupuy had to content himself with 80 minutes on the bench. All of which means that when Dupuy takes the field at Stade de France, it will be his first start in the Six Nations, and his first start for Les Bleus since November 2009. \"It seems so far away now, such a long time ago,\" he says. \"Three years have gone by since I last played for the French XV, I've been through some difficult times, it's been hard, but I never lost the desire to play for my country again. It's been an eventful time. Today I feel the weight of the years, but it has also helped me mature.\" Flashback to December 2009. After a spectacular start to his international career, including a win (27-22) against New Zealand in his first Test in Dunedin in June, and another (20-13) against the world champion Springboks in Toulouse in November, Dupuy has clearly risen to the top of the pecking order in the French scrum-halves. In a handful of games his speed of pass, tactical awareness, ability to marshal the forwards, cool head and accurate goal-kicking combine to make him a key member of Marc Li\u00e8vremont's squad, and his place in the 2011 World Cup seems assured. But in a Heineken Cup pool game at Ravenhill, the scrum-half is involved in an incident with the Ulster flanker Stephen Ferris. Accused of eye-gouging, Dupuy is banned from playing for 24 weeks, reduced to 23 weeks on a technical detail. His season over, his named tarnished, Dupuy slips off the radar of the national side, his situation complicated even more the following season by the desperate performances of his club Stade Fran\u00e7ais, finishing in 11th place in the Top 14 and coming perilously close to being relegated for administrative reasons. Unsurprisingly, Dupuy's nerve endings are still a little raw when he is asked about his suspension. \"To be honest, it pisses me off that three years later you are still asking me about it,\" he says. \"I have said all there is to say about it, the past is the past. It is something that I should not have done, but something for which I believe the punishment was too severe. \"Today it is not something that I think about any more. I paid the price, and I played a full season last year without the slightest problem.\" Unfortunately for Dupuy, in his absence Yachvili and Parra claimed the No9 jersey as theirs, making it all the more complicated for the banished Parisian to work his way back. \"With Dimitri and Morgan, France had two very good scrum-halves, and I just had to learn to be patient. I just had to keep slogging away, proving myself in every game, week in, week out. It was complicated, and it's taken a long time, but I am just so happy to be back.\" Originally hailing from P\u00e9rigueux, Dupuy first signed at Biarritz as a 19-year-old. But he struggled to get game time, and even after six seasons with the Basque club, more often than not found himself as third-choice scrum-half behind Yachvili and Fabien Cibray. In 2008, after a season when he managed only 11 starts for Biarritz, Dupuy decided to pack his bags and head across the channel, throwing in his lot with the Tigers at Welford Road. \" I needed a change of routine, I needed something new,\" he says. \"When I went to Leicester, my aim was just to get some game time for a major team, and become the first-choice scrum-half. That's what happened. But at the same time I put in a lot of work. The physical training at Leicester was much harder than what I was used to, but it paid dividends in the end.\" It was an inspired move that would kick-start his career, and see him dominate the Premiership and power his way into the national side by the end of the season. With their scruffy little Frenchman at the helm, kicking all sorts of improbable goals in high\u2011pressure situations, Leicester not only won the Premiership, but they went on to challenge Leinster in the Heineken Cup final, finally going down 19-16. Dupuy insists that he was just lucky to be in a Leicester side that was on a roll. \"We had a fantastic team that season, and my year in England is something I will always remember,\" he says. \"The team's success turned out very favourably for me. For a scrum-half, it's always easy to look good when week after week your forwards are doing all the hard work up front.\" As for the difference in language and culture, although Dupuy insists that it \"breaks my balls\" to speak English today, he recognises the debt he has to English rugby. \"What surprised me most in England was the physical dimension of their game. The English don't complicate things, they don't ask questions, they just go out and play. In the Premiership, unlike the Top 14, there are no weak teams, and whether they are at home or away, they play just the same way. For us French, it's a completely different culture. What can I say? Les Anglais are different from us.\" What then are the memories that he cherishes of his stellar season with the Tigers? \"The amazing atmosphere in the club, the way the whole town got behind the team, the special buzz when you ran out on to the pitch at Welford Road.\" Not to mention his special relationship with Ben Youngs, on the bench for England: \"We used to get on like a house on fire. I made lots of friends in Leicester, but when I was there Ben was like my little brother.\" As for playing against his old friends, Dupuy says he will be pleased to have a beer with them \"after the victory at Stade de France\". \"For sure, this game will have a special flavour for me: it's my first start in the Six Nations, it's against England and it's Le Crunch. We see the English as arrogant, and they see us with our French defects, but isn't that what the crowds love? Isn't that what makes France v England games so fascinating?\"",

      "bodyText": "The joint administrator Paul Clark said there was global interest in Rangers by parties who have yet to declare their hand openly and warned the Blue Knights consortium that it must back up public statements of interest with action. He also praised the Rangers players for accepting pay cuts and said that without their taking a hit to their pay packets the administrators were considering \"complete decimation\" of the playing staff. The Blue Knights, headed by the former Rangers director Paul Murray and backed by supporters' groups, has confirmed it will launch a takeover bid and administrators Duff &amp; Phelps have set 16 March as the deadline for any formal notes of interest to be placed. However, Clark challenged Murray to back up his claims and indicated there could be a wider battle to take control of Rangers. \"We're talking about Scotland, wider United Kingdom and some overseas parties,\" Clark said. \"I don't want to be specific about bidders but there is at least one party from the far east. We've had some interest as well from the American continent. \"There's been a number of meetings over the last few days, more planned for next week and I've got two calls to two different parties over the weekend. We have an online data room for those parties so they can go in and take information over and above what we've told them in our meetings.\" Clark said that only \"serious bidders\" would be considered by the end the week. \"So anybody who has just been talking \u2013 and there are a few out there who have done a lot of talking \u2013 we want to seek them out and, as it were, put their money where their mouth is. If somebody wants to involve the media, that's fine. And if they become the owner then they can sit on the front page of all the papers saying: 'I did it.' But don't be surprised if that owner isn't one of the people that is media friendly. \"By the way, I am not ruling anybody out in this process, absolutely not. I'm just saying that nobody should assume that the only serious bidders are the ones who are in the public domain.\" The administrators also believe that they can somehow unravel a key deal between Rangers and Ticketus, the football finance company that bought 100,000 Rangers season tickets for \u00a324.4m. That arrangement was agreed with the club's owner, Craig Whyte, before he formally bought Rangers. The administrator has also sought to placate supporters over any input Whyte will have on Rangers in the future. \"I don't see him [Whyte] as a secured creditor, I don't see him as on-going owner of Rangers,\" Clark added. \"I don't see him as that important going forward. We're in control of the process. In terms of his influence on the outcome to all of this, I think he has little or no relevance. In terms of Rangers' future [in the] medium to long term, he is irrelevant. \"He has no rights, in my view, to Ibrox or [the training ground] Murray Park. The only rights he could possibly have over them is if his secured creditor status was proven and he had any value to it. He doesn't have any value. So if he's not a secured creditor he has no rights to Ibrox or Murray Park. \"Look at the bigger picture and the Scottish FA have announced that he is not a fit and proper person in accordance with the SFA rules, and therefore he couldn't come back. We never thought he could come back to Rangers. The value of Craig Whyte's floating charge security is zero. And if it's zero it has no impact. There is no money due to him. He paid no money so there is nothing to assign to him.\" Clark paid his latest tribute to the Rangers squad, who have agreed to pay cuts until the end of the season. Such a move has guaranteed the club can continue until then. \"Let's talk about what the alternative would have looked like,\" Clark said. \"There was mention over the last week of between eight and 11 players being made redundant. Those numbers were quite right, but even after we had made those redundancies we would have still needed a 50% pay cut from the players who remained. If those cuts had not been made, and I couldn't do the sums up until now, if we had got no pay cuts from players we would have been looking at cuts of up to 20 players in total. We were looking at complete decimation of the squad.\"",

We have an online data room for those parties so they can go in and take information over and above what we've told them in our meetings.\"</p> <p>Clark said that only \"serious bidders\" would be considered by the end the week. \"So anybody who has just been talking \u2013 and there are a few out there who have done a lot of talking \u2013 we want to seek them out and, as it were, put their money where their mouth is. If somebody wants to involve the media, that's fine. And if they become the owner then they can sit on the front page of all the papers saying: 'I did it.' But don't be surprised if that owner isn't one of the people that is media friendly.</p> <p>\"By the way, I am not ruling anybody out in this process, absolutely not. I'm just saying that nobody should assume that the only serious bidders are the ones who are in the public domain.\"</p> <p>The administrators also believe that they can somehow unravel a key deal between Rangers and Ticketus, the football finance company that bought 100,000 Rangers season tickets for \u00a324.4m. That arrangement was agreed with the club's owner, Craig Whyte, before he formally bought Rangers. The administrator has also sought to placate supporters over any input Whyte will have on Rangers in the future.</p> <p>\"I don't see him [Whyte] as a secured creditor, I don't see him as on-going owner of Rangers,\" Clark added. \"I don't see him as that important going forward. We're in control of the process. In terms of his influence on the outcome to all of this, I think he has little or no relevance. In terms of Rangers' future [in the] medium to long term, he is irrelevant.</p> <p>\"He has no rights, in my view, to Ibrox or [the training ground] Murray Park. The only rights he could possibly have over them is if his secured creditor status was proven and he had any value to it. He doesn't have any value. So if he's not a secured creditor he has no rights to Ibrox or Murray Park.</p> <p>\"Look at the bigger picture and the Scottish FA have announced that he is not a fit and proper person in accordance with the SFA rules, and therefore he couldn't come back. We never thought he could come back to Rangers. The value of Craig Whyte's floating charge security is zero. And if it's zero it has no impact. There is no money due to him. He paid no money so there is nothing to assign to him.\"</p> <p>Clark paid his latest tribute to the Rangers squad, who have agreed to pay cuts until the end of the season. Such a move has guaranteed the club can continue until then. \"Let's talk about what the alternative would have looked like,\" Clark said. \"There was mention over the last week of between eight and 11 players being made redundant. Those numbers were quite right, but even after we had made those redundancies we would have still needed a 50% pay cut from the players who remained. If those cuts had not been made, and I couldn't do the sums up until now, if we had got no pay cuts from players we would have been looking at cuts of up to 20 players in total. We were looking at complete decimation of the squad.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was Kauto Star's sheer wellbeing that caused the problem. Paul Nicholls, his trainer, shows irritation as he relives the moment, just over a fortnight ago, when the steeplechaser's joie de vivre during a practice session at his Somerset stable put his chance of a third Cheltenham Gold Cup success in jeopardy. \"He was just pissing about, larking about, acting a prat and trying to kick everything,\" Nicholls recalls. It is not a new development. Those who have backed Kauto Star since he first ran in Britain more than seven years ago will remember races that were sewn up until he let his attention drift and jumped into the final fence rather than over it. \"Half his career, it's why I put a sheepskin noseband on him, because he wasn't concentrating,\" Nicholls adds. \"And he was doing that again, not concentrating on what he was doing, made an error, tried to get out of it but couldn't. Upside down, he went. He was physically shaken afterwards, just in shock.\" It was a much happier Kauto Star who coasted round Wincanton after racing finished there on Friday, proving his wellbeing to a relieved crowd. He was declared \"100% sound\" on Saturday and, provided he sails through a final schooling session on Monday, is as likely to make it to the starting line as anything else in the field for Friday's Gold Cup, the highlight of the Cheltenham Festival. At the time, Kauto Star's tumble was just the latest in a series of disasters for Nicholls, including injuries to a number of high-profile animals and a bout of coughing in his stable that \"seemed to sweep round like bloody wildfire\". But even such traumas can be put into perspective over a cup of tea in a quiet room, 100 miles from the stable and six days before the Festival's first race. \"It's been interesting,\" is the trainer's wry assessment, as he sinks into a chair at the West End home of a very rich man, the owner of many racehorses. It is possibly the last bit of peace he can expect before next Saturday. \"I suppose you could say we've been lucky in a number of years when all the big ones have met their targets and not had any problems. This year, it's all just been a bit of a nightmare.\" The coughing must have been especially alarming for a trainer who takes such elaborate precautions against infection and who has been able to avoid the viruses that have blighted other yards for entire seasons. But he was able to contain it and the worst was over after 10 days. \"I don't see it being too much of a problem,\" he says, \"because they all look so well and they were never sick. \"It might turn out to be the best Festival ever, you just don't know. That's how it is when you have a huge number of horses. Every night, you go on your rounds and you're fraught with what you might find.\" Still a month shy of his 50th birthday, Nicholls is one of the four most successful trainers in Festival history, with 30 winners in the past 13 years. His contenders this time include Big Buck's, trying to land the World Hurdle for a record fourth time, Zarkandar, the unbeaten second-favourite for the Champion Hurdle, and Al Ferof, who will attempt to repeat last year's victory over the much-vaunted Sprinter Sacre. \"It's probably not as strong a squad as some years we've had, but quite a lot of them have good chances. I'm looking forward to it.\" Thanks to Kauto Star's self-inflicted wounds, that anticipation is shot through with anxiety and not a little frustration because Nicholls clearly feels the horse would have had an excellent chance in the Gold Cup with a clear run. \"Before this little hiccup, I would have said he's in as good form as he's ever been. \"His King George win this year was one of his best ever performances. And his Haydock win was brilliant. I think he's probably been in the form of his life this year, at the peak of his powers. This has taken the wind out of our sails a little bit.\" There is no denying that Kauto Star has been better this season than last, when Nicholls heard him making a noise on the gallops that suggested a breathing problem. For no evident reason, the noise disappeared this winter and he has attacked his work up the vertiginous Ditcheat hill with renewed relish. \"He just looks better, everything about him, he's stronger.\" The trainer is now inclined to think that Kauto Star may have taken a full year to recover from his shocking fall in the 2010 Gold Cup, when, for a brief moment, his neck twisted against the turf under the weight of his entire body. Nicholls describes how, \"for the best part of two months\", the horse couldn't lower his head to his feed bucket, which had to be placed on a pile of tyres until he could flex his neck once more. \"He was in a bad way for a while and it might have taken longer than we think to get over it, mentally and physically. That's why he might be a bit sore now, an old injury just flamed up a little bit. \"To win those races at a high level, everything has to be right and I don't think he was quite right last year [when he was third behind Long Run], or the year when he fell, but he certainly seems OK now. If he could just run his race, it'd be fantastic. I'd be awfully proud if he just turned up at Cheltenham in good order. Just to be there, because they'll cheer him before he runs on Friday, like they did at Haydock. People will just go there to see him.\" Nicholls calls Kauto Star \"the horse of a lifetime\" and struggles to accept that he might not be the best there has ever been, though he has no memory of Arkle, a triple Gold Cup winner in the 1960s regarded by many as an unmatchable giant. A child at the time, he also missed out on the 1969 Gold Cup, won by What A Myth, the last horse of Kauto Star's advanced age, 12, to land the race. It is the sort of detail that fascinates punters but the trainer could hardly be less impressed. \"Statistics are there to be broken,\" he says and points out that no runner as young as five had won the Champion Chase before he sent out Master Minded to do so in 2008. Mention of Master Minded provokes further reflection because he and Denman, two of the best to pass through Nicholls's yard, have been forced out of the sport by injuries. Kauto Star's career is not expected to last into 2013 and the trainer can even imagine him being retired on the spot if he wins on Friday. \"It is nearly the end of an era, without a shadow of a doubt,\" he says, \"and now I'm focusing on trying to get the next generation. But we were so incredibly lucky to have had all of those that, if I didn't get any more, I'd have nearly outrun my luck.\" It might be imagined that, in these straitened times, there would be limited competition for the right to buy burly steeplechasers, prone to injury and without any breeding potential, but interest is apparently keener than ever. Nicholls's experience suggests that every other millionaire would like to own a Cheltenham winner, their attention perhaps caught by the achievements of his runners over the past decade. \"It's bloody hard to buy Kautos and Denmans and Master Mindeds now. There was a time, five or six years ago, there weren't too many people in the market. Now, if those horses come up, there's nine or 10 people trying to buy them. They're hard to come by.\"",

      "bodyText": "It took Nicky Henderson 33 years to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup but, having finally done so with Long Run last year, he may follow up in Friday's running of the race with Burton Port. It would count as one of his most remarkable pieces of training, since the horse has recently returned from more than a year off, but he appears better than ever and is capable of beating Kauto Star and Long Run. This would have seemed a most unlikely outcome in March 2010, when Burton Port was Henderson's third-string in another Festival race, the RSA Chase, behind Long Run and Punchestowns. Those two were the centre of attention at the trainer's pre-Cheltenham media day that year, when Burton Port was introduced with the words: \"And the owner tells me I must not forget to mention this one \u2026\" It was a joke, up to a point. The trainer has always liked this horse, but he has also been stunned at the progress made since he was switched to fences. Burton Port ran on dourly to be second in that RSA, a short-head in front of Long Run, and may have done better if the early pace had been a stronger one. Later that year, he showed great resilience to be second in Diamond Harry's Hennessy after a shuddering blunder at Newbury's cross-fence. It was his last run for 14 months. In normal circumstances, a chaser who was absent for so long would have to be treated with the greatest suspicion but Burton Port is still only eight and has reportedly been burning up the Lambourn gallops as never before. He was a fine second in last month's Denman Chase, finishing half a length behind Long Run under a sympathetic ride from Barry Geraghty, whose minimal urgings suggested the result did not matter half so much as the taking part. Even with 10lb more to carry this time, relative to that rival, Burton Port (3.20) should be a serious contender who is overpriced at 15-2. Long Run's jumping appears to have regressed and he may have won the King George on Boxing Day but for clouting the last. Still, he makes more appeal than Kauto Star, for whom a final fairytale is surely out of reach. Two years older than any winner since 1969, he would have been up against it, even with the perfect preparation. Medermit would be worth a few quid each-way if he turned up. He is no certainty to cope with the trip but his Festival form reminds me of the 2006 winner, War Of Attrition, and the fast ground should help. He is probably not quick enough for Thursday's Ryanair Chase, though his owners are said to be leaning in that direction. This could be a sensational week for Henderson, whose contender for the Arkle Chase, Sprinter Sacre (2.05), has grown into one of the most impressive looking steeplechasers ever to grace the track. Some will warn you that big horses can be too clumsy for this undulating course, but this one is an athlete who adjusts to what happens in front of him and it will be a crying shame if he cannot win on Tuesday. Henderson's Bobs Worth (2.40) is well suited by Cheltenham and can land Wednesday's RSA Chase, whether Grands Crus turns up or not, while his Oscar Whisky (3.20) probably has the stamina and certainly has the pace to give Big Buck's a hard time in Thursday's World Hurdle. Dry conditions will help him. That will be a major relief for those bookmakers who have offered big odds about the four winners of the week's major races being the same as last year, because the first two should give backers hope of a payout. There is simply no opposing Hurricane Fly (3.20) in the Champion Hurdle on Tuesday, while Sizing Europe (3.20) faces uninspiring opposition in the Champion Chase on Wednesday. Vendor (4.40) in the Fred Winter and Saphir River (2.05) in the Pertemps, ex-French hurdlers who have one run in Britain between them, can both win to underline the point that the handicapping of such horses should be reassessed. But the most attractive bet in the handicaps comes in the County Hurdle on Friday, in which Dirar (2.05), a 16-1 shot, can add to his victory in the 2010 Ebor.

He is probably not quick enough for Thursday's Ryanair Chase, though his owners are said to be leaning in that direction.</p> <p>This could be a sensational week for Henderson, whose contender for the Arkle Chase, <strong>Sprinter Sacre (2.05)</strong>, has grown into one of the most impressive looking steeplechasers ever to grace the track. Some will warn you that big horses can be too clumsy for this undulating course, but this one is an athlete who adjusts to what happens in front of him and it will be a crying shame if he cannot win on Tuesday.</p> <p>Henderson's <strong>Bobs Worth (2.40) </strong>is well suited by Cheltenham and can land Wednesday's RSA Chase, whether Grands Crus turns up or not, while his <strong>Oscar Whisky (3.20)</strong> probably has the stamina and certainly has the pace to give Big Buck's a hard time in Thursday's World Hurdle. Dry conditions will help him.</p> <p>That will be a major relief for those bookmakers who have offered big odds about the four winners of the week's major races being the same as last year, because the first two should give backers hope of a payout. There is simply no opposing <strong>Hurricane Fly (3.20) </strong>in the Champion Hurdle on Tuesday, while <strong>Sizing Europe (3.20)</strong> faces uninspiring opposition in the Champion Chase on Wednesday.</p> <p><strong>Vendor (4.40)</strong> in the Fred Winter and <strong>Saphir River (2.05) </strong>in the Pertemps, ex-French hurdlers who have one run in Britain between them, can both win to underline the point that the handicapping of such horses should be reassessed. But the most attractive bet in the handicaps comes in the County Hurdle on Friday, in which <strong>Dirar (2.05)</strong>, a 16-1 shot, can add to his victory in the 2010 Ebor.</p> <h2>SELECTIONS</h2> <h2>TUESDAY</h2> <p><strong>1.30</strong> Steps To Freedom <strong>2.05</strong> Sprinter Sacre <strong>2.40</strong> Summery Justice* <strong>3.20</strong> Hurricane Fly <strong>4.00</strong> Scotsirish <strong>5.15</strong> Niceonefrankie</p> <h2>WEDNESDAY</h2> <p><strong>2.05</strong> Batonnier <strong>2.40</strong> Bobs Worth <strong>3.20</strong> Sizing Europe <strong>4.00</strong> Arab League* <strong>4.40</strong> Vendor</p> <h2>THURSDAY</h2> <p><strong>2.05</strong> Saphir River <strong>2.40</strong> Rubi Light <strong>3.20</strong> Oscar Whisky <strong>4.40</strong> Summery Justice*</p> <h2>FRIDAY</h2> <p><strong>1.30</strong> Pearl Swan <strong>2.05</strong> Dirar<strong> 2.40</strong> Rocky Creek <strong>3.20</strong> Burton Port/Medermit (each-way if he runs) <strong>4.40</strong> Arab League* <strong>5.15</strong> Edgardo Sol</p> <p>*<em>These horses have multiple entries</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Roy Hodgson is exceeding expectations. Again. When he surprisingly accepted West Bromwich Albion's plea for help a month after his unhappy departure from Liverpool last year, his mission was to rescue this archetypal yo-yo club from another downward spin. They were only a goal above the relegation zone. Under Hodgson's guidance, they finished eight points clear. This season, with 11 games to go, the Midlands club are 13 points away from danger and looking up rather than down. That is a big \"boing\" forward for the Baggies. Perceptions of Albion are changing. \"I've said to the boys we're going to find it harder to have that underdog epithet when we go to play matches, which can be quite handy sometimes when you go to the bigger clubs,\" says Hodgson, who takes his team to Manchester United on Sunday in search of a fourth win in a row. \"You can sometimes see [the opposition] go out on the field thinking: 'This isn't going to be particularly difficult today,' and then suddenly you perform above your status and take them by surprise. We've lost that now: I don't think Alex's team will be expecting an easy game against us. Now teams prepare for potential defeats against us.\" Sir Alex Ferguson is, indeed, conscious of the threat posed by a side that, in their past three games, have scored five against Wolves, four against Sunderland and beaten Chelsea. \"West Brom are in good form just now,\" the Scot says. \"We respect that. Roy Hodgson always has his teams well organised. He couldn't win [during his time] at Anfield. Sometimes the timing is bad for certain jobs and that was bad timing for him. But you cannot dispute his credibility, his ability and the career he has had.\" While West Brom have seldom been so unworried about the drop at this stage of a Premier League season, Hodgson's success has filled fans with a new kind of dread: that their manager could be lured away. Already this week the former chairman of the Football Association, Lord Triesman, has suggested that Hodgson should be the new England manager. Victory at United may lead others to echo that call. Hodgson himself has warned against the folly of appointing someone on the back of a short-term winning streak and has suggested the FA take a broader view and \"get someone with the right profile assembled over a long period\". The thing is, Hodgson looks attractive from that angle, too. Not that Hodgson is touting himself for the job. He is at pains to stress he is \"neutral, blank\" when it comes to the identity of the long-term successor to Fabio Capello, declaring: \"I do not rule myself in or out.\" But nor has he ruled himself in or out of West Brom. His contract expires around the time Euro 2012 kicks off. The club would like him to sign a new one and clearly Hodgson is happy at The Hawthorns, but there is a sense that if England came calling, this 64-year-old \u2013 who has thrived in many different lands but never embraced the comfort zone \u2013 may see it as his crowning glory. Certainly the easy thing would be to count himself out of the reckoning for the England job. There is such popular support for Harry Redknapp that, unless the Tottenham manager announces he does not want it, anyone else who were to get it would risk being denounced as an impostor. Hodgson was treated like that by some Liverpool fans in 2010 when he surrendered folk-hero status at Fulham to replace Rafael Ben\u00edtez at Anfield, where large sections of the crowd remained loyal to the Spaniard and viewed his successor as a cheap stooge of a despised regime. Add similar resentment to the expectation that accompanies the England position and you would have a recipe for intense pressure. Even without such resentment, the England manager position is called the impossible job. Hodgson, mind you, thinks that is a misnomer. \"I don't think any job is impossible,\" he says. \"It's true that if it's always going to be that if you win the World Cup or European Championship you're a success and if you don't you're a failure, then you're bedding yourself for a lack of success because there aren't many coaches who have won those things and there are thousands who haven't. But England have won a major tournament \u2013 only one, but they've still won one \u2013 and we are working in a league where football of a very high quality is played and we are producing players who most people would regard as top European standard, possibly world standard. So impossible? No.\" Hodgson is one of the few English managers to have experience of successfully leading a country, having masterminded Switzerland's improbable run to the last 16 of the 1994 World Cup and elevated Finland to previously unreached heights more than a decade later. It is typical of his fair-mindedness, and perhaps of his confidence in his coaching abilities \u2013 he is a hands-on gaffer who directs training himself \u2013 that he does not overstate the value of such international experience. \"No,\" he says when asked whether there is much difference between managing a club and a country. \"It's still about team preparation. There might be more meetings and situations where you're required to represent the country in some way that wouldn't necessarily happen to you if you're a club manager, but other than that I haven't found any differences in my approach between running a club side and a national team. \"With a national team you've just got to be even more focused on what's most important because the time you've got with the players is limited. Otherwise the approach is pretty much the same and the top club managers will always be capable of being top international managers, perhaps even more so than in the other direction because there might be some international managers who wouldn't relish the pressures of the job on a daily basis.\" Undoubtedly Hodgson can excel at either role. West Brom fans hope he continues in his current one. The FA could do worse than ask him to do the other.",

      "bodyText": "As Michael Schumacher approaches the third season of his grand prix comeback, with not so much as a podium place to add to the seven world titles he won during his first incarnation between 1994 and 2004, Ross Brawn is pondering a little matter of three-tenths of a second, representing the average margin conceded by the 42-year-old former champion to his Mercedes team-mate, the 26-year-old Nico Rosberg, throughout last year's qualifying sessions. If Schumacher is finally going to justify the enormous financial and marketing investment in his return to the track by regaining the victory habit, where he is he going to find those vital three-tenths? \"Maybe he doesn't,\" comes the surprising answer from Brawn, who knows more than anyone in the Formula One paddock about Schumacher the competitor. \"Maybe he lives with it and uses his experience and knowledge to compensate.\" Speaking before his departure for Melbourne, where the season opens with next weekend's Australian Grand Prix, Brawn brushes aside the suggestion that Schumacher might have lost his edge. It is not, he said, a matter of something as simple as the courage and self-belief required to take a 180mph bend flat out in seventh gear. \"If Michael were feathering the throttle in fast corners and not confident about his ability to deal with it, you'd say, well, clearly, you can see it's slipping away from him. But you don't see that \u2013 in fact often he's the same or even quicker in the fast corners. Nico just seems to have more of an intuitive ability to get the most out of the tyres on one lap. \"In the races, where it's a more consistent process, there's nothing to tell between the two of them. There are some races where Nico's dominant and some where Michael's very strong. I don't know if he will find the difference in qualifying, because Nico is very special in those circumstances, one of the best I've seen. At the moment Michael hasn't understood how he can get that.\" The pace of technical progress in Formula One is unrelenting, and things have changed considerably on the tyre front since 2006, when both men left Ferrari, Brawn to spend a couple of years' sabbatical with his fishing rod and Schumacher embarking on what turned out to be a three-year retirement. \"We still had grooved tyres, and there was a tyre war going on between Bridgestone and Michelin,\" Brawn says. \"We were the main Bridgestone customer and the tyres had been developed with a large input from Michael, so naturally they suited his style and approach.\" When Schumacher returned, it was to a world in which the rules said that all drivers had to use the same rubber. \"Now there's only one tyre out there, it's the same for everybody, and he's got to work out how he's going to get that performance from it,\" Brawn continued. \"There's no testing, or very little, so you can't go out there with 10 sets of tyres and say, right, I'm going to do one lap on each set and work out how to squeeze out that last little drop. \"Perhaps the tyres have evolved in a way that suits some drivers more than others. Nico is quite exceptional in that respect, and he's a great asset to the team. I think when he wins a race, you'll see another step in his performance.\" Brawn saw that happen to Jenson Button, his other world champion, in 2009, when the team now known as Mercedes was briefly called Brawn GP, having risen from the ashes of Honda's withdrawal. \"Jenson had won a race before, in slightly odd circumstances. But when he started to win races because he was the fastest driver in the fastest car, he changed. He became far more consistent and we started to see the driver that he is now. When Nico gets into that position I think we'll start to see things from him that we didn't know he could do.\" Meanwhile the rest of Formula One looks with surprise on the underachievement of a team whose drivers have failed to make a dent in the supremacy of Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari. A couple of fifth places were Rosberg's best finishes last season, while Schumacher \u2013 the winner of a record and probably unsurpassable 91 grands prix \u2013 managed a fourth in the wet in Canada. In the terms with which Mercedes is familiar, this is simply not good enough. If Ferrari is the most glamorous name in grand prix racing, with the longest continuous involvement in Formula One, that of the German team is the one that traditionally inspires awe. Their cars have been around since the days when pneumatic tyres were a novelty, and their participation was virtually synonymous with victory. Sitting in his office in Brackley, almost within earshot of the racing engines at Silverstone, Brawn remains the most successful team boss of the modern era, but he seems far removed in place and time from the legendary figures who presided over earlier eras of Mercedes dominance. These include Max Sailer, installed as technical director after driving in the famous French Grand Prix of 1914, when a clean sweep of the top three places by the German cars brought down the curtain on the Edwardian era of motor racing; Alfred Neubauer, who invented pit signalling and managed the team with an eye for the smallest detail; and Rudi Uhlenhaut, the head of the experimental department, who often took the Silver Arrows of the 1930s and 1950s out on tests and was said, even in the Fangio era, to have been capable of producing laps as fast as those of his top drivers. Clearly it would not be desirable for their English successor to be the first to fail. \"That's true,\" Brawn says, with a slightly rueful laugh. \"I think if the team doesn't perform over a long period of time, you have to accept the consequences. You're here to represent the history of Mercedes. It's one of the iconic brands, and if you damage it then the whole project won't be attractive to the board. They've said, and I share their opinion, that fourth place in the championship is not what we want to achieve. \"Where I take comfort is that Mercedes have now been in Formula One in this era for almost 20 years, admittedly mostly as an engine supplier but also as a high-level shareholder in McLaren for a number of years. They lived with the ups and downs and didn't falter when things got difficult. As a company they don't flap around in the wind. They've got stamina and they understand that things are built over time. They're passionate about the sport and where it fits into the company. That gives me faith.\" In order to bolster their belief in his ability to create a winning team, he spent last year adding senior engineers to a structure that was stripped to bare bones when Honda suddenly pulled out at the end of 2008, leaving Brawn and his colleagues to devise a management takeover. Lack of sponsorship meant that an organisation of more than 700 employees was suddenly cut by almost half. Now it is back up above the 500 mark, the newcomers including three highly experienced technical figures: Bob Bell from Renault, Geoff Willis from Red Bull and Aldo Costa from Ferrari, joining the chief designer, John Owen. But is their WO3, the car that will appear at Albert Park this week with the familiar three-pointed star on its nose, really a Mercedes-Benz or just the product of a bunch of UK-based engineers who happen to be wearing Mercedes overalls? \"You can't suddenly flick a switch,\" Brawn says. \"I'd be lying if I said that from the point we became Mercedes there was silver blood running through my veins. It's a transition. It takes a while. But I've got to know the board and how passionate they are about the history of Mercedes. Now I'm proud of it, and the reigniting of the history of Mercedes as a grand prix team is something I've grown very passionate about. You're holding the lantern for a while, and it does carry certain responsibilities. I want to be part of the history of Mercedes.\"",

If Ferrari is the most glamorous name in grand prix racing, with the longest continuous involvement in Formula One, that of the German team is the one that traditionally inspires awe. Their cars have been around since the days when pneumatic tyres were a novelty, and their participation was virtually synonymous with victory.</p> <p>Sitting in his office in Brackley, almost within earshot of the racing engines at Silverstone, Brawn remains the most successful team boss of the modern era, but he seems far removed in place and time from the legendary figures who presided over earlier eras of Mercedes dominance. These include Max Sailer, installed as technical director after driving in the famous French Grand Prix of 1914, when a clean sweep of the top three places by the German cars brought down the curtain on the Edwardian era of motor racing; Alfred Neubauer, who invented pit signalling and managed the team with an eye for the smallest detail; and Rudi Uhlenhaut, the head of the experimental department, who often took the Silver Arrows of the 1930s and 1950s out on tests and was said, even in the Fangio era, to have been capable of producing laps as fast as those of his top drivers. Clearly it would not be desirable for their English successor to be the first to fail.</p> <p>\"That's true,\" Brawn says, with a slightly rueful laugh. \"I think if the team doesn't perform over a long period of time, you have to accept the consequences. You're here to represent the history of Mercedes. It's one of the iconic brands, and if you damage it then the whole project won't be attractive to the board. They've said, and I share their opinion, that fourth place in the championship is not what we want to achieve.</p> <p>\"Where I take comfort is that Mercedes have now been in Formula One in this era for almost 20 years, admittedly mostly as an engine supplier but also as a high-level shareholder in McLaren for a number of years. They lived with the ups and downs and didn't falter when things got difficult. As a company they don't flap around in the wind. They've got stamina and they understand that things are built over time. They're passionate about the sport and where it fits into the company. That gives me faith.\"</p> <p>In order to bolster their belief in his ability to create a winning team, he spent last year adding senior engineers to a structure that was stripped to bare bones when Honda suddenly pulled out at the end of 2008, leaving Brawn and his colleagues to devise a management takeover. Lack of sponsorship meant that an organisation of more than 700 employees was suddenly cut by almost half. Now it is back up above the 500 mark, the newcomers including three highly experienced technical figures: Bob Bell from Renault, Geoff Willis from Red Bull and Aldo Costa from Ferrari, joining the chief designer, John Owen.</p> <p>But is their WO3, the car that will appear at Albert Park this week with the familiar three-pointed star on its nose, really a Mercedes-Benz or just the product of a bunch of UK-based engineers who happen to be wearing Mercedes overalls?</p> <p>\"You can't suddenly flick a switch,\" Brawn says. \"I'd be lying if I said that from the point we became Mercedes there was silver blood running through my veins. It's a transition. It takes a while. But I've got to know the board and how passionate they are about the history of Mercedes. Now I'm proud of it, and the reigniting of the history of Mercedes as a grand prix team is something I've grown very passionate about. You're holding the lantern for a while, and it does carry certain responsibilities. I want to be part of the history of Mercedes.\"</p>",

Sager did have a good reason for the challenge rather than just a show of machismo: there has been a remarkable rise in the sale of scooters over the past 14 months. Despite a chilly start to the year, sales in the UK rose by 7.6% in the first two months of this year, with an 18% increase of 100cc-plus models, (the ones that adult commuters buy). This follows a 12% rise last year in overall sales, which included 20% for the larger models. Almost all other two-wheel categories showed a drop in registrations last year, according to the Motorcycle Industry Association (MCIA) figures. So why scooters? For drivers, mounting anger at the increase in fuel prices may be playing a part. Petrol prices hit a new high last Wednesday as motorists faced paying an average of \u00a36 per gallon at garage forecourts for the first time. An up to 30% hike in the cost of parking at train stations earlier this year and an annual train fares increase of 5.9% has also no doubt contributed. But is commuting by scooter an easier, quicker and more enjoyable solution? There was only one way to find out ... \u25a0 The train journey My commute takes me from Hertfordshire into London via the train and tube, a journey of approximately 75 minutes and 23 miles. It was a fine, sunny morning when we set off on our race, which dashed my hopes of winning somewhat. My train was on time \u2013 a good start \u2013 and I had a seat. I got to sit down with a cup of tea and read the newspaper on my iPad. By the time I reached London the train was packed \u2013 and the tube even more so. I had my head in someone's armpit for the next 20 minutes. At King's Cross I jostled my way off the tube in the general wave of people rushing for the exits and, in the spirit of competitiveness, actually ran up the escalator (OK, walked quickly). After a fast-paced five minute walk to the office I arrived \u2026 first. Sager had had trouble finding a parking spot and was five minutes behind me. \u25a0 The scooter experience The commute was a journey of two halves, writes Dan Sager. The first leg takes you along the A10 dual carriageway, which is fast in places but grinds to a halt at roundabouts and traffic lights. On the scooter (a 125cc Peugeot Tweet) this was no problem as I simply filtered to the front of the queue. Once \"inside\" the M25, now that Transport for London allows motorcycles to use all its Red Route bus lanes, you can glide past the static lines of cars, vans and trucks with ease and it also gives a great feeling of safety. For the return journey we both left just after 3pm, which coincided with the school run so the traffic was pretty bad. However, using the tried and tested combination of filtering and bus lanes I arrived in Hertfordshire a full quarter of an hour ahead of Lisa, whose train had been delayed. \u25a0 The conclusions There's probably little to choose between scooter and train in terms of time for this particular journey. Sager says: \"However, the scooter has two trump cards. Firstly, in terms of pence per mile: it costs around half as much as train travel. Secondly, it gives you complete freedom to travel when (and where) you want. You won't miss your train if you get held up at work and you won't be delayed by industrial action, maintenance, and so on.\" Bachelor says: \"I hate commuting to work. However, I do get to relax for part of the journey. I'm not sure I am brave enough to travel by scooter \u2013 I used to cycle and know what London drivers are like. Plus, official stats show there were more than 4,000 motorcycle and scooter casualties in London in 2010. But the cost argument is compelling and it seems an ideal solution for someone who is braver than me.\"",

      "bodyText": "For England an ugly win will be beautiful if they can prise a victory out of Sunday's tantalising encounter in Paris. Stuart Lancaster's young side lost with honour against Wales a fortnight ago but they will want to win at any cost and will ignore the talk of boring rugby that has swirled around during the week. Firstly, the game is away and, secondly, it is against France. Both teams' chances of a grand slam may have slipped through their fingers in the past fortnight, France's agonisingly when Lionel Beauxis failed to nail one of two late drop-goal attempts in the draw against Ireland last Sunday and England when Scott Williams scampered away to score the winning try for Wales a week earlier. But there is a special frisson around this fixture and it should be compelling. England begin the game with only five of the players who kicked off against France in their World Cup quarter-final five months ago, while France's coach Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 has made an eye-catching decision to change both his half-backs, the scrum-half Julien Dupuy and the fly-half Beauxis coming in for Morgan Parra and Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc. Dimitri Yachvili, whose place-kicking has tormented England in the past, is fit but can't get back on the bench. It is not difficult to see what Saint-Andr\u00e9 is trying to achieve. The sound of screaming in the Stade de France on Sunday afternoon may be that of the ball begging for mercy. Beauxis will kick the leather off it. France couldn't get out of their defensive third last weekend because the kicking game of Parra and Trinh-Duc was not sound enough. Beauxis will sit deeper to kick. Nine out of 10 attempts by last week's half-backs to clear kicks failed against Ireland, giving Rob Kearney and Co the chance to run back at them. Parra in particular struck all his box-kicks too long to compete for and this kept France under pressure in their own half. A repeat will be a gift for Ben Foden and the England wings. Dupuy and Beauxis have been brought in to solve this problem. The former Leicester Tiger Dupuy has a more accurate box-kick that can allow French chasers to compete and Beauxis has a more accurate clearing kick that will fly over the heads of England's back three or long into touch. Putting these kickers under pressure will be key for England. Charlie Hodgson has shown how to create mayhem with his two charge-downs against Scotland and Italy, and Mouritz Botha very nearly scored a third unlikely try by charging down Rhys Priestland's kick a fortnight ago. England must keep this up because if the French duo are allowed an easy ride with their kicking game it will provide a platform for the French set piece in England's half where they will launch their driving lineout, a very typical Saint-Andr\u00e9 tactic. The lineout will be another key area. It is an area much improved for England by the introduction of Geoff Parling, while Tom Palmer of Stade Fran\u00e7ais will be anxious to show the French public what they will miss when he moves back to Wasps this summer should he be launched off the bench. Parling, calling the lineouts in the absence of Palmer, has enjoyed a sound start to the Six Nations but he is now up against one of the best lineouts, defensively and offensively, in the world. The key trio for France is Imanol Harinordoquy, Yoann Maestri and Julien Bonnaire. Pascal Pape and Thierry Dusatoir are capable of going up if those three are marked. England's main threat is around Parling and Croft and this is where they will want their best ball. Botha and Chris Robshaw can then come into the equation and if all options are closed down Ben Morgan will be available. A typical French attacking lineout will see Harinordoquy in the middle with Maestri and Bonnaire behind him. It will be Parling and Croft's responsibility to shut this trio down. This will be a real test for Parling with the French piling on pressure on Paul O'Connell last week. France may be misfiring at the moment but they have a lot of weapons. The change of half-backs will not improve France's passing game, however with Beauxis sitting deeper. They have struggled to create any real shape from the set piece especially when they go wide. This is best illustrated by the laboured passing in midfield and Aurelien Rougerie's gift of an interception to Tommy Bowe. Wesley Fofana is an inside-shoulder runner capable of changing lines late. You rarely see him pass, other than short offloads. Because of this they have been quite easy to defend against. France have been going so deep to give themselves time to pass wide. The question for England is will they keep their so far successful organised defence, contesting little at the breakdown to keep numbers in that white wall. If they change to the option of shooting their No13 up in a blitz ahead of their defence this may highlight some of Manu Tuilagi's defensive frailties as the role requires you to shoot out so far that you can catch the eye of the passer but are able to fall back into a drift shape and pick up you wing. Go too far and you open up holes on each side. One solution is to put Tuilagi at 12 occasionally and give the role to Brad Barritt, England's best defender. That way anyone who steps inside will meet Tuilagi and Barritt is the one to read the blitz. England did this successfully with Tuilagi and Mike Tindall in their win over Ireland in Dublin before the World Cup. If France get width they may not pose too much of a threat on the outside but they can open up the English defenders to their inside-shoulder runners. It may not be pretty but it won't be dull.",

      "bodyText": "It is not in the voice range of Matt O'Connor to make a quiet observation. The Australian coach of Leicester is to peaceful Saturdays in the East Midlands what Concorde was to tranquillity over Heathrow. When he set about reassembling the confidence of his half-backs, Ben Youngs and Toby Flood, left out of the England squad to face France on Sunday, it was not really surprising that he had the caress of a pneumatic drill. His view that England were playing not to lose rattled a pane or two, disturbing the generally clearer view so far of Stuart Lancaster's team. This obviously came as a bit of a surprise to Lee Dickson and Owen Farrell, chosen at No9 and 10 against Wales. \"He's entitled to his opinion,\" was the reply of Farrell, deemed to have had the measure of Rhys Priestland at Twickenham and who starts again at the Stade de France, with Charlie Hodgson his understudy on the bench. O'Connor's role is obviously to take players rather unceremoniously handed back to their clubs and put them back together, and the odd jibe at the national set-up is all part of the cure. Nor is everything entirely harmonious in France, with the clubs stirred into a growl by the postponement of the France-Ireland match. You don't have to travel far south of Calais to uncover club coaches not entirely fulsome in their praise of the national federation. The demotion of Youngs and Flood also coincides with the selection by another coach fresh to the international game, Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9, of a new pairing in la charni\u00e8re, Julien Dupuy and Lionel Beauxis. England lost their first game of the Six Nations, to Wales, in a thriller that generated a generally positive response until O'Connor offered his blunter appraisal. France dropped their first points in the draw against Ireland and their own coach has reignited the debate that dominated the mutinous madness of their World Cup by dropping, as Marc Li\u00e8vremont did in New Zealand, Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc. The only difference is that instead of replacing him with Morgan Parra, Saint-Andr\u00e9 drops the Clermont player to a place alongside Trinh-Duc on the bench, replacing him at scrum-half with Dupuy, not seen in the starting shirt since being banned for 23 weeks for eye-gouging Stephen Ferris. All this, and Dimitri Yachvili recovered from the back trouble that cause him to withdraw from the game(s) against Ireland. The problem at half-back in two countries still in contention for the title is not so much about the detail of accuracy as the general sense of purpose. There is no question that Dickson for England provides energy and the feeling that the tune must pop along briskly. The tempo is growing and will only increase when Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt develop an understanding in the centre, an awareness of position without having to double-check. France on occasions have swept forward from the back \u2013 something Ben Foden hasn't yet brought to the England team of 2012 \u2013 and have gone from indifferent to overpowering in seconds, as only they can. It is the scent of the half-chance in broken play that transforms them, just as Dan Carter for New Zealand goes from uninvolved to fully flowing at the merest whiff of an opening. Wesley Fofana has added a cutting edge in the French centre, lying deep but altering his angle of running at the last moment and hitting the advantage line at full tilt. Three tries in three games speak of a player who has yet to be worked out by his opponents. What France lack is a general sense of purpose in the phases that require patience. Launching Maxime M\u00e9dard, or now Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud from full-back, depends on the kicking game of the opposition, but those opportunities amount to seconds on the clock. The French forwards, by way of contrast, are supplying possession by the long minute. France have more than enough ball, but are laboured and unthreatening with much of it. Lying deep, as Fofana and M\u00e9dard have shown, can reap rich rewards, but only if at some important point the movement rapidly accelerates or changes direction. Trinh-Duc lets things come to him, rather than take the game forward. Beauxis hardly covered himself in drop-goal glory in the closing seconds of the draw with Ireland, but, again, those were the acts of micro-seconds. It is now his job to give to France the same industry from set-piece ball that Dickson injects into England. It does not have to yield instantaneous results, and faster tempo may increase the error-count on the French side, but they will be looking to their 10 to reduce the distance between the offensive and defensive lines. France are looking to explore their own sense of danger, which always brings a little tingle. It may also leave them vulnerable. England have a good chance of knocking over France on Sunday at the very point of delivery, from 10 into the midfield. As two teams seek to pump up the speed of their game, something is going to give. Noisily. And Matt O'Connor may have to hush his criticisms.",

      "bodyText": "Coach confident, but Thorpe isn't Australia's head swimming coach, Leigh Nugent, has tipped Ian Thorpe, who ended his four-year retirement last February, to cause a shock at the national trials in Adelaide by qualifying for the Games despite a string of poor performances since his comeback in Singapore in November. Thorpe , whose five gold medals make him Australia's most successful Olympian, will begin his bid on Thursday and has entered the 100m and 200m freestyle. While he is not confident about his own chances, Nugent remains optimistic. \"With someone like Ian, the history he's got and knowing his competitive capabilities, you could never write him out of the equation,\" he said. \"I've been around a long time. I've had a lot to do with Ian and with swimming at this level for almost two-and-a-half decades and with him, you've got to expect for him to pull something out of the bag. He just has that sort of ability.\" Despite Nugent's praise, the 29-year-old's best chance appears to be in the relay, with a top-six finish in the 200m making him a contender for a place in the 4x200m team \u2013 yet even that could be beyond him, given that his best time in the 200m since his return is 1min 50.79sec at the Victoria state championships in January, a time that would have left him 12th in last year's national titles. In the 100m, Australia's world champion, James Magnussen, Matt Targett, Matt Abood, James Roberts and Cameron McEvoy are all in better form than him. \"The most realistic outcome of this is that I will most likely fail,\" says Thorpe. \"All of the expectation, that desire to see me do well, it exists for me in a way that it doesn't exist for other people. It will probably be the last time I will be able to do this so I want to be able to make the most of it. I'll probably swim for at least a year or two after the Games.\" Setbacks in Belgrade Despite sending seven competitors to the European Wrestling Championships, Great Britain were left disappointed in Belgrade. The main British hope was the Commonwealth bronze medallist, Leon Rattigan, who was competing in freestyle wrestling's 96kg class, but he lost 2-0, 0-1, 0-1 to Bulgaria, while in the 66kg class Oleksandr Madyarchyk lost 0-3, 0-5 to Azerbaijan. Britain's hopes took a further blow when it emerged that Ukrainians Yana Stadnik and Olga Butkevych had failed in their attempts to get British passports in time for the Games. It is a major setback as the pair were set to be the only two females in the British team, but it now seems unlikely they will be allowed to compete.",

      "bodyText": "RED BULL Sebastian Vettel 1 Mark Webber 2 Red Bull have had the dominant car and driver for the past two years and can clearly ride another wave this season. They're the ones with the targets on their back \u2013 they have the genius of designer Adrian Newey and in Sebastian Vettel a two-time world champion on absolute peak form. They are going to be very hard to beat but with the change in regulations, it's fair to ask can Newey get it right again? If he pushes the boundaries too far, reliability might be an issue in 2012. McLAREN Jenson Button 3 Lewis Hamilton 4 McLaren have a great driver pairing and Jenson Button can be the closest challenger to Vettel, as he was in the latter half of last season. But you never know with Lewis \u2013 he has the speed and a strong car that can take on the Red Bulls. It's a clever car and they've taken a few design risks with it \u2013 plenty of smart features to eke out the car's performance, such as the blown exhaust to aid downforce. FERRARI Fernando Alonso 5 Felipe Massa 6 There's always a lot of pressure on Ferrari, more than any other team on the grid. They are still waiting for a car to pose a clear challenge but after winter testing they are in a worse situation this year going into the new season than in the previous two seasons. It's too late now to do anything other than damage limitation going into Melbourne and they will have to wait until the European races for upgrades. Massa must up his game and Alonso will be looking to improve on last year's one win. MERCEDES Michael Schumacher 7 Nico Rosberg 8 Mercedes are probably in third spot at this stage, going into the Australian Grand Prix. They have a nice, tidy car and team principal Ross Brawn clearly knows what he's doing \u2013 the Merc has the most powerful engine on the grid, and they have read the new regulations well and taken a realistic approach. And in Michael Schumacher they have a former champion who is beginning to enjoy himself back in Formula One. He may not be the driver of old but he is still ruthless and the hardest-working driver on the grid. My pick for 2012's dark horses. LOTUS Kimi Raikkonen 9 Romain Grosjean 10 It's good to see former world champion Kimi Raikkonen (left) back after his break driving rally cars. They were clearly missing Robert Kubica at the tail end of last season when he was injured. Hiring a top driver can really give a team a boost but it has yet to be seen how race rusty Kimi will be \u2013 there's always an element of doubt when a driver takes a sabbatical. They had a decent car for the first half of last season and clearly know how to design a car but perhaps lack the resources to maintain that momentum all year. FORCE INDIA Paul di Resta 11 Nico H\u00fclkenberg 12 Force India are probably behind Mercedes in terms of performance \u2013 they have a good car, realistic expectations and a strong Mercedes engine. That all adds up to possibly the surprise package on the grid \u2013 as they were last year when they were able to challenge the Mercedes works team, scoring three sixth-place finishes and scoring points at most races, which was impressive for such a small outfit. They are certainly the most improved team in Formula One and have come a long way since their days as the Spyker team back in 2007. SAUBER Kamui Kobayashi 14 Sergio P\u00e9rez 15 Sauber have been struggling a bit and although they posted some fast times in testing we've seen that from them before. They were strong in the first half of last season but did not maintain their challenge after P\u00e9rez crashed in Monaco qualifying and then had to sit out the Canadian Grand Prix. This year's Ferrari-powered car is looking a bit basic to me and it seems like a lack of funding means they will be ranked with the other smaller teams on this year's grid. In fact I would be surprised if they mounted a serious attack on the midfield pack this season. TORO ROSSO Daniel Ricciardo 16 Jean-Eric Vergne 17 They finished last season strongly so are one of the teams, like Force India, going from strength to strength. They have a great new driver pairing \u2013 you can expect fireworks between these two. Ricciardo and Vergne will be fighting for Mark Webber's Red Bull seat for next season and the pressure is on for them to deliver, to be the next Sebastian Vettel coming through, and they certainly have the most potential as any driver pairing on this season's grid. Their testing times were pretty good \u2013 so watch this space. WILLIAMS Pastor Maldonado 18 Bruno Senna 19 Williams were disappointing last year \u2013 they didn't have a fast car and scored just five points all year \u2013 and hopefully they will have a better car this season with new technical chief Mike Coughlan from McLaren making an impact. It would be so sad to see a legendary team picking up scraps again. Without the right funding levels in Formula One, however, it's difficult to spend time adapting the car to new regulations. Williams (above) hope to top the midfield pack but I've seen nothing so far to suggest a step forward from last year. CATERHAM Heikki Kovalainen 20 Vitaly Petrov 21 Tony Fernandes's rebranded team were among the first to launch their new car and are making steady progress \u2013 hopefully this year will join the tail end of the midfield pack. They did well in keeping above last year's new teams \u2013 HRT and Virigin \u2013 to score points. Certainly a driver like Heikki Kovalainen (right) will be wringing every last ounce of performance out of their tidy car and could well expect to score their first podium this year. They now have Kers on the 2012 Renault-powered car so that will aid its performance HRT Pedro de la Rosa 22 Narain Karthikeyan 23 The Spanish newcomers were late launching their new car for their second season in Formula One and so were not ready for testing \u2013 that's not the best position to be in but at least they have made it to round one, unlike last season's late start. The 2012 car doesn't look that bad but I fear it will be an uphill battle for them again this season. The experience of De la Rosa \u2013 a Spaniard with 87 grands prix under his belt \u2013 will help steer them in the right direction but only so much can be achieved on limited funding in Formula One. MARUSSIA Timo Glock 24 Charles Pic 25 A name change and new a driver in the shape of Charles Pic, fresh from GP2, but I feel sorry for the Frenchman as he will go into Melbourne without having spent any time in a Formula One car as it kept failing the pre-season crash tests. Merussia are going to be fighting just to get on the grid at Melbourne so I wouldn't expect too much at this stage. It's going to be painful watching Pic coming to terms with the car: it's impossible to start in an F1 car that is a complete unknown. Former F1 driver Anthony Davidson is Sky Sports' F1 HD analyst",

They are still waiting for a car to pose a clear challenge but after winter testing they are in a worse situation this year going into the new season than in the previous two seasons. It's too late now to do anything other than damage limitation going into Melbourne and they will have to wait until the European races for upgrades. Massa must up his game and Alonso will be looking to improve on last year's one win.</p> <h2><strong>MERCEDES </strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Schumacher </strong>7<strong> Nico Rosberg </strong>8<strong> </strong></p> <p>Mercedes are probably in third spot at this stage, going into the Australian Grand Prix. They have a nice, tidy car and team principal Ross Brawn clearly knows what he's doing \u2013 the Merc has the most powerful engine on the grid, and they have read the new regulations well and taken a realistic approach. And in Michael Schumacher they have a former champion who is beginning to enjoy himself back in Formula One. He may not be the driver of old but he is still ruthless and the hardest-working driver on the grid. My pick for 2012's dark horses.</p> <h2><strong>LOTUS</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Kimi Raikkonen </strong>9<strong> Romain Grosjean </strong>10</p> <p>It's good to see former world champion Kimi Raikkonen (left) back after his break driving rally cars. They were clearly missing Robert Kubica at the tail end of last season when he was injured. Hiring a top driver can really give a team a boost but it has yet to be seen how race rusty Kimi will be \u2013 there's always an element of doubt when a driver takes a sabbatical. They had a decent car for the first half of last season and clearly know how to design a car but perhaps lack the resources to maintain that momentum all year.</p> <h2><strong>FORCE INDIA</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Paul di Resta </strong>11<strong> Nico H\u00fclkenberg </strong>12<strong> </strong></p> <p>Force India are probably behind Mercedes in terms of performance \u2013 they have a good car, realistic expectations and a strong Mercedes engine. That all adds up to possibly the surprise package on the grid \u2013 as they were last year when they were able to challenge the Mercedes works team, scoring three sixth-place finishes and scoring points at most races, which was impressive for such a small outfit. They are certainly the most improved team in Formula One and have come a long way since their days as the Spyker team back in 2007.</p> <h2><strong>SAUBER</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Kamui Kobayashi </strong>14<strong> Sergio P\u00e9rez </strong>15<strong> </strong></p> <p>Sauber have been struggling a bit and although they posted some fast times in testing we've seen that from them before. They were strong in the first half of last season but did not maintain their challenge after P\u00e9rez crashed in Monaco qualifying and then had to sit out the Canadian Grand Prix. This year's Ferrari-powered car is looking a bit basic to me and it seems like a lack of funding means they will be ranked with the other smaller teams on this year's grid. In fact I would be surprised if they mounted a serious attack on the midfield pack this season.</p> <h2><strong>TORO ROSSO</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Daniel Ricciardo </strong>16<strong> Jean-Eric Vergne </strong>17<strong> </strong></p> <p>They finished last season strongly so are one of the teams, like Force India, going from strength to strength. They have a great new driver pairing \u2013 you can expect fireworks between these two. Ricciardo and Vergne will be fighting for Mark Webber's Red Bull seat for next season and the pressure is on for them to deliver, to be the next Sebastian Vettel coming through, and they certainly have the most potential as any driver pairing on this season's grid. Their testing times were pretty good \u2013 so watch this space.</p> <h2><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Pastor Maldonado </strong>18<strong> Bruno Senna </strong>19 <strong> </strong></p> <p>Williams were disappointing last year \u2013 they didn't have a fast car and scored just five points all year \u2013 and hopefully they will have a better car this season with new technical chief Mike Coughlan from McLaren making an impact. It would be so sad to see a legendary team picking up scraps again. Without the right funding levels in Formula One, however, it's difficult to spend time adapting the car to new regulations. Williams (above) hope to top the midfield pack but I've seen nothing so far to suggest a step forward from last year.</p> <h2><strong>CATERHAM</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Heikki Kovalainen </strong>20<strong> Vitaly Petrov </strong>21<strong> </strong></p> <p>Tony Fernandes's rebranded team were among the first to launch their new car and are making steady progress \u2013 hopefully this year will join the tail end of the midfield pack. They did well in keeping above last year's new teams \u2013 HRT and Virigin \u2013 to score points. Certainly a driver like Heikki Kovalainen (right) will be wringing every last ounce of performance out of their tidy car and could well expect to score their first podium this year. They now have Kers on the 2012 Renault-powered car so that will aid its performance</p> <h2><strong>HRT</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Pedro de la Rosa </strong>22<strong> Narain Karthikeyan </strong>23<strong> </strong></p> <p>The Spanish newcomers were late launching their new car for their second season in Formula One and so were not ready for testing \u2013 that's not the best position to be in but at least they have made it to round one, unlike last season's late start. The 2012 car doesn't look that bad but I fear it will be an uphill battle for them again this season. The experience of De la Rosa \u2013 a Spaniard with 87 grands prix under his belt \u2013 will help steer them in the right direction but only so much can be achieved on limited funding in Formula One.</p> <h2><strong>MARUSSIA</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Timo Glock </strong>24<strong> Charles Pic </strong>25<strong> </strong></p> <p>A name change and new a driver in the shape of Charles Pic, fresh from GP2, but I feel sorry for the Frenchman as he will go into Melbourne without having spent any time in a Formula One car as it kept failing the pre-season crash tests. Merussia are going to be fighting just to get on the grid at Melbourne so I wouldn't expect too much at this stage. It's going to be painful watching Pic coming to terms with the car: it's impossible to start in an F1 car that is a complete unknown.</p> <p><strong>Former F1 driver Anthony Davidson is Sky Sports' F1 HD analyst</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Stepping out on to the field for my 900th club appearance on Saturday evening, it was becoming harder than ever to escape the fact that my playing days are numbered. At 41 years old the realisation is finally beginning to hit home \u2013 I can't play football forever. At some point in the not too distant future I'm going to have to hang up my boots. The change is unimaginable. After 26 years in the game I'm as institutionalised as they come. How will I cope? The unexplained death of Gary Speed has prompted many players to speak candidly about depression following their retirement, bringing the issue into stark focus. From Dean Windass to Stan Collymore, players who were once regarded as stars suddenly find themselves lost. My generation of footballers won't become pub landlords like our predecessors, so what will we do instead? An awful lot of soul searching, I imagine. Football has been our addiction. We have lived the dream but for many it comes to an abrupt end. Last weekend, doing a bit of punditry for the BBC, Robbie Savage told me that since retiring there are days where he just doesn't know what to do with himself. Having spent our entire adult lives following orders \u2013 infantilised by the system \u2013 suddenly we have to make our own decisions, to grow up, to reintegrate back into mainstream society. On retiring many players simply disappear from public life. Where once they were lauded on TV every week, suddenly they are a nobody. It can be very hard to take. Already I have had a taste of that \u2013 from playing for England at the World Cup when it felt like the whole nation was talking about us, to playing in the Championship, a league that receives a fraction of the media coverage of the Premier League. No wonder former sports people end up on shows like Strictly Come Dancing, they miss being the centre of attention. I can't see myself ever doing one of those shows and yet it was only a few years ago that I wrote in this column about my dislike of punditry. But last weekend there I was on the BBC. I really enjoyed myself \u2013 even if the lads did hammer me for the waistcoat I was wearing. Some might wonder what footballers have to be depressed about, playing the beautiful game, earning millions of pounds (though not all of us do), but while it is a wonderful way to earn a living, football is not real life and even if we try to remain in the game \u2013 through management or punditry \u2013 we can't escape the real world forever. So what do I mean by institutionalised? Well, at 41 I'm pretty childish. I remember the record producer Pete Waterman once saying that as soon as a boy band tell you they want to write their own songs you know they're finished. Football is no different. Players remain juvenile well into their late 20s and 30s. It suits the industry to keep us that way. And the longer you stay in the industry, the deeper that goes. Football has been everything to us. It rules our home lives. We live for the highs \u2013 a man-of-the-match performance watched by millions on live TV \u2013 and crumble at the lows, a never-ending oscillation between extreme emotional states. It affects our relationships with our partners, children, friends and colleagues. In my 26 years of professional football I've been a nightmare to be around. At Liverpool I'd come off the field after winning 3-1 and be in a terrible mood because I had conceded a goal. Anyone who came near me after a defeat \u2013 strewth, it bothers me how horrible I used to be. The game puts a great deal of strain on those around you. Children in particular suffer. In my own life I gave much more to football than I did to being a father. Whether it was mood swings affecting the atmosphere at home, or just physically not being there \u2013 travelling to away games, training camps, pre-season tours, training on Christmas Day. When you retire, suddenly you are forced to pick up the pieces. You have to become a real dad, a real husband, a real son. No one warns you that this will happen and who do you turn to for help? You could be the richest retired footballer in the world but you can't pay someone to sort out your family for you. There is a misconception that all footballers are very confident, but it is the opposite for most. While as individuals we are often put in a position of prestige, our power in real terms is pretty limited. No wonder so many young players go off the rails. Idolised as God's gift in one sphere, within the workplace they are expected to bow down to the authority of the club. It is a strange and confusing dynamic, forever in conflict. It is no coincidence that footballers tend to be extremely insecure. We feed off praise, and it is a harsh reality check when you realise that most people around you are feeding you absolute rubbish. It is a great irony that in a game where we routinely talk about confidence on the pitch, psychological support off it is so appallingly neglected. Many years ago when I was going through a bad time at Liverpool I approached the club for some support. Back then I was told, \"shut up and deal with it\". Sadly, I don't think that football has moved on from that position. Even when clubs are forward thinking enough to invite a sports psychologist into the fold players are apprehensive about making use of them. They are too worried about what their team-mates and management will think. \"Will everyone think I'm mad?\" \"What if he tells the manager about me?\" \"What if it jeopardises my position in the team?\" I always say it: we have nutritionists to help with our diets, sports scientists to help our strength and conditioning, technical coaches to help our performance but the one area that essentially determines everything \u2013 psychology \u2013 is always missing. Ask about a psychology coach and you are guaranteed to be met with a frown. Our industry is crying out for an independent support network to help current and former players deal with the pressures of the game. Until then I'll probably put off retirement for a while yet. At least until I reach 1,000 club appearances. David James has donated his fee for this column to charity",

      "bodyText": "Michael Scott, the performance director for British swimming, has reiterated his belief that Team GB can win more medals in the pool at London 2012 than was achieved at the Beijing Olympics four years ago. Speaking after Saturday's culmination of the British Gas Swimming Championships, which was also an eight-day trial for those hoping to make Team GB, as well as a test event for this summer's Olympic venue, Scott conceded the target of six medals he has set for this summer's Games represented a \"significant challenge\", but having now seen 38 swimmers, 19 men and 19 women, qualify for the final party, he remains adamant that it is an achievable aim. Britain won six swimming medals in Beijing, the country's best Olympic haul in 100 years. But repeating that feat will be tougher as, this time around, Team GB can select only two swimmers in the open water events \u2013 in which three medals were won in 2008 \u2013 meaning more will have to be secured in the pool. \"For Britain to win medals in any sport is tough because the Olympics are now a truly global competition, with more and more athletes helping to raise the standards across the board,\" said the Australia-born Scott, who was appointed performance director in September 2007. \"It is part of my job to set targets and [winning six medals] represents a significant challenge. But collectively we have the time and opportunity to improve to make sure we are as competitive as possible for when the rest of the world arrives in London in July.\" Within the 38 swimmers who have made Team GB, there are four who have won Olympic medals \u2013 Rebecca Adlington, who took gold in the 400 metres and 800m freestyle in Beijing, Jo Jackson, who took bronze in the same 400m freestyle race, David Davies, who won silver in the 10km open water event in China, and Keri-Ann Payne, who did the same in the women's event and became the first British swimmer to qualify for London 2012 when she won gold at last summer's world championships. Payne is one of 12 swimmers within the 38 presented here on Saturday who have world championship medals, while there are 20 who hold British records. There are also a couple of world record holders, including Adlington, whose time of 8min 14.10sec set in the 800m freestyle final in Beijing has yet to be surpassed. In total, 28 swimmers (12 men and 16 women) qualified for individual events during these championships, with Joe Roebuck and Fran Halsall achieving places in three different individual Olympic disciplines. Among the rest, there were also notable landmarks, with those among the men particularly encouraging given their paucity of success in recent years \u2014 of the six medals Britain won at the 2011 world championships only one was achieved by a male swimmer; Liam Tancock's gold in the 50m breaststroke, an event that is not part of this year's Olympic roster. Here, Roberto Pavoni swam the fastest time in the world in 2012 when he took gold in the 400m individual medley final (4:12.43), while Roebuck did the same in winning the 200m butterfly (1:55.94). Andrew Willis, meanwhile, set a new English record time when winning the 200m breaststroke (2:09.33). The women also impressed \u2013 Hannah Miley posted the world's best time this year when taking gold in the 400m individual medley (4:32.67), while Ellen Gandy set a new British record time when she won the 100m butterfly (57.25). Rebecca Turner also became only the fifth British woman in history to swim under one minute 58 seconds when she recorded a time of 1.57.65 in the 200m freestyle, while Adlington's time of 4:02.35 in the 400m freestyle final was the fastest in the world this year. Her time of 8:18.54 in the 800m freestyle final was her quickest since winning gold in Shanghai. \"The remarkable strength and depth of British talent within the sport of swimming has been on display throughout the past week,\" said Andy Hunt, Team GB's chef de mission. \"Team GB enjoys a proud tradition in Olympic swimming and I'm sure the class of 2012 will produce some thrilling moments in the competition this summer.\" There are 52 places available for swimmers in Team GB. For those who failed to make the qualifying times here, a last chance presents itself at June's ASA Championships in Sheffield. Based on performances here, Scott believes Britain can realistically qualify 47 swimmers for the Olympics; 45 in the pool and two in the open water.",

But collectively we have the time and opportunity to improve to make sure we are as competitive as possible for when the rest of the world arrives in London in July.\"</p> <p>Within the 38 swimmers who have made Team GB, there are four who have won Olympic medals \u2013 Rebecca Adlington, who took gold in the 400 metres and 800m freestyle in Beijing, Jo Jackson, who took bronze in the same 400m freestyle race, David Davies, who won silver in the 10km open water event in China, and Keri-Ann Payne, who did the same in the women's event and became the first British swimmer to qualify for London 2012 when she won gold at last summer's world championships.</p> <p>Payne is one of 12 swimmers within the 38 presented here on Saturday who have world championship medals, while there are 20 who hold British records. There are also a couple of world record holders, including Adlington, whose time of 8min 14.10sec set in the 800m freestyle final in Beijing has yet to be surpassed.</p> <p>In total, 28 swimmers (12 men and 16 women) qualified for individual events during these championships, with Joe Roebuck and Fran Halsall achieving places in three different individual Olympic disciplines. Among the rest, there were also notable landmarks, with those among the men particularly encouraging given their paucity of success in recent years \u2014 of the six medals Britain won at the 2011 world championships only one was achieved by a male swimmer; Liam Tancock's gold in the 50m breaststroke, an event that is not part of this year's Olympic roster. Here, Roberto Pavoni swam the fastest time in the world in 2012 when he took gold in the 400m individual medley final (4:12.43), while Roebuck did the same in winning the 200m butterfly (1:55.94). Andrew Willis, meanwhile, set a new English record time when winning the 200m breaststroke (2:09.33).</p> <p>The women also impressed \u2013 Hannah Miley posted the world's best time this year when taking gold in the 400m individual medley (4:32.67), while Ellen Gandy set a new British record time when she won the 100m butterfly (57.25). Rebecca Turner also became only the fifth British woman in history to swim under one minute 58 seconds when she recorded a time of 1.57.65 in the 200m freestyle, while Adlington's time of 4:02.35 in the 400m freestyle final was the fastest in the world this year. Her time of 8:18.54 in the 800m freestyle final was her quickest since winning gold in Shanghai.</p> <p>\"The remarkable strength and depth of British talent within the sport of swimming has been on display throughout the past week,\" said Andy Hunt, Team GB's chef de mission.</p> <p>\"Team GB enjoys a proud tradition in Olympic swimming and I'm sure the class of 2012 will produce some thrilling moments in the competition this summer.\"</p> <p>There are 52 places available for swimmers in Team GB. For those who failed to make the qualifying times here, a last chance presents itself at June's ASA Championships in Sheffield. Based on performances here, Scott believes Britain can realistically qualify 47 swimmers for the Olympics; 45 in the pool and two in the open water.</p>",

Gatlin served a four-year ban himself after testing positive for excessive testosterone in 2006, but unlike Chambers he is not subject to an Olympic ban. \"Dwain has proven himself as a God-given talent and a good runner and having him on the line in the Olympics would make a great show,\" Gatlin said. The American won in 6.46sec, ahead of Nesta Carter and Chambers, who took bronze in 6.60. On Monday, the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) will start a hearing into the dispute between the World Anti-Doping Agency and the British Olympic Association over the validity of the BOA bylaw that stops Chambers from even trying to qualify for the Olympics. If Cas decides in Wada's favour, Chambers will get the chance to compete alongside Gatlin in London this summer. Chambers and Gatlin made an unusual pair in the post-race press conference. The Briton has admitted his guilt but Gatlin has always insisted his failed test was due to a masseur rubbing testosterone cream on to his skin. \"We have both made mistakes and we have been blessed with the opportunity to get back,\" Chambers said. \"We are trying to get back to the true essence of sport: now and that is running. \"I am living proof that you can make mistakes and get yourself back on the straight and narrow. Every time I get the opportunity to compete for my country it is an honour, and I threw that away. That vision scared me, so I never ever want throw that away again.\" Chambers's agent, the barrister Siza Agha, said the result in Istanbul was not surprising, because \"Gatlin has the support of the US and Dwain doesn't have the support of his own federation. Those responsible are doing a disservice to Dwain, the public and the country.\" \"The more we keep talking about the past the more we are going to keep the sport in a bad light,\" Chambers said. \"It is important that we start looking forward and hopefully we can look forward to a fantastic Olympic Games.\" He will have to wait and see whether he will be part of it.",

Losing 1-0 at Everton on Saturday left the Tottenham Hotspur manager looking at a run of three consecutive defeats for the first time in his White Hart Lane career, though typically Redknapp sought to make light of it. \"I'm suicidal really,\" he joked. \"We've just lost three in a row and two of the games we deserved to win. We played very well against Manchester United last week, but even more so here, I just couldn't see how we lost the game. From the first whistle of the second half to the last we absolutely battered Everton, but we just couldn't get a break in front of goal.\" Spurs' best chance of securing a point came in stoppage time when Louis Saha hit a post from close range, exasperating the travelling support but not really surprising the Everton fans. \"I couldn't have asked any more of the players against United, and we couldn't have played any better than we did in the second half against Everton,\" Redknapp said. \"Everton are a hard-working side, everybody knows that, but for the last 45 minutes we actually worked harder. We were excellent, we kept them penned in the whole time, but it was just one of those days in the end. The ball wouldn't go in.\" The sudden Spurs stall means that Arsenal can get to within a point of their rivals by beating Newcastle at home on Monday, after weeks when it looked certain Tottenham would claim the highest finish by a London team. \"I said all along that a 10-point lead can evaporate very quickly,\" Redknapp said. \"It certainly can when you have three games in a row against Arsenal, United and Everton. We've had some tough games, but we are still in a better position than the others.\" Redknapp was criticised by sections of his own support for playing Gareth Bale on the right, though he countered that he plays there for Wales and thought it important to try to keep Leighton Baines pinned back. At least David Moyes, a possible contender to fill any imminent managerial vacancy at Spurs, was willing to offer some support. \"Spurs played really well and we rode our luck at times,\" the Everton manager said. \"I would say that was as good a visiting performance as we have seen at Goodison all season.\"",

Maybe you have not come from such a great race, but this is a new year, a new chapter and a new chance ahead. It is an exciting time.\" There were times last season when the McLaren driver appeared to be driving the world's fastest psychiatrist's couch. There were highs \u2013 brilliant drives in China, Germany and Abu Dhabi \u2013 but they were overshadowed by the lows, when anxieties crowded in and his running spat with Ferrari's Felipe Massa drove his title bid off the rails. Then \u2013 as Massa and Kamui Kobayashi, among others, would confirm \u2013 he was about as dangerous a rival as Messala, in Ben-Hur, who drove his chariot with blades on the hubs to destroy the opposition, but succeeded only in destroying himself. This campaign, Hamilton says, will be different, however. Last year, conversation about Hamilton centred on his on-off relationship with his girlfriend, on his professionally estranged father and the people he brought in to manage him. He does not want to dwell on personal issues. \"I'm looking forwards,\" he says. \"This year I have focused on my relationship with the team, my mechanics and my group of people who I have put together, and making sure I am fit and healthy. This is what matters. Last year has no bearing on me. I don't care about last year.\" Despite talk of a revitalised Michael Schumacher and Mark Webber, of Fernando Alonso's brooding greatness and of the serenity of his team-mate, Jenson Button, Hamilton is arguably the most likely man to deprive Sebastian Vettel of a hat-trick of championships. He just may have the car. He certainly has the ability and this year, most important of all, he appears to have the resolve to do the job and add to his 2008 world title. \"You have to keep your eye on the ball and stay focused during training and not waste energy. I was massively disciplined in 2006 and 2007. It is not necessarily that I lost that discipline, but now it's back more to what it used to be. It is all about sacrifices. It is about the travelling you do and the decisions you make, and the things you want to do with your life.\" Hamilton then outlines what he, a millionaire Formula One driver, considers a sacrifice. \"I sacrifice things, like if I get a call from a friend who says: 'Do you want to go out tonight?' and it is before a race weekend or when the season starts, instead of saying: 'Yeah, let's go out and do it,' I'll be staying at home and training the next day. \"That's the sacrifice you need to make in Formula One. Last year there were quite a few times when I went out and enjoyed myself, thinking: 'These things don't affect you.' But they do. It takes two days to recover and then you have missed two days of training, and your thoughts are somewhere else after that.\" Hamilton denies that he was also affected last year when his fellow Briton Button became his first McLaren team-mate to beat him over the course of a season. \"It didn't bother me. If it was a case that we had both been very close over the year and I had lost it when it was fiercely competitive, I guess it would have been quite tough. \"But it was a year where I was throwing away points and making silly mistakes. Sometimes I was a little unfortunate, but it was a shocking year and I was not too devastated by it. \"You have to draw a line under it. At the end of the day, he did not win the world championship. If he had it would have been even worse. But there are still many years ahead and I do not plan on that being the case this year. \"I am in a good place \u2013 and Vettel is not invincible.\"",

      "bodyText": "The number of police dealing with 999 emergencies has fallen by more than 5,000 since the last general election, according to new figures that seriously undermine David Cameron's pledge to be defending \"frontline\" forces from spending cuts. The figures, compiled from responses to freedom of information requests from all 43 forces in England and Wales, are a severe embarrassment to the government, which has insisted that its 20% funding cuts will not compromise public safety or the fight against crime. Labour described the job losses among so-called \"first responders\" \u2013 those following up on 999 calls \u2013 as \"shocking\" and said they raised new questions about whether the public could trust the government. Only last month Cameron told the Commons that the percentage of frontline officers was actually increasing. Ministers have claimed more officers are being switched to the \"sharp end\" as back office jobs go and police bureaucracy is reduced. But the new data, supplied by the forces themselves and verified independently by the House of Commons library, shows a fall of 5,261 in the number of officers defined as \"first responders\" between March 2010 and December last year. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary defines \"first responders\" as those responding to 999 calls, attending traffic accidents and being first at the scenes of crime and other incidents such as public disturbances. Of the 43 forces, 23 have so far only submitted figures up to March last year in their FOI responses, meaning that, when all the figures are in, the total is likely to be significantly higher. Among forces that have suffered the biggest culls of 999 officers are Devon and Cornwall, which lost 540 \"first responders\" (25% of its total), and West Midlands, which lost 1,023 (19%). Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation, which represents 135,000 officers, said the impact of the cuts would raise questions about the police's ability to contain events such as last summer's riots. \"It puts more pressure on those who are left. In particular, those involved in responding are stretched and it puts their safety on the line,\" he said. \"It also impinges on the public's safety. We keep getting the same mantra from government, that it wants to concentrate on crime, that it's a core responsibility, and that's sending one message to the public. The message is that they expect us to do everything, which cannot be right. We have to acknowledge that, with cuts of between 20% and 32%, we cannot do more with that much less.\" Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, whose office made the freedom of information requests, said: \"Time and again the government has promised us the frontline will not be cut but now we see very clear proof that the very officers that need to respond to 999 calls, that need to respond to emergency incidents, are disappearing. To lose thousands of the very officers that you need in an emergency will be deeply worrying for people right across the country. People need to know that the police will be there when they need them.\" A Home Office spokesman said: \"These are not official figures and we don't recognise them. The reality is independent reports have shown police can reduce costs while protecting the frontline and, according to official statistics and police plans, the proportion of officers on the frontline is rising. \"We've reversed the policies of the past to get police out of back-office roles and back on the streets. Official figures show that since March 2010 we've seen 500 more officers on the frontline as work is done across all 43 forces to reduce the more than 23,500 warranted police officers in backroom posts.\" The FOI submissions are certain to catapult the issue of policing and crime to the top of the political agenda, after the latest British Crime Survey figures showed personal crime \u2013 including theft, robbery and violence \u2013 had gone up by 11% since last year, the steepest rise for more than a decade. The home affairs select committee raised concerns last year about the effects that \u00a32bn of cuts a year would have on the service and on crime levels. The committee also raised concerns that the biggest savings were to be made in 2012-3 \u2013 when police authorities would be replaced with police and crime commissioners, and when there would be additional pressure on forces nationwide due to the 2012 Olympics. Last year the police minister, Nick Herbert, said: \"We believe that by controlling costs, cutting bureaucracy, making savings in force back and middle offices, and improving productivity, the police service for the public can be maintained and improved even as funding is reduced.\" Other ministers have repeatedly said that crime and police effectiveness \"do not depend on numbers\". Cooper said that policing could well become as big a political crisis for the government in the runup to the next election as the NHS. Like the NHS, the government was about to impose massive and unwelcome reform on a service that the public believed had improved, even at a time of massive spending cuts.",

      "bodyText": "A few days before the 2010 general election, David Cameron was discussing the effects that spending cuts would have on government departments if the Tories came to power. The NHS budget, he said, would be protected, as would international aid. Elsewhere things would be tough and the cuts would bite hard. Cameron was, however, able to offer reassurances about the future of public services, including the police. \"What I can tell you is \u2026 if I win the election, if we win the election, [any cabinet minister] who comes to me and says, 'Here are my plans' and they involve frontline reductions, they'll be sent straight back to their department to go away and think again.\" Just six weeks ago, the prime minister delivered a similar message in the House of Commons in answer to a question from the Labour MP Paul Farrelly, who complained that in his Staffordshire constituency of Newcastle-under-Lyme the police force was on a \"cliff edge\", with numbers falling to their lowest in a decade. Again, Cameron felt able to reassure him. \"The fact is that the percentage of officers on the frontline has actually increased,\" he said. Figures revealed by the Observer, obtained using freedom of information requests to all 43 police forces in England and Wales, suggest something altogether different. In recent months it has been shown that the jobs of several thousand frontline officers \u2013 those who deal with the public rather than operate behind the scenes \u2013 have been lost as forces undertake the task of imposing the 20% of cost savings that have to be made by 2014-15. But these latest figures are even more damaging to the Cameron defence. They have been independently verified by the House of Commons library and show that up to December last year, after 19 months of coalition government, 5,261 \"first responder\" posts \u2013 those who are not just \"frontline\" but are at the very sharp end, responding to 999 emergencies \u2013 had been lost. In several forces the percentage of losses has been well above 10%, and in Devon and Cornwall it is 25% of the total. The data is not yet complete and the total is certain to be higher now than at the end of last year. The figures will have several effects. Certainly they will catapult the issue of crime and policing back to the top of the political agenda. Ministers can no longer say black is white and escape the reality through obfuscation. Their problem is not just that there is strong data showing the frontline is suffering. It is also that after years in which crime declined \u2013 during Labour's period in power it fell substantially \u2013 there are now signs that it is starting to rise again. In January, figures from the British Crime Survey showed that personal crime, including theft, robbery and violence, had gone up by 11% over the last year \u2013 the steepest increase for more than a decade. The chief constable of Gloucestershire has warned of a \"perfect storm\" for his force as police numbers are cut, economic austerity bites, and the government imposes sweeping reforms, including the transition to elected police commissioners in November. David Green, the director of the Civitas thinktank, said a link between falling police numbers and rising crime could reasonably be made. \"Not all crime is equally susceptible to variations in police presence or activity, but crime that occurs in public places, including theft from the person and all violence, varies a good deal with the visibility of the police. Drunken fights, for example, might go no further than an unseemly scuffle if the police are near at hand, but may turn into stabbings or serious beatings without police intervention. \"The last Labour government was committed to neighbourhood policing and was beginning to make a reality of it. The coalition remains formally committed, but without the officers to carry out foot patrols its declared aims cannot be fully realised.\" A perfect storm does indeed seem to be brewing for the government. Hard economic times are likely to increase certain types of personal, acquisitive crime. Richard Muir, from the IPPR thinktank, said the view among experts was that the period of falling crime might well be over: \"Despite the government's claim that crime is simply fluctuating, it looks increasingly likely that we are at the start of an upward trend. This is to be expected given the rise in youth unemployment, although it has taken time to feed through into a higher crime rate. There is always something of a lag between the start of an economic downturn and a rise in crime, but the rise in personal acquisitive crime shows that this is now feeding through.\" The result could be that the Conservatives' reputation as the party of law and order may be under threat, as could the party's relationship with the police service. Muir said: \"The government is in a vulnerable position on crime in part because of its deteriorating relationship with the police service. \"It has alienated the Police Federation through a combination of job cuts, a pay freeze and pension reform, while it has alienated the chief constables by introducing elected police and crime commissioners. So, as crime rises, we may find the police putting the blame at the government's door.\" It may also be that the Tories' (and Liberal Democrats') problem could well work to Labour's advantage. Cameron's pledge to protect frontline policing is now hard to sustain. As with his pledge to avoid any \"top-down\" reorganisation of the NHS, and not to meddle with child benefit, a promise appears to have been broken. For Labour, the opportunity is growing to portray the coalition government as one whose leaders say one thing and do another. The issue of trust is becoming a difficult one for Cameron. Ed Miliband and his shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, may find that crime and policing becomes as fruitful an area in the coming months and years as the NHS already is. The parallels are there. As with the NHS, Labour can accuse the government of meddling with a public service that most people believed was working and that was showing good results. It can accuse the coalition of trying to impose reform at the same time as inflicting massive spending cuts \u2013 an impossible mix. Labour agrees that police spending needs to be cut, but by 12% rather than 20%, allowing the frontline to be protected. In short, it believes that police and crime could become the \"new NHS\", politically and in terms of public opinion. It intends to campaign hard on the issue ahead of the May local authority and London mayoral elections. With the Olympics approaching, the dangers for the government are obvious. Cooper noted many parallels with the NHS as an issue, although she said concern over policing and crime would take longer to build as the evidence stacked up over time. \"People rely on the police just as they rely on the NHS. They want to know that the police will be there at a time of need, just as they want to know the NHS will be there at a time of need.\" Arguments over the health and social care bill have already done much to revive Labour's morale and may explain some recent improvements in the party's position in the polls relative to the Tories. Will crime and policing \u2013 traditionally a strong suit for the Tories \u2013 become another issue that damages Cameron and his party and has the reverse effect on Labour?",

Especially after his humble thoughts in midweek, when he revealed he had dreamt of being Ireland captain since childhood. If only his surname lent itself to a snappy headline \u2026 PUNDIT OF THE DAY The BBC's Martin Castrogiovanni remains a beguiling presence on screen, an Italian man mountain tamed only by having to squeeze into a suit. His pitch-side colleague in Cardiff on Saturday, Jason Mohammad, had a lively afternoon as his minder, describing him as \"itching to get on the pitch\" and then \"banging the desk\" when the action began. STAT OF THE DAY We knew Italy would have their work cut out defending against Wales, but the tackle count was quite extraordinary. Wales made 62. Italy 112. QUIRKWATCH The Beeb's pre-match buildup rarely leaves a nearby street untouched by a film crew on a quirky mission. On Saturday we went out and about in Dublin and Cardiff. Keith Wood and Andy Nicol got ready for the city's St Patrick's festival by donning costumes while John Inverdale received, on cue, a peck on the cheek from an Italian fan. Who writes these scripts? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"As long as we don't make any advertisements like last year. We're not as dumb as that.\" Warren Gatland is obviously not using the England 2011 template as Wales go in search of a grand slam. A Nike ad proclaiming England \"Grand Slam Champions 2011\" was leaked after their final-day defeat in Dublin.

      "body": "<h2>MAN OF THE DAY</h2> <p>Good to see Ireland's stand-in captain <strong>Rory Best</strong> lead from the front, score the first try and generally do everything right in the win against Scotland. Especially after his humble thoughts in midweek, when he revealed he had dreamt of being Ireland captain since childhood. If only his surname lent itself to a snappy headline \u2026</p> <h2>PUNDIT OF THE DAY</h2> <p>The BBC's<strong> Martin Castrogiovanni </strong>remains a beguiling presence on screen, an Italian man mountain tamed only by having to squeeze into a suit. His pitch-side colleague in Cardiff on Saturday, Jason Mohammad, had a lively afternoon as his minder, describing him as \"itching to get on the pitch\" and then \"banging the desk\" when the action&#xa0;began.</p> <h2>STAT OF THE DAY</h2> <p>We knew Italy would have their work cut out defending against Wales, but the <strong>tackle count</strong> was quite extraordinary. Wales made 62. Italy 112.</p> <h2>QUIRKWATCH</h2> <p>The Beeb's pre-match buildup rarely leaves a nearby street untouched by a film crew on a <strong>quirky mission</strong>. On Saturday we went out and about in Dublin and Cardiff. Keith Wood and Andy Nicol got ready for the city's St&#xa0;Patrick's festival by donning costumes while John Inverdale received, on cue, a peck on the cheek from an Italian fan. Who writes these scripts?</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"As long as we don't make any advertisements like last year. We're not as dumb as that.\" <strong>Warren Gatland</strong> is obviously not using the England 2011 template as Wales go in search of a grand slam. A Nike ad proclaiming England \"Grand Slam Champions 2011\" was leaked after their final-day defeat in Dublin.</p> <h2>COMEDY CENTRAL</h2> <p>Gabby Logan helmed coverage from Dublin with her usual unruffled style \u2013 even in those eye-catching black leather gloves \u2013 but there was <strong>hidden turmoil</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum easily won the Kansas caucuses to consolidate his status as the main challenger to front-runner Mitt Romney and to dispel any lingering hopes of an early conclusion to the race. The scale of his victory highlighted his hold on the party's conservative base, especially in the Midwest, and its lack of enthusiasm for Romney. The victory boosts Santorum going into next Tuesday's contests in Mississippi and Alabama. Romney had hoped the contest would be over by now but Santorum is stubbornly clinging on and, as long as he keeps picking up states such as Kansas, there is no incentive for him to quit. Santorum adds Kansas to wins in Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Oklahoma and North Dakota and is almost certain to take Missouri next Saturday. With half the votes counted, the Associated Press called the result for Santorum. As a small compensation for the loss of Kansas, Romney won three other Republican contests: the US Virgin Islands and two in the Pacific, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. They have a combined total of 21 delegates, all of which went to Romney. Kansas had 40 delegates at stake. A candidate needs 1,144 delegates to the Republican convention in August to secure the party nomination to take on Barack Obama for the White House in November. Romney has opened up a big delegate lead but is still far short of a winning total. According to the Associated Press, Romney has 441 delegates, including those from Guam, the Marianas and the Virgin Islands. Santorum had 183 before the Kansas delegates were awarded. Gingrich has 107 and Ron Paul 46. Romney sent one of his sons, Matt, to Guam to campaign on his behalf. \"I am grateful to have won all nine delegates in Guam, and I am pleased that my son Matt was able to visit the island on my behalf and be there for the caucuses,\" Romney said in one statement. Neither Romney or Gingrich campaigned aggressively in Kansas, having concluded last week that Santorum was going to win. Gingrich cancelled planned campaign events in Kansas on Friday to concentrate instead on Mississippi and Alabama. Santorum is hoping that Gingrich might pull out off the race if he fails to win Mississippi or Alabama, allowing him to head-to-head with Romney. Paul so far has failed to win a single state but said he intends staying in the race.",

      "bodyText": "After winning Thursday's 100 metres freestyle final Fran Halsall revealed she had worn a pink swimsuit for the race, in which she also set the quickest time in the world this year, so her dad could spot her from up in the stands. For Saturday night's 50m freestyle final she was back in all black, but the final outcome was just as stunning, with the 21-year-old recording a season-best's time to become the only British female swimmer to have qualified for the London Games in three individual Olympic disciplines. Halsall touched home in 24.13sec, shaving five-hundredths of a second off her previous best finish this year and within a fingertip of her British record time of 24.11, and faster than the time of 24.14 set by Sweden's Therese Alshammar upon winning the world title in Shanghai last summer. Such was the blistering nature of Halsall's display that it left the Commonwealth silver medallist, who has also qualified for London 2012 in the 100m butterfly, as well as 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays, \"speechless\", a rarity for a woman who describes herself as \"70% athlete, 20% Krispy Kreme addict and 10% rock star\". Halsall said: \"I knew coming into this race that I was in good shape and could swim fast, but to go that quick has blown me away. I'm so happy, especially as I know there is more to come from me \u2013 this is the fastest I have ever been in March so all I need to do is keep that momentum going. I'm full of confidence for the summer. I'll have three individual [races] and two relays to focus on, meaning I'll be busy. But it's good, it'll keep me out of trouble.\" Amy Smith took silver in a personal best time of 24.80, meaning the 24-year-old will compete at the Olympics in two events having already secured a place in the 100m freestyle. Meanwhile, in the last race of what was the final day of the British Gas Swimming Championships, there was something of a shock as Daniel Fogg took gold in the 1500m freestyle final in a time of 14min 55.30, beating David Davies, the 2004 Olympic bronze medallist, into second place by almost six seconds. The pair were neck and neck up until the split but then Fogg, the 2010 Commonwealth bronze medallist, pulled away to record a personal best time and an English record. Both men, however, swam quick enough to make Team GB, with Davies, who won silver in the 10km marathon in Beijing four years ago, heading for his third Olympics. Fogg and Davies make it 28 swimmers (12 men and 16 women) who qualified for individual Olympic places during these eight-day trials. For those who failed here, a last chance to fill Team GB's 52 spots for the Games presents itself at June's ASA Championships in Sheffield. Whoever does make the final party will be under pressure to meet the target set by British swimming's performance director, Michael Scott, of winning six medals at the Games, the same number as they achieved in Beijing four years ago \u2013 which was the country's best Olympic haul in 100 years \u2013 and at last summer's world championships. The task is even tougher this time around given Team GB can only select two swimmers in the open water events \u2013 in which three medals were won in 2008 \u2013 meaning more medals will have to be won in the pool, but confidence can be taken from many of performances over the past week. For the men, for instance, Roberto Pavoni swam the fastest time in the world this year when he took gold in the 400m individual medley final (4min 12.43sec), while Joe Roebuck did the same in winning the 200m butterfly (1:55.94). Andrew Willis, meanwhile, set a new English record time when winning the 200m breaststroke (2:09.33). The women, who captured five of Britain's six medals at the world championships, have also impressed \u2013 Hannah Miley posted the world's best time upon taking gold in the 400m individual medley (4:32.67), while Ellen Gandy set a new British record time when she won the 100m butterfly (57.25). Rebecca Turner also became only the fifth British woman in history to swim under 1 minute 58 when she recorded a time of 1.57.65 in the 200m freestyle. And then, of course, there is Rebecca Adlington, whose time of 4:2.35 in the 400m freestyle final was the fastest in the world this year while her time of 8:18.54 in the 800m freestyle final was her quickest since winning the gold medal in Shanghai.",

      "bodyText": "As unprecedented security plans are drawn up to safeguard the centrepiece of the Damien Hirst show at Tate Modern, his \u00a350m diamond skull sculpture For the Love of God, the artist has revealed his hopes for a public gallery he will open in south London in 2014. \"It's my Saatchi gallery, basically,\" Hirst told the Observer, describing the development project in Lambeth that will soon display the highlights of his personal collection of more than 2,000 artworks. \"It's about as big as the Whitechapel \u2013 six galleries, a caf\u00e9 and a shop \u2013 and it's a place to show my collection of contemporary art. It feels bad having it all in crates. It's basically Bacon and beyond,\" said the artist. He added that he had five paintings by the late Francis Bacon. \"Which is great. He didn't make many and he's not making any more.\" The collection also includes works by US artist Jeff Koons, Hirst's fellow Young British Artist star Sarah Lucas, and graffiti artist, Banksy. Designed by New Art Gallery Walsall architect Caruso St John for Hirst's company Science Ltd, the gallery will be housed inside a long terrace of listed buildings, formerly used as theatre carpentry and scenery production workshops, and will be flanked by new buildings. The ground and upper floors of the listed buildings will be linked to allow the space to be used for both small and large exhibitions and the plans include office rooms for Hirst himself and a restaurant. This month the artist has also applied for permission to put his own money into building 500 new eco-homes near his house in north Devon. Hirst's infamous platinum and diamond skull, made for him with materials worth \u00a314m over 18 months by Bentley and Skinner of Bond Street, the jewellers who made the imperial state crown that is worn by the Queen for the state opening of parliament [see footnote], will be displayed for free in Tate Modern's echoing Turbine Hall from 4 April inside a special viewing room. It will be protected by the kind of security usually deployed around masterpieces such as Picasso's Guernica or a religious relic such as the Turin shroud, and uniformed guards will be stationed around the work. The skull has not been seen in this country since 2007, when it was sold to a consortium that included the artist, but it has recently drawn crowds in Florence and Amsterdam. The platinum cast of a human skull is encrusted with 8,601 pave-set diamonds weighing 1,106.18 carats, including a flawless, pink, pear-shaped diamond in the middle of the forehead. The cast's jaw is adorned with the skull's original teeth. \"I started thinking how, here in England, or the western world for that matter, we're obsessed with skulls and yet we avoid confronting death,\" the artist has explained. Although there have been Hirst retrospectives in Naples and Monaco, this will be the first solo show in a major British institution \u2013 one in which the artist swore he would never show his work. It will be, Hirst explained, \"a map of my life as an artist, not a greatest hits\". Nevertheless the show is to include the first \"spot\" painting, the first \"spin\" painting and the first medicine cabinet, along with the controversial shark in formaldehyde and Mother and Child Divided (1993), the installation featuring a bisected cow and calf suspended in four tanks. Outside the gallery, Hymn, the artist's huge statue based on a child's educational anatomical model, will expose its internal organs to the Thames. \u2022 The following correction was published on 18 March 2012: \"Damien Hirst plans 'Saatchi moment' (News) described plans to display the artist's \u00a350m platinum and diamond skull at Tate Modern and said it was made for him by Bentley and Skinner of Bond Street, \"the jewellers who made the imperial state crown\". While they are by royal appointment, Bentley and Skinner did not make the crown. It was remade by Garrard in 1937, using 3,000 gems transferred from an earlier crown.",

It feels bad having it all in crates. It's basically Bacon and beyond,\" said the artist.</p> <p>He added that he had five paintings by the late Francis Bacon. \"Which is great. He didn't make many and he's not making any more.\"</p> <p>The collection also includes works by US artist Jeff Koons, Hirst's fellow Young British Artist star Sarah Lucas, and graffiti artist, Banksy.</p> <p>Designed by New Art Gallery Walsall architect Caruso St John for Hirst's company Science Ltd, the gallery will be housed inside a long terrace of listed buildings, formerly used as theatre carpentry and scenery production workshops, and will be flanked by new buildings.</p> <p>The ground and upper floors of the listed buildings will be linked to allow the space to be used for both small and large exhibitions and the plans include office rooms for Hirst himself and a restaurant.</p> <p>This month the artist has also applied for permission to put his own money into building 500 new eco-homes near his house in north Devon.</p> <p>Hirst's infamous platinum and diamond skull, made for him with materials worth \u00a314m over 18 months by Bentley and Skinner of Bond Street, the jewellers who made the imperial state crown that is worn by the Queen for the state opening of parliament [see footnote], will be displayed for free in Tate Modern's echoing Turbine Hall from 4 April inside a special viewing room.</p> <p>It will be protected by the kind of security usually deployed around masterpieces such as Picasso's Guernica or a religious relic such as the Turin shroud, and uniformed guards will be stationed around the work.</p> <p>The skull has not been seen in this country since 2007, when it was sold to a consortium that included the artist, but it has recently drawn crowds in Florence and Amsterdam.</p> <p>The platinum cast of a human skull is encrusted with 8,601 pave-set diamonds weighing 1,106.18 carats, including a flawless, pink, pear-shaped diamond in the middle of the forehead. The cast's jaw is adorned with the skull's original teeth.</p> <p>\"I started thinking how, here in England, or the western world for that matter, we're obsessed with skulls and yet we avoid confronting death,\" the artist has explained.</p> <p>Although there have been Hirst retrospectives in Naples and Monaco, this will be the first solo show in a major British institution \u2013 one in which the artist swore he would never show his work. It will be, Hirst explained, \"a map of my life as an artist, not a greatest hits\".</p> <p>Nevertheless the show is to include the first \"spot\" painting, the first \"spin\" painting and the first medicine cabinet, along with the controversial shark in formaldehyde and <em>Mother and Child Divided</em> (1993), the installation featuring a bisected cow and calf suspended in four tanks.</p> <p>Outside the gallery, <em>Hymn</em>, the artist's huge statue based on a child's educational anatomical model, will expose its internal organs to the Thames.</p> <p>\u2022 The following correction was published on 18 March 2012:<br>\"Damien Hirst plans 'Saatchi moment' (News) described plans to display the artist's \u00a350m platinum and diamond skull at Tate Modern and said it was made for him by Bentley and Skinner of Bond Street, \"the jewellers who made the imperial state crown\". While they are by royal appointment, Bentley and Skinner did not make the crown. It was remade by Garrard in 1937, using 3,000 gems transferred from an earlier crown.</p>",

They could already claim to be the Super League's away-day specialists, as they have now won all three of their matches on the road this season while losing each of three at Odsal. But that is a pretty meaningless statistic, given the gulf in quality between the opposition they have faced at home and away. They probably did not play as well here as in gutsy defeat by Warrington last weekend, but it was still a notable victory after they had trailed 24-8 early in the second half, before the unheralded wing Jason Crookes led a fightback with a skilful and opportunist hat-trick. St Helens, whose early-season crisis deepened with a home defeat by Hull FC on Friday night, will not relish the prospect of a trip to Odsal next Saturday night. \"We could have gone two ways,\" said Mick Potter, the laconic Australian coach whose sympathy for Saints will be limited. \"It could have been 40 points, but I thought the guys stuck together and responded.\" Their efforts were all the more admirable given the loss of two senior forwards, Jamie Langley and Nick Scruton, to first-half injuries, adding to the lengthy casualty list the Bulls brought into the game. But the young substitute Jack Addy made a real impact, the teenage second-row John Bateman worked his socks off, and the former Newcastle Knights centre Keith Lulia had an eye-catching game inside Crookes. The Rovers coach, Craig Sandercock, was seething at his team's second-half capitulation, especially after such a bright start. They had been irresistible in shooting to a 12-0 lead inside seven minutes with tries from Mickey Paea and Kris Welham, the centre's skilful finish offering a hint of why he was one of the more surprising inclusions in the England training squad announced on Tuesday. Even after Bradford grafted back into the match with Crookes's first sharp finish followed by a walk-in for Karl Pryce, Rovers seemed to have stretched out of sight with further tries either side of half-time from Josh Hodgson and the classy Craig Hall. But the pattern of the first half was repeated as Bradford's more methodical approach gradually brought rewards. First Crookes caught Rovers napping from acting half for his second try, then he set one up for the veteran hooker Matt Diskin with a quick-thinking inside kick. Jarrod Sammut's second conversion reduced the arrears to 24-20, and within two minutes of that the Bulls were ahead for the first time, as the second-row Elliot Whitehead burst down the right and sent the full-back Brett Kearney dashing to the posts. Another terrific Crookes finish sealed it. Elsewhere, London Broncos finally claimed their first victory since reverting to their old name after six seasons as Harlequins, with the gifted Hemel Stags product Dan Sarginson marking his first appearance of the year with an important try in a 42-16 win against Castleford at the Stoop. The Super League's other non-northern team, Catalan Dragons, also recorded a comfortable home victory, beating Salford 40-18 in Perpignan to climb to fifth.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Hughes, the QPR manager, rounded on the Football Association on Saturday for what he claimed was an attempt to deflect attention from the match officials' \"poor\" performances in his struggling side's controversial 2-1 defeat at Bolton. Hughes was outraged that the referee's assistants did not spot that Clint Hill's 20th-minute effort had clearly crossed the line and claimed it was \"laughable\" that the FA's response to the latest 'ghost goal' controversy was to renew calls for goalline technology. Although he absolved the referee, Martin Atkinson, of any blame, Hughes was scathing in his criticism of Bob Pollock and Jake Collin. Pollock failed to spot that Hill's header was two yards over the line before being scooped out by the Bolton goalkeeper, Adam Bogdan, while Collin upheld an equaliser for Hughes's team two minutes after the break despite Djibril Ciss\u00e9 appearing to be offside. \"The laughable thing is that the FA have come out in support of goalline technology within an hour of the game finishing,\" said Hughes. \"It is absolutely ludicrous that they try to protect the poor performances of the officials that they supply. Until it comes in, actually do the job that the assistants are supposed to do: which is check whether or not the ball has gone over the line. \"You ask for the key moments and key decisions in games to be judged correctly. In fairness to Martin Atkinson, he is acknowledged as one of the better referees, and his performance was OK. I just felt he was let down by his assistants. They missed the key moments you have to get. \"They even got our goal wrong because that was offside, so they haven't covered themselves in glory at all. They missed a penalty, a hand ball in the area, and in the end the guy on my side [Collin] completely lost his nerve to make any decision.\" Contrary to Hughes's claims, it is the Professional Game Match Officials Board that designates who officiates at matches in consultation with the Premier League. The FA merely reacted to the controversy, as it was being analysed by Sky Sports' expert panel at half-time, by reiterating their desire to see goalline technology introduced at the earliest opportunity. \"The FA has been a leading proponent of Goal Line Technology for many years,\" read a statement. \"We will continue to press for its introduction once further independent testing is complete later this year, so that anyone wishing to introduce the technology is able to do so at the earliest possible opportunity.\" The International Football Association Board are to decide on whether to adopt goalline technology into the global game at a specially convened meeting in Kiev on 2 July, after last weekend giving two companies \u2013 Goalref and the British-based HawkEye \u2013 the green light to carry out further testing on their products. This latest episode contributed to QPR plunging into the bottom three with 10 matches remaining. The QPR captain, Joey Barton, tweeted: \"Seminal moment in the game. We have to be the unluckiest team ever this season. When ur down there, u rarely get rub of the green. Big decisions all wrong. Ref saying 'don't blame us blame, the FA for not having goal line technology!' Sort of sums it all up.\"",

      "body": "<p>Mark Hughes, the QPR manager, rounded on the Football Association on Saturday for what he claimed was an attempt to deflect attention from the match officials' \"poor\" performances in his struggling side's controversial 2-1 defeat at Bolton.</p> <p>Hughes was outraged that the referee's assistants did not spot that Clint Hill's 20th-minute effort had clearly crossed the line and claimed it was \"laughable\" that the FA's response to the latest 'ghost goal' controversy was to renew calls for goalline technology.</p> <p>Although he absolved the referee, Martin Atkinson, of any blame, Hughes was scathing in his criticism of Bob Pollock and Jake Collin. Pollock failed to spot that Hill's header was two yards over the line before being scooped out by the Bolton goalkeeper, Adam Bogdan, while Collin upheld an equaliser for Hughes's team two minutes after the break despite Djibril Ciss\u00e9 appearing to be offside.</p> <p>\"The laughable thing is that the FA have come out in support of goalline technology within an hour of the game finishing,\" said Hughes. \"It is absolutely ludicrous that they try to protect the poor performances of the officials that they supply. Until it comes in, actually do the job that the assistants are supposed to do: which is check whether or not the ball has gone over the line.</p> <p>\"You ask for the key moments and key decisions in games to be judged correctly. In fairness to Martin Atkinson, he is acknowledged as one of the better referees, and his performance was OK. I just felt he was let down by his assistants. They missed the key moments you have to get.</p> <p>\"They even got our goal wrong because that was offside, so they haven't covered themselves in glory at all. They missed a penalty, a hand ball in the area, and in the end the guy on my side [Collin] completely lost his nerve to make any decision.\"</p> <p>Contrary to Hughes's claims, it is the Professional Game Match Officials Board that designates who officiates at matches in consultation with the Premier League. The FA merely reacted to the controversy, as it was being analysed by Sky Sports' expert panel at half-time, by reiterating their desire to see goalline technology introduced at the earliest opportunity. \"The FA has been a leading proponent of Goal Line Technology for many years,\" read a statement. \"We will continue to press for its introduction once further independent testing is complete later this year, so that anyone wishing to introduce the technology is able to do so at the earliest possible opportunity.\"</p> <p>The International Football Association Board are to decide on whether to adopt goalline technology into the global game at a specially convened meeting in Kiev on 2 July, after last weekend giving two companies \u2013 Goalref and the British-based HawkEye \u2013 the green light to carry out further testing on their products.</p> <p>This latest episode contributed to QPR plunging into the bottom three with 10 matches remaining.</p> <p>The QPR captain, Joey Barton, tweeted: \"Seminal moment in the game. We have to be the unluckiest team ever this season. When ur down there, u rarely get rub of the green. Big decisions all wrong. Ref saying 'don't blame us blame, the FA for not having goal line technology!' Sort of sums it all up.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scotland's run of defeats goes on, six of the worst after another promising but fruitless performance against opponents who finished smartly but were often wasteful and careless and showed why they were not challenging for the title. Andy Robinson does not have much hair left to pull out, but the Scotland coach needs not so much to start over this week, with a wooden spoon decider against Italy being served up in Rome on Saturday, but restart over, given his players' dismal attempts to secure possession from kick-offs and self-destructive capacity to follow up a score by giving away tries. Little is going for Robinson and his team, starting during the warm-up when the centre Nick de Luca felt a hamstring go and Max Evans, a wing, was deployed out of position in midfield. Robinson was a study in dejection after the match, unable to explain some decision-making and Scotland's collapse after the break. \"We were the cause of a lot of our own problems,\" said a coach who is more likely to resign than be sacked. Scotland have improved under Robinson in terms of performances, but a reason they are closer to Italy in the Six Nations than the other four sides is the two countries have similar playing resources. There is only so much Robinson will ever achieve and his chagrin was all the deeper for losing heavily to a side who were merely competent thanks to some inept defending. Ireland were never more dangerous than when Jonathan Sexton was taking a kick-off. His first, after Greig Laidlaw's second penalty gave Scotland an early six-point lead, saw John Barclay collared by his opposite number, Stephen Ferris, who succeeded in keeping the ball off the floor. Ross Rennie was penalised at the next ruck, 30 metres from his own line, but Sexton kicked for touch rather than goal. Donnacha Ryan won the lineout, but Rory Best's throw appeared to be no more straight than earlier passes from Stuart Hogg and Laidlaw that had earlier been called forward. Sport is arbitrary: Ryan, at the top of his jump, found Peter O'Mahony who passed to Best on the left wing and the hooker had the strength to ride Mike Blair's challenge and give his side the lead. Scotland's second restart gift came after Laidlaw had replied to Sexton's penalty to make it 10-9, Ross Ford opting for the kick after running a previous penalty. Hogg dropped the ball and Graeme Morrison, standing in front of his full-back, tried to pick it up. Jamie Heaslip ran, and when Scotland defended a ruck five metres from their own line, there seemed no danger when the ball squirted out behind Eoin Reddan. The scrum-half was trying to get out of trouble when Sean Lamont and Blair made lunges rather than tackles and Reddan suddenly found himself with space to score an accidental try of a type that summed up Scotland's miserable fortune. So when, after a solo try from the second row Richie Gray, who walked through Reddan's challenge and side-stepped Rob Kearney, Scotland only had to secure the restart and keep the ball to go into the break 17-14 down. They were undone by Sexton's change of direction, kicking to the right rather than the left, where his forwards were lined up. Tommy Bowe caught the ball but the danger for Scotland looked over when Sexton's poor kick into the 22 was marked by Lee Jones. The wing opted to pass rather than kick to touch and Laidlaw was forced to hastily clear. Ireland used the attacking position to move the ball and even though Kearney wasted an opportunity by ignoring Bowe outside him and going for the line, Scotland were caught out from the ruck when Andrew Trimble emerged from his opposite wing and found room where none should have existed and gave his side a 22-14 interval lead. Ireland were missing Brian O'Driscoll and Paul O'Connell in a Six Nations match for the first time since 2001, but they have a broader playing depth than Scotland whose world-class performers, like Gray, mix with journeymen. Scotland did improve their error rate behind the scrum, not least because they started to get turned over at the breakdown and had less possession. The flow of the opening period turned into a trickle: Ireland should have extended their lead when Sexton fooled the Scots into thinking he was going to attempt to kick a penalty only to chip the ball to the corner for Bowe, who was looking for a record-equalling sixth try in a Six Nations campaign. Bowe caught the ball but Morrison had sensed the danger and tackled the wing just before the line. When Bowe eventually touched the ball down, he was penalised for a double movement. Scotland threatened less. Gray had a few charges and Ireland's speed in defence allowed them to get away with being outnumbered out wide, although Trimble's arms-free tackle on Jones, which led to a clash of heads and the Scotland wing being knocked out and taken to hospital after he had recovered consciousness, was a dangerous way for one move to end. Evans was sent to the sin-bin seven minutes from time for body-checking Keith Earls as the centre chased his chip to the line. Sexton had by then extended Ireland's lead to 11 points with his second penalty. Scotland may have been thinking about Rome when Fergus McFadden squirmed over.",

      "bodyText": "Typical, isn't it? Just when a prospective England manager emerges who enjoys the support of most of the country, his team go and lose three Premier League games on the trot. The curse of the England manager seems to have struck Harry Redknapp while still in waiting. If David Moyes in interested in taking over from him at White Hart Lane this was a pretty good job application \u2013 you would never have guessed Everton were the side with the shoestring budget \u2013 but much more of this from Spurs and Redknapp will start to look less of a shoo-in for the national side. Just as Spurs are no longer looking quite so certain to finish above Arsenal or even stay in the top four. The game was something of a slow burner, with neither goalkeeper being asked to do anything for the first quarter of an hour, although Spurs could have scored first when Jermain Defoe expertly found space and turned John Heitinga, only to shoot wide with just Tim Howard to beat. That seemed to wake Everton up a little, and for a time Brad Friedel was the busier of the two goalkeepers, saving a shot from Marouane Fellaini before being beaten midway through the first half when Nikica Jelavic scored a goal on his home debut. Quite a lot of the credit for that belonged to Leon Osman, who had earlier dispossessed Emmanuel Adebayor with one of the neatest pieces of skill of the afternoon, before he accepted Leighton Baines's pass with his back to goal and made light work of turning past Scott Parker and striding into the area. Spurs were hardly allowed any time to respond to the danger, Osman releasing a quick square ball that the former Rangers striker despatched first time past Friedel's outstretched hand. Royston Drenthe tested the American next with a low shot that Friedel stopped on the line, before Jelavic had him racing across goal to keep out a shot from a free-kick. All Spurs were able to manage by way of a reply before the interval were a couple of long-range Gareth Bale free kicks that went wide. Although Parker demonstrated from an early stage the ability to pick out the winger with inch- perfect crossfield passes, Bale produced little to surprise the home defence from open play even when he swapped wings with Luka Modric. Everton ended the half passing the ball around quite comfortably, not really going anywhere but keeping possession and keeping out of Spurs' reach. Neat passing triangles and assured ball retention have not exactly been staples of the Everton diet in recent seasons and the home crowd responded with warm applause, doubtless a pleasing sound to David Moyes in the week of his 10th anniversary at the club. Spurs began the second half as if they had been told in no uncertain terms that being outplayed by Everton was not good enough, and Defoe forced a sharp save from Howard within minutes of the restart. Seven minutes later, the Everton goalkeeper produced an even better stop from the same player, really coming to his side's rescue after Parker's pass to Defoe had exposed Sylvain Distin's slowness on the turn. Spurs cranked up the pressure further still just before the hour by sending on Louis Saha for the ineffective Adebayor. By the time Modric drove narrowly over Howard's bar on the hour it was beginning to look as though Spurs might be able to do that without Saha's assistance, although when Youn\u00e8s Kaboul persuaded Bale to let him have a go with a free-kick from the edge of the area his effort flew harmlessly high into the Park End. Howard had to make another save from Defoe even as Rafael van der Vaart was preparing to take the field for the last 20 minutes, though Everton do not lack heart and after Jack Rodwell had brusquely knocked Bale off the ball Osman raced into the area to bring a save from Friedel. When Defoe finally beat Howard from Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto's cross he was correctly adjudged to have been standing a yard offside, although as the game went into its last 10 minutes with a foul on Saha that brought a booking for Heitinga the home side were fighting such ba rearguard action that Moyes sent on Phil Jagielka as an extra defender to help them hold out. There was predictable fury when the fourth official signalled five extra minutes after a half that contained no goals or serious injuries, added time in which Saha managed to hit a post following a corner. Everton's luck must have been in. Redknapp's is out for the time being, yet in the end, after a truly frantic finale, this was anything but a poor Spurs performance. The bad luck was simply a run of games featuring Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton at their feistiest.",

      "bodyText": "Good evening everybody. So what's going wrong with Tottenham? Since the media began their courting of Harry Redknapp for the England job (a display of servile fawning that would put Daily Express report on Kate Middleton to shame) Spurs have fallen off the wagon somewhat. Sure, there was a 5-0 thrashing of Newcastle in there but defeats in their next two league matches, contributing to a run of only two wins in six, and suddenly Tottenham are looking anxiously over their shoulder at their north London rivals Arsenal who are coming up on the rails like a rabid zombie from 28 Days Later intent on feasting on the blood of third place. Glorious, glorious third place. Of course, there is also a chance that none of that is relevant and that Tottenham have merely lost their last two games because of a desperately poor 55 minutes against Arsenal and a mugging by Manchester United at White Hart Lane. But that doesn't suit the insatiable thirst for a narrative which goes world beaters-crisis-world beaters-crisis and what is certain is that a defeat today and people will be looking very hard at Spurs while tut-tutting and shaking their heads. And they certainly don't want that. And defeat is very much a possibility. Everton have beaten Manchester City and Chelsea at Goodison already this season and are currently in the midst of their best spell of the campaign, with no defeats in seven in the league. In fact they were last beaten in the league by Tottenham on 11 January in a fixture re-arranged from the opening day of the season after some yoofs around Tottenham decided they wanted some blu-ray players last August and wrecked the place. David Moyes celebrates 10 years in charge of Everton on Wednesday which begs the question: why would anyone want to spend 10 years at Everton? But in a climate where most manager's last about as long as it's taken you to read this sentence, a decade at a Premier League club which has largely been spent under a financial cloud that has been raining down gloom is quite some doing. Victory today would be an ideal way to celebrate the achievement and, slightly ironically, would lead to another wave of speculation that Moyes is the man to replace Redknapp if and when Harry does one for England. 5.09pm: David Moyes and Moe Syzlak. Have they ever been seen in the same room? Probably not. Anyway, back to the serious matters. Gravely serious matters. It is football, after all. Here are the teams ... Everton: Howard; Neville, Heitinga, Distin, Baines; Coleman, Osman, Fellaini, Drenthe; Cahill; Jelavic. Subs: Mucha, Hibbert, Jagielka, Stracqualursi, Gueye, Rodwell, Anichebe. Tottenham: Friedel; Walker, Kaboul, King, Assou-Ekotto; Bale, Sandro,Parker, Modric; Adebayor, Defoe. Subs: Cudicini, Van der Vaart, Saha, Kranjcar, Rose, Livermore, Nelson. Referee: Mark Halsey (Lancashire) 5.10pm: \"Re: Spurs' recent decline,\" writes Mark Cruise. \"I think there might be a few other factors at play - Since Saha arrived - he had a good game vs Newcastle, which has prompted 'Arry to play a 4-4-2. Most of Spurs success has come with a sort of 4-4-1-1, with Bale and Lennon wide, and Van Der Vaart sitting behind the striker. He seems to have abandoned that recently, and Bale seems to have abandoned playing wide altogether.\" No Saha today - he's on the bench - it's Jermain Defoe who is upsetting the balance with his low centre of gravity and his long-range shots. 5.24pm: And back to the real business. Regarding Moyes and Moe, Alex Hanton says: \"I always thought Moyes looked like what McNulty from the Wire would look like had he actually spent 20 years as a hardened Baltimore detective instead of hanging around RADA working out and exfoliating.\" Fair enough, but what Simpsons character is closest to 'Arry. Mayor Quimby? 5.26pm: Howard Kendall is in the \"posh seats\" according ESPN. I thought there was no push seats at Goodison. If Moyes was to move on maybe Everton could put Kendall back in charge. After all, if Dalglish can go back to Liverpool ... 5.28pm: \"I was going to object your reference to zombies in 28 Days Later,\" says Ian Copestake, \"but instead it made me think that, well, they are the dead come to life so they could technically be zombies. They just run about a lot more. Sort of like Charlie Adam.\" 5.32pm: \"I don't know about Harry, but I always thought Martin Jol was a dead ringer for Superintendent Chalmers,\" says Mark Cruise. Don't you mean SuperNintendo Chalmers? You're right though, you don't know about me. Peeep!!!!! Everton get us underway playing from right to left. Bale starts on the right for Spurs, Modric out left. 2 min: A loose pass from Heitinga leaves Osman floundering and Bale pounces, sprints down the right. Distin does well to shepherd Bale onto his right-foot where he doesn't look entirely comfortable and Distin manages to block his cross. 4 min: Moyes has switched Coleman to the left to counter-act the threat of Bale but the Irishman's first involvement is as an attacking threat as he cuts inside but drags his shot from the edge of the area wide of Friedel's post. \"Am I right to think that if Everton win tonight, Tuesday's derby is a battle for position?\" asks Gary Naylor, who is correct, obviously. \"What a present that would be for David Moyes.\" 7 min: It's a fairly flat opening to the game. Both sides seem slightly unbalanced by having wide players whose first instinct is to cut inside. If they would only swap ... but what do I know? Anyway, more Simpsons chatter from Steven Hughes: \"If 'Arry takes the England job he'll end up like The Simpsons' Gil soon enough.\" 10 min: AB, who is one letter away from being a very rich ex-Chelsea manager, writes: \"the posh seats at Goodison are the ones obstructed by the posts when Everton play everyone's favourite 4-6-0 formation. it's the reason they didn't play Jelavic for ages after buying him - forwards are too risky!\" 12 min: Bale's pass it cut out by Baines who finds the debutant Jelavic who shows the skills which made him such a hit in the SPL, in so far as he turns one way, then the other, then trips over the ball and gives it away. 14 min: Nothing much happening. This game is making me hungry. \"Arry as Frank Costanza?\" asks Ryang via the Twitter machine. \"Or George's boss Kruger?\" You mean this man? 18 min: Spurs have the first real chance of the game as the Everton defence opens up in front of the Defoe, who saunters into the area and is about to pull the trigger with his left foot but Heitinga gets back well to put him off and the shot ends up somewhere near the corner flag, which is probably where a Jermain Defoe left-footed shot would have ended up even without a challenge. 20 min: The best chance of the game and it comes to Fellaini who latches on the Jelavic's nod down and fires a left-footed half-volley from a tight angle which Friedel saves with his foot. Goal! EVERTON 1-0 Tottenham (Jelavic 22) Everton have the lead and it's Jelavic, on his full debut, who has the goal. Baines picked out Osman on the edge of the Spurs box with a drilled pass. Osman skipped by Kaboul, who needlessly threw himself into the challenge, and had the wherewithal to spot Jelavic and cut the ball back. The Croatian produced a fine side-footed finish, first time, low into the corner. Great strike. 27 min: There hasn't been a huge amount from Spurs in the way of a response. At least not from the players. The emails are little more animated. \"Is it possible we're back in a position where Redknapp doesn't actually know what his best formation or best line up is?\" asks Enna Cooper. \"He doesn't seem to like making those kind of decisions and tends to just preserve of the status quo any time there's a tough choice to be made. It took injuries to other players for him to work out that Modric was wasted out wide and that we were better playing 4-4-1-1. He was initially determined that Bale should be a fullback, possibly just so he had one less midfielder to accommodate in the formation. Signing Saha and (possibly temporary) resurgence in form from Defoe seems to have thrown him and it feels as if he's gone back to his default 4-4-2 simply to avoid having to decide which of our three strikers to play. Imagine how confused he'll be if the gets the England job.\" 28 min: Free kick to Spurs about 30 yards out and a significant proximity to the touchline. That doesn't bother Bale who fires goalwards and for a moment it looks like it might swerve just inside Tim Howard's post but in the end the Everton keeper watches it drift wide. \"I knew the second you mocked Jelavic he would score today,\" says Ryan Jones. \"Please direct further ire toward goal-shy Tim Cahill and Tony Hibbert, the latter of whom has never scored for Everton despite playing 14,823 games for the club.\" It sounds like you're mocking me, Ryan? Maybe I'll do something good in a minute. I doubt it. 33 min: Sandro gives away free kick and Jelavic nearly does something else quite spectacular. He curls the free kick over the wall and Friedel has to scamper across goal and claw it away. It was actually a fairly comfortable save for Friedel in the end. 40 min: Harry may have to break his gentleman's agreement with David Moyes over Louis Saha's involvement if he wants to get back in this game. Spurs are toothless going forward, which makes sense if you imagine scoring a goal as taking a bite out of a massive hamburger. Bale shoots from the edge of the box but it barely reaches Tim Howard in the Everton goal and Defoe was in the way and offside anyway. 41 min: A brief glimpse of a way back into the game for Spurs. Everton make a bit of a mess of dealing with a free kick and the ball reaches Sandro at the back stick but his cross-shot is blocked behind. 44 min: Emmanuel Adebayor crashes into the advertising hoardings and Arsenal fans everywhere break into a smile. Phil Sawyer has been hard at work \"So in decreasing order of animation we have 1. Charlie Adam, 2. (possible) zombies, 3. the game and 4. MBMers emails? I fear for your circulatory system, Evan. When Charlie Adam's the most exciting thing to think about that kind of low level of stimulation could be coma inducing.\" That hamburger mention will keep me going for a bit, I reckon. 45 min: One minute of added time. For those in the back that's one minute of added time. Half time: Everton 1-0 Tottenham. Jelavic's fine strike gives David Moyes's side a deserved lead at half time. Spurs have looked about as interested as a vegetarian in a steak house. I'm going to take a five minute break to contemplate all my important life choices up until this point. Half time emails. Gary Naylor brings some love for the man they call 'Moyesy': \"After ten years running Everton on a hand to mouth basis, can David Moyes be hailed as the best decision-maker in the Premier League? Every week he has to decide whether to emphasise attack or defence, every week he has to assess the benefit of fielding players carrying knocks in a wafer-thin squad and every transfer window calls for shrewd deals in and out. Over all that time, his errors are remarkably few.\" Meanwhile Pete Coles brings the pain for the man he calls 'The Hibster': \"I'm not actually watching this game, so maybe he's playing a blinder, but I've always wondered how Tony Hibbert has made it as a (regularly selected) premier league footballer. Is it just me? I've no wish to pick on the man for the sake of it, but seriously, isn't he just quite, well, rubbish?\" Half time enlightenment. I decided not to come to any conclusions about my own life choices but instead focused all my anger on the quirky-song advert. They really are the worst thing humanity has ever had to endure. That's not overstating it, is it? If they contain coloured bouncing balls they're even worse. More Spurs ire. Rob Sheppeck says: \"As a Spurs fan, I have to say that if this is the start of 'the wheels coming off phase' and we finish below arsenal again I'm going to have to stop watching football. I know we normally finish second best but to get my hopes this far up only to dash them is one disappointment too many.\" On David Moyes, Simon Glinn quips: \"I fail to see how anyone who accepts a job working for Everton can be nominated as a good decision maker, let alone \"the best in the Premier League\" Peeep!: We're underway in the second half. No changes, either tactically or in personnel, from Tottenham. Perhaps a change in approach, however, as they're straight onto the attack with Defoe testing Howard from them the edge of the area. 47 min: \"How's Mr Drenthe playing for Everton?\" asks Shaun Thompson in tepid Alicante. \"When he played here last year for H\u00e9rcules, he went from hero to zero quicker than he was once clocked by the Alicante Rozzers for speeding along the sea-front with a very-refreshed lady in the passenger seat. A good, jinksy player when he could be bothered, would be my verdict. Yours?\" We haven't seen an awful lot of jinksy from him tonight but saying that he's done more than Spurs' nominal wide men, Modric and Bale. 49 min: Spurs look a bit more of a threat this half as Parker robs Coleman and lobs the ball over the top to Defoe. he cuts inside, and tries an audacious left footed shot which ends, up, as earlier, somewhere near the corner flag. Still no tactical change from Redknapp. Sticking Modric out on the left has shades of Scholes being plonked there England. It smacks of having them in the team for the sake of it. 53 min: The best chance of the game for Spurs and again it's fallen to Defoe. He makes a diagonal run onto Parker's straight pass, takes a touch and settles himself before shooting with his left. Howard stays big and blocks the shot and gathers after the ball rebounds off Heitinga. 54 min: Louis Saha comes on for Emmanuel Adebayor. Harry breaks his non-legally binding gentleman's agreement. Do the FA want that kind of person in charge of England? \"Tony Hibbert is rubbish,\" confirms Gary Naylor, \"but he is disciplined, reads the game well and works hard for 90 minutes. That shouldn't be enough, but it is. Ask Phil Neville.\" 57 min: Spurs are really coming into this now. Bale hammers a perfect cross-field pass to Assou-Ekotto, whose drilled cross should be cut out by Fellaini but he mis-controls, Modric gathers, and hits a half-volley just over the top. \"I don't know why, but whenever I hear Drenthe, I can't help but think of Creme de Menthe,\" says Chris Dunn. Thanks for that, Chris. It's probably because they rhyme. 59 min: Tottenham win a fortuitous corner after Defoe handled, but Bale's delivery is terrible and the ball sails over everyone and out of play on the far side. Which leads nicely to Sasu Laaksonen's email: \"Bale, The most (press) overrated player in the league at the moment? A bit like 'Arry Redknapp in the managerial front.\" 61 min: A yellow card for Assou-Ekotto and Everton have a free kick in a dangerous area. It's swung in by Baines towards Fellaini but Spurs scramble the threat away. On Twitter, @kawatabake writes: \"Re: Pete Coles ant-Hibbertism, Hibbert is a good defender and if he scores there will be amazing scenes. So he should play.\" 62 min: Yellow card for Defoe for knocking Heitinga over off the ball. I'm not sure how Jermain Defoe knocks over Heitinga but there you go. Coleman catches Sandro right on the edge of the area and this is a really good shooting position for Spurs. It's maybe a little too close so they'll have to go for power ... 63 min: ... yep it's power alright, as Kaboul hoof it with great power high into the stand. \"Gary makes an interesting point about Moyes' lack of errors in decision making,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Merseyside seems to have a bit of a yin/yang thing going on at the moment, given that Dalglish's errors of judgement since returning have, what with one thing and another, been worryingly high (I say this a Liverpool supporter).\" 64 min: Royston Drenthe comes off and Jack Rodwell is on. Re: Drenthe rhyming with Menthe, Matthew Walker says: \"As a speaker of Dutch, I can assure you they don't rhyme.\" You're not saying it right, Matthew. 66 min: \"Half hour to save our season, really Evan,\" says Steve Waterhouse. I'm not sure if that's a question laced with sarcasm or a statement. If I had to put money on it I'd go with the latter. I'll stick \u00a350 on it. Boy, this is exciting. 67 min: Parker tries to slide in Saha but Distin sticks out a foot and deflects the ball into Defoe's path. His shot from the edge of the area takes a deflection which takes the pace off the shot (which was probably going wide anyway) and Howard saves. \"If Harry needs to pick a new formation every match, does that mean his players' skill sets (ignoring injuries) are so narrow they're only good for one thing?\" asks Paul Taylor. \" I could imagine Pep G. moving his X all over the field to no discernible detriment.\" 70 min: Van der Vaart is on for Sandro as Redknapp again ignores how lopsided his side are. Saha bundles his way into the box but his stabbed shot catches Distin right in the kisser. 71 min: Everton counter-attack and the ball is squeezed out to Osman on the right. He's in acres of space, takes his time, but fires at the near post rather than across goal and Friedel beats the ball away. 73 min: The Spurs fans are apparently singing \"Gareth Bale, he plays on the left.\" Their next song can be, \"Luka Modric, he's best in the hole.\" Rick Buur emails about Royston Drenthe: \"For Shaun Thompson in Alicante: I seem to remember that Drenthe fell out of favour because he was the only of the Hercules players who had the guts to speak up against the crooked owners who didn't pay the wages. While the other weasels chose to stay silent, the fans turned against the wrong party. Also he is as mad as a box of frogs.\" 77 min: Tottenham have the ball in the net but the flag is up for offside! It's the right decision. It was horrible defending from Rodwell, who sliced his clearance. The ball came off Bale's chest into the path of Defoe, who was two yards offside. He put it in the net but it won't count. 78 min: Everton make another change as the goalscorer Jelavic departs - he's faded as the game has gone on, understandably - and Stracqualursi is on. 79 min: Yellow card for Heitinga for a poor challenge on Bale. It's another decent position for Spurs ... Bale floats a cross to the back stick where King rises but nods wide. \"In response to Mr. Sheppeck,\" says Ben Ricerson. \"To the contrary, this will be the most edifying of seasons for all Spurs fans. Like England, it is typical of Tottenham to build up expectation before crushing it mercilessly; on the evidence of the past few weeks, it would appear that it is finally time for, as you say, \"the wheels to fall off.\" The bittersweet taste of humiliation and failure will never be so vivid as long as we continue to disappoint!\" 82 min: Moe Syzlak makes his final change as Phil Jagielka comes on for Seamus Coleman. \"It's all very well to criticise HR's tactics,\" says Alistair Hann. \"It's a popular pastime for fans who think themselves able to deliver damning judgement on the tactical aptitude of a man who has spent nearly 50 years in the game - but who one earth would they play on the left instead of Modric? Kranjcar is the only player in the squad capable of filling in and he simply doesn't bring the required workrate. Fact is, we don't have huge strength-in-depth out wide. And we don't have the money to sign top players as cover in those positions.\" 86 min: Stracqualursi slides on late on Walker which probably should have been a yellow but he gets away with it. On that note, Phil Sawyer writes: \"Did Moyes send Stracqualursi on just to test your spelling at the end of a long working day?\" Three words Phil: Copy-And-Paste. 7.18pm: Redknapp makes his final change as Jake Livermore is on for Captain Scotty Parker or, if you prefer, Smithers to Harry's Mr Burns. 89 min: King is judged to have fouled Stracqualursi in the centre circle which gives Everton a moment's respite. \"Incidentally, it was probably a mistake to loan out Pienaar,\" says Alistair Hann. \"He was the one player we did have who could provide good cover for the left.\" 89 min: Osman hangs out a leg and Bale goes over it. Osman thinks he's dived and has a few words with Bale but there probably was contact (just). And anyway, hanging out a leg in front of Bale is like dangling a piece of meat in front of a dog. What do you expect to happen? 90 min: Fives minutes of added time. I don't know where that came from. 90 + 1 min: Assou-Ekotto hangs in a cross from the left which King meets but he gets under it and Howard can gather. 90+2 min: Van der Vaart shoots from the edge of the area - it takes a massive deflection and loops onto the roof of the net with Howard helpless. Everton are hanging on. 90+3 min: Louis Saha hits the post! It was Assou-Ekotto's shot from the edge of the area. It deflected into Saha's path inside the six-yard box. He spun on his left-foot and fired off the post. It rebounded off Howard's knee and away to safety. Full time: Everton 1-0 Tottenham. The ball is launched into the area one last time but Howard gathers and hoofs clear and that is that. A huge win for Everton and (arguably) an even bigger defeat for Spurs. 7.27pm: That's three defeats in a row for Tottenham and they are in a real battle not only for third but possibly even for a top four finish. Expect the calls for Redknapp to decide on his future one way or another to get louder and louder this week. Not that that is necessarily the problem, but hey ho, that's how it goes. What a win for Everton who are flying going into a week where they can leapfrog Liverpool with victory at Anfield on Tuesday and have an FA Cup quarter final against Sunderland next Saturday. That's it from me. Thanks for all your emails. Apologies, but there was far too many to publish them all. Click here for the latest Premier League table. Bye!",

Since the media began their courting of Harry Redknapp for the England job (a display of servile fawning that would put Daily Express report on Kate Middleton to shame) Spurs have fallen off the wagon somewhat. Sure, there was a 5-0 thrashing of Newcastle in there but defeats in their next two league matches, contributing to a run of only two wins in six, and suddenly Tottenham are looking anxiously over their shoulder at their north London rivals Arsenal who are coming up on the rails like a rabid zombie from 28 Days Later intent on feasting on the blood of third place. Glorious, glorious third place.</p> <p><strong>Of course, there is also a chance that none of that is relevant</strong> and that Tottenham have merely lost their last two games because of a desperately poor 55 minutes against Arsenal and a mugging by Manchester United at White Hart Lane. But that doesn't suit the insatiable thirst for a narrative which goes world beaters-crisis-world beaters-crisis and what is certain is that a defeat today and people will be looking very hard at Spurs while tut-tutting and shaking their heads. And they certainly don't want that. </p> <p><strong>And defeat is very much a possibility.</strong> Everton have beaten Manchester City and Chelsea at Goodison already this season and are currently in the midst of their best spell of the campaign, with no defeats in seven in the league.

Spurs are toothless going forward, which makes sense if you imagine scoring a goal as taking a bite out of a massive hamburger. Bale shoots from the edge of the box but it barely reaches Tim Howard in the Everton goal and Defoe was in the way and offside anyway.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>41 min: A brief glimpse of a way back into the game for Spurs. Everton make a bit of a mess of dealing with a free kick and the ball reaches Sandro at the back stick but his cross-shot is blocked behind.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>44 min: Emmanuel Adebayor crashes into the advertising hoardings and Arsenal fans everywhere break into a smile. Phil Sawyer has been hard at work \"So in decreasing order of animation we have 1. Charlie Adam, 2. (possible) zombies, 3. the game and 4. MBMers emails? I fear for your circulatory system, Evan. When Charlie Adam's the most exciting thing to think about that kind of low level of stimulation could be coma inducing.\" That hamburger mention will keep me going for a bit, I reckon.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>45 min: One minute of added time. For those in the back that's one minute of added time.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Half time: Everton 1-0 Tottenham.</strong> Jelavic's fine strike gives David Moyes's side a deserved lead at half time. Spurs have looked about as interested as a vegetarian in a steak house. I'm going to take a five minute break to contemplate all my important life choices up until this point.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half time emails.</strong> Gary Naylor brings some love for the man they call 'Moyesy': \"After ten years running Everton on a hand to mouth basis, can David Moyes be hailed as the best decision-maker in the Premier League? Every week he has to decide whether to emphasise attack or defence, every week he has to assess the benefit of fielding players carrying knocks in a wafer-thin squad and every transfer window calls for shrewd deals in and out. Over all that time, his errors are remarkably few.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Pete Coles brings the pain for the man he calls 'The Hibster': \"I'm not actually watching this game, so maybe he's playing a blinder, but I've always wondered how Tony Hibbert has made it as a (regularly selected) premier league footballer. Is it just me? I've no wish to pick on the man for the sake of it, but seriously, isn't he just quite, well, rubbish?\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half time enlightenment.</strong> I decided not to come to any conclusions about my own life choices but instead focused all my anger on the quirky-song advert. They really are the worst thing humanity has ever had to endure. That's not overstating it, is it? If they contain coloured bouncing balls they're even worse.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>More Spurs ire.</strong> Rob Sheppeck says: \"As a Spurs fan, I have to say that if this is the start of 'the wheels coming off phase' and we finish below arsenal again I'm going to have to stop watching football. I know we normally finish second best but to get my hopes this far up only to dash them is one disappointment too many.\"</p> <p><strong>On David Moyes</strong>, Simon Glinn quips: \"I fail to see how anyone who accepts a job working for Everton can be nominated as a good decision maker, let alone \"the best in the Premier League\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>Peeep!: We're underway in the second half. No changes, either tactically or in personnel, from Tottenham. Perhaps a change in approach, however, as they're straight onto the attack with Defoe testing Howard from them the edge of the area.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>47 min: \"How's Mr Drenthe playing for Everton?\" asks Shaun Thompson in tepid Alicante. \"When he played here last year for H\u00e9rcules, he went from hero to zero quicker than he was once clocked by the Alicante Rozzers for speeding along the sea-front with a very-refreshed lady in the passenger seat. A good, jinksy player when he could be bothered, would be my verdict. Yours?\" We haven't seen an awful lot of jinksy from him tonight but saying that he's done more than Spurs' nominal wide men, Modric and Bale.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>49 min: Spurs look a bit more of a threat this half as Parker robs Coleman and lobs the ball over the top to Defoe. he cuts inside, and tries an audacious left footed shot which ends, up, as earlier, somewhere near the corner flag. Still no tactical change from Redknapp. Sticking Modric out on the left has shades of Scholes being plonked there England. It smacks of having them in the team for the sake of it.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>53 min: The best chance of the game for Spurs and again it's fallen to Defoe. He makes a diagonal run onto Parker's straight pass, takes a touch and settles himself before shooting with his left. Howard stays big and blocks the shot and gathers after the ball rebounds off Heitinga.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>54 min: Louis Saha comes on for Emmanuel Adebayor. Harry breaks his non-legally binding gentleman's agreement. Do the FA want that kind of person in charge of England? \"Tony Hibbert is rubbish,\" confirms Gary Naylor, \"but he is disciplined, reads the game well and works hard for 90 minutes. That shouldn't be enough, but it is. Ask Phil Neville.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>57 min: Spurs are really coming into this now. Bale hammers a perfect cross-field pass to Assou-Ekotto, whose drilled cross should be cut out by Fellaini but he mis-controls, Modric gathers, and hits a half-volley just over the top. \"I don't know why, but whenever I hear Drenthe, I can't help but think of Creme de Menthe,\" says Chris Dunn. Thanks for that, Chris. It's probably because they rhyme.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>59 min: Tottenham win a fortuitous corner after Defoe handled, but Bale's delivery is terrible and the ball sails over everyone and out of play on the far side. Which leads nicely to Sasu Laaksonen's email: \"Bale, The most (press) overrated player in the league at the moment? A bit like 'Arry Redknapp in the managerial front.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>61 min: A yellow card for Assou-Ekotto and Everton have a free kick in a dangerous area. It's swung in by Baines towards Fellaini but Spurs scramble the threat away. On Twitter, @kawatabake writes: \"Re: Pete Coles ant-Hibbertism, Hibbert is a good defender and if he scores there will be amazing scenes. So he should play.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>62 min: Yellow card for Defoe for knocking Heitinga over off the ball. I'm not sure how Jermain Defoe knocks over Heitinga but there you go. Coleman catches Sandro right on the edge of the area and this is a really good shooting position for Spurs. It's maybe a little too close so they'll have to go for power ...</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>63 min: ... yep it's power alright, as Kaboul hoof it with great power high into the stand. \"Gary makes an interesting point about Moyes' lack of errors in decision making,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Merseyside seems to have a bit of a yin/yang thing going on at the moment, given that Dalglish's errors of judgement since returning have, what with one thing and another, been worryingly high (I say this a Liverpool supporter).\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p>64 min: Royston Drenthe comes off and Jack Rodwell is on. Re: Drenthe rhyming with Menthe, Matthew Walker says: \"As a speaker of Dutch, I can assure you they don't rhyme.\" You're not saying it right, Matthew.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>66 min: \"Half hour to save our season, really Evan,\" says Steve Waterhouse. I'm not sure if that's a question laced with sarcasm or a statement. If I had to put money on it I'd go with the latter. I'll stick \u00a350 on it. Boy, this is exciting.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>67 min: Parker tries to slide in Saha but Distin sticks out a foot and deflects the ball into Defoe's path. His shot from the edge of the area takes a deflection which takes the pace off the shot (which was probably going wide anyway) and Howard saves. \"If Harry needs to pick a new formation every match, does that mean his players' skill sets (ignoring injuries) are so narrow they're only good for one thing?\" asks Paul Taylor. \" I could imagine Pep G. moving his X all over the field to no discernible detriment.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>70 min: Van der Vaart is on for Sandro as Redknapp again ignores how lopsided his side are. Saha bundles his way into the box but his stabbed shot catches Distin right in the kisser.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p>71 min: Everton counter-attack and the ball is squeezed out to Osman on the right. He's in acres of space, takes his time, but fires at the near post rather than across goal and Friedel beats the ball away.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>73 min: The Spurs fans are apparently singing \"Gareth Bale, he plays on the left.\" Their next song can be, \"Luka Modric, he's best in the hole.\" Rick Buur emails about Royston Drenthe: \"For Shaun Thompson in Alicante: I seem to remember that Drenthe fell out of favour because he was the only of the Hercules players who had the guts to speak up against the crooked owners who didn't pay the wages. While the other weasels chose to stay silent, the fans turned against the wrong party. Also he is as mad as a box of frogs.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p>77 min: <strong>Tottenham have the ball in the net but the flag is up for offside!</strong> It's the right decision. It was horrible defending from Rodwell, who sliced his clearance. The ball came off Bale's chest into the path of Defoe, who was two yards offside. He put it in the net but it won't count.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p>78 min: Everton make another change as the goalscorer Jelavic departs - he's faded as the game has gone on, understandably - and Stracqualursi is on.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p>79 min: Yellow card for Heitinga for a poor challenge on Bale. It's another decent position for Spurs ... Bale floats a cross to the back stick where King rises but nods wide. \"In response to Mr. Sheppeck,\" says Ben Ricerson. \"To the contrary, this will be the most edifying of seasons for all Spurs fans. Like England, it is typical of Tottenham to build up expectation before crushing it mercilessly; on the evidence of the past few weeks, it would appear that it is finally time for, as you say, \"the wheels to fall off.\" The bittersweet taste of humiliation and failure will never be so vivid as long as we continue to disappoint!\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p>82 min: Moe Syzlak makes his final change as Phil Jagielka comes on for Seamus Coleman. \"It's all very well to criticise HR's tactics,\" says Alistair Hann. \"It's a popular pastime for fans who think themselves able to deliver damning judgement on the tactical aptitude of a man who has spent nearly 50 years in the game - but who one earth would they play on the left instead of Modric? Kranjcar is the only player in the squad capable of filling in and he simply doesn't bring the required workrate. Fact is, we don't have huge strength-in-depth out wide. And we don't have the money to sign top players as cover in those positions.\"</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p>86 min: Stracqualursi slides on late on Walker which probably should have been a yellow but he gets away with it. On that note, Phil Sawyer writes: \"Did Moyes send Stracqualursi on just to test your spelling at the end of a long working day?\" Three words Phil: Copy-And-Paste.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p>7.18pm: Redknapp makes his final change as Jake Livermore is on for Captain Scotty Parker or, if you prefer, Smithers to Harry's Mr Burns. </p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p>89 min: King is judged to have fouled Stracqualursi in the centre circle which gives Everton a moment's respite. \"Incidentally, it was probably a mistake to loan out Pienaar,\" says Alistair Hann. \"He was the one player we did have who could provide good cover for the left.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p>89 min: Osman hangs out a leg and Bale goes over it. Osman thinks he's dived and has a few words with Bale but there probably was contact (just). And anyway, hanging out a leg in front of Bale is like dangling a piece of meat in front of a dog. What do you expect to happen?</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p>90 min: Fives minutes of added time. I don't know where that came from.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p>90 + 1 min: Assou-Ekotto hangs in a cross from the left which King meets but he gets under it and Howard can gather.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p>90+2 min: Van der Vaart shoots from the edge of the area - it takes a massive deflection and loops onto the roof of the net with Howard helpless. Everton are hanging on.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p>90+3 min: <strong>Louis Saha hits the post! </strong> It was Assou-Ekotto's shot from the edge of the area. It deflected into Saha's path inside the six-yard box. He spun on his left-foot and fired off the post. It rebounded off Howard's knee and away to safety.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>Full time: Everton 1-0 Tottenham. </strong> The ball is launched into the area one last time but Howard gathers and hoofs clear and that is that. A huge win for Everton and (arguably) an even bigger defeat for Spurs.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p>7.27pm: That's three defeats in a row for Tottenham and they are in a real battle not only for third but possibly even for a top four finish. Expect the calls for Redknapp to decide on his future one way or another to get louder and louder this week. Not that that is necessarily the problem, but hey ho, that's how it goes. What a win for Everton who are flying going into a week where they can leapfrog Liverpool with victory at Anfield on Tuesday and have an FA Cup quarter final against Sunderland next Saturday. That's it from me. Thanks for all your emails. Apologies, but there was far too many to publish them all.

      "bodyText": "Goals in the first half by Roy O'Donovan and Leigh Griffiths were enough to beat First Division side Ayr United and put Hibernian into the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup. O'Donovan, on loan from Coventry, had the ball in the Ayr net in the fourth minute at Somerset Park after Ivan Sproule's drive from 16 yards was spilled by Kevin Cuthbert, but the flag was up for offside. The travelling fans only had to wait two more minutes for the opening goal, though, when O'Donovan headed in a George Francomb free-kick. When the loanee from Norwich City whipped his delivery in from wide on the left it found O'Donovan unmarked drifting into the box and his header beat Cuthbert and went in off a post. In the 16th minute, after the Hibs defender Paul Hanlon fouled Keigan Parker wide on the right, the home side missed a great chance to draw level. Michael McGowan's free-kick was met by the Ayr defender Chris Smith only six yards out but he failed to make proper contact, allowing the goalkeeper Graham Stack to smother. Three minutes later Griffiths made it 2-0 from the penalty spot after the Ayr defender Andrew Geggan had fouled the Hibs midfielder Isaiah Osbourne at a corner. Such was the force of the penalty that it took the netting away from its support. ' Griffiths then missed a great chance to finish Ayr off when he raced clear on goal, only to slash his shot wide. The home side persevered, throwing bodies forward, but in the 76th minute Hanlon's header from a Francomb corner was cleared off the line by Jonathon Tiffoney, before Osbourne miscued in front of goal when he looked poised to score. There was a vociferous appeal for an Ayr penalty in the 82nd minute when the Hibs substitute Matt Doherty appeared to handle the ball as he fell in the area but the referee ignored the penalty claims. Ayr battled hard to get back into the game but, having given themselves too much to do after going behind so early in the game, ran out of steam. Hibs will look forward to Sunday's draw and also a semi\u2011final at Hampden Park. In the only Scottish Premier League fixture this weekend, Roman Golobart made amends for a spectacular own goal by scoring the equaliser in a 1-1 draw between Inverness and Kilmarnock. It was just reward for Inverness, who dominated at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium. Inverness were better in the opening stages until the defender Golobart scored his second own goal of the season after 31 minutes. Danny Buijs struck an angled attempt from outside the penalty area high and wide as the visitors looked to add to their lead early in the second half. Shane Sutherland's rising shot from the edge of the penalty area was just over the crossbar for Terry Butcher's side. The Caley Thistle captain Richie Foran missed a gilt\u2011edged chance in the closing stages when his side\u2011footed effort from 10 yards was blocked by Cammy Bell. The keeper then tipped over Billy McKay's shot. But moments later after he denied Richie Foran's header, McKay found Golobart who scored from close range to level the scores with seven minutes remaining. Michael Nelson was picked out by Lee Johnson's free-kick but headed the ball straight at Esson as the two teams settled for a share of the points.",

      "bodyText": "A cursory glance at the form book, and this should be a shoo-in for the home side. Ireland may not be what they were a couple of years ago, yet in this Six Nations have been a poor refereeing decision from beating all-conquering Wales, and should really have put France away in Paris last weekend. Scotland, on the other hand, are joint bottom of the table, after three defeats from three. Yet you never know. Scotland have had an extra week to rest since their last game, have some fine fresh talent coming through in Stuart Hogg and David Denton, and are steadily (if slowly) improving, to the point that they've managed to cross the try line in their last two matches. Well done, everyone! Also, the last time these two teams met in Dublin, the Scots clocked up a rare away victory. Dan Parks put in a man-of-the-match performance, and if that can happen, etc., and so on... Karma dept. Scotland are due a bit of good fortune, having played better than their results suggest. But then Ireland are in credit with Lady Luck too after the Wales debacle. Ireland are favourites, so shouldn't need it, but we'll see. These two sides often serve up better-than-decent entertainment, so: better-than-decent entertainment, please! Ireland: R Kearney (Leinster); T Bowe (Ospreys), K Earls (Munster), G D'Arcy (Leinster), A Trimble (Ulster); J Sexton (Leinster), E Reddan (Leinster); C Healy (Leinster), R Best (Ulster, capt), M Ross (Leinster), D O'Callaghan (Munster), D Ryan (Munster), S Ferris (Ulster), P O'Mahony (Munster), J Heaslip (Leinster). Replacements: S Cronin (Leinster), T Court (Ulster), M McCarthy (Connacht), S Jennings (Leinster), T O'Leary (Munster), R O'Gara (Munster), F McFadden (Leinster). Scotland: S Hogg (Glasgow Warriors); L Jones (Edinburgh), N De Luca (Edinburgh), G Morrison (Glasgow Warriors), S Lamont (Scarlets); G Laidlaw (Edinburgh), M Blair (Edinburgh); A Jacobsen (Edinburgh), R Ford (capt, Edinburgh), G Cross (Edinburgh), R Gray (Glasgow Warriors), J Hamilton (Gloucester), J Barclay (Glasgow Warriors), R Rennie (Edinburgh), D Denton (Edinburgh). Replacements: S Lawson (Gloucester), E Murray (Newcastle), A Kellock (Glasgow Warriors), R Vernon (Sale Sharks), C Cusiter (Glasgow Warriors), R Jackson (Glasgow Warriors), M Evans (Castres). Referee: C Pollock (New Zealand) Kick off: 5pm. The teams are out! Ireland are in green, Scotland in blue. That's how they roll. Incidentally, the Irish have been taking advice from Michael O'Leary, the grasping Ryanair footpad, who gave the team a motivational chat during the week. It's a wonder they're not stranded about 60 miles from the Aviva Stadium. Perhaps they'll charge Scotland \u00a310 for every tooth they manage to knock out, \u00a350+VAT per cauliflower ear. The anthems. They're singing them. And we're off! Greig Laidlaw gets the ball spinning - the thing won't roll - and Heaslip gathers. Scotland soon get the ball back, though, and will get the put-in at a scrum just inside the Irish half. A good minute or so is wasted with some tedious fannying around at the engagement. There goes that atmosphere! Lansdowne Road is as good as silent already. 3 min: After two minutes of faffing around, Scotland are awarded a free kick. They move the ball out wide left towards Hogg, and nearly set the youngster off down the wing, but there's a forward pass. However, Bowe has drifted offside looking for an intercept, and that's a penalty to Scotland. 4 min: PENALTY. Ireland 0-3 SCOTLAND. Laidlaw hauds his baws for a few seconds, like a smutty Jonny Wilkinson, then strokes a kick between the posts. Scotland have the early lead. 7 min: Earls responds with a chip and chase down the left. Laidlaw is under it, and although clattered by Earls, keeps possession, allowing Scotland to move upfield. They're seeing most of the ball, and throwing it around quite nicely at the moment. 9 min: They've made 38 passes compared to Ireland's four. The final one of those flies behind Hogg as they look to release Scotland's youngest starter for 40 years down the right. 10 min: PENALTY. Ireland 0-6 SCOTLAND. D'Arcy joins a ruck from the side. Nope. Penalty to Scotland, 30 yards from the posts, just to the left of the sticks. Laidlaw makes no mistake. The Scottish passing game isn't quite clicking, but it's been good enough; they've had all the possession, and this is a fair enough scoreline. Ireland are yet to turn up. I blame Michael O'Leary. 12 min: Turnover ball for Ireland just outside the Scottish 22, down the right. Ireland shuttle it out to the left, where a penalty's awarded, Rennie joining the ruck from the side. Will they kick? Nope. Sexton clips the ball into touch right by the left-hand corner. They've got a five-metre lineout, and really need points from this. 14 min: TRY. IRELAND 5-6 Scotland. And they get them! The lineout's won, O'Callaghan moves the ball to the left touchline, and captain Best powers through Blair and over into the corner. 15 min: CONVERSION. IRELAND 7-6 Scotland. Sexton steps up to take the conversion. He checks, turns, and begins again. Meanwhile Sean Lamont assumes Sexton's started his run, races out, in the style of that Zaire player at the 1974 Fifa World Cup, and hoofs the static ball upfield! Some light comedy. Sexton isn't fussed: he resets, and sends a left-to-right slider between the posts. Ireland have the lead, their brave decision to turn down the penalty kick for goal paying dividends. 18 min: Scotland put a few phases together as they move upfield from the restart. Eventually Blair is tackled by the 22, and refuses to release. The pressure's off the home side, Reddan hoicking the penalty back up to the halfway line. After a shaky start, Ireland are slowly gaining the upper hand. 20 min: The latest pass completion stat: Scotland 60, Ireland 15. But take a look at the scoreline. 23 min: Scotland concede a penalty on halfway, allowing Ireland to find touch by their 22. Ireland win the lineout, and go through a few phases, making their way deeper into the Scottish 22. The Scots are looking shaky, Ireland getting closer and closer, but Healy refuses to release, and concedes a pressure-releasing penalty. Scotland clear their lines to touch - but then lose their first lineout of the tournament, Ford throwing in a cack-handed ball. Their stats were 33 from 33 up until that point. 25 min: A couple of scrums, and it's a penalty to Ireland, the Scots penalised for collapsing the thing. Jacobsen the guilty man, although he's not happy about it. Ireland will kick this one. 26 min: PENALTY. IRELAND 10-6 Scotland. Sexton, 35 yards out, to the left of goal, sends another kick to the left of the sticks, before curving back inside and whistling between them. 27 min: A lone piper plays a sad lament. Has he given up the ghost already? 30 min: The first real expansive move of the game, Ireland on halfway flinging a few quick long passes right to left, Kearney so nearly breaking through down the wing. But then Ryan spills the ball in the tackle, allowing Scotland to kick long down their left, and eventually winning some good field position. And after some shenanigans, it's a penalty to Scotland, O'Callaghan refusing to roll away. Laidlaw kicks for touch, and a five-metre lineout. A case of anything you can do...? 31 min: Not quite. Scotland attempt to send a rolling maul over the line, but it's collapsed. Another penalty. Kicked to touch again. Then Gray is hit in the air in the lineout. Another penalty. The Scots will kick this one for goal. It's tight on the left, though. 32 min: PENALTY. Ireland 10-9 SCOTLAND. But Laidlaw's kick is true. Scotland move to within a point of their hosts. They deserved a score from those phases of play. 33 min: TRY! IRELAND 15-9 Scotland. Ireland are right back up in Scotland's grille. They set themselves up in the Scottish 22, near the left-hand corner. Then some haplessness, followed microseconds later by brilliance, from Reddan, who slips as he looks to start a phase. It wrongfoots the Scottish defence, so he spins through 180 degrees, and scampers through a gap and over the line, tight in the left-hand corner. 35 min: CONVERSION. IRELAND 17-9 Scotland. A brilliant kick from Sexton, tight on the paint running down the left of the pitch. 36 min: To the piper's credit, he's gone jaunty with an upbeat skirl. A brave effort, all things considered. 37 min: TRY! Ireland 17-14 SCOTLAND. This is out of nothing. Gray bombs through a couple of tackles down the left. Bowe's in front of him, but Gray sells him a dummy to the left, drops a shoulder to slip to Bowe's right, and tears across the tryline. Wonderful solo play. 38 min: Laidlaw's kick, far out on the left, hits the left-hand post. No conversion. That always looked like just missing, though. Not a terrible kick, not a great one either. Scotland will be happy to be right back in this game. 40 min +1: TRY! IRELAND 22-14 Scotland. A lineout for Ireland down the right, just by the Scotland 22. One last score before the half is out? Earls nearly breaks through the Scottish defence, but the blue line holds firm. The ball's shuttled out wide right, and Kearney nearly breaks through. He's just short. The ball's recycled, and fed to Trimble, tight on the right touchline. And he powers over! That's brilliant from Ireland, and a real sickener for the Scots, who had just got back into the game. HALF TIME: Ireland 22-14 Scotland. Sexton misses a difficult kick. And that's that for a very entertaining half. Has Trimble's try jiggered Scotland's spirit? You'd think so, but this has been a far from predictable game so far. More, please! HALF-TIME ENTERTAINMENT: As a counterbalance to the lone piper, who has been dominating proceedings so far. The teams are out again! Sexton gets things moving. Scotland nearly repeat their restart farce against England, but Lamont is no Dan Parks, and eventually gathers. Ireland soon have the ball back, mind you. Should Ireland score first, you would imagine this game is over. 43 min: Scotland do pass it around nicely sometimes. Just no end product. A nice sweeping move, right to left, but Jones hasn't got enough space to work with down the wing, and eventually he's stopped in his tracks. Eventually the ball's turned over, and Ireland are eventually gifted a penalty by a frustrated Scotland, their saucy hands in the ruck. 45 min: Kearney creams a wonderful penalty into touch by the Scottish 22. This is brilliant field position for Ireland, but the ball's thrown into the lineout half-cocked, Best at his worst, and the pressure's off the visitors. 47 min: Staunch work by Denton, who has been quiet so far, but powers Scotland out of their own 22 and away from bother. A change for Scotland: Murray comes on for Cross. 48 min: Earls bombs down the middle of the pitch, sashaying as much as a rugby man ever can. A wonderful, powerful, mazy run at speed. He offloads to Sexton, who switches the play out right. Ireland keep pressing forward. This is a brilliant, free-flowing move by the Irish, which all started when Kearney snaffled a Scottish grubber kick down the right and went on a mazy run of his own. This deserves points. 50 min: Ireland don't get them, but it's oh so close. Sexton sends a crossfield kick to the right. It's caught by Bowe on the tryline, but he's held up by Morrison. Or is he? Bowe is lying on top of Morrison, on his back, but spins round and pops the ball down. However the video referee says he'd already made a movement for the line, and was held up. Cusiter replaces a haggered Blair. 52 min: Court is on for Healy, a blood sub. Scotland are somehow hanging onto this game by their fingernails. 53 min: Scotland have a lineout just outside the Irish 22. Some expansive passing from the right wing to the left, but Ireland clatter the Scots with a couple of big hits. Eventually, Denton and Laidlaw confuse each other down the left and in the resulting brouhaha the ball's knocked forward by Jones. 54 min: However, Bowe's hit Hogg, who didn't have the ball, and a penalty to the Scots. Laidlaw sends the ball out just inside the Irish 22 down the left. Can they trouble the scoreboard and get back into this? Meanwhile O'Gara, O'Leary and Cronin come on for D'Arcy, Reddan and Best. 55 min: O'Mahony rips the ball from Laidlaw's breast. Scotland won't be adding to their 14 points, good field position spurned. 56 min: Jackson replaces Laidlaw. 58 min: A lot of Scottish passing in the midfield. Gray nearly bursts through down the right. He's not released once felled. Jackson's first big play is to fail to find touch with the penalty. Oh dear. Vernon replaces Rennie. 59 min: A stitched-up Healy is back on for Court. 60 min: O'Gara is told that his players are getting on the wrong side far too often. Any more of it, and he'll be sending a green-shirted player to the sinbin. Kellock comes on for Hamilton. 62 min: Jones and Trimble smash into each other. Their heads clash. Trimble is OK, but Jones looks to have been knocked clean out as he stood, before falling to the turf, his head bouncing horribly off it. It may take a while to gather poor Jones up. It's still 62 min, with the quacks being about their business: As we wait for Jones to be loaded onto a stretcher, Jennings replaces O'Mahoney. And there's time to consider that, while it was nearly a point a minute in the first half, and four tries were scored, we're over halfway through the second period, and nothing's been added to the scoreline yet. A game of two halves indeed. Or a game of one half and another quarter. 63 min: Scott is on for Jones, who we're told is awake again, so good news there. 66 min: Ireland move the ball up into Scottish territory. They look dangerous for a while, Cronin so nearly jinking clear down the left, but eventually they refuse to release the ball once tackled, and still there's no score in this half. Scotland are holding on here gamely, but they really need something to happen soon. Sadly, Ireland are the team looking the stronger. 69 min: Scottish hands knock on in an attempt to gather a garryowen. Ireland will have more healthy field position. But they twist their scrum round, and Scotland get the put-in. There have been no points in this half! It's like watching rugby in the early 1960s. Sort of. 71 min: But we might have second-half points now. Penalty to Ireland as the Scots deliberately wheel a scrum round. It's far on the left touchline, but close enough to be very kickable. The stand-in captain O'Gara doesn't usurp Sexton, who will kick for goal. 72 min: PENALTY. IRELAND 25-14 Scotland. Sexton strokes a gorgeous kick straight between the posts. Wonderful. That pretty much seals the win, though to be fair that already looked pretty much in the bag. 73 min: YELLOW CARD! From the restart, Ireland gather the ball, and zip down the right. Earls kicks on and chases the ball over the tryline. Evans tugs him back. He's got to be sinbinned. And he is. No penalty try, though, as there was Scottish cover likely to arrive at the ball first. McFadden replaces Kearney, whose burst started this whole business off. 75 min: Seventeen minutes of this match - and our lives - have been spent buggering around in the scrum. Thanks, rugby! 77 min: TRY! IRELAND 30-14 Scotland. A lot of scampering around in front of the Scottish posts. McFadden picks the ball up, dives forward, and gets the ball down. Just. This is ending in quite an ugly fashion for Scotland, who started well. This is a recurring pattern for the Scots. 78 min: CONVERSION. IRELAND 32-14 Scotland. No problem for Sexton. FULL TIME: Ireland 32-14 Scotland. An interesting toe-to-toe battle in the first half, but Ireland ended up easy winners, and by far the better side. Ireland will look forward to embarrassing England at Twickenham; Scotland will be left to battle with Italy to avoid the wooden spoon.",

Scotland, on the other hand, are joint bottom of the table, after three defeats from three.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Yet you never know.</strong> Scotland have had an extra week to rest since their last game, have some fine fresh talent coming through in Stuart Hogg and David Denton, and are steadily (if slowly) improving, to the point that they've managed to cross the try line in their last two matches. Well done, everyone! Also, the last time these two teams met in Dublin, the Scots clocked up a rare away victory. Dan Parks put in a man-of-the-match performance, and if <em>that</em> can happen, etc., and so on...</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Karma dept.</strong> Scotland are due a bit of good fortune, having played better than their results suggest. But then Ireland are in credit with Lady Luck too after the Wales debacle. Ireland are favourites, so shouldn't need it, but we'll see.

That's how they roll. Incidentally, the Irish have been taking advice from Michael O'Leary, the grasping Ryanair footpad, who gave the team a motivational chat during the week. It's a wonder they're not stranded about 60 miles from the Aviva Stadium. Perhaps they'll charge Scotland \u00a310 for every tooth they manage to knock out, \u00a350+VAT per cauliflower ear.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>The anthems.</strong> They're singing them.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Greig Laidlaw gets the ball spinning - the thing won't roll - and Heaslip gathers. Scotland soon get the ball back, though, and will get the put-in at a scrum just inside the Irish half. A good minute or so is wasted with some tedious fannying around at the engagement. There goes that atmosphere! Lansdowne Road is as good as silent already.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> After two minutes of faffing around, Scotland are awarded a free kick. They move the ball out wide left towards Hogg, and nearly set the youngster off down the wing, but there's a forward pass. However, Bowe has drifted offside looking for an intercept, and that's a penalty to Scotland.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4 min: PENALTY. Ireland 0-3 SCOTLAND.</strong> Laidlaw hauds his baws for a few seconds, like a smutty Jonny Wilkinson, then strokes a kick between the posts. Scotland have the early lead.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Earls responds with a chip and chase down the left. Laidlaw is under it, and although clattered by Earls, keeps possession, allowing Scotland to move upfield. They're seeing most of the ball, and throwing it around quite nicely at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> They've made 38 passes compared to Ireland's four. The final one of those flies behind Hogg as they look to release Scotland's youngest starter for 40 years down the right.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10 min: PENALTY. Ireland 0-6 SCOTLAND.</strong> D'Arcy joins a ruck from the side. Nope. Penalty to Scotland, 30 yards from the posts, just to the left of the sticks. Laidlaw makes no mistake. The Scottish passing game isn't quite clicking, but it's been good enough; they've had all the possession, and this is a fair enough scoreline. Ireland are yet to turn up. I blame Michael O'Leary.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Turnover ball for Ireland just outside the Scottish 22, down the right. Ireland shuttle it out to the left, where a penalty's awarded, Rennie joining the ruck from the side. Will they kick? Nope. Sexton clips the ball into touch right by the left-hand corner. They've got a five-metre lineout, and really need points from this.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>14 min: TRY. IRELAND 5-6 Scotland.</strong> And they get them! The lineout's won, O'Callaghan moves the ball to the left touchline, and captain Best powers through Blair and over into the corner.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>15 min: CONVERSION. IRELAND 7-6 Scotland.</strong> Sexton steps up to take the conversion. He checks, turns, and begins again. Meanwhile Sean Lamont assumes Sexton's started his run, races out, in the style of that Zaire player at the 1974 Fifa World Cup, and hoofs the static ball upfield! Some light comedy.

After a shaky start, Ireland are slowly gaining the upper hand.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> The latest pass completion stat: Scotland 60, Ireland 15. But take a look at the scoreline.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Scotland concede a penalty on halfway, allowing Ireland to find touch by their 22. Ireland win the lineout, and go through a few phases, making their way deeper into the Scottish 22. The Scots are looking shaky, Ireland getting closer and closer, but Healy refuses to release, and concedes a pressure-releasing penalty. Scotland clear their lines to touch - but then lose their first lineout of the tournament, Ford throwing in a cack-handed ball.

McFadden picks the ball up, dives forward, and gets the ball down. Just. This is ending in quite an ugly fashion for Scotland, who started well. This is a recurring pattern for the Scots.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>78 min: CONVERSION. IRELAND 32-14 Scotland.</strong> No problem for Sexton.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Ireland 32-14 Scotland.</strong> An interesting toe-to-toe battle in the first half, but Ireland ended up easy winners, and by far the better side. Ireland will look forward to embarrassing England at Twickenham; Scotland will be left to battle with Italy to avoid the wooden spoon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats descended into open warfare over tax on Saturday as senior party figures reacted furiously to a call by Nick Clegg to back off their flagship plan for a \"mansion tax\" and push instead for a US-style \"tycoon tax\" on the rich. Clegg angered key figures close to the Lib Dem business secretary, Vince Cable, when he suggested the idea of a legally binding minimum rate of tax for \"tycoons\" was more of a priority than taxing homes worth over \u00a32m. In a speech to the Lib Dems' spring conference in Gateshead, Cable stoked the row by making clear that he was still in favour of the mansion tax rather than the new Clegg plan, on which he is said not to have been consulted by the party leader. He told the conference: \"We must insist on a radical plan for fair tax which we developed in opposition through the tax commission: lifting low earners out of tax and shifting the tax base from income to wealth, especially high-priced property.\" Cable also made a light-hearted reference to the \"mansion tax\" in his speech. \"On Thursday, I was the guest of the lord mayor of London at a fine banquet in the City. And as I looked around the Mansion House, all I could think of was \u2026 tax,\" he said. The row is a severe embarrassment to the Lib Dems, who had hoped to use the conference to present a united front on tax ahead of the 21 March budget. The Lib Dems want the chancellor, George Osborne, to raise the tax-free threshold \u2013 initially to about \u00a39,000, and then to \u00a310,000-plus before the next election. In a speech to his party, Clegg is expected to say that \"the budget in 10 days' time must offer concrete help to hard-pressed, hard-working families\" through a \"big increase in the income tax threshold further and faster towards \u00a310,000\". Lib Dems say the move could be paid for by higher taxes on the most wealthy, with Cable pressing for a tax on homes worth more than \u00a32m. But Clegg shifted his ground when he announced his \"tycoon tax\" idea in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. He said hundreds of millionaires were paying a tax rate of less than 20% on their earnings by employing an \"army of lawyers and accountants\". The answer, he suggested, would be to enforce a legally binding minimum rate of tax \u2013 probably between 20% and 30%. But Lord Oakeshott, a former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman who is seen as Cable's mouthpiece, accused Clegg of floating an unworkable idea and of bypassing the party's established policy-making structures. \"This is a superficially attractive idea that falls apart on close analysis,\" Oakeshott said. \"It does nothing to catch non-doms or non-residents. The US system is quite different from ours. We worked for years to produce a fair and robust tax policy. You can't invent Lib Dem policy on the hoof in the Daily Telegraph.\" A senior Liberal Democrat source dismissed Oakeshott's concerns. He said: \"I'm surprised it's him [Oakeshott] leading the defence of the tycoon tax dodgers. \"We'll let the Treasury see if the policy is workable; they tend to know more than a former Treasury spokesman.\" In the past 10 days, the Lib Dems have indicated they would be prepared to accept a cut in the 50p top rate of income tax \u2013 a key demand of many Tory MPs \u2013 in return for a wealth tax. Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow financial secretary, said few people would take Clegg's calls for fairness on tax seriously while the coalition was hitting the poor with cuts to tax credits. \"He is negotiating how to cut the 50p top rate of tax for the richest 1% while slashing tax credits by \u00a373 per week for working couples on the minimum wage. And he is the man who campaigned against a regressive rise in VAT, but then announced a VAT hike just weeks after becoming deputy prime minister,\" Leslie said.",

      "bodyText": "As early as the 18th minute, Wales were planting kickable penalties into the corner. The reward was a penalty from the passage of play that followed, a sitter that Leigh Halfpenny blasted over. The full-back makes no concession to distance, as if his intention is to kick the ball through the concrete bowl and out into central Cardiff. Rhys Priestland went for the corner again in the 21st minute, as if the spree was under way. The reward this time from the ensuing phases was a penalty to Italy and the score remained 6-3. Some spree. Italy were awarded a kickable penalty of their own in the 38th minute and opted to go for the corner themselves, as if they were trailing by so many that only clumps of points by the seven would help their cause. They came away with nothing and the score at half-time stood at 9-3. Some lost cause. Perhaps it was the sense of what was inevitably to come that persuaded both teams to force the issue of abandon. This was a game without foreplay, with Wales going through their entire repertoire of passing long, short, wide and narrow in the first minute alone. Barely had the ball landed from the kick-off than George North and Alex Cuthbert were bursting into midfield. Wales had all the ball, their failure at a couple of lineouts balanced by a pair of scrums when they shoved the Italian pack backwards. The only other threat to their absolute control of possession was the whistle of George Clancy, who was very strict about release at the breakdown and the body positions of those hitting the ruck. The case for taking the lineout before three points could be made by the wish for a higher rhythm. Quite why Italy were drawn into the corner game was less clear. The nearest they came to a break was at the start of the second half when Ian Evans dropped a pass and the visitors hoofed the ball downfield. Before that they had tried a couple of forward charges in midfield, only for Dan Lydiate to bowl over the ball-carrier. The No6 gave another outstanding display as the stopper in the back row. There had to come a time when he was not required in such all-consuming quantities. Alun Wyn Jones pounced on a stray ball and forced the turnover, and suddenly all the insistence on not stopping for breathers made sense. From the point of turnover Wales swept the ball wide, Jamie Roberts easing through a gap and leaving weary defenders behind. So far so good, according to the theory of how to beat Italy: keep on cranking up the speed until something gives. Now the final chapter could begin, piling on the pace and points. The finer points of the grand slam campaign are not quite as refined as the fitness levels of Wales. Their theories are not quite as imposing as their physical attributes. Referee Clancy had a part to play \u2013 he had a slightly exaggerated role here. Mirco Bergamasco, back on the wing and place-kicking duty, failed to catch a high ball. It bounced off his chest and he flapped at it with his right hand before it hit the ground. He made contact and Clancy, communicating with his touch judge, ruled it had not gone forward. The ball made its way to Halfpenny, who returned it even higher towards not Bergamasco but the mighty Sergio Parisse. Halfpenny ran and jumped and clattered into the Italian captain. The full-back was penalised and to compound the derision now aimed at Clancy, little Halfpenny, who barely comes to Parisse's knee, was sent to the sin-bin. In what was meant to be a dress rehearsal of celebration there was now an element of protest, as in the crowd expressing itself as Disgusted of Llandrindod Wells. The game turned scrappy, the sin-binning coinciding with all the replacements that come on the hour. Scott Williams made an impression, as he seems to do, and there was a first cap for scrum-half Rhys Webb. There were glimpses of the speed and wide range of skills of Justin Tipuric, but only flashes in the dying embers of an unsatisfactory occasion. That is, until Cuthbert converted the roars of protest into cheers. It meant the theory still stood and that speed and width would have their day. The theory of excitement and the reality of flatness in front of an irritated Millennium Stadium, pockmarked with empty seats. It does not matter. This was only a dress rehearsal and it will, according to another theory \u2013 that Wales on a roll and with a showdown at home are unstoppable \u2013 that all will be all fine on the day that does matter. Next Saturday is the one, when France come to town with the grand slam to play for and all the memories of Sam Warburton and the kicks that missed in the World Cup semi-final to be banished. Now that, unlike this, will be an occasion.",

      "bodyText": "Les Enfants Terribles, a chic restaurant in Paris's 12th arrondissement, was packed. Plates of halal foie gras \u00e0 la maison, halal braised lamb with rosemary, and halal caramelised duck were being dispatched to tables. Fresh fruit cocktails and exotic non-alcoholic concoctions replaced glasses of wine. Mohamed Abdenebi, 36, a history and geography teacher, was a typical diner: young, French, Muslim, dynamic \u2013 and furious. According to Abdenebi, France has let its Muslim population down. \"They said to us, 'Do your studies, and you will get a job.' We did our studies but there were no jobs and they said we hadn't done the right studies. Each time there was a new obstacle.\" Instead of being integrated and treated with equality, Abdenebi says the halal row shows the extent to which France's Muslims are being made to feel like \"the enemy within\". Similar complaints were being heard across France. President Nicolas Sarkozy's decision to make the labelling of halal meat pivotal to his re-election campaign has infuriated, alienated and dismayed France's Muslim community, which may number as many as six million, and the backlash is growing. Members of the booming educated and entrepreneurial Muslim middle class say they are tired of being cast as scapegoats in Sarkozy's wooing of the extreme right and have accused him of dangerous and divisive election tactics. Fateh Kimouche, a high-profile Muslim blogger, said the new class of second- and third-generation Muslims in France was not prepared to lie down and let the French republic roll over it as their parents had done. \"My parents came from Algeria and, like many others, they didn't make a fuss because they felt like invited guests who had to be on their best behaviour. But I was born here. We are Muslims and we are French, but every day we are attacked, insulted and treated like terrorists or extraterrestrials,\" he said. \"France educated us; we have energy and enthusiasm and we have brains, businesses and money. The old generation of politicians don't seem to realise this.\" The phoney war over halal meat erupted in February when Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National, claimed consumers were eating halal unknowingly. Sarkozy, trailing the Socialist frontrunner Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, accused her of whipping up an artificial controversy. Shortly afterwards, with Le Pen snapping at his heels in the opinion polls, Sarkozy performed a volte-face. In spite of surveys showing that voters were less concerned about halal meat than they were about the weather and football, he announced it was \"the issue that most preoccupies the French\". For France's Muslims \u2013 already feeling victimised by a burqa ban, by controversial government-sponsored debates on national identity and by the outlawing of Muslims praying in the streets, a sight Le Pen likened to the Nazi occupation \u2013 it was a low blow. Few believed that the halal uproar had anything to do with how animals are slaughtered or who eats them. \"It's a blatant attempt to divert attention away from the real problems,\" said Yanis Bouarbi, founder of the successful restaurant website paris-halal.com. \"You can have a debate about how animals are killed, but this is pure electioneering.\" Kimouche, 36, who has a degree in political philosophy, worked as a publisher's proofreader before he spotted the untapped business potential in France's nascent Muslim middle class. He left his job and started a profitable blog, al-Kanz, which covers all aspects of Muslim life and rituals, and boasts up to 10,000 visitors a day. \"Nicolas Sarkozy and Marine Le Pen have resorted to this because they have no solutions to the real problems. It's the last desperate thrashings of a mad dog that has nothing to lose,\" he said. \"It's part of a chain of thought that goes from halal meat to Islamism to terrorism.\" As he talks, Kimouche finds it hard to hide his anger and frustration at what he sees as a \"violent and populist\" presidential campaign. \"Really, we might have hoped for better from our politicians. I am a French Muslim, I love France, but I want to leave this country. Every day we are being attacked and insulted and we have had enough.\" In alienating Muslims such as Kimouche and Bouarbi, Sarkozy is ignoring the spending power \u2013 the halal market, for example, is growing at 20% a year more than organic food \u2013 of a socio-economic group that might otherwise have been tempted to vote for his business-friendly, free-market agenda. Kimouche points out that there is not one Muslim MP in the French parliament. \"In France, they say there are no communities within the republic, everyone is the same. But this is not true. No matter what we do, no matter how hard we try, we are seen as a fifth column, the enemy within, a threat, a menace.\" France has failed to learn the lesson of its history, says Abdenebi: \"In 1939 when there was an economic crisis, the enemy was the Jews. Today there is a crisis and it is the Muslims. It's the same discrimination, just a different community.\" Kamel Saidi, 34, the softly spoken owner of Les Enfants Terribles, says he finds the political atmosphere \"revolting and tiring\". And he cannot see the situation improving. \"People feel afraid because today the party of the right is adopting the ideas of the extreme right. What's even more worrying is that this attitude is not going to change, certainly not in the near future. \"It is depressing that all we are trying to do is find our place in society, and there is no recognition of this, just suspicion. Once again, it's as if the whole Muslim community is suspect.\" Abdenebi is slightly less pessimistic: \"There is hope for change, but I don't see it happening for at least 50 years\u2026 maybe 100.\"",

      "body": "<p>Les Enfants Terribles, a chic restaurant in Paris's 12th arrondissement, was packed. Plates of halal <em>foie gras \u00e0 la maison</em>, halal braised lamb with rosemary, and halal caramelised duck were being dispatched to tables. Fresh fruit cocktails and exotic non-alcoholic concoctions replaced glasses of wine.</p> <p>Mohamed Abdenebi, 36, a history and geography teacher, was a typical diner: young, French, Muslim, dynamic \u2013 and furious. According to Abdenebi, France has let its Muslim population down. \"They said to us, 'Do your studies, and you will get a job.' We did our studies but there were no jobs and they said we hadn't done the right studies. Each time there was a new obstacle.\"</p> <p>Instead of being integrated and treated with equality, Abdenebi says the halal row shows the extent to which France's Muslims are being made to feel like \"the enemy within\".</p> <p>Similar complaints were being heard across France. President Nicolas Sarkozy's decision to make the labelling of halal meat pivotal to his re-election campaign has infuriated, alienated and dismayed France's Muslim community, which may number as many as six million, and the backlash is growing. Members of the booming educated and entrepreneurial Muslim middle class say they are tired of being cast as scapegoats in Sarkozy's wooing of the extreme right and have accused him of dangerous and divisive election tactics.</p> <p>Fateh Kimouche, a high-profile Muslim blogger, said the new class of second- and third-generation Muslims in France was not prepared to lie down and let the French republic roll over it as their parents had done.</p> <p>\"My parents came from Algeria and, like many others, they didn't make a fuss because they felt like invited guests who had to be on their best behaviour. But I was born here. We are Muslims and we are French, but every day we are attacked, insulted and treated like terrorists or extraterrestrials,\" he said. \"France educated us; we have energy and enthusiasm and we have brains, businesses and money. The old generation of politicians don't seem to realise this.\"</p> <p>The phoney war over halal meat erupted in February when Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National, claimed consumers were eating halal unknowingly. Sarkozy, trailing the Socialist frontrunner Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, accused her of whipping up an artificial controversy. Shortly afterwards, with Le Pen snapping at his heels in the opinion polls, Sarkozy performed a volte-face. In spite of surveys showing that voters were less concerned about halal meat than they were about the weather and football, he announced it was \"the issue that most preoccupies the French\".</p> <p>For France's Muslims \u2013 already feeling victimised by a burqa ban, by controversial government-sponsored debates on national identity and by the outlawing of Muslims praying in the streets, a sight Le Pen likened to the Nazi occupation \u2013 it was a low blow.</p> <p>Few believed that the halal uproar had anything to do with how animals are slaughtered or who eats them. \"It's a blatant attempt to divert attention away from the real problems,\" said Yanis Bouarbi, founder of the successful restaurant website <a href=\"http://paris-halal.com/\" title=\"\">paris-halal.com</a>. \"You can have a debate about how animals are killed, but this is pure electioneering.\"</p> <p>Kimouche, 36, who has a degree in political philosophy, worked as a publisher's proofreader before he spotted the untapped business potential in France's nascent Muslim middle class. He left his job and started a profitable blog, <em>al-Kanz</em>, which covers all aspects of Muslim life and rituals, and boasts up to 10,000 visitors a day.</p> <p>\"Nicolas Sarkozy and Marine Le Pen have resorted to this because they have no solutions to the real problems. It's the last desperate thrashings of a mad dog that has nothing to lose,\" he said. \"It's part of a chain of thought that goes from halal meat to Islamism to terrorism.\"</p> <p>As he talks, Kimouche finds it hard to hide his anger and frustration at what he sees as a \"violent and populist\" presidential campaign. \"Really, we might have hoped for better from our politicians. I am a French Muslim, I love France, but I want to leave this country. Every day we are being attacked and insulted and we have had enough.\"</p> <p>In alienating Muslims such as Kimouche and Bouarbi, Sarkozy is ignoring the spending power \u2013 the halal market, for example, is growing at 20% a year more than organic food \u2013 of a socio-economic group that might otherwise have been tempted to vote for his business-friendly, free-market agenda.</p> <p>Kimouche points out that there is not one Muslim MP in the French parliament. \"In France, they say there are no communities within the republic, everyone is the same. But this is not true. No matter what we do, no matter how hard we try, we are seen as a fifth column, the enemy within, a threat, a menace.\"</p> <p>France has failed to learn the lesson of its history, says Abdenebi: \"In 1939 when there was an economic crisis, the enemy was the Jews. Today there is a crisis and it is the Muslims. It's the same discrimination, just a different community.\"</p> <p>Kamel Saidi, 34, the softly spoken owner of Les Enfants Terribles, says he finds the political atmosphere \"revolting and tiring\". And he cannot see the situation improving. \"People feel afraid because today the party of the right is adopting the ideas of the extreme right. What's even more worrying is that this attitude is not going to change, certainly not in the near future.</p> <p>\"It is depressing that all we are trying to do is find our place in society, and there is no recognition of this, just suspicion. Once again, it's as if the whole Muslim community is suspect.\"</p> <p>Abdenebi is slightly less pessimistic: \"There is hope for change, but I don't see it happening for at least 50 years\u2026 maybe 100.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shirley Williams, the Liberal Democrat grandee, spoke on Saturday of her anger over personal attacks unleashed by opponents of the NHS reforms, as Lib Dem delegates dropped a vote on killing the health bill. She said she had been falsely accused of \"stitching up\" a deal to save the controversial bill and described how she was fighting an \"uphill battle for the truth\", challenging lies about the legislation on Twitter and the media. Baroness Williams, initially an opponent of the NHS reforms, has become a supporter in recent weeks following more than a thousand amendments in the Lords which she says have changed the bill \"significantly\". However, critics claim she has been used by the Lib Dem leadership to usher the bill into law. While delegates at the Lib Dem spring conference in Gateshead decided against voting on a \"kill the bill\" emergency motion, there is still considerable anger in the party. More than 270 delegates voted in favour of the \"kill the bill\" motion in a sign that will worry the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, as he tries to carry his party with him on the policy. Instead of the \"kill the bill\" motion, activists will vote on the alternative, backed by the leadership, which suggests the bill as amended should now be passed. Although it is possible that this motion could be defeated, this would be far less embarrassing for Clegg than a vote to drop the bill altogether. One of the most vociferous critics of the bill, Charles West, a former Lib Dem parliamentary candidate for Shrewsbury, said he believed Williams was wrong. \"I think Shirley Williams is a very able politician, but she doesn't understand the NHS or the health bill,\" West said. He added that she had been persuaded that \"it will all be fine\" but that she was \"wrong on the details\". West's comments followed a row on Twitter in which party members accused the leadership of manipulating a \"national treasure\" to support the health bill. Williams responded by saying she was \"against personal attacks\" and believed her critics were \"behind the facts\" on the bill. Talking to delegates, she said: \"We are fighting an uphill battle for the truth, to be able to base people's opinions on facts, and not on the stuff they have presented on Twitter and tweet and, dare I say it, the new social network, which is known as twist. \"My view about the coalition, which is bloody difficult, is you get in very early on legislation you don't like which is why the prelegislative phase is very difficult. It is damned hard work but we know now we can change legislation out of all recognition.\" Williams also cited a column by the Guardian's Polly Toynbee as an example of the \"tribalism trumping truth\". Williams told a fringe meeting: \"I have to say this morning I am extremely angry. Yesterday you may have read in the Guardian a story from Polly Toynbee which began with the following sentence: 'Yesterday Shirley Williams led her erstwhile rebels into the government lobby to vote for a hospital's rights to use 49% of beds for private patients.' \"There has never been a right for hospitals to offer 49% of their places for private patients. The so-called 49% is a myth or, to put it in non-parliamentary language, a lie. \"Now, I know Polly well. She's a very able journalist. Either she just did not look at the detail and therefore is able to say that in the Guardian, or she did look at the detail and decided that tribalism should trump truth.\" Williams added: \"I want to see Polly Toynbee in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column.\" On a visit to Siemens in Newcastle, Clegg said he hoped that the party would in time see what changes had been made to the health reforms and the need for legislation. He said: \"I think it is quite right that people have a look at it. \"My own view is that when people look at what we have done \u2013 rather than what we are alleged to have done, because many of the critics I speak to about the bill, when I ask them if they have read the health bill, they say they haven't \u2013 I think there is a big gap between what people think the bill is going to do and what it actually says.\" Paul Burstow, the Lib Dem health minister criticised by several colleagues for failing to halt the bill sooner, pleaded with activists to recognise that reform was needed because of a \"postcode lottery\" in the NHS. \"What this legislation will do is cast a light on the system. It will save lives and reduce the amount of unnecessary disability and misery.\" However other senior members of the party continue to criticise the bill. John Pugh, a Lib Dem MP, said: \"I know Nick Clegg says we should stop looking in the rear view mirror. But if you don't look in it sometimes you end up heading into more car crashes.\"",

Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 11 February 2012 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D7000 Question: This small Chinese mystery bird is showing up in the most unlikely places all over the world. Why? Can you identify this bird's taxonomic family and species? Is it male or female? Response: This is an orange-flanked bush-robin, Luscinia cyanura, probably a first-winter male. This small insectivorous songbird is migratory, wintering mainly in northern Asia, India and Taiwan. They breed in mixed coniferous forests of northern Asia and northeastern Europe, all the way from Finland to Kamchatka and into Japan. Their breeding range is expanding. They'e recently been showing up in Great Britain, and are now are popping up in western Alaska, too. This is a cavity-nesting species. They nests in holes in bank sides or under tree roots or logs. The female lays up to four pale blue eggs per clutch. Orange-flanked bush-robins are shy, often remain hidden, even whilst singing. Here's a nice audio recording of a singing male orange-flanked bush-robin, accompanied by a photograph (recorded in Lieksa, Pohjois-Karjala, Suomi/Finland; uploaded 10 January 2010): Visit kuujussi's YouTube channel [video link]. The female orange-flanked bush-robin has olive-brown upperparts, white throat, orangish-red flanks, a bright blue rump and tail. Her bill is black and there is a thin white ring around her black eyes. The male has brilliant blue upperparts and often a pale blue or blue-grey supercilium, but otherwise, resembles the female. Here's an informational video accompanying footage of a female orange-flanked bush-robin (filmed in Taiwan, uploaded 10 December 2010): Visit hikasiaorg's YouTube channel [video link]. The taxonomy of this species is confusing. The orange-flanked bush-robin is often placed into the genus, Tarsiger, although its placement is dependent upon whom you are arguing with at the moment since it appears that the authorities are more or less equally split regarding this bird's relationships. Tarsiger is a genus comprising six species of passerines in the taxonomic family, Muscicapidae (Old World flycatchers). These birds are small, mostly brightly coloured insectivorous birds native to Asia and northeastern Europe; and most of them are reside in the mountains. Even though Tarsiger forms a distinct monophyletic group, it is sometimes subsumed into the related genus Luscinia. Luscinia is a genus comprising eleven species of nightingales and their relatives, also in Muscicapidae. There is a lot of overlap between these two taxa, which some authorities merge. Further, as if that isn't confusing enough, authorities have long been confused as to precisely where Luscinia ends and another genus, Erithacus, begins. In fact, a number of taxa were dumped into one genus or the other, or the Luscinia was merged into Erithacus. The one thing that appears consistent is that the orange-flanked bush-robin was never been placed into Erithacus. But the confusion regarding the placement of the orange-flanked bush-robin extends beyond its generic placement, too. Originally, the orange-flanked bush-robin and its close relatives were placed into the thrush family Turdidae, although these birds are now thought to be chats (subfamily: Saxicolinae) that are part of the Old World flycatcher family.

There is a lot of overlap between these two taxa, which some authorities merge. </p> <p>Further, as if that isn't confusing enough, authorities have long been confused as to precisely where <em>Luscinia</em> ends and another genus, <em>Erithacus</em>, begins. In fact, a number of taxa were dumped into one genus or the other, or the <em>Luscinia</em> was merged into <em>Erithacus</em>. The one thing that appears consistent is that the orange-flanked bush-robin was never been placed into <em>Erithacus</em>. </p> <p>But the confusion regarding the placement of the orange-flanked bush-robin extends beyond its generic placement, too. Originally, the orange-flanked bush-robin and its close relatives were placed into the thrush family Turdidae, although these birds are now thought to be chats (subfamily: Saxicolinae) that are part of the Old World flycatcher family. </p> <p>You are invited to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/mystery-bird\">review all of the daily mystery birds</a> by going to their dedicated graphic index page. </p> <p>If you have bird images, video or audio files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at <em>The Guardian</em>, feel free to contact me to learn more. </p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>twitter: @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/GrrlScientist\">GrrlScientist</a> <br>facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grrlscientist\">grrlscientist</a> <br>email: <a href=\"mailto:grrlscientist@gmail.com\">grrlscientist@gmail.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Watch out West Ham and Southampton: Reading are right behind you \u2013 and they are on a roll. With this accomplished performance they racked up their eighth win in a row and drained yet more momentum from wealthy Leicester City, whose own promotion ambitions now look fanciful. Reading's run has propelled them from eighth to third in just six weeks. Having lost in the play-off final last season, they are evidently determined to bypass that trial by going up automatically this time. Their manager, Brian McDermott, named an unchanged line-up for the third consecutive match and their fluency was evident. Both teams deployed the same formation \u2013 4-4-2 \u2013 but what distinguished the hosts was the smoothness of their movements, the intermittent trickery of Noel Hunt and Jobi McAnuff, and, most of all, the solidity of a rearguard that has now conceded just two goals in eight games. It took a pair of goalline clearances to prevent Reading from taking the lead after eight minutes, Wes Morgan and Sean St Ledger repelling shots by Mikele Leigertwood and Hunt. Reading kept the pressure on and two minutes later goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel had to beat away Alex Pearce's close-range header following a corner. For all that, Reading did not dominate. Leicester had spells of good possession but were afforded few chances to shoot. Reading's defence lapsed only once in the opening period, allowing St Ledger a free header from six yards in the 14th minute but he nodded wide. One minute later Reading were in front. Hunt destabilised Leicester's defence with a cunning piece of skill down the left and then sent in a cross that ran all the way to McAnuff at the far side of the box. The midfielder teed up Leigertwood, who spanked the ball into the top corner from 20 yards. Not until the second period did Leicester's top scorer, David Nugent, get a look-in but after dashing into the box he directed his 16-yard shot way wide. He missed by even more in the 58th minute after a dainty one-two with Richie Wellens. Leicester have invested heavily in an effort to achieve promotion this season and they knew that hope would recede if they followed up Tuesday's reverse at Bristol City with a loss here. Their play became more urgent but continued to founder against the Reading rearguard. Then the hosts re-asserted themselves. Schmeichel had to scoot off his line to save well from Hunt in the 68th minute but he was helpless six minutes later when Hunt crossed from the right and Roberts finished smartly from six yards. Roberts was replaced after that by Simon Church, who soon replicated his goal, converting another Hunt cross from similar range in the 89th minute. In the dying seconds Neil Danns fired a loose ball into the net from 10 yards. That was no consolation for the Leicester manager, Nigel Pearson, who fumed: \"We were poor in the first half, there was a lack of application and when there is so much riding on a game that's not acceptable. I'll be making changes for the next game.\" McDermott was more upbeat. \"People have been saying that we haven't been playing that well during our run but I don't think they could say that after this game,\" beamed the man whose team is now out of the automatic promotion places on goal difference only. \"I don't even look at that,\" he claimed. \"I just concentrate on preparing the team.\"",

      "bodyText": "Peter Paphides, music writer To be a national treasure you have to be likable. Is Morrissey likable any more? I'm almost loth to say that he isn't, because to do so would be to play into the persecution complex he has been nurturing for the best part of his solo career. Even when he makes pronouncements that, broadly speaking, I agree with, there's something about the way he makes them that makes me recoil. I'm not a royalist, but pictures of his band lined up either side of him on his recent Argentinian tour, wearing \"We hate William and Kate\" T-shirts, momentarily made me feel like becoming one. What made the picture fascinating though wasn't the T-shirts but a) the body language of the musicians wearing them, reminiscent of temps who turn up to the agency only to be handed GOLF SALE sandwich boards; and b) the fact that Morrissey deemed himself exempt from the dress code, preserving his own vanity. Morrissey opposes British occupation of the Falklands. It's a perfectly reasonable opinion. But it's also a classic example of a very Morrissey-ish trope, invoking a wider enemy to endear his immediate fanbase to him. He's always used his fanbase as a sort of human shield. What's interesting is that \u2013 as the picture shows \u2013 he's now started doing it with his band. Fine if you believe it, but for heaven's sake, don't make your band do it. Sukhdev Sandhu, cultural critic For sure, that William and Kate image is truly horrid. And that's odd, as Morrissey is usually very adept at coming up with grabby soundbites, striking photographic images, social-media carrion. Morrissey is a sort of national treasure, but whether he wants to be is another matter. Calling someone a national treasure is just a way of trying to rein in the awkward squad, to make the likes of, say, Alan Bennett or Jarvis Cocker appear less truculent or outsider-ish than they really are. And Morrissey, whether or not you like his music, has always been about outsiderdom. He \u2013 like Johnny Marr \u2013 has Irish parents. Coming from the north, he's sensitive to the ways in which Englishness is all too often a codeword for home counties. For years he's lived abroad. He's always had an ambiguous relationship with national identity, and these days his most passionate fans are as likely to be Mexicans or Argentinians as they are English. So I wonder not only if he gives a damn about being seen as a national treasure, but whether to give him that accolade would actually be the ultimate insult. PP I certainly think Morrissey wants to be given that accolade, if only to make a great show of rejecting it. He is, in essence, driven by revenge. He wants the last word. \"I do feel as though I have been somewhat victimised,\" he told Mojo a few years ago. But what has he been \"victimised\" for? The 1992 show where he sang \"The National Front Disco\" draped in a union flag seems to have been a turning point. At the time, I was one of the few people in the music press who felt that Morrissey should have been given the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps he was trying to make some arcane point about the nature of Britishness to a park full of Madness fans. In retrospect, though, it seems pretty clear that he was defying people to misunderstand him, fattening his persecution complex in the process and intensifying his disciples' love for him. Yes, he might refer to the Chinese as a \"subspecies\" but I don't think he's a racist. I think he hates all humans equally. His outsiderdom is a function of his misanthropy. And his vegetarianism is the expedient by which he justifies that misanthropy. For all of that, it isn't hard to see why he keeps his dislike of people close to him. It's almost exclusively where his music comes from now. Indeed, on his last album, Years Of Refusal, it was hard not to summon a strange awe at the venal sentiments of \"It's Not Your Birthday Anymore\" or the victorious spite of \"All You Need Is Me\". By the same token, you wonder what happened to the person who sang \"It takes strength to be gentle and kind\" (\"I Know It's Over\"). I suspect Morrissey would deem him naive. So, no: I don't think it's a northern thing. Nor do I think it's a way of keeping his edge. I think he's just allowed himself to become as much of a tosspot as he thinks everyone else is. SS You're right, Morrissey's vegetarianism and pro-animal rights passions do seem, as with someone like Brigitte Bardot, to go hand-in-hand with some very dark and often stupid \"political\" statements. As for his music, well I'm not alone in thinking he needs to fire his band, work with better collaborators, and basically have a major rethink (maybe his next LP should be crooner ballads?). He's a stubborn sort and it's probably too late. Yet the fact that he's always in the news these days speaks volumes about how boring and tongue-tied a lot of modern pop stars are. Watching the Brits and the Grammys and even the NME awards this year has been utterly dispiriting: it's not that you expect Ed Sheeran or Serge from Kasabian to have a position on the Greek debt crisis or do some point-by-point takedown of George Osborne's austerity cuts programme, but if only they would say something \u2013 anything \u2013 weird, witty, contentious. Perhaps Morrissey is a British Serge Gainsbourg: he's sharp and embarrassing in equal measure, good silly-season-all-year-round fare for the press. PP He's not sharp though. The issues that bug him are the same issues that bugged him 30 years ago. Animal rights. The Falklands. He even moans about the manufactured pop in the charts. Not so long ago, he wrote a song about it \u2013 \"The World is Full of Crashing Bores\" \u2013 which suggests that he believes all the 13-year-olds on the top deck of the bus should have him blaring out of their phones instead of Tinchy Stryder. I really don't think Ed Sheeran's blandness makes Morrissey's willingness to bark from the pop sidelines any more palatable. These days, when Morrissey opens his mouth, the scale of his delusions is embarrassing. The world is only as generous and yielding a place as the outlook you bring to bear upon it. Ironically, there's no better example of that than Moz's ex-pal Johnny Marr \u2013 a musician whose absence of rancour seems to define him. (And if Morrissey's vegetarianism seems inseparable from his dislike of people, Marr's veganism is no less a function of that joie de vivre.) I understand how Morrissey gradually turned into a post-punk Count Olaf. I understand also that it helps him (barely) function as an artist, albeit a pantomime version of his former self. But it diminishes him as a person. Oh, and by the way, Vauxhall And I wipes the floor with Viva Hate. SS A lot of the issues that riled Morrissey in the 80s are no less important today. \"Cameron on the Guillotine\" has a certain ring to it. Johnny Marr's recent proposition \u2013 \"If this government steps down then I'll reform the band. How's that?\" \u2013 was well-made. Though I don't believe in national treasures, and think pop \u2013 like the nation \u2013 is so atomised that it's almost impossible for a musician to occupy that notional role, it's far preferable to have Morrissey as a quasi-collective talisman than, say, Adele, who sounds like a 1970s prog-rock inflatosaurus when she moans about having to pay 50% taxes.",

The issues that bug him are the same issues that bugged him 30 years ago. Animal rights. The Falklands. He even moans about the manufactured pop in the charts. Not so long ago, he wrote a song about it \u2013 \"The World is Full of Crashing Bores\" \u2013 which suggests that he believes all the 13-year-olds on the top deck of the bus should have <em>him</em> blaring out of their phones instead of Tinchy Stryder. I really don't think Ed Sheeran's blandness makes Morrissey's willingness to bark from the pop sidelines any more palatable.</p> <p>These days, when Morrissey opens his mouth, the scale of his delusions is embarrassing. The world is only as generous and yielding a place as the outlook you bring to bear upon it. Ironically, there's no better example of that than Moz's ex-pal Johnny Marr \u2013 a musician whose absence of rancour seems to define him. (And if Morrissey's vegetarianism seems inseparable from his dislike of people, Marr's veganism is no less a function of that joie de vivre.) I understand how Morrissey gradually turned into a post-punk Count Olaf. I understand also that it helps him (barely) function as an artist, albeit a pantomime version of his former self. But it diminishes him as a person. Oh, and by the way, <em>Vauxhall And I</em> wipes the floor with <em>Viva Hate</em>.</p> <p><strong>SS</strong> A lot of the issues that riled Morrissey in the 80s are no less important today. \"Cameron on the Guillotine\" has a certain ring to it. Johnny Marr's recent proposition \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/02/johnny-marr-smiths-reform-government\" title=\"\">If&#xa0;this government steps down then I'll reform the band. How's that</a>?\" \u2013 was well-made. Though I don't believe in national treasures, and think pop \u2013 like the nation \u2013 is so atomised that it's almost impossible for a musician to occupy that notional role, it's far preferable to have Morrissey as a quasi-collective talisman than, say, Adele, who sounds like a 1970s prog-rock inflatosaurus when she moans about having to pay 50% taxes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British rowing took its first steps towards a high-rev Olympic summer with the start of the Great Britain Team Senior Trials here. On a cold grey Saturday morning it was impossible not to draw a comparison between the handful of dog-walkers and devotees on the banks of the Eton College rowing lake and what, come August, seems certain to be one of the most super-heated occasions of the summer, with hospitality tickets for this venue already changing hands at just shy of \u00a31,000 a head. With the biggest occasion in its history five months away there were reassuring turns on the course from the star names on the Team GB roster. The unbeaten world champion women's double sculls pair, Anna Watkins and Katherine Grainger, are racing each other in the women's time trial: Grainger won the opening heat narrowly from Frances Houghton with Watkins two seconds back in third. \"It's strange because you want to go as fast as you can here, but you also want each other to do well,\" Grainger said. \"It's mixed feelings because neither of us wants to see the other lose. You're always looking out for each other.\" Grainger and Watkins will now compete in Sunday's six-woman time-trail final before \u2013 all being well \u2013 pairing up again for the pre-Olympic events and the return in expectant glory to Berkshire in August. As such there is an unavoidable element of dress rehearsal about Sunday's finals, which are expected to draw a sizeable crowd. \"We don't often come to race at Eton Dorney and that's partly deliberate. It's got to have something special to it,\" Grainger said. \"Even coming here today they're building the bridge across the lake and they're putting the giant screen up. These little things all remind you that this is where it's all going to happen in a few months' time.\" In a sport tied above all to the four-yearly spike of Olympic fever the trials are inevitably part of a process of visualisation for the British team ahead of the summer Games. As Watkins said: \"It's slightly bizarre. We're here every year and there's sudden great rise and fall of interest and we're the constants underneath all that. It trains you to be self-reliant, to do it whether people are shouting or not, if there's a crowd or nobody at all.\" Another of Britain's star names, Alan Campbell, finished first in his heat and will renew his rivalry with Matt Wells, hoping to win here for the eighth year in a row . For Campbell, a famously extreme trainer who spent Christmas morning running up a frozen sand dune, chopping logs and hefting sandbags, the pressures of Eton Dorney in summertime are unlikely to hold overwhelming terrors. \"There is a lot of talk about a home Olympics,\" Campbell said after recording the fastest time of the morning by three seconds. \"But it's just going to make it that bit more exciting. I remember Beijing, the last 500 metres was just like a wall of noise, you just felt so lifted, and we've got a really strong concentration of rowing supporters here in the Thames Valley.

      "bodyText": "Barring any untoward events in the final nine-kilometre time trial, Bradley Wiggins is set to clinch the second major stage race win of his career on Sunday in the Paris-Nice \"race to the sun\". Sunday's contre-la-montre travels uphill out of Nice, to a stage finish high on the coast en route to Monaco, on the Col d'Eze, a location that served as the climax to the \"race to the sun\" from 1969 to 1995, witnessing victories by greats such as Eddy Merckx, Miguel Indurain, Stephen Roche and Sean Kelly. The triple Olympic champion lies six seconds ahead of the Dutchman Lieuwe Westra but has a better time trial pedigree, which should assure him victory in the eight-day event, nine months after he landed the Dauphine Libere race in the French Alps. Until this year, only one Briton \u2013 Chris Boardman in 1996 \u2013 had even come close to emulating the legendary Tom Simpson, winner of the \"race to the sun\" in 1967, but Wiggins has looked untouchable since he rode into the race lead on Monday. On Saturday he finished in the main pack when the race arrived in Nice, more than nine minutes behind the lone-stage winner Thomas De Gendt of Belgium, not remotely a threat overall, and the author of a classic long-range move through the Riviera hills. However seamless Wiggins's week may have looked on the outside, though, riding for the podium in any stage race is never straightforward, and he has had to remain constantly vigilant. The fate of the American Levi Leipheimer, a seasoned stage racer who started the stage in third place overall, served as a reminder of the dangers that lurk at every corner, on every downhill. Like Wiggins, he had ridden faultlessly all week, and he started the weekend with a chance of overtaking the Londoner in the final time trial. Leipheimer fell early in the stage to no ill effect, but was involved in a second chute as the peloton hurtled down towards the Mediterranean from the Col de Vence, the last major climb of the race. The descent from the Vence drops some 3,000 feet in about 25 miles on roads that constantly twist and turn, and can be made slippery even in the dry due to oil and fuel from the heavy traffic on the Riviera.

      "body": "<p>Barring any untoward events in the final nine-kilometre time trial, Bradley Wiggins is set to clinch the second major stage race win of his career on Sunday in the Paris-Nice \"race to the sun\". Sunday's contre-la-montre travels uphill out of Nice, to a stage finish high on the coast en route to Monaco, on the Col d'Eze, a location that served as the climax to the \"race to the sun\" from 1969 to 1995, witnessing victories by greats such as Eddy Merckx, Miguel Indurain, Stephen Roche and Sean Kelly.</p> <p>The triple Olympic champion lies six seconds ahead of the Dutchman Lieuwe Westra but has a better time trial pedigree, which should assure him victory in the eight-day event, nine months after he landed the Dauphine Libere race in the French Alps. Until this year, only one Briton \u2013 Chris Boardman in 1996 \u2013 had even come close to emulating the legendary Tom Simpson, winner of the \"race to the sun\" in 1967, but Wiggins has looked untouchable since he rode into the race lead on Monday.</p> <p>On Saturday he finished in the main pack when the race arrived in Nice, more than nine minutes behind the lone-stage winner Thomas De Gendt of Belgium, not remotely a threat overall, and the author of a classic long-range move through the Riviera hills. However seamless Wiggins's week may have looked on the outside, though, riding for the podium in any stage race is never straightforward, and he has had to remain constantly vigilant.</p> <p>The fate of the American Levi Leipheimer, a seasoned stage racer who started the stage in third place overall, served as a reminder of the dangers that lurk at every corner, on every downhill. Like Wiggins, he had ridden faultlessly all week, and he started the weekend with a chance of overtaking the Londoner in the final time trial. Leipheimer fell early in the stage to no ill effect, but was involved in a second <em>chute</em> as the peloton hurtled down towards the Mediterranean from the Col de Vence, the last major climb of the race.</p> <p>The descent from the Vence drops some 3,000 feet in about 25 miles on roads that constantly twist and turn, and can be made slippery even in the dry due to oil and fuel from the heavy traffic on the Riviera. As Leipheimer struggled to regain contact with the field together with four team-mates, the Movistar squad of Alejandro Valverde \u2013 who had started the stage immediately behind the American in the standings \u2013 set a searing pace, to keep their rival under maximum pressure.</p> <p>The intention would not have been to force him into an error, but more likely to make the American spend as much energy as possible less than 24 hours before the final time trial.

      "bodyText": "This was not a performance to have the Napoli scouts trembling, ahead of the Champions League last 16 showdown here on Wednesday night, but for Roberto Di Matteo and everyone connected with Chelsea, the result was everything. After the angst of recent weeks, on and off the field, which culminated in the sacking of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas last Sunday, there was comfort to be located in a narrow victory. Chelsea's fourth Premier League win in 13 attempts was secured by Didier Drogba's neatly taken goal against a Stoke team that played for 69 minutes with 10 men. Ricardo Fuller's dismissal for an inexcusable stamp on Branislav Ivanovic was foolish in the extreme and it drew condemnation from his manager Tony Pulis. Di Matteo's team dominated without ever truly quickening the pulse, although they did hit the woodwork three times and create chances, particularly in the first half. The football was formulaic; the tempo and the excitement value low. Chelsea, though, would argue that it was not their fault and that they did everything to force the issue. Stoke tend to play a certain way on their travels and when they must fight without the full compliment, their backs become pinned even more closely to the wall. Di Matteo noted the difficulty in breaking them down, even before the sending-off. It always felt as though one goal would prove decisive and it came when the substitute Juan Mata found Drogba with an incisive pass. The Ivorian's first touch looked heavy but his second took him around the Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. His third brought up his 100th Premier League goal and saw him become the first African player to reach the landmark. The club must surely endeavour to ensure that he does not leave on a free transfer in the summer. \"Sometimes during the season, you have to win like this,\" Di Matteo said. \"It's not always going to be easy or pretty. We scored goals against Bolton, for example, but sometimes you have to win a bit scrappy. It was a big goal for Didier and for the team. His contract is a club matter. Didier has been a tremendous player for this club.\" Di Matteo's caretaker charge has started in solid fashion. The victory followed the 2-0 success at Birmingham City in the FA Cup last Tuesday. \"It's two wins, two clean sheets: you gain confidence and belief from that,\" he said. But he was clear that a more impressive performance would be needed against Napoli to overturn the 3-1 first-leg deficit. The game was shaped by Fuller's sending-off, although Di Matteo noted that Stoke played with two deep-lying banks of four throughout. Fuller had already tangled with Ivanovic in his own half when he contested a ball with the Serb deep in Chelsea territory. Ivanovic did raise his leg to make contact with Fuller's shin, after the ball had gone, but Fuller's reaction, aiming a vicious stamp at Ivanovic's nether regions, was disproportionate and gave the referee Andre Marriner no option. The old joke about the player getting the ball did not help to remove the water from Ivanovic's eyes. Nor was it any way for Fuller to mark his first Premier League start since New Year's Day 2011. \"That makes it doubly disappointing,\" Pulis said. \"It was a ridiculous reaction from Ric. He is prone to that. He's a great lad and he was the first to apologise to everyone in the dressing room. But it was unacceptable. We will see whether I fine him. Everything we do will be within the football club.\" Chelsea did everything but score in the first-half of a muscular contest and most of the clearest chances fell to Ivanovic. The defender thumped a free header from Frank Lampard's corner over the crossbar; he drew a save from Begovic with a looping header, following more prompting from Lampard and, on 41 minutes, he rattled the bar after Robert Huth's poor clearance. John Terry, who returned unscathed after his knee operation, also hit the bar, with a header from another Lampard corner while Gary Cahill, preferred to David Luiz at the start, tested Begovic from distance, and Ryan Shawcross almost put through his own goal with a backwards header. For Stoke, Jon Walters had a shot blocked by Cahill in the 17th minute. Mata started on the bench as Di Matteo sought greater physicality \u2013 yet the substitutions were positive and Chelsea were on the front foot throughout. Stoke, though, who resemble a team of man-mountains, do not give an easy ride. Chelsea had been restricted to efforts from distance in the second half, although Drogba's free-kick drew an excellent save from Begovic and there was the sense that they were beginning to labour when they fashioned the breakthrough. The relief was palpable. Stoke's response was a speculative effort from Andy Wilkinson from the halfway line that was not too far away and a shot from the substitute Cameron Jerome that flashed wide. Mata's curling free-kick from 25 yards hit the post and Daniel Sturridge, also on from the bench, went close. It was never going to be pretty. Nobody in Chelsea blue could grumble.",

      "bodyText": "Mathematical possibility may suggest otherwise, but this was surely the day Liverpool's already slender hopes of Champions League qualification finally turned to dust. Up against a Sunderland side weakened by the suspension of two key players, St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon and Lee Cattermole, Kenny Dalglish's team tested the home goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, with one shot on target. Considering the array of expensive talent on view for the visitors, indictments do not come much more damning. \"I don't think it was much of a game,\" said a downbeat Dalglish. \"I don't think there was much in it.\" Asked if his side's position, 10 points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, meant the top four was no longer a realistic target, Liverpool's manager demurred. \"I'll say what I said in August,\" he said. \"At the end of the season we'll count our points and see where we are.\" They will not accrue as many as expected if too many more 90 minutes contain as many missed connections and concession of possession as this one. When it came to the latter, Charlie Adam was the biggest culprit. Not content with showing his ponderous side, the Liverpool midfielder also gave away a series of needless fouls, eight before the interval. If Adam represented one weak link in Dalglish's armoury, Sebastian Coates looked like another, the centre-half displaying his inexperience against Nicklas Bendtner. But while the Dane \u2013 who scored Sunderland's winner before later being taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury that threatens his participation in next Saturday's FA Cup sixth round tie at Everton \u2013 delighted in stealing in behind Coates on the blindside, such manoeuvres invariably ended with no one around to latch on to the resultant cross or lay off. If Bendtner, like his Sunderland team-mate James McClean, were two of the few to impress on a badly cutting up pitch, Craig Bellamy was arguably the best individual \u2013 albeit one betrayed by less inventive colleagues. Time after time Bellamy got beyond Phil Bardsley only to find Luis Su\u00e1rez and company unequal to his deliveries. With Su\u00e1rez struggling in the face of the highly efficient defensive barrier provided by John O'Shea and Michael Turner, the puzzle was why Dalglish did not swiftly introduce Andy Carroll in a bid to ruffle O'Shea, especially. With Sess\u00e8gnon sidelined, Bendtner and Fraizer Campbell formed Martin O'Neill's new-look attacking partnership and, in the 57th minute, they answered lingering questions about their compatibility. First Campbell did well to resist the attentions of Martin Skrtel before unleashing a shot from 20 yards out that rebounded up off both the base of a post and Pepe Reina. Before Reina could rally, Bendtner had half-volleyed the ball beyond him from close range. Adam subsequently shot wide after a cross by Jordan Henderson, who, despite much typically energetic endeavour, would surely have hoped to have made more of an impact against his old club. It was Adam, though, who rightly made way when Dalglish finally liberated Carroll, along with fit-again Steven Gerrard, from the bench. That Bellamy \u2013 who looked far from happy at seeing his number flash up on the electronic board \u2013 was the other Liverpool player withdrawn presumably had more to do with his troublesome knees than the threat he posed Sunderland. O'Neill responded to Dalglish's little reshuffle by replacing Campbell with David Vaughan and switching to a five-man midfield. By succeeding in starving Carroll of service, this switch highlighted Liverpool's lack of a proper cross-supplying winger. When Henderson eventually made way for precisely such a player, Stewart Downing, it was too late. Indeed, an enduring Merseyside mystery is why Carroll and Downing are so rarely on the pitch together. The sole blemish on Sunderland's afternoon was Bendtner's injury, sustained after a challenge that resulted in Skrtel being booked. With the break in play suiting O'Neill's team, it initially seemed the Arsenal loanee might be indulging in a little time-wasting, but he was carried off with his leg in a brace and, afterwards, Sunderland's manager expressed concern. \"Nicklas is a worry for next weekend,\" said O'Neill. \"He's twisted his knee and we're not certain about it. It's pretty sore and there's a bit of swelling. We won't know anything for 48 hours.\" With Bendtner having hit decent form over the past couple of weeks, Everton will be hoping the prognosis is disappointing.",

      "bodyText": "The sheep in Wolves' clothing lost again, in Terry Connor's first home game as manager, deservedly defeated by two goals from the impressive Junior Hoilett, who has hauled Blackburn out of the bottom three. Sinking fast under Connor's trainee management, Wolves have now been beaten in each of their last five matches at Molineux, and have won only one of their past 14 in the Premier League. Next Sunday they play Manchester United. Their predicament brought an angry protest from supporters after the match, who gathered outside the stadium calling for the resignation of the club's owner, Steve Morgan, who sacked Mick McCarthy four weeks ago without having a suitable replacement to hand. In contrast, Blackburn and their band of travelling followers were in celebratory mood after their first away win and first clean sheet of the season. Steve Kean, their manager, said: \"With 15 points from our last 10 games, I think we are hitting form at the right time. Junior Hoilett will get all the headlines, and he is a special player, but it was the energy and commitment of the others that gave us the platform for the clean sheet.\" The impression of disarray at Molineux was fuelled last Monday, when Roger Johnson, the captain, was sent home after reporting for training allegedly smelling of alcohol. Presumably he had been drinking to forget. Discussed as an England candidate a year ago, the rangy centre-half had found himself unable to get in a woeful team thrashed 5-0 by Fulham. He was welcomed back into the fold on Saturday after apologising in midweek, but got no further than the bench. The two sides went at it hammer and tongs, with composure and accuracy sacrificed in the cause of lung-bursting effort. Foot on the ball? Foot through it was the order of the day. This was what it was: a relegation scrap, with finesse neither expected nor forthcoming. Hoilett, a gifted touch player, merits a more salubrious stage than Rovers are capable of providing, and his contract is up at the end of the season. Top clubs are known to be interested, but Kean hopes he will stay. \"We are hopeful of getting the points tally we need to stay up, and if we do that we can go back to him and try to sign him on again.\" Yakubu Ayegbeni had threatened twice before Hoilett broke the stalemate, after 43 minutes, when Morten Gamst Pedersen's long throw-in reached him via an unfortunate touch by David Davis at the near post. The finish, from near the penalty spot, was high class, but one had to sympathise with young Davis, who had been recalled from his loan spell with Chesterfield to make his Premier League debut, only to set up the all-important first goal for the opposition. Stephen Fletcher ought to have equalised at the start of the second half from a Matt Jarvis cross, but the striker shot weakly at Paul Robinson from a similar position to that from which Hoilett had scored. That was the way of it for the most part, thud and blunder, and the home crowd became increasingly disgruntled. The Blackburn fans, as is their habit, chanted the name of their late benefactor, Jack Walker, rather than saluting Kean, which is beginning to seem a mite unfair. Hoilett, supplied by Yakubu, settled the issue midway through the second half when he was allowed the time in which to set his sights 25 yards out before directing a left-footed shot inside Wayne Hennesey's left-hand post. A crestfallen Connor said: \"We spoke after the game and we all still believe. If there's a protest outside, it's against all of us. We're all in this together.\"",

      "bodyText": "Preamble Hello. There are four 3pm games in the best league in England today. Wolves and Blackburn meet in a relegation three-pointer; Chelsea begin their 2011-12 Premier League campaign against Stoke, just as they did back in August; Fulham go to Aston Villa with actual hope of a second consecutive away win; and Sunderland can jump to within two points of Liverpool by beating them at the Stadium of Light. These are the fixtures, with predictions on which you are strongly advised not to wager your last Mintola. Aston Villa 1-1 Fulham Chelsea 3-0 Stoke Sunderland 2-1 Liverpool Wolves 2-2 Blackburn In the other relegation three-pointer, Bolton are drawing 1-1 with QPR. There has also been a Roy Carroll goal. You can follow the last 40 minutes with Scott Murray's in-running sequential events special! Statgasm department Stoke are an admirable team, a triumph of the human spirit. They are also a complete disgrace when they play away to the, er, Big Seven. Look at these results since they were promoted in 2008: Man Utd (A): 0-5, 0-4, 1-2, 0-2 Man City (A): 0-3, 0-2, 0-3, 0-3 Tottenham (A): 1-3, 1-0, 2-3 Arsenal (A): 1-4, 0-2, 0-1, 1-3 Chelsea (A): 1-2, 0-7, 0-2 Liverpool (A): 0-0, 0-4, 0-2, 0-0 So the overall record is P22 W1 D2 L19 F8 A57 Pts 5. If Chelsea can't win today, they really are in trouble. Chelsea v Stoke team news John Terry is fit. I mean that, I should stress, in the classical sense of the word. Chelsea (4-D-2): Cech; Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Cole; Mikel; Ramires, Meireles; Lampard; Kalou, Drogba. Subs: Turnbull, Luiz, Essien, Romeu, Torres, Mata, Sturridge. Stoke (4-4-2): Begovic; Wilkinson, Shawcross, Huth, Wilson; Shotton, Whitehead, Diao, Walters; Fuller, Jones. Subs: Sorensen, Pennant, Upson, Delap, Crouch, Jerome, Palacios. Referee: Andre Marriner (W Midlands) Sunderland v Liverpool team news Former footballer Wayne Bridge makes his full debut for Sunderland. Sunderland (4-4-2): Mignolet; Bardsley, O'Shea, Turner, Bridge; Larsson, Colback, Gardner, McClean; Bendtner, Campbell. Subs: Gordon, Wickham, Kilgallon, Vaughan, Meyler, Kyrgiakos, Elmohamady. Liverpool (4-3-3): Reina; Kelly, Skrtel, Coates, Jose Enrique; Henderson, Adam, Spearing; Kuyt, Suarez, Bellamy. Subs: Doni, Gerrard, Carroll, Maxi, Downing, Carragher, Flanagan.

Subs: Guzan, Heskey, Bannan, Weimann, Lichaj, Baker, Gardner. Fulham (4-4-2): Schwarzer; Kelly, Senderos, Hangeland, John Arne Riise; Duff, Dembele, Murphy, Dempsey; Pogrebnyak, Johnson. Subs: Stockdale, Baird, Orlando Sa, Hughes, Diarra, Etuhu, Davies. Referee: Jon Moss (W Yorkshire) Wolverhampton v Blackburn team news Wolverhampton (4-5-1): Hennessey; Zubar, Stearman, Bassong, Ward; Doyle, Davis, Edwards, O'Hara, Jarvis; Fletcher. Subs: De Vries, Kightly, Ebanks-Blake, Johnson, Berra, Milijas, Foley. Blackburn (4-2-3-1): Robinson; Lowe, Dann, Hanley, Martin Olsson; Nzonzi, Pedersen; Formica, Hoilett, Marcus Olsson; Yakubu. Subs: Bunn, Givet, Dunn, Modeste, Petrovic, Goodwillie, Vukcevic. Referee: Chris Foy (Merseyside) 2.38pm It has finished Bolton 2-1 QPR, and Leslie Hughes has got the face on after a series of decisions went against QPR. Joey Barton has got the face on, too; not even Nietzsche can explain this one. QPR have a really tough run-in and \u2013 in complete contradiction of what I wrote this time last week, before I realised how tough their run-in was \u2013 will do extremely well to avoid relegation. In fact, forget that. They're down. 2.47pm \"Apropos of not a lot*, one thing I don't get about English footballing mentality is what seems to be a pronounced distaste for Cesc Fabregas,\" says Phil Podolsky. \"He seems to be widely perceived as some smug, pampered Catalan poodle, while to me he seems an intelligent, sensitive and humble young man, full of respect for his mentors and teammates. *though Guardian did publish that interview with him yesterday.\" He's a beautiful player, but he has always seemed a bit of a phony. This hardly makes him stand out in the world of modern football, of course. Let's talk about something nicer. Like great team goals. Check out these toasters. Southampton. Deportivo Toluca. Brazil. Wales. Manchester United. Any more? 2.54pm \"Why is the referee's name given along with the team news?\" says Paul Taylor. \"It really doesn't matter up front, does it? If you consider the time and effort it takes typing that into various Guardian computers, and the energy needed for us all to read and comprehend same, aren't we needlessly increasing the rate of entropy of the universe?\" I have never understood why we have to know where the referee lives. Every time my train goes past or stops at Tring I think of Graham Poll, and that's not good for anybody. I suppose naming the town/city at least gives the inevitable witch-hunt a certain focus. 2.56pm \"You got married yet?\" says Nicholas. \"Doesn't look like it, you'd be home cleaning house.\" Are you offering? \"Moving on, you did a piece on it, I believe, and you were right, Brazil '86 was a fantastic team with Careca's movement around the box a thing of beauty. My word, just watched the Careca goal again. It was Kasparov like in it's execution, fits, pauses, acceleration and desperate one-twos all pre-planned to free Careca in the proverbial acres of space. Beautiful!\" Yep, here's the Joy of Six: team goals from which most of the earlier links were nicked. 2.57pm \"Always loved the South Coast Spurs,\" says Tim Cleminson of that Mick Channon goal. \"Remember watching Cantona in his upturned collar strut his stuff at the Dell \u2013 a ground so close to the players you could smell the beer on their breath from the night before and feel the heat from Keane's stare on your cockles and mayonnaise sandwich.\" Good job it was mayonnaise. 3pm PEEP PEEP. Let's get this over with, shall we? 3.04pm Chelsea have started strongly against Stoke, with Ivanovic missing a great headed chance. Are there any Stoke fans who know why they roll over so often in these games? 3.07pm \"I don't have the link but perhaps you could dig out Argentina's goal from Germany in 2006 that went through almost every member of the side before Cambiasso finished it off,\" says David Wall. \"Despite the Argentinians running a competition amongst themselves that was probably best goal of the tournament.\" I thought that goal was a touch overrated, if only because the defending was pathetic. 3.10pm Gary Cahill Beckenbauers forward and drives an excellent shot towards the far corner that is pushed wide by Asmir Begovic. Chelsea are all over Stoke; it's like watching a Chelsea game from 2006. 3.11pm \"Some Barcelona team goals usually absent from compilations,\" begins Phil Podolsky. \"This, from the Intercontinental Cup in 2006, is my favourite. And this, from this season. This is again from the Rijkaard era, but with Iniesta already dominant, starting and finishing a gorgeous move by Deco and Messi.\" 3.14pm Sunderland have been all over Liverpool, according to Charlie Nicholas on Sky. It's weird to think that Liverpool were so close to the title only three years ago; now they are as far away as they have been since the Souness era. 3.15pm \"On the same day \u2013 the same day mind \u2013 that Leo Messi scored five goals in the Champions League, our national network CBC introduced a clip of Beckham with the line, 'the best soccer player in the world',\" says Hubert O'Hearn, a big fan of Canadian sports coverage. 3.16pm Ramires misses a headed chance at Stamford Bridge. A Chelsea goal is not just in the post; it's been sent by recorded delivery. 3.18pm \"Stoke roll over because Pulis has clearly decided that there are teams he won't beat and therefore doesn't even try,\" says Tom Barneby. \"What have Stoke got to play for anyway? They got into Europe and had a game against Valencia at the Mestalla and he left half the squad at home! Devoid of ambition and happy with somewhere between 8th and 13th. Sad times.\" In Pulis's defence, he did give Europe a really good go this season. It was only when they lost the first leg that he left players out, calculating that they probably couldn't win 2-0 over there. Sir Alex Ferguson should do the same on Thursday. Still, it's sadly true that, in modern football, 17th and fourth place are the new trophies. Who needs glory? 3.20pm These are the latest scores on another Premier League rip-roarer Aston Villa 0-0 Fulham Chelsea 0-0 Stoke Sunderland 0-0 Liverpool Wolves 0-0 Blackburn 3.24pm \"Liverpool are playing pish,\" says Phil Sawyer, mis-spelling 'badly'. \"They look like they've completely given up on getting any higher in the league and have staked all their money on next Sunday's match with Stoke (looking at your analysis of Stoke's stats, possibly not without good reason). Interesting to see Coates in ahead of Carragher. A move to the coaching staff can't be far off for the latter.\" 3.25pm What if this is as good as it gets? 3.26pm \"See if this fries your onions,\" says Mike Gibbons. \"The length of the pitch, six players involved and a defence splitting pass across the face of their own penalty area; I give you Denmark.\" 3.26pm: RED CARD Stoke's Ricardo Fuller has been sent off for stamping on the thigh of Branislav Ivanovic, a preposterous and vaguely amusing reaction to a perfectly fair challenge. There goes Stoke's 0.00000001 per cent chance of getting a point. 3.28pm That Fuller red card wasn't as funny as this or this, two of the more amusing acts of on-field violence. 3.30pm \"Hubert O'Hearn (3:15pm) is telling porkies to get his name up in lights and, perhaps, a hearty chuckle,\" says, er, Roseway Media. \"CBC said nothing of the sort. They intimated, barely, that he's the most popular, though. For the record, they were previewing the Toronto/LA game.\" 3.33pm: GOALS GOALS GOALS These are the latest scores ion the Premier League. Aston Villa 0-0 Fulham Chelsea 0-0 Stoke Sunderland 0-0 Liverpool Wolves 0-0 Blackburn 3.34pm \"Not true,\" says Hubert O'Hearn. \"It was the morning newscast after the game in Toronto, Roseway Media at approximately 6:15 AM. So there \u2013 nyahhh!\" Right, let's leave it there. I don't have the will. 3.37pm \"This gem by Holland against Italy in Euro 2008 has been burned in my memory for the past 3+ years,\" says Jim Rogers. \"Beautiful counter from a defensive clearance of an Italy corner. P.S. Sorry about the quality, but I wanted a video that showed the whole pitch during GVB's run.\" 3.38pm Now this is what I'm talking about. \"My personal favourite act of on-field violence,\" says Andrew Parrington, \"is Gary Bennett on David Speedie.\" The best bit about that is that, after putting in an awful coward's challenge, Speedie poses like a man who has earned some kind of moral victory \u2013 unaware that, just outside his peripheral vision, a hand is homing in on his throat... 3.40pm When was the last time there were no goals at half-time in the 3pm Premier League fixtures? 3.42pm Ivanovic has just hit the woodwork for Chelsea, ramming a half-cleared cross off the bar from eight yards. Di Matteo has already made a substitution, bringing on Mata for Meireles. Very Jose. 3.43pm A bizarre first-half score in League One: Charlton 0-4 (FOUR) Notts County. 3.44pm: Wolves 0-1 Blackburn (Hoilett 43) A classy volley from the excellent Junior Hoilett has given Blackburn the lead at Molineux. At the moment, they look the most likely survivors among the bottom five. Kean out! 3.45pm This is the league table as things stand, with Blackburn hitting the heights of 16th place. 3.46pm \"Charlie Adam has replaced that little girl 'Newt' from Aliens (1986) as the most annoying person I've ever watched on a moving picture screen,\" says Owen Cameron. \"The way her childish innocence led to just about every likable Marine on the alien planet eventually being killed, is rather similar to the way Adam butchers every single Liverpool attacking move. There's an honours thesis in this I feel.\" 3.47pm Tim Hazell points out that it was Meireles, not Mikel, who was substituted at Stamford Bridge. I've now amended the earlier entry so that anybody reading this clockwatch after the event will not know I cocked up in the first place. Oh. 3.49pm The half-time scores: Aston Villa 0-0 Fulham Chelsea 0-0 Stoke Sunderland 0-0 Liverpool Wolves 0-1 Blackburn 3.51pm \"The most amusing act of on-field violence?\" says Rich Harland. \"Step forward, Andre Bikey. (Warning- contains Garth Crooks commentary.)\" 3.52pm This, from Tim Cleminson, had the square root of diddly squat to do with team goals or on-field violence. But it is fairly amusing. 3.57pm \"Aside from the annoying quality of his play, another good thesis subject would be to work out why every commentator use the endearing 'Charlie Adam' every time he touches the ball?\" says Paul McCormick. \"'Gerrard...Kuyt... CHARLIE Adam???' Does everyone owe him a pint or something?\" 3.58pm \"The victim of an on-field four-way scythe from Brentford defenders, Leyton Orient's Kenny Achampong still gets sent off for the pleasure of it,\" writes my colleague James Dart. \"David Elleray in the middle.\" That's hilarious! So, to summarise, he's sent off for being assaulted twice? It's up there with Rudi Voller getting a yellow card for each mouthful of spit in his hair. 3.59pm Here's another nawty tackle. You have to admire the fact he shapes to play on as if nothing has happened. 4.02pm \"Are you looking for some on-field violence with a sprinkling of malice?\" says Stuart Lilly. \"Welcome Francesco Totti.\" A sprinkling? 4.06pm Everyone remembers Massing, of course, but look at this tackle earlier in the same game. 4.09pm \"Imagine MOTD tonight if the scores stay as they are!\" says Anthony O'Connell. That's alright, they can fill some time by getting Rick Witter to interview Rory Delap. 4.11pm \"Here's something to add to your comment about QPR's problems for the run-in,\" says Brian Cox. \"As a pretty crude way to look at how hard the remaining fixtures are, if you take the average league position for every opponent team to be played in the remaining 11 games, the numbers range from 7.8 (QPR) to 13.1 (Man Utd). Low number means you are playing the higher positioned teams. Wigan have a pretty rough run as well.\" 4.12pm Fulham are having an excellent spell as Aston Villa, with Clint Dempsey fresh-airing a decent chance. 4.13pm \"I think Steve Kean has ridden out a storm not of his making and is really rather impressive,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Is this wrong?\" I like him too. Even earlier in the season they were playing some good football, and he has behaved with a dignity that most of us would struggle to replicate. 4.14pm These are the latest scores. I don't know what else to say. Aston Villa 0-0 Fulham Chelsea 0-0 Stoke Sunderland 0-0 Liverpool Wolves 0-1 Blackburn 4.15pm Ten-man Stoke are defending fairly comfortably at Stamford Bridge, according to Paul Merson on Sky. AVB out! RDM out! 4.16pm: Sunderland 1-0 Liverpool (Bendtner 56) Frazier Campbell's low 20-yard shot hits the post before rebounding off the back of Pepe Reina, and Nicklas Bendtner taps the loose ball in from a few yards. 4.17pm Pepe Reina hasn't had much luck at Sunderland \u2013 that was also where he conceded the beach-ball goal two seasons ago. 4.18pm \"This one is worth it just for the last line of the commentary,\" says Ed Rostron. 4.19pm Charlton have pulled it back to 4-2 against Notts County at the Valley. 4.20pm This violence is more jaw-dropping than amusing, but it's worth seeing: Real Madrid's Juanito on Lothar Matthaus. He was sent off, left the field in tears and was then banned for five years. 4.21pm If Liverpool lose today they will arguably drop into the third division of the Premier League. The odd thing about Liverpool this season is that they have generally played really well against the sides above them. 4.25pm \"Can anyone think of a joke that ends with: '... I'll get me Coates'?\" says Richard Yates. \"I would quite like to use it at dinner parties. Thanks.\" You do realise this is Sebastian Coates, not Ralph, and that the pronunciation is slightly different? 4.26pm: Wolves 0-2 Blackburn (Hoilett 69) Junior Hoilett scores another fine goal, thrashing home from 25 yards. This is turning into a really good day's work for Blackburn, who are going to jump from 18th to 16th \u2013 their highest position since mid-September. 4.27pm Begovic makes a wonderful save with his 'wrong' hand from Didier Drogba's free-kick. It's all Chelsea now. 4.28pm: Chelsea 1-0 Stoke (Drogba 68) A fine goal from Didier Drogba gives Chelsea the lead. He received Mata's splendid reverse through pass and, despite having very little space to work with, rounded Begovic to score. That was such an accomplished finish. 4.30pm \"That Juanito stomping jump is bad,\" says Dennis Johns, \"but this is staggeringly horrendous. Imagine if he'd connected with his head. Lucky it was Pepe aiming for it.\" 4.31pm Andy Carroll and Steven Gerrard are on for Liverpool. \"Over the past few weeks Liverpool seem to have decided to stop trying so that they'll miss out on fifth place and won't have to play in the Europa League next season,\" says David Wall. \"Haven't they realised that they've already qualified with that Milk Cup win? The only chance they have of getting out of it is by making the top four so they really should put in a bit more effort, unless the plan is to follow Rangers' lead, go bust by the end of the month and fail to meet the financial requirements for European competition.\" 4.33pm \"Coates should've been covering Bendtner rather than gawking,\" says Sam Katterfield. \"Have any South American defenders done well in the Premiership?\" Not many. Alex was good, as was Horacio Carbonari, and as is Fabricio Coloccini. But for every Alex there has been at least two Roque Juniors. 4.34pm These are the latest Premier League scores: Aston Villa 0-0 Fulham Chelsea 1-0 Stoke Sunderland 1-0 Liverpool Wolves 0-2 Blackburn 4.36pm Four goals. Four goals in 156 minutes' clockwatching. A goal every 39 minutes. I'm sorry, for all of it. 4.41pm \"Not quite what you were asking at 3.40pm,\" says Andrew Clark of the excellent Premier Soccer Stats, \"but according to my records, back in the day when more games were played on same day, seven of 11 games on 4th April 1994 were goalless at half time. Then, on 29th April 1995, seven of nine were goalless at half-time.\" Thank goodness we didn't have clockwatches and internet back then. 4.42pm Nenad Milijas misses a fantastic chance to get Wolves back in the game at home to Blackburn. At Stamford Bridge, Cameron Jerome runs at the last man Gary Cahill and shoots wide from 20 yards. 4.43pm \"Gabriel Heinze was excellent for United before he did his ACL,\" says Jesse Galdston. \"He was never really the same afterwards, albeit he was still above average.\" 4.46pm \"That mention of Horacio Carbonari came right out of leftfield, but nice to know you appreciate him,\" says Charles Robinson. \"When he joined Derby he came with the nickname of 'The Bazooka,' apparently on account of his uncommonly powerful shot, and so obviously we were all looking forward to seeing him hit a free kick. Unfortunately, someone mistranslated the name, and he's actually known in his native Argentina as 'The Dwarf'. Deary me.\" 4.47pm A 30-yard free-kick from Juan Mata thumps off the outside of the right post. 4.48pm \"The great thing about Pepe's descent that isn't shown in the previous clip but is in this one is that much like Juanito, Pepe leans over his stricken foe to whisper murder into his ear,\" says James. \"After he is dragged away by some mediators he ends up chinning one of them and the player who gets lamped only gets it because the guy Pepe wanted to thump had moved out of reach.\" 4.49pm Aston Villa at home to Fulham. With hindsight, that was never going to do much to the hairs on the back of the neck, was it. 4.50pm It has finished Wolves 0-2 Blackburn, and by all accounts it was a thoroughly deserved victory. The excellent Junior Hoilett scored two superb goals \u2013 and Blackburn finally kept their first clean sheet in the league this season. Blackburn are staying up, aren't they? 4.51pm: Aston Villa 1-0 Fulham (Weimann 90) Told you there would be drama at Villa Park. The young Austrian Andreas Weimann has scored at the second attempt to give Villa victory, and almost certainly ensure they will not be dragged into the relegation battle. 4.52pm It has finished Aston Villa 1-0 Fulham. It's Villa's first home win in the league since November 5. And Sunderland 1-0 Liverpool is also a final score. Only two points separate those sides now. 4.55pm It's all over at Stamford Bridge as well, so that's it for the day. They'll be talking about this clockwatch for years. I have to dash off to do work for the paper, so I'll leave you with the final scores. Night. Aston Villa 1-0 Fulham Chelsea 1-0 Stoke Sunderland 1-0 Liverpool Wolves 0-2 Blackburn",

Wolves and Blackburn meet in a relegation three-pointer; Chelsea begin their 2011-12 Premier League campaign against Stoke, just as they did back in August; Fulham go to Aston Villa with actual hope of a second consecutive away win; and Sunderland can jump to within two points of Liverpool by beating them at the Stadium of Light.</p> <p>These are the fixtures, with predictions on which you are strongly advised not to wager your last Mintola.</p> <blockquote> <p>Aston Villa 1-1 Fulham<br>Chelsea 3-0 Stoke<br>Sunderland 2-1 Liverpool<br>Wolves 2-2 Blackburn</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>In the other relegation three-pointer</strong>, Bolton are drawing 1-1 with QPR. There has also been a Roy Carroll goal. You can follow the last 40 minutes with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/10/bolton-qpr-premier-league-mbm\">Scott Murray's in-running sequential events special</a>!</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Statgasm department</strong> Stoke are an admirable team, a triumph of the human spirit. They are also a complete disgrace when they play away to the, er, Big Seven. Look at these results since they were promoted in 2008:</p> <blockquote> <p>Man Utd (A): 0-5, 0-4, 1-2, 0-2<br>Man City (A): 0-3, 0-2, 0-3, 0-3<br>Tottenham (A): 1-3, 1-0, 2-3<br>Arsenal (A): 1-4, 0-2, 0-1, 1-3<br>Chelsea (A): 1-2, 0-7, 0-2<br>Liverpool (A): 0-0, 0-4, 0-2, 0-0</p> </blockquote> <p>So the overall record is <em>P22 W1 D2 L19 F8 A57 Pts 5</em>.

Joey Barton has got the face on, too; not even Nietzsche can explain this one. QPR have a really tough run-in and \u2013 in complete contradiction of what I wrote this time last week, before I realised how tough their run-in was \u2013 will do extremely well to avoid relegation. In fact, forget that. They're down.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.47pm</strong> \"Apropos of not a lot*, one thing I don't get about English footballing mentality is what seems to be a pronounced distaste for Cesc Fabregas,\" says Phil Podolsky. \"He seems to be widely perceived as some smug, pampered Catalan poodle, while to me he seems an intelligent, sensitive and humble young man, full of respect for his mentors and teammates. </p> <p>*<em>though Guardian did publish that interview with him yesterday</em>.\"</p> <p>He's a beautiful player, but he has always seemed a bit of a phony.

If you consider the time and effort it takes typing that into various Guardian computers, and the energy needed for us all to read and comprehend same, aren't we needlessly increasing the rate of entropy of the universe?\" I have never understood why we have to know where the referee lives. Every time my train goes past or stops at Tring I think of Graham Poll, and that's not good for anybody. I suppose naming the town/city at least gives the inevitable witch-hunt a certain focus.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.56pm</strong> \"You got married yet?\" says Nicholas. \"Doesn't look like it, you'd be home cleaning house.\" Are you offering? \"Moving on, you did a piece on it, I believe, and you were right, Brazil '86 was a fantastic team with Careca's movement around the box a thing of beauty. My word, just watched the Careca goal again. It was Kasparov like in it's execution, fits, pauses, acceleration and desperate one-twos all pre-planned to free Careca in the proverbial acres of space. Beautiful!\"</p> <p>Yep, here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/jul/17/joy-of-six-great-team-goals\">the Joy of Six: team goals</a> from which most of the earlier links were nicked.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.57pm</strong> \"Always loved the South Coast Spurs,\" says Tim Cleminson of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VSOpeYqgSI\">that Mick Channon goal</a>. \"Remember watching Cantona in his upturned collar strut his stuff at the Dell \u2013 a ground so close to the players you could smell the beer on their breath from the night before and feel the heat from Keane's stare on your cockles and mayonnaise sandwich.\" Good job it was mayonnaise.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3pm</strong> PEEP PEEP. Let's get this over with, shall we?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.04pm</strong> Chelsea have started strongly against Stoke, with Ivanovic missing a great headed chance. Are there any Stoke fans who know why they roll over so often in these games?</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.07pm</strong> \"I don't have the link but perhaps you could dig out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQUDJiNDEeE\">Argentina's goal from Germany in 2006</a> that went through almost every member of the side before Cambiasso finished it off,\" says David Wall. \"Despite the Argentinians running a competition amongst themselves that was probably best goal of the tournament.\" I thought that goal was a touch overrated, if only because the defending was pathetic.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.10pm</strong> Gary Cahill Beckenbauers forward and drives an excellent shot towards the far corner that is pushed wide by Asmir Begovic. Chelsea are all over Stoke; it's like watching a Chelsea game from 2006.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.11pm</strong> \"Some Barcelona team goals usually absent from compilations,\" begins Phil Podolsky. \"This, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gm8PFK5rO0#t=2m0s\">from the Intercontinental Cup in 2006</a>, is my favourite.

It's weird to think that Liverpool were so close to the title only three years ago; now they are as far away as they have been since the Souness era.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong> \"On the same day \u2013 <em>the same day</em> mind \u2013 that Leo Messi scored five goals in the Champions League, our national network CBC introduced a clip of Beckham with the line, 'the best soccer player in the world',\" says Hubert O'Hearn, a big fan of Canadian sports coverage.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.16pm</strong> Ramires misses a headed chance at Stamford Bridge. A Chelsea goal is not just in the post; it's been sent by recorded delivery.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.18pm</strong> \"Stoke roll over because Pulis has clearly decided that there are teams he won't beat and therefore doesn't even try,\" says Tom Barneby. \"What have Stoke got to play for anyway? They got into Europe and had a game against Valencia at the Mestalla and he left half the squad at home! Devoid of ambition and happy with somewhere between 8th and 13th. Sad times.\"</p> <p>In Pulis's defence, he did give Europe a really good go this season. It was only when they lost the first leg that he left players out, calculating that they probably couldn't win 2-0 over there. Sir Alex Ferguson should do the same on Thursday. Still, it's sadly true that, in modern football, 17th and fourth place are the new trophies. Who needs glory?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong> These are the latest scores on another Premier League rip-roarer</p> <blockquote> <p>Aston Villa 0-0 Fulham<br>Chelsea 0-0 Stoke<br>Sunderland 0-0 Liverpool<br>Wolves 0-0 Blackburn</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.24pm</strong> \"Liverpool are playing pish,\" says Phil Sawyer, mis-spelling 'badly'. \"They look like they've completely given up on getting any higher in the league and have staked all their money on next Sunday's match with Stoke (looking at your analysis of Stoke's stats, possibly not without good reason). Interesting to see Coates in ahead of Carragher. A move to the coaching staff can't be far off for the latter.\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.25pm</strong> What if this is as good as it gets?</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.26pm</strong> \"See if this fries your onions,\" says Mike Gibbons. \"The length of the pitch, six players involved and a defence splitting pass across the face of their own penalty area; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nbxdaHRwMPA#t=188s\">I give you Denmark</a>.\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.26pm: RED CARD</strong> Stoke's Ricardo Fuller has been sent off for stamping on the thigh of Branislav Ivanovic, a preposterous and vaguely amusing reaction to a perfectly fair challenge. There goes Stoke's 0.00000001 per cent chance of getting a point.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.28pm</strong> That Fuller red card wasn't as funny as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyj8yonT1Fs#t=10m00s\">this</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygVgxYa3mlo\">this</a>, two of the more amusing acts of on-field violence.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong> \"Hubert O'Hearn (3:15pm) is telling porkies to get his name up in lights and, perhaps, a hearty chuckle,\" says, er, Roseway Media. \"CBC said nothing of the sort. They intimated, barely, that he's the most popular, though.

So there \u2013 nyahhh!\" Right, let's leave it there. I don't have the will.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.37pm</strong> \"This gem by Holland against Italy in Euro 2008 has been burned in my memory for the past 3+ years,\" says Jim Rogers. \"<a href=\"http://vodpod.com/watch/795330-netherlands-2-0-italy-euro-2008\">Beautiful counter from a defensive clearance</a> of an Italy corner. P.S. Sorry about the quality, but I wanted a video that showed the whole pitch during GVB's run.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3.38pm</strong> Now <em>this</em> is what I'm talking about. \"My personal favourite act of on-field violence,\" says Andrew Parrington, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU8Lwixj6mk\">is Gary Bennett on David Speedie</a>.\" The best bit about that is that, after putting in an awful coward's challenge, Speedie poses like a man who has earned some kind of moral victory \u2013 unaware that, just outside his peripheral vision, a hand is homing in on his throat...</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3.40pm</strong> When was the last time there were no goals at half-time in the 3pm Premier League fixtures?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3.42pm</strong> Ivanovic has just hit the woodwork for Chelsea, ramming a half-cleared cross off the bar from eight yards. Di Matteo has already made a substitution, bringing on Mata for Meireles. <em>Very</em> Jose.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>3.43pm</strong> A bizarre first-half score in League One: Charlton 0-4 (FOUR) Notts County.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>3.44pm: Wolves 0-1 Blackburn (Hoilett 43)</strong> A classy volley from the excellent Junior Hoilett has given Blackburn the lead at Molineux. At the moment, they look the most likely survivors among the bottom five.

James Jeffery, 27, stole around 10,000 database records containing the personal details of women who had registered with the site before \"boasting\" of his crime on Twitter. Westminster magistrates court, London, heard that the hacker had also identified \"vulnerabilities\" on a string of websites including those for the FBI, the CIA and the Houses of Parliament. Jeffery, of Castle Street, Wednesbury, West Midlands, showed no emotion as he appeared in the dock this morning to admit two offences under the Computer Misuse Act. The court was told that Jeffery, who was arrested in a police swoop on his home during the early hours of Friday, intended to \"release all the details\" of those registered on the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) site. But he had a change of heart because he thought doing so would be \"wrong\", the court was told. Earlier he had taken to Twitter, under the name Pablo Escobar, to prove he had accessed hundreds of usernames and email addresses. This involved him printing the name and logon details of a BPAS administrator. He also managed to deface the BPAS website with the Anonymous logo and a statement. Jeffery later confessed to his crimes during interviews with detectives, telling police two friends had had abortions which he disagreed with, the court heard. Officers who traced the BPAS breach to Jeffery's home found his computer \"in the process of being wiped clean\". They seized a number of items including an iPad, iPhone, three laptops, a hard drive and a notebook. The court was told that police were investigating further alleged hacking by Jeffery, involving websites for the FBI, CIA, West Midlands police, the Houses of Parliament, the US navy, Arizona police and Spanish police. Deputy Senior District Judge Daphne Wickham described Jeffery as a \"zealot with an anti-abortion campaign\". She adjourned the case, telling the court she did not have \"sufficient\" powers to pass sentence. Refusing an application for bail, she added: \"Many, many other organisations and people's private details would be at risk. You clearly are an able hacker. You will be remanded in custody.\" He will be sentenced at Southwark crown court at a later date.",

      "bodyText": "Wales took another small, pragmatic step towards a third grand slam in eight years, their head coach, Warren Gatland, getting the patience he had demanded from his players, even if they overdid things at times. It took 49 minutes of robust Italian defence and plenty of Welsh handling errors before the first try, and that came from an Italian fumble and counterattack \u2013 Jamie Roberts throwing off his poor form against England to gallop home from 50 metres \u2013 and 77 minutes before the second, wing Alex Cuthbert capping a fine game . However, it was far from the mauling that had been expected against a side that will contest yet another wooden spoon. Then again, Wales will be pleased with the bonus side of the ledger; Justin Tipuric, deputising for Sam Warburton, showed they have increasing depth in the back row, while scrum-half Rhys Webb picked up his first cap and 10 minutes of experience. They also appear to have played their replacements cards with a fine art, avoiding any serious injury ahead of France visiting the Millennium Stadium for the final round of the Six Nations championship next Saturday. With their captain, Sergio Parisse, suggesting an Italian win in Cardiff \u2013 something never previously achieved \u2013 was a \"mission impossible\" and their coach, Jacques Brunel, describing Wales as \"the strongest team in the tournament\", it may have seemed surprising that the Italians bothered to turn up at all, especially after the way they finished in Dublin. The bookies even made Wales 1-33 favourites and the start was pretty torrid, even if the scoreboard separated the sides by three points after the first quarter of the match and six at the halfway stage. George North announced himself by bouncing through three tackles, followed closely by Cuthbert, who brushed aside two blue shirts. Rhys Priestland rained balls down on both the Italian wings plus the full-back, Andrea Masi, and almost put Cuthbert away with the most precise of cross kicks. Leigh Halfpenny's penalty had been met with one from Mirco Bergamasco, but even if the momentum was building there was nothing decisive. A clever bit of interplay between the centres, Roberts and Jonathan Davies, looked to have prised open the defence, only for Cuthbert to fumble when he switched wings to join the play. The Italian scrum was also showing signs of increasing discomfort \u2013 Adam Jones working on Andrea Lo Cicero \u2013 and, in the 29th minute, Halfpenny, who potted a second penalty from bang in front of the posts after multiple offside infringements, looked to have found a way through the blue wall, only to be pulled down by Parisse (who else?) before Toby Faletau and Roberts combined in the most dangerous moment of the half. Their inter-passing got them to within five metres of the line before the referee, George Clancy, signalled the penalty. Captain Gethin Jenkins took the points and again Italy went into the second half of a Six Nations match still in the game. However, as in Paris and Dublin, that was about as far as it went. Initially the possession was all Italy \u2013 Bergamasco hacking ahead after some slack handling by Alan Wyn Jones \u2013 but, at the inevitable break down, Dan Lydiate pounced on the ball before Halfpenny and Priestland put Roberts in the clear to run away from the covering hooker, Leonardo Ghiraldini. The Lions centre merely had to sidestep Bergamasco and he was in under the posts to make the conversion a simple task for Halfpenny and the lead for Wales 13 points. Unfortunately for the full-back, that was his final contribution to the match before a 10-minute spell in the sin bin after a mid-air clash with the Italian captain. His absence from the pitch, a swathe of replacements and some poor kicking took the sting from Wales's game until Cuthbert took the individual route with three minutes remaining. After conceding 10 tries in their previous three matches, Italy ended the day in half-decent shape ahead of their final game against Scotland.",

      "bodyText": "The mainstream media were transfixed last week by a meme \u2013 an infectious idea. Hard-bitten news editors \u2013 the professionals who pride themselves on knowing what will happen before it happens \u2013 were discomfited to discover that their teenage kids knew something they didn't know. That something was a YouTube video that had been spreading at an astonishing rate. Entitled Kony 2012, it is a 30-minute film made by a campaigning organisation called Invisible Children. Its goal was to raise awareness of the activities of Joseph Kony, a Ugandan warlord who leads the Lord's Resistance Army, in the hope of bringing him to justice. Kony and his LRA are distinguished by their violence and brutality, their weird ideology and \u2013 crucially for the purposes of the video \u2013 their practice of abducting children and turning them into child soldiers. This last practice has led to the bizarre phenomenon of \"night commuting\", in which Ugandan children leave their villages at night in order to sleep in towns, where they are supposedly less vulnerable to kidnapping by Kony and his goons. Invisible Children is a US-based campaigning group, founded in 2004 by film-makers, which has been working in Uganda \u2013 building radio networks, monitoring LRA movements and helping displaced children and families. It has focused on raising awareness of the LRA and on influencing US government policy towards the region. It is believed that its campaigning was at least partly responsible for Barack Obama's decision in 2010 to send 100 military advisers to the Ugandan military to assist in capturing Kony. The YouTube video is a brilliant piece of film-making, in two ways. First, it has a compelling, simple narrative: Kony is a really bad guy and his capture will end suffering for the people of northern Uganda. If US viewers do their bit by influencing their politicians, the world's superpower will take action and Kony will be captured. Second, it conveys this message in a seductive way, with film-maker Jason Williams explaining to his five-year-old son that this Kony is a monster and that dad's job is capturing him. What's not to like? Jason's message was released last Monday. By Thursday it had amassed 26 million views. When I last looked at it on Saturday it was up to 63 million views (with 1,212,109 \"likes\" and only 59,702 \"dislikes\"). So, in the jargon of the day, it's \"gone viral\". In that sense, it represents the most successful manipulation of our new media ecosystem to date because \"virality\" is what every huckster, politician and advertiser now craves \u2013 but very few achieve. Viral dissemination has been a feature of the internet almost from the beginning, but the deliberate exploitation of it dates from Independence Day in the US in 1996, when Hotmail was launched by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith. It was the first \"webmail\" system (allowing people to send and receive email using an internet browser) and its makers had the brilliant idea of appending a footer to every message sent stating that it had been sent by Hotmail and inviting the recipient to \"get a free Hotmail account\" at www.hotmail.com. Viral dissemination received a really powerful boost with the launch of YouTube in 2005. Thereafter, people were able to post striking, amusing or daft videos online and the service made it easy to \"share\" anything that viewers liked. This is what led to the LOLcat explosion and the astonishing viewing totals for charming videos like Charlie Bit My Finger, which has been watched more than 12 million times since it first appeared in 2007. Viral dissemination was also responsible for making Bruno Ganz, the actor who played Adolf Hitler in Downfall, the 2004 film about the last days of Hitler, into the most famous German actor in the world [see footnote] \u2013 though in this case the makers of the film came to regard its online notoriety as a mixed blessing as parodies of one of its climactic scenes started to spread virally across the network. According to YouTube, 60 hours of video material are uploaded to it every minute \u2013 an hour a second. In the midst of such abundance, how can anything get noticed? Attention is now the scarcest commodity in cyberspace \u2013 which explains why virality is so craved by those with things to sell or messages to transmit. In that sense, the most significant thing about the Kony video is that it represents the most successful exploitation of virality to date. But when you delve deeper, it turns out that its success owes something to network theory as well as to storytelling craft. Many years ago, the Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter published a seminal article in the American Journal of Sociology on the special role of \"weak ties\" in networks \u2013 links among people who are not closely bonded \u2013 as being critical for spreading ideas and for helping people join together for action. An examination of the spread of the Kony video suggests that one weak tie in particular may have been critical in launching it to its present eminence. Her name is Oprah Winfrey and she tweeted: \"Have watched the film. Had them on show last year\" on 6 March, after which the graph of YouTube views of the video switches to the trajectory of a bat out of hell. Winfrey, it turns out, has 9.7 million followers on Twitter. The Kony video and the assumptions behind it have been subjected to searching criticism by scholars like Ethan Zuckerman, who have challenged its simplistic analysis of a complex country and its ideological biases \u2013 for example its implicit assumption that Africans are hopeless and that the only solutions to their problems can come from white foreigners. Some have suggested that the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, is no angel either. And there has been a fierce online debate about the ethical dilemmas of viral transmission. \"Kony is like a Rorschach test on to which we inscribe our own simplistically naive ethical calculus,\" wrote one commentator. Others observe that \"sharing\" the video gives people the opportunity of salving their consciences without doing anything serious about the problem of northern Uganda. And so on. The dissemination of the Kony meme does raise interesting questions for the future. It's the most dramatic demonstration so far of how an idea can spread over the globe via a channel that is beyond the reach and control of established media outlets. YouTube can't compete with conventional broadcasting at reaching billions of people instantaneously. But it operates outside the control of conventional gatekeepers and editorial sieves. And a third of the world's population now uses the internet, so the video could, in time, reach an awful lot of people. And what about truth, lies and propaganda? The Kony video was made by people whose intentions seem good, even if their ideology and analysis may be a touch simplistic. But what if a video with more sinister antecedents were to get this kind of viral boost? It suggests the old saying that \"a lie can run round the world before the truth has got its boots on\" is acquiring a chilling new resonance. The really interesting question, though, is whether this kind of development will further ratchet up the pressure on democratic politicians. The last two decades have shown how 24/7 media coverage of foreign atrocities can lead western leaders to morally driven interventionism. There comes a point when the shouting that \"something must be done\" can no longer be ignored. We saw this in Kosovo and Libya and we are now hearing it about Syria. If the Kony video does lead to increased US pressure on the Ugandan regime to catch the LRA leader then we'll know that the era of network power has finally arrived. But I wouldn't bet on it. John Naughton's book From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need to Know about the Internet has recently been published by Quercus Books \u2022 The following correction was published on 18 March 2012: Identity crises: the actor Bruno Ganz is Swiss, not German (\"They can be funny, sweet and flippant\", In Focus); the sculptor Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966) was Swiss, not Italian (\"The man who stood witness for the world\", New Review); Het Laatste Nieuws is a Belgian newspaper, not a Dutch one (\"Bestseller joins the Nordic invasion of Britain\", News) and we described RTBF as a French TV channel, when it is a French-speaking Belgian TV station (\"Hazard lights up on the Spurs radar\", Sport).",

      "body": "<p>The mainstream media were transfixed last week by a meme \u2013 an infectious idea. Hard-bitten news editors \u2013 the professionals who pride themselves on knowing what will happen before it happens \u2013 were discomfited to discover that their teenage kids knew something they didn't know. That something was a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc\" title=\"\">YouTube video</a> that had been spreading at an astonishing rate. Entitled <em>Kony 2012</em>, it is a 30-minute film made by a campaigning organisation called Invisible Children.</p> <p>Its goal was to raise awareness of the activities of Joseph Kony, a Ugandan warlord who leads the Lord's Resistance Army, in the hope of bringing him to justice. Kony and his LRA are distinguished by their violence and brutality, their <a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2006/06/29/just-how-crazy-is-joseph-kony/\" title=\"\">weird ideology</a> and \u2013 crucially for the purposes of the video \u2013 their practice of abducting children and turning them into child soldiers. This last practice has led to the bizarre phenomenon of \"night commuting\", in which Ugandan children leave their villages at night in order to sleep in towns, where they are supposedly less vulnerable to kidnapping by Kony and his goons.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_children#History_of_Invisible_Children\" title=\"\">Invisible Children</a> is a US-based campaigning group, founded in 2004 by film-makers, which has been working in Uganda \u2013 building radio networks, monitoring LRA movements and helping displaced children and families.</p> <p>It has focused on raising awareness of the LRA and on influencing US government policy towards the region. It is believed that its campaigning was at least partly responsible for Barack Obama's decision in 2010 to send 100 military advisers to the Ugandan military to assist in capturing Kony.</p> <p>The YouTube video is a brilliant piece of film-making, in two ways. First, it has a compelling, simple narrative: Kony is a really bad guy and his capture will end suffering for the people of northern Uganda. If US viewers do their bit by influencing their politicians, the world's superpower will take action and Kony will be captured.</p> <p>Second, it conveys this message in a seductive way, with film-maker Jason Williams explaining to his five-year-old son that this Kony is a monster and that dad's job is capturing him. What's not to like?</p> <p>Jason's message was released last Monday. By Thursday it had amassed 26 million views. When I last looked at it on Saturday it was up to 63 million views (with 1,212,109 \"likes\" and only 59,702 \"dislikes\"). So, in the jargon of the day, it's \"gone viral\". In that sense, it represents the most successful manipulation of our new media ecosystem to date because \"virality\" is what every huckster, politician and advertiser now craves \u2013 but very few achieve.</p> <p>Viral dissemination has been a feature of the internet almost from the beginning, but the deliberate exploitation of it dates from Independence Day in the US in 1996, when Hotmail was launched by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith. It was the first \"webmail\" system (allowing people to send and receive email using an internet browser) and its makers had the brilliant idea of appending a footer to every message sent stating that it had been sent by Hotmail and inviting the recipient to \"get a free Hotmail account\" at www.hotmail.com.</p> <p>Viral dissemination received a really powerful boost with the launch of YouTube in 2005. Thereafter, people were able to post striking, amusing or daft videos online and the service made it easy to \"share\" anything that viewers liked. This is what led to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat\" title=\"\">LOLcat explosion</a> and the astonishing viewing totals for charming videos like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he5fpsmH_2g\" title=\"\"><em>Charlie Bit My Finger,</em></a> which has been watched more than 12 million times since it first appeared in 2007.</p> <p>Viral dissemination was also responsible for making Bruno Ganz, the actor who played Adolf Hitler in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163\" title=\"\"><em>Downfall</em></a>, the 2004 film about the last days of Hitler, into the most famous German actor in the world [see footnote] \u2013 though in this case the makers of the film came to regard its online notoriety as a mixed blessing as parodies of one of its climactic scenes started to spread virally across the network.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics\" title=\"\">According to YouTube</a>, 60 hours of video material are uploaded to it every minute \u2013 an hour a second. In the midst of such abundance, how can anything get noticed? Attention is now the scarcest commodity in cyberspace \u2013 which explains why virality is so craved by those with things to sell or messages to transmit. In that sense, the most significant thing about the Kony video is that it represents the most successful exploitation of virality to date. But when you delve deeper, it turns out that its success owes something to network theory as well as to storytelling craft.</p> <p>Many years ago, the Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter <a href=\"http://sociology.stanford.edu/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf\" title=\"\">published a seminal article</a> in the <em>American Journal of Sociology</em> on the special role of \"weak ties\" in networks \u2013 links among people who are not closely bonded \u2013 as being critical for spreading ideas and for helping people join together for action.</p> <p>An examination of the spread of the Kony video suggests that one weak tie in particular may have been critical in launching it to its present eminence. Her name is Oprah Winfrey and she tweeted: \"Have watched the film. Had them on show last year\" on 6 March, after which the graph of YouTube views of the video switches to the trajectory of a bat out of hell. Winfrey, it turns out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/Oprah\" title=\"\">has 9.7 million followers on&#xa0;Twitter</a>.</p> <p>The Kony video and the assumptions behind it have been subjected to searching criticism by scholars like Ethan Zuckerman, <a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2012/03/08/unpacking-kony-2012\" title=\"\">who have challenged its simplistic analysis of a complex country and its ideological biases</a> \u2013 for example its implicit assumption that Africans are hopeless and that the only solutions to their problems can come from white foreigners. Some have suggested that the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, is no angel either. And there has been a fierce online debate about the ethical dilemmas of viral transmission.</p> <p>\"<em>Kony</em> is like a Rorschach test on to which we inscribe our own simplistically naive ethical calculus,\" wrote one commentator. Others observe that \"sharing\" the video gives people the opportunity of salving their consciences without doing anything serious about the problem of northern Uganda. And so on.</p> <p>The dissemination of the Kony meme does raise interesting questions for the future. It's the most dramatic demonstration so far of how an idea can spread over the globe via a channel that is beyond the reach and control of established media outlets. YouTube can't compete with conventional broadcasting at reaching billions of people instantaneously. But it operates outside the control of conventional gatekeepers and editorial sieves. And a third of the world's population now uses the internet, so the video could, in time, reach an awful lot of people.</p> <p>And what about truth, lies and propaganda? The Kony video was made by people whose intentions seem good, even if their ideology and analysis may be a touch simplistic. But what if a video with more sinister antecedents were to get this kind of viral boost? It suggests the old saying that \"a lie can run round the world before the truth has got its boots on\" is acquiring a chilling new resonance.</p> <p>The really interesting question, though, is whether this kind of development will further ratchet up the pressure on democratic politicians. The last two decades have shown how 24/7 media coverage of foreign atrocities can lead western leaders to morally driven interventionism.</p> <p>There comes a point when the shouting that \"something must be done\" can no longer be ignored. We saw this in Kosovo and Libya and we are now hearing it about Syria. If the Kony video does lead to increased US pressure on the Ugandan regime to catch the LRA leader then we'll know that the era of network power has finally arrived. But I wouldn't bet on it.</p> <p><em>John Naughton's book </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780857384256\" title=\"\"><em>From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need to Know about the Internet </em></a><em>has recently been published by Quercus Books</em></p> <p>\u2022 The following correction was published on 18 March 2012:<br>Identity crises: the actor Bruno Ganz is Swiss, not German (\"They can be funny, sweet and flippant\", In Focus); the sculptor Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966) was Swiss, not Italian (\"The man who stood witness for the world\", New Review); Het Laatste Nieuws is a Belgian newspaper, not a Dutch one (\"Bestseller joins the Nordic invasion of Britain\", News) and we described RTBF as a French TV channel, when it is a French-speaking Belgian TV station (\"Hazard lights up on the Spurs radar\", Sport).<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost six out of 10 teenage mothers are continuing to smoke during pregnancy \u2013 despite a significant decline in the number of younger people smoking over the past year. The figures have dismayed experts and could mean the government will miss key targets for improving the nation's health. The issue of young mothers who smoke while pregnant was in the spotlight last week when celebrity Stacey Solomon, who made her name as an X-Factor finalist, admitted she was still smoking two months before she was due to give birth. Amid the ensuing furore, Solomon was publicly stripped of her celebrity mum of the year title by a gambling website. Department of Health data, published on the first anniversary of health secretary Andrew Lansley's tobacco control plan, shows the percentage of people in England who smoke has fallen from 21% to 20% over the past year. There was a 5% decline in the number of younger smokers, with younger women in particular turning away from cigarettes. Over the past 10 years the proportion of teenage girls who smoke has fallen to an all-time low, from 31% to 17%. But one in four women smokes during part of her pregnancy as the long-term decline in smoking in pregnancy has all but come to a halt. And a particular concern is smoking among pregnant teenagers. A meeting of experts at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health heard that nearly six out of 10 pregnant teenagers smoke. Only around a third of them managed to quit, compared with around two thirds of older mothers. The meeting heard that depressed women are up to four times more likely to smoke during pregnancy than non-depressed women, and that between 25% to 50% of pregnant smokers have mental health problems. The government wants to reduce the percentage of women who smoke at the time of delivery to 11% by 2015. But the figure dropped by just 0.1% last year to 13.4%, largely because teenage mothers decline to stop, suggesting the target will not be achieved. Socioeconomic factors are thought to play a key role in determining whether teenagers smoke during pregnancy and whether they will quit. According to Action on Smoking and Health, Ash, women from routine and manual groups are almost three times as likely to smoke as women classed \"managerial and professional\". Sociologists suggest that for teenagers smoking is often the norm. In contrast, women who have babies later are much more likely to come from communities where smoking is less common. \"The number of teenagers who smoke is falling fast, but you have to ask yourself, are the most disadvantaged young people getting left behind?\" said Martin Dockrell, director of policy and research at Ash. \"When you look at the figures about smoking among teenagers, you are looking at young women with a double disadvantage. First, these are young women approaching the peak age for smoking. By the time women reach 25 they start to quit in large numbers. \"Second, better-off women tend to have their children later, so these are women, on the whole, not just younger but also less well off.\" The analysis suggests health officials need to find new ways of encouraging teenage mothers to stop smoking. It complements research by Professor Hilary Graham of York University's department of health sciences that has found education, the age of becoming a mother and lone parenthood are all linked to a greater incidence of smoking during pregnancy. Graham has argued that government policy on smoking has led to public vilification of disadvantaged groups \u2013 including teenage mothers who are seen as \"Vicky Pollard\" style characters. As a result, the current government strategy of \"promoting lifestyles more commonly found in middle-class communities is unlikely to promote social cohesiveness\", Graham argues. \"Research shows that the health behaviours of those around us \u2013 be that smoking or quitting \u2013 make a bigger difference to our own behaviours than we realise,\" Dockrell said. \"I think that's part of the reason why younger women are not just more likely to smoke but also much less likely to quit.\"",

      "bodyText": "Dr Marty Klein pulled no punches when it came to what he thought of the ferocious debate in America over contraception. As the nation's political classes veer between condemning government funding for birth control and defending it as a basic women's right, the California sex therapist and author of America's War on Sex bluntly said his country was on a perilous path. \"America has entered a new dark age where people are proud of their ignorance,\" he told the Observer. \"The US is careering towards a society that is reshaping women's reproductive rights. It used to be abortion. Now it's contraception. How can contraception be a battleground? It is crazy.\" That might be so, but the spat is white hot and part of a much larger argument. Only last week protests broke out in Texas, Arizona, Utah, Georgia and Alabama that all involved some aspects of sex and sexuality. In Utah, it was over the passing of a law that means the only sex education children will get in school will be about abstinence. In Texas, it was about cuts to health insurance that covers birth control. In Georgia, eight of the nine women in the state senate walked out over a bill that attacked abortion rights. Barely a day has gone by in recent weeks without some fresh fight breaking out over sexual politics. The most fierce was over radio shock jock Rush Limbaugh's comments on Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke, who had testified in Congress on the importance of government mandated funding for birth control. Limbaugh told millions of conservative listeners that this made Fluke a \"slut\" and \"prostitute\". He said: \"If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.\" The comments sparked outrage, triggered an advertiser boycott of Limbaugh's show and dragged in all the Republican nomination candidates and Barack Obama. Limbaugh apologised, but many liberals saw it as a sign of the powerful forces on the right determined to undo decades of advancement in sex and women's rights. Few people symbolise that more than former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who is now the main challenger to Mitt Romney for the Republican presidential nomination. A devout Catholic and hardened culture warrior, Santorum is a hero to conservatives for his hardline views on abortion and contraception. For Nancy Cohen, author of the current hit book Delirium: How the Sexual Counter-Revolution is Polarising America, Santorum's rise is the inevitable result of decades of backlash against 1960s sexual liberation. \"It is insanity to be having this conversation in our politics when you are a world power. The rest of the world is watching with their jaws agape,\" she said. But the image of America gripped by a fervent new puritanism is not the full picture. Any survey of the wider cultural landscape reveals sex has never been more prevalent in American life. On television and in movies sex is everywhere. Reality shows like The Jersey Shore show their cast members coupling with each other and random strangers. Stars such as Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, built lucrative businesses on the back of sex tapes. Gossip websites debate the sex lives of celebrities with a prurient detail that would shock even the most infamous of scandal rags from Hollywood in the 1930s, and they do it for an audience online of millions. Sex sells like never before, even for the most tangential of products. In sport there is even a Lingerie Football League, whose female players done skimpy outfits and teams have names like the Los Angeles Temptation. The American sex industry is said to be worth more than $12bn a year. Recent regulations in California aimed at ensuring all porn actors have to use condoms saw protests that such a law would see the industry relocate, with a resultant loss of jobs and taxes. At the same time porn actor James Deen has been cast as the lead in a new Hollywood film The Canyons. Deen has now become such a popular porn star \u2013 especially with young women \u2013 that he was the subject of a segment on ABC's headline news show Nightline. In fact, sexual freedom in America has gone so far that conservatives are not the only ones wringing their hands. The sexualisation of young girls \u2013 such as Bratz dolls with their bee-stung lips and short skirts \u2013 has outraged liberals and feminists, as has the growth of a casual \"hook up\" culture on American college campuses. Even Klein admits that \u2013 sexually speaking \u2013 Americans have never been so inventive. \"The range of things that people do in their bedrooms is without doubt getting broader and the entertainment options around sex are also broader,\" he said. But how to explain such vibrant sexual freedoms alongside such a widespread backlash? \"Two words: mental illness!\" joked Klein. \"When people ask me is America getting more progressive sexually or is it getting more conservative, I just answer: 'Yes'.\" Cohen has a thesis. In her book she describes a \"shadow movement\" that has aggressively campaigned to set back women's rights, focused on issues around sex and birth control. It is, she says, largely motivated by religion. That gives it a powerful motivation and it has developed sophisticated techniques to influence mainstream politics, especially via the social-conservative wing of the Republican party. Klein believes it gives the movement power far beyond its numbers and a louder voice than a more silent majority. \"These people are brilliant political organisers. They are ideologues and crusaders. They believe if they lose, civilisation hangs in the balance,\" he said. Unique factors in American history also help to explain the situation. Religion continues to play a big role in public life, which stands in stark contrast to many European countries. About 43% of Americans regularly go to church and it is hard to have a political career in the US without professing a deep faith. The power of religion provides a ready-made vehicle for campaigning on sexual mores. It also means sex is the one part of life where the normal rules of the free market are given a willful pass. \"The only place in life in America where more freedom of choice is seen as bad is sex,\" said Klein. Many commentators say the hardline Protestantism of 17th-century settlers casts a long shadow over modern sexuality, leading to a distrust of sexual behaviour as pleasure and seeing it as a religious duty for reproduction. Certainly Santorum's pronouncements on the evil of contraception fit this narrative. Despite his Catholicism, Santorum is a huge hit with the evangelicals. But others say the Puritans have been misjudged by history. \"There is evidence they understood and celebrated sex within certain confines, like marriage,\" said Professor Thomas Foster, a cultural history expert at the Catholic DePaul University in Chicago. \"Puritans talk about the clitoris. My classes are always amazed when they hear about that,\" he added. Another theory is that American ideas about public and private morality are rooted in the nations' founding fathers. Whereas in France and Italy, there is little link seen between a politician's private life and political behaviour, in America the reverse is true. \"There was a sense with the founding fathers that the person who is virtuous in their private life is able to be virtuous in their public life,\" Foster said. Thus Bill Clinton's affair with a White House intern nearly destroyed his presidency. A final theory holds that, because America was founded as a revolutionary experiment against the autocracies of Europe, it has a very different sense of \"modernism\". While European countries have organically evolved social mores over centuries, America has always been in turmoil at the previous generation's social behaviour because such fights are locked into the nation's sense of self-invention. In this view, the current battle over contraception is simply yet another part of the American experience. \"These debates are old. They are as old as the first colonies,\" said Foster. Or to put it another way, the only thing more American than having sex is arguing about it. \u2022 What's your take on the so-called sexual counter-revolution? Is there a war on women?

      "body": "<p>Dr Marty Klein pulled no punches when it came to what he thought of the ferocious debate in America over contraception. As the nation's political classes veer between condemning government funding for birth control and defending it as a basic women's right, the California sex therapist and author of <em>America's War on Sex </em>bluntly said his country was on a perilous path.</p> <p>\"America has entered a new dark age where people are proud of their ignorance,\" he told the <em>Observer</em>. \"The US is careering towards a society that is reshaping women's reproductive rights. It used to be abortion. Now it's contraception. How can contraception be a battleground? It is crazy.\"</p> <p>That might be so, but the spat is white hot and part of a much larger argument. Only last week protests broke out in Texas, Arizona, Utah, Georgia and Alabama that all involved some aspects of sex and sexuality. In Utah, it was over the passing of a law that means the only sex education children will get in school will be about abstinence. In Texas, it was about cuts to health insurance that covers birth control. In Georgia, eight of the nine women in the state senate walked out over a bill that attacked abortion rights.</p> <p>Barely a day has gone by in recent weeks without some fresh fight breaking out over sexual politics. The most fierce was over radio shock jock Rush Limbaugh's comments on Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke, who had testified in Congress on the importance of government mandated funding for birth control. Limbaugh told millions of conservative listeners that this made Fluke a \"slut\" and \"prostitute\".</p> <p>He said: \"If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.\" The comments sparked outrage, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/05/rush-limbaugh-sincerely-sorry-aol?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">triggered an advertiser boycott of Limbaugh's show</a> and dragged in all the Republican nomination candidates and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/02/barack-obama-condemns-rush-limbaugh-slut-remarks\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a>.</p> <p>Limbaugh apologised, but many liberals saw it as a sign of the powerful forces on the right determined to undo decades of advancement in sex and women's rights. Few people symbolise that more than former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who is now the main challenger to Mitt Romney for the Republican presidential nomination.</p> <p>A devout Catholic and hardened culture warrior, Santorum is a hero to conservatives for his hardline views on abortion and contraception. For Nancy Cohen, author of the current hit book <em>Delirium: How the Sexual Counter-Revolution is Polarising America</em>, Santorum's rise is the inevitable result of decades of backlash against 1960s sexual liberation. \"It is insanity to be having this conversation in our politics when you are a world power. The rest of the world is watching with their jaws agape,\" she said.</p> <p>But the image of America gripped by a fervent new puritanism is not the full picture. Any survey of the wider cultural landscape reveals sex has never been more prevalent in American life. On television and in movies sex is everywhere.</p> <p>Reality shows like <em>The Jersey Shore</em> show their cast members coupling with each other and random strangers. Stars such as Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, built lucrative businesses on the back of sex tapes. Gossip websites debate the sex lives of celebrities with a prurient detail that would shock even the most infamous of scandal rags from Hollywood in the 1930s, and they do it for an audience online of millions.</p> <p>Sex sells like never before, even for the most tangential of products. In sport there is even a Lingerie Football League, whose female players done skimpy outfits and teams have names like the Los Angeles Temptation.</p> <p>The American sex industry is said to be worth more than $12bn a year. Recent regulations in California aimed at ensuring all porn actors have to use condoms saw protests that such a law would see the industry relocate, with a resultant loss of jobs and taxes. At the same time porn actor James Deen has been cast as the lead in a new Hollywood film <em>The Canyons</em>. Deen has now become such a popular porn star \u2013 especially with young women \u2013 that he was the subject of a segment on ABC's headline news show <em>Nightline</em>.</p> <p>In fact, sexual freedom in America has gone so far that conservatives are not the only ones wringing their hands. The sexualisation of young girls \u2013 such as Bratz dolls with their bee-stung lips and short skirts \u2013 has outraged liberals and feminists, as has the growth of a casual \"hook up\" culture on American college campuses. Even Klein admits that \u2013 sexually speaking \u2013 Americans have never been so inventive. \"The range of things that people do in their bedrooms is without doubt getting broader and the entertainment options around sex are also broader,\" he said. But how to explain such vibrant sexual freedoms alongside such a widespread backlash? \"Two words: mental illness!\" joked Klein. \"When people ask me is America getting more progressive sexually or is it getting more conservative, I just answer: 'Yes'.\"</p> <p>Cohen has a thesis. In her book she describes a \"shadow movement\" that has aggressively campaigned to set back women's rights, focused on issues around sex and birth control. It is, she says, largely motivated by religion. That gives it a powerful motivation and it has developed sophisticated techniques to influence mainstream politics, especially via the social-conservative wing of the Republican party. Klein believes it gives the movement power far beyond its numbers and a louder voice than a more silent majority. \"These people are brilliant political organisers. They are ideologues and crusaders. They believe if they lose, civilisation hangs in the balance,\" he said.</p> <p>Unique factors in American history also help to explain the situation. Religion continues to play a big role in public life, which stands in stark contrast to many European countries. About 43% of Americans regularly go to church and it is hard to have a political career in the US without professing a deep faith. The power of religion provides a ready-made vehicle for campaigning on sexual mores. It also means sex is the one part of life where the normal rules of the free market are given a willful pass. \"The only place in life in America where more freedom of choice is seen as bad is sex,\" said Klein.</p> <p>Many commentators say the hardline Protestantism of 17th-century settlers casts a long shadow over modern sexuality, leading to a distrust of sexual behaviour as pleasure and seeing it as a religious duty for reproduction. Certainly Santorum's pronouncements on the evil of contraception fit this narrative. Despite his Catholicism, Santorum is a huge hit with the evangelicals. But others say the Puritans have been misjudged by history.</p> <p>\"There is evidence they understood and celebrated sex within certain confines, like marriage,\" said Professor Thomas Foster, a cultural history expert at the Catholic DePaul University in Chicago. \"Puritans talk about the clitoris. My classes are always amazed when they hear about that,\" he added.</p> <p>Another theory is that American ideas about public and private morality are rooted in the nations' founding fathers. Whereas in France and Italy, there is little link seen between a politician's private life and political behaviour, in America the reverse is true. \"There was a sense with the founding fathers that the person who is virtuous in their private life is able to be virtuous in their public life,\" Foster said. Thus Bill Clinton's affair with a White House intern nearly destroyed his presidency.</p> <p>A final theory holds that, because America was founded as a revolutionary experiment against the autocracies of Europe, it has a very different sense of \"modernism\". While European countries have organically evolved social mores over centuries, America has always been in turmoil at the previous generation's social behaviour because such fights are locked into the nation's sense of self-invention. In this view, the current battle over contraception is simply yet another part of the American experience.</p> <p>\"These debates are old. They are as old as the first colonies,\" said Foster. Or to put it another way, the only thing more American than having sex is arguing about it.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>What's your take on the so-called sexual counter-revolution? Is there a war on women?

      "bodyText": "Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has told Kofi Annan, the joint UN and Arab League envoy, that there can be no political progress in his country while \"terrorist groups\" are \"spreading chaos\". \"Syria is ready to make a success of any honest effort to find a solution for the events it is witnessing,\" the Syrian Arab news agency quoted Assad as saying. \"No political dialogue or political activity can succeed while there are armed terrorist groups operating and spreading chaos and instability.\" The rebuff to the peace mission of Annan, the former UN secretary-general, who travelled to Damascus to seek an end to the violence, came as Syrian troops launched a fresh assault on Idlib city, and international divisions over the Syrian crisis multiplied. According to the state news agency, Assad told Annan that, while his country was ready for \"any honest effort\" to settle almost a year of violence, his precondition was the cessation of attacks by armed opposition groups. Annan's visit marks a new international push for peace nearly a year after protesters took to the streets to demand Assad's removal from power, inspired by Arab spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Despite the violence, which according to the UN has claimed more than 7,500 lives, the international community has been extremely reluctant to back military intervention. Since then, the regime has dispatched snipers, tanks and civilian gunmen to crush dissent. The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon told reporters on Friday that Annan's priority in visiting Syria had been to halt all fighting by government forces and rebels \u2013 if not simultaneously, then first by government troops, followed by the opposition. Ban said a ceasefire should be quickly followed by inclusive talks to resolve the year-long conflict. Diplomats have said this could prove difficult because opposition leaders have already rejected calls for dialogue, saying only more military aid can stop Assad's deadly crackdown. The meeting came as opposition activists reported a new government assault on Idlib, in the north west of the country. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the government was shelling the Idlib region after tanks moved towards the area in recent days. There was no independent confirmation, but smoke rose into the sky behind some apartment buildings, according to an Associated Press team in the area. Some families were seen fleeing, clutching their belongings. Reinforcements have been pouring into Idlib for days, including dozens of tanks and armoured personnel carriers, activists said. The operation has raised fears that the regime is planning a new, all-out offensive in Idlib like the bloody siege last month that captured a restive part of the city of Homs, further south. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov sought to defend his country's stance to Arab leaders angered by Moscow's blocking tactics. Last month, just as the Homs offensive was becoming more intense, Russia and China vetoed a draft UN security council resolution that would have supported an Arab League peace plan calling on Assad to hand over powers. That brought accusations that Russia, a longtime Assad ally, was giving the regime diplomatic cover to intensify the crackdown. \"We are not protecting any regimes,\" Lavrov insisted at a heated session of the Arab League in Cairo on Saturday. \"We are protecting international law\u2026 We are not looking for a special prize or geopolitical interest here.\" He said Russia was trying to prevent \"interference in domestic affairs of states, not to mention military interference\" \u2013 something he hinted other Arab countries should be concerned about, given the upheaval of the Arab spring over the past year. \"We certainly believe that all outside actors must be extremely careful in addressing problems which your countries are facing,\" he said. He said Russia was trying to \"promote a peaceful resolution\" to Syria's crisis and that the immediate mission now is to halt violence and enable humanitarian assistance to reach those in need. Qatar's prime minister sharply criticised Lavrov's remarks. Speaking after him, he said: \"There is systematic genocide by the Syrian government.\"",

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the government was shelling the Idlib region after tanks moved towards the area in recent days.</p> <p>There was no independent confirmation, but smoke rose into the sky behind some apartment buildings, according to an Associated Press team in the area. Some families were seen fleeing, clutching their belongings. Reinforcements have been pouring into Idlib for days, including dozens of tanks and armoured personnel carriers, activists said. The operation has raised fears that the regime is planning a new, all-out offensive in Idlib like the bloody siege last month that captured a restive part of the city of Homs, further south.</p> <p>Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov sought to defend his country's stance to Arab leaders angered by Moscow's blocking tactics. Last month, just as the Homs offensive was becoming more intense, Russia and China vetoed a draft UN security council resolution that would have supported an Arab League peace plan calling on Assad to hand over powers. That brought accusations that Russia, a longtime Assad ally, was giving the regime diplomatic cover to intensify the crackdown. \"We are not protecting any regimes,\" Lavrov insisted at a heated session of the Arab League in Cairo on Saturday. \"We are protecting international law\u2026 We are not looking for a special prize or geopolitical interest here.\"</p> <p>He said Russia was trying to prevent \"interference in domestic affairs of states, not to mention military interference\" \u2013 something he hinted other Arab countries should be concerned about, given the upheaval of the Arab spring over the past year. \"We certainly believe that all outside actors must be extremely careful in addressing problems which your countries are facing,\" he said.</p> <p>He said Russia was trying to \"promote a peaceful resolution\" to Syria's crisis and that the immediate mission now is to halt violence and enable humanitarian assistance to reach those in need. Qatar's prime minister sharply criticised Lavrov's remarks. Speaking after him, he said: \"There is systematic genocide by the Syrian government.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brace yourself for the most maritally divisive piece of news you'll hear all week: married women do more housework than their husbands. Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank shows that eight out of 10 married women do more household chores, while just one in 10 married men does an equal amount of cleaning and washing as his wife. Just over one in 10 women \u2013 13% \u2013 say their husbands do more housework than they do, while only 3% of married women do fewer than three hours a week, with almost half doing 13 hours or more. In short, the gender imbalance is alive and thriving in the British household, according to the IPPR, which says its research shows that, for real equality, society needs to see men to pick up the vacuum cleaner and do their fair share. Patterns of housework have changed only slightly. More than eight out of 10 women born in 1958 said they do more laundry and ironing than their partner, while seven out of 10 women born in 1970 agreed. \"The revolution in gender roles is unfinished business,\" said Nick Pearce, director of IPPR. \"Women still shoulder the overwhelming burden of household tasks, particularly after they have had children. When they earn more, their bargaining power with their partners increases, so closing the gender pay gap would help. Universal childcare, rather than tax relief for nannies or cleaners, is also the best way forward for a family-friendly, more equal Britain. \"On most key issues, the route to modern feminist goals must pass through fathers. Men should work more flexibly, take greater responsibility for caring for their children and their homes, and have the right to reserved parental leave,\" says the IPPR. Last month David Cameron said that tax relief for people paying domestic staff, what critics call the \"butler tax break\", was \"an interesting idea I want to look at further\". The Swedish and Finnish governments allow people to deduct half the cost of household services such as cleaning, cooking, lawn-mowing and babysitting from their tax bills. It is said to have created more than 5,000 jobs in Sweden. But the IPPR says that just entrenches gender injustice and only universal childcare can help beleaguered parents from being forced into traditional \"breadwinner and homemaker\" roles. \"Whenever we ask women about the most stressful thing in their lives, housework is at the top,\" said Siobhan Freegard of Netmums. \"Nobody lies on their deathbed thinking, 'I wish I'd kept up with the housework', but it is a serious issue dividing couples and we have to ask why it comes back time and again. Are we really genetically programmed to be keeping the cave tidy while the man goes off to hunt? We're educated women, does housework really matter? Why do we care about it so much? Is it natural instinct or the root of inequality? Our kids see us arguing about it all the time and what are we saying to them about equality for women? \"For a long time it has been unfashionable to say that some women want to stay at home, to the point where women are now asking what happened to choice. Well, choice is gone for most women now. If you can afford to outsource cleaning and childcare, then you can keep your career, but we find it hard to outsource those roles. Maybe we disempower men. Women just get so fed up having to nag to get their partner to wash up that they do it themselves. We see women discussing what tricks to use \u2013 withholding nookie is popular!\" Academic and blogger Shehnaz Suterwalla said: \"We've come full circle from the beginnings of feminism in the 1970s, when women were rejecting the traditional homemaker role and moving out of the house. Now it's a space they are reclaiming, as we can see from the proliferation of television programmes and books about home crafts and decorating. \"But if women are reclaiming that space, seeing it as something productive and useful, then it still remains a source of tension and frustration within their relationships if there isn't a willingness from men to contribute. \"Things are changing for women but men have yet to catch up. For some, the home has become this constantly made-over, beautified status symbol. What it means for men within that kind of space is yet to be understood, but I'd think they'd feel quite intimidated,\" she said. But a straw poll on Netmums tended to veer towards \"lazy\" rather than \"intimidated\" to describe the men in their lives. While single mothers pointed out that they had no choice, a common thread was frustration. \"My partner works and pays all the bills. Sometimes I still feel it would be nice if he offered to at least do something but he doesn't and never has and probably never will,\" said Nikki Payne. \"His opinion is he works, so why should he? I also work. \"I think if I worked full-time he would still do diddly squat and it would be left for me. I mean, I am talking about a bloke who can't even change a loo roll.\"",

The fidgety Yank versus the mellow Englishman versus the geeky ingenue is no one's idea of an ageless triumvirate but in the here and now, in a week when they have dominated the upper reaches of the leaderboard, there is enough contrast in personality and style of play to hold the attention. Watson gives the ball a lash with a quirky swing and then sets off in pursuit. Rose is more of a scientist, plotting his way around with quiet aplomb. Bradley lies somewhere between the two extremes \u2013 a bomber off the tee, a librarian around the greens. He is a major champion, a better player than many gave him credit for after his win at last year's PGA Championship in Atlanta. On Friday, Watson ripped this place apart with a 10-under par 62, with his Englishman playing partner only two shots worse. Neither man played as well on Saturday, but they did not exactly embarrass themselves either, with Watson signing for a five-under-par 67 and Rose for a 69. They would have played together for a fourth successive day had not the Englishman three-putted the final green, dropping into a tie for second place with Bradley on 14-under par for the tournament, three shots behind the leader. In a different week, on a different course, a three-shot advantage might have been cause for a restful Saturday night's slumber but not on the so-called \"Blue Monster\". \"A resort course,\" McIlroy called the layout after his round. This was not meant to be a compliment and the Northern Irishman threw in another adjective: outdated. \"They definitely need to do something with it,\" he said. When a professional golfer complains about a layout it can be taken as read that he has just endured a torrid day. This was not the case with the world No1, who made his comments after signing for a seven-under-par 65 and a tie for ninth place \u2013 a great score and a good position by any measure but it seems McIlroy is measured differently these days, even by himself. He was disappointed, he said, after playing his opening nine holes in six under par. He then eagled the par-five 10th hole and birdied the 12th, opening up the possibility of the breaking 60. Alas it was not to be, as a pair of careless bogeys on the back nine stalled his momentum. Tiger Woods was no less impressive over his opening stretch, hitting birdies on his first three holes, but he too faltered on the back nine. The two men, who seemed destined to battle out it out at next month's Masters, will start the final round on nine under par, eight shots behind the leader. \"I never thought I would stand up here and say I'm disappointed with seven-under but today is definitely one of those days,\" McIlroy said. \"It's OK. It would have been nice to post something \u2013 61, 62 or whatever \u2013 but at least I've put myself sort of back into the tournament and given myself a chance to post a high finish, at least. So that's a positive.\" The good news is that something is to be done about the course now that it has been bought by Donald Trump. The even better news is that Trump has hired the golf course architect Gil Hanse to redesign the place. Hanse is hardly a household name, but he is adored by the cognoscenti, both the players and the critics in the peanut gallery \u2013 a status reflected in the decision to give him the honour of designing the course that will be used when the sport returns to the Olympics at Rio in 2016. The quiet American \"gets it\", as the saying goes.

Delegates at the party's spring conference in Gateshead decided not to back an emergency motion urging the withdrawal or defeat of the health and social care bill. The decision is a victory for the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg. Liberal Democrat leaders were desperate to avoid deserting the much-criticised shakeup of the NHS in England at the last minute after nearly a year of stormy parliamentary passage and amendments. Party activists have instead chosen to debate the pro-leadership Shirley Williams health motion on Sunday. Although it is possible that the Williams motion could be defeated, having the conference vote against a pro-bill motion would be less embarrassing for Clegg than having it vote in favour of a motion saying the bill should be dropped. Clegg said on Saturday that the bill, which is opposed by staff bodies including the British Medical Association and several royal colleges, has changed \"out of all recognition\". \"I think it's a really good thing that Liberal Democrats worry as much as we do about something as precious as the NHS,\" he said. \"I think it would be a dereliction of duty if we didn't really really examine hard whether the changes we've introduced in the NHS are the right ones.\" He said the changes made sure that competition and commercial interests would not undermine the NHS and would bring about \"greater equality\" for patients. But union leaders warned the party faced a wipeout at the next election over its support for the bill. Williams said: \"The facts are the Lib Dems have hugely altered this bill to make a way that makes an acceptable, genuine health service. \"I am sorry about how we got here. But now we're here, we've done huge amounts to reform the bill and make it back to something that supports and doesn't undermine the NHS.\"",

Although it is possible that the Williams motion could be defeated, having the conference vote against a pro-bill motion would be less embarrassing for Clegg than having it vote in favour of a motion saying the bill should be dropped.</p> <p>Clegg said on Saturday that the bill, which is opposed by staff bodies including the British Medical Association and several royal colleges, has changed \"out of all recognition\".</p> <p>\"I think it's a really good thing that Liberal Democrats worry as much as we do about something as precious as the NHS,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I think it would be a dereliction of duty if we didn't really really examine hard whether the changes we've introduced in the NHS are the right ones.\"</p> <p>He said the changes made sure that competition and commercial interests would not undermine the NHS and would bring about \"greater equality\" for patients.</p> <p>But union leaders warned the party faced a wipeout at the next election over its support for the bill.</p> <p>Williams said: \"The facts are the Lib Dems have hugely altered this bill to make a way that makes an acceptable, genuine health service.</p> <p>\"I am sorry about how we got here. But now we're here, we've done huge amounts to reform the bill and make it back to something that supports and doesn't undermine the NHS.\"</p>",

An exit from the Scottish Cup would all but end either of these teams' season, a matter only endorsed by the toe-to-toe manner of this match. There were even smatterings of controversy. Hearts will be sore about conceding the 2-1 advantage over St Mirren they held with just six minutes remaining. Yet such sentiment belies the visitors' opening to the game, amid which they could class themselves as unfortunate not to be at least three goals ahead. In proving the Scottish Cup retains a sense of occasion and importance, Hearts roused themselves to dominate their own spell before a Marius Zaliukas own goal ensured the teams must play this quarter-final all over again. If Hearts are to claim the cup, they seem determined to do it the hard way. A scrappy win over non-league Auchinleck Talbot was followed by an extra-time win over St Johnstone. Now Paulo Sergio's team face a testing trip to Paisley on Wednesday week. \"We have to believe we are ready to go there and fight to go through to the next round,\" said the Hearts manager. \"I believe we can do it and I think the players believe that too.\" Steven Thompson had already wasted a fine opportunity to send St Mirren in front by the time they were denied a decent penalty claim. For that, Danny Grainger seemed to handle Gary Teale's shot. Paul McGowan and Nigel Hasselbaink passed up further St Mirren chances before the clock had even reached 12 minutes. The St Mirren manager, Danny Lennon, later hailed his players' start as \"exceptional.\" Sergio concurred. \"In the first 30 minutes, St Mirren were the best team I had seen at Tynecastle all season,\" he insisted. Hearts' response came via Andrew Driver, who had an effort smartly saved by Craig Samson. The winger is due credit; had Driver tumbled under a challenge from Lee Mair rather than had an attempt on goal, he may well have won a penalty. Another set-play, a free-kick, triggered the opening goal St Mirren fully merited. Hearts' Adrian Mrowiec scandalously passed the ball straight to Hasselbaink, with Andy Webster subsequently adjudged \u2013 harshly, it must be said \u2013 to have fouled the forward 19 yards from goal. Graham Carey, something of an expert in such situations, exploited a gap in the Hearts wall to curl home a low finish. It was that intervention which properly awoke Hearts. Craig Beattie, in his first start for the club, headed a Grainger corner past Samson. Only a dreadful act of officialdom denied Beattie another goal before the interval; the forward did not even seem close to offside when an errant Gary Cheyne flag deemed otherwise. Sergio had withdrawn the hapless Mrowiec and replaced him with Rudi Skacel, a player who specialises in goals against St Mirren. And so it proved once again, the Czech heading in Beattie's cross to edge Hearts in front. Only an excellent Jim Goodwin tackle prevented Skacel from an almost certain brace moments later. As Beattie blasted over from 16 yards, it was Hearts who had reasonable cause to rue a lack of ruthlessness. That duly came back to haunt them. There was an element of farce about the fourth goal of the encounter, with Teale's shot scrambled towards Hasselbaink. The Dutchman claimed he was trying to score despite an impossible angle; in any case, the ball took a crucial deflection off Zaliukas, the Hearts captain, to stun the home support. Sergio complained at the time about a tug on his midfielder Ian Black in the build-up to the equaliser, although the manager refused to dwell on that afterwards. Hearts, instead, now a hazardous replay to occupy their thoughts.",

It was Clint Hill's phantom one in the first half that consumed the thoughts of all as they departed. \"From our point of view to have that clear goal chalked off was a significant moment for us,\" said the Queens Park Rangers manager, Mark Hughes, of Hill's header that clearly crossed the line. \"Don't underestimate the significance of scoring first. We were the away side, we are at the wrong end of the table, and to score first would have been crucial for us. Not getting a decision of that magnitude correct impacted on what we could get out of the game.\" \"We came with a positive attitude because I know that when you're at the bottom draws don't really move you. You need to win games. We deserved something out of the game, but all we ask for is a level playing field, so that if we get beaten fairly and squarely we will hold our hands up. We are big enough and brave enough to do that. But we are getting players sent off after 30 minutes, having penalty awards not given, and goals chalked off when they should be given.''. \"The situation we find ourselves in, we have to demand that their performance is better. We can't have the key moments in games being officiated the way they are at the moment.\" There were words of sympathy from the opposite dug-out. \"There is nobody who is a bigger advocate of goalline technology than me \u2013 the sooner it's brought in the better,\" said Owen Coyle. \"I can understand Mark Hughes's frustration but I have to credit my goalkeeper, Adam Bogdan, because it was a wonderful palm out.\" The moment of injustice came after 20 minutes when centre-back Hill met Joey Barton's corner from the left with a glancing close-range header that Bogdan clawed back into play via the underside of the bar from a position two feet over the line. Barton's delivery followed a pantomime prelude \u2013 first, a corner had been awarded despite the last touch being a brush against Djibril Ciss\u00e9's shirt, then Barton toyed with the referee, Martin Atkinson, by attempting to deliver the dead-ball from outside the arc \u2013 but humour was in short supply as Hill curtailed initial celebration. Assistant Bob Pollock \u2013 the official who enraged Tottenham by ruling out a legitimate Emmanuel Adebayor goal at Stoke for offside earlier this season \u2013 shook his head. So did Hughes as he departed at the interval. But for a contrasting reason. By then, the visitors were behind courtesy of Darren Pratley's 37th-minute header. They should not and would not have been but for sharper finishing or better fortune: Barton's measured sidefooter deflected wide, Bobby Zamora's volley from an acute angle kissed the crossbar and Shaun Wright-Phillips ballooned high and wide. To add to the drama, QPR levelled two minutes after the re-start through Ciss\u00e9's predatory flick of his right boot. Everyone, apart from Atkinson's other official Jake Collin, agreed that the French international was offside as Wright-Phillips dinked through the heart of Bolton's defence. Both managers made attacking changes in the final 10 minutes in a bid to secure all three points and although the visitors were denied three times in one manic late penalty area scramble, it was Coyle's decision to throw on the Croatian Klasnic that proved decisive, as he stroked in Ryo Miyaichi's cute assist four minutes from the end. \"It was sublime skill from Ryo, and when Klasnic goes in one on one with the goalkeeper there's only one thing that's going to happen,\" said Coyle, whose side climbed out of the bottom three as a consequence.

Meanwhile, Guardian readers were met with a piece by Polly Toynbee proclaiming that \"British women's freedoms have gone into reverse\". Well, that's Toynbee's view. Guardian readers won't be surprised to learn it's not mine. We differ on three fundamental points \u2013 one of principle, one of process and one of fact. First of all, on principle; Toynbee's view seems to think that human advancement can only come from state action. The logic of her argument is that there should therefore be no limit to state largesse \u2013 and that the more government spends on interventionist schemes, the freer women will be. I think that is not just foolish economics but also intellectually wrong. Yes, of course the state exists to protect rights and help those in trouble. But it's not a force for moral advancement in itself. The things that matter to me are freedom, opportunity, community and the individual. These are the things that make us human, the things that allow us to choose how to live our lives, the things that break down barriers to advancement that both Toynbee's view and I oppose. Second, on a point of process, we obviously disagree about the deficit. Toynbee's view may think that cuts are unnecessary and that borrowing can go on forever. I'd rather face up to reality. Paying our way in the world is not something that's good for men, or good for women \u2013 it's necessary and good for us all. I don't know one woman who would want to leave this debt for her children's generation to sort out. Third, on fact, her piece sidesteps the point that, amid the tough decisions, the effects on women are being ameliorated. The government is taking 1.1 million of the lowest paid workers, 58% of whom are women, out of income tax altogether. It's increasing child tax-credits for low-to-middle income families, while freezing council tax. Polly ends by bemoaning plans to tackle violence against women, including the millions of pounds directed to specialist domestic and sexual violence support services and to stalking helplines, as well as guarantees for legal aid for the domestic violence victims. This I find particularly shocking, and I say this having been a family lawyer at the coalface for the last 23 years. Now, of course the job isn't done. Times are tough and it's often women who bear the brunt \u2013 juggling duties like work, childcare, caring for elderly relatives, while, in many cases, trying to balance an ever-stretched family budget. And of course, there is progress to be made in the workplace. The glass ceiling may be well polished but it's as solid as ever, with women being paid 15% less than men and representing only 15% of FTSE 100 company directors. So FTSE 100 boards should aim for a minimum of 25% female representation by 2015. But compulsory quotas are a retrograde step; they mean women are seen as in a job because of their gender not their ability \u2013 and they are pointless because women can get there on their own merit. So let's use this time, in the wake of International Women's Day, to vow that we will continue on the path of equality \u2013 not Toynbee equality, where women are thrown scraps of state help, but true equality where they are given the power, the opportunity, and the future they deserve. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

I don't know one woman who would want to leave this debt for her children's generation to sort out.</p> <p>Third, on fact, her piece sidesteps the point that, amid the tough decisions, the effects on women are being ameliorated. The government is taking <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/latest_news_detail.aspx?title=More_money_back_in_your_pocket&amp;pPK=b0e7e552-2bcc-4bb8-a40b-9c1c216a3cee\" title=\"Liberal Democrats: More money in your back pocket\">1.1 million of the lowest paid workers</a>, 58% of whom are women, out of income tax altogether. It's increasing child tax-credits for low-to-middle income families, while freezing council tax.</p> <p>Polly ends by bemoaning <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/violence-against-women-girls/strategic-vision/\" title=\"Home Office: action plan\">plans to tackle violence against women</a>, including the millions of pounds directed to specialist domestic and sexual violence support services and to stalking helplines, as well as guarantees for legal aid for the domestic violence victims. This I find particularly shocking, and I say this having been a family lawyer at the coalface for the last 23 years.</p> <p>Now, of course the job isn't done. Times are tough and it's often women who bear the brunt \u2013 juggling duties like work, childcare, caring for elderly relatives, while, in many cases, trying to balance an ever-stretched family budget.</p> <p>And of course, there is progress to be made in the workplace. The glass ceiling may be well polished but it's as solid as ever, with women being paid 15% less than men and representing only 15% of FTSE 100 company directors. So FTSE 100 boards should aim for a minimum of 25% female representation by 2015. But compulsory quotas are a retrograde step; they mean women are seen as in a job because of their gender not their ability \u2013 and they are pointless because women can get there on their own merit.</p> <p>So let's use this time, in the wake of International Women's Day, to vow that we will continue on the path of equality \u2013 not Toynbee equality, where women are thrown scraps of state help, but true equality where they are given the power, the opportunity, and the future they deserve.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "This is a must-win game for both sides. Let's riff on QPR's pain first. They're in desperate bother. Hovering over the relegation dotted line, in 16th spot, six goals less useless than 18th-placed Wolves, they've only won one of their last 15 league games. Considering they've yet to play Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Sunderland, they're in a bit of a state. As for Bolton? They're below the line, in 19th place, two points behind QPR. But they're done with all of the big boys bar Tottenham now, and have a much, much easier run-in. Mind you, they've just lost four on the bounce, including defeats to supposedly easier opposition in Norwich and Wigan, so that favourable fixture list might not count for much. A must-win game for both sides, then. A relegation six-pointer, if you will. A winner-takes-all-the-points demotion brouhaha. Bolton may be the more confident, having won the opening game of the season against Rangers 4-0. But they are a shower, so maybe not. But QPR are a shambles, so maybe. I really have to finish this paragraph now. Kick off: 12.45pm. Bolton Wanderers: Bogdan, Steinsson, Wheater, Ream, Ricketts, Reo-Coker, Mark Davies, Pratley, Miyaichi, Ngog, Petrov. Subs: Jaaskelainen, Muamba, Eagles, Knight, Kevin Davies, Klasnic, Sordell. Queens Park Rangers: Kenny, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Hill, Traore, Barton, Diakite, Derry, Wright-Phillips, Cisse, Zamora. Subs: Cerny, Gabbidon, Bothroyd, Mackie, Buzsaky, Young, Taiwo. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) Anyway, never mind this football. Let's concentrate on the real issues. \"What do you think is worse, a shower or a shambles?\" asks philosophy's Patrick Cullen. \"At first I thought shambles, because you know a shower is temporary, the sun will shine again, and after all, it's only a shower, not a deluge or a monsoon. But then I thought about how a shambles just has to pull itself together to improve, something it can do from the one moment to the next, and not necessarily dependent on the rain stopping and the shower going away.\" Surely much depends on what the shower consists of. And its temperature. And whether it's being hosed straight between your eyes. The teams are out! Bolton are in their trademark dreadfully designed white shirts, QPR are in salmon pink. Or is it orange? Not sure. And don't care. \"I'm sure the idea of promotion/relegation for two years rather than one year has been kicked around before but I've missed said discussion,\" says Paul Taylor, of a subject that's news to me. \"Can a promoted club really make much progress financially (and on the pitch) playing for only one year in the big leagues?\" For the love of God, please be quiet, Paul. Someone from the SPL might be reading this, and you'll be giving them ideas. And we're off! Mark Hughes hasn't had a honeymoon period yet, the poor love. Could this be the start of something beautiful? His charges get the ball rolling, and hoick it straight out of play down the left, an agricultural hoof. The last live football match on British television was the Athletic Bilbao Show on Thursday evening. Compare and contrast. Best league in the world! 2 min: Ricketts gets busy down the left and wins a corner for Bolton. The first is wasted, but QPR put the ball behind again and it's another corner, giving Bolton the opportunity to waste another set piece. 3 min: From deep, Derry quarterbacks a pass down the left for Cisse, who isn't far from latching onto the ball. QPR have obviously decided to keep it basic this afternoon. 6 min: A lot of hoofing. It's a poor show so far, but let's give it a chance. \"As a shambles historically means a butcher's slaughterhouse then I'd guess that would be a worse thing to be, and frankly rather gruesome,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst. \"Not sure there is much way back for a team that have been turned into mince, sausages and chops. A shower could even be a good thing if it is a power shower, or discombobulating if it is a biblical shower like a shower of frogs.\" I suppose if you turn a poorly performing football squad into chops and sausages, you could at least recoup some of the cash wasted on the players by raffling a few trays off in the drinker on Sunday afternoon. Actually, Liverpool may want to consider this as a solution to the Carroll problem. 8 min: Pratley chases a ball down the inside-right channel and reaches it, plum on the byline, a few feet to the right of the QPR goal. He cuts an inviting ball back into the centre, but there's no Bolton player rushing in to take advantage. 9 min: A free kick to Bolton down the right. Wanderers load the box. Petrov swings a useless ball in, allowing first man Barton to clear. 10 min: Miyaichi rolls the ball inside from the right to Ngog. Then a nice bit of skill by the striker, who dinks a first-time ball past Hill down the inside-right channel, and runs after it himself, clear into the area. But that's the sum total of the excellence, as his subsequent shot is snatched miles wide left. That was Torresesque. 13 min: QPR aren't doing much at all. Cisse tries to make something happen down the right, chasing after a long ball, but can only slice a cross deep into the stand. He was never in control of that. 14 min: Miyaichi is looking lively down the Bolton right. He scampers into space and sees his cross hacked out for a corner. Miyaichi takes it himself. Wheater, from the penalty spot, aims a header towards the top right, but Ferdinand heads off the line and over for another corner. Which is wasted. But Bolton are beginning to look dangerous here. 15 min: And yet it's nearly QPR who take the lead, Wright-Phillips diddling down the inside-left channel, the ball eventually breaking infield, settling on the edge of the area for Barton, who's cutting in from the right. He takes a whack at goal, and the ball's deflected, wrongfooting Bogdan in the Bolton goal. Luckily for the home side, the ball flies wide right, and the subsequent corner is a joke. 17 min: Cisse, from the edge of the D, dinks a ball down the inside-left channel for Zamora, who smashes a shot from a tight angle off the crossbar and away. That's a wonderful effort. Rangers were not far short of appalling during the opening exchanges, but have suddenly woken up. 20 min: OUTRAGEOUS REFEREEING DECISION! QPR ROBBED! A corner for QPR down the left, after Cisse causes some bother in the box. It's swung into the Bolton six-yard box. Hill, coming in at the near post, stoops and powers a header over the line. Bogdan claws it out, in the Roy Carroll style; it's miles behind the line. But the linesman doesn't give the goal. That is a preposterous decision. QPR have the funk on, and no bloody wonder. 22 min: On the touchline, Mark Hughes is waving his arms around, mouthing words such as EFF and CEE. 23 min: Pratley hacks Diakite, a late slide. He's booked, and can have no complaints. The linesman central to the Hill Incident is, for the record, called Bob Pollock. The visiting Londoners, fond as they are of chatting in rhyme, will be in no doubt as to what said official has just dropped. 26 min: Pratley comes inside from the right and has a dig. The ball balloons off Hill and nearly finds the top left. It's only a corner, which is a complete waste of time. \"Now Steve Bruce has gone, are Owen Coyle and Mark Hughes the managers with the highest reputations and the fewest acheivements in the Premier League? I don't know how the media chooses its heroes and villains, but once in one camp, it seems to take a lot of shifting to end up in the other,\" writes Gary Naylor, of a phenomenon known as the Hodgson Law of Honour, or Roy's Rules of Renown. 29 min: That incident has taken quite a bit of wind from QPR's sails. And no wonder. Will you just look at that! 31 min: Wheater is booked for a tug on Cisse. \"Surely Andy Carroll would be sent to the knacker's yard to be boiled down for glue?\" asks Dennis Johns. \"Like poor old Boxer in Animal Farm, though Terry and Drogba are more the Napoleon and Snowball types. I'll put this analogy down now.\" Boxer was quite a willing worker, though, wasn't he? 33 min: A free kick for Bolton, 35 yards out, just to the right of goal. The home side load the box. Petrov can't beat the first man. The ball's cleared. Miyaichi looks to cushion it on his thigh and Le Tissier a volley goalwards, but Cisse nicks the ball from him and looks to break. Before losing control with options on either side and Bolton light at the back. This is a poor game on the whole. 35 min: Ngog rather saucily goes to ground in the box as he looks to turn Hill and get a shot away. It's not a penalty, and Hill isn't slow in telling the striker that, in the full and frank manner. That would have put the tin lid on Hill's half. 36 min: Diakite, sent off after 0.000000000004 seconds on his debut, is lucky to escape a booking for a ludicrous lunge on Steinsson. Free kick down the right for Bolton. From which... 37 min: GOAL! Bolton Wanderers 1-0 QPR. The free kick is worked right to left across the face of the QPR box. Finally, Petrov is sprung clear down the left. He stands the ball up into the centre, where Pratley powers a header home into the right-hand side of the net. Rangers, who should have been ahead, are now behind, and wearing the look of men about to sail the funk mothership into the heart of a blistering sun. 39 min: Wright Phillips has a chance to immediately level, with the ball in plenty of space down the inside-left channel, but his curler towards the top-right corner is all wrong. It flies miles wide right and high of goal. 42 min: Mark Davies and Onuoha come together down the right. A fair 50-50 challenge, but Davies has come off the worst. A stoppage. \"Grinding up a rubbish team for meat?\" splutters Mac Millings. \"Solving the Carroll problem? I can almost hear Charlton Heston now. 'Pointless Team is people!'\" 44 min: Stoppage over. Davies back up and running. \"This is a horrible advert for Premiership football,\" opines Alex Bishop. \"Everything about this game; the scrappy passing, poor finishing, bad refereeing, the half empty ground and that bloody song they played when Bolton scored!\" We're enjoying ourselves, aren't we. 45 min: QPR ping pretty triangles down the inside-right channel, Zamora and Cisse the skillsters. Eventually the ball's pinged to Onuoha, bombing down the right. He hammers it low and hard towards the Bolton net, but Bogdan hacks away with his feet. For the record, the ball was a few yards in front of the line. HALF TIME: Bolton Wanderers 1-0 Queens Park Rangers. And after a couple of minutes of added time, that is that. Hill wanders off shaking his head, the Rangers fans booing and chanting \"You don't know what you're doing\" to Mr Pollock. This could be an interesting second half if QPR come back out with the rage. HALF-TIME ADVERTISEMENT starring man with similar demeanour to, and cheery outlook on life as, Mark Hughes: \"It is not eggs, it is eels.\" And we're off again! No changes to either side. Bolton get the ball rolling for the second half. Sky have pointed out that Bolton may be cashing in some karma today, given that an over-the-line misjudgement by the referee against Everton effectively relegated them (and not Everton) back in 1997. Like QPR will care about that. Still, Bolton were due one I suppose, and QPR have one hell of a slice of luck coming to them in 2027. 48 min: GOAL! Bolton Wanderers 1-1 Queens Park Rangers. Diakite dinks a ball straight down the middle of the park to release Cisse, who slides the ball under Bogdan and home. That's so simple. And a good yard or two offside. Well, that's levelled things up. 51 min: Now it's Bolton's turn to wander about stunned. That shock at the start of the half has knocked them back on their heels. QPR aren't doing much at the moment either, but will be feeling mighty fine about themselves at the moment. \"You have a two-yard ghost goal in a crucial relegation match and all you can talk about is Andy Carroll??\" blasts a red-faced Mat Balco, barely able to focus on his computer screen, the light refracting through the hot salty tears. \"WTF?? Seriously?? Honestly pathetic.\" Sorry, Mat, that I've only so far mentioned it in the 22nd, 23rd, 29th, 35th and 45th minutes, in the descriptions of both goals, and the restart to the second half. And posted a picture of it. Just so I know next time, and in the interests of Open Journalism, what else did you want me to do? I live to dance little jigs. 54 min: Bolton are slowly recovering. Mark Davies is putting himself about, probing down both channels. QPR certainly don't look certain at the back, but that's hardly news. \"Hancock's wrong,\" writes Paul Gordon. \"It's eggs.\" 57 min: You'd have thought Rangers would have their tails up after the start to the second half they enjoyed, but since the dust from the goal settled, Bolton have been seeing more of the ball. There's not much going on, though. 59 min: A determined burst down the middle of the park by Diakite, who slides a pass down the inside-left for Cisse. The striker gets a low shot on target, but it's weak and straight at Bogdan. Still, nice move by QPR, and one that opened the hosts up a wee bit. 60 min: Ricketts romps down the left, drops a shoulder to skate past Barton on the inside, and attempts a curler into the top right. It's not a bad effort, but just a tad overcooked. The ball sails into the stand. 61 min: Onuoha slides in on Petrov down the left, near the corner flag as the Bolton midfielder was shaping to cross. That's as clear a booking as you'll see. 64 min: A corner for Bolton down the right. Miyaichi swings a low ball to the edge of the area, allowing Wheater to hack over. \"Don't listen to Mat Balco (51 min),\" advises Paul Gordon. \"I think you should talk about Andy Carroll more. Do you think he should shave before games? I do.\" I'd like to think we can all still be friends, and maybe Mat Balco will email in with his opinion on this pressing matter. 65 min: The populist mandarins of the FA never miss a trick, and already they've released a statement calling for goal-line technology to be introduced \"as soon as possible\". The world of football should listen, and listen good: somebody's had to put down their G&amp;T to knock that kneejerk press release out. 68 min: QPR are coming back into this. A ball's swung into the box from the right, Cisse nearly getting his head to it. Wheater climbs to head behind. The corner's wasted, but Rangers are soon coming back at the home side, Barton swinging another ball in from the same flank. Steinsson panics and, under no pressure whatsoever, heads behind for another corner. Rangers prove as wasteful from the left as they were from the right. But this is a decent response from Rangers, who suffered a quiet period since their goal. 71 min: A change for Bolton: Eagles comes on for Petrov. 73 min: Ricketts and Eagles combine tastily down the left, the former cutting in and being upended by QPR Man Whose Identity I Failed To Spot. Whatever, that's a free kick to Bolton, just to the left of the D. Eagles looks for the top left corner, but batters the ball straight into the wall. Not great. 76 min: Cisse tears down the right and digs out a marvellous cross. Zamora nearly takes it down on the penalty spot, but he's got his back to goal, and trapping while thinking about turning is beyond him this time. \"When Gary Naylor (26 mins) refers to 'how the media chooses its heroes',\" begins Justin Horton, dissecting the last published work by this site's king of obsessive detail and general pedantry, \"should he not say 'how the media choose their heroes'? Isn't 'media' a plural, specifically the plural of 'medium'?\" The biter bit. 77 min: Pratley upends Onuoha near the Bolton area, just to the right of the D. A free kick, which Zamora wastes with a lame shot into the wall. Derry attempts to follow up with a shot of his own, but there's no point describing it, no point at all. 80 min: Cisse tries to Mark Hughes one home from eight yards, but his acrobatic effort fles high and wide. Then a plethora of changes. For QPR, a triple substitution: Traore, Wright-Phillips and Derry off, Taiwo, Mackie and Buzsaky on. For Bolton, just the one: Pratley off, Klasnic on. 81 min: A pinball session in the Bolton area. QPR have about 20 shots at goal, to the tune of Yakety Sax by Boots Randolph. Eventually the ball drops to Mackie, six yards out. The ball balloons off Wheater's sprawling frame and away. For a second, QPR claim hand ball, but it's come off the defender's noggin. What a chance. 84 min: Diakite is booked for some incident or other missed by your hapless MBM scribe. Given that he should have seen yellow in the first half, he's a lucky chap to still be on the pitch. \"I don't know about shaving,\" writes Mac Millings, \"but I think Mat Balco's Andy Carroll should wax his legs. Gary Lineker did, and he scored loads of goals. Just look at the shine on those thighs!\" 86 min: GOAL! Bolton Wanderers 2-1 Queens Park Rangers. This is a wonderful goal, made by the excellent Miyaichi, who brings the ball down with his back to goal on the edge of the D, takes a couple of touches, and flicks a pass round the corner and down the inside-left channel for the sub Klasnic, who finds the bottom-right corner. That could seal a crucial win for Bolton, and really sink Rangers into the mire. 89 min: Rangers respond by streaming down the right through Cisse. There's a corner, but Bolton manage to deal with it, shuttle thte ball from danger, and win a free kick on the halfway line. Rangers look pained. Bolton replace Ngog with Muamba. Meanwhile, Millings is back: \"According to dictionary.com, 'media' may be used as Gary Naylor used it - that is, as a collective noun with a singular verb. Much like 'Gary Naylor' is a collective noun, meaning 'shadow group of sport-obsessed netgimps who publish their crazed musings on an unprecedentedly large scale, all under a single pseudonym'.\" He's all too real, Millings. He's all too real. 90 min: There will be four added minutes of this, and most of them will be played out in the Bolton half, I'll be bound. They're clearly sitting tight with what they've got, and who can blame them? 90 min +1: Eagles heads the ball against his own arm in the penalty area. Then Reo Coker lunges in on Onuoha, who is flipped into the air. Rangers claim a penalty both times, but they're not going to get one. Mark Hughes' press conference is going to be quite the event. 90 min +2: On the touchline, Mark Hughes is doing some hopping. 90 min +3: A free kick hoisted into the Bolton area. Bogdan just about punches it clear. It nearly falls to Mackie, who can't wrap his foot around the ball. The danger's cleared. FULL TIME: Bolton Wanderers 2-1 Queens Park Rangers. And that's that! A moment of crisp skill by Miyaichi has won the game for Bolton, who are out of the bottom three and a point above Rangers. QPR will rightly be livid at the Hill Incident, but then again their goal was clearly offside, so what goes round, etc., and so on. Still, that would have been the opener, and would have changed everything. You might also hear about that penalty shout at the end, too. Mark Hughes at least manages to shake Owen Coyle's hand, though, which is nice.",

      "body": "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>This is a must-win game for both sides.</strong> Let's riff on QPR's pain first. They're in desperate bother. Hovering over the relegation dotted line, in 16th spot, six goals less useless than 18th-placed Wolves, they've only won one of their last 15 league games. Considering they've yet to play Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Sunderland, they're in a bit of a state.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>As for Bolton?</strong> They're below the line, in 19th place, two points behind QPR. But they're done with all of the big boys bar Tottenham now, and have a much, much easier run-in. Mind you, they've just lost four on the bounce, including defeats to supposedly easier opposition in Norwich and Wigan, so that favourable fixture list might not count for much.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>A must-win game for both sides, then.</strong> A relegation six-pointer, if you will. A winner-takes-all-the-points demotion brouhaha. Bolton may be the more confident, having won the opening game of the season against Rangers 4-0. But they are a shower, so maybe not. But QPR are a shambles, so maybe. I really have to finish this paragraph now.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 12.45pm.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Bolton Wanderers:</strong> Bogdan, Steinsson, Wheater, Ream, Ricketts, Reo-Coker, Mark Davies, Pratley, Miyaichi, Ngog, Petrov.<br>Subs: Jaaskelainen, Muamba, Eagles, Knight, Kevin Davies, Klasnic, Sordell.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Queens Park Rangers:</strong> Kenny, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Hill, Traore, Barton, Diakite, Derry, Wright-Phillips, Cisse, Zamora.<br>Subs: Cerny, Gabbidon, Bothroyd, Mackie, Buzsaky, Young, Taiwo.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Anyway, never mind this football. Let's concentrate on the real issues.</strong> \"What do you think is worse, a shower or a shambles?\" asks philosophy's Patrick Cullen. \"At first I thought shambles, because you know a shower is temporary, the sun will shine again, and after all, it's only a shower, not a deluge or a monsoon. But then I thought about how a shambles just has to pull itself together to improve, something it can do from the one moment to the next, and not necessarily dependent on the rain stopping and the shower going away.\" Surely much depends on what the shower consists of. And its temperature. And whether it's being hosed straight between your eyes.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>The teams are out!</strong> Bolton are in their trademark dreadfully designed white shirts, QPR are in salmon pink. Or is it orange? Not sure. And don't care. \"I'm sure the idea of promotion/relegation for two years rather than one year has been kicked around before but I've missed said discussion,\" says Paul Taylor, of a subject that's news to me. \"Can a promoted club really make much progress financially (and on the pitch) playing for only one year in the big leagues?\" For the love of God, please be quiet, Paul. Someone from the SPL might be reading this, and you'll be giving them ideas.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Mark Hughes hasn't had a honeymoon period yet, the poor love. Could this be the start of something beautiful? His charges get the ball rolling, and hoick it straight out of play down the left, an agricultural hoof. The last live football match on British television was the Athletic Bilbao Show on Thursday evening. Compare and contrast. Best league in the world!</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Ricketts gets busy down the left and wins a corner for Bolton. The first is wasted, but QPR put the ball behind again and it's another corner, giving Bolton the opportunity to waste another set piece.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> From deep, Derry quarterbacks a pass down the left for Cisse, who isn't far from latching onto the ball. QPR have obviously decided to keep it basic this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> A lot of hoofing. It's a poor show so far, but let's give it a chance. \"As a shambles historically means a butcher's slaughterhouse then I'd guess that would be a worse thing to be, and frankly rather gruesome,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst. \"Not sure there is much way back for a team that have been turned into mince, sausages and chops. A shower could even be a good thing if it is a power shower, or discombobulating if it is a biblical shower like a shower of frogs.\" I suppose if you turn a poorly performing football squad into chops and sausages, you could at least recoup some of the cash wasted on the players by raffling a few trays off in the drinker on Sunday afternoon. Actually, Liverpool may want to consider this as a solution to the Carroll problem.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Pratley chases a ball down the inside-right channel and reaches it, plum on the byline, a few feet to the right of the QPR goal. He cuts an inviting ball back into the centre, but there's no Bolton player rushing in to take advantage.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> A free kick to Bolton down the right. Wanderers load the box. Petrov swings a useless ball in, allowing first man Barton to clear.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Miyaichi rolls the ball inside from the right to Ngog. Then a nice bit of skill by the striker, who dinks a first-time ball past Hill down the inside-right channel, and runs after it himself, clear into the area. But that's the sum total of the excellence, as his subsequent shot is snatched miles wide left. That was Torresesque.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> QPR aren't doing much at all. Cisse tries to make something happen down the right, chasing after a long ball, but can only slice a cross deep into the stand. He was never in control of that.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Miyaichi is looking lively down the Bolton right. He scampers into space and sees his cross hacked out for a corner. Miyaichi takes it himself. Wheater, from the penalty spot, aims a header towards the top right, but Ferdinand heads off the line and over for another corner. Which is wasted. But Bolton are beginning to look dangerous here.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> And yet it's nearly QPR who take the lead, Wright-Phillips diddling down the inside-left channel, the ball eventually breaking infield, settling on the edge of the area for Barton, who's cutting in from the right. He takes a whack at goal, and the ball's deflected, wrongfooting Bogdan in the Bolton goal. Luckily for the home side, the ball flies wide right, and the subsequent corner is a joke.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Cisse, from the edge of the D, dinks a ball down the inside-left channel for Zamora, who <em>smashes</em> a shot from a tight angle off the crossbar and away. That's a wonderful effort. Rangers were not far short of appalling during the opening exchanges, but have suddenly woken up.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>20 min: OUTRAGEOUS REFEREEING DECISION! QPR ROBBED!</strong> A corner for QPR down the left, after Cisse causes some bother in the box. It's swung into the Bolton six-yard box. Hill, coming in at the near post, stoops and powers a header over the line. Bogdan claws it out, in the Roy Carroll style; it's <em>miles</em> behind the line. But the linesman doesn't give the goal. That is a preposterous decision. QPR have the funk on, and no bloody wonder.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> On the touchline, Mark Hughes is waving his arms around, mouthing words such as EFF and CEE.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Pratley hacks Diakite, a late slide. He's booked, and can have no complaints. The linesman central to the Hill Incident is, for the record, called Bob Pollock. The visiting Londoners, fond as they are of chatting in rhyme, will be in no doubt as to what said official has just dropped.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Pratley comes inside from the right and has a dig. The ball balloons off Hill and nearly finds the top left. It's only a corner, which is a complete waste of time. \"Now Steve Bruce has gone, are Owen Coyle and Mark Hughes the managers with the highest reputations and the fewest acheivements in the Premier League? I don't know how the media chooses its heroes and villains, but once in one camp, it seems to take a lot of shifting to end up in the other,\" writes Gary Naylor, of a phenomenon known as the Hodgson Law of Honour, or Roy's Rules of Renown.</p> <!-- Block 25 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387176622\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2012/3/10/1331385013732/Clint-Hills-header--003.jpg\" alt=\"Clint Hill's header \" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clint Hill's header crosses the line but the referee and his assistants fail to spot it and no goal is awarded. Photograph: Screengrab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>29 min:</strong> That incident has taken quite a bit of wind from QPR's sails. And no wonder. Will you just look at that!</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Wheater is booked for a tug on Cisse. \"Surely Andy Carroll would be sent to the knacker's yard to be boiled down for glue?\" asks Dennis Johns. \"Like poor old Boxer in Animal Farm, though Terry and Drogba are more the Napoleon and Snowball types. I'll put this analogy down now.\" Boxer was quite a willing worker, though, wasn't he?</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> A free kick for Bolton, 35 yards out, just to the right of goal. The home side load the box. Petrov can't beat the first man. The ball's cleared. Miyaichi looks to cushion it on his thigh and Le Tissier a volley goalwards, but Cisse nicks the ball from him and looks to break. Before losing control with options on either side and Bolton light at the back. This is a poor game on the whole.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Ngog rather saucily goes to ground in the box as he looks to turn Hill and get a shot away. It's not a penalty, and Hill isn't slow in telling the striker that, in the full and frank manner. That would have put the tin lid on Hill's half.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Diakite, sent off after 0.000000000004 seconds on his debut, is lucky to escape a booking for a ludicrous lunge on Steinsson. Free kick down the right for Bolton. From which...</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>37 min: GOAL! Bolton Wanderers 1-0 QPR.</strong> The free kick is worked right to left across the face of the QPR box. Finally, Petrov is sprung clear down the left. He stands the ball up into the centre, where Pratley powers a header home into the right-hand side of the net. Rangers, who should have been ahead, are now behind, and wearing the look of men about to sail the funk mothership into the heart of a blistering sun.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Wright Phillips has a chance to immediately level, with the ball in plenty of space down the inside-left channel, but his curler towards the top-right corner is all wrong. It flies miles wide right and high of goal.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Mark Davies and Onuoha come together down the right. A fair 50-50 challenge, but Davies has come off the worst. A stoppage. \"Grinding up a rubbish team for meat?\" splutters Mac Millings. \"Solving the Carroll problem? I can almost hear Charlton Heston now. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sp-VFBbjpE\">'Pointless Team is people!'</a>\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Stoppage over. Davies back up and running. \"This is a horrible advert for Premiership football,\" opines Alex Bishop. \"Everything about this game; the scrappy passing, poor finishing, bad refereeing, the half empty ground and that bloody song they played when Bolton scored!\" We're enjoying ourselves, aren't we.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> QPR ping pretty triangles down the inside-right channel, Zamora and Cisse the skillsters. Eventually the ball's pinged to Onuoha, bombing down the right. He hammers it low and hard towards the Bolton net, but Bogdan hacks away with his feet. For the record, the ball was a few yards in front of the line.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Bolton Wanderers 1-0 Queens Park Rangers.</strong> And after a couple of minutes of added time, that is that. Hill wanders off shaking his head, the Rangers fans booing and chanting \"You don't know what you're doing\" to Mr Pollock. This could be an interesting second half if QPR come back out with the rage.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>HALF-TIME ADVERTISEMENT starring man with similar demeanour to, and cheery outlook on life as, Mark Hughes:</strong></p> <!-- Block 37 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGr5y2tNoqM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGr5y2tNoqM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>\"It is not eggs, it is eels.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> No changes to either side. Bolton get the ball rolling for the second half. Sky have pointed out that Bolton may be cashing in some karma today, given that an over-the-line misjudgement by the referee against Everton effectively relegated them (and not Everton) back in 1997. Like QPR will care about that. Still, Bolton were due one I suppose, and QPR have one hell of a slice of luck coming to them in 2027.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>48 min: GOAL! Bolton Wanderers 1-1 Queens Park Rangers.</strong> Diakite dinks a ball straight down the middle of the park to release Cisse, who slides the ball under Bogdan and home. That's so simple. And a good yard or two offside. Well, that's levelled things up.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Now it's Bolton's turn to wander about stunned. That shock at the start of the half has knocked them back on their heels. QPR aren't doing much at the moment either, but will be feeling mighty fine about themselves at the moment. \"You have a two-yard ghost goal in a crucial relegation match and all you can talk about is Andy Carroll??\" blasts a red-faced Mat Balco, barely able to focus on his computer screen, the light refracting through the hot salty tears. \"WTF?? Seriously?? Honestly pathetic.\" Sorry, Mat, that I've only so far mentioned it in the 22nd, 23rd, 29th, 35th and 45th minutes, in the descriptions of both goals, and the restart to the second half. And posted a picture of it. Just so I know next time, and in the interests of Open Journalism, what else did you want me to do? I live to dance little jigs.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Bolton are slowly recovering. Mark Davies is putting himself about, probing down both channels. QPR certainly don't look certain at the back, but that's hardly news. \"Hancock's wrong,\" writes Paul Gordon. \"It's eggs.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> You'd have thought Rangers would have their tails up after the start to the second half they enjoyed, but since the dust from the goal settled, Bolton have been seeing more of the ball. There's not much going on, though.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> A determined burst down the middle of the park by Diakite, who slides a pass down the inside-left for Cisse. The striker gets a low shot on target, but it's weak and straight at Bogdan. Still, nice move by QPR, and one that opened the hosts up a wee bit.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Ricketts romps down the left, drops a shoulder to skate past Barton on the inside, and attempts a curler into the top right. It's not a bad effort, but just a tad overcooked. The ball sails into the stand.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Onuoha slides in on Petrov down the left, near the corner flag as the Bolton midfielder was shaping to cross. That's as clear a booking as you'll see.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> A corner for Bolton down the right. Miyaichi swings a low ball to the edge of the area, allowing Wheater to hack over. \"Don't listen to Mat Balco (51 min),\" advises Paul Gordon. \"I think you should talk about Andy Carroll more. Do you think he should shave before games? I do.\" I'd like to think we can all still be friends, and maybe Mat Balco will email in with his opinion on this pressing matter.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> The populist mandarins of the FA never miss a trick, and already they've released a statement calling for goal-line technology to be introduced \"as soon as possible\". The world of football should listen, and listen good: somebody's had to put down their G&amp;T to knock that kneejerk press release out.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> QPR are coming back into this. A ball's swung into the box from the right, Cisse nearly getting his head to it. Wheater climbs to head behind. The corner's wasted, but Rangers are soon coming back at the home side, Barton swinging another ball in from the same flank. Steinsson panics and, under no pressure whatsoever, heads behind for another corner. Rangers prove as wasteful from the left as they were from the right. But this is a decent response from Rangers, who suffered a quiet period since their goal.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> A change for Bolton: Eagles comes on for Petrov.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Ricketts and Eagles combine tastily down the left, the former cutting in and being upended by QPR Man Whose Identity I Failed To Spot. Whatever, that's a free kick to Bolton, just to the left of the D. Eagles looks for the top left corner, but batters the ball straight into the wall. Not great.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Cisse tears down the right and digs out a marvellous cross. Zamora nearly takes it down on the penalty spot, but he's got his back to goal, and trapping while thinking about turning is beyond him this time. \"When Gary Naylor (26 mins) refers to 'how the media chooses its heroes',\" begins Justin Horton, dissecting the last published work by this site's king of obsessive detail and general pedantry, \"should he not say 'how the media choose their heroes'?

Then a plethora of changes. For QPR, a triple substitution: Traore, Wright-Phillips and Derry off, Taiwo, Mackie and Buzsaky on. For Bolton, just the one: Pratley off, Klasnic on.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> A pinball session in the Bolton area. QPR have about 20 shots at goal, to the tune of Yakety Sax by Boots Randolph. Eventually the ball drops to Mackie, six yards out. The ball balloons off Wheater's sprawling frame and away. For a second, QPR claim hand ball, but it's come off the defender's noggin. What a chance.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Diakite is booked for some incident or other missed by your hapless MBM scribe. Given that he should have seen yellow in the first half, he's a lucky chap to still be on the pitch. \"I don't know about shaving,\" writes Mac Millings, \"but I think Mat Balco's Andy Carroll should wax his legs.

      "bodyText": "The sad news of kidnapped engineer Chris McManus's death in Nigeria is a stark reminder of just how dangerous engineering in conflict zones can be. Working for a humanitarian organisation that was founded to send engineers to help in major natural disasters, I know only too well that the risks facing people like Chris are on the rise \u2013 in places like Nigeria,but also in many other parts of Africa, Asia and further afield. In fact, threats to expatriates and locals working in difficult and dangerous locations \u2013 whether commercial engineers or aid workers, doctors or security contractors \u2013 are now more common than in any period I can remember in the past 30 years. Just a quick survey of people I know, who have worked in all manner of conflict zones in recent years, throws up more than a couple of examples. One, an engineer on contract in Albania recalls having an AK-47 thrust into his face while trying to find a location to install water tanks. Another reports driving through the middle of a firefight in Burundi after he and an engineer friend found themselves in an impromptu battle for the control of a road. A third spent time last year negotiating a colleague's release after he was abducted in Somalia. And further examples abound \u2013 just take the British and American engineers who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 or the British engineers who went to Chechnya to repair telecommunications in the late nineties, only to be kidnapped and later beheaded. So why are engineers \u2013 whether commercial or humanitarian \u2013 at particular and increasing risk? The reasons are many. In the case of somewhere like northern Nigeria, where Chris McManus was working, skilled expatriates \u2013 in fact westerners in general \u2013 are both a potentially lucrative source of income for rebels and political groups in need of cash, and an effective PR tool. There is no better way for a group like Boko Haram to get their message across than via regular coverage of their cause in powerful global media. Politically, too, the sense of alienation from the West in many poverty-stricken regions is growing fast. And then there's the increased proliferation of weapons. But there are more practical reasons, too. Contractors like Kenneth Bigley and his two US colleagues who were killed in Iraq in 2004 while working on reconstruction projects, are a prime example of skilled workers who are brought into post-conflict regions to help rebuild. The very nature of reconstructing towns, bridges and infrastructure often means engineers are required to travel, sometimes to very insecure areas. And, they are almost always in a hands-on role, working out in remote locations usually with limited if any communications coverage. More so than perhaps other professions, and by the very nature of their work, they are put in harms way. It's a stark fact that for humanitarian workers operating in hostile environments \u2013 and it's undoubtedly the same for expatriate staff across the board \u2013 the most dangerous place to be is on the road. When you're travelling you are incredibly vulnerable. So what's the answer? There is no silver bullet. Though threats will always remain, the mitigation of security risks is absolutely critical. Effective hostile environment and security training is just one of the many precautions we insist on before sending engineers, or any of our staff, to dangerous locations. Or, there's not going at all. But with high wages for those willing to put up with the security risk in Nigeria, Iraq or Afghanistan, it seems unlikely the steady flow of skilled staff to conflict zones will stop anytime soon. One thing is certain: with the increasing incidence of legal action \u2013 namely expatriate workers suing their companies and organisations when they experience traumatic events such as kidnap \u2013 companies, charities and contractors simply cannot afford to turn a blind eye. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

      "bodyText": "The SNP leader, Alex Salmond, has urged Scots to embrace independence in his speech to his party's spring conference, telling voters they face a stark choice between \"home rule\" and \"Tory rule from Westminster\". Scotland's first minister focused his speech on building support for ending the union as well as launching the nationalists' local government election campaign. His address comes after delegates unanimously passed a motion committing to the quickest possible timetable for removal of Trident nuclear weapons from Scottish waters. Scottish voters go to the polls to elect their councillors on 3 May, and the SNP has set a key target of winning control of Scotland's biggest council, Glasgow City, from Labour. Salmond said: \"With the people of Scotland in charge, speaking with our own voice, reflecting our own values and priorities, we will make our country better. This is our message of hope.\" He said he \"had a message for Messrs Cameron, Clegg and Miliband\" declaring \"the days of politicians in London telling Scotland what to do and what to think are over\". The SNP government wants to see an independence referendum held in autumn 2014 and is currently gathering views through a public consultation. The first minister also set out a new plan to help out-of-work young people, saying: \"I can announce a \u00a35m package which will ensure a further 2,500 young people are given the right support to help them towards the world of work. \"This will engage young people in volunteering opportunities in the international and national events Scotland have the privilege to host over the next three years.\" The two-day conference takes place less than a year after the SNP secured an unprecedented overall majority at Holyrood.",

      "bodyText": "Giles Fraser reflected after the eviction of Occupy from St Paul's that \"Occupy is stubbornly about the physical reality of space. Others may write books and organise seminars. Occupy puts up tents. It takes up space. It is there. Except of course now it is not.\" Giles's reflections struck me as romantic and grounded in an imaginary idea rather than the reality of the 99%. The experience of at least some of us living alongside Occupy Exeter, who chose to occupy the Cathedral Green, was rooted in a reality that was both messy and incoherent. Cathedrals bear witness to an engagement with an Occupy movement that began with the birth of a refugee threatened by a monstrous regime. The 99% in first-century Palestine stood very little chance of finding a voice. The birth of Jesus Christ interrupted 400 rather silent years as far as prophetic voices speaking up for the poor and marginalised were concerned. Religious people had grown accustomed to not seeing the miraculous, so their faith had grown stale. Often, people missed out on more because they simply had closed their minds off to the possibility of God intervening in their lives. Rome ruled. Poverty and day-to-day survival were the norm. How do you maintain a witness to something that you think is of vital importance \u2013 shall we say to the eternal dimensions of life \u2013 in the midst of an environment that seems hostile? I suspect that question is a key one for the Occupy movement. They press certain questions about the ordering of society upon us in a counter-cultural way. The questions they raise about the ordering of society are questions that Christians have been raising since that intervention in a hostile society in first-century Palestine. Yet those of us who engaged with the Occupy movement felt a weight of expectations that could never be met. We put it to the Occupiers that our strategy \u2013 together \u2013 had to be about turning expectations to invitations. Rather than simply occupying a physical space as if there is a moral right to just do what you want, isn't it better to make a protest but at the same time invite people to engage their hearts and minds in a series of conversations that open up the landscape rather than occupy it? But there was little or no willingness on behalf of Occupy to co-operate. It was their way or the highway \u2013 or, as it turned out, blockage of the highway. There is still an opportunity to make the best and most of Occupy if there can be a joint invitation, spoken into an environment that is hostile to the deep questions of both faith and order in a more just society. The invitation is to see that faith and the ordering of our common life needs to be addressed differently for the good of all \u2013 not just the one or 99%. I don't know whether our experience at Exeter was the same at each of the Occupy camps situated by cathedrals; that it is not easy to make that invitation jointly when we ourselves feel occupied. When we felt invaded rather than invited. The truth is that there already was and is an Occupy Exeter movement on the green. It is the cathedral, the community that forms around it and the residential community housed in the close. Occupy Exeter chose to invade that community in a destructive way, to the detriment of the health of at least some of those living in the close. They conveniently chose to ignore that fact every time it was put to them. The whole of the Occupy movement seems to be ruled by the very things they wanted to deny in those whose lives they ignored \u2013 feelings. They seemed to believe that their own feelings were more important and trumped anyone else's. While they trumpeted proudly the mantra of \"nonviolent direct action\", and \"peaceful protest\", they refused to see that the cathedral and those involved in its life did not receive it in that way. It felt like violence towards the things we stood for and care for and had responsibility for. What Occupy did was far from peaceful, was violent towards us and did not lead to peace. Fraser probably got out too soon to engage with the feelings that emerged as time went on. Cathedrals take up space, physically, spiritually and emotionally. To pretend that there is no emotional component to a cathedral, as Occupy and Fraser seem to do, is to miss a vital link in the chain of the 99%. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

The experience of at least some of us living alongside <a href=\"http://occupyexeter.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">Occupy Exeter</a>, who chose to occupy the Cathedral Green, was rooted in a reality that was both messy and incoherent.</p> <p>Cathedrals bear witness to an engagement with an Occupy movement that began with the birth of a refugee threatened by a monstrous regime. The 99% in first-century Palestine stood very little chance of finding a voice. The birth of Jesus Christ interrupted 400 rather silent years as far as prophetic voices speaking up for the poor and marginalised were concerned. Religious people had grown accustomed to not seeing the miraculous, so their faith had grown stale. Often, people missed out on more because they simply had closed their minds off to the possibility of God intervening in their lives. Rome ruled.

      "bodyText": "The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has held talks with Kofi Annan and told him that no political solution was possible in Syria while \"terrorist\" groups were destabilising the country. Assad said Syria was willing to make \"any honest effort\" to find a solution but added that diplomatic progress was not possible while armed rebels were \"operating and spreading chaos\". Annan met Assad in Damascus to press for a political solution to end the bloodshed in Syria. The two men spoke for two hours at the presidential palace as Syrian opposition leaders denounced the talks, claiming that any deal with Assad was unthinkable while civilians were being killed by government forces. The talks, described as \"positive\" by the state-run Sana news agency, came as Syrian troops pushed ahead with a new assault on the northern region of Idlib, shelling one of the centres of the uprising against Assad's rule. Opposition activists said at least 26 people were killed across Syria on Friday, but there were also signs of more cracks in the Assad regime. A Turkish official said two Syrian generals, a colonel and two sergeants had defected to Turkey on Thursday, soon after Syria's deputy oil minister, Abdo Hussameldin, and a brigadier general announced their desertion of the regime on YouTube. Western diplomats speculated on Friday that the public nature of their renunciation of the Assad government had encouraged other high-ranking officers to follow their example. The new defectors were among 234 Syrians who have crossed into Turkey since Thursday. The defections were welcomed by EU foreign ministers meeting in Copenhagen, where they were portrayed as a sign that sanctions against the Damascus government were working. \"It is very good news that clearly high-ranking state and military officials are increasingly turning away from the Assad regime,\" said Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, speaking in Berlin before his departure for the Danish capital. \"The process of disintegration of the Assad regime has begun; the signs of erosion will continue. No country can be led in the long term with cruelty and repression.\" Meanwhile, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said his government was not protecting Assad's regime but the international community should not blame only one side for the violence. Speaking in Cairo at an Arab League meeting, Lavrov said the immediate mission was to halt violence and enable humanitarian assistance to reach those in need. The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, told Lavrov that rebels fighting Assad should not be labelled \"armed gangs\" but were defending themselves from systematic killing by the Syrian authorities. He said a ceasefire was not enough, insisting that those responsible for the violence should be held to account and prisoners freed. Saudi Arabia called on Russia to back the Arab League effort to end the violence. Russia, a close ally of Syria, angered many Arab governments last month by vetoing a draft UN resolution that would have put pressure on Assad to step down. Ahead of Saturday's meeting in Damascus, Annan, a former UN secretary general who has been appointed joint UN-Arab League envoy, said he was taking \"realistic\" proposals to halt the killing, but did not go into details. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said on Friday that Annan's priority was to immediately halt all fighting by government forces and opposition fighters, simultaneously if possible. Ban said a ceasefire should be quickly followed by inclusive political talks to resolve the year-long conflict. Burhan Ghalioun, the leader of the main opposition group, the Syrian National Council, said any talks with Assad were pointless as long as the regime continued to massacre its own people. \"It feels like we are watching the same movie being repeated over and over again,\" Ghalioun told the Associated Press in an interview from Paris. \"My fear is that, like other international envoys before him, the aim is to waste a month or two of pointless mediation efforts.\" In Beijing, China announced on Friday that it was sending its own envoy to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and France to explain its proposal for a Syrian ceasefire. The foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said the assistant foreign affairs minister, Zhang Ming, would meet Arab League leaders during the seven-day trip, which begins on Sunday. The conflict in Syria is now one of the bloodiest of the Arab spring, with the UN saying more than 7,500 people have been killed. Activists put the number at more than 8,000.",

Saudi Arabia called on Russia to back the Arab League effort to end the violence.</p> <p>Russia, a close ally of Syria, angered many Arab governments last month by vetoing a draft UN resolution that would have put pressure on Assad to step down.</p> <p>Ahead of Saturday's meeting in Damascus, Annan, a former UN secretary general who has been appointed joint UN-Arab League envoy, said he was taking \"realistic\" proposals to halt the killing, but did not go into details.</p> <p>The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said on Friday that Annan's priority was to immediately halt all fighting by government forces and opposition fighters, simultaneously if possible.</p> <p>Ban said a ceasefire should be quickly followed by inclusive political talks to resolve the year-long conflict.</p> <p>Burhan Ghalioun, the leader of the main opposition group, the Syrian National Council, said any talks with Assad were pointless as long as the regime continued to massacre its own people.</p> <p>\"It feels like we are watching the same movie being repeated over and over again,\" Ghalioun told the Associated Press in an interview from Paris. \"My fear is that, like other international envoys before him, the aim is to waste a month or two of pointless mediation efforts.\"</p> <p>In Beijing, China announced on Friday that it was sending its own envoy to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and France to explain its proposal for a Syrian ceasefire. The foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said the assistant foreign affairs minister, Zhang Ming, would meet Arab League leaders during the seven-day trip, which begins on Sunday.</p> <p>The conflict in Syria is now one of the bloodiest of the Arab spring, with the UN saying more than 7,500 people have been killed. Activists put the number at more than 8,000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two hostages \u2013 one British and one Italian \u2013 killed during a failed rescue attempt in Nigeria were taken to a toilet and shot dead as special forces tried to free them, a witness has said. The wife of one of the men guarding the victims described the executions amid an escalating diplomatic row between Italy and Britain over the unsuccessful rescue mission. Italian officials, including the country's president, have said it is inexplicable that Britain did not inform its European partner before launching the attempt to free the two construction workers. Chris McManus and Italian Franco Lamolinara were kidnapped last May while working in north-west Nigeria and killed on 8 March. The guard's wife \u2013 who gave her name as Hauwa \u2013 said bullets flew into the room where she and her husband were staying at the time of the rescue bid, killing her husband. \"After that, there were about six men who came out of the house with the two hostages,\" she said. \"They came into our wing of the compound, pushed the captives into the toilet and just shot them. I screamed.\" She denied knowing the hostages had been living in the same compound as her and said they had been kept in the main house which she was strictly forbidden to enter. Nigerian authorities have detained five Islamist militants suspected of involvement in the kidnapping. Two of the men were arrested before the rescue attempt and three at the compound where the raid took place. Italy's foreign minister, Giulio Terzi, has asked Britain to provide the \"utmost clarity\" around the events, and demanded details urgently. William Hague, the British foreign secretary, said the limited time available to make a decision \"constrained how much we were able to consult others\". But Downing Street has insisted that a possible rescue attempt had been raised with the Italian government beforehand and no objections were raised. McManus, 28, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, and Lamolinara are believed to have been kidnapped by a faction of the militant Islamist sect Boko Haram. The Italian and British governments tried to play down tensions on Friday in a joint statement issued after a meeting between Hague and Terzi. Hague had \"made clear that there had been a limited opportunity to secure the release of the two hostages, whose lives were in imminent and growing danger\", they said. The statement added: \"Under these circumstances it was only possible to inform Italy once the operation was under way. \"Mr Terzi expressed deep sorrow and disappointment over the tragic outcome of the operation and both ministers agreed on the urgency of sharing full information to facilitate the reconstruction and understanding of these events. \"Both ministers conveyed their solidarity and sympathy for the families of Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara.\" Nigerian and British forces are reported to have fought for at least an hour in daylight after capturing a gang member who told them the hostages were being held in a disused house in Sokoto, north-west Nigeria. British government officials in Nigeria then asked for immediate permission to launch a raid because of fears that the hostage-takers had discovered that their whereabouts were known to the authorities, sources said. British special forces mounted the rescue attempt as soon as intelligence revealed where the two hostages were being held and \u2013 crucially \u2013 that the hostages were about to be moved, senior Whitehall officials briefed on the operation said on Friday night. \"It was not a matter of if they were going to be killed but when,\" said one official, reflecting a unapologetic mood within Whitehall about the decision. Nevertheless, British and Nigerian intelligence agencies and special forces are under pressure to explain exactly what went wrong and why \u2013 not least to the angry Italians. In the UK, senior ministers will be demanding a full debriefing on the incident.",

Twenty-five militants were killed in Bayda, about 166 miles south-east of the capital, Sana'a, on Friday, while 20 died at a base in the restive southern town of Jaar, residents told Reuters on Saturday. Jaar, the second-largest town in Abyan province, was seized by militants last March as protests against the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, gripped the country. Residents of Bayda said fighter planes had raided the western outskirts of the town where Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law) militants \u2013 who have been fighting Yemen's security forces since mid-2011 \u2013 were based. \"Flames and smoke could be seen rising from the area,\" one Bayda resident said. Ansar al-Sharia is inspired by al-Qaida, but the precise nature of its ties to the global network are unclear. The Yemeni government claims they are one and the same. Al-Arabiya television reported that Friday's raid in Bayda was believed to have been carried out by US planes. In a separate incident, a local security official said two al-Qaida militants were killed on Friday as they tried to set off a bomb at a security checkpoint at an entry point to the town of Mudiyah, in Abyan. Working with the Yemeni authorities, the US has repeatedly used drones to attack militants from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, warned that Yemen was facing a new wave of internal displacement as tens of thousands of civilians flee tribal clashes in the north and fighting between the government and militants in the south. It said that, in the past two weeks alone, 1,800 people had been displaced by the latest escalation in fighting between government troops and militants in the Abyan governorate.",

      "bodyText": "Up to 20,000 demonstrators have gathered in central Moscow to demand Vladimir Putin's resignation and protest against electoral fraud. The rally is being widely seen as a test of whether the opposition is able to maintain its strength after Putin won a return to the Kremlin on Sunday amid global accusations of vote-rigging. Putin took 64% of the vote, according to official figures, and is set to stay in the Kremlin for the next six years. Organisers had hoped at least 50,000 people would turn out for the protest on New Arbat, one of Moscow's main streets, but independent witnesses estimated the crowd to be around 20,000. The rally was approved by the city authorities and police were out in force, with at least two helicopters hovering overhead. Protest leaders addressed the crowd from a stage bearing the slogans \"For new elections\" and \"These are not elections, this is not a president\". \"These authorities are illegitimate,\" Vladimir Ryzhkov, an opposition leader and protest organiser, told the crowd. Protesters, in bright sunshine, waved flags, balloons and banners and wore white ribbons, the symbol of protests that began three months ago. Although anger at Putin's re-election remains high \u2013 international observers said the vote was marred by fraud and a lack of competition \u2013 there is recognition among protest leaders that the movement must grow beyond public rallies in its bid to challenge Russia's political system. Putin won almost two-thirds of the vote across the country but failed to break the 50% barrier in Moscow. Alexey Navalny, a popular opposition leader, has spoken of creating a \"universal propaganda machine\" to break the hold of state-run television in provincial Russia. \"Now is the time for long-term goals,\" Yevgeniya Chirikova, an opposition leader who came to prominence after fighting against the building of a road through Moscow's only oak forest, said. \"More than anything, we must go out and meet people, bring the truth to them and explain what is going on.\" \"Our task now is to help people realise that civil society work must be like their regular work.

Alexey Navalny, a popular opposition leader, has spoken of creating a \"universal propaganda machine\" to break the hold of state-run television in provincial Russia.</p> <p>\"Now is the time for long-term goals,\" Yevgeniya Chirikova, an opposition leader who came to prominence after fighting against the building of a road through Moscow's only oak forest, said.</p> <p>\"More than anything, we must go out and meet people, bring the truth to them and explain what is going on.\"</p> <p>\"Our task now is to help people realise that civil society work must be like their regular work.

Here's a scenario to consider\u2026 what would you do if\u2026 A new teacher colleague (who has become your best friend on the staff), tells you in strictest confidence that she has started a relationship with another newly qualified teacher in the school\u2026? (So what\u2026 most people meet their partners at work don't they...?)

She pleads for your discretion and admits she has been drinking heavily to cope with the stress of her elderly mother becoming terminally ill and needing full time care at home. How would you respond\u2026? One day you walk in to an office you think is vacant.

You talk to the head about it\u2026 The head breaks down and admits that she has used school money to pay for additional palliative care for her mother, now recently deceased. But the discrepancies in the accounts are the result of her paying the money back into school funds. The sums are thousands, but she says she has now re-paid every penny she \"borrowed\". What would you do\u2026? (Apply for another job? - because that's one hell of a school you're working in\u2026!) No. I'm joking. Seriously, I am very interested in what you would think, say and do in all of these very \"unprofessional\" but also very \"human\" situations. I suspect that if (and when) we really find ourselves in the midst of such dilemmas, our responses wouldn't be as straightforward as we'd like to think. One more thing\u2026 just in case you think all these scenarios are totally inconceivable and you'll never find yourself in such messy situations... these are all authentic examples from the disciplinary case history of teaching's professional regulatory body in England.

Politicians from the era of the deposed president Hosni Mubarak, ex-military officers and moderate and hardline Islamists are expected to become the frontrunners in a vote due to start on 23 May. The elections follow decades of authoritarian rule, with all of the country's former presidents elevated from the ranks of the military and usually approved by referendum. Mubarak, who was forced to step down last year after an 18-day mass uprising, was elected to his last term in 2005. Those were Egypt's first multi-candidate presidential elections but they were widely rigged. The country's ruling military council, which took power after Mubarak's fall, has pledged to transfer power to elected civilian authorities after the name of the new president is announced on 21 June. The revolutionary youth movement that led the uprising, a poor performer in the first post-revolution parliamentary elections in January, is concerned the generals will keep their grip on power even after a new president is inaugurated. Two of the top presidential hopefuls, the former Arab League chief Amr Moussa and the former prime minister Lieutenant General Ahmed Shafiq, have warm relations with the generals. Moussa, who has popularity among middle-class Egyptians, has made cautious statements that appear critical of a political role and privileges for the military, but is still considered a product of the Mubarak era. Shafiq is a former pilot in the armed forces who was forced to resign as prime minister last year because of alleged ties with Mubarak. Two other strong candidates, the ultraconservative Hazem Abu-Ismail and the moderate Islamist Abdel-Moneim Abolfotoh, have frostier relations with the military and are more likely to try to deprive the generals of a significant political role after a transition of power.",

      "bodyText": "This extract from The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial* is taken from a chapter written by Chris Atkins, director of a film that showed how tabloid journalists could be fooled into accepting false stories. His Starsuckers documentary, first screened in 2009, exposed the deceit involved in celebrity reporting. Some 30 minutes of the film was shown to the Leveson inquiry. Atkins begins his piece by explaining that there \"was abundant prima facie evidence of wrongdoing\" by tabloid journalists but the only way to prove it was by the use of subterfuge. His words follow... We set out to feed untrue stories to tabloid newspapers to see if they would be printed without checks, and observe how the stories were relayed to the public. We created fictional celebrity stories that had no factual basis whatsoever, apart from the physical location of a celebrity at a certain time. We avoided fabricating anything malicious or defamatory to the celebrity themselves, and did not take any of the money that was offered in return for the stories... Researching our first story, we learned that the Canadian singer, Avril Lavigne, had been to the nightclub Bungalow 8. The next morning, on 18 March 2009, our researcher Jen Richardson called the Daily Mirror news desk pretending to be French party girl 'Gigi', with the story that Lavigne had fallen asleep in Bungalow 8, and started snoring. Jen had spent a large amount of time (and expense) visiting celebrity nightclubs, and working on Gigi's character, in order to make her stories convincing. From this first call it was clear that this research was redundant \u2013 the journalist at the Daily Mirror simply wrote down what Jen said, and didn't probe further. Our fabricated story appeared in the newspaper the following day without checks. Jen was told to send in her bank details to receive the \u00a350 payment for the story, which we did not do. As the investigation continued we created more and more outlandish stories to see at what point suspicions would be raised. We went on to feed fabricated stories successfully to the Daily Star, the Daily Mirror again, The Sun and the Daily Express. As the tales became more absurd, the effect was not that they received more scrutiny, but that the payments offered increased along with the coverage... In all, six fake celebrity stories were created and fed to the tabloid press in a two-week period in March 2009.. Our biggest story was in The Sun, revealing that Sarah Harding from Girls Aloud was secretly a fan of Quantum Physics. It ran as a lead story in Gordon Smart's Bizarre column. Smart's article also included a fabricated quote: 'There is a lot more going on under that blonde barnet than Sarah is given credit for. She's a smart cookie and does read an awful lot.' This quote didn't come from Jen, showing that the Sun will add fictitious quotes into their articles, as well as not running basic checks. At the time, Girls Aloud appeared regularly in The Sun, so it would have taken minutes to check with the agent or PR if there was any truth to our story. The Harding physics story was then was picked up by dozens of news sites around the world. Had we claimed it, the story fee would have earned us \u00a3600 from News International... Later... we look at the culture of criminality in tabloid newspapers. We talked to several journalists and ex-journalists off the record who told us that the [Clive] Goodman and [Glenn] Mulcaire convictions were just the tip of the iceberg. These sources explained that tabloid journalists, from the Sunday papers in particular, were still routinely breaking the law to get stories without any public interest. Our research also indicated that this behaviour was institutionally ingrained in tabloid culture... We wanted to test the Sunday tabloids to see if their journalists were willing to break the law, and the PCC code, to obtain private information about celebrities that was not in the public interest. The scenario was constructed to present the newspapers with a story that would involve them breaking the rules, and see which newspapers would engage with us. I would pose as an intermediary who was selling the details of celebrities plastic surgery operations, but was ignorant of the rules of modern tabloid reporting. I would claim that I was the ex-boyfriend of a nurse who worked in a plastic surgery clinic and who had evidence of high profile celebrities having operations. Given the intrusive nature of such stories, the newspapers would be likely to need to obtain proof that these stories were true in order to print them. Any such proof would inherently involve a breach of the Data Protection Act, which prohibits the sale of medical records. Even harvesting information to research the stories would involve a breach of the DPA, as this would constitute a fishing expedition. The DPA does have a general opt-out for journalists where the information is in the public interest... So we deliberately created stories that, while of interest to a tabloid readership, could never be classed as being in the public interest... Atkins then details his conversations with four people from four news desks - the Sunday Express (which rejected the idea), News of the World, Sunday Mirror and the People. They showed varying degrees of interest. He concludes: To our knowledge, the PCC did not, in any way, investigate any of the allegations made by Starsuckers, even though three of the four newspapers we tested seemed willing to breach the PCC code and the DPA... I believe that Starsuckers shows that there are serious problems at the heart of the British media, in particular the tabloid press. These are problems that the media itself is incapable of investigating or solving, which is why I support stronger regulation of the press that is completely independent of both the press and government.

Some 30 minutes of the film was shown to the Leveson inquiry. </p> <p>Atkins begins his piece by explaining that there \"was abundant prima facie evidence of wrongdoing\" by tabloid journalists but the only way to prove it was by the use of subterfuge. His words follow...</p> <p>We set out to feed untrue stories to tabloid newspapers to see if they would be printed without checks, and observe how the stories were relayed to the public.</p> <p>We created fictional celebrity stories that had no factual basis whatsoever, apart from the physical location of a celebrity at a certain time. We avoided fabricating anything malicious or defamatory to the celebrity themselves, and did not take any of the money that was offered in return for the stories... </p> <p>Researching our first story, we learned that the Canadian singer, Avril Lavigne, had been to the nightclub Bungalow 8. </p> <p>The next morning, on 18 March 2009, our researcher Jen Richardson called the Daily Mirror news desk pretending to be French party girl 'Gigi', with the story that Lavigne had fallen asleep in Bungalow 8, and started snoring. </p> <p>Jen had spent a large amount of time (and expense) visiting celebrity nightclubs, and working on Gigi's character, in order to make her stories convincing. From this first call it was clear that this research was redundant \u2013 the journalist at the Daily Mirror simply wrote down what Jen said, and didn't probe further. </p> <p>Our fabricated story appeared in the newspaper the following day without checks. Jen was told to send in her bank details to receive the \u00a350 payment for the story, which we did not do.</p> <p>As the investigation continued we created more and more outlandish stories to see at what point suspicions would be raised. We went on to feed fabricated stories successfully to the Daily Star, the Daily Mirror again, The Sun and the Daily Express. </p> <p>As the tales became more absurd, the effect was not that they received more scrutiny, but that the payments offered increased along with the coverage...</p> <p>In all, six fake celebrity stories were created and fed to the tabloid press in a two-week period in March 2009..</p> <p>Our biggest story was in The Sun, revealing that Sarah Harding from Girls Aloud was secretly a fan of Quantum Physics. </p> <p>It ran as a lead story in Gordon Smart's Bizarre column. Smart's article also included a fabricated quote: 'There is a lot more going on under that blonde barnet than Sarah is given credit for. She's a smart cookie and does read an awful lot.' </p> <p>This quote didn't come from Jen, showing that the Sun will add fictitious quotes into their articles, as well as not running basic checks. </p> <p>At the time, Girls Aloud appeared regularly in The Sun, so it would have taken minutes to check with the agent or PR if there was any truth to our story. </p> <p>The Harding physics story was then was picked up by dozens of news sites around the world. Had we claimed it, the story fee would have earned us \u00a3600 from News International...</p> <p>Later... we look at the culture of criminality in tabloid newspapers. We talked to several journalists and ex-journalists off the record who told us that the [Clive] Goodman and [Glenn] Mulcaire convictions were just the tip of the iceberg. </p> <p>These sources explained that tabloid journalists, from the Sunday papers in particular, were still routinely breaking the law to get stories without any public interest. Our research also indicated that this behaviour was institutionally ingrained in tabloid culture...</p> <p>We wanted to test the Sunday tabloids to see if their journalists were willing to break the law, and the PCC code, to obtain private information about celebrities that was not in the public interest. </p> <p>The scenario was constructed to present the newspapers with a story that would involve them breaking the rules, and see which newspapers would engage with us.</p> <p>I would pose as an intermediary who was selling the details of celebrities plastic surgery operations, but was ignorant of the rules of modern tabloid reporting. I would claim that I was the ex-boyfriend of a nurse who worked in a plastic surgery clinic and who had evidence of high profile celebrities having operations. </p> <p>Given the intrusive nature of such stories, the newspapers would be likely to need to obtain proof that these stories were true in order to print them.</p> <p>Any such proof would inherently involve a breach of the Data Protection Act, which prohibits the sale of medical records. Even harvesting information to research the stories would involve a breach of the DPA, as this would constitute a fishing expedition.</p> <p>The DPA does have a general opt-out for journalists where the information is in the public interest...

      "bodyText": "With the NHS \"reforms\" in full swing, the failures of rail privatisation provide important lessons. Britain has the most expensive train fares in the world. On the back of the McNulty review, the government is now set to push them even higher. How does a service intended to benefit millions find itself impoverishing them, and why is our political class determined to let it continue? Roy McNulty's rail report was a sad spectacle, the elephant in the room so enormous it's a wonder he found space to breathe. Commissioned by Labour but published under the coalition, it found the costs of our fragmented system had created a 40% \"efficiency gap\" over our continental neighbours and their mostly nationalised railways. Finance isn't the only place the market failed. It is estimated around 2,000 firms now operate Britain's trains. After a string of fatal crashes, culminating at Hatfield in 2000, the safety record of the marketised system lay in tatters. Railtrack, the commercial company setup to oversee track maintenance, was effectively renationalised, becoming Network Rail. Fragmentation and the contested liabilities it creates pose a serious barrier to safety. How long before Andrew Lansley's NHS \"kitemark\" has its own Hatfield moment, none can say. In its last year before privatisation, our railways required just \u00a3431m in public subsidy. By 2006, the figure had reached over \u00a36bn. Economists at UBS found British fares are now the most expensive in the world. In 2009, the thousand-pound fare milestone was breached for the first time \u2013 a fitting tribute to market \"innovation\". Even the Conservative former transport minister, Philip Hammond, has conceded the trains have become \"a rich man's toy\". For so-called \"choice\", if you arrive at Victoria and you need a train to Brighton, there is one company and one price (\u00a324.10). In Europe, the same fare would cost an average \u00a311. If we paid the same fares as the French with their nationalised service, it is estimated we would save over \u00a34bn a year. Yes, if you dig around three years in advance and have a small team of analysts at your disposal, you might just find a bargain. But woe betide the swaggering Johnny who turns up at a British station and expects to just stroll onto a train at a fair price; that braggadocio is a thing of the past. Indeed, the fare system has become so complex that on one route, London to Manchester, 34 different fares were found. Gerry Doherty, head of the TSSA rail union, criticised the train operating companies (TOCs) for \"deliberately confusing\" fare structures designed to ensure \"passengers end up paying for a dearer ticket at all times\". If you find rail fares a confusing mess, as even rail staff do, just wait until you have to rummage through 30-page exemption documents to select your NHS top-up plan. For comfort, Britain now has the most crowded trains in Europe. Passengers should remember that for the train operators, overcrowding is highly profitable. The more passengers you can cram into a single cart, the more revenue you raise from lower costs: profit. To understand how this dynamic might play in healthcare, look at the PFI built hospitals: cutting bed numbers was a primary source of savings. With the P word taboo, McNulty's hands were tied in identifying the glaring problem with our rail system. Instead, he struck upon the idea of \"managing peak demand\" by raising prices still further. Peak users are mainly working people who do not choose their working hours; they are not crushed into the busiest trains of the day by choice. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, suggests raising fares will simply \"price people on lower incomes off trains and make little difference to overcrowding\". How will Lansley's market \"manage demand\" \u2013 again, no one knows. Transport secretary Justine Greening is seeking to find \u00a33.5bn yearly savings by 2019 but there seems little hint of any coherent plan behind it. The public are quite clear \u2013 they want rail renationalised. A 2009 poll showed 51% back the renationalisation of rail, including a third of Conservative voters. Just 11% back the current model. Rail privatisation has failed in the most unequivocal terms. The public can see it, the unions can see it and the taxpayers can see it. The only people who can't are the firms profiting from the mess and their supporters in parliament. Our national health service is now hurtling down the same broken track. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",

Cross Street Unitarian Chapel has been granted the licence which will allow same-sex couples to hold religious and civil ceremonies in the building. The, originally the \"Dissenters' Meeting House\", is the mother Church of Non-Conformity in Manchester. The original Chapel erected in 1694 on the site was probably the very first building erected for non-Conformist worship in Lancashire. William Gaskell, the husband of novelist Elizabeth Gaskell, was famously minister at Cross Street between 1828 and 1884. The Gaskell Society continues to meet at the chapel and there's a Gaskell Room that houses early editions of her novels. The Reverend Jane Barraclough, the current minister of Cross Street Chapel, told the BBC that offering the service fulfilled \"a basic human right\". A new law allowing civil partnership ceremonies to be conducted in places of worship came into effect in December 2011. She said: \"We note with sadness the history of homophobia in many faith traditions as well as the current hateful language from some faith leaders that has received so much coverage in the media. But this is a time of great celebration for us, not sadness.\" The Unitarian Church is separate from the Church of England and has ministers who are openly gay. It was formally resolved that the Unitarian ministry be open to all, regardless of sex, race, colour or sexual orientation, in 1977l The Church of England has said it will not allow its churches to be used for civil partnership ceremonies unless the full general synod gives its consent. A Home Office spokesperson said it is the first time a council has contacted the General Register Office to say it has granted a civil partnership licence to a place of worship.",

      "bodyText": "Andy Flower has warned his England players to expect another exacting trial by spin in Sri Lanka despite the poor recent Test match form of their opponents. Mahela Jayawardene's team have not won a series since August 2009, and have lost their last four against South Africa, Pakistan, at home to Australia, and in England at the start of last summer. But England have struggled on recent visits to Sri Lanka, with eight members of the squad playing in the 1-0 series defeat on their last tour in December 2007. Flower also points to the performances of Jayawardene's team in the recent triangular one-day tournament in Australia, when they qualified for the final ahead of India and lost narrowly to the hosts despite the financial uncertainty that continues to surround Sri Lankan cricket. \"It's a tough challenge, one of the toughest places to go and win,\" said England's cricket director. \"Sri Lanka are a good side and have just played some good cricket in Australia. \"But that is the challenge for us now. We knew going into this year that we had a lot of subcontinent cricket. I'd like to see us improve our skills in that part of the world. \"It's exciting for our experienced cricketers to prove that they can adapt. We also have a very important tour to India this year and the lessons we learn in Sri Lanka will be crucial there.\" Flower and the bulk of the squad flew out of Heathrow , but the captain, Andrew Strauss, has led an advance party of batsmen who have been there for almost a week, as England aim to avoid being caught cold \u2013 metaphorically \u2013 on spinning pitches in steamy Sri Lankan conditions, as they were by Pakistan in the Dubai dust in January. \"The biggest lesson we have had to learn is the skill against spin,\" Flower said. \"This is going to be crucial as to how we do. If we can show what we learned from two months in the UAE, we can expect to do well. I am confident we will perform better than we did in the Tests against Pakistan. It was really good to see how we responded after the Test series. There were obvious signs that our batsmen had learned something.\" Sri Lanka's spin attack has not been as formidable in recent Tests as the Pakistan trio of Saeed Ajmal, Abdur Rehman and Mohammad Hafeez \u2013 although a cynic might note that they have not had the benefit of bowling against England. Rangana Herath remains a skilful and experienced slow left-armer, especially at home, and could be supported by either Suraj Randiv, Ajantha Mendis or both. However, England should go into the series, which begins in Galle in a fortnight, the better-prepared of the two teams for one of the unsatisfying two-Test rubbers that seem to be cropping up regularly. Whereas they will begin the first of two three-day warm-up games against a Sri Lankan Board XI on Thursday, Sri Lanka's players have another round of one-day matches to play in the Asia Cup in Bangladesh, and will return home less than 48 hours before the start of the first Test on 26 March. That is typical of the maladministration that has led the Sri Lankan Cricket Board into such deep financial trouble, partly as a result of upgrading their main grounds to stage matches in last year's World Cup. They are estimated to be at least \u00a338m in debt, and the players have regularly been kept waiting for their wages. However, with Jayawardene and his equally high-class colleague Kumar Sangakkara remaining in the middle order, it is easy to see why Flower is expecting another stiff test.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Bramah is the assistant chief executive of the Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE) Public service reform is looking at the wrong end of the telescope: It's all talk of mutuals, outsourcing, choice, third sector or private sector, personal budgets. This is all putting the cart before the horse. The key fundamentals that are found within the conversation with local communities \u2013 the correct starting point, are the proposed relationship between individuals, communities and the state and the commissioning triangle of the balance between needs, priorities and resources. It is only when you resolve those issues that you then assess what models are right where they are relevant. John Tizard is an independent strategic advisor and commentator on public policy Consider outcomes and resources carefully: When considering the form that public services should take it is vital to be clear about the outcomes being sought, the options for securing those outcomes and the benefits and disadvantages. It is also essential to understand the resources available. This requires the adoption of a strategic commissioning approach which involves service users, staff, wider community interests and potential providers. It should be absolutely focused on outcomes and values but neutral as to the provider. We should not assume that the new model will be an outsourced model: Some local authorities are taking services back in house and others are questioning whether the traditional outsourcing model can answer their needs. So the business and social sectors have to be ready to change and evolve too. Too many authorities are hoping that somehow the need for change will go away: There has to be excellent leadership within the sector and within individual local authorities to encourage, drive and secure change and innovation. This will mean some experimentation with some failure \u2013 what matters is to try, to understand the risks and the learn the lessons. If we don't do anything there will be a greater fall in morale and even worse, services users and communities will be the losers. Siobhan Coughlan is programme manager on the Productivity Programme at the Local Government Association The key lesson is the need to invest resources to understand and engage customers in the first place: By applying different customer insight tools and techniques including: consultation and focus groups, demographic data, performance data, analysing customer feedback, mapping customer journeys and seeking feedback from frontline staff and partner deliverers \u2013 we can then better target the services we deliver to different customers and use different channels (including cheaper digital ones) to deliver these both more effectively and more efficiently. Councils that start with the customer and work with partners to pool their collective insights about shared customers are much more likely to deliver joined up, better public services. Nigel Bates is strategic development director for Serco's specialist BPO and ICT business Work with others to understand your customer: It is only when we really understand our citizen's perspectives on the services that we provide that we can start to re-design them. We spend a lot of time in our transformation work listening to service users and their experience as they try to gain access to services they need, to determine how it feels. Don't lose sight of what we do well: The most fundamental thing to protect from the old way of doing things are those aspects that are germane to public service, like safeguarding the vulnerable. The public sector has some of the best ways of identifying people at risk. Morale is important, communicate with staff about change: Every time we engage with a new customer they sense change \u2013 that's what we do. It's very normal for staff to worry and fear the unknown. Colin Whitehouse is an independent local government advisor We need to be able to plan for the long term, not five or 10 years at a time: One of the major blockages to making progress is that there's never enough time given to implement the changes that are proposed. Change is mostly driven by a political agenda where new ideas are constantly sought to enhance chances of re-election. What happens in practice at the grass roots is that programmes get half way through implementation, if they're lucky, and then there's a sudden change of direction and all of the effort is wasted. It's difficult to see how it can be avoided. I'm not saying that progress hasn't been achieved, but the idea of five or 10 year plans is wholly unrealistic. Steven Howell is a research fellow at Localis What does the \"old model\" really look like? In a slight challenge to the casual assumption that outsourcing is the new model; local authority commissioning has been going on for decades. So is a so-called new model less about direct provision and more about commissioning plus, where entire functions are completely redesigned through the commissioning process? In our Commission Impossible report we argued for greater focus on outcomes and not processes \u2013 we have suggested that local authorities should be open minded about the methods for achieving savings and work with others to design new solutions. Variety is the spice of life: Local authorities should be able to choose what model best suits them, whether that's a slimmed down or shared service variant on the traditional model, or something new and radical. Of course, some authorities believe that they can continue along more traditional lines, for this spending review at least, but the question is what will happen if (or when) there is another round of cuts? If it's not yet broken, it's certainly creaking at the seams: Central government seems to be more willing to listen to bold ideas from local government than it has been for some time, so perhaps now is the time to be brave. Kate Denham is an executive in the BDO local government team Prioritisation is important: It may be that all services could benefit from an innovative new delivery model but the process is resource intensive. Given the significant proportion of all budgets that is spent on social care, surely this should be the starting point for any council when considering new ways of delivering services? Even if the temptation is to start with the more 'straightforward' options such as waste and streetscene. The phrase \"broken\" is potentially unhelpful: Clearly the public sector has managed to continue delivering complex and vital services in the face of significant spending reductions so it's obvious why people take affront to the term. When people speak of delivery models as being broken they really mean that the existing structure will increasingly become difficult to maintain in the face of increasing demand and reductions in cost. The debate then does not come down to public sector delivery or private sector delivery, or local government bashing, but down to what delivery model we can adopt, that will result in a lower cost of delivering the service, maintain service, and manage demand better. Lynne Wardle is co-founder and a director of Taylor Haig Foundation Including citizens is important, but we need to be able to make decisions for them too: There have been a lot of comments that support the need to understand customers, start with their views and design services that way. I wonder if customers always know what's best? Radical innovation is often not a collaborative process. Further, in designing services for users, we start from an implicit assumption that we know what the problem is. I doubt 'high demand families\" would describe themselves as such. Whose problems are we trying to solve? Ours or theirs? Claudia Megele is a senior lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire Ownership and communication are both essential for well-run services: Any service delivery model that does not acknowledge, adopt and leverage social media strategies for rethinking and reorganising services, is incompatible with the increasingly diversified demand of service users and shrinking reaction time for service providers. The pace of change combined with diversity of cases require that public servants, and in particular frontline staff, are given sufficient autonomy to operate within a larger framework for services. People engage with what they feel a part of and what they help build. Therefore, engagement of local communities is key to ensure that they develop a sense of ownership in processes of service production and service delivery. You can read the discussion in full here.

      "bodyText": "Examining the listings for Knebworth-based rock event Sonisphere, it's hard to pinpoint who most misjudged Saturday night's headline slot. Was it Queen for drafting in Adam Lambert as their new singer? Not really, he's a decent enough warbler. So was it Adam himself for joining Queen when he's got a new album of his own to promote? Maybe, but it's a decent enough gig. No, the finger should be pointed at Sonisphere itself for daring to picture the massed punters of this self-styled \"world's largest touring rock festival\" greeting an American Idol runner-up banging out I Want To Break Free with a warm reception that takes the form of anything more than a tsunami of piss. Unbelievably, this is not the most absurd billing of this year's festival season, in which names such as Emeli Sand\u00e9, Dappy and Tom Jones mingle with the Darkness, the Courteeners and Simple Minds. Even an orgy with that lot would be preferable to what lies ahead for the eardrums of 2012's festival-goers. This \"variety\" is nothing to do with the well-judged eclecticism that characterises sparkier events like Bestival or Lovebox. Nor does it feel as if festival organisers have said, \"Do you know what, people like a bit of everything these days, let's book accordingly.\" The promise of Olly Murs on a festival stage feels more like a result of the traditional indie music world \u2013 until five years ago the bread and butter of the outdoor festival \u2013 flatlining, failing to deliver much beyond Noah &amp; The Whale and the Vaccines, and sending roofless rock gigs into a tailspin. Mainstream alternative music in 2012 is an unholy tug of war between Ed Sheeran and Skrillex, and this year's festival lineups look like the country's festival bookers collectively throwing their hands in the air, turning to potential ticket-buyers and going, \"OH I DON'T KNOW \u2013 YOU BLOODY SORT IT OUT!\" While the Reading/Leeds lineup, still to be announced, will probably stick to the usual business of music that's a bloody racket, many other festivals are sacrificing the personality they might once have had in favour of a simple \"if you've sold some records, you're booked\" mentality. It would take a very special type of cretin to moan about festivals putting together democratised, crowd-pleasing lineups, but the homogenisation is what really hurts. The current indie famine exacerbates a problem festival-land has encountered again and again in the last few years: too many events, too few decent acts. It's hard to find a single summer event at which Rizzle Kicks aren't booked to reiterate their trumpet allegiance. V, meanwhile, boasts names such as Snow Patrol, Nicki Minaj, the Stone Roses, David Guetta and Happy Mondays, while T In The Park goes for Snow Patrol, Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, David Guetta, and Nicki Minaj \u2026 And if you miss acts like Professor Green, Tinie Tempah, Elbow, Example or Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds at T, don't worry, they're all playing at the Isle Of Wight festival, too.

      "bodyText": "11.45am Star continues to shine ahead of Gold Cup Tony Paley: Paul Nicholls reiterated on Saturday morning that he is \"nearly there\" in his battle to get Kauto Star fit for Friday's Cheltenham Gold Cup. The 12-year-old was described as \"50-50\" for the Cheltenham Festival highlight last week after suffered a schooling fall at the trainer's Ditcheat yard. But the most popular chaser in training has since made excellent progress iand delighted Nicholls in a gallop after racing at Wincanton on Friday. \"We're very happy. It was just what we wanted. He went nicely and was full of enthusiasm,\" he told Channel 4's The Morning Line. \"He came back last night and was straight into his grub. He ate up this morning and there's not a bother on him. We're really, really pleased. He's 100% sound this morning so we're very happy.\" Nicholls confirmed that he will school Kauto Star on Monday before committing to a run. He said: \"You don't have to decide until the day before technically, but we're going to school him on Monday morning. The signs are all good - he came out of that yesterday and he appears to be back to 100% normal now.\" \"The improvement from one Friday to the following was just absolutely unbelievable and we've still got a week to go. We're very happy with him and he's in great form now.\" David Pipe also told Morning Line viewers that he will decide on Monday whether he will pitch unbeaten novice Grands Crus into the Gold Cup. The seven-year-old, who is unbeaten over fences, is also entered in the RSA Chase and Pipe will consult with owners Roger Stanley and Yvonne Reynolds before selecting a target. \"We will make a decision on Monday. We will see how Kauto is - obviously he looked in fantastic form yesterday at Wincanton,\" said Pipe. \"It looks like he will be going for the Gold Cup which is great for racing, but maybe not so good for us. I shall speak with the owners over the weekend and decide on Monday.\" Saturday's best bets, by Will Hayler Ted Spread (3.15) looked a different proposition when fitted with a tongue-tie on his most recent start and can outspeed his rivals to take the Paddy Power Imperial Cup at Sandown today. Whether the Paul Nicholls-trained runner is robust enough to claim the \u00a375,000 bonus on offer from the sponsors to any horse who wins this race and goes on to taste further success at the Cheltenham Festival must be doubtful. But this purer test of pace should suit Ted Spread, a high-class performer on the Flat for Mark Tompkins who even lined up in the 2010 Derby. He lost his way for the Newmarket trainer but appears to have had his enthusiasm rekindled by a switch of stables and the application of the tongue-tie. Lucaindubai is the each-way alternative, having finished a good fourth in the same race 12 months ago. The likelihood of an end-to-end gallop in this big field can bring out the best in him again. Sandown 2.05 A hot handicap where the form is usually worth following in the months ahead. Off The Ground impressed when getting the better of a thrilling battle with Tante Sissi over track and trip last time out and he is improving. Wolverhampton 2.20 Dunelight and Jack Sullivan have both returned from unsuccessful stints at the Dubai Carnival to win this prize in the last couple of years, so Belgian Bill's recent air miles need not be against him. However, Docofthebay just gets the nod after an encouraging return to all-weather action over an inadequate six furlongs last time out. Sandown 2.40 Making his debut for Paul Nicholls after a breathing operation, Martys Mission shaped with some promise at this track last month. The handicapper has pushed him up 4lb for that run, but he remains very feasibly treated on his best form. Nicholls has won this race in five of the last 10 years. Wolverhampton 3.30 Having completely lost the plot towards the end of last season, Light From Mars starts the new campaign on a good mark and has gone particularly well when fresh in the past. Sandown 3.50 The return to turf and a more testing track should suit Call Me A Star, who took a little too long to reach top gear at Kempton last time. \u2022 Click here for all the day's racecards, form, stats and results. \u2022 And post your tips or racing-related comments below.",

It says the book is for 12yrs+, and im almost 12 but I dont think it would interest many teenagers if it just teaches you how to play bridge (which is also a very confusing game).

It says the book is for 12yrs+, and im almost 12 but I dont think it would interest many teenagers if it just teaches you how to play bridge (which is also a very confusing game). I do hope that Louis Sachar's writing will improve soon! </p> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Kofi Annan has arrived in Damascus to launch the latest initiative to stop the bloodshed in Syria, but opposition leaders said that any deal with President Bashar al-Assad was unthinkable while civilians were being killed by government forces. Opposition activists said that at least 26 people were killed across Syria on Friday, but there were also signs of more cracks in the Assad regime. A Turkish official said that two Syrian generals, a colonel and two sergeants had defected to Turkey on Thursday, soon after Syria's deputy oil minister, Abdo Hussameldin, and a brigadier general announced their desertion of the regime on YouTube videos. Western diplomats speculated on Friday that the public nature of their renunciation of the Assad government had encouraged other high-ranking officers to follow their example. The new defectors were among 234 Syrians who have crossed into Turkey since Thursday. The defections were welcomed by EU foreign ministers meeting in Copenhagen, where they were portrayed as a sign that sanctions against the Damascus government were working. \"It is very good news that clearly high-ranking state and military officials are increasingly turning away from the Assad regime,\" said Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, said, speaking in Berlin before his departure for the Danish capital. \"The process of disintegration of the Assad regime has begun; the signs of erosion will continue. No country can be led in the long term with cruelty and repression.\" Annan, a former UN secretary general who has been appointed joint UN-Arab League envoy, is due to meet Assad during his visit to Damascus. He said he was taking \"realistic\" proposals to halt the killing, but did not go into details. Burhan Ghalioun, the leader of the main opposition group, the Syrian National Council, said that any talks with Assad were pointless as long as the regime continued to massacre its own people. \"It feels like we are watching the same movie being repeated over and over again,\" Ghalioun told the Associated Press in an interview from Paris. \"My fear is that, like other international envoys before him, the aim is to waste a month or two of pointless mediation efforts.\" The UN humanitarian co-ordinator, Lady Amos, said on Friday that Syria had agreed to a joint mission to assess the country's emergency relief needs, but added that the regime had to do more. \"While this is a necessary first step, it remains essential that a robust and regular arrangement be put in place, which allows humanitarian organisations unhindered access to evacuate the wounded and deliver desperately needed supplies,\" Amos told journalists in Ankara after touring Syrian refugee camps along the Turkish border. In Beijing, China announced on Friday that it is sending its own envoy to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and France to explain its proposal for a Syrian ceasefire. The foreign ministry spokesman, Liu Weimin, said that the assistant foreign affairs minister, Zhang Ming, would meet Arab League leaders during the seven-day trip, which begins on Sunday.",

Anyway, Prescott is good value. It's hard to believe that it wasn't so long ago that he was deputy prime minister.

It may not be cutting-edge comedy \u2013 more like comfort food, something nice and reassuring for a Friday night in. But the new format, with three guests, has certainly made it jollier and livelier, breathed new life into the old show.

Chelsea's 95 points in 2005 remains the record with only Manchester United and Chelsea claiming more than 90 \u2013 91 each respectively \u2013 in other seasons. City have 66 points to lead United by two and Mancini said: \"Ninety-nine \u2013 if we get to that I know for sure we will win. We have 66 and there are 33 left available. I'm not good at mathematics but I know that if we get 99 we will be OK.\" Mancini also said that Mario Balotelli, who came on for the closing stages of Thursday's 1-0 Europa League defeat at Sporting Lisbon, is in line to start every game between now and the end of the season. \"Yes, I think so. When he played in Lisbon he did well for 20, 25 minutes.\" Mancini has remained a staunch supporter of the Italian despite his misdemeanours, which included visiting a strip club in Liverpool the night before the win over Bolton Wanderers. Asked if it was not time for him to repay this faith Mancini said: \"I hope so but also last Saturday against Bolton he played well. He scored, missed a few but he did well. He will enjoy [the responsibility of leading the team in the title run-in]. But I think all the players are enjoying this moment.\" Vincent Kompany is out for up to two weeks due to the calf injury he suffered against Sporting Lisbon so will miss Sunday's trip to Swansea City but Mancini played down the groin problem picked up by Joleon Lescott in the same game. \"I don't think it's a big problem,\" he said. Kompany's injury offers an opportunity for Kolo Tour\u00e9, who believes that following his six-month ban for failing a drugs test he can now offer the team something. \"I'm here for that. We have a big squad and every time the manager needs a player to come in and give his best, we have to do it. I'm more hungry than ever after the difficult time I had.\" While Tour\u00e9 is certain City can overcome the 1-0 defeat to Sporting in the return leg next Thursday, he believes that the return of his brother, Yaya, who missed the game due to suspension will be crucial. \"He's a great player. Technically, he's unbelievable. He can play up front, he can play at the back. He can even play in the middle.\" Kolo Tour\u00e9 rates City and United as even favourites for the title: \"It's tough. We know United are tough because of all the experience and quality they have. To be honest, it's 50-50. We just need to be careful. It's going to be a great end to the season.\" Asked how City can compete with United's experience, he said: \"We have a few players who have been winning big trophies, like Yaya [with Barcelona], like David Silva, who has won the World Cup [with Spain]. We have a few players who have won trophies and we just need to transfer that into the City team. \"I think it's a good challenge and we will see if we can do it. It's going to be like a final for us [against Swansea]. Every game we play until the end of the season is going to be massive. We will give all against Swansea. We know it will be a difficult game, but with the quality and experience we have, we can do a good job there.\"",

The proposals, hardening the party's position on welfare, were set out in a speech by the shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, and in a Smith Institute pamphlet written by the shadow employment minister, Stephen Timms. Byrne said: \"The right to work must carry with it a responsibility to work. \"The truth is that the government is actually weakening the obligation to work. It is perfectly possible under the government's arrangements to sail through two years of the work programme and straight back on to the dole on the other side. We don't think that is good enough.\" The work programme \u2013 whereby private contractors are paid by results if they help jobseekers find work \u2013 has faced criticisms. There are fears that its targets are unrealistic during the downturn, too many jobs found are part-time, and there has been allegations of fraud at one provider, A4e. But Byrne said: \"We don't think that if you can work, you should be allowed to live a life on benefits. So, as we explore new ways to create jobs, we'll look at new ways to enforce the responsibility to work if you can. If you can work, you should.\" In his pamphlet, Timms proposes that anyone coming to the end of their work programme attachment, and who had not been successfully placed into employment, would receive an offer \u2013 a job guarantee. There could be benefit sanctions if someone refused all the options offered. He writes that legislation could be altered so that a jobseeker could be offered either six months on a job or six months without benefit. He writes: \"We need to instil a culture of work in every community in the country. Our view is that people in receipt of benefits have a responsibility to work hard to find a job, and to take up the opportunity of work when it is offered. \"Labour's approach reflects the party's conviction \u2013 drawn from a long-term commitment to the goal of full employment \u2013 that people have a right to work, and the responsibility to do so when they are able. We will be tough on those who seek to shirk their responsibility.\" Labour's tough stance follows a government U-turn over its work experience programme, when it bowed to pressure from big business and dropped benefit sanctions against young people on the scheme. Businesses had threatened to withdraw from the scheme unless the government dropped plans to penalise young people who dropped out of the eight-week programme by withdrawing their jobseeker's allowance for two weeks.",

      "bodyText": "Noel Gallagher: So, Mario, I gotta say, it's an honour for me to meet you. Mario Balotelli: Honour for me. NG: As a Manchester City supporter, I've supported Manchester City for 40 years, 40 YEARS can you believe that? That's a long time. What I wanna know is when you first got the call about coming to Manchester City, had you heard anything about the club at all? MB: No, nothing. NG: Nothing at all? MB: No. NG: Apart from we play in blue and we were rubbish apparently. MB: No I didn't know nothing. NG: Had you heard anything about the city of Manchester \u2026 apart from Man United? MB: I came three years ago, I played in the game with United so I came here. NG: OK. NG: Right. How big a part did Mancini play to get you to coming to City? MB: Yeah if Mancini wasn't here I think I never come here. NG: No? MB: No. NG: So you \u2026 you've known him since you were a young man. I mean you're still a young man now but you've known him since you were 16, 17? MB: How long do I know him? NG: Yeah. MB: Err when I was 15. NG: Was he the coach at Inter when you joined? MB: Yes, for the first team and I used to play in the like kind of academy. NG: Right OK. And would you say he's a good coach? MB: He's a good manager? NG: Yeah. MB: Of course. NG: I think so, I think he's great. And what do you think \u2026 with the way that the team is now, we're top of the league and how far do you think we can go? MB: I tell you in the end. NG: In the end? MB: It's unlucky to say before. NG: No I know, I'm the same when people ask me \"can we win the league?\" I always say that if it's a two-horse race between City and United and for all the things that we've done this season that we deserve to win it. Now whether, whether we can get over the line or not but I think we've got the best players, certainly. MB: If you ask me if we deserve to win \u2026 NG: Yeah. MB: If we keep playing like that then yes we deserve it. NG: Absolutely I think so too. NG: Right, Rafaella Te Amo, your missus, she's a beauty isn't she? MB: Yeah. NG: Yeah? What does that mean, does that mean Rafealla I love you? MB: Yeah. NG: Yeah? Does she appreciate that? MB: Yeah of course. NG: Nice one. And so have you brought any family with you over here? MB: There is only my little brother. NG: Is he the one you were doing magic tricks for? You know there was when we was playing some game against err \u2026 MB: Yeah, no that is his friend and my brother. NG: Right. Where did you learn to do magic? MB: Magic, it's one guy I don't know he's in Manchester no. I was in Trafford Centre and he came, he just show me tricks so one day I invited him to my house and he teach me something. NG: So there's a guy in the Trafford Centre doing magic tricks and you said come and show me some stuff? MB: Yes. NG: To entertain your \u2026 MB: Because we were like in 10 people me and my friends so you know the people that do magician no they cannot teach you. NG: That's right they can't teach you. MB: So I said to him, I took him alone and I say to him \"listen I invite you to my house so you can teach me\" and he say \"OK\". NG: Nice. So how many tricks do you know? MB: Err no just one. NG: Just the one trick? MB: Yeah but it's difficult. NG: It's magic. MB: Yeah. NG: That's why it's difficult. Oh yeah, when I was watching training before, Carlos is back. MB: Yeah. NG: He looks happy. MB: Yeah. NG: And fit. But when you see pictures of him that they put in the papers he looks quite mean and unhappy but I've just watched him training with you guys there and he \u2026 MB: Ah the paper they just \u2026 NG: Yeah we all know that but I just, I mean maybe you could give us the official story but I've just seen it with my own eyes he looks as happy as I've ever seen him. He looked fit and raring to go. MB: When, I don't know when he didn't play, I don't know, I wasn't there so I don't really know what happened but I think everyone can do a mistake, Carlos is part of the team so everyone is want to have fun with him and he's just part of the team so everybody love him. That's why he's happy. NG: So it's true to say that outside of all the politics that's going on between the club and the player the players themselves are still all great friends with him and would all have a strong bond with him? MB: Because like me, if I'm happy in Manchester now it's for the team, for my team-mates, how they are with me. NG: Yeah. MB: And for supporters, that's the good of this club. NG: Do you think Carlos will be in any way worried about the supporters' reaction to him if he \u2026 MB: I think supporters have to be like they were before, they shouldn't care because Carlos can hear, and if they do or if they make pressure on Carlos they make pressure to all the team so they shouldn't do nothing. NG: Well this is what I was saying before that I don't think there'll be booing, I think there might be maybe a tiny bit but I think it'll be mixed but I think the fans should still respect him because he's gonna be one of our greatest ever players. MB: Of course. NG: And if he leaves, he leaves, you know footballers move on \u2026 MB: It's normal, every one of us we came from outside, we stay, we go, it's normal. NG: I think that's the modern day football but I agree with ya, but I was \u2026 it was interesting to see him out there with a smile on his face and \u2026 MB: Yeah. NG: Playing away there and it was good to see. NG: So apparently Mancini in his press conference this morning said again that you need to mature but we don't think you need to mature. MB: No, OK, I'm \u2026 if Mancini say something he's right but I'm 21 so I still young and I think that already from last year I'm already bigger like in my head \u2026 NG: Well me too \u2026 well I would agree, I think \u2026 from the outside looking in, but there's some things we don't want you to mature about you know. MB: No but if you look me from outside and you don't know me and you think I'm an idiot [smiles and laughs]. NG: NO, no, no, no, no do you know I go round the world and you know a lot of when you mention Man City and people tend to boo and all that but when you mention the name Balotelli [pause] everyone loves it. MB: [laughs] NG: Seriously it's like you've become the poster boy for naughty children. MB: [laughs] NG: My children love you and they don't even know who you are. MB: [laughs] NG: So tell us what \u2026 can you run me through \u2026 I'm fascinated by this, so the night before the derby at Old Trafford when we won six one [pause] the fire brigade are called when you set fire to your house \u2026 MB: I didn't. NG: Accidentally or so they say. MB: No I didn't. NG: OK can you clear that up? MB: So [laughs] you want me to tell you what happened? NG: If you want. MB: Only because it's you. NG: Nice one, thank you very much. MB: So it started like a joke no. NG: Right. MB: So, nah but that's stupid. [Both laugh] NG: Never mind, you can tell me later. MB: I was bored no, so I was with my friends and one of them was limping so I got one bin you know the bin? NG: Yeah. MB: But a metal one yeah. NG: OK [both laugh]. MB: For put fireworks inside. NG: OK. MB: But nothing gonna happen right, so I left the room and I left the fireworks but I didn't \u2026 NG: You didn't light them? MB: No, I walk out and then my friend go in the room and they just start screaming blah blah blah and the fireworks was going off and they put the fireworks on the bed, not on the bed sorry, on the toilet. NG: [laughs] MB: But just the curtain caught on fire, that's it, nothing else, they just made everything up. NG: Oh so the fire brigade weren't called? MB: Yeah, only because the firemen they came. NG: Oh right OK. MB: For the curtain and the toilet. NG: Oh because the alarm was going off right? MB: Just the toilet was lost. NG: So all that being said that part of the story, what were you thinking when you made the T-shirt, the \"why always me\" T-shirt? Did you have a feeling you were gonna score that day? MB: I thought I was gonna score three. NG: You were gonna score three? MB: Yeah. NG: Coz before the game started I thought you were gonna score the winner, I thought we were gonna win 1-0 and you were gonna score the winner at the Stretford End, and when you \u2026 I mean it was a great goal and the celebration with the T-shirt and the picture that was seen around the world \u2026 what did you think of that? MB: Of what? NG: Well did you think \u2026 when the top's going up did you think this picture's gonna be shown all round the world? MB: No, no, no just a message \u2026 NG: Was it a message? MB: It's not a question, that people do to me it's a question that I do to them. You understand? NG: So was it a message to the fans coz we love that \u2026 MB: No it was to all the people that just talking bad about me and say stuff not nice about me \u2026 NG: Oh to the press \u2026 MB: And they don't know me so just asking why always me, like, why always me? [Both laugh] NG: It was genius. Have you still got the T-shirt? MB: Yeah in Italy. NG: I would like that T-shirt. MB: OK I give it to you. NG: Serious? MB: Yeah. NG: Now he's said that on film, the T-shirt is mine, nice one. MB: OK [both laugh]. NG: Now there's a lot of very very very funny stories that are written about you in the papers could we clear some of them up you can tell me if some of them are true or false? MB: Like what? NG: We know this one is true, did you turn up at a women's jail in Milan and ask for a tour? MB: No I, you know that for go to jail you have to call them and you have to have like an invitation. So I have to go in one of them but it was for men no? And I was with my brother, but where I live there are two prison like one mile away. NG: Right. MB: So the gate was open and I went in the wrong one but I was in the parking so but when you go in the parking then they have to check everything and after like every time someone just talk, called the press \u2026 NG: And said that you turned up and asked for a tour? MB: Nah, I didn't, just stupid people. NG: Is it true that a young lad turned up here at the training ground, asked you for your autograph and you asked him why he wasn't at school and he said he was being bullied so you took him to school and spoke to the headmaster? MB: No. NG: That's not true either? You're blowing it all here Mario. MB: What? NG: You're blowing it all here mate. MB: No it's not true that I took him to school, no it's not true. I tell him why he wasn't at school but I didn't took him to school. NG: Really? MB: Yeah. NG: Are you having lessons to be a DJ from Tim Westwood? MB: Errr no \u2026 I had a picture with him, he asked me a picture, that's it. NG: [laughs] Right, and they said \u2026 MB: He's the DJ yeah? NG: Yeah, well, yeah he's a DJ.

NG: What do you think, because the British press they're known for making up stories about everybody, they used to do it to me and my brother a lot. MB: Yeah? NG: It's just sometimes it can be a bit \u2026 things like this can be a bit of fun but do you find it annoying? MB: Erm I think it \u2026 you can do what you want if you stay in the line. NG: Right. MB: They that go out from the line, kill them. [both laugh] NG: Erm [pause] is this true? I so want this to be true and \u2026 did your mum send you to John Lewis for an ironing board and you came back with a quad bike \u2026 MB: Yeah that's true [both laugh] NG: Yes. A quad bike, a scalextric and a tennis table? MB: Yeah. No a tennis table no \u2026 the trampoline. NG: [laughs] A trampoline? What would Mancini say if he thought you had a quad bike and a trampoline at your house? MB: He knows. NG: Does he? MB: Yeah. NG: Wouldn't he go like mad? Coz like \u2026 MB: The quad bike is also at my house, no. Why he have to go mad, for what? NG: Well in case you injure yourself. MB: Nah with a quad bike no. NG: Do you wear a helmet? Obviously no \u2026 MB: Yeah. NG: You do? MB: Right. You don't do you? NG: NO, yeah yeah [both laugh]. NG: Right [pause] are you allergic to grass, a specific kind of grass?

MB: Hay fever what is this? NG: It's like people get in the summer when errr \u2026 how do we describe hay fever? It's like when like the flowers come our people start to sneeze a lot \u2026 MB: No no no not that one, no it's like under my skin I have to scratch. NG: Really? MB: Yes. NG: Wow mental. And you're a footballer and allergic to some kind of grass. Is it true that you went into a petrol station and paid for everybody's petrol \u2026 MB: No that's not true, that's not true.

NG: Right, OK. Have you played darts recently and how good are you? MB: No I didn't play recently I played last year. NG: Right, so are you \u2026 have you ever got a 180? MB: What? I don't know about the game. I put it in the middle you know. NG: Oh in the bullseye? MB: Yeahs. NG: Nice one. One shot. Rock'n'roll star. Did you give a tramp a thousand pound after winning in a casino? MB: Never [laughs]. NG: Good lord. Did you go to church on Christmas Eve? MB: Yeah.

And then did you go to a pub in Wythenshawe and buy everybody a drink afterwards? MB: No I didn't. NG: OK. I wouldn't do that either to be honest, not in Wythenshawe. Tynchy Stryder, do you know Tynchy Stryder? MB: Yeah. NG: He wrote a song about you. MB: Yeah. NG: Have you heard it? MB: Yeah yeah. NG: Do you like it? MB: Yeah yeah, it's nice. NG: Is that your favourite kind of music, hip-hop? MB: His song? NG: Well no like that genre, hip-hop? MB: Yeah I like it. NG: Do you know anything about the Manchester music scene? MB: Singer?

MB: No. NG: The Smiths? MB: No. NG: Stone Roses? MB: No. NG: Oasis. MB: Yes [laughs]. NG: Now, you were recently named the third [best] dressed man in Britain by GQ \u2026 MB: Second! NG: Second? Nice one. How does that feel? MB: Don't care. NG: Coz we had one of the players in here before who'll remain nameless, but his initials are AJ \u2026 MB: What? NG: AJ \u2026 OK it was Adam Johnson he came in here and he was saying that the fact that you were named second best dressed man is a travesty, he said \u2026 MB: Yeah but listen, I don't wanna offend nobody but an English person cannot speak about style with an Italian person [smiles]. NG: Well, that's true but a Mancunian can, well Adam's not from Manchester, but Mancunians are known for being impeccably \u2026 as you can see, for being impeccably dressed but I'm not gonna go for a fashion off with you because \u2026 MB: No I didn't say that English people wear bad clothes, I said Italian people are another level. NG: No question, we all wear Italian shoes, these are Italian shoes, they're nice \u2026 MB: Are they Italian? NG: Yeah, Golden Goose do you know that label? MB: [laughs] NG: Right, what music do you listen to in the dressing room with the players? MB: R&amp;B. NG: Really? MB: R&amp;B or hip-hop. NG: Does nobody ever play Oasis? MB: [pause] I don't think so. NG: I've got a CD for you later, you might have to bang it on there when Nigel's bogling. MB: [laughs] Yeah OK. NG: Yeah stick it on. MB: Thank you. NG: Is music a big part of your life would you say? MB: Hmmm? NG: Is music a big part of your life? MB: Errrrr \u2026 NG: You like music? MB: Yeah I like music. Yeah. Some music remind me of when I was young you know so, yeah. NG: I'll ask you about that, where do you hail from, originally? Where your \u2026 MB: I born in \u2026 oh originally? NG: Yeah. MB: Or where was I born? NG: Where were you born? MB: In Palermo, Sicily. NG: And where are your ancestors from? MB: Who? NG: Your parents \u2026 MB: My natural parents oh, from Ghana. NG: From Ghana? OK. And have you ever been to \u2026 have you been back there? MB: Never been to Africa in my life. NG: No? MB: Never. NG: I've only been to Egypt, it's very hot. Now listen, I am \u2026 I used to be in Oasis and now I've gone solo coz my brother was a bit crazy like you. MB: Really? NG: Yeah, and so I'm in a critically acclaimed and best-selling act called High Flying Birds have you ever heard of us? MB: Of what? NG: Of our music? MB: I knew about Oasis yes. NG: So I've got a CD for you. Now, so next time, when you're limbering up, when we're gonna play United on April the 30th on the Monday night, this will guarantee victory. MB: Yeah but you have to explain to the others \u2026 NG: Never mind them, you're in charge. Bang that on, if you could make it \u2026 if you could just see your way to when you score the winner pull up a little T-shirt that just said \"because Noel said so\". MB: [laughs] NG: Right, you'd made an old man very happy. NG: I've got to say it's been an absolute honour to meet you. MB: Thank you, and for me \u2026 NG: And you're one of my heroes \u2026 MB: No you are \u2026 NG: Ah no no no you're one of my heroes and all the lads that I go to the match with, there's about six or seven of us, we absolutely love you, but there you can have that. MB: Thank you. NG: Nice one mate. NG: So you had a tough upbringing and you were seriously ill as a child and then you were fostered at three years old, how do you think that has shaped your character, do you think it's made you a stronger person? MB: I never talk about when I was young but I think some experience when you are young then you can, in some people you can see when they grow up like, they show I some way \u2026 NG: Right. I think it shapes you as you get older your experiences as a young child somehow \u2026 MB: Yeah I think people yeah \u2026 because from outside people don't know me and they don't know how I am but I think I'm more old than my age. NG: Yeah you're more mature than for your years? I can see that [pause] The last Porto game when, it says you were racially abused by the Porto fans \u2026 MB: Yeah \u2026 NG: You suffered a bit of that in Italy as well \u2026 MB: Yeah in Italy yes, but I don't know if in Porto it was but I heard it but I don't know if it's just stupid people or proper racists I don't know. NG: It seems to be it was quite a contentious topic in England for about a fortnight but it's always sad I think when you see it and particularly in Europe, do you know what I mean, because you feel bad for the players but did you and Yaya speak about it afterwards apparently he was abused as well was he not? MB: No we didn't say nothing, we won so that's the most important thing. NG: Absolutely. Who is your favourite player? Ibrahimovic? MB: He's one of them yeah, him and Ronaldo, the Brazilian one. NG: Ronaldo, oh yeah. MB: He used to play for Inter Milan \u2026 NG: He was killer wasn't he? MB: Yeah \u2026 NG: Did he play for Inter? MB: Yeah. NG: While you were there? MB: No. Unfortunately no. NG: Wow. And who would you say the biggest influence has been on your career? MB: The biggest influence? NG: Yeah like who, say like obviously Mancini has brought you to England and he's been an influence on your career in England who would you say has been \u2026 MB: No Mancini is like \u2026 even in Italy because it is him that made me start to play in Serie A, in the league, in the first league in Italy. NG: And why do you think that Mourinho didn't believe in you? MB: That's his problem. NG: I'm glad he didn't because you're sat here now innit? MB: They say he want to come here? But me with Mourinho? I think he's a great manager but he didn't understand me so he said that nobody can understand me but I think the only one that cannot understand me is him so it's his problem. NG: You know when we played Tottenham recently? MB: Yeah. NG: And, so we've gone 2-0 up and Tottenham have come back we're two all and we get a penalty in injury-time, I was sat in a hotel room in Australia watching the match, do you feel any nerves when you're walking up to take the penalty kick knowing that we're going for the league title and this is up to that point the most significant kick of a ball in the entire season for any club so far? MB: Sometimes, it's not pressure I feel like I have to concentrate, I don't like to be concentrate I have just to do things as they come \u2026 NG: Just instinctively like that? MB: Yeah \u2026 that time I wasn't, I wasn't \u2026 NG: Do you prefer just playing by instinct and just letting things flow or is it \u2026 because this is what fascinates me is, when I watch you play I just think you're not thinking of anything you're just playing from the soul. But to walk up you've obviously got to mentally make a decision of where you're gonna put the ball, were you nervous in any way, were you calm, did you know you were gon \u2026 obviously you knew you were gonna score coz you never miss right? MB: The penalty? NG: Yeah yeah like you scored the penalty, but the lads tell me that you never miss in training. Have you ever missed a penalty? MB: Errr in the match or in training? NG: In training, no in the match? MB: In the match no. NG: I think I gotta say for somebody so young \u2026 for you to pick the ball up and say I'm taking this knowing that the league's on the line there you must have \u2026 there's some courage to do that, but I'm \u2026 MB: No, why? NG: Why? Because if it was any \u2026 a mere mortal like the rest of us \u2026 MB: Yeah but if it's me I go to the concert and I start to sing I cannot even talk because I'm shy \u2026 NG: See I understand that but when, if I go to a concert and I can't sing I guess it's not \u2026 if I have a bad show it's not, it wouldn't have been as seismic as if you'd have missed that penalty. MB: Yeah because you cannot play football so it's normal. NG: How do you know I can't play football? MB: You can play football? NG: No [both laugh]. MB: No but it's because you cannot play football in the Premier League so it's normal you could feel pressure. NG: Were the other players happy to let you take that penalty, or did \u2026 did \u2026 MB: Yeah because they know how I shoot like \u2026 NG: So they know of course \u2026 MB: When there is a free-kick on the right we know that Kolarov want to shoot because he's good so \u2026 NG: OK, and you take the penalties. Another thing before we wrap up, the goal with the shoulder \u2026 MB: [smiles] Ah I don't know it just came. NG: That's the kind of thing that you do in the school playground, that's never been seen on an English pitch before and I have to say I was watching it, I was on tour in a catering room in Copenhagen with lots of football supporters like some on my crew are City supporters and Liverpool supporters, there might even be a Man United supporter there and everybody stood up and applauded because it was just \u2026 maybe the goal of the season for me. But those things are just instinctive you don't think you just do it? MB: No, because I shoot the ball and the goalkeeper he catch it and then the ball goes high and thought the ball would go out so I was under the bar I was just under, I was just here and I saw the ball coming down but I couldn't go with the head because it was too late so I just go with the shoulder. NG: It's brilliant. NG: What do you think as a player \u2026 obviously with all the individual awards that are given out, the golden ball and all that and the golden boot and all that, what do you think individually as a player you'd like to achieve when you finally hang up your boots and jet back to the planet where you came from? MB: So what do I want to win before I finish football? NG: Yeah well obviously you want to win trophies but how far do you think you can go in the game do you think you can eventually be the best player in the world? Would you like to be the best player in the world? MB: I would like to yeah, but it's not only something that you would like it's something that you have to work for. NG: Totally. I think \u2026 mean I don't know what it's like but I think you're underneath the right manager to achieve that \u2026 MB: What? NG: I think you're working for the right manager if you want to be the best player in the world. MB: Yeah. NG: And it's said that you're quite a shy retiring young lad, would you say that's true? MB: What's retiring? NG: Well you know what shy means, retiring is like you like to keep yourself to yourself \u2026 MB: Yes, a lot, I don't like when people talk about my business or my life and I like to be \u2026 I'm really private. NG: I can see that \u2026 MB: So maybe someone thinks I'm arrogant or something but it's just me I'm \u2026 NG: Do you know what I think it is that, it's a British thing with the British press is if they don't understand people \u2026 MB: They never understand people \u2026 NG: No no but if, people like yourself who \u2026 you know \u2026 the average Premiership footballer is not like you do you know what I mean? MB: Who? NG: Just any footballer, like I don't know any footballer \u2026 you're kind of unique in the game of football at the moment and I think that the British media are \u2026 if they don't understand somebody they just think well we have to find out what makes this person tick and that's where all the stories come from but you shouldn't get too upset about it because they do it to everybody \u2026 MB: They do it to everybody? NG: Oh yeah, like all the great people \u2026 like me and you we always get stick from the press \u2026 MB: Yeah but that's normal, but just \u2026 NG: Did you get that in Italy at all? MB: Yeah of course, but \u2026 NG: And how do you deal with it , do you just choose not to \u2026 MB: I don't care because they can say what they want but me I'm a footballer so the most important moment is on Sunday on the pitch, after that they're totally different. NG: Correct, absolutely. MB: Ao they just say a lot of stuff about me, but they're just lying, they don't even know. You know if I go in the street one guy gets the picture, then they say \"oh Mario was there\" then they, someone call the press and say Mario is there, so the day after Mario was there, that's normal isn't it. Why? Because I just walk in town in town normal, like a normal guy and I go to the pub, just normal. NG: You go to the pub? MB: I've been to the pub yeah. Not to drink, but just to \u2026 NG: To play darts? MB: No [both laugh] [Direction \u2013 Mario any questions for Noel?] MB: Why do you like me? NG: I speak for all \u2026 well me personally there's just \u2026 there isn't that many footballers that you see \u2026 I've supported this club all my life \u2026 there isn't that many footballers that you see that when they get the ball they make you sit forward on your seat, very rare. You see, you get that and very rare we've had it at this club. But it's the little things \u2026 MB: That make you what? NG: Well say we're all sat at the match and we're watching football \u2026 when a player like you gets the ball everybody gets to the edge of their seat because you know something special could happen. But it's the little things that we love you for it's like the magic tricks and stealing Ag\u00fcero's gloves and the goal with the shoulder and the T-shirt celebration and it goes without saying you're a great footballer and I believe that truly over the next decade you'll be a truly great footballer, but it's footballers in general in this country, they're quite boring and dull and \u2026 I love you because you're Balotelli and you make me smile. MB: [laughs] [They shake hands] MB: Where did you get your ring from? NG: The ring? I got it in a shop in Japan, it's like when you're American and you leave college you get a ring like this. Do you get that in Italy? MB: No. NG: No we don't get it in England either, but yeah there you go. I would say I'd swap it you for the T-shirt. MB: What T-shirt? NG: Why always me? MB: No I'll give you the T-shirt no problem. NG: Brilliant, that's twice he's said that now. MB: You make me say it [both laugh].

      "body": "<p><strong>Noel Gallagher:</strong> So, Mario, I gotta say, it's an honour for me to meet you.</p> <p><strong>Mario Balotelli:</strong> Honour for me.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> As a Manchester City supporter, I've supported Manchester City for 40 years, 40 YEARS can you believe that? That's a long time. What I wanna know is when you first got the call about coming to Manchester City, had you heard anything about the club at all?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No, nothing.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Nothing at all?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Apart from we play in blue and we were rubbish apparently.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No I didn't know nothing.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Had you heard anything about the city of Manchester \u2026 apart from Man United?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> I came three years ago, I played in the game with United so I came here.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> OK.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Right. How big a part did Mancini play to get you to coming to City?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah if Mancini wasn't here I think I never come here.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> No?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> So you \u2026 you've known him since you were a young man. I mean you're still a young man now but you've known him since you were 16, 17?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> How long do I know him?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Err when I was 15.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Was he the coach at Inter when you joined?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yes, for the first team and I used to play in the like kind of academy.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Right OK. And would you say he's a good coach?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> He's a good manager?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Of course.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> I think so, I think he's great. And what do you think \u2026 with the way that the team is now, we're top of the league and how far do you think we can go?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> I tell you in the end.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> In the end?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> It's unlucky to say before.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> No I know, I'm the same when people ask me \"can we win the league?\" I always say that if it's a two-horse race between City and United and for all the things that we've done this season that we deserve to win it. Now whether, whether we can get over the line or not but I think we've got the best players, certainly.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> If you ask me if we deserve to win \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> If we keep playing like that then yes we deserve it.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Absolutely I think so too.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Right, Rafaella Te Amo, your missus, she's a beauty isn't she?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah? What does that mean, does that mean Rafealla I love you?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah? Does she appreciate that?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah of course.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Nice one. And so have you brought any family with you over here?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> There is only my little brother.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Is he the one you were doing magic tricks for? You know there was when we was playing some game against err \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah, no that is his friend and my brother.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Right. Where did you learn to do magic?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Magic, it's one guy I don't know he's in Manchester no. I was in Trafford Centre and he came, he just show me tricks so one day I invited him to my house and he teach me something.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> So there's a guy in the Trafford Centre doing magic tricks and you said come and show me some stuff?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> To entertain your \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Because we were like in 10 people me and my friends so you know the people that do magician no they cannot teach you.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> That's right they can't teach you.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> So I said to him, I took him alone and I say to him \"listen I invite you to my house so you can teach me\" and he say \"OK\".</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Nice. So how many tricks do you know?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Err no just one.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Just the one trick?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah but it's difficult.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> It's magic.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> That's why it's difficult. Oh yeah, when I was watching training before, Carlos is back.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> He looks happy.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> And fit. But when you see pictures of him that they put in the papers he looks quite mean and unhappy but I've just watched him training with you guys there and he \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Ah the paper they just \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah we all know that but I just, I mean maybe you could give us the official story but I've just seen it with my own eyes he looks as happy as I've ever seen him. He looked fit and raring to go.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> When, I don't know when he didn't play, I don't know, I wasn't there so I don't really know what happened but I think everyone can do a mistake, Carlos is part of the team so everyone is want to have fun with him and he's just part of the team so everybody love him. That's why he's happy.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> So it's true to say that outside of all the politics that's going on between the club and the player the players themselves are still all great friends with him and would all have a strong bond with him?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Because like me, if I'm happy in Manchester now it's for the team, for my team-mates, how they are with me.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> And for supporters, that's the good of this club.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Do you think Carlos will be in any way worried about the supporters' reaction to him if he \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> I think supporters have to be like they were before, they shouldn't care because Carlos can hear, and if they do or if they make pressure on Carlos they make pressure to all the team so they shouldn't do nothing.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Well this is what I was saying before that I don't think there'll be booing, I think there might be maybe a tiny bit but I think it'll be mixed but I think the fans should still respect him because he's gonna be one of our greatest ever players.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Of course.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> And if he leaves, he leaves, you know footballers move on \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> It's normal, every one of us we came from outside, we stay, we go, it's normal.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> I think that's the modern day football but I agree with ya, but I was \u2026 it was interesting to see him out there with a smile on his face and \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Playing away there and it was good to see.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> So apparently Mancini in his press conference this morning said again that you need to mature but we don't think you need to mature.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No, OK, I'm \u2026 if Mancini say something he's right but I'm 21 so I still young and I think that already from last year I'm already bigger like in my head \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Well me too \u2026 well I would agree, I think \u2026 from the outside looking in, but there's some things we don't want you to mature about you know.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No but if you look me from outside and you don't know me and you think I'm an idiot [smiles and laughs].</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> NO, no, no, no, no do you know I go round the world and you know a lot of when you mention Man City and people tend to boo and all that but when you mention the name Balotelli [pause] everyone loves it.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> [laughs]</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Seriously it's like you've become the poster boy for naughty children.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> [laughs]</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> My children love you and they don't even know who you are.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> [laughs]</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> So tell us what \u2026 can you run me through \u2026 I'm fascinated by this, so the night before the derby at Old Trafford when we won six one [pause] the fire brigade are called when you set fire to your house \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> I didn't.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Accidentally or so they say.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No I didn't.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> OK can you clear that up?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> So [laughs] you want me to tell you what happened?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> If you want.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Only because it's you.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Nice one, thank you very much.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> So it started like a joke no.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Right.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> So, nah but that's stupid.

Did you have a feeling you were gonna score that day?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> I thought I was gonna score three.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> You were gonna score three?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Coz before the game started I thought you were gonna score the winner, I thought we were gonna win 1-0 and you were gonna score the winner at the Stretford End, and when you \u2026 I mean it was a great goal and the celebration with the T-shirt and the picture that was seen around the world \u2026 what did you think of that?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Of what?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Well did you think \u2026 when the top's going up did you think this picture's gonna be shown all round the world?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No, no, no just a message \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Was it a message?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> It's not a question, that people do to me it's a question that I do to them. You understand?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> So was it a message to the fans coz we love that \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No it was to all the people that just talking bad about me and say stuff not nice about me \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Oh to the press \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> And they don't know me so just asking why always me, like, why always me?

Now, so next time, when you're limbering up, when we're gonna play United on April the 30th on the Monday night, this will guarantee victory.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah but you have to explain to the others \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Never mind them, you're in charge. Bang that on, if you could make it \u2026 if you could just see your way to when you score the winner pull up a little T-shirt that just said \"because Noel said so\".</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> [laughs]</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Right, you'd made an old man very happy.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> I've got to say it's been an absolute honour to meet you.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Thank you, and for me \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> And you're one of my heroes \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No you are \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Ah no no no you're one of my heroes and all the lads that I go to the match with, there's about six or seven of us, we absolutely love you, but there you can have that.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Thank you.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Nice one mate.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> So you had a tough upbringing and you were seriously ill as a child and then you were fostered at three years old, how do you think that has shaped your character, do you think it's made you a stronger person?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> I never talk about when I was young but I think some experience when you are young then you can, in some people you can see when they grow up like, they show I some way \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Right. I think it shapes you as you get older your experiences as a young child somehow \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah I think people yeah \u2026 because from outside people don't know me and they don't know how I am but I think I'm more old than my age.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah you're more mature than for your years? I can see that [pause] The last Porto game when, it says you were racially abused by the Porto fans \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> You suffered a bit of that in Italy as well \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah in Italy yes, but I don't know if in Porto it was but I heard it but I don't know if it's just stupid people or proper racists I don't know.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> It seems to be it was quite a contentious topic in England for about a fortnight but it's always sad I think when you see it and particularly in Europe, do you know what I mean, because you feel bad for the players but did you and Yaya speak about it afterwards apparently he was abused as well was he not?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No we didn't say nothing, we won so that's the most important thing.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Absolutely. Who is your favourite player? Ibrahimovic?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> He's one of them yeah, him and Ronaldo, the Brazilian one.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Ronaldo, oh yeah.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> He used to play for Inter Milan \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> He was killer wasn't he?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Did he play for Inter?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> While you were there?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No. Unfortunately no.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Wow. And who would you say the biggest influence has been on your career?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> The biggest influence?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah like who, say like obviously Mancini has brought you to England and he's been an influence on your career in England who would you say has been \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No Mancini is like \u2026 even in Italy because it is him that made me start to play in Serie A, in the league, in the first league in Italy.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> And why do you think that Mourinho didn't believe in you?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> That's his problem.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> I'm glad he didn't because you're sat here now innit?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> They say he want to come here? But me with Mourinho? I think he's a great manager but he didn't understand me so he said that nobody can understand me but I think the only one that cannot understand me is him so it's his problem.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> You know when we played Tottenham recently?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> And, so we've gone 2-0 up and Tottenham have come back we're two all and we get a penalty in injury-time, I was sat in a hotel room in Australia watching the match, do you feel any nerves when you're walking up to take the penalty kick knowing that we're going for the league title and this is up to that point the most significant kick of a ball in the entire season for any club so far?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Sometimes, it's not pressure I feel like I have to concentrate, I don't like to be concentrate I have just to do things as they come \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Just instinctively like that?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah \u2026 that time I wasn't, I wasn't \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Do you prefer just playing by instinct and just letting things flow or is it \u2026 because this is what fascinates me is, when I watch you play I just think you're not thinking of anything you're just playing from the soul. But to walk up you've obviously got to mentally make a decision of where you're gonna put the ball, were you nervous in any way, were you calm, did you know you were gon \u2026 obviously you knew you were gonna score coz you never miss right?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> The penalty?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah yeah like you scored the penalty, but the lads tell me that you never miss in training. Have you ever missed a penalty?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Errr in the match or in training?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> In training, no in the match?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> In the match no.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> I think I gotta say for somebody so young \u2026 for you to pick the ball up and say I'm taking this knowing that the league's on the line there you must have \u2026 there's some courage to do that, but I'm \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No, why?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Why? Because if it was any \u2026 a mere mortal like the rest of us \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah but if it's me I go to the concert and I start to sing I cannot even talk because I'm shy \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> See I understand that but when, if I go to a concert and I can't sing I guess it's not \u2026 if I have a bad show it's not, it wouldn't have been as seismic as if you'd have missed that penalty.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah because you cannot play football so it's normal.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> How do you know I can't play football?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> You can play football?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> No [both laugh].</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No but it's because you cannot play football in the Premier League so it's normal you could feel pressure.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Were the other players happy to let you take that penalty, or did \u2026 did \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah because they know how I shoot like \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> So they know of course \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> When there is a free-kick on the right we know that Kolarov want to shoot because he's good so \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> OK, and you take the penalties. Another thing before we wrap up, the goal with the shoulder \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> [smiles] Ah I don't know it just came.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> That's the kind of thing that you do in the school playground, that's never been seen on an English pitch before and I have to say I was watching it, I was on tour in a catering room in Copenhagen with lots of football supporters like some on my crew are City supporters and Liverpool supporters, there might even be a Man United supporter there and everybody stood up and applauded because it was just \u2026 maybe the goal of the season for me. But those things are just instinctive you don't think you just do it?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No, because I shoot the ball and the goalkeeper he catch it and then the ball goes high and thought the ball would go out so I was under the bar I was just under, I was just here and I saw the ball coming down but I couldn't go with the head because it was too late so I just go with the shoulder.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> It's brilliant.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> What do you think as a player \u2026 obviously with all the individual awards that are given out, the golden ball and all that and the golden boot and all that, what do you think individually as a player you'd like to achieve when you finally hang up your boots and jet back to the planet where you came from?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> So what do I want to win before I finish football?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Yeah well obviously you want to win trophies but how far do you think you can go in the game do you think you can eventually be the best player in the world? Would you like to be the best player in the world?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> I would like to yeah, but it's not only something that you would like it's something that you have to work for.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Totally. I think \u2026 mean I don't know what it's like but I think you're underneath the right manager to achieve that \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> What?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> I think you're working for the right manager if you want to be the best player in the world.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> And it's said that you're quite a shy retiring young lad, would you say that's true?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> What's retiring?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Well you know what shy means, retiring is like you like to keep yourself to yourself \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yes, a lot, I don't like when people talk about my business or my life and I like to be \u2026 I'm really private.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> I can see that \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> So maybe someone thinks I'm arrogant or something but it's just me I'm \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Do you know what I think it is that, it's a British thing with the British press is if they don't understand people \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> They never understand people \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> No no but if, people like yourself who \u2026 you know \u2026 the average Premiership footballer is not like you do you know what I mean?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Who?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Just any footballer, like I don't know any footballer \u2026 you're kind of unique in the game of football at the moment and I think that the British media are \u2026 if they don't understand somebody they just think well we have to find out what makes this person tick and that's where all the stories come from but you shouldn't get too upset about it because they do it to everybody \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> They do it to everybody?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Oh yeah, like all the great people \u2026 like me and you we always get stick from the press \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah but that's normal, but just \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Did you get that in Italy at all?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah of course, but \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> And how do you deal with it , do you just choose not to \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> I don't care because they can say what they want but me I'm a footballer so the most important moment is on Sunday on the pitch, after that they're totally different.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Correct, absolutely.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Ao they just say a lot of stuff about me, but they're just lying, they don't even know. You know if I go in the street one guy gets the picture, then they say \"oh Mario was there\" then they, someone call the press and say Mario is there, so the day after Mario was there, that's normal isn't it. Why? Because I just walk in town in town normal, like a normal guy and I go to the pub, just normal.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> You go to the pub?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> I've been to the pub yeah. Not to drink, but just to \u2026</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> To play darts?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No [both laugh]</p> <p>[Direction \u2013 Mario any questions for Noel?]</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Why do you like me?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> I speak for all \u2026 well me personally there's just \u2026 there isn't that many footballers that you see \u2026 I've supported this club all my life \u2026 there isn't that many footballers that you see that when they get the ball they make you sit forward on your seat, very rare. You see, you get that and very rare we've had it at this club. But it's the little things \u2026</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> That make you what?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Well say we're all sat at the match and we're watching football \u2026 when a player like you gets the ball everybody gets to the edge of their seat because you know something special could happen. But it's the little things that we love you for it's like the magic tricks and stealing Ag\u00fcero's gloves and the goal with the shoulder and the T-shirt celebration and it goes without saying you're a great footballer and I believe that truly over the next decade you'll be a truly great footballer, but it's footballers in general in this country, they're quite boring and dull and \u2026 I love you because you're Balotelli and you make me smile.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> [laughs]</p> <p>[They shake hands]</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> Where did you get your ring from?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> The ring? I got it in a shop in Japan, it's like when you're American and you leave college you get a ring like this. Do you get that in Italy?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> No we don't get it in England either, but yeah there you go. I would say I'd swap it you for the T-shirt.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> What T-shirt?</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Why always me?</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> No I'll give you the T-shirt no problem.</p> <p><strong>NG:</strong> Brilliant, that's twice he's said that now.</p> <p><strong>MB:</strong> You make me say it [both laugh].</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17303609\" title=\"\"><em>Watch the whole interview on Football Focus at 12.15pm on BBC1 and BBC1 HD</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

Balotelli played under Mourinho at Internazionale from 2008 to 2010 and the former Chelsea coach warned Manchester City against signing the Italian two years ago. Asked why Mourinho does not believe in him Balotelli said: \"That's his problem. They say he wants to come here [to be the manager]? But me, with Mourinho? He's a great manager but he didn't understand me so he said that nobody can understand me. But I think the only one that cannot understand me is him, so it's his problem.\" City lead Manchester United by two points and the 21-year-old believes Roberto Mancini's side should win the title as the reward for playing the better football. In an interview with the Oasis songwriter and City fan Noel Gallagher, to be shown on Football Focus on Saturday, Balotelli says: \"If you ask me if we deserve to win, if we keep playing like that then yes we deserve it. It's unlucky to say before that we will.\" Balotelli also believes that there is no problem with Carlos Tevez playing again for City following his falling out with Mancini for refusing to warm-up in a Champions League game at Bayern Munich in September. \"He looks happy. I don't know [what happened] when he didn't play, I don't know, I wasn't there so I don't really know what happened but I think everyone can do a mistake,\" the forward said. \"Carlos is part of the team so everyone wants to have fun with him, he's part of the team so everybody loves him. That's why he's happy. \"Because like me, if I'm happy in Manchester now, it's for the team for my team-mates how they are with me and for supporters, that's the good of this club.\" Balotelli urged fans to welcome the Argentinian back. \"Supporters have to be like they were before,\" he said. \"They shouldn't care [about what happened] because Carlos can hear and if they do or if they make pressure on Carlos they make pressure to all the team so they shouldn't do nothing.\" On the eve of the derby with United in October, which City won 6-1 and in which Balotelli scored twice, his colourful personal had been illustrated when the fire brigade were called to his house due to an accident with fireworks. \"It started like a joke,\" he said. \"I was bored, I was with my friends, and one of them was limping so I got one bin, a metal one, to put fireworks inside. So I left the room and I left the fireworks but I didn't light them. I walked out and then my friends go in the room and they just start screaming: 'Blah blah blah'. And the fireworks were going off and they put the fireworks on the bed, not on the bed, sorry on the toilet. But just the curtain caught on fire. That's it, nothing else. The firemen [only] came for the curtain and the toilet. Just the toilet was lost.\" After scoring against United in that derby Balotelli revealed a T-shirt with the legend: 'Why Always me?' Asked if he prepared this in anticipation of claiming a goal he said: \"I thought I was going to score three. The T-shirt was just a message. It's not a question, that people do to me, it's a question that I do to them. It was to all the people that talk bad about me and say stuff not nice and they don't know me so [I was] asking: 'Why always me, like, why always me?'\" While Balotelli stated some of the urban myths about him were untrue, including those claiming he dressed up as Santa Claus, gave \u00a31,000 to a tramp, and bought everyone in a pub in Wythenshawe a drink, he did confirm welcoming a magician back to his house. \"I was in the Trafford Centre [in Manchester], so I say to him: 'Listen I invite you to my house so you can teach me.' And he say: 'OK.' Balotelli added that Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the Brazilian Ronaldo were two of his favourite players but admitted he had not heard of City before joining. \"No, nothing.

      "bodyText": "'If you want to do well\", Virginia Bottomley told a conference at Inclusive Employers this week, \"do not do your own ironing, do not bake a cake. Women do well in India because of domestic help\". This was a conversation about how to get women into boardrooms, but there's an inevitable follow-up question, isn't there? What about the domestic help? Do they do well? A spokesperson from Unison told me: \"Look, people who do these jobs often don't have a choice, their job prospects are zero, they've got no rights, they've got no protection, most of them don't get any kind of holiday pay or sickness pay. It's simply not good enough to say that's the way for women to get out and work.\" This has been the liberal's dilemma for some time now: is it OK to sub-contract all your domestic work? Obviously, from a Marxist point of view, it isn't \u2013 we all make mess, we all have to eat, we all have to look after children if we have them. When some of us refuse to do any of that ourselves, others among us will end up doing all of it. And this has wider ramifications than just some people having to do a lot of mopping; cleaning and childcare have very low status in this society and, I'm sure, many others. Catherine Spencer is 41, has a degree, and used to manage 200 people. She now cleans her local primary school. \"There's a governors' meeting \u2013 they were coming in as I was leaving this evening,\" she says. \"They see me in my little sky-blue tabard and they immediately think of me as a complete idiot. It amuses me, but I can see that someone else would be deeply offended.\" Elodie Guttierez, 38, is a nanny \u2013 she is actually my nanny, and we'll come to this later \u2013 and she concurs: \"If you've got a group of people talking about what they do, when you say you're a nanny, nobody asks you anything. They think, 'Poor her, she's just a stupid girl.' A guy in the Groucho actually turned his back on me when I told him what I did.\" This delegation of labour is not consequence-free, in other words. On one side, the modern urban life is shaped by a particular economic view in which your work is a huge part of your identity. This credo of fulfilment by industry is actually not very realistic \u2013 it isn't as stark as the idea that preceded it, historically speaking, where your worth was determined by your wealth and breeding. But in its way, it's just as exclusive \u2013 in a world that believes your worth is your work, a lot of people aren't going to feel very valuable. Second, there is this peculiarly low status accorded to household chores. Adam Smith's classic explanation was: how can you respect work that, once it's done, instantly needs doing again? As he put it, \"menial tasks and services \u2026 generally perish in the instant of their performance and seldom leave any trace or value behind them\". But that doesn't quite do it for me \u2013 office cleaners do the same job, and may be held in the same low regard. But there isn't the taint of shame. The novelist and poet Kate Clanchy wrote a book, Antigona and Me, about her Kosovan cleaner, and someone (a childless person; I think this is relevant) said to her: \"I would never have a cleaner.\" She remembers replying \"But you do! Who cleans your office?\" Personally, I think the problem is a background belief that household work is women's work \u2013 it's shameful because we're outsourcing not just our laundry, but the building blocks of our femininity. And there's always some reason why the work of women is outside calculable value. If it's dusting, it's too trivial and evanescent for money; if it's giving birth, it's too important and lasting. It might be a systematic attempt, since the dawn of money as the unit of exchange, to keep women from having any independent agency in the market. Or it might be a coincidence. Leaving the feminist dimension aside for a second, this presents a problem, doesn't it? When, in the act of employing someone, you erode their standing in the world, that's quite a complicated relationship. Stella McCartney told The Sunday Times Style magazine this week: \"I have a housekeeper and a nanny, although I find that word jarring. I tell her, 'I just want to call you a friend.'\" That's a typically nice-person response \u2013 she finds the word jarring because of the chasm of status it implies. But changing the word is insufficient. The chasm still exists; when someone at the Groucho asks her housekeeper what she does for a living, she's not going to reply: \"I'm Stella McCartney's friend.\" There are less nice people who deal with this discomfort by simply pretending the person doesn't exist. Eye-contact crops up again and again: Helen, a 37-year-old PhD student who cleaned for people when she was doing her BA, tells me about a woman who used to hold out the bin bag and not meet her eye. Someone else she worked for left her Filofax on the side one day: \"And I thought, 'I wonder what section she's put me in?' Am I under H, for my name, or am I under C for cleaner? And I was under C for cleaner. I was so offended. I don't know why, but in the context of how she was treating me overall, it was as though I was less than human.\" There's obviously something very difficult about employing another human for work that is private \u2013 so employers attempt either to play down the employment, a la McCartney, or play down the human. Or there's a third way, which is to recast the domestic worker as someone with a very specific skill, which might not be very high-status but nevertheless isn't universal, so it's not something you could do yourself \u2013 like a ratcatcher or a handyman. For her book, The New Maids \u2013 Transnational Women and the Care Economy, Helma Lutz interviewed both cleaners and employers, and noted dryly: \"Employers like to see their domestic workers as service providers; it is largely a form of exculpatory rhetoric which conveniently diverts the debate away from relations of power and dependence, since the (academically) educated upper-middle-class clients will usually know that they are not party to a legally safeguarded service-provider contract.\" People used to deal better with the political hazards of all this: my mother and father were with a cleaning agency in the late 50s, which specifically signed up people such as art students and unemployed actors \u2013 almost all men \u2013 so that you could get your cleaning done by someone who might need the money, but was part of the bohemian class, as well as the male hegemony. The act of picking up your pants wouldn't disturb their place in the world, or sense of themselves. My parents worked for a couple who probably would have done their own cleaning, except that they were also fighting South African apartheid. I mean, if you want to be a liberal but you hate washing up, you can't get much more copper-bottomed than that. However, here the bonds between Marxist theory and socially responsible practice really break down: if you're so squeamish about the relations of power and dependence that you will only employ people in or above your own class, that, to the untrained eye, will look a lot like open snobbery. What if there's a working-class person or a migrant or a single mother who is prepared to overlook the status anxiety because they could really do with the money? Are you still going to stick to your out-of-work actors agency then? I feel theoretically guilty about having a nanny, but I don't actually feel guilty. This is partly because Elodie is framed in my mind as a \"service-provider\"; that is, she does it because she's better at it than I am. This is demonstrably true, and furthermore, anybody who thinks childcare is \"menial\" and therefore isn't extremely demanding intellectually, physically and emotionally simply hasn't done enough of it. Naturally, though, if I didn't have a job I'd just have to get better at it. So there's some exculpatory rhetoric going on there. But there's also a feminist point \u2013 I don't see why it should be me outsourcing my maternal duties. We're delegating our parental duties as a family, and if I were to accept that all the guilt and shame from that act are mine, I would be effectively rolling back the crucial point of feminism: that we're as well suited to the workplace, and ill-suited to the home, in any proportion, as any given man. Cleaners are a bit different \u2013 the \"service provider\" case is hard to make, since even if you are useless at it, you're presumably good enough to uphold your own standards. And it is boring; you can't pretend to think someone else is feeling fulfilled by it. But the feminist case is even stronger here. Considering the huge advances made by women in the workplace, perhaps not with boardroom representation, but certainly with equal pay, it is astonishing that so little progress has been made domestically. The British Household Panel Survey looked at 5,000 families over 15 years and found that single men do four hours of housework a week, while single women do seven hours. But married and cohabiting women do 12 hours a week, and men suddenly do 40 minutes. This is not just about women having higher standards, in other words (I know I don't); it is about a resolute failure to import principles of equality into the home. Many of us have commissioned out the conflict to someone in a (possibly metaphorical) sky-blue tabard. The overwhelming downside of all this vexed morality and shame is that the entire business is chased underground and cleaners are treated appallingly. This is particularly the case when they're migrants, especially those whose immigration status is uncertain. Two of the most lingering details of the rape accusation made against Dominique Strauss Kahn in New York last year were these: firstly, while the case collapsed for a number of reasons, the fact the alleged victim didn't have proper residency especially harmed her credibility, certainly in the trial-by-media; uncertain immigration status redounds unimaginably badly upon your rights as an employee, and as a human being. Secondly, when fellow maids held a rally in New York, their stories threw up a snapshot of the contempt in which they are held. One woman remembered a hotel guest who'd put the \"make up my room\" sign up, but was sitting naked on a chair when she walked in. A study in 2003 found there are European estimates that one in four domestic workers is employed illegally. A report on socio-economic conditions in Germany found that \"the private household is by far the sector with the highest proportion of unprotected, illegal employment\" \u2013 and there's no reason, certainly no regulation, to make us think the UK is any different. People think of cash-in-hand work as getting one over on the tax man; domestic labour is an illustration of the fact that, when you are employed outside the legitimate tax system, the overwhelming likelihood is that someone else is getting one over on you. You're outside minimum-wage legislation, you have no job security, you have no holiday or sick pay; someone I knew whose cleaner came on a Monday used to discharge her without payment on bank holidays. Her rationale was that the cleaner didn't pay national insurance contributions, so why should she get the benefit? It did not even occur to her that she wasn't paying employer contributions, either. Helma Lutz pans out to form a fascinating historical trajectory of domestic service \u2013 from a serf class three centuries ago, through the \"professionalisation\" of service two centuries ago when unions introduced some basic rights, contracts, days off, that kind of thing. After that, in the late-19th and early- to mid-20th centuries, men's wives became all the domestic help they needed; and finally, the emancipation of women has taken domestic work back, not to that professionalised era, but to the era before it, when workers had no rights, no contracts under law, no career progression and no public visibility. Lutz wonders whether this amounts to a \"refeudalization\". In short, the first thing to do is to break the embarrassment of domestic help down into its constituent parts: it is one thing having a cleaner and feeling embarrassed about it, because you should be doing it yourself; it is another thing having a cleaner and feeling ashamed because you offer no job security and no holiday pay and no contractual equity of any sort. It's all a bit of a fail, but you can always fail better.",

      "body": "<p>'If you want to do well\", Virginia Bottomley told a conference at Inclusive Employers this week, \"do not do your own ironing, do not bake a cake. Women do&#xa0;well in India because of domestic help\".</p> <p>This was a conversation about how to get women into boardrooms, but there's an inevitable follow-up question, isn't there? What about the domestic help? Do they do well?</p> <p>A spokesperson from Unison told me:&#xa0;\"Look, people who do these jobs often don't have a choice, their job prospects are zero, they've got no rights,&#xa0;they've got no protection, most of them don't get any kind of holiday pay or sickness pay. It's simply not good&#xa0;enough to say that's the way for women to get out and work.\"</p> <p>This has been the liberal's dilemma for some time now: is it OK to sub-contract all your domestic work? Obviously, from a Marxist point of view, it isn't \u2013 we all make mess, we all have to&#xa0;eat, we all have to look after children if we have them. When some of us refuse to do any of that ourselves, others among us will end up doing all of&#xa0;it. And this has wider ramifications than just some people having to do a lot&#xa0;of mopping; cleaning and childcare have very low status in this society and, I'm sure, many others.</p> <p>Catherine Spencer is 41, has a degree, and used to manage 200 people. She now cleans her local primary school. \"There's a governors' meeting \u2013 they were coming in as I was leaving this evening,\" she says. \"They see me in my&#xa0;little sky-blue tabard and they immediately think of me as a complete idiot. It amuses me, but I can see that&#xa0;someone else would be deeply offended.\" Elodie Guttierez, 38, is a nanny \u2013 she is actually my nanny, and&#xa0;we'll come to this later \u2013 and she concurs: \"If you've got a group of people talking about what they do, when you say you're a nanny, nobody asks you anything. They think, 'Poor her, she's just a stupid girl.' A guy in the Groucho actually turned his back on me when I&#xa0;told him what I did.\"</p> <p>This delegation of labour is not consequence-free, in other words. On&#xa0;one side, the modern urban life is shaped by a particular economic view in&#xa0;which your work is a huge part of your identity. This credo of fulfilment by industry is actually not very realistic \u2013 it isn't as stark as&#xa0;the idea that preceded it, historically speaking, where your worth was determined by your wealth and breeding. But in its way, it's just as exclusive \u2013 in a world that believes your worth is your work, a lot of people aren't going to feel very valuable. Second, there is&#xa0;this peculiarly low status accorded to household chores.</p> <p>Adam Smith's classic explanation was: how can you respect work that, once it's done, instantly needs doing again? As he put it, \"menial tasks and services \u2026 generally perish in the instant of their performance and seldom leave any trace or value behind them\". But that doesn't quite do it for me \u2013 office cleaners do the same job, and may be held in the same low regard. But there isn't the taint of shame. The novelist and poet Kate Clanchy wrote a&#xa0;book, Antigona and Me, about her Kosovan cleaner, and someone (a childless person; I think this is relevant) said to her: \"I would never have a cleaner.\" She remembers replying \"But you do! Who cleans your office?\"</p> <p>Personally, I think the problem is a background belief that household work is women's work \u2013 it's shameful because we're outsourcing not just our laundry, but the building blocks of our femininity. And there's always some reason why the work of&#xa0;women is outside calculable value. If it's dusting, it's too trivial and evanescent for money; if it's giving birth, it's too important and lasting. It&#xa0;might be a systematic attempt, since&#xa0;the dawn of money as the unit of exchange, to keep women from having any independent agency in the market. Or it might be a coincidence.</p> <p>Leaving the feminist dimension aside&#xa0;for a second, this presents a problem, doesn't it? When, in the act of&#xa0;employing someone, you erode their&#xa0;standing in the world, that's quite&#xa0;a complicated relationship. Stella McCartney told The Sunday Times Style&#xa0;magazine this week: \"I have a housekeeper and a nanny, although I&#xa0;find that word jarring. I tell her, 'I just want to call you a friend.'\" That's a typically nice-person response \u2013 she finds the word jarring because of the chasm of status it implies. But changing the word is insufficient. The chasm still exists; when someone at the Groucho asks her housekeeper what she does for&#xa0;a living, she's not going to reply: \"I'm&#xa0;Stella McCartney's friend.\"</p> <p>There are less nice people who deal with this discomfort by simply pretending the person doesn't exist. Eye-contact crops up again and again: Helen, a 37-year-old PhD student who cleaned for people when she was doing her BA, tells me about a woman who used to hold out the bin bag and not meet her eye. Someone else she worked for left her Filofax on the side one day: \"And I&#xa0;thought, 'I wonder what section she's put me in?' Am I under H, for my name, or am I under C for cleaner? And I was under C for cleaner. I was so offended. I&#xa0;don't know why, but in the context of&#xa0;how she was treating me overall, it was as though I was less than human.\" There's obviously something very difficult about employing another human for work that is private \u2013 so employers attempt either to play down the employment, a la McCartney, or play&#xa0;down the human.</p> <p>Or there's a third way, which is to recast the domestic worker as someone with a very specific skill, which might not be very high-status but nevertheless isn't universal, so it's not something you could do yourself \u2013 like a ratcatcher or a handyman. For her book, The New Maids \u2013 Transnational Women and the Care Economy, Helma Lutz interviewed both cleaners and employers, and noted dryly: \"Employers like to see their domestic workers as service providers; it is largely a form of exculpatory rhetoric which conveniently diverts the&#xa0;debate away from relations of power&#xa0;and dependence, since the (academically) educated upper-middle-class clients will usually know that they are not party to a legally safeguarded service-provider contract.\"</p> <p>People used to deal better with the political hazards of all this: my mother and father were with a cleaning agency in the late 50s, which specifically signed&#xa0;up people such as art students and unemployed actors \u2013 almost all men \u2013 so&#xa0;that you could get your cleaning done by someone who might need the money, but was part of the bohemian class, as well as the male hegemony. The&#xa0;act of picking up your pants wouldn't disturb their place in the world, or sense of themselves. My parents worked for a couple who probably would have done their own cleaning, except that they were also fighting South African apartheid. I&#xa0;mean, if you want to be a liberal but you hate washing up, you can't get much more copper-bottomed than that.&#xa0;However, here the bonds between Marxist theory and socially responsible practice really break down: if you're so squeamish about the relations of power and dependence that you will only employ people in or above your own class, that, to the untrained eye, will look a lot like open snobbery. What if there's a working-class person or a migrant or a single mother who is prepared to overlook the status anxiety because they could really do with the money? Are you still going to stick to your out-of-work actors agency then?</p> <p>I feel theoretically guilty about having a nanny, but I don't actually feel guilty. This is partly because Elodie is framed in&#xa0;my mind as a \"service-provider\"; that is, she does it because she's better at it than I am. This is demonstrably true, and furthermore, anybody who thinks childcare is \"menial\" and therefore isn't extremely demanding intellectually, physically and emotionally simply hasn't done enough of it. Naturally, though, if I didn't have a job I'd just have to get better at it. So there's some exculpatory rhetoric going on there.</p> <p>But there's also a feminist point \u2013 I&#xa0;don't see why it should be me outsourcing my maternal duties. We're&#xa0;delegating our parental duties as&#xa0;a&#xa0;family, and if I were to accept that all the guilt and shame from that act are&#xa0;mine, I would be effectively rolling back&#xa0;the crucial point of feminism: that we're as well suited to the workplace, and ill-suited to the home, in any proportion, as any given man. Cleaners&#xa0;are a bit different \u2013 the \"service provider\" case is hard to make, since even if you are useless at it, you're presumably good enough to uphold your own standards. And it is boring; you can't pretend to think someone else is feeling fulfilled by it. But the feminist case is even stronger here. Considering the huge advances made by women in&#xa0;the workplace, perhaps not with boardroom representation, but certainly with equal pay, it is astonishing that so&#xa0;little progress has been made domestically. The British Household Panel Survey looked at 5,000 families over 15 years and found that single men do four hours of housework a week, while single women do seven hours. But&#xa0;married and cohabiting women do&#xa0;12 hours a week, and men suddenly do 40 minutes. This is not just about women having higher standards, in other words (I know I don't); it is about a&#xa0;resolute failure to import principles of&#xa0;equality into the home. Many of us have commissioned out the conflict to someone in a (possibly metaphorical) sky-blue tabard.</p> <p>The overwhelming downside of all&#xa0;this vexed morality and shame is&#xa0;that&#xa0;the entire business is chased underground and cleaners are treated appallingly.

      "bodyText": "BBC 6 Music which faced the axe two years ago celebrates its 10th anniversary on Sunday, and will mark the decade next Friday with an event at London's Southbank Centre. The celebration which features Laura Marling, Public Image Limited, De La Soul and Blur's Graham Coxon, finds the digital radio station in relatively rude health, its listener figures put at nearly 1.5m, double what it was achieving in February 2010, when the BBC proposed to close the station, a decision that was revoked by the trust five months later. Indeed, so successful was the campaign to save it \u2013 which involved protests by listeners and the arrival at the BBC of a deputation from the British Phonographic Industry headed by the former EMI boss Tony Wadsworth \u2013 that some felt the closure had been manufactured as a publicity stunt. \"A lot of people think it wasn't going to close, but it really was,\" says Lauren Laverne, whose mid-morning show broke the news of the reprieve, playing Lambchop's Up With People to celebrate. \"It was a horrible time. I don't think any of us thought we'd be reprieved. My producer did, but he's the world's most ridiculous optimist. I was sure that was it.\" Even so, there is a sense that the threat of closure was the best thing that happened to 6 Music, and not merely because it raised awareness of its existence among a public who seem to have liked what they heard and stuck around. Its controller Bob Shennan says it galvanised a station with a turbulent and muddled history: as presenter Stuart Maconie notes wryly, \"there's nothing like the threat of imminent closure to focus the mind\". Launched with the vague and spirit-sapping remit of \"archive and album tracks\", it struggled to find an identity and a listenership. \"Nobody knew what it was or where it was. It was a step into the unknown,\" says Gideon Coe, a 6 Music DJ since the launch, who remembers presenters having to be given digital radios so that they could listen to the station they worked for. \"You'd hear some people going, it's a station that falls between Radio 1 and Radio 2 and other people going, no, that's not what it is at all. There was confusion and the figures were pitifully low.\" In an attempt to snare more female listeners, the former controller Lesley Douglas appointed TV presenter George Lamb as mid-morning DJ \u2013 the comic Viz subsequently ran a cartoon strip comparing Lamb to a character called Terry Fuckwitt, whose brain had been removed and replaced with a piece of dog excrement \u2013 with Douglas stoked further controversy by claiming that women would enjoy Lamb's show because of his \"less intellectual approach\". Today, devotees would claim that the Southbank line-up barely scratches the surface of 6 Music's eclecticism, particularly with the spirit ofMaconie's Freak Zone, a bold attempt to subject Sunday teatime listeners to what Maconie describes as \"records no other radio show would play \u2013 free jazz, prog rock, electronica, novelty records, soundtracks\". It's the kind of show that would have been lost, Maconie thinks, had the station closed, despite the BBC commission's belief that 6 Music was occupying territory that commercial radio stations were already covering:. \"You could put it out as a podcast, or have me broadcasting it pirate-radio style from the top of a tower block, but I don't know,\" he said. Instead its combination of affable presenting and wildly esoteric music seems to be spreading. Over the course of last Sunday, 6 Music's DJs played tracks by dubstep auteur Skream, Black Sabbath, Basic Channel, King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, the Muppets, a \"dark ambient\" track by Crosswinds called From The Bogs Of Aughiska, Roland Kirk, the Monkees and a group of traditional musicians from the Solomon Islands remixed by dub producer Manasseh. \"There's something to be said for things that aren't commercial, that are about protecting the integrity of the artistic landscape,\" says Laverne. \"That sounds pretentious \u2013 you'd never throw that into a link on the radio \u2013 but it's a sentiment behind what we do. Because we don't have to do it to the satisfaction of a sponsor and an advertiser, we have more freedom.\" But for all the increased listenership and eclectic output, 6 Music's continued existence is not something greeted with untrammelled delight. \"It's spoonfeeding a generation that don't need spoonfeeding. They can go out and find it on the internet,\" offers one industry figure, who feels the BBC's money would be better spent on the World Service than \"satisfying the cravings of middle-aged music fans\". \"There was a time when there was very little broadcast media, when John Peel was the only route to a certain type of music. \"Now, you can find an infinite amount of music on the internet and radio stations around the world. I don't think it's specialist enough to make it necessary.\" Although you could possibly apply the same argument about the internet to every music-based radio station, there remains a perception that 6 Music caters primarily to a certain kind of male listener in their late 30s, a state of affairs perhaps compounded by the number of Britpop-era pop stars on the presenters' roster: Cerys Matthews, Jarvis Cocker, Laverne, Fun Lovin' Criminals' Huey Morgan. It's perhaps worth noting that every 6 Music presenter contacted for this piece felt it necessary to dispel that view, without prompting. \"I think some people think it's all indie guitar music which it isn't,\" offers Maconie. Those who protested about its closure, he says, \"were different kind of people to the ones everyone had thought. It wasn't just a few blokey music obsessives sitting atop teetering piles of old Sounds and Melody Makers from the 70s and 80s. There were a lot of women. There were a lot of ordinary people who just wanted something a bit different from their music and their presenters.\" Certainly, everyone concerned seems buoyant about 6 Music's future: the jazz and dance DJ Gilles Peterson is about to join \"broadcasting during daylight hours\", notes Shennan, \"which I'm sure will come as a shock to his system\". Coe said: \"It's got to square the circle between being adventurous and esoteric and appealing to enough listeners to justify its existence. \"But if 6 Music didn't exist, a lot of music would be lost. Not just new stuff, old things as well. I can't see anyone else playing Container Drivers by the Fall.\"",

      "body": "<p>BBC 6 Music which faced the axe two years ago celebrates its 10th anniversary on Sunday, and will mark the decade next Friday with an event at London's Southbank Centre.</p> <p>The celebration which features Laura Marling, Public Image Limited, De La Soul and Blur's Graham Coxon, finds the digital radio station in relatively rude health, its listener figures put at nearly 1.5m, double what it was achieving in February 2010, when the BBC proposed to close the station, a decision that was revoked by the trust five months later.</p> <p>Indeed, so successful was the campaign to save it \u2013 which involved protests by listeners and the arrival at the BBC of a deputation from the British Phonographic Industry headed by the former EMI boss Tony Wadsworth \u2013 that some felt the closure had been manufactured as a publicity stunt.</p> <p>\"A lot of people think it wasn't going to close, but it really was,\" says Lauren Laverne, whose mid-morning show broke the news of the reprieve, playing Lambchop's Up With People to celebrate. \"It was a horrible time. I don't think any of us thought we'd be reprieved. My producer did, but he's the world's most ridiculous optimist. I was sure that was it.\"</p> <p>Even so, there is a sense that the threat of closure was the best thing that happened to 6 Music, and not merely because it raised awareness of its existence among a public who seem to have liked what they heard and stuck around.</p> <p>Its controller Bob Shennan says it galvanised a station with a turbulent and muddled history: as presenter Stuart Maconie notes wryly, \"there's nothing like the threat of imminent closure to focus the mind\".</p> <p>Launched with the vague and spirit-sapping remit of \"archive and album tracks\", it struggled to find an identity and a listenership.</p> <p>\"Nobody knew what it was or where it was. It was a step into the unknown,\" says Gideon Coe, a 6 Music DJ since the launch, who remembers presenters having to be given digital radios so that they could listen to the station they worked for. \"You'd hear some people going, it's a station that falls between Radio 1 and Radio 2 and other people going, no, that's not what it is at all. There was confusion and the figures were pitifully low.\"</p> <p>In an attempt to snare more female listeners, the former controller Lesley Douglas appointed TV presenter George Lamb as mid-morning DJ \u2013 the comic Viz subsequently ran a cartoon strip comparing Lamb to a character called Terry Fuckwitt, whose brain had been removed and replaced with a piece of dog excrement \u2013 with Douglas stoked further controversy by claiming that women would enjoy Lamb's show because of his \"less intellectual approach\".</p> <p>Today, devotees would claim that the Southbank line-up barely scratches the surface of 6 Music's eclecticism, particularly with the spirit ofMaconie's Freak Zone, a bold attempt to subject Sunday teatime listeners to what Maconie describes as \"records no other radio show would play \u2013 free jazz, prog rock, electronica, novelty records, soundtracks\".</p> <p>It's the kind of show that would have been lost, Maconie thinks, had the station closed, despite the BBC commission's belief that 6 Music was occupying territory that commercial radio stations were already covering:. \"You could put it out as a podcast, or have me broadcasting it pirate-radio style from the top of a tower block, but I don't know,\" he said.</p> <p>Instead its combination of affable presenting and wildly esoteric music seems to be spreading.</p> <p>Over the course of last Sunday, 6 Music's DJs played tracks by dubstep auteur Skream, Black Sabbath, Basic Channel, King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, the Muppets, a \"dark ambient\" track by Crosswinds called From The Bogs Of Aughiska, Roland Kirk, the Monkees and a group of traditional musicians from the Solomon Islands remixed by dub producer Manasseh.</p> <p>\"There's something to be said for things that aren't commercial, that are about protecting the integrity of the artistic landscape,\" says Laverne. \"That sounds pretentious \u2013 you'd never throw that into a link on the radio \u2013 but it's a sentiment behind what we do. Because we don't have to do it to the satisfaction of a sponsor and an advertiser, we have more freedom.\"</p> <p>But for all the increased listenership and eclectic output, 6 Music's continued existence is not something greeted with untrammelled delight.</p> <p>\"It's spoonfeeding a generation that don't need spoonfeeding. They can go out and find it on the internet,\" offers one industry figure, who feels the BBC's money would be better spent on the World Service than \"satisfying the cravings of middle-aged music fans\".</p> <p>\"There was a time when there was very little broadcast media, when John Peel was the only route to a certain type of music.</p> <p>\"Now, you can find an infinite amount of music on the internet and radio stations around the world. I don't think it's specialist enough to make it necessary.\"</p> <p>Although you could possibly apply the same argument about the internet to every music-based radio station, there remains a perception that 6 Music caters primarily to a certain kind of male listener in their late 30s, a state of affairs perhaps compounded by the number of Britpop-era pop stars on the presenters' roster: Cerys Matthews, Jarvis Cocker, Laverne, Fun Lovin' Criminals' Huey Morgan.</p> <p>It's perhaps worth noting that every 6 Music presenter contacted for this piece felt it necessary to dispel that view, without prompting. \"I think some people think it's all indie guitar music which it isn't,\" offers Maconie.</p> <p>Those who protested about its closure, he says, \"were different kind of people to the ones everyone had thought.</p> <p>It wasn't just a few blokey music obsessives sitting atop teetering piles of old Sounds and Melody Makers from the 70s and 80s. There were a lot of women. There were a lot of ordinary people who just wanted something a bit different from their music and their presenters.\"</p> <p>Certainly, everyone concerned seems buoyant about 6 Music's future: the jazz and dance DJ Gilles Peterson is about to join \"broadcasting during daylight hours\", notes Shennan, \"which I'm sure will come as a shock to his system\".</p> <p>Coe said: \"It's got to square the circle between being adventurous and esoteric and appealing to enough listeners to justify its existence.</p> <p>\"But if 6 Music didn't exist, a lot of music would be lost. Not just new stuff, old things as well. I can't see anyone else playing Container Drivers by the Fall.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Master And The Margarita, London The return of the superb Complicite to the Barbican is always a cause for joy. Following Shun-kin and A Disappearing Number, Simon McBurney's company offers an adapation of the cult Soviet novel The Master And Margarita, the complex plotting of which is dominated by the figure of the Devil, who wreaks havoc as a professor of black magic in Stalinist Russia. Written by Mikhail Bulgakov (being played by Alex Jennings in Collaborators at the National) in the years before his death in 1940, and only published in 1967, the vivid characters alone should provide plenty for Complicite's innovative style to feast on. Barbican Theatre, EC2, Thu to 7 Apr Mark Cook Buzzcut, Glasgow The sudden, sad loss of New Territories and Into The New was a major setback for Scottish theatre, but Buzzcut \u2013 a new artist-led festival with a pay-what-you-can policy \u2013 aims to fill the gap. There's plenty to tempt, with work such as Sarah Hopfinger's new show These Age-old Present Memories, exploring ageing (Wed), and Thom Scullion's Play [Station] (Wed &amp; Fri), which invites the public to help him complete the videogame that defeated him as a child. Put together at short notice, the festival is a tribute to New Territories' radical tradition. The Old Hairdressers and The Glue Factory, Wed to 18 Mar Lyn Gardner Moon On A Rainbow Shawl, London A Caribbean classic comes to the National this week. Moon On A Rainbow Shawl was written in 1953 by actor-playwright Errol John who, like one of his aspiring characters, had come to the UK from Trinidad two years previously. In this slice of Trinidad, life teems as troops return from the second world war, neighbours drink, brawl and judge, and others dream of a better life. The cast includes Jude Akuwudike, Jenny Jules and Danny Sapani. National Theatre: Cottesloe, SE1, to 9 Jun MC Hound Of The Baskervilles, Huddersfield Sherlock Holmes is very much back in fashion courtesy of the TV series with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, so this version of one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous Holmes and Watson stories may well hit the box office jackpot, whether in Huddersfield or on its subsequent English tour. It's a terrific Victorian yarn about the debauchery of the aristocracy and the demonic hell hound sent to punish the wickedness of the Baskerville family. What makes this production particularly interesting however is the involvement of Imitating The Dog, a contemporary theatre company whose astonishing visual flair and trickery is likely to be put to good use here. Lawrence Batley Theatre, Mon to 17 Mar, touring to 19 May LG Anne Boleyn, Cambridge After two runs at the Globe, it's great to see Howard Brenton's seriously enjoyable and intelligent play going out on tour with a little help from English Touring Theatre. Religion gets unexpectedly sexy here in a show that not only offers tips on Tudor contraception but which also presents Henry VIII's second wife as a singularly shrewd woman who was not above using her charms to promote the cause of Protestantism and religious reform. This is a serious play wrapped up in a frisky historical drama as Henry attempts to get his hand above Anne's knee and she holds out for the greater prize: not just a crown but a chance to ensure the flowering of her favoured faith. It was a wonderfully warm evening when it was performed at the Globe and here's hoping that nothing is lost from the production in more traditional theatres on tour. Cambridge Arts Theatre, Thu to 17 Mar, touring to 12 May LG Gypsy, Leicester Paul Kerryson's revival of The King And I has just enjoyed a hugely successful regional tour, and now he turns his attention to another large-scale production. First performed on Broadway in 1959, this musical by Arthur Laurents, Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim was inspired by the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee and tells of Mama Rose, the original stage mother from hell, who has grand ambitions for her two daughters to become the star she wanted to be. It's got some fabulous songs, including Let Me Entertain You, but it's seldom staged because it's a big show with an even bigger central role in Mama Rose. Here it's the fine Australian actress Caroline O'Connor who gets her chance. Curve, to 15 Apr LG Birmingham Royal Ballet, London Birmingham Royal Ballet's short London season showcases three love stories, each ideal for the dancers' comic dramatic talents. Programme 1 is a double bill of Ashton ballets: his 1951 setting of Daphnis &amp; Chlo\u00eb, plus Two Pigeons \u2013 choreographed a decade later \u2013 in which sentimentality is redeemed by simple, true emotions. The second programme sees a rare outing for Peter Wright's take on Copp\u00e9lia, which finds wit and sweetness in the Hoffmann-inspired story. London Coliseum, WC2, Tue to 18 Mar Judith Mackrell Shobana Jeyasingh, London Next year, Shobanah Jeyasingh will celebrate the 25th anniversary of her company and 25 years as a pioneer in contemporary south Asian dance. Classic Cut, a double bill spanning close to 25 years, opens with Configurations, the 1988 work with Michael Nyman that created a hybrid of British and Indian traditions. With new lighting by Lucy Carter, this version has been revised to accelerate the speed and detail of the original. Jeyasingh's new work, Dev Kahan Hai?/Where Is Dev?, by contrast, uses Bollywood samples and returns Jeyasingh to the formal storytelling roots of classical Asian dance.

First performed on Broadway in 1959, this musical by Arthur Laurents, Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim was inspired by the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee and tells of Mama Rose, the original stage mother from hell, who has grand ambitions for her two daughters to become the star she wanted to be. It's got some fabulous songs, including Let Me Entertain You, but it's seldom staged because it's a big show with an even bigger central role in Mama Rose. Here it's the fine Australian actress Caroline O'Connor who gets her chance.</p> <p><strong><em>Curve, to 15 Apr</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Birmingham Royal Ballet, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387096987\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/8/1331226374062/Coppelia-004.jpg\" alt=\"Coppelia\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coppelia.

Programme 1 is a double bill of Ashton ballets: his 1951 setting of Daphnis &amp; Chlo\u00eb, plus Two Pigeons \u2013 choreographed a decade later \u2013 in which sentimentality is redeemed by simple, true emotions. The second programme sees a rare outing for Peter Wright's take on Copp\u00e9lia, which finds wit and sweetness in the Hoffmann-inspired story.</p> <p><strong><em>London Coliseum, WC2, Tue to 18 Mar</em></strong></p> <p><em>Judith Mackrell</em></p> <h2>Shobana Jeyasingh, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387096988\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/8/1331226422155/Classic-Cut-002.jpg\" alt=\"Classic Cut\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Classic Cut.

With new lighting by Lucy Carter, this version has been revised to accelerate the speed and detail of the original. Jeyasingh's new work, Dev Kahan Hai?/Where Is Dev?, by contrast, uses Bollywood samples and returns Jeyasingh to the formal storytelling roots of classical Asian dance.</p> <p><strong><em>Linbury Studio Theatre, WC2, Tue to 17 Mar</em></strong></p> <p><em>JM</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Jean Dubuffet, London In old age the great mischief-maker Jean Dubuffet said his early works' punch was bound to the brief, historical moment it had provoked. Whether inspired by art by prisoners, children or the mentally ill to create zany images of politicians, cyclists and jazz musicians, or experimenting with concrete or butterfly wings, his paintings gave occupied and postwar Paris a jolt. This show offers insight into the last hurrah of his late years, from 1975 to 82, with previously unexhibited works from five major series. Th\u00e9\u00e2tres De M\u00e9moire, for example, sees Dubuffet create a tangled patchwork of wobbly figures from the swimming scribbles of the earlier Lieux Abr\u00e9g\u00e9s series that capture memory's jumble. By the time of his penultimate series, Mires (Sights), the scrawled people or buildings have dissolved into bright abstractions, while the final series, Non-Lieux (Cases Dismissed) is all brutal, densely worked lines. Waddington Custot Galleries, W1, to 14 Apr Skye Sherwin Minerva Cuevas, Manchester Renowned Mexican artist Minerva Cuevas uses old magic lanterns and 19th-century microscope projectors to evoke an era of almost alchemical scientific research into the workings of nature, human nature and the age-old troubled relationship between the two. It's a kind of video magic realism where humankind's desire to understand and control the wilderness of chaotic natural forces underpins our social culture. Yet nature also becomes as much a commodity to be advertised, indulged in and exploited against a backdrop of threatening extinctions. While such stuff is the basis of so much eco-concerned contemporary art, Cuevas invests it all with an air of ambivalent wonderment, as her 16mm film, Landings, takes us on a trip through the history of civilisation, into a mysterious past and uncertain future. Cornerhouse, to 25 Mar Robert Clark The Crisis Commission, London Some of the biggest names in contemporary art \u2013 including Tracey Emin, Antony Gormley and Yinka Shonibare \u2013 have contributed to this fundraising show, ending in an auction, for the homeless charity Crisis. What's more, with the exception of Sir Anthony Caro's gift, it's all new, specially commissioned work. Caro, the titan of postwar sculpture and original heavy metal boy, has donated his 1984 work Down Centre, a prone steel figure with bound feet that suggests the harshness of modern urban life. Meanwhile there's double-edged street talk rendered in neon from Emin. Further artists on the bill include cult cartoonist David Shrigley and the video artist Gillian Wearing, whose confessional portraits of ordinary folk have often taken place on the street. Somerset House, WC2, Wed to 22 Apr SS James Benning, Sunderland Veteran film-maker James Benning returns to his hometown of Milwaukee to update his highly influential 1977 work One Way Boogie Woogie. If you like your films with flashy effects, stay away from Benning's spoilsport subversions. Not much at all happens in his work, but that is the whole deadpan point. By focusing on backstreet details, Benning tricks us into an unprecedented perspective on the great American road movie. Northern Gallery For Contemporary Art, to 9 Jun RC Franz Erhard Walther, London Works such as Three Broad Bands graced conceptual art's landmark shows of the 1960s, his chums include Gerhard Richter, and he's taught the likes of Martin Kippenberger. Yet, outside Germany, Franz Erhard Walther is one of his generation's lesser-known names. Perhaps that's because, as groundbreaking as his interactive work is, it's resolutely quiet and humble. In this first UK show, a retrospective of his work is joined by his recent autobiographic graphic novel, The Dust Of Stars, an epic 500 pages of personal and public history. The Drawing Room, SE1, to 28 Apr SS Michael Day, Sheffield Michael Day's video installations are a strange mix of Romantic metaphysical alienation and the superficial connection offered by global communications. Dreamlike seascapes and mountainous landscapes are upset by blatant gadgetry. A radio mast drifts in and out of vision amid clouds and snowfall, the mast's red warning light flashing alarmingly and the sequence building a sense of loneliness. Yet, as the film fades, the viewer realises that the light is in fact a small LED inset into the projection screen. Mainstream cinema engages in entertaining reveries, but Day's work gives us an artifice that is perversely heartening. Bloc Projects, to 24 Mar RC Keith Vaughan, Chichester Originally an illustrator by trade, the Sussex-born postwar artist Keith Vaughan absorbed many lessons from the modern masters. An early painting of yellow cornfields where labourers puff pipes sings of C\u00e9zanne, the mask-like faces his nudes wear recall the cubist Picasso, while Matisse presides over the flat, rhythmic forms and colours of his later works. Vaughan's theme throughout, however, was personal. His painting of a naked man huddling in a cave might be seen in relation to Henry Moore's famous image of bodies sheltering from the Blitz in the underground. It seems less though about the violence of war than about the challenges of being gay in an era that was far from out and proud. His great subject was man, usually nude, in nature, yet his paintings play down the erotic element, seducing the viewer instead chiefly through their palette of washed out clouds, lush fields, pale stones and cold seas. Pallant House, to 10 Jun SS Jeremiah Day, Sheffield Through a series of combinations of photographs, videos and audio recordings, Jeremiah Day builds up research into documentary subjects, the true significance of which remains elusive. His multiple perspectives focus in such peculiar disconnected detail on significant locations that the whole procedure takes on an air of cryptic allegory, as Day seeks out psychogeographic sites of political resistance. For him, buildings resound with historic stirrings and political hauntings. Of All Possible Things, his first UK solo exhibition, tackles the unresolved legacies of the cold war, focusing on a former Berlin Wall checkpoint that's now a Lidl supermarket.

      "bodyText": "Beyond The Clouds, London DJ Deep might not be the most inspiring musical moniker, but you can understand the desire of the man born Cyril Etienne des Rosaies to be known as something rather more inconspicuous, especially when his chosen mission for the last couple of decades has been to champion neglected cuts from the darkest recesses of the house and techno vaults.

Rising star Julian Deane has plenty at his disposal, part of a deliciously twisted set that never lets good taste get in the way of a big laugh. Deane's a bit older than the average up-and-coming comic, and this is reflected in his wearily cynical outlook on life. Hardly a fresh-faced, perky young performer, he's more like the sour heavy drinker in the corner of the bar, alternately leering at the girls and complaining about his mortgage. Despite this unpromising exterior, he's able to generate a stream of seriously good gags, the kind of quick, sharply written and endlessly repeatable lines that'll always keep a comic in work and an audience richly entertained. Churchill Theatre, Bromley, Sat Dan Evans, London Dan Evans is a properly silly stand-up. You won't find him throwing out well-crafted nuggets of observational comedy or telling a life-changing autobiographical story. Instead, he's more likely to fool around cracking bizarre gags about animals, throwing out endearingly awful puns or telling you how to perform wildly impractical practical jokes. He's very much the comedian as overgrown schoolboy: a lovable, balding imp determined to add a dash of the extraordinary to the everyday grind. And rather than overplaying the wackiness, he balances his surrealism with a down-to-earth delivery that makes the whole package all the more satisfying. While he's not yet had the mainstream TV recognition that his talents deserve, he's an entertaining stalwart of the live circuit, and a favourite with audiences as well with his notoriously hard-to-please comedic peers.

If you have kids you might pick him out as the star of CBBC's take on Monty Python, Sorry, I've Got No Head. Onstage Andrews is wildly experimental and inventive. Previous shows have seen him messing around with all sorts of unusual stage techniques including video and PowerPoint presentations. It's like being bombarded with ideas, most of them inspired, and many very funny. But Andrews is also great when he keeps it simple. Look out for his performances as a deliberately amateurish wannabe stand-up, murdering one-liners as he reads them off index cards; wonderfully imaginative, lightly subversive stuff. You'll find him this week at a one-off spectacular by the Alternative Comedy Memorial Society; other acts include Peep Show star Isy Suttie and Alexis Dubus as revolting French aesthete Marcel Lucont.

Sent to find help for the faltering defenders of humanity, Shepard's mission is one of shotgun diplomacy, luring, badgering and bribing other species into helping mankind before it's too late. You're offered the option to play as an action game, reducing conversations to non-interactive movies; a story, where conversations become the focus, or as a role-playing game, which is similar to past Mass Effect episodes. The plot is leaner and conversations less sprawling, giving an effective impression of being in your own extended space opera. Like Assassin's Creed: Revelations this outing is the apotheosis of the series' fighting, collecting and conversation mechanics even if its slightly peculiar looking characters and Kate Beckinsale-grade acting wring out much of its emotional impact. Electronic Arts, \u00a349.99 See last week's ME3 feature here Unit 13, PS Vita From Zipper Interactive, the folks behind the unloved and largely ropey SOCOM third person shooter franchise comes Unit 13, another game about military personnel shootin' for'ners. The difference here is that levels have been designed to provide tidy little bite-sized engagements which are ideal for small-screen use. Stealth sections aren't intrusive and even elite missions, where there are no checkpoints and typically only one or two places to recharge your health, initially feel like a pretty well-balanced challenge, testing your ability to exploit its cover-based return fire mechanics. Movement and aiming work well using the Vita's analogue joysticks and the level of aim assistance is better judged than the distinctly wobbly-feeling Uncharted: Golden Abyss. Eventually though, the fun starts to be sapped by brutally spaced checkpoints that regularly force you to repeat lengthy sections in order to progress, a process that after your 10th attempt starts to feel like a repetitious chore. It's a real shame because Unit 13's firefights are undoubtedly the finest currently available on a portable device. SCEE, \u00a334.99 Games news Also out this week are Street Fighter X Tekken (PS3, Xbox 360) as well as a Special Edition, which adds an arcade cabinet money box, comic book and gem power-ups to Capcom's crossover beat 'em-up \u2026 The Sims 3: Showtime (PC) lets your Sims take to the stage and tour friends' towns.

      "bodyText": "Liz Green Bad Medicine (Play It Again Sam) Liz stands out from the current crop of solo artists like turning the page of a book of moat-brown carpet swatches to find a pop-up of a giraffe, dressed as Evel Knievel riding a hovercraft over a canyon full of exploding dinosaurs. Unfortunately, that's only a slight exaggeration. With vocals like a phantom gramophone, almost ethereal brass sections and bleakly glorious lyrics, this eerily eccentric lump of assured blues chanteusery is definitely worth pointing your ears at. The Maccabees Feel To Follow (Fiction) Auto-Tune can be a fickle MihiihEEsteResseSSeSS at times. You've written a pretty good song, but not great, needs more ... something. What to do? Cowbell? Ill-advised rap verse? Drown it in dubstep? So many choices. Here, the Maccabees have attempted to rub Bon Iver all over themselves like a thick musky cologne, one that reeks of corduroy and beard detritus. Sadly, they just ended up making the opening vocals sound like Herbert the Pervert from Family Guy gargling a jar of pickled walnuts. Which is a shame, as it merely distracts from what turns out to be a rather nice and pleasantly swirly indie pop wobblealong. Katie Melua It's Better Than A Dream (Dramatico) Katie Melua's back after two unfathomably short years away. So, what treats does nobody's favourite mimsy-jazz squawker and haunted meringue have in store for us? It's standard Melua, a melody as banal as cardboard mist, chewy rhyming couplets, and endless fauxmantic wurbling about doors and illusions and Indian braves, and \u2026 lumme, turn it off! It's like someone opened a sodding Hotel Chocolat inside my mind. Paul Weller That Dangerous Age (Island) Paul recently described his new sound as \"groundbreaking, maybe, possibly\", the important words there being \"maybe, possibly\".

Unfortunately, that's only a slight exaggeration. With vocals like a phantom gramophone, almost ethereal brass sections and bleakly glorious lyrics, this eerily eccentric lump of assured blues chanteusery is definitely worth pointing your ears at.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HaW5alLnC0&amp;ob=av2e\" title=\"\"><strong>The Maccabees</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Feel To Follow (Fiction)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Auto-Tune can be a fickle MihiihEEsteResseSSeSS at times. You've written a pretty good song, but not great, needs more ... <em>something</em>. What to do? Cowbell? Ill-advised rap verse? Drown it in dubstep? So many choices. Here, the Maccabees have attempted to rub Bon Iver all over themselves like a thick musky cologne, one that reeks of corduroy and beard detritus. Sadly, they just ended up making the opening vocals sound like Herbert the Pervert from Family Guy gargling a jar of pickled walnuts. Which is a shame, as it merely distracts from what turns out to be a rather nice and pleasantly swirly indie pop wobblealong.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE3P7gtsMeQ\" title=\"\"><strong>Katie Melua</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>It's Better Than A Dream (Dramatico)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Katie Melua's back after two unfathomably short years away. So, what treats does nobody's favourite mimsy-jazz squawker and haunted meringue have in store for us? It's standard Melua, a melody as banal as cardboard mist, chewy rhyming couplets, and endless fauxmantic wurbling about doors and illusions and Indian braves, and \u2026 lumme, turn it off! It's like someone opened a sodding Hotel Chocolat inside my mind.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mGucuejMQE&amp;ob=av2e\" title=\"\"><strong>Paul Weller</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>That Dangerous Age (Island)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Paul recently described his new sound as \"groundbreaking, maybe, possibly\", the important words there being \"maybe, possibly\".

      "bodyText": "Willis Earl Beal, London The life of an \"outsider artist\" is genuinely lived on a knife edge. If things go well, you could find yourself like Willis Earl Beal, signed to a quality UK label such as XL. If they don't, you remain a homeless person, shouting. No one's saying Willis Earl Beal is crazy, but the Chicagoan has certainly conducted his young life so far in a fairly eccentric, even movie-worthy (Mos Def is said to be developing a film) kind of way. For Beal, his way to reach out to the world was by leaving flyers requesting friends wherever he went. After a spell spent homeless in New Mexico, he got a job as a hotel porter, in the downtime of which job he taught himself to play. His debut album Acousmatic Sorcery is a difficult listen, but one made easier by Beal's voice. Though untutored, he can \"do\" blues complaint, soul whisper and even a kind of quasi-hip-hop posturing, all of which he achieves with considerable aplomb. Sebright Arms, E2, Tue John Robinson Public Image Ltd, London However hard John Lydon tries to turn himself into a cartoon, PiL are there to redress the balance and remind the world that beyond the hilarity of his occasional public disgracefulness, he was part of a music that had a darker power. For this, he needed the unique talents of Jah Wobble's bass and the deceptively scratchy explorations of former Clash member Keith Levene, both of whom have lately been touring a \"dub\" version of Metal Box, the band's second album, without him. This is a development one imagines will further fuel Lydon's ire for his appearance in a reconfigured PiL as part of BBC 6 Music's 10th birthday celebrations. Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, Fri JR Diagrams, On tour Not on the surface an exciting group, British folkies Tunng have nevertheless incubated the talent of Sam Genders, who now has an electronic pop band, Diagrams, that recall the warmth of Metronomy. Live, the Diagrams show has become quite a production, swelling the original one-man recording set-up into a nine-piece band. The more the merrier, one imagines. Hoxton Square Bar &amp; Kitchen, N1, Tue; The Cooler, Bristol, Wed; Ruby Lounge, Manchester, Thu; Mojo Bar, Liverpool, Fri JR Tim Berne's Snakeoil, London If the American saxist-composer Tim Berne can be as uncompromising a performer as Ornette Coleman was in his early days, he remains (like Coleman) an improviser with deep jazz roots, driven by the complex polyphonic approach of the late World Saxophone Quartet guru Julius Hemphill. Berne favours stern, repeating melodies challenged by contrary lines of rhythm, dark loops disappearing into gathering storms of drums, quirky private dialogues, and unexpected passages of delicate lyricism. With his remarkable new Snakeoil ensemble, however, he downplays rawness in favour of a contemporary chamber ensemble sound, with the help of the eclectic Oscar Noriega on clarinets, Matt Mitchell on keyboards and Ches Smith on drums. It's a rare balance of composition, improvisation, and an acoustic ensemble's most subtle strengths. Vortex Jazz Club, N16, Wed &amp; Thu John Fordham Jazzwise To The Power Of 15, London It fits the bill that Chris Potter plays the finale of a glittering week of gigs celebrating the 15th anniversary of Jazzwise magazine. Potter's list of illustrious employers, from Charlie Parker trumpeter Red Rodney to bandleading legends Paul Motian and Dave Holland, is like a boiled-down jazz history in itself. Potter's unusual Underground fusion band has been one of his most telling innovations of recent times, but for these two forthcoming London gigs the saxophonist plays with a more orthodox acoustic lineup including the intriguing Steve Coleman, pianist David Virelles and drummer Gerald Cleaver. The week's Jazzwise festival shows also include London fusion trio Troyka with the Royal Academy of Music Big Band (Mon), UK postboppers Empirical and young German piano star Michael Wollny (Tue), and former Miles Davis bassist Ron Carter with pianist Renee Rosnes (Wed &amp; Thu). Ronnie Scott's, W1, Fri &amp; 17 Mar JF Miss Fortune, London It's 18 years since Judith Weir's last full-scale opera, Blond Eckbert, based upon a fairytale by Ludwig Tieck. Folk and fairy stories from a wide range of cultures have always figured prominently in Weir's musical lexicon, and it's no surprise to discover that this new stage work is also based upon a folk tale, this time from Sicily. Miss Fortune tells the story of Tina, a young woman from a wealthy family that suddenly loses all its money. Tina is forced to take on a succession of menial jobs until she encounters Fate and her fortunes begin to change. The production is by Chen Shi-Zheng and Paul Daniel conducts.

It's a cumbersome hero's journey fully of silly names, skimpy costumes and princesses in peril \u2013 stuff we've seen recycled so many times since Edgar Rice Burroughs first wrote this, it now feels laughably quaint. Still, it's always fun to see an expensively rendered alien world, even if cheesy myth-making comes with the territory. Trishna (15) (Michael Winterbottom, 2011, UK) Freida Pinto, Riz Ahmed, Roshan Seth. 113 mins Hardy's Tess looks a comfortable fit with modern-day India in this naturalistic drama, which takes liberties with the text but finds new resonances, as Pinto's subdued villager struggles to find happiness with a wealthy young British-Indian. The Raven (15) (James McTeigue, 2012, US) John Cusack, Alice Eve, Luke Evans. 111 mins Edgar Allan Poe must catch a murderer inspired by his stories in this surprisingly enjoyable 19th-century horror mystery. Is this what they mean by slash fiction? Bel Ami (15) (Declan Donnellan, Nick Ormerod, 2012, UK/Fra/Ita) Robert Pattinson, Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci. 103 mins Pattinson puts his ability to look really handsome to good use, as a chancer sleeping his way to the top ranks of 19th-century Paris.

This renamed festival shows some of the depth, with new films at Cin\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re, and older stuff at the Italian Cultural Institute. The new movies cover some familiar Italian preoccupations: organised crime (boxing thriller Tatanka, from a story by Roberto \"Gomorrah\" Saviano), family (Kryptonite) and coming of age (Summer Of Giacomo). But there are also new angles on Italian culture, such as Li And The Poet, dealing with a Chinese immigrant in Venice, and sci-fi The Last Man On Earth. Many of the films on show are UK premieres, including Scialla!, and there are films selected by the Corriere della Sera's top critic, TV sporting dramas and a tribute to the late Sicilian documentarian Vittorio De Seta. Cin\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re, SW7, Sat to Thu; Italian Cultural Institute, SW1, Thu to 30 Mar Flatpack Film Festival, Birmingham This joyously inventive event interprets the notion of a film festival loosely enough to incorporate an evening of psychedelic projections and live space rock, an audience-participation remake of Citizen Kane, a Birmingham Noir walking tour, and a \"gif shop\" where you can make your own animation and play it on a record deck. Elsewhere, there's puppet animation, cult 1970s cartoon movies with rock soundtracks, new films by Herzog and Kaurism\u00e4ki, satanist hippies, zombie bikers and even synthpop-producing Icelandic grannies (Grandma Lo-Fi). Various venues, Wed to 18 Mar Sh\u00fbji Terayama, London Terayama's activities in the postwar Japanese avant garde ranged from film-maker to playwright to poet to horse racing tipster, and subversion seems to have been the only constant. His highly experimental films often took aim at traditional society, and 1971's Emperor Tomato Ketchup details a child revolt against the adult world, with more sex and violence than any film-maker would dare today. The other films in this brief survey are equally confrontational, surprising and bizarre, but in myriad ways \u2013 from direct engagement with the audience to surreal imagery to satirising Japan's relationship with the west. Tate Modern, SE1, Fri to 25 Mar 14th London Asian Film Festival, London It's generally only one type of south Asian movie that gets released in the UK but this festival casts its net wider, without excluding Bollywood completely. The presence of Abhishek Bachchan doesn't immediately scream indie, nor does Guzaarish, starring Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai, but you'll be satisfied by the likes of Michael, a survey of Kolkata lives, or a documentary on Pakistan's persecuted transgender community. Of the safe bets there's the box office-busting Bol, but look out for a fair amount of culture crossing: Lucky, about a South African boy adopted by an Indian woman; and The Desire \u2013 A Journey Of A Woman, which details a love affair between a Chinese painter and an Indian Odissi dancer, played by Shilpa Shetty.

      "bodyText": "TV: El Wingador \"I was just a guy that liked eating chicken.\" So begins the story of champion competitive-eater Bill Simmons. Oscar-winning film-maker Errol Morris doesn't do anything fancy with this 10-minute short \u2013 it came off the back of shooting a KFC ad \u2013 but he really doesn't need to: Simmons carries the load, telling us about his \"training\" (15lbs of food and three gallons of water a day, apparently), and his inability to ever really be full. On winning the Philadelphia Wing Bowl five times: \"You've got to throw some reckless abandonment in and not worry about choking.\" Grotesque, but great. Online Theatre: Much Ado About Nothing If you weren't able to catch David Tennant and Catherine Tate in Much Ado About Nothing \u2013 one of last summer's hottest West End tickets \u2013 you can now do so at a fraction of the price and at your own convenience. Caught in high definition with impressive production values, the show can be downloaded or streamed straight to your desktop. There are plenty of other choice stage pickings on offer too, not least Kathryn Hunter's startling turn in Kafka's Monkey, and the underrated Parlour Song by Jez Butterworth, better known for the award-magnet Jerusalem. Online, \u00a36.99-\u00a310.99 Film: Ryan Trecartin online Born in Texas, raised in Ohio, Trecartin is often claimed as one of the most innovative artists working with video right now. His last exhibition \u2013 described by the New Yorker as \"an exhilarating onslaught\" from \"the magus of the Internet century\" \u2013 showed off some of his most hypnotic, bizarre and mind-bending films. You can watch plenty for free here. Online Music: Madonna Live Consider this a warm-up for the First Lady of Pop's upcoming world tour: a full-blown concert archive of all her finest stage moments. Heavy lace and lycra from the 1985 Virgin tour, conical bras and simulated sex from Blonde Ambition \u2013 there's little in Madge's live archive that's not here. In short, it's every kind of brilliant. YouTube Talks: TED talks The original TED conference \u2013 a bit like a geek Glastonbury of the mind \u2013 had its annual outing in Long Beach, California a fortnight ago. All the talks are online and well worth a browse. Try Susan Cain: The power of introverts, Vijay Kumar: Robots that fly \u2026 and cooperate, or Paul Gilding: The Earth is full. Online Music: TOTP2: Girl Groups From the Supremes to the Spice Girls, TOTP pays tribute to the glorious ladies (and ladettes) of pop. BBC iPlayer",

      "body": "<h2>TV: El Wingador</h2> <p>\"I was just a guy that liked eating chicken.\" So begins the story of champion competitive-eater Bill Simmons. Oscar-winning film-maker Errol Morris doesn't do anything fancy with this 10-minute short \u2013 it came off the back of shooting a KFC ad \u2013 but he really doesn't need to: Simmons carries the load, telling us about his \"training\" (15lbs of food and three gallons of water a day, apparently), and his inability to ever really be full. On winning the Philadelphia Wing Bowl five times: \"You've got to throw some reckless abandonment in and not worry about choking.\" Grotesque, but great.</p> <p><a href=\"http://video.nytimes.com/video/2012/02/03/opinion/100000001332130/el-wingador.html?scp=1&amp;sq=el%20wingador&amp;st=cse\" title=\"\"><em>Online</em></a></p> <h2>Theatre: Much Ado About Nothing</h2> <p>If you weren't able to catch David Tennant and Catherine Tate in Much Ado About Nothing \u2013 one of last summer's hottest West End tickets \u2013 you can now do so at a fraction of the price and at your own convenience. Caught in high definition with impressive production values, the show can be downloaded or streamed straight to your desktop. There are plenty of other choice stage pickings on offer too, not least Kathryn Hunter's startling turn in Kafka's Monkey, and the underrated Parlour Song by Jez Butterworth, better known for the award-magnet Jerusalem.</p> <p><a href=\"http://digitaltheatre.com\" title=\"\"><em>Online</em></a><em>, \u00a36.99-\u00a310.99</em></p> <h2>Film: Ryan Trecartin online</h2> <p>Born in Texas, raised in Ohio, Trecartin is often claimed as one of the most innovative artists working with video right now. His last exhibition \u2013 described by the New Yorker as \"an exhilarating onslaught\" from \"the magus of the Internet century\" \u2013 showed off some of his most hypnotic, bizarre and mind-bending films. You can watch plenty for free here.</p> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/trecartin/videos\" title=\"\"><em>Online</em></a></p> <h2>Music: Madonna Live</h2> <p>Consider this a warm-up for the First Lady of Pop's upcoming world tour: a full-blown concert archive of all her finest stage moments. Heavy lace and lycra from the 1985 Virgin tour, conical bras and simulated sex from Blonde Ambition \u2013 there's little in Madge's live archive that's not here. In short, it's every kind of brilliant.</p> <p><a href=\"http://youtube.com/themadonnatours\" title=\"\"><em>YouTube</em></a></p> <h2>Talks: TED talks</h2> <p>The original TED conference \u2013 a bit like a geek Glastonbury of the mind \u2013 had its annual outing in Long Beach, California a fortnight ago. All the talks are online and well worth a browse. Try Susan Cain: The power of introverts, Vijay Kumar: Robots that fly \u2026 and cooperate, or Paul Gilding: The Earth is full.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ted.com\" title=\"\"><em>Online</em></a></p> <h2>Music: TOTP2: Girl Groups</h2> <p>From the Supremes to the Spice Girls, TOTP pays tribute to the glorious ladies (and ladettes) of pop.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01d7k4q/TOTP2_Girl_Groups/\" title=\"\"><em>BBC iPlayer</em></a></p>",

But now perhaps we're all better placed to appreciate a good cameo, which is fortunate because we're about to be beaten around the chops with them all week. For example, Weeds (Mon, 10.20pm, Sky Atlantic) has just begun its gradual transformation into Will &amp; Grace, as it replaces everything that people loved about the show with an endless parade of desperate-eyed celebrity guest spots.

Elsewhere, Ken Jenkins makes another appearance on Cougar Town (Fri, 8.30pm, Sky Living) as Courteney Cox's dad, although that's not particularly surprising.

The Guest Appearance Of The Week award \u2013 and the Glee-est Thing That Glee Has Ever Gleed award \u2013 has to go to Glee (Thu, 9pm, Sky1), which, in a stroke of uncharacteristic genius, has cast Ricky Martin as McKinley High's new Spanish teacher.

(Sat, 9pm, BBC2), talking of his first Top Of The Pops. \"I thought someone might tell me what to wear.\" Popland in 1987 was a seemingly slapdash affair. One moment Astley is working in Stock Aitken &amp; Waterman's \"Hit Factory\" wrestling a Rank Xerox toner cartridge and bleaching Pete Waterman's favourite tea mug, the next he's a pop colossus with a No 1 hit. Rick appeared on TOTP in a self-bought, three-sizes-too-big blazer, criss-crossing his arms in a nod towards dancing, merely to fill up the stage. BBC2's Poplife series, covering boybands and girlbands, but now moving on to solo artists, has been warm, thoughtful and watchable. They're smart proof that with a strong narrative, good, funny and candid interviews as well as access to the BBC's vast pop culture archive, straw can be spun into gold. Astley is very funny on his lifespan in pop's rock pool from tadpole to frog-corpse; so too are Craig David, Gary Numan and Nik Kershaw. In fledgling days, snood-wearing 80s pop-minstrel Kershaw did enjoy the benefit of a \"styling meeting\" before TOTP. \"They were paying these stylists so much money I thought \u2026 well, I must look really good!\" A clip shows Nik on TOTP in a white denim box jacket, white cargo pants, a lemon snood, black wool fingerless gloves and boxer boots, with a Flock Of Seagulls bouffant. It seems that in their early days as wide-eyed ingenues, solo artists usually have a point to prove or an emotional hole to fill. Rick Astley talks of his parents' divorce which left him seeking the limelight; Paul Young had a childhood stutter which vanished whenever he sang; Peter Andre admits to a shrewd plan to become \"pop's Jean Claude Van Damme\". There's a lovely section on the reality of \"promo\" work: Gary Numan being marauded by Basil Brush, Sting in battle with Trevor &amp; Simon, Adam Ant flirting with Gordon The Gopher, a chance to win Jason Donovan's breath in a jam jar, and Ronan Keating's dismay at being told to put on a chicken costume at 5am and dance like he bloody well meant it. Of course, following them around are the fans: that legion of relentlessly squeaky, barely menstrual, mainly nonsensical worshippers, lurking in radio station foyers, breathless with inconsolable sobbing about how \"happy\" they are to have inhaled Shayne Ward's coffee-breath. As the fans lose their minds, so by turn, do their quarry, shifting from \"that affable kid who just wants to please\" to \"Mogwai from Gremlins, fed Krispy Kremes after midnight, then put under sprinklers\". The documentary shows that as a solo act it's virtually impossible to retain humility: when there's no one else to share praise with, it's all for lovely, lovely you. Nicole Scherzinger talks about \"feeling like she can shoot lightning bolts out of her fingers\". Rick Astley admits to kicking the crap out of his luggage in hotels; tired, petulant and furious, but just wise enough to avoid an invoice for standard rock star room-breakages. Then, just as experience makes pop life familiar and manageable, in a heartbeat, you're not on the guestlist; not even a standby for Hole In The Wall if Joe Swash can't make it. Gary Numan talks of actually missing the hatred in his bad reviews in the 90s: \"At least it was attention\". Modern-day faded pop stars must feel so grateful for the internet. The internet will always review your decline. It hits you (but it feels like a kiss).",

      "bodyText": "It's Sunday morning, and I'm in a draughty soft-play centre with punitive acoustics, balancing a foil-wrapped cake in one hand and four pairs of children's shoes in the other: yes, it's birthday time again, our third post-separation, and I think we're getting the hang of it. It's still strange, though, negotiating the cycle of presents, cake and party between two of us. I found myself making birthday cake in a deserted house, following my younger son's terse, bewildering instructions (\"monster, green, one eye, red claws, tail with fire\") as best I could. In the evening, I took it, and some presents, round to X's house and we all had dinner: me, him, both boys and Anna, the German au pair. All very modern. I hadn't been to the old house for a while and it looks, or feels, different in some indefinable way: the primitive heart of me registers that it smells different; it's not my territory any more. There's a neat bag of matching slippers in the hall and the kitchen is full of Anna's vegetarian stuff \u2013 tofu, tahini, aubergines \u2013 items never previously glimpsed within these walls. After dinner (aubergine-free), and once the fiery-tailed cyclops cake had been approved by its designer, I read both boys a bedtime story, covertly checking out what was new, altered, shifted: a proper desk for the eldest, bedside lamps I didn't recognise, and our ancient glitter ball finally affixed to the ceiling. As I walked home alone later, I felt bereft beyond my normal sadness at leaving the children. I don't often miss the house but I do miss the certainty, the solidity of it. It feels more like a home now that I don't live there, now I can see it from the outside. Today, a few days later, we're reconvening for the dreaded party, which we've agreed is best got over with in the morning. Consensus on things like that seems easier now. When we were together, birthdays were a battleground, with me pushing for oligarch-style extravagance, and X maintaining that modern children need to learn how to have fun with a twig and a single deflated balloon. Now that there's no financial disapproval to react against (and, importantly, no money), I have scaled down my party ambitions. X picked me up from home and we've driven to the soft-play centre to face the full-frontal assault of 20 seven year olds. \"Are you OK?\" he says as we're queueing. I have allowed my heavy head to rest against the cool glass of the fire door momentarily. I am terribly hung-over: I went out with my friend Jamie who brooks no dissent in the matter of drinking, and we ended up in a transvestite cabaret in the early hours. I woke up this morning face down in my bed fully clothed (thankfully), with my glasses still on, and things haven't improved greatly since. \"I'll be fine.\" I don't tell him I'm hung-over: we don't talk about what we do outside of looking after the children much. We've developed an odd taboo around the social lives we've developed separately, the people we see and the places we go. Sometimes X shows up to drop the boys off or collect them looking as rough as I feel right now, perhaps mentioning he's hardly slept, but he doesn't give details and I don't ask. On the odd occasions he does mention a bar or a club, I try to picture him there and fail. When we lived together, we didn't really go out: mainly we watched too much TV and ate too many meals on trays. It's harder to do that on your own without the validation that another body on the sofa brings: for me, it doesn't feel like cosy domesticity so much as failure. So we both relentlessly socialise, far, I think, beyond our natural inclinations. After a restorative packet of crisps and can of Coke, the party is fine. It's shambolic, loud and sweaty, but they have fun and we don't lose or injure anyone. X does all the loud, entertaining, nonsensical bits and I do the organising, finding coats and shoes, distributing cake and presents. We make a good team, as always. Afterwards, he drops me and the flushed, over-excited children back at home, kisses them quickly and rushes off. He has somewhere to be, apparently.",

Now that there's no financial disapproval to react against (and, importantly, no money), I have scaled down my party ambitions.</p> <p>X picked me up from home and we've driven to the soft-play centre to face the full-frontal assault of 20 seven year olds. \"Are you OK?\" he says as we're queueing. I have allowed my heavy head to rest against the cool glass of the fire door momentarily. I am terribly hung-over: I went out with my friend Jamie who brooks no dissent in the matter of drinking, and we ended up in a transvestite cabaret in the early hours. I woke up this morning face down in my bed fully clothed (thankfully), with my glasses still on, and things haven't improved greatly since.</p> <p>\"I'll be fine.\"</p> <p>I don't tell him I'm hung-over: we don't talk about what we do outside of looking after the children much. We've developed an odd taboo around the social lives we've developed separately, the people we see and the places we go. Sometimes X shows up to drop the boys off or collect them looking as rough as I feel right now, perhaps mentioning he's hardly slept, but he doesn't give details and I don't ask. On the odd occasions he does mention a bar or a club, I try to picture him there and fail. When we lived together, we didn't really go out: mainly we watched too much TV and ate too many meals on trays. It's harder to do that on your own without the validation that another body on the sofa brings: for me, it doesn't feel like cosy domesticity so much as failure. So we both relentlessly socialise, far, I think, beyond our natural inclinations.</p> <p>After a restorative packet of crisps and can of Coke, the party is fine. It's shambolic, loud and sweaty, but they have fun and we don't lose or injure anyone. X does all the loud, entertaining, nonsensical bits and I do the organising, finding coats and shoes, distributing cake and presents. We make a good team, as always. Afterwards, he drops me and the flushed, over-excited children back at home, kisses them quickly and rushes off. He has somewhere to be, apparently.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Snapshot: My dad, the bicycle pioneer This photograph from the Irish Press shows my father, GF Harding, sitting on a bicycle underneath a Constellation aeroplane flanked by the TWA pilot and an airline official. It is dated 1948 and the following report from the press cutting outlines the story: The first stage in an unusual link between Cork City and Peiping, the ancient capital of China, was made on Thursday evening when a young Corkman completed the 80-mile journey to Shannon on a bicycle. He was Mr George F Harding of South Terrace, Cork, and the bicycle was a special one, which he built himself, and put on board a TWA cargo plane for New York. From there it will be shipped to Peiping. The story began last summer, when a young native of Boston, Mass, Mr Joe Nerbonne, visited Schull in County Cork, the home of his mother's people. He was on his way back to the US from Europe with an urgent personal requirement, unsatisfied. An employee of the US Consulate in Peiping, he urgently required a bicycle that was not too heavy, not too light, yet able to stand up to Chinese wartime roads. He could not buy one in the US and when he visited the recent cycle show in London, of the many thousands of machines exhibited, there was not one suitable and no British firm could manufacture and deliver him a special model sooner than four months. But at Schull, his wants were unexpectedly satisfied. He met an enterprising young Corkman who agreed to make a bicycle exactly according to Mr Nerbonne's specifications. \"Previous to this,\" said Mr Harding, I supplied eight machines to special orders to American youth hostellers as I am interested in this movement.\" Mr Harding added, \"I am just hoping myself some day, to make enough money to do a cycle tour of the US and that is going to be a lot of cycling.\" My father's cycle tour was not to be, because he always appeared to be too busy, and he died in 1988 without fulfilling his ambition. Cycling and the cycle business was his life, and he was a founding member of An \u00d3ige the Irish Youth Hostelling Association in 1939. He had been working in the Norman Cycles factory, in Kent, during the second world war, when he lived in Ashford. He returned to Cork and opened his shop there 16 July 1945. He was assistant manager in the first Tour of Britain cycle race in 1951 won by Ian Steel. One of the Irish team, Karl McCarthy, finished ninth. My father eventually retired from the business in the early 1980s and I took it over. One day, in 1998, I overheard a man with an American accent talking to one of my employees. He said: \"I bought a bicycle from George Harding here in 1948.\" I interrupted the conversation, and on a wild hunch, said: \"Would you ever be Joe Nerbonne?\" And he was. So I took him upstairs to the office to show him the photograph, and the letters he had written in the late 1940s and early 50s to my father, including one on Associated Press-headed paper from Saigon, in 1956. Joe told me he was in Cork with his son, to do the same thing that brought him to Cork in 1948 \u2013 cycle to Schull and check up on his ancestral family. On a different bicycle, of course. The bike in the photo was built with 26x1\u00be wheels complete with cantilever brakes, which made it a forerunner of the modern mountain bike. George Harding Playlist: Music, love and promises in the attic Songbird by Fleetwood Mac \"And the songbirds are singing like they know the score / And I love you ...\" When I was 17, a friend and his sister had three rooms that constituted the top of their parents' large Victorian house \u2013 and where their parents never ventured. A group of us, girls and boys, spent a lot of time hanging out there that summer, untroubled by adult intervention or advice. Between the smoking, chatting and listening to records, love was avowed and promises made, trust given and betrayals perpetrated, tears shed and doors slammed. Looking back, it seems like a role-play activity in preparation for our impending adulthood. Prominent in the soundtrack to our summer was Fleetwood Mac's album Rumours. It's hard to imagine the designers of today's relationships education syllabus recommending shutting a bunch of adolescents in an attic with a copy of Rumours and telling them to work it out, but that's how we did it, and we had fun along the way. When I listen to the album today, more than 30 years on, I remember those raw, youthful passions. My favourite track is Songbird, an oasis of calm among the other songs that throb with bitter energy. When it came on, we'd go quiet and listen. Bickering is an exhausting business, and Songbird gave us a rest and time to ponder that none of it really mattered that much, before turning the record over and getting back into the fray. Morgan King We love to eat: Wainy Wonders Ingredients 2 slices of bread Anything you fancy that's ready to eat, such as butter, crisps, peanut butter, Marmite, jam, ham, gherkin, cheese, tomato, apple, pickled onion, pineapple ring, mashed banana, pickle, lettuce, cucumber, mustard, chocolate spread One teenage summer, my sister Ruth and I were staying with our cousins, the Wains. At our first lunchtime, Carl told us to pile everything we could find in the fridge and pantry on the table. \"I'm going to have cheese and ham and ketchup,\" I said. \"I had it once in a Little Chef and it's ace.\" \"Well, you can have a sandwich if you want,\" he said, \"but I'm having a Wainy Wonder.\" He grabbed a piece of bread and the butter. Then cut a slice of cheese. A lettuce leaf went on. So far, so sandwich. Then some mustard. A slice of tinned corned beef. He looked round the table and spotted pickled gherkins. A cucumber. On a second piece of bread, he spread peanut butter, then turned it over and plonked it on top of the teetering tower. Ruth and I looked at each other and grinned. Then we grabbed the bread and began rootling through the packets, jars and tins on the table to begin our own constructions. If you've done it right, a Wainy Wonder will be difficult to eat: either because it is too thick, or because the filling is spilling. There are only two rules: it must have at least four ingredients (not counting butter) and, since you've made it yourself, you have to eat it all. Ruth and I were astonished to learn recently that both Carl and Richard had forgotten all about their legendary creation. She and I \u2013 and now my own kids \u2013 still gorge ourselves on Wainy Wonders, while my cousins' offspring are stuck in the Late Sandwich Age. So, what's my favourite Wainy Wonder? If you're asking, you're missing the point: the aficionado approaches the construction of the next Wainy Wonder with no preconceived ideas. If you're thinking \"Marmite, ham, cheese, pineapple ring and some crisps on top\" then you're not inventing a glorious Wainy Wonder, you're just making a sandwich \u2013 and where's the fun in that?

      "bodyText": "I have a very small family. Perhaps that's part of why I am a writer. From when I was very young, I made up my own big families and wrote endless stories about them. I was an only child, and I particularly longed for jolly older brothers and special, understanding sisters. I adored my mother and did my best to please her when I was growing up. She loved me very much but she's always been a very determined, forceful lady. She had a very clear idea of what sort of child she wanted and it wasn't me. She'd have liked a Shirley Temple child, all bounce and sparkle. I was shy and mousey and didn't live up to her expectations. My dad was a rather scary father. He had big temper tantrums and sometimes wouldn't talk for days, which was unnerving to say the least. But he was also an imaginative father. He used to go to Westminster library near where he worked (he was a civil servant) and come back with quite surprising choices of books for me \u2013 such as Rumer Godden's The Greengage Summer, which became one of my favourites. He had an unerring knack of knowing what sort of books I'd like. My parents didn't really get on. Like so many other people, they married quickly during the second world war. They discovered that they had nothing in common. In those days you didn't divorce and, anyway, my mother would never have earned enough to keep both of us, so they soldiered on for many years. They eventually broke up when I was grown up and married with a daughter. I used to get frightened by their rows and arguments, so I generally made myself scarce. I escaped into my own internal imaginary world. I loved reading and playing pretend games and writing stories. I knew from very early on that I wanted to be a writer.Perhaps if I'd been part of a large jolly family with lots of brothers and sisters, I would not be the writer I am now. My daughter Emma is the love of my life. I adore her. I've been so lucky. We've always been close and now she's grown up we're still great friends. I had Emma when I was very young. We played together and I read to her, and we sort of discovered culture together. I had not really been to art galleries or museums as a child so I discovered them through her childhood. We chat on the phone every day now and recommend books to each other and meet whenever we can go shopping and see an exhibition. Emma showed great flair for writing but she was always certain that she didn't want to be a fiction writer like her mum. She wanted to follow her own course. This is my chance to be an irritatingly proud parent. Emma is now in her 40s and she is a professor of French literature and film at Cambridge University. I left school at 16 and her father at 15, so you can see why we're so proud of her. She's a very loyal girl. I try not to foist my books on her, but even now she always remembers when there is a new book coming out and always asks for a copy, and says something positive and pertinent.

      "bodyText": "Mark Wahlberg has just got off a plane from Australia \u2013 and he does not want to do this interview. It shows in his limp handshake, his lack of eye contact, and in the way he punctuates our time with either a monosyllabic answer, or a comically protracted yawn. All of which is fine \u2013 he's a jetlagged father of four, after all \u2013 if a little tedious. But then, Wahlberg must be used to tedious. Nearly every interview he's done since his remarkably sensitive breakout role in 1997's Boogie Nights has started with his shady past, and ended with a touching portrait of the young man as father. So the Guardian asks him straight: is there anything he's sick of speaking about? \"I'll let my interpreter answer that,\" he says dismissively, sinking into an armchair, leaning back and closing his eyes. His \"interpreter\" is Howard, an affable long-time friend with a severe speech impediment whom he's known since the early 90s. He's an odd choice of entourage; a cynic might suggest he's there for Wahlberg to genially employ as an occasional human shield against conversational topics he'd rather not delve into. But quite why Wahlberg \u2013 named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2011 \u2013 should need any such protection is confusing. He's made it clear since his cocky, Entourage-style days as rapper Marky \"brother of New Kid Donnie\" Mark, that he doesn't much care what anyone thinks. And to be fair, why would he? Here's a man who beat the odds on a past filled with violent crime, jail time, drug-dealing and street hustling followed by redemption to become an A-list actor and heavyweight Hollywood TV producer. Frankly, I'd be taking a nap too. Over the next 45 minutes, Wahlberg snaps out of his torpor only when the subject matter piques his interest. I ask about his children, and instantly, he's a different man; animated, alert and brimming with adoration. \"Look at this guy,\" he says, showing me his son Brendan. \"He wants me to sleep in his little race-car bed, and he keeps watching to make sure I don't leave till he falls asleep.\" Mark Wahlberg, family man \u2013 it's clear this is the role that comes easiest to him, and that the press obligations surrounding his work are nothing but distractions. A few weeks ago, a comment he made about 9/11 in a interview with Men's Journal (\"If I was on that plane with my kids, it wouldn't have went down like it did\") placed him in the line of media fire from hair-trigger patriots and the general outraged masses. \"I just don't understand that reaction,\" he says wearily. \"Do I regret it? Yes. But it was clearly taken out of context. The journalist was asking a bunch of inappropriate questions about sex interspersed with more serious questions, and I was trying to articulate how far I would go to protect my family. It was just \u2026 nonsense.\" Does he care what people think? \"Not much at all. After the age of 40, who gives a shit? I want people to come see my films and enjoy them but at the end of the day you can't control what people think. You can only apologise, which I did. Listen \u2013 there's a lot of things I wish I hadn't said. This is not my favourite part of the job, as I think you probably can tell,\" he adds, with the wryest of smiles. Playing it safe doesn't appear to be on his list when it comes to opening his mouth \u2013 he later makes a joke about being on cocaine, then tells me rather seriously, \"You know I was kidding, right?\" \u2013 but it's something of a disappointment that since his multi-layered, hugely charismatic portrayal of genitally blessed porn star Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights, he's been widely more cautious with his roles \u2013 a big bag of heavily muscled cops, reformed bad boys, security guards and boxers. Which is not to say that some of them don't run a little deeper, like his deservedly Oscar-nominated turn as a foul-mouthed cop in The Departed or his extraordinary Micky Ward in The Fighter. But by and large, does he play it safe? 'I was a street hustler. I did whatever it took. I sold whatever I could sell. I'm a good organiser' \"I can always see something of myself in the characters I play. Sure, I enjoy playing just a straightforward guys' guy. I think that's what people expect and that's what people enjoy seeing me do,\" he says, neither irritated nor particularly interested in the comparison. \"Why not? I have a lot of real-life experience with both cops and villains, so I channel that. I did The Departed, all the other guys were like, 'Let's go do some research', and I was like, 'For what?' Eighteen years of dealing with cops. I know how to act like one.\" What film stars did he idolise when he was growing up? Here, Wahlberg doesn't hesitate. \"James Cagney, Steve McQueen, I loved all those guys. I grew up loving the movies but had no desire to be in them. I didn't think it was possible considering where I came from. I used to go to the movies with my dad. We saw Hard Times with Charles Bronson when I was seven and I remember thinking, 'Cool.' But I wasn't thinking, 'I wanna be a movie star'; I was thinking, 'I wanna be a bare-knuckle fighter like the guys in the movies.'\" The alpha-male fetish resolved, it's his emerging role as a credible producer of such hugely successful shows as Boardwalk Empire, In Treatment and latest movie Contraband that's genuinely intriguing. His first venture was 2004's Entourage, an enjoyably shallow comedy-drama about life in the fast lane for a young Hollywood actor and his friends. It was based loosely around Wahlberg's early days in Hollywood. \"I don't want to give any details of my experiences. Take creative liberties, make something up,\" he says; he's far more interested in what the show has achieved for its stars than its over-analysed genesis. \"What I love about Entourage though, and what I love about producing in general is how it gives me the ability to put others in a position to do great work. Look at Jeremy Piven: he never had a place to showcase his abilities, till Entourage came along. He always had it in him, but he just needed that vehicle and I was able to provide it. It's a great thing to do.\" His latest film, Contraband, is a perfectly enjoyable, if predictable, action thriller, adapted from the 2008 Icelandic film Reykjav\u00edk-Rotterdam. Wahlberg flexes familiarly as Chris, a reformed smuggler on one last job to protect his family; once again, hardly a stretch. What's striking about the film are its high-calibre stunts and effects, achieved on an impressively tight budget. \"A film like this would usually cost about $60m,\" Wahlberg says, with a notable glimmer of pride \"But we had a great cast and crew, and we filmed it very much like an independent film, shot the whole thing in 40 days, for $25m. We did a lot of the stunt stuff ourselves. I don't mention that in an 'aren't we cool' way, I just liked that we did it because it saved money.\" I'm beginning see what it is about film that Wahlberg's truly passionate about. He's a good actor but he's a great businessman. \"I have a lot of other businesses outside film: property, wellbeing, and construction,\" he agrees. \"Producing suits me because I have a business mind and a business sensibility. I was a street hustler. I did whatever it took. I sold whatever I could sell. I'm a good organiser.\" 'I said I can always see something of myself in the characters I play, and you assume that means I can only play big tough guys' As a man who revels in creative control, and has worked with everyone from Martin Scorsese to Tim Burton to Peter Jackson, he wants to direct, of course. \"What would you like to direct?\" I ask, and suddenly, he clams up. \"Films,\" he says moodily, as though I'm asking if he's tidied his room; I'm half expecting him to add \"Duh!\" I roll my eyes, and he concedes this round of the game with a smile: \"I enjoy all kinds of films, except musicals. When I find that particular story that I want to tell, I'll let everyone know.\" Perhaps a move into comedy is next? For the first time, he's less surefooted in his approach. \"I wasn't exactly uncomfortable when I did my first comedy,\" he says thoughtfully. \"I was just very aware of the risks; if you do a comedy that sucks and you suck in it then you won't get a chance to do it again.\" With typical savvy, he placed himself in the safe hands of Will Ferrell in The Other Guys, and Steve Carrell in Date Night, a film in which he maintained a state of shirtlessness at all times. A self-deprecating pastiche of his modelling days, I ask? And fair's fair: now it's his turn to roll his eyes. \"What do you think?\" He's palpably excited about his upcoming film, Ted, directed by Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane, a project which sees him move beautifully from alpha to beta male, playing a grown man whose best friend is a malevolent talking teddy. I love the image but it's a struggle to see how it's something he's able to relate to from personal experience. \"I said I can always see something of myself in the characters I play, and you assume that means I can only play big tough guys,\" he says. \"But look, here's this bullied little kid, a guy who has no friends and gets beat up a lot, and he makes his bear his best friend. It's a buddy movie. It's a childhood friendship that changes, and the character is this guy who grows into the man he needs to be for the people in his life. I was the youngest of nine kids. There's always something I can relate to. I don't always need to be beating someone up!\" \"So you're definitely not a method actor?\" I ask teasingly. At this, Wahlberg hoots with laughter. \"Let me tell you something,\" he says. \"I was in a rehearsal for a movie that never got made with a very famous actor and director. And they decided to do this acting exercise. 'Think of water. Think of the colour blue. Think of a place that you used to go hide when you were a kid when you wanted to be alone.' I thought, 'This is a practical joke!' So I opened my eyes, and they were all just sobbing their hearts out! I was kind of in shock. And that's when I thought, 'OK, I guess I'm pretty lucky I have a lot of real-life experiences to draw my sad emotions from so I didn't have to think about where I wanted to 'be alone as a boy'. Give me a break.\" He uses his best \"insufferable ac-tor\" voice for emphasis. And I realise that Ted is probably going to be very, very good; perhaps the dark and meaty role Dirk Diggler fans have been waiting for. Because even when he's jetlagged, spouting ill-advised platitudes, or being just plain stubborn, Mark Wahlberg's actually kind of funny.",

Here, Wahlberg doesn't hesitate.</p> <p>\"James Cagney, Steve McQueen, I loved all those guys. I grew up loving the movies but had no desire to be in them. I didn't think it was possible considering where I came from. I used to go to the movies with my dad. We saw Hard Times with Charles Bronson when I was seven and I remember thinking, 'Cool.' But I wasn't thinking, 'I wanna be a movie star'; I was thinking, 'I wanna be a bare-knuckle fighter like the guys in the movies.'\"</p> <p>The alpha-male fetish resolved, it's his emerging role as a credible producer of such hugely successful shows as Boardwalk Empire, In Treatment and latest movie Contraband that's genuinely intriguing. His first venture was 2004's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/sep/10/entourage-jonathan-bernstein-wahlberg\" title=\"\">Entourage</a>, an enjoyably shallow comedy-drama about life in the fast lane for a young Hollywood actor and his friends. It was based loosely around Wahlberg's early days in Hollywood. \"I don't want to give any details of my experiences. Take creative liberties, make something up,\" he says; he's far more interested in what the show has achieved for its stars than its over-analysed genesis.</p> <p>\"What I love about Entourage though, and what I love about producing in general is how it gives me the ability to put others in a position to do great work. Look at Jeremy Piven: he never had a place to showcase his abilities, till Entourage came along. He always had it in him, but he just needed that vehicle and I was able to provide it. It's a great thing to do.\"</p> <p>His latest film, Contraband, is a perfectly enjoyable, if predictable, action thriller, adapted from the 2008 Icelandic film Reykjav\u00edk-Rotterdam. Wahlberg flexes familiarly as Chris, a reformed smuggler on one last job to protect his family; once again, hardly a stretch. What's striking about the film are its high-calibre stunts and effects, achieved on an impressively tight budget.</p> <p>\"A film like this would usually cost about $60m,\" Wahlberg says, with a notable glimmer of pride \"But we had a great cast and crew, and we filmed it very much like an independent film, shot the whole thing in 40 days, for $25m. We did a lot of the stunt stuff ourselves. I don't mention that in an 'aren't we cool' way, I just liked that we did it because it saved money.\" I'm beginning see what it is about film that Wahlberg's truly passionate about. He's a good actor but he's a great businessman.</p> <p>\"I have a lot of other businesses outside film: property, wellbeing, and construction,\" he agrees. \"Producing suits me because I have a business mind and a business sensibility. I was a street hustler. I did whatever it took. I sold whatever I could sell. I'm a good organiser.\"</p> <h2>'I said I can always see something of myself in the characters I play, and you assume that means I can only play big tough guys'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-387256633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/9/1331291500996/THE-DEPARTED-004.jpg\" alt=\"THE DEPARTED\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Alec Baldwin in The Departed. Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a man who revels in creative control, and has worked with everyone from Martin Scorsese to Tim Burton to Peter Jackson, he wants to direct, of course. \"What would you like to direct?\" I ask, and suddenly, he clams up. \"Films,\" he says moodily, as though I'm asking if he's tidied his room; I'm half expecting him to add \"Duh!\" I roll my eyes, and he concedes this round of the game with a smile: \"I enjoy all kinds of films, except musicals. When I find that particular story that I want to tell, I'll let everyone know.\"</p> <p>Perhaps a move into comedy is next? For the first time, he's less surefooted in his approach.</p> <p>\"I wasn't exactly uncomfortable when I did my first comedy,\" he says thoughtfully. \"I was just very aware of the risks; if you do a comedy that sucks and you suck in it then you won't get a chance to do it again.\" With typical savvy, he placed himself in the safe hands of Will Ferrell in The Other Guys, and Steve Carrell in Date Night, a film in which he maintained a state of shirtlessness at all times. A self-deprecating pastiche of his modelling days, I ask? And fair's fair: now it's his turn to roll his eyes. \"What do you think?\"</p> <p>He's palpably excited about his upcoming film, Ted, directed by Family Guy's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jul/31/seth-macfarlane-family-guy-singing-bbc-proms\" title=\"\">Seth MacFarlane</a>, a project which sees him move beautifully from alpha to beta male, playing a grown man whose best friend is a malevolent talking teddy. I love the image but it's a struggle to see how it's something he's able to relate to from personal experience.</p> <p>\"I said I can always see something of myself in the characters I play, and you assume that means I can only play big tough guys,\" he says. \"But look, here's this bullied little kid, a guy who has no friends and gets beat up a lot, and he makes his bear his best friend. It's a buddy movie. It's a childhood friendship that changes, and the character is this guy who grows into the man he needs to be for the people in his life. I was the youngest of nine kids. There's always something I can relate to. I don't always need to be beating someone up!\"</p> <p>\"So you're definitely not a method actor?\" I ask teasingly. At this, Wahlberg hoots with laughter.</p> <p>\"Let me tell you something,\" he says. \"I was in a rehearsal for a movie that never got made with a very famous actor and director. And they decided to do this acting exercise. 'Think of water. Think of the colour blue. Think of a place that you used to go hide when you were a kid when you wanted to be alone.' I thought, 'This is a practical joke!' So I opened my eyes, and they were all just sobbing their hearts out! I was kind of in shock. And that's when I thought, 'OK, I guess I'm pretty lucky I have a lot of real-life experiences to draw my sad emotions from so I didn't have to think about where I wanted to 'be alone as a boy'. Give me a break.\"</p> <p>He uses his best \"insufferable ac-tor\" voice for emphasis. And I realise that Ted is probably going to be very, very good; perhaps the dark and meaty role Dirk Diggler fans have been waiting for. Because even when he's jetlagged, spouting ill-advised platitudes, or being just plain stubborn, Mark Wahlberg's actually kind of funny.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What to make of Lynne Featherstone? This Liberal Democrat MP is one of a tiny handful of women in government; she is dedicated to tackling violence against women internationally, and is a feminist who has spoken up for equality and women's rights. What's not to like? Yet few ministers suffer such a bad rep, not just from Conservatives, but the very women's groups who fought so hard for her role to be created. Her tendency to go off on a tangent during debates, or say the wrong thing (\"there's nothing wrong with sex\" when asked to comment on a pornographer-turned-candidate to a crowd of young feminists) has led to much name-calling. Some of the disappointment is political, of course. The fact she was elected on a liberal agenda, to work in a coalition that can seem anything but, makes her position more invidious than most. One rights campaigner compared her to Neville Chamberlain, \"waving around papers and policies while services [for women] are dying on their knees, as are women's wages and the value of women's economic contribution generally\". Still, I wonder how much of the criticism is fair. Is this just an example of women in power being held to a higher standard? Boris Johnson makes faux pas all the time and his popularity as an amiable buffoon just seems to increase. When Featherstone forgets what she wanted to ask after spending ages attracting the speakers' attention, the laughter is a little meaner. As the Guardian's women's editor, I want to support her, and will face charges of hypocrisy if I don't. But our previous meetings have not been encouraging. The last time I saw her at a public event, Featherstone was asked what powers the government had to encourage boards to appoint women. \"I have the power of all middle-aged women,\" she said without missing a beat, \"the power to nag.\" My heart sank. Am I just failing to see the joke? Am I becoming the po-faced feminazi the women's editor is expected to be? Surely the focus should be on her performance as equalities minister, a post that is an achievement in itself given that it took the government six months to decide to appoint someone to a job created by the last administration. An interview during International Women's week seemed the perfect opportunity to find out. Featherstone, 60, has had a busy week following a UN summit on the status of women in New York, in which she hosted an event on women's representation in the media and its impact on body confidence. She argues that body image is a kind of violence against women, as they contort and twist themselves into unrealistic shapes. \"People can be a bit sniffy and say, what's that got to do with anything,\" she says. \"It's massively important. It affects everybody, especially young people. Women are made to feel bad about themselves by multimillion [pound] industries. And it's a truly international issue.\" In the stream of consciousness that follows, she says this: \"There's obviously sometimes a good rationale for plastic surgery. When you've had five children and your breasts are hanging around your waist, and it's affecting your life, then I wouldn't really have a problem with that woman getting that sorted \u2026 \" Before I can draw breath, she adds that such a decision is a \"judgment for a doctor to make\", before going on to talk about the iniquities of young girls having breast implants at 16. I feel a bit floored. Feminism is a broad church \u2013 big enough for those who believe the right to choose covers women who choose surgery \u2013 but here is an equalities minister, outraged by women being forced to look a certain way, who thinks droopy boobs are cause for surgery. More frustrating than this is the nagging sense that she is not entirely on top of her admittedly wide-ranging brief \u2013 or that she is playing politics. I'm left with this impression after the conversation turns to legal aid and domestic violence. The government's controversial plan to cut \u00a3350m from the legal aid bill, which this week suffered a defeat in the Lords, has been attacked by women's groups such as Rights of Women, who believe that as many as half of victims will no longer be eligible for aid. This is partly because of a changed definition, which prompted the defeat, but also new evidence rules that place the onus on victims reporting to the police. Yet Featherstone says: \"There's a lot of misconception over this, and my understanding is that legal aid for domestic violence will be as it has always been, and if you need an injunction you can go to any solicitor and it will be paid for.\" Really? That will cheer campaigners. \"That's what drives me mad,\" she says. \"You work to preserve legal aid for victims of domestic violence and then \u2026There are issues around definition that weren't warranted. It was legalese.\" After phone calls to the Home Office it becomes clear the definition she is talking about has to do with what constitutes domestic violence, rather than the evidence issue. There are no plans to change the so-called \"gateway plans\", and none set to be announced by the Home Office. So to say that legal aid for domestic violence will be \"as it has always been\" isn't entirely right. To be fair, the most controversial government policies on women were not her fault. She is one woman from the weaker partner in a coalition that set off on the wrong foot with its very first budget and earliest plans to end rape anonymity (which she condemned). As Heather Harvey, research and development manager at Eaves, a London-based domestic violence charity, says: \"It's a fundamental problem in this government that they don't understand feminism and women's rights.\" But even well-received news doesn't seem to be driven by her. Astonishingly, just a day before David Cameron and Nick Clegg announce the government does in fact support the Council of Europe convention on violence against women, Featherstone defends the UK's previous footdragging. It's all about inquiries into \"forced marriages\" and the difficulty of \"jurisdiction\", apparently. She may not have wanted to spoil the boss's thunder, but why defend the failure to sign? She is not helped by the fact that her role as \"international champion\" was meant to be a ministerial one when it was first given to Glenys Kinnock, but now merely provides a small budget to book flights while the men in the three big foreign departments get to announce the policies. So when she says, as she does again in this interview, \"I have the powers of high-level nagging which are extremely good\", it may actually be a fair assessment. Isn't she disappointed by her lack of ministerial office? \"I am disappointed with everything that doesn't put women on every line, but in terms of negotiating and achieving, the end may be achieved by a more subtle approach.\" On the plus side, there are no \"silos\", and everyone is now working on fighting for women's rights. \"It really doesn't matter if it's me or our male ministers, everyone gets it now.\" Yet evidence on the government's position on Afghanistan, an acute issue given the emphasis on women's rights as a reason for military intervention in the first place, and the fact that details of the withdrawal are being negotiated, suggests \"getting it\" only goes so far. So although she won plaudits for attending the Bonn summit that agreed the safety of Afghan women must be a priority, the government's own strategic pact, signed just a few months later by Cameron and Hamid Karzi, made only fleeting mention of women in a sub-clause on human rights. Cameron failed to mention the issue at all in his speech. Featherstone says there is still much to play for with future conventions and denies the statement was a disappointment. There have, of course, been successes since her appointment in November 2010. Her advocacy for lesbians, gays and bisexuals \u2013 in marriage and overseas \u2013 is making waves in a government where few other ministers seem to want anything to do with it. Featherstone is also proud of the ringfenced central government funding for women \u2013 \u00a328m for domestic violence services and \u00a310.5m over three years for rape crisis services. Asked what her biggest achievement is, she cites the joint victory of herself and her boss at the Home Office, Theresa May: \"Ringfencing so much funding for the domestic violence agenda against the necessary austerity and economic situation left by Labour is a bloody miracle.\" The issue is a \"priority for the government and we want to send out a message to local authorities not to look on voluntary organisations and women's charities as a soft target\". This prioritising has not stopped local authorities cutting services to women, though. An interim report this week led by Vera Baird, the former Labour MP, found services offering help and counselling to battered women have had their funding cut by 31% since the coalition came to power in May 2010. Have women been hardest hit in this recession? \"Women are affected by the cuts, just as everybody is,\" says Featherstone, \"but as a Liberal Democrat in a coalition trying to do the right thing with the biggest deficit in peacetime Britain, we have done everything to protect the vulnerable, particularly women.\" Baird is scathing about her erstwhile counterpart on the equalities bill. \"I want good services for women. I don't want it to all go backwards. It would be better if I sent the report to Theresa May. She can at least make decisions, and understands it a bit.\" Featherstone is by all accounts an effective and popular constituency MP in the north London suburb of Hornsey and Wood Green, despite a hiccup over tuition fees. \"There was a few weeks when I wasn't their favourite popular princess,\" is how she puts it, but \"it's fine on the doorstep now.\" Featherstone is known to have inherited part of family business Ryness, but denies rumours of great wealth. \"I've always had to work for my living \u2026 If I'm wealthy it's because I have a nice house, like most people in London.\" A divorcee, she is often described as \"nice\" by lobby hacks and politicians, and brought up two children singlehanded. She has not been afraid to criticise the government's plans to introduce a \"marriage tax\" to benefit couples, and has spoken out on how lucky happy couples seemed She is also unafraid of talking up about male dominance in Westminster \u2013 she is one of just seven female Liberal Democrat MPs. \"David Cameron, Nick Clegg \u2013 if you're listening, you've said a lot of good things. Now let's see some action,\" she calls into my dictaphone. After nearly an hour, it's clear Lynne Featherstone does herself no favours as a political interviewee. Theresa May has won more plaudits for her work on equalities. Yet by scoffing at Featherstone and marginalising her impact, we risk marginalising the issues on which she works, which is perhaps what the government wants us to do. So it is hard not to support her in a difficult role. But as I walk out of the room and she says, \"The future is bright, the future is women,\" I can't help but grimace.",

      "body": "<p>What to make of&#xa0;Lynne Featherstone? This Liberal Democrat MP is&#xa0;one of a tiny handful of women in government; she is dedicated to tackling violence against women internationally, and is a feminist who has spoken up for equality and women's rights. What's not&#xa0;to like? Yet few ministers suffer such&#xa0;a bad rep, not just from Conservatives, but the very women's groups who fought so hard for her role to be created.</p> <p>Her tendency to go off on a tangent during debates, or say the wrong thing (<a href=\"http://issue.stylist.co.uk/Stylist-style-fashion-beauty-news/1I4bb0a43570ada012.cde/page/47\" title=\"\">\"there's nothing wrong with sex\"</a> when asked to comment on a pornographer-turned-candidate to a crowd of young feminists) has led to much name-calling.</p> <p>Some of the disappointment is political, of course. The fact she was elected on a liberal agenda, to work in a coalition that can seem anything but, makes her position more invidious than most. One rights campaigner compared her to Neville Chamberlain, \"waving around papers and policies while services [for women] are dying on their&#xa0;knees, as are women's wages and&#xa0;the value of women's economic contribution generally\".</p> <p>Still, I wonder how much of the criticism is fair. Is this just an example of&#xa0;women in power being held to a higher standard? Boris Johnson makes faux pas all the time and his popularity as an amiable buffoon just seems to increase. When Featherstone forgets what she wanted to ask after spending ages attracting the speakers' attention, the laughter is a little meaner.</p> <p>As the Guardian's women's editor, I&#xa0;want to support her, and will face charges of hypocrisy if I don't. But our&#xa0;previous meetings have not been encouraging. The last time I saw her at a&#xa0;public event, Featherstone was asked what powers the government had to encourage boards to appoint women. \"I&#xa0;have the power of all middle-aged women,\" she said without missing a beat, \"the power to nag.\" My&#xa0;heart sank.</p> <p>Am I just failing to see the joke? Am I&#xa0;becoming the po-faced feminazi the women's editor is expected to be? Surely the focus should be on her performance as equalities minister, a post that is an achievement in itself given that it took the government six months to decide to appoint someone to a job created by the last administration. An interview during International Women's week seemed the perfect opportunity to find out.</p> <p>Featherstone, 60, has had a busy week following a UN summit on the status of women in New York, in which she hosted an event on women's representation in the media and its impact on body confidence.

      "bodyText": "Spring is in the air, and doesn't everything seem just that little bit more manageable when the days start to lengthen and the sun comes out? Hal is coming up to two months now. He's properly smiling too, not just in that was-that-a-smile-or-was-it-a-fart? way, but genuine gummy beaming at his parents and sister. Catherine is still exclusively breastfeeding, which is impressive given what a glutton our son is. Fortunately, you can't over-breastfeed, otherwise we might have a problem with Hal. I was an ever hungry infant too, but I was bottle-fed after a couple of months. My mum's desperate desire to satisfy her ravenous child meant that by the age of three months I was so \"bonny\" I had to be taken into hospital for a week to be put on a diet. Yes, you'd never think it to look at me now, but I was a proper fatty as a baby and, watching the way Hal gulps down each feed as though he was starving, I can see how easy it would be to give him far more than he needs. The official age of recommended weaning seems to change all the time (it was three months when I was a baby, now it's six months) but I imagine Hal's going to need something more than breast milk sooner rather than later. For Catherine's sake if nothing else. I've been really busy at work this past couple of weeks, and I haven't been around at home as much as usual. When I am at home though, I'm much more focused on Georgia than Hal. He's still far too young to miss me when I'm not there, or even to notice my absence, but I feel it. It'd be nice to have the luxury of lying on the sofa, blissing out with my newborn son, but right now it's Georgia who needs my time and attention as she's still struggling a bit with the huge changes and chaos that a new baby brings. She'd been a bit grizzly and unsettled, so Cam and I (we spend most of our time at Catherine's at the moment) have started taking her back to our place a few times a week. As we arrived for the first time in ages, she squealed: \"We're home!\" followed by, \"I've missed you, Daddy \u2013 I love you so much!\" Suddenly she was back in a familiar situation. Nothing's changed at our place of course, there was no new baby, just Georgia and Daddy and Wawa (her name for Cam) getting on with it as normal. That night she slept for 12 hours (she's been waking up super-early) and woke up happy and relaxed. It's hard for Catherine too. I think she's really struggling with not being able to spend the quality one-to-one time with Georgia she's used to, but until Hal moves out of the \"on-demand\" stage of breastfeeding, Catherine is inevitably tied to him. Of course we adults know that this is just a temporary situation, that Hal will grow, become less dependent, and that things will balance out; but it's hard for a two-and-a-half year old to understand. Georgia adores her brother and loves to help look after him. I even found her walking round with her teddy propped against her shoulder while she patted his back to bring up his wind. But there's no doubt that her familiar world and well-ordered routine have gone up in smoke since he was born. It's not surprising that she's a bit unsettled. On reflection, I realise that if these are our biggest problems, we're doing OK. Are things a bit chaotic? Well, yes, we've got a new baby so it would be strange if they weren't. All in all, we've got very little to complain about. So, despite the chaos and the odd bump in the road, I'm trying to enjoy every moment. \u2022 Follow Charlie Condou on Twitter @charliecondou",

We are a strong team, all retired and in various states of health. We are very dutiful \u2013 none of us enjoys doing it and, while we admire qualities our mother has, we don't really like her. She was not a very caring mother: moody, spiteful, jealous and self-centred, and she has not changed. My dad was a very kind but ineffectual man and we were brought up in a prosperous, working-class home with holidays, treats and creature comforts, but not much affection. My brother says we all keep waiting for her love, returning like kicked dogs to their master \u2013 a rather harsh analogy, perhaps, but you get the point. I think the problem for us children is fear of her moods, which can change in minutes, and the complaints and moans that follow. In recent years, although she has an amazing memory, she has become paranoid, a form of age-onset dementia. She is very suspicious of us; we try not to provoke arguments, but it is very difficult when she blames \"the others\" for poisoning the milk, eating her chocolates, giving people keys, spoiling her clothes, etc. She insults us and forbids us to go, until she needs something, but she is manipulative and does not fall out with us all at once. We try strategies. She refuses carers and any decisions we try to make in her best interests are always rudely rejected. We are becoming more weary and less patient. I, for one, often \"the favourite\", am unable to move forward with any of this and am just waiting for her to die, which is not a very nice thing to think. We wait for a crisis \u2013 perhaps then she would have to go in a home \u2013 but how do we handle this now? It is spoiling all our lives. We have told the doctor but they do not get involved; my mother gets attendance allowance and she could afford to go into a home. Anon, via email Your line about \"waiting for a crisis; perhaps then she will go into a home\" is telling. This is clearly what you would like her to do, yet the guilt is paralysing you and your siblings. Even the most loving child who has had the greatest relationship with their mother can struggle to cope with an aged parent, especially one with early signs of dementia. (Has there been a formal diagnosis? I feel this may help focus you all.) Also, your mother going into a nursing home isn't sending her to jail. In January, I answered an email from a woman who was dreading her father going into a home. Although the situation was different to yours, the reader has kept in touch and told me how wonderful the nursing home is. I'm not advocating putting your mother into a home. But I do want you to think of it as a positive option. With specialist care, and being able to visit your mother without the burden of being her carer, it may ameliorate your relationship. That said, you cannot force your mother to go into a home if she can make her own decisions. What do your siblings think? How do you structure the help at the moment? Could you each take a week on at a time, so you only have to help her one week in four? I contacted Lucy Harmer, head of information and advice at Age UK (0800 1696565, ageuk.org.uk), who had this to say: \"This is very distressing but such difficult family circumstances aren't unusual. Both the mother and her children have different needs and they all need to be supported in different ways. It is important for children who are carers to separate their needs from those of their parents' and for siblings to think about how they can best support each other as well as their parent(s). \"Carers play a crucial role in society and they are eligible for a social services assessment, which may identify services such as respite support, which can help them cope. Carers can also get in touch with specialist agencies such as Carers Direct or Carers UK or a local support group.\" Your problems solved Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email\u2008annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

I wish more people would listen to him. His polar opposite is Steven Spielberg, and Schindler's List neatly embodies all Lanzmann's doubts. The documentary favours long takes, no heroes, and no war-crime footage whatsoever. The feature shows it all: random executions, gas chambers, the anguish of the doomed, but undercuts it all with a Spielbergian hunger for uplift and good guys. The Holocaust movie has taken some odd turns in the years since Shoah and Schindler established these parameters.

His gradual, almost grudging conversion to their salvation happens so subtly and slowly that it convinces us utterly. Lanzmann was right: you cannot successfully and honestly depict the Holocaust. No less a titan than Stanley Kubrick agreed when he deep-sixed his long-gestating Auschwitz movie, realising that even if it could be depicted with conviction and realism, no one sane would back it and no one sane would watch it. Far better and more digestible, then, is the Holland approach: use a fragment of the story to suggest the horror and enormity of the whole; look evil right in the face, but keep things to a human scale.

      "bodyText": "Two words said it all. Moments after winning a Golden Globe for his score for The Social Network last year, Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor tweeted \"Holy shit!\" Industrial rock singers aren't in the habit of winning Golden Globes for film scores, and certainly not their first one. But the landscape has changed in recent years \u2013 and is still doing so, fast. Two cinema releases this week alone have had their scores composed by singers: Sigur R\u00f3s' J\u00f3nsi has done the honours on Cameron Crowe's We Bought A Zoo, while Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh is responsible for 21 Jump Street. This is not an entirely new phenomenon: notably, Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler hit big with 1983's Local Hero, and Tim Burton changed Danny Elfman's life after plucking him from his band Oingo Boingo for 1985's Pee-wee's Big Adventure. However, boundaries are now being smashed by a generation of directors looking for entirely different sounds, and the likes of RZA, Underworld and Clint Mansell are providing them in spades. Today's film-makers, reared on rock, techno and everything in between, are looking for more contemporary aural accompaniments \u2013 a world away from the traditional orchestral set-up. And audiences' tastes have evolved with them, says Mothersbaugh, on the phone from his LA Mutato Muzika studio. \"There's obviously a place for traditional scoring,\" he says. \"But the palette of what people wanna hear has really opened up. And it's been beneficial to people who grew up on music through bands; it's given them much more of a voice.\" In many cases, it's the result of a director being a fan and mining the potential. David Fincher, who used NIN's instrumental Ghosts album as temporary music for The Social Network before hiring Reznor, said the decision was a no-brainer. Jim Jarmusch, who employed RZA for Ghost Dog: The Way Of A Samurai, was a Wu-Tang fan for years, while Joe Wright, a long-term Chemical Brothers fan, thought their sound lent itself perfectly to what he wanted for last year's Hanna. \"Someone from Sony called me,\" recalls Mothersbaugh of his score for Wes Anderson's debut film Bottle Rocket, \"and he said, 'This guy's really brilliant, but he's really hard to work with, he's driving the producers crazy and you're the only guy he'll talk to for scoring.'\" On The Life Aquatic, the pair sat together in Mutato, Mothersbaugh working on ideas while Anderson was still writing the film. \"He said, 'I'm thinking about putting a composer on this boat. Things haven't been going good for them, so they haven't bought any new equipment since 1979, what would that guy be writing music on?' And I said, 'Well that sounds quite Devo!' So we went downstairs and I found these old synths I'd written our albums on, fired them up, and that's where a lot of that came from, an old Oberheim TVS-1 that had this little 8-step sequencer.\" Directors are taking advantage of these artists' sensibilities. Cameron Crowe talks of J\u00f3nsi providing him with soundscapes he'd \"never had in a film before \u2013 bells, strings, cymbals, toy pianos, even melodies played through a small dictaphone\", while Jarmusch has said RZA told him to \"use hip-hop style\" with the music he gave him, to cut and change it as he saw fit. Australian director John Hillcoat, who has used Nick Cave to score all of his films, agrees that contemporary musicians offer something different. \"It depends on the band, there have been successes and failures,\" he says. \"There needs to be an understanding of that world, an intuitive connection to visual storytelling. Radiohead showed a real affinity to being bold with visual imagery, so it came as no surprise when Jonny Greenwood did There Will Be Blood.\" Hillcoat's also in LA, where he's completing Wettest County, a prohibition-era gangster drama starring Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy, and written by Cave. He and Cave have been collaborators since around 1980, when they were part of what Hillcoat says was a vibrant Melbourne scene, full of \"cross-fertilisation, where people were making short films, everyone could be in a band, everyone was intersecting.\" Since The Proposition, Cave has scored Hillcoat's films with long-term collaborator Warren Ellis, and Hillcoat says Wettest County is a departure for them. \"They've really extended themselves, it's very ambitious. It's using a lot of songs that are almost treated like score, and then there's score that's like songs.\" 'In film it's not a serious score unless it's orchestral; to me, that's bullshit. This is the mentality I'm fighting against' \u2013 Mike Patton, Faith No More The opportunity to move on creatively via a film score is a big pull for musicians. Sometimes they just want to get away. Clint Mansell told me in 2000 that he quit Pop Will Eat Itself because he was 33 and didn't feel comfortable with it any more; a chance meeting with Darren Aronofsky gave him his new career. Similarly, Massive Attack's 3D told State.ie that the Jet Li/Bob Hoskins film Danny The Dog \"wasn't the film you've been waiting all your life to do\" but the band wanted a break from making Massive Attack albums. \"More and more people are gravitating towards it, and it's no surprise,\" says Mothersbaugh. \"For me it seemed very logical that writing songs to go on the radio wasn't the be all and end all of being a music composer. Besides, having children really changed my perspective of touring. I dislike it so much now. Devo did 70 shows last year and I don't like being away from home that long because I've got a seven- and a 10-year-old. When you're 20, touring's really cool. When you're 60, not so much.\" With the record industry in flux, it's also beginning to look like a much safer career opportunity. \"Bands are actively seeking more film involvement,\" says Hillcoat. \"Because the days of recording albums and MTV, and even touring to some extent, are gone.\" But while the internet and digital revolution may not have made your local HMV very happy, technology has opened doors for artists. \"Now, you don't have to have orchestras,\" says Hillcoat. \"I've known [Trent Reznor's scoring partner] Atticus Ross from way back, and he can do that big-sounding stuff from DJ technology and sampling. He doesn't need the Hans Zimmer huge orchestra and what that costs any more.\" In most cases, the new breed has been welcomed with open arms by the open-minded, but that's not to say there's been no industry resistance. Faith No More's Mike Patton, who spewed up a delightfully noisy score for 2009's Crank 2 and is currently working on Derek Cianfrance's follow-up to Blue Valentine, told Scorenotes.com he'd faced some obstacles. \"In film music culture it's not a serious film music score unless it's orchestral, and to me, that's bullshit,\" he said. \"This is the mentality I'm fighting against. I'm a fuckin' rock guy. And I'm doing soundtrack music. I just think there's much more that can be done.\" When I spoke to Mothersbaugh he hadn't yet heard the final mix for his 21 Jump Street score. \"I know there were some people fighting,\" he says. \"I married electronics to orchestral in a way suggested by the directors, and they loved it, but I know there were other people at the mix who were tying to pull in as many of the elements of a Jerry Bruckheimer film as possible. I did do big bombastic orchestra stuff for chase scenes, but to them I think the electronic side was distracting.\" Daft Punk also married electronics to orchestral for Tron: Legacy but, before they began, Disney sent them to meet a handful of more traditional A-list composers. And when they were asked who they'd like to work with, they stood their ground and said they'd do it themselves. I ask Hillcoat if, as each of his films have attracted bigger-budget stars, he had encountered any similar concerns about Cave. He hasn't, he says, to some extent because Cave's writing work on The Proposition earned him a lot of respect. \"But you're right,\" he says, \"the bigger the budget, the more these discussions take place. When we did The Road there were some unusual conversations about a power ballad being written by someone else, but that wasn't really appropriate to the film, and we won. There will still be the odd note from financiers: 'too dark.' It sorts itself out by the nature of the material. There will always be that struggle between art and commerce, but so far we've been quite fortunate in winning out.\" Long may they continue.",

      "bodyText": "At a cost of \u00a39m the worst pub in Buckinghamshire is open again and ready to receive guests. However, the National Trust has not been entirely authentic in its restoration of the 18th-century New Inn at Stowe. The fires are burning again in the grates, the beer barrels are ready in the tap room and the sheets are hanging in the laundry, but the fleas, the rats, the filth, the wallpaper breathing arsenic fumes from walls mouldy with damp, the dreadful food and the even worse beds are gone. Lord Cobham built the New Inn in 1717 to feed and water visitors to the extraordinary front garden at his palatial home at Stowe: 250 acres studded with temples, columns, arches, obelisks, cascades, grottoes, and lakes. The lakes were a three-dimensional allegory of liberal politics, with the Temple of Modern Virtue a deliberately tottering ruin sheltering only a headless bust of Louis XIV, and the Temple of British Worthies glorifying a motley crew including Isaac Newton, Elizabeth I, John Locke and Walter Raleigh. \"It was, then as now, the most important landscape garden in Europe, designed as a riposte to Versailles,\" said Richard Wheeler, the National Trust garden historian. \"It was all intended to ensure that the attentive visitor would never in their future life even contemplate voting Tory \u2013 though there is no evidence that this ever worked.\" Visitors flocked to a garden which Wheeler described as \"a theme- park-style tourist attraction of its time\". The inn, which also served as a pub for locals and estate workers, was built to cater for visitors who were well enough off to arrive by stage coach or post chaise and pay 6d for a guidebook without which they had no hope of making sense of the garden, but were not grand enough to be invited to stay in the house. Cobham leased his pub to various landlords. Complaints from early guests, traced by an archaeologist, Gary Marshall, were vituperative. One visitor said that none of his party had been able to sleep a wink from the \"fleas and gnats\". Another moaned about \"bad beds and worse eating\". Marshall has also established that the cellars regularly flooded disastrously: he began his own work in the building standing in a foot of foetid water. The complaints ended after the inn changed hands in the late 18th century and was considerably smartened up. By the end of the 19th century, when the gardens had bankrupted their owners and been stripped of many features, the New Inn had become a farm house. The National Trust began an epic restoration of the gardens 20 years ago, but with the big house now one of the grander public schools, it had to operate from a glorified garden shed. The trust bought the New Inn from the last private owners in 2005, when the roof was falling in, the floors had collapsed and the weed-choked yard was a graveyard of abandoned farm machinery. During the restoration, which was done with the help of a \u00a31.5m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, volunteers cleaned and recycled 128,000 roof tiles, revealing some startling obscenities scrawled by Georgian workmen. A new barn-like building, replacing one beyond restoration, was built to house a shop and cafe. Admission to the restored historic rooms is free but, as in the 18th century, visitors can buy tickets to make their way down a farm track, ring a bell outside the Temple of Friendship and apply to walk the paths of virtue or vice. So far the only complaints have been about the queues for cream teas.",
