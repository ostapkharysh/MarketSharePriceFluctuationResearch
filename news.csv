BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China’s State Council has temporarily lifted a ban on the sale of foreign games consoles, paving the way for firms like Sony Corp, Microsoft Corp  and Nintendo Co Ltd to enter a multi-billion dollar video game market.

(Reuters) - South African Tim Clark pulled out of the Sony Open in Honolulu on Friday because of an elbow injury before he was scheduled to tee off in the second round. 
The 38-year-old, who was runner-up at the event last year after closing with a seven-under-par 63 at Waialae Country Club, had carded an opening 73 on Thursday. 
Clark’s only PGA Tour victory came at the prestigious Players Championship in 2010, and he competed in only four events on the U.S. circuit the following year because of a lingering elbow injury.

MANILA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Philippine conglomerate San Miguel Corp will definitely list its power unit, SMC Global Power Holdings Corp, this year, its president said on Monday. 
The IPO of SMC Global, the country’s biggest power producer, has been shelved several times due to unfavourable market conditions. 
Ramon Ang also said San Miguel has no plans to increase its stake in Philippine Airlines (PAL). 
“I don’t think we will increase. San Miguel will only stick to 49 percent,” he told reporters, referring to the company’s current stake in Philippine Airlines 
San Miguel’s partner in PAL, Lucio Tan, has previously said he was open to sell all his remaining stake in the country’s flag carrier to both foreign and domestic buyers.

Jan 8 (Reuters) - A subcommittee of the powerful Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a hearing for Jan. 15 to discuss regulating Wall Street’s role in physical commodity markets. 
Among the witnesses scheduled to speak at the panel are top oversight officials with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and an official from the Federal Reserve’s banking supervision arm. 
The hearing comes as the Fed reconsiders exemptions given to banks since the early 2000s that allow them to engage in the previously prohibited trading of physical commodities.

NEW DELHI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - India has cancelled a $770 million helicopter deal with British-Italian company AgustaWestland after accusations it bribed officials, a top defence ministry official told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Defence Minister A.K. Anthony has said he did not believe AgustaWestland’s denial that it paid bribes to swing the deal for the purchase of 12 helicopters for top politicians. 
AgustaWestland, a division of Italian defence group Finmeccanica, denies any wrongdoing. A spokesman for India’s defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Six world powers and Iran have agreed to start implementing an interim nuclear deal on January 20, the EU’s foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said in a statement on Sunday. 
Ashton represents the six nations - the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany - in diplomatic contacts with Iran related to the nuclear standoff. 
She said the sides would now ask the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog to verify the deal’s implementation. 
“We will ask the IAEA to undertake the necessary nuclear-related monitoring and verification activities,” she said. 
Under the November 24 agreement, Iran has promised to curb its most sensitive nuclear activities in return for some relief from Western economic sanctions.

Jan 6 (Reuters) - Corinthian Colleges Inc said on Monday it received a letter from the U.S. consumer watchdog related to advertising, marketing or origination of private student loans.

The company said it would make a notice and opportunity to respond and advise (NORA) submission to the CFPB. 
“The company ... continues to believe that its acts and practices relating to student loans - financing that is essential to preserving our students’ access to post-secondary education - are lawful,” Corinthian said. () 
Corinthian’s shares were at $1.55 after the bell. They closed at $1.67 on the Nasdaq on Monday.
