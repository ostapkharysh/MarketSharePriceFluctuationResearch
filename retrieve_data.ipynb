      "The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own. \n",
      "A normalising world will not be a harmonious world. The massive fiscal and monetary stimulus that is helping revive GDP growth in developed economies favours the privileged directly, and trickles down only slowly to the middle classes, the poor and the unemployed. That tension will worsen. \n",
      "The trend to increased income inequality began long before the 2008 financial crisis. Income distributions in 17 member states from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development became more unequal between the mid-1980s and 2008, while there was no significant change in three. Inequality decreased in only two, Turkey and Greece. \n",
      "What happened after the crisis isn’t yet clear. But in the United States the very rich have done very well. The share of income taken by the top 1 percent of earners declined with the markets in 2008, according to Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley, but has rebounded. The upward trend, from 9 percent of total U.S. incomes in the early 1970s to about 20 percent before the crisis, has resumed. The inflation-adjusted income of the bottom 99 percent rose by only 0.4 percent between 2009 and 2012. \n",
      "Post-crisis low interest rates helped some poor borrowers, but penalised frugal small savers. In the United Kingdom, many workers who retired during the crisis were forced into taking abysmal annuity rates. At the bottom of the income ladder, unemployment has increased and welfare benefits have generally fallen. \n",
      "At the top, though, quantitative easing has produced gains on financial and real estate assets, especially for people rich enough to take the risks of leverage. Executive pay has continued to rise, and in the still extravagantly rewarded financial sector, the best remunerated have gained from a misguided regulatory assault on variable pay. \n",
      "Recovery is on the way, and some of the exceptional policies are set to be unwound in 2014. But the less well-off face more time out of work, more years in the workforce, and less real income and lower pensions than they would have expected before the crisis. A recovery that doesn’t feel like one will lead to an increasing sense of grievance. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "KINSHASA (Reuters) - The colonel in charge of military operations against insurgents in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo was killed on Thursday in an ambush by the ADF-NALU, a Ugandan rebel group, the government said. \n",
      "Colonel Mamadou Ndala, who helped to secure the military defeat of the powerful M23 rebel movement in November, died of his wounds after a rocket attack on his vehicle near the village of Mavivi in North Kivu province. \n",
      "His killing highlighted the challenge facing the Congolese government and a 21,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission in their efforts to pacify dozens of armed groups operating in the mineral-rich east of the vast central African nation. \n",
      "“Colonel Mamadou Ndala was killed in a ambush set by the ADF-NALU,” said a government statement read on state television. \n",
      "Ndala was in charge of tackling the ADF-NALU, which has stepped up its attacks in eastern Congo this year and has been identified by the U.N. mission as one of the main obstacles to peace. \n",
      "The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) emerged in the 1990s in opposition to the Ugandan government, allying itself with the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU). It was largely driven out of Uganda in the mid-2000s but has held out in eastern Congo. \n",
      "Government spokesman Lambert Mende said three other soldiers in the vehicle were also killed in the attack. Ndala was travelling without a military escort, he said. \n",
      "In the regional capital Goma, where many regarded the colonel as a hero for organizing the defense of the town from the M23 rebels, residents flocked to his home, locals said. Traffic was thin and many shops closed their shutters amid fears of protests. \n",
      "Millions of people have died in eastern Congo from violence, disease and hunger since the 1990s as foreign-backed insurgents have waged a series of rebellions, often for control of the region’s rich deposits of gold, diamonds and tin. \n",
      "ADF-NALU has been blamed for a spate of recent attacks and kidnappings around the town of Beni in North Kivu, including for the deaths of at least 60 civilians in two attacks last month. \n",

      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on their first day of trading in 2014 as investors booked profits in the wake of the S&P; 500’s best yearly advance since 1997. \n",
      "Shares of Apple Inc fell 1.3 percent to $555.59, leading a decline in technology stocks, after Wells Fargo cut its rating on the iPad and iPhone maker to “market perform” from “outperform”. Apple was the biggest drag on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes. \n",
      "The S&P; technology index fell 1 percent, the biggest decliner among the 10 major S&P; sectors. Among the stocks that fell the most Thursday were those that had enjoyed the best gains in 2013, including Netflix, which was down 1.6 percent at $362.45, and Micron Tech Inc, which was off 0.9 percent at $21.56. \n",
      "Netflix was the biggest gainer of last year with a hefty return of 296.4 percent while Micron Tech skyrocketed 236 percent, according to data by Schaeffer’s Investment Research. \n",
      "Conversely, last year’s biggest losers were among those that racked up the best gains on Thursday. Newmont Mining Corp  was up 3.8 percent at $23.91 after losing 51 percent in value in 2013. \n",
      "The S&P; 500 closed 2013 with a spectacular 29.6 percent gain for the year, its best annual performance since 1997, adding $3.75 trillion in market value. The Dow  surged 26.5 percent in its best year since 1995. The Nasdaq  jumped 38.3 percent, its best year since 2009. \n",
      "“Though few market forecasters expect 2014 market performance to exceed 2013, historical patterns suggest that we could see performance similar to other bull markets that have lasted into the fifth year,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \n",
      "Global stock markets were mixed Thursday after weaker Chinese manufacturing data suggested the world’s second-largest economy might be slowing. \n",
      "An index of U.S. factory activity stood at 57.0 last month, in line with economists’ forecast but a touch below November’s 2-1/2-year high of 57.3. \n",
      "Other data included weekly initial claims which slipped for a second week, to 339,000, suggesting labor market conditions continued to steadily improve. In another sign of economic improvement, financial data firm Markit said its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 55.0 in December, beating November’s 54.7 reading. \n",
      "The Dow Jones industrial average fell 141.6 points or 0.85 percent, to 16,435.06, the S&P; 500 lost 17.71 points or 0.96 percent, to 1,830.65 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 38.688 points or 0.93 percent, to 4,137.902. \n",
      "In a note to clients, Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup, boosted his year-end 2014 target for the S&P; 500 to 1,975 from 1,900, citing earnings progress as the primary driver. \n",

      "Sharpshooters to renew deer cull in heart of Washington D.C.\n",
      "Preview: Kings at Blues\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sharpshooters will renew culling the white-tailed deer population, growing fast in the heart of the U.S. capital, as early as Thursday night, the National Park Service said. \n",
      "The nighttime hunts by Department of Agriculture shooters in Washington’s Rock Creek Park will continue until March 31, or until 106 deer have been killed, said Nick Bartolomeo, the park’s chief of resources management. \n",
      "The general public should remain out of harm’s way because joggers and cyclists are generally barred from the park after dark, according to the park service. \n",
      "The sharpshooters will deploy on unspecified nights as early as Thursday, when the 12-mile-long (19-km-long) park is normally closed. Park roads will also be temporarily closed as a safety precaution. \n",
      "The three-year program is aimed at reducing the deer population to 15 to 20 per square mile (six to eight per square km) from 77 per square mile (31 per square km), Bartolomeo said during a conference call with reporters. \n",
      "The first cull took place in March 2013, when 20 deer were killed in one night, he said. \n",
      "The number of deer has soared in the last 20 years, with the animals eating nearly all the park’s tree seedlings and preventing the forest from growing, according to a statement from the Park Service. \n",
      "“There are no historic records of a white-tailed deer population in Rock Creek Park before 1960,” said Park Superintendent Tara Morrison. \n",
      "The deer meat will be donated to food banks and organizations for the homeless. \n",
      "The number of U.S. white-tailed deer has exploded from a few hundred thousand in the 1930s to an estimated 30 million presently. The growth has been blamed on a lack of predators and growth of deer-friendly residential areas outside cities. \n",

      "Jaden Schwartz and the St. Louis Blues are on quite the roll, while the Los Angeles Kings are trending in the other direction. The Kings look to end Schwartz’s six-game goal-scoring streak and snap their four-game skid when they visit the Blues on Thursday. Los Angeles suffered a 5-2 setback to Dallas on Dec. 23 before dropping its third straight one-goal decision with a 3-2 loss to the Stars on Tuesday. \n",
      "St. Louis posted its third straight victory on Tuesday, a 2-1 triumph over Minnesota. T.J. Oshie, who was named to the United States Olympic roster on Wednesday, also tallied as the Blues improved to 8-1-2 in their last 11 games. Brian Elliott will get the nod on Thursday after turning aside 24 shots to improve to 6-0-1 with a 1.67 goals-against average in December. \n",
      "TV: 8 p.m. ET, FSW (Los Angeles), FSMW (St. Louis) \n",
      "ABOUT THE KINGS (25-12-4): Captain Dustin Brown and Jonathan Quick were given a chance to improve upon their silver medal-winning performance in 2010 when they were named to the Team USA roster on Wednesday. “What I always say about the Olympics (is) it’s another level,” Brown told the Los Angeles Times. “Doing it in 2010, going into it, you really didn’t know what to expect at the Olympics. It’s an awesome tournament, just a really fun thing to be a part of.” Quick is nursing a groin injury but is expected to participate when the Americans travel to Sochi, Russia. \n",

      "The Dallas Stars look to carry over their strong play from December when they host the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday. Montreal is 2-2-1 on its six-game road trip, while Dallas stands two points out of a playoff position as it looks to extend its point streak to eight games (5-0-2). “I think we know our identity, and that’s to be good defensively and use our team speed when we have a chance,” Stars center Rich Peverley told the Dallas Morning News. “There’s not a lot of teams in the league that can skate with us.” \n",
      "The Stars capped the 2013 portion of the schedule Tuesday with their second victory over Los Angeles in eight days as former Canadien Erik Cole scored twice.

Montreal could be tiring a bit on the defensive end or opening up too much to break out of its scoring doldrums as it has allowed 18 goals over the first five games of its road trip.

      "Early spotlight on Portugal, France in new credit ratings calendar\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - Europe’s new calendar for sovereign credit ratings, an EU measure to shine a light on the actions of ratings agencies, will in its busy first few weeks thrust the market spotlight on bailed-out Portugal and recently downgraded France. \n",
      "European Union rules came into force this month requiring Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch and other credit ratings agencies that operate in Europe for the first time to lay out the dates on which they review a country’s rating. \n",
      "They could previously conduct and publish their market-moving reviews at a time of their own choosing and were accused by euro zone officials of exacerbating the region’s debt crisis by downgrading the ratings of struggling countries at critical moments. \n",
      "The rules are part of a raft of increased regulation on the agencies, which also came under fire for underestimating the risks of mortgage-related securities in the run-up to the 2007/08 global financial crisis. \n",
      "All of the big three firms left it right until the year-end deadline to publish their calendars, resulting in a number of busy schedule periods that could make for volatile markets. \n",
      "Mid-April looks particularly hectic; DBRS, a smaller Toronto-based firm, decides on the 11th whether or not to downgrade Italy and Spain, and Fitch does the same two weeks later. \n",
      "If DBRS cuts one or both of them to B-grade territory it would mean their sovereign bonds would automatically be worth 5 percent less when swapped for cheap funding at the European Central Bank. \n",
      "Before that, January gets the new system off with a bang. Moody’s reviews Portugal, which is still working through its EU/IMF bailout, on the 10th. S&P; follows suit on the 17th, the same day Moody’s looks at Ireland, which emerged from its bailout last month, and Fitch casts the slide rule over the Netherlands. \n",
      "On the 24th Moody’s moves on to both the UK, one of the fastest-growing industrialized nations, and France, which is under threat of another downgrade, before February’s headline date of the 14th, when it reviews Italy, the euro zone’s second most indebted state relative to GDP. \n",
      "“The first few months of the year will be quite busy,” said Citi analyst Nishay Patel. “In the first quarter, there are eight publication dates for European sovereigns who currently have a negative outlook by either S&P; or Moody’s.” \n",
      "The new rules are intended to make the ratings process more transparent and reduce the clout of the big three firms, but some policymakers warn they risk creating what one recently called a “downgrade diary” that traders could use to bet against vulnerable states. \n",
      "Some also wonder whether countries might try to game the new system by delaying bad news until just after the review dates. \n",
      "The rating firms will only be able to make changes outside the pre-set timetable in extreme cases, for example if a government falls or its finances undergo a significant change, for which the agency must provide a detailed explanation. \n",
      "Ratings have to be published on a Friday either an hour before or after market hours. \n",
      "One quirk of the new rules is that if a country in another part of the world is rated by an analyst based in Europe, those ratings are also subject to the new requirements. \n",
      "For S&P; that is roughly half the 127 countries it rates and includes most of Africa and the Middle East, and the story is similar for both Moody’s and Fitch. \n",

      "* Exports will only start with Baghdad’s consent \n",
      "* Turkey hopes for agreement this month \n",
      "* Initial volume seen at 300,000 bpd \n",
      "By Orhan Coskun \n",
      "ANKARA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Crude oil from Iraqi Kurdistan has started flowing via a new pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean export hub of Ceyhan but will not be shipped to world markets without the consent of Baghdad, Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said on Thursday. \n",
      "Yildiz hopes a deal can be reached this month for exports to begin, he told a news conference in Ankara. \n",
      "Flows through the pipeline would start at 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) and rise to 400,000, he said. \n",
      "Turkey signed a multi-billion-dollar energy package late last year with Iraqi Kurdistan (KRG) under which the semi-autonomous region plans independent energy exports via Turkey. \n",
      "Kurdistan could eventually export some 2 million bpd of oil to world markets and at least 10 billion cubic metres per year of gas to Turkey. \n",
      "Its bid to export oil and gas independently from Baghdad has infuriated officials in the Iraqi capital, which claims sole authority to manage Iraqi oil. \n",
      "Turkey has been working to get the central government on board before exports start. \n",
      "“The flow of crude oil from Iraq has begun. It is being stored. It will not be exported without the consent of the Iraqi government,” Yildiz told the news conference. \n",
      "The Turkish-KRG deal has significance for major oil companies as well as for the Kurds and Turkey, which stand to  benefit from domestic supply and onward westward export through Ceyhan. \n",
      "Kurdistan has struck deals with ExxonMobil, Chevron  and Total among others as it seeks to develop its energy industry. \n",
      "Ankara has set up the Turkish Energy Company (TEC), a state-backed entity which has struck partnership deals with Exxon and will be Turkey’s counterparty in dealings with Kurdistan. \n",
      "Yildiz visited Baghdad in December for talks with Iraq’s Deputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani, who has long opposed Turkey’s courtship of the Kurdish region. \n",
      "Baghdad says Kurdish efforts towards oil independence could lead to the break-up of Iraq, but Turkey has repeatedly said it respects Iraq’s sensitivities over territorial integrity and that increasing oil revenues will help the whole of the country.\n",

      "Stalingrad is the center of action in one of the world's great novels, Vasily Grossman's “Life and Fate.” Grossman, a Soviet war correspondent, spent months in Stalingrad in 1942 under constant bombardment. The description he gives of those who defended it against the encircling Wehrmacht is of a struggle, often hand-to-hand, across a ruined city between the troops of two totalitarian states. It was the war's central turning point when the Red Army broke its hold on the encirclement. \n",
      "Five years after Joseph Stalin fell from favor in 1956, Stalingrad become Volgograd. On Sunday bombs hit the city’s train station and a trolleybus, killing more than 30 people. There is a kind of symmetry in this attack and those that had reduced Stalingrad to rubble. The preservation of the city took a near suicidal feat of arms on the part of the Red Army, which in turn saved the Soviet Union. The bombings in Volgograd were Islamist suicide attacks, and they are likely to be a critical point in the slow death of the Soviet empire. \n",
      "The passing of great empires can last for many years, and often decades. The effects of the withdrawal of the British, French and Austro-Hungarian empires from the vast territories they once commanded can still be felt. The Soviet Union collapsed in the late 1980s without a civil war like the one that nearly killed the new Soviet state between 1918-21. There have been, however, major conflicts in Chechnya, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Uzbekistan, Moldova, Kyrgizia and a full-on, if brief, invasion of Georgia by Russia. Only the first and the last of these have been extensively covered by journalists. The attack in Volgograd signals that there are more conflicts to come. \n",
      "Islamist-inspired terrorism is now Russia’s most urgent problem. It threatens to stop the Winter Olympic Games that are set to take place in Sochi -- a few hundred miles from Volgograd -- in  six weeks. In a July video message, Doku Umarov, who styles himself as \"Emir\" of the North Caucasus, enjoined others to \"use maximum efforts on the path of Allah to do everything possible to disrupt these demonic dances on the bones of our ancestors.\" \n",
      "There are many who already see the Olympics and other grossly inflated sports occasions as nationalist posturing, and may even agree with their description as \"demonic dances.\" But the more telling phrase in the video is the \"bones of our ancestors.\" Umarov, a shrewd and ruthless man, is tending a fire that he hopes will become a conflagration across Russia. The Soviet Union buried the bones of many ancestors -- most of these in the Stalin era -- in the North Caucasus, the ethnically heterogeneous, mountainous region in Russia's south. Various tribes there were pounded into submission through terror, deportation and a brutal semi-modernization of their economies. \n",
      "Violence is growing in the republics of Dagestan and Ingushetia, as well as in Chechnya, where all resistance was thought to have been wiped out after the second Chechen war was won by Russia. One of the first suspects of the suicide bombing of Volgograd's train station was Oksana Aslanda -- from the Tabasaran ethnic group in Dagestan, the members of which are Sunni Muslims. The group has been known for the current world champion pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, whose father is a Tabasaran. Isinbayeva and Aslanda illuminate the tragedy of the North Caucasus; half enfolded into Russian society (Isinbayeva's mother is Russian) and half pulled toward the claims of its ancestors' bones and toward extreme forms of a once-marginalized religion. \n",
      "These groups are attracting Russians who are excited by their militancy and eager for an ideology that replaces the moral and ideological emptiness of modern Russia. Pavel Pechyonkin, an ethnic Russian and former paramedic from Dagestan, is the only suspect in the second Volgograd bomb in a trolleybus. In response to his parents’ pleas to end his dedication to terrorism, he responded that Allah had commanded him and, \"Why shouldn't we leave their children orphans?\" \n",
      "For Umarov, who wants to shift ethnic resentment from the passive to the active, the framework of resistance is Islamist jihad. Elsewhere it is more civic. The Ukrainian demonstrations in favor of an agreement with the European Union largely ended in mid-December, when Vladimir Putin promised cheap gas and financial aid in return for a continued allegiance to Russian geopolitics and possible membership in a Eurasian customs union. But the savage beating of the investigative journalist Tatyana Chernovol, who had been posting online photographs of the extensive estate of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich, re-ignited mass protests in Kiev over Christmas. \n",
      "Putin’s nostalgia for the Soviet Union meets a ready response in some regions: Volgograd’s city council has proposed changing its name back to Stalingrad and has retained the Stalin-era names for city districts. The district in which the trolleybus was bombed is called Dzerzhinsky, after the first boss of the Soviet secret police, which became the KGB. For many Russians, continued imperial sovereignty over the neighboring states is still a natural state, but one that is now challenged by terrorist and civic movements. \n",
      "The reconstitution of an empire as anything stronger than a benign and powerless shadow is impossible. Once political elites have acquired their own power and national sentiment pulls the country away from the imperial center — as has happened in the former Soviet Baltic states, Moldova, Georgia and is now happening in Ukraine — the empire is lost. \n",
      "The Sochi Olympics will take place among the highest tension. The area will be flooded with secret service and other troops for dignitaries, athletes and spectators, who will be nervous about an atrocity. For all the lavishness of Putin’s $50 billion Olympic splurge, the events will take place not just on the bones of ancestors, but on the still crumbling infrastructure of a Soviet empire that money and hard power cannot rebuild. Russia needs to show that it is ready for a post-imperial era. Unfortunately, Putin is not the man to usher it in. \n",

      "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Older women with a history of heart trouble were more likely to develop thinking and memory problems than those without heart disease, it was found in a new study. \n",
      "Women who’d had a heart attack, in particular, were twice as likely to see declines in their thinking and memory skills, researchers found. \n",
      "Doctors had already suspected such a link existed, lead author Dr. Bernhard Haring told Reuters Health. \n",
      "“But our study provides new evidence on a broad scale including many different types of heart disease with a specific focus on postmenopausal women,” he said. \n",
      "Haring is based at the Comprehensive Heart Failure Center at the University of Würzburg in Germany. \n",
      "He and his colleagues used data from a long-term study of more than 6,000 women ages 65 to 79. \n",
      "Researchers asked the women if they had ever been diagnosed with any heart problems. They also gave them a test of brain function at the beginning of the study and then once every year. \n",
      "None of the women had thinking and memory problems at the outset. Close to 900 reported having heart disease. \n",
      "About eight years later, more than 400 women showed signs of cognitive decline or dementia. Women who said they’d had heart disease were 29 percent more likely to have cognitive problems than those without heart disease. \n",
      "Women who’d had a heart attack had the highest risk of developing thinking and memory trouble, the researchers reported in the Journal of the American Heart Association. \n",
      "Those with a history of bypass surgery or peripheral vascular disease - hardening of the arteries that bring blood to the legs and feet - were also at greater risk, Haring said. \n",
      "But neither an abnormal heart rhythm nor heart failure was linked to a decline in brain function. \n",
      "Regardless of whether women had heart disease, those with high blood pressure and diabetes had a higher risk of cognitive decline. But no link was seen with obesity. \n",
      "The new study is important because of the sheer number of women involved, Dr. Richard O’Brien said. He is chairman of Neurology at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, and wasn’t involved in the research. \n",
      "Understanding the connection between heart disease and dementia is important because heart disease is reversible but Alzheimer’s disease is not, O’Brien said. \n",
      "“Given that the number of individuals suffering from dementia is increasing in all developed countries, it is important and necessary to first investigate the reasons of why this is happening and to identify those particularly at risk and second to find measures on how to prevent and treat affected individuals,” Haring said. \n",
      "An aging circulatory system could lead to worsening brain function in many ways, he said. Gradual buildup of plaque in the veins and arteries or inflammation may play a role, as could small bits of tissue death in the brain over time due to poor blood supply. \n",
      "“Heart disease is more than just blocked arteries, it’s an inflammatory process as well and also affects the turnover of brain endothelial cells, cerebrospinal fluid production (which washes away bad things in the brain) - lots of things,” O’Brien told Reuters Health in an email. “Which exactly is the most important nobody knows.” \n",
      "About 35 percent of people over age 80 have dementia, he noted. \n",
      "Women with any kind of heart disease should see their doctor on a regular basis, Haring said. \n",
      "“Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and in particular diabetes should be managed adequately as these may provide a link between (heart disease) and worsening cognitive functioning over time,” Haring said. \n",

      "Italy can breach EU deficit limits if it reforms, Renzi says\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "ROME (Reuters) - Italy can negotiate a relaxation of European Union deficit limits if it shows it is serious about effective reforms to its economy and political system, Matteo Renzi, the new head of the center-left Democratic Party said in an interview on Thursday. \n",
      "Renzi is not in the government but as head of the biggest party in Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s left-right coalition, he will have a decisive role to play in shaping the political agenda and has already called for quicker action on reforms. \n",
      "“If there’s a leadership with a vision, I can’t see a problem with passing the deficit ceiling, although we’d have to have a battle to change the rules,” he told the daily Fatto Quotidiano. \n",
      "Despite its worst recession since World War Two, Italy has managed to bring its deficit within the EU’s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product, at the cost of deep public resentment at the tax hikes and other austerity measures required to meet the target. \n",
      "Renzi, the 38-year-old mayor of Florence who won a sweeping victory in his party primary last month to assume leadership of the center-left, said the 3 percent deficit ceiling was a mark of the lack of vision which had pushed Europe into crisis. \n",
      "“It’s obvious you can exceed it; it’s an anachronistic limit which dates back 20 years,” he said. \n",
      "He said Italy had to show it was ready to reform its constitution, to cut the bloated cost of its political system, and pass a Jobs Act capable of attracting international investors along with other reforms. \n",
      "If it did so, “Europe will applaud, even if you breach the 3 percent. Europe needs a living Italy.” \n",
      "Renzi’s comments contrast in tone with the position of Letta, who has said repeatedly that Italy’s budget discipline had ensured it regained international credibility and lowered its borrowing costs. \n",
      "However he “categorically” rejected the euro skepticism of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, whose leader Beppe Grillo has proposed a referendum on leaving the euro. \n",
      "“Leaving the euro would have decidedly negative repercussions for Italians, it would send interest rates shooting up, it would make it more difficult for companies to work and it would weaken family purchasing power even more,” he said. “I’m open to a discussion but I disagree with it in substance.” \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - An exiled former Rwandan intelligence chief was found murdered in a Johannesburg hotel room, police said on Thursday, in a killing a Rwandan opposition party blamed on the country’s government. \n",
      "Patrick Karegeya, who once headed military intelligence in his homeland, fled to South Africa in 2007 after allegedly plotting a coup against President Paul Kagame with former Rwandan army chief Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, who was also exiled there. \n",
      "Karegeya body was discovered on New Year’s Day on a bed at Michelangelo Towers, an upscale hotel and apartment complex he had apparently booked in to three days earlier, South African police said. \n",
      "His neck was swollen and a bloody towel and rope were found in the room’s safe, they said. \n",
      "Paul Ramakolo, a spokesman for South Africa’s Hawks, an elite crime fighting unit, confirmed Karegeya had been killed. “We will check if it was as a result of strangulation or what could be the factor,” he said. \n",
      "The opposition Rwanda National Congress, many of whose senior members are also living in exile, described Karegeya’s death as an assassination. \n",
      "“By killing its opponents, the criminal regime in Kigali seeks to intimidate and silence the Rwandan people into submission,” it said. \n",
      "A spokesperson for the Rwandan presidency declined to comment and it was not possible to reach Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo or spokespeople at the Rwandan embassy in Pretoria. \n",
      "Rwanda’s ambassador to South Africa, Vincent Karega, earlier told local radio SAFM he was not aware of details of the killing. “We encourage the authorities to really look into the matter so that we know exactly what happened,” he said. \n",
      "Nyamwasa was shot in the stomach in 2010 as he drove into the driveway of his upmarket Johannesburg home. He survived what his family said was an assassination attempt ordered by Kagame. \n",
      "Both Nyamwasa and Karegeya, who was 53, fought alongside Kagame in Rwanda’s 1994 war, which halted the genocide by ethnic Hutu militia who had killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in just three months. \n",
      "In 2011, South Africa declined a Rwandan request to extradite Nyamwasa to his homeland. He was also wanted in Spain and France for killings in the 1990s. \n",
      "Also in 2011, a Rwandan military court sentenced Karegeya, Nyamwasa and two other exiled officers to 20 years in prison for threatening state security after they were tried in absentia. \n",

      "MILAN (Reuters) - Italian defense group Finmeccanica SIFI.MI said on Thursday its AgustaWestland unit welcomed a decision by the Indian government to take part in an arbitration process over a $770 million helicopter deal, but warned of possible job cuts. \n",
      "On Wednesday India cancelled a deal to buy 12 AW101 helicopters from AgustaWestland over what it termed a breach of integrity, but agreed to participate in an arbitration process. \n",
      "“AgustaWestland ... confirms having received yesterday from India’s Ministry of Defense notification concerning the appointment of an arbitrator from its side,” Finmeccanica said in a statement. \n",
      "The state-controlled defense group said it did not believe either the contract termination notice issued by the Indian Defense Ministry or the “show cause notice” provided an adequate basis for taking action against AgustaWestland. \n",
      "It added however it remained committed to working with the Indian government to resolve the issues. \n",
      "“AgustaWestland... is ready to perform the remaining obligations under the agreement for the supply of the 12 VVIP/VIP helicopters,” it said. \n",
      "India froze payments for the AW101 helicopters after Finmeccanica’s then-chief executive was arrested in February for allegedly paying bribes to secure the deal. \n",
      "Finmeccanica however said its AgustaWestland unit was ready to put into action a plan, already drawn up, to mitigate risks. \n",
      "“This plan includes a cut in the work force to redefine the business model of the company and a reallocation of working capital with impacts on the company’s supply chain,” it said. \n",

      "Skinner’s hat trick helps Hurricanes to OT victory \n",
      "WASHINGTON — Carolina Hurricanes center Jeff Skinner was one of the hottest players in the NHL in December with a league-high 12 goals. \n",
      "He started off the New Year exactly where he left off, scoring a hat trick, including the game-winner in overtime, in the Hurricanes’ 4-3 victory over the Washington Capitals on Thursday night at the Verizon Center. \n",
      "“Goal scorers can go on streaks and he’s certainly on a nice streak,” Hurricanes coach Kirk Muller said. “You give him the opportunity and he’s certainly going to capitalize.” \n",
      "Skinner scored two goals in regulation and netted his third of the game 1:20 into the extra period when he converted a 3-on-1, tapping a perfect cross-ice feed from defenseman Ryan Murphy past Capitals rookie goaltender Philipp Grubauer. \n",
      "“It’s a great pass,” Skinner said after his second hat trick of the season. “He sort of threads it through [Mike Green’s] legs. A great play by him.” \n",
      "The win was the second in a row for the Hurricanes (16-16-9), who had won just two of their previous 10 games. \n",
      "It also moved the Hurricanes within five points of the Capitals, who lost for the fifth time in six games (1-2-3). \n",
      "“At the end of the day, we have [two] points in our last three games,” Caps winger Troy Brouwer said, “and it’s not good enough in a tight division.” \n",
      "Hurricanes goalie Anton Khudobin turned aside 38 shots for the win. He was making his first start since Oct. 13. Grubauer stopped 29 shots in his third straight loss. \n",
      "After a relatively quiet first period in which the Hurricanes took a 1-0 lead on a 5-on-3 power-play goal by Skinner, both teams showed their offensive firepower in the second period, scoring five goals in a span of 4:34. \n",
      "“I don’t want to say bad words,” Khudobin said, “but sometimes it happens.” \n",
      "The Capitals started the game with right winger Alex Ovechkin on a four-game scoring drought and playing on the second line. Ovechkin began the second-period barrage 49 seconds in when he rumbled down the right wing, used defenseman Ron Hainsey as a screen and pumped a shot high over Khudobin’s glove for his league-best 31st goal of the season. \n",
      "The Canes regained the lead 55 seconds later when center Manny Malhotra went top shelf on Grubauer for his third goal of the season. The Caps responded at 3:02 when Brouwer, promoted to the top line in place of Ovechkin, backhanded a Nicklas Backstrom rebound under the crossbar for his ninth goal of the season. \n",
      "Just 38 seconds later, Ovechkin was awarded a penalty shot when Carolina defenseman Justin Faulk hauled him down on a breakaway. Ovechkin ran out of room on his deke attempt and Khudobin poke-checked it away to leave the Capitals captain 2-of-9 in career shootout attempts. \n",

      "BANGKOK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Thai stocks and the baht currency tumbled on Thursday as uncertainty deepened about a February election that anti-government forces are determined to block in their bid to oust Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. \n",
      "The benchmark index dropped 2.7 percent to a four-month low of 1,263.72 before the midday break and the baht  lost for a 10th straight day against the dollar. Investors are worried a Feb. 2 poll will not go ahead, leaving Yingluck’s government exposed to prolonged attacks by opponents. \n",
      "National Security Council chief Paradorn Pattanatabut said on Thursday security agencies were considering declaring a state of emergency after protesters said they would try to “shut down” the capital from Jan. 13. \n",
      "“The situation has intensified,” Paradorn told Reuters. “We may need to call for tougher measures and security agencies have planned for that.” \n",
      "The latest bout of political tumult erupted in November after a blunder by the ruling Puea Thai Party, which tried to push through an unpopular amnesty bill that would have annulled the jail sentence of Yingluck’s self-exiled brother and former premier, Thaksin Shinawatra, the divisive tycoon at the heart of eight years of on-off conflict. \n",
      "Protesters say Yingluck is a puppet of Dubai-based Thaksin, who they call a corrupt crony capitalist who has subverted a democratic system that needs to be suspended and overhauled. \n",
      "Backed by Bangkok’s conservative elite, their broader aim is to neutralise the power of Thaksin’s political juggernaut, rooted among the rural poor in the populous north and northeast, which has won every poll since 2001. \n",
      "Yingluck dissolved parliament on Dec. 9 to defuse massive street protests. However, calling a new election she is almost certain to win has had the opposite effect, sparking deadly clashes, mysterious shootings and concerns about military intervention or legal paralysis. \n",
      "The crisis has hurt Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy, which is already suffering from weak spending and sluggish export growth. \n",
      "The baht slid to 32.91 per dollar on Thursday, its weakest since February 2010. The share selloff came after foreign investors offloaded $1.26 billion of Thai shares in December, compared with $6.2 billion for the whole year. \n",
      "Thailand’s Election Commission (EC) met on Thursday to try to find a solution to break the poll deadlock but, with Thais deeply polarised, that appears increasingly unlikely. \n",
      "The conflict is all too familiar in Thailand after eight years of upheaval characterised by violent street protests and blockades, as well as judicial and military intervention. \n",
      "Yingluck has spent much of the past two weeks in her northern strongholds but returned to Bangkok on Wednesday to join military leaders in paying a New Year goodwill visit to  King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s top aide, Prem Tinsulanonda, a retired general in his 90s. \n",
      "Yingluck is clinging on, asserting her democratic mandate from an election landslide in 2011, but protesters backed by Bangkok’s royalist establishment, the opposition Democrat Party and old-money families are demanding she resigns to allow an appointed “people’s council” to take over. \n",
      "Thailand has been in a tense stalemate for weeks and the government is looking increasingly isolated. \n",
      "The mostly peaceful protests descended into chaos on Dec. 26  when a hard core of demonstrators tried to invade an election registration centre. Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, while unknown gunmen killed a policeman and a demonstrator. Scores were wounded. \n",
      "The EC urged Yingluck to postpone the election after those clashes but was quickly rebuffed by the government, which said any delay would be unconstitutional. \n",
      "The next day, the country’s powerful army chief refused to rule out intervening to defuse the crisis, a marked shift from the usual denials by a coup-prone military.   (Additional reporting by Akarapol Niyomyat; Writing by Martin Petty; Editing by Richard Borsuk and Paul Tait)\n",

      "UPDATE 3-Panama presses Spain and Italy to resolve canal cost row\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "* Panama Canal project may be suspended \n",
      "* Cost overruns represent half of original contract value \n",
      "* Sacyr shares fall 9 pct \n",
      "By Elida Moreno and Elisabeth O’Leary \n",
      "PANAMA CITY/MADRID, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The president of Panama said on Thursday he would go to Spain and Italy to pressure companies to honor contracts to expand his country’s canal after a building consortium behind the project threatened to suspend work because of a row over costs. \n",
      "The consortium - Spain’s Sacyr, Italy’s Salini Impregilo, Belgium’s Jan De Nul and Panama’s Constructora Urbana - said on Wednesday that $1.6 billion in cost overruns on the $3.2 billion plan to build a third set of locks for the canal should be met by Panama. \n",
      "The consortium, known as Grupo Unidos por el Canal, said the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) had 21 days to respond to its demands during which work would continue, but the project would be suspended if that requirement was not met. \n",
      "Just a few hours later, the PCA rejected the demand, hinting it could find others to complete the job. Shares in Sacyr, which heads the consortium, slumped 9 percent on Thursday. \n",
      "Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli accused the companies of “great irresponsibility” and said they had endangered the massive construction project, which has been a major driver of the Central American nation’s economy. \n",
      "Martinelli, who took power in 2009, said he expected Italy and Spain to uphold commitments to back the project which the countries’ leaders made to him during his first year in office. \n",
      "“So I’m going to go to Spain and Italy to demand this from them, because a company should not be able to put such a high amount of overrun costs on a project that belongs to humanity,” he told reporters in Panama City. \n",
      "The Spanish and Italian governments have a “moral responsibility” to help resolve the dispute because their companies were engaged in the construction, Martinelli said. \n",
      "Jorge Quijano, the head of the PCA, said if the project were delayed due to the dispute, Panama would see it through. \n",
      "“This work will be finished, never fear, even if it takes longer to complete,” he told reporters. \n",
      "Panama has already moved back the scheduled completion date for the expansion from October 2014 into mid-2015. \n",
      "To see that the work was concluded, Quijano said the PCA had since November been in contact with insurer Zurich in North America, with which it had $600 million in surety bonds that could be used to support the project. \n",
      "In addition, the PCA could tap the $1.2 billion it had not yet paid to the consortium to finish the work, he added. So far the PCA had only paid the contractors $2 billion, he said. \n",
      "The new locks represent the biggest chunk of the canal expansion plan, which overall is worth some $5.3 billion. \n",
      "The PCA says the total expansion is just over 70 percent finished with the locks 65 percent complete. The canal’s extension aims to broaden and deepen existing channels so that more and bigger vessels can sail through. \n",
      "The consortium said the overruns were due to unforeseen events during construction, which it said was “normal” in such projects. It also said the PCA had failed in its obligations and given the consortium “inexact” information for the project. \n",
      "But the PCA said that if the consortium was not capable of  honouring its agreements, it would initiate “mechanisms from the contract that would allow the work to be completed.” \n",
      "It did not explain what those would be. \n",
      "Sacyr won the bid on the canal contract in 2009 with a $3.12 billion offer, which was considerably lower than that of rivals, as well as below the $3.48 billion reference set by the PCA. \n",
      "Political columnist Pepe Oneto, writing in opinion blog republica.com, said the news was terrible for Spain’s attempt to rebuild its image abroad following a severe economic crisis  with the collapse of the country’s building and property sector. \n",
      "“The Spanish government ... knew that it was impossible for the budget to be met. Sacyr bid low, convinced that, in the end, the cost overruns it is demanding now would be met,” he said. \n",
      "A spokesman for Sacyr said that part of the cost overrun was because some building materials as originally budgeted were not adequate for the final work. The PCA had rejected the concrete mix the consortium had planned to use for the project. \n",
      "“The consortium’s intention is also to find a solution within the terms of the contract, as there are mechanisms that make it possible,” Sacyr’s spokesman said, without elaborating. \n",
      "The company’s debts at the end of September were three times its market capitalization. Analysts at the brokerage of Banco Sabadell said the news was not good for Sacyr or its image, but played down the impact on the builder’s results. \n",
      "Newspaper El Pais reported in 2009 that Panama’s foreign minister, Juan Carlos Varela, had predicted the project would fail because the builders were in financial trouble. \n",
      "Sacyr made 55 percent of its revenue outside Spain in the first nine months of 2013, and Panama contributed 25 percent of its 1.3 billion euros ($1.78 billion) in international sales, the company said in its 2013 nine month earnings.\n",

      "By Dasha Afanasieva \n",
      "ISTANBUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Turkish lira deepened its slide to record lows on Thursday as fears that consumption tax hikes would fuel inflation added to concern about the fallout of an unprecedented corruption scandal. \n",
      "In a surprise move, Turkey raised the special consumption taxes on new passenger cars, alcoholic drinks, tobacco products and mobile phones on Wednesday, which analysts estimated could add 1 percent to inflation this year. \n",
      "That adds to a growing list of headaches for a central bank already heavily involved in propping up the lira with sales of foreign currency reserves while striving to keep interest rates low to support growth. \n",
      "The lira weakened to a record of 2.1800 to the dollar by 1043 GMT from 2.1500 late on Tuesday, ahead of the New Year holiday. Higher inflation makes the currency less profitable to hold, assuming stable interest rates. \n",
      "Investors are also increasingly concerned by the lira’s fall, given that Turkey’s current account deficit - $52 billion in the first ten months of last year - dwarfs the roughly $40 billion analysts say the bank has in readily available reserves. \n",
      "“We believe that the noted tax hikes, which can be viewed as part of the authorities’ efforts to contain the wide current account deficit, will further complicate inflation dynamics,” Citigroup economist Ilker Domac said in a research note. \n",
      "“The combination of the CBT (central bank’s) limited net foreign international reserves, the country’s large external financing needs and locals’ inclination to hoard forex lead us to believe that ... the CBT will have no choice but to hike rates considerably.” \n",
      "Fearing a hit on economic growth ahead of the polls, the central bank has so far refused to increase its main interest rates, opting instead for an unorthodox mix of dollar sales and withholding one-week repo auctions. \n",
      "It sold a total of $1.2 billion in forex auctions on Monday and Tuesday to try to bolster the lira, but was due to go back to its more usual $100 million sales on Thursday and Friday. \n",
      "The wide-ranging graft probe, which began with a series of dawn raids and arrests last month and has led to the resignation of three ministers and dismissal of around 70 police officers, has shaken the political establishment and rattled investors. \n",
      "Foreign business interests in Turkey have been served well by the stable and economically liberal regime of Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, who has overseen a decade of strong development and growth. \n",
      "The corruption probe has highlighted fractures within his ruling party, increasing the risk of a change in political direction in a cycle of elections starting this year. \n",
      "“It’s the sheer amount of uncertainty (that is worrying markets),” said Lars Christensen, head of emerging markets research at Danske Bank. \n",
      "“The outcomes are pretty much open-ended for the first time. The collapse of the government is a risk or a weakened government under Erdogan. If this was 5 years ago market reaction would have been even stronger because the AKP was much more reformist.” \n",
      "Shortly after the graft scandal broke, the central bank said it would sell at least $6 billion before the end of January in support of the lira. \n",
      "The market will also be watching December inflation figures, due to be released by the statistics institute on Friday. \n",
      "Dragged down by car, cigarette and alcohol producers as well as retailers, the main stock index was down 1.9 percent at 66,835 points, underperforming the main emerging market index  which was down 0.92 percent. \n",
      "The yield on Turkey’s 10-year benchmark bond  rose to 10.47 percent from 10.41 percent on Tuesday.   (Editing by Nick Tattersall and Patrick Graham)\n",

      "Fisker seeks rejection of Chinese suitor it blames for its bankruptcy\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - Fisker Automotive, the bankrupt maker of a plug-in hybrid sports car, asked a federal judge to approve its proposed sale to a Hong Kong tycoon rather than a Chinese suitor that Fisker alleged was to blame for its failure. \n",
      "A courtroom showdown is set for January 10 that will determine the future of the defunct car maker, which was launched with a controversial U.S. government loan. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Kevin Gross must decide if Fisker’s business will be put to open auction or sold to an affiliate of Richard Li as the company has proposed. \n",
      "The hearing was originally scheduled for Friday, but was postponed one week as a major snowstorm threatened to disrupt travel throughout the eastern United States. \n",
      "The company’s plans were thrown into doubt on Monday, when the official creditors’ committee proposed auctioning the business and presented an initial $24.725 million bid from the U.S. unit of Wanxiang Group, China’s top auto parts company. \n",
      "Fisker attacked the creditors’ proposal in a series of court filings on Wednesday with the bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware, noting that after Wanxiang bought A123 Systems Inc, a battery maker, it cut supplies to Fisker. \n",
      "“Wanxiang now seeks to profit from a bankruptcy that it helped cause,” Fisker said in a filing. \n",
      "An attorney for the creditors’ committee disputed that, noting that Wanxiang acquired A123 months after Fisker idled its production to save cash. “Fisker was no longer producing cars at that time,” said Sunni Beville, of law firm Brown Rudnick. \n",
      "The creditors’ committee has called the Wanxiang bid proposal the best option. It also asked the bankruptcy court to allow it to sue to former Fisker director David Manion and others for improperly pushing the sale to Li. \n",
      "Hanging in the balance are the assets of a company once touted as America’s “green” rival to prestigious brands such as Maserati, but that has not made its signature Karma vehicle in more than a year. \n",
      "The company obtained a $529 million loan from the Department of Energy that was meant to promote fuel-efficient cars, which in turn helped to lure private backing. \n",
      "Fisker raised more than $1.4 billion in public and private funds after its founding in 2007. But lavish spending, quality and engineering blunders and other mistakes drained the company’s coffers and delayed the launch of the Karma, several people close to the company told Reuters earlier this year. \n",
      "An entity affiliated with Li planned to buy Fisker after he paid $25 million for Fisker’s government loan, outbidding Wanxiang. Instead of using cash, the Li affiliate planned to buy Fisker’s assets using a “credit bid” of a portion of what Fisker owed on that loan, leaving other creditors with next to nothing. \n",
      "Court records show that a majority of unsecured creditors such as design consultants and suppliers voted to reject the plan to sell Fisker to Li. \n",
      "The case is In re Fisker Automotive Holdings Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 13-13087. \n",

      "* Government points to EU fishing deal, oil exploration \n",
      "* Europe’s renewables hurting demand for potential north African imports \n",
      "By Aziz  El Yaakoubi \n",
      "RABAT, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A Moroccan solar project worth some $9 billion (6.6 billion euros) aimed at turning desert sun into lucrative power exports to Europe could be at risk as international lenders balk at plants planned for the disputed Western Sahara. \n",
      "Morocco drew up plans in 2009 to build solar plants and wind farms to generate 4 gigawatts of power by 2020 but much of that output is to come from sites planned in Western Sahara, the focus of a decades-old territorial dispute. \n",
      "Morocco has controlled most of Western Sahara since 1975 and claims the sparsely populated stretch of desert, which has offshore fishing, phosphate reserves and oilfield potential, as its own. \n",
      "However, the Algeria-backed Polisario Front seeks independence and a United Nations mission was formed more than 20 years ago ahead of an expected referendum on Western Sahara’s political future which has never taken place. \n",
      "The dispute was rekindled in October when Morocco recalled its ambassador from Algeria after that country’s president upset Rabat by calling for human rights monitors to be sent to the region. \n",
      "Western Sahara has also drawn scrutiny as European and U.S. authorities worry that damaged relations between Morocco and Algeria could hurt cooperation against Islamist militants who are active across the Maghreb. \n",
      "Morocco’s plans call for building five solar power plants, including two in Western Sahara - a 500 megawatt (MW) plant at Foum El Oued and a 100 MW plant near Boujdour. Another 500 MW project is planned at Sabkhat Tah which borders Western Sahara. \n",
      "Yet lending sources at German state-owned bank KFW, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the European Union have told Reuters they will not finance projects based in Western Sahara. \n",
      "“If we support those investments, it would look like we are supporting the Moroccan position. We are neutral regarding that conflict,” one senior bank source said. \n",
      "A second source said: “We have never supported any project in that territory (Western Sahara), and we won’t, although the Moroccan solar plan means a lot for us.” \n",
      "All the sources declined to be named because of the political sensitivity of the matter. \n",
      "Progress on the solar projects has so far been limited to one site within Morocco where Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power IPO-ACPO.SE is building a 160 MW solar plant in the city of Ouarzazate. \n",
      "MASEN, Morocco’s solar energy agency, plans to launch tenders soon for construction of two more plants worth 1.7 billion euros - one of 100 MW and another of 200 MW - also near Ouarzazate. \n",
      "Germany’s KFW backed a 654-million-euro loan in October to part-finance these. \n",
      "Mines and Energy Minister Abdelkader Amara said Morocco dismissed concerns over financing though he acknowledged plans for Western Sahara were not yet finalised. \n",
      "“In the initial plan, three solar power plants of five are based in the southern provinces (Western Sahara), but we have not yet decided all those areas yet,” he said. \n",
      "“If those institutions say that they would not finance them, we will see at the time.” \n",
      "Sources say Morocco may seek alternative bilateral financing from Arab Gulf states already invested in the kingdom if KFW and others balk at backing the sites planned for Western Sahara. \n",
      "But they say these investors may also be skittish over such investment and would be unlikely to finance the whole of it. \n",
      "While rights groups such as Amnesty International accuse Morocco of continuing to use excessive force against activists and repressing political freedom in Western Sahara, Rabat invests heavily there hoping to calm social unrest and independence claims. \n",
      "Yet any investment involving international firms stirs protests over the legitimacy of Moroccans to negotiate on behalf of the Western Saharan population. \n",
      "EU lawmakers approved a fisheries agreement with Morocco last month, allowing European ships into Moroccan and Western Saharan waters, two years after rejecting a similar deal out of concern it might strengthen Rabat’s control over Western Sahara. \n",
      "Morocco’s official media portrayed the EU fishing deal as a political victory while the Polisario Front dubbed it a violation of international law. \n",
      "Kosmos Energy and Cairn Energy last year also started seismic surveys off Cap Boujdour in Western Sahara and plan to drill an exploration petroleum well. \n",
      "“We respect international laws. We have started oil exploration and have signed a fishing agreement with the European Union,” Amara said. \n",
      "“So I don’t see why we could not get the financing needed for those solar power projects.” \n",
      "Moroccan lawmakers drew up a renewable energy law in 2009 which helped attract foreign investors including German industrial and financial firms which set up the north Africa-focussed Desertec Industrial Initiative (DII). \n",
      "However, some members have since quit the DII, including manufacturers Siemens and Bosch, and European efforts to bolster production of renewable energy have reduced Europe’s need for potential North African imports. \n",
      "Morocco has domestic demand for such power, however, as the country remains heavily reliant on energy imports.   (Editing by Patrick Markey and Jason Neely)\n",

      "FireEye buys cyber forensics firm Mandiant for about $1 billion\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "BOSTON (Reuters) - Cybersecurity company FireEye Inc has acquired Mandiant Corp, the computer forensics specialist best known for unveiling a secretive Chinese military unit believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks on U.S. companies. \n",
      "FirEye shares jumped more than 20 percent after Thursday’s announcement of the $1.05 billion cash-and-stock deal, which FireEye said closed on Monday. It unites two companies with relatively new technologies for thwarting cyber attacks, and brings together two of the most-respected executives in the security industry: FireEye CEO Dave DeWalt and Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia. \n",
      "While sales of older anti-virus products have been on the decline, security experts expect strong growth in both FireEye’s cloud-based systems for detecting malicious software and Mandiant’s software that analyzes cyber attacks. \n",
      "About a year ago the two companies entered into a technology development agreement that made it easier to deploy their products together. With the merger, FireEye will gain Mandiant’s team of forensics investigators. \n",
      "“They have these very strong Navy ‘cyber’ Seals who respond to breaches and are very good at what they do,” DeWalt said about Mandiant. He had previously served as chairman of Mandiant’s board. \n",
      "“My aim is to create the strongest security company in the world,” DeWalt said in an interview. \n",
      "FireEye, which has yet to post a profit, said the acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings and expects the combined company’s revenue to grow about 50 percent this year. In comparison, Symantec Corp, the biggest maker of anti-virus software, has said it expects fiscal 2014 revenue to drop 3 percent to 4 percent. \n",
      "Mandiant is best known for its forensics services. The company rose to prominence in February 2013 when it published a report detailing what it said were links between a Shanghai-based unit of the People’s Liberation Army and a long list of attacks on U.S. companies. Beijing denied all allegations in the report. \n",
      "“If you combine FireEye’s advanced persistent threat technology with Mandiant’s endpoint protection, it really makes them a major force in the cyber-security industry,” said FBR analyst Daniel Ives. \n",
      "Mandiant, which has long been profitable, generates sales of more than $100 million a year, according to DeWalt. \n",
      "Also on Thursday, FireEye announced preliminary revenue for the fourth quarter above its previous estimate. It said fourth-quarter revenue would be between $55 million and $57 million, compared to its previous estimate of between $52 million to $54 million. \n",
      "DeWalt has declined to say when he expects the company to be profitable. \n",
      "FireEye, which has a market capitalization of around $5 billion, will pay for Mandiant with a combination of stock and cash. It issued 21.5 million shares and options, which were worth $939 million on Monday, when the stock closed at $43.69. \n",
      "A company spokesman said it had about 140 million shares outstanding after the deal was completed. \n",
      "It will also pay $106.5 million in net cash to Mandiant’s shareholders, who include Mandia as well as Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and One Equity Partners, the private investment arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co. \n",
      "Brenon Daly, M&A; research director for 451 Group, said that FireEye was paying approximately 10 times Mandiant’s annual revenue. That is about the same revenue multiple that Cisco Systems Inc paid in its $2.7 purchase of Sourcefire Inc, last year’s biggest deal in the information security industry, he said. \n",
      "“This is one of the first time we have seen one of the new high-flying IPOs use the currency generated through the IPO process to pull of this large a transaction,” Daly said. \n",
      "DeWalt said he owns some shares in Mandiant and will disclose the size of his stake within a few days through a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n",
      "FireEye shares rose 23.51 percent in extended trade after closing down 5.69 percent at $41.13 on Nasdaq. \n",
      "FireEye’s rivals include Palo Alto Networks Inc, which went public in 2012 in one of that year’s most successful IPOs. \n",
      "Mandiant was founded in 2004 by Kevin Mandia, a former U.S. Air Force cyber-forensics investigator who co-authored an influential textbook on the subject. The company made its name by automating processes used to investigate computer breaches. \n",
      "The company was largely unknown outside the computer security world until February of last year, when it fingered the People’s Liberation Army’s Shanghai-based Unit 61398 as the most likely driving force behind a Chinese hacking group known as \n",
      "Other security companies had published reports on cyberattacks, but had shied away from so clearly identifying their perpetrators. \n",
      "DeWalt said FireEye would consider releasing similar reports now that it owns Mandiant. \n",
      "“You will probably see us continue to do it when it is appropriate,” he said. “There is some incredibly egregious behavior.” \n",
      "DeWalt is the former chief executive of anti-virus software maker McAfee who sold McAfee to Intel Corp. \n",
      "Mandia was named FireEye’s chief operating officer. He said in an interview that he plans to move to Silicon Valley, where FireEye has its headquarters, from the Washington D.C. area. \n",
      "“I’m in this for the long-term,” he said. “This is as exciting as heck for me.” \n",

      "© 2018 Reuters. All Rights Reserved.Human foot found on south Florida beach\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Investigators in south Florida are trying to identify a human foot inside a tube sock and midsize white New Balance athletic shoe found by a beach walker on New Year’s Day. \n",
      "An autopsy on Thursday concluded that the foot likely separated naturally from a decomposing body in the water, either by the force of waves or because of a large fish shaking the body, Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told Reuters. \n",
      "“There is no evidence of man-made trauma. No cutting or sawing on it,” Snyder said. “It was a clean dislocation. It just came apart.” \n",
      "The autopsy indicated the body part had been in the water for a period of a few days to 10 days, but could not determine the sex, race or cause of death, Snyder said. \n",
      "The foot was discovered shortly after noon on Wednesday under sea grass at Peck Lake Beach at the north end of Jupiter Island, north of Palm Beach. After a ground and helicopter search over several miles, investigators found a matching shoe but no other human remains. \n",
      "The shoes were all white except for the New Balance logo, estimated to be size 7-9 and described by Snyder as a running or cross-trainer style. Snyder said his gut reaction is that the victim was male. \n",
      "“It’s a kind of shoe I would buy and I wouldn’t buy anything that looked like a woman’s shoe,” said Snyder, acknowledging that it is “not a scientific answer.” \n",
      "DNA analysis is under way, he said, and it could help identify the remains. But one potential claimant was ruled out quickly: A man who reported that his own foot had been cut off several days earlier by a boat propeller in Palm Beach County. Snyder said that man’s footwear and the found shoes were not a match. \n",
      "Snyder said his agency is considering the possibility that the foot may have belonged to a Juno Beach boater or a woman from Sebastian who disappeared recently in separate incidents. \n",
      "Investigators also raised the possibility of the victim being a refugee who failed to make it to shore, or even a homicide victim kept in a freezer for any length of time. \n",
      "Snyder said he couldn’t recall another time when a body part washed up on Martin County beaches. \n",
      "“It’s pretty uncommon for us. But we’re a coastal state. So I don’t know that it’s that uncommon from Key West up to Jacksonville,” Snyder said. \n",

      "5 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on their first day of trading in 2014 as investors booked profits in the wake of the S&P; 500’s best yearly advance since 1997, with many of last year’s strongest performers down on the day. \n",
      "All 10 S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with tech among the biggest drags after Wells Fargo downgraded Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to “market perform” from “outperform,” saying the company’s market cap had limited upside potential without material market share gains. \n",
      "Apple fell 1.4 percent to $553.13 and was the biggest drag on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 .NDX indexes. The S&P; technology index .SPLRCT fell 1.1 percent. \n",
      "Adding to the weakness in the group were stocks that had enjoyed the best gains in 2013, including Netflix (NFLX.O), which was down 1.5 percent at $362.82, and Micron Tech Inc (MU.O), which was off 0.4 percent at $21.66. Both names more than tripled last year. \n",
      "“There’s no fundamental underpinning to the decline today, just basic portfolio rebalancing on the first day of a new tax year,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Global Investments. “People are taking profits and seeking bargains.” \n",
      "Almost two-thirds of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed lower while 61 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares closed down. \n",
      "Newmont Mining (NEM.N) was one of the biggest gainers of the day, up 4 percent to $23.96; the stock was the weakest S&P; component of 2013. \n",
      "Gold prices rose 1.5 percent following a 28 percent slump over 2013, a drop that broke a 12-year advance for the precious metal and was its worst yearly performance since 1981. \n",
      "The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 135.31 points, or 0.82 percent, at 16,441.35. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was down 16.38 points, or 0.89 percent, at 1,831.98. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 33.52 points, or 0.80 percent, at 4,143.07. \n",
      "The S&P; closed 2013 with a 29.6 percent gain for the year, its best annual performance since 1997. The Dow surged 26.5 percent in its best year since 1995. The Nasdaq jumped 38.3 percent, its best year since 2009. \n",
      "In the latest economic data, weekly initial claims slipped for a second straight week while financial data firm Markit said its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose in December. Separately, an index of U.S. factory activity stood at 57.0 last month, in line with forecasts but below November’s reading. \n",
      "“The data indicates that the economy has momentum in 2014, but the odds are low that we’ll see gains of the magnitude we saw last year,” said McDonald, who helps oversee more than $800 billion. “Valuations were the big driver last year, but now that those are richer we need earnings to pick up the mantle.” \n",
      "In a note to clients, Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup, boosted his year-end 2014 target for the S&P; 500 to 1,975 from 1,900, citing earnings progress as the primary driver. \n",
      "On the upside, U.S. Steel Corp (X.N) rose 2.6 percent to $30.28 after KeyBanc upgraded the stock to “buy,” while Urban Outfitters (URBN.O) rose 1.8 percent to $37.78 on an upgrade from Jefferies. \n",
      "In other markets, crude oil dropped 3 percent to $95.50 per barrel as Libya prepared to restart a major oilfield and on speculation of a sharp rise in crude stockpiles in Cushing, Oklahoma. \n",
      "Separately, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a safety warning that the type of crude oil produced in the Bakken region in the northern United States could be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil, pressuring companies that produce oil in the region. \n",
      "Among the most active names, Oasis Petroleum (OAS.N) fell 4.1 percent to $45.05 and Continental Resources (CLR.N) lost 4.2 percent to $107.76. \n",

      "By Alistair Smout \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - European shares touched fresh 5-1/2 year highs on Thursday before slipping back, hit by weakness in utilities and miners after a strong end to 2013 left the region’s equities in overbought territory. \n",
      "Fiat lent some support to the market though, surging 12.5 percent after the Italian carmaker gained full control of Chrysler. \n",
      "Utilities were the worst-performing sector, down 0.8 percent and pegged back by a 2 percent fall in RWE  after a media report sparked concern that Germany’s No. 2 utility may be considering a capital increase. \n",
      "News that China’s factory activity slowed in December dented the basic resources sector, down 0.7 percent, as the data raised concern about the strength of demand in the world’s second-largest economy and biggest metals consumer. \n",
      "The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.5 percent at 1,309.89 at 1041 GMT. It has gained more than 6 percent since the middle of December. \n",
      "The relative strength index (RSI) was above 70 before the index pared gains, indicating that it was in “overbought” territory and due some consolidation. \n",
      "The FTSEurofirst rallied 16.1 percent in 2013 in its best showing since 2009 thanks to ample liquidity from global central banks and early signs of an economic recovery in Europe. \n",
      "“It was a cracking end of the year for European stocks, and I expect a continuation of the same,” said Robert Quinn, chief European equity strategist at Standard & Poor’s. \n",
      "“Some argue that what happens on the first day of the year can reflect what happens for the rest of the year - that’s too simplistic for me,” he said. \n",
      "“We’re only down a fraction of a percent, and because we’ve had such a strong run up, I don’t see any cause for concern.” \n",
      "Fiat shares traded in heavy volume of 3.3 times their 90-day average after the company tied up a deal to buy the remaining 41.46 percent of American carmaker Chrysler that it did not already own, after over a year of protracted talks. \n",
      "Italian investment firm Exor, Fiat’s majority stakeholder, rose 4.6 percent, and the two stocks were the  FTSEurofirst 300’s top two gainers. \n",
      "Analysts at Citi said that the resolution of uncertainty over the tie-up, the slightly lower price than some had expected and Fiat’s statement that it didn’t envision the need to raise capital through a rights issue to finance the deal were all supportive factors for Fiat’s share price. \n",
      "Overall market volumes were light, at 25 percent of an already low 90-day average, and traders said that the seasonal fund flows that often fuel gains in January might not pick up until next week, as this week was interrupted by New Year holidays. \n",
      "“People are still in holiday mode, and it might not be before next week that we see volume come back to the market,” David Madden, analyst at IG, said. \n",

      "Lei Jun, who is also co-founder of the tech firm, made the projection on Sina Weibo, China’s most widely used microblogging site, and it was reposted on Xiaomi’s website. \n",
      "“We again promise, we will at least supply 40 million phones in 2014!” he wrote. China is the world’s biggest market for smartphones. \n",

      "BOSTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Activist investor and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb beat most rivals hands down last year as his flagship fund kept pace with a rallying U.S. stock market and returned 25.2 percent in 2013. \n",
      "Loeb’s $14 billion firm, Third Point, has been one of the industry’s best performers for several years now thanks to bets on Greek bonds, Japan’s economic recovery and blue-chip U.S. stocks. \n",
      "He told investors late on Thursday that his Third Point Offshore fund gained 2.3 percent in December, according to a client who received the performance update. \n",
      "His smaller Third Point Ultra fund, which uses borrowed money to boost returns, fared even better, gaining 3.4 percent last month to end the year up 37.9 percent, the client said. \n",
      "The figures were above the 6.5 percent global average return of hedge funds in 2013 and were in line with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index which climbed 29.6 percent, the index’s strongest annual return since 1997. \n",
      "Loeb, who most helped install Marissa Mayer as CEO at Yahoo  and is currently trying to overhaul auction house Sotheby’s, did not specify the investments that powered  his strong returns. \n",
      "While Loeb often employs a go-anywhere trading strategy, last year the bulk of his bets were on large U.S. stocks in the last month, he told clients. \n",
      "Loeb is expected to give more details on his portfolio when he releases his fourth quarter letter to investors in the next few weeks. \n",
      "At the end of the third quarter, Loeb’s three largest positions included Yahoo, American International Group  and Sotheby’s. He was also invested in FedEx Corp and said in November that he had taken a stake in Japan’s Softbank Corp. \n",
      "For Third Point, 2013 marks an even better year than 2012 when the fund gained 21.1 percent and the Third Point Ultra fund rose 33.5 percent. \n",
      "Since launching the flagship fund in 1996, Loeb has delivered average annual returns of 21.3 percent. During that time the broader stock market has gained 9 percent. \n",
      "Loeb has recently turned away clients and is now even returning some capital to existing investors, saying his fund should not grow much beyond $14 billion because it would be tough to invest the additional money. \n",
      "While Third Point rose by double digits, many other hedge funds struggled last year, failing to fully participate in the U.S. stock market’s rally.\n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - A lawyer who blew JK Rowling’s cover when she wrote a detective novel under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith has been fined 1,000 pounds ($1,650) and received a written warning from a British legal watchdog. \n",
      "Chris Gossage, a partner at Russells Solicitors, which represented the Harry Potter author, leaked one of the publishing world’s biggest secrets to his wife’s best friend - who then tweeted Galbraith’s real identity to a journalist. \n",
      "Rowling, Britain’s best-selling author, was furious when she found out that a partner at her London-based law firm had revealed she was the author of “The Cuckoo’s Calling”. \n",
      "Publicity material for the book had described it as the debut novel of retired military policeman Galbraith. \n",
      "After taking legal action against Gossage and his friend Judith Callegari, Rowling accepted an apology from the law firm which paid her legal costs and made a substantial, undisclosed donation to a charity of her choice, the Soldiers’ Charity. \n",
      "The Solicitors Regulation Authority said in a ruling released this week that Gossage had also received a written rebuke and was ordered to pay a 1,000 pound fine for disclosing confidential information about a client to a third party. \n",
      "No one from Russells Solicitors was immediately available to comment. Gossage was still listed as a partner at the firm that made it clear that unmasking Rowling was an error and not a marketing stunt. \n",
      "At the time, Rowling, 48, said it had been “wonderful” to publish without hype or expectation and to get feedback under a different name even if that meant some publishers rejected her work as they had when she first touted her Harry Potter books. \n",
      "The novel was released last April to strong reviews but minimal sales. Once her involvement was known, sales rocketed, sending the novel to the top of best-seller lists. \n",
      "“I feel very angry that my trust turned out to be misplaced,” Rowling said in a statement in July. “To say that I am disappointed is an understatement.” \n",
      "The novel, about a war veteran turned private eye investigating the death of a model, was published by Little, Brown, which in 2012 published Rowling’s first adult novel “The Casual Vacancy”. \n",

      "5 Min Read\n",
      "* Record bond sales by emerging market firms despite defaults \n",
      "* Study highlights currency mismatch risks \n",
      "* Fund managers see negligible risk of default rush soon \n",
      "By Sujata Rao \n",
      "LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - When Brazilian oil firm OGX tried to tap bond markets for $2 billion in 2011, investors were ready to hand it $5.5 billion. Two years on, OGX is in default and the debt trades at less than 10 cents of its original face value. \n",
      "The spectre of such defaults spreading across emerging markets has not yet dimmed investor enthusiasm for the corporate debt sector, which saw record-high bond sales of $330 billion-plus in 2013 and more than 150 first-time borrowers. \n",
      "Banks predict similar issuance for 2014, although the default of OGX and others - from Mexican homebuilders to Kazakh banks - are raising fears fund managers in the $1.4 trillion sector may end up with huge losses. \n",
      "Default rates are so far only creeping up, with a rate of 3.1 percent this year after 2.7 percent last year and 1.6 percent in 2010, JPMorgan data shows, but concerns over explosive growth and a sometimes blind dash for yield are growing. \n",
      "Dollar borrowing by companies has swelled tenfold since 2001, drawing in Chilean car dealers, Nigerian banks and Ukrainian poultry farmers. \n",
      "The 8.5 percent coupon paid by OGX persuaded buyers to overlook the fact it was yet to generate any revenues and did not offer the collateral against default that is common practice for a first-time issuer. \n",
      "Investors are so far unfazed, with 65 funds launched in 2012 and 2013, specifically to invest in emerging corporate debt, according to data from Thomson Reuters company Lipper. \n",
      "All this amounts to what Princeton University academic Hyun Song Shin terms “the second phase of global liquidity”, one where asset managers, rather than banks, have been the main players since 2010. \n",
      "“When the current lull in global financial conditions is eventually broken by tighter dollar funding conditions due to U.S. Federal Reserve monetary tightening, the vulnerabilities (of emerging companies) are likely to be exposed once more,” Shin said in a recent paper. \n",
      "At the heart of this thesis is the issue of currency mismatch - where revenues or assets are in local currencies but  debt is increasingly in dollars, a contradiction that may become more stark in future if the dollar strengthens. \n",
      "Shin says the magnitude of the mismatch is underestimated because a large portion of the bonds are issued by U.S. or U.K.-based subsidiaries of emerging markets firms, but capital set aside by the parent firms to protect against default is usually in emerging currencies such as roubles or pesos. \n",
      "So any wholesale deposit withdrawals by companies that run into trouble with their debt could in turn cause banking crises in the developing world. \n",
      "Shamaila Khan, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, says default rates will creep higher, but not explode. “You will see some of the repercussions of indiscriminate funding because of all the inflows the sector has received.” \n",
      "Khan estimates default rates of 3.0-3.5 percent in 2013 and 2014. While that is far off the 10 percent rate seen in 2009 or the 30 percent rate of the late 1990s, it has risen off a 2011 trough of 0.6 percent. \n",
      "Meanwhile not much corporate debt is due to be repaid in the near term, keeping the pressure off companies. \n",
      "Rob Stewart, a client portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, reckons the peak of debt maturities will fall in a decade or so from now, as bonds issued during the current boom come up for redemption. \n",
      "“The market is highly diversified, with a large number of countries, sectors and companies, so risks to asset managers from a default in one company or region are not high,” he said. \n",
      "It is also far too early to worry about a systemic crisis rooted in currency mismatch, says David Spegel, head of emerging debt strategy at ING Bank in New York. \n",
      "He notes firstly that two-thirds of outstanding debt comes from energy and metals companies that have natural hedges in place in the form of hard currency revenues. Others, notably banks, often hedge bond payments via swaps during issuance. \n",
      "Third, debt issued by external subsidiaries of emerging companies amounts to around $670 billion, Spegel calculates. But this comprises just 3 percent of the $19.5 trillion that is in bank deposits in the highest-risk countries, he says. \n",
      "“In most cases, EM bank deposits are high enough to curb the suggested threat for the financial system,” Spegel said. \n",
      "And prices compensate for risks, many argue. Bill Perry, head of the corporate investment team at Stone Harbor Investments, notes the substantial yield premia that high-yield company debt offers, to U.S. Treasuries as well as junk-rated U.S. credit. \n",
      "“You are getting a 200 bps in pick up when you pick EM high-yield over (developed market) high yield. You get paid a pickup and you get a comparable default rate,” Perry said. \n",
      "“Often when you buy high-yield names from emerging markets, you are buying very solid companies, they just come from the wrong zip code.”\n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "The Ottawa Senators enter the new year five points out of a playoff spot and need to improve on their 10-10-4 home record starting Thursday, when they host the Winnipeg Jets. Ottawa ended 2013 with wins in each of its last three home games as Craig Anderson’s play continues to improve. The netminder has allowed four goals over his last three starts and posted a .921 save percentage in December. \n",
      "Winnipeg is riding a three-game winning streak on the strength of backup goaltender Al Montoya, who is expected to make his third straight start Thursday. Montoya was called upon after Ondrej Pavelec allowed three goals in the opening 7:04 against Minnesota last Friday and has not looked back, stopping 82 of the 84 shots he has faced. The Jets are a mediocre 9-10-1 on the road but 11-4-1 against Eastern Conference opponents. \n",
      "TV: 7:30 p.m. ET, TSN (Winnipeg), RSN East (Ottawa) \n",
      "ABOUT THE JETS (19-18-5): Blake Wheeler, who scored 10 goals in December and leads the team with 15, was rewarded for his strong play by being named to the 2014 United States Olympic Team. Winnipeg is just 6-for-60 on the power play away from home and 0-for-7 during its winning streak. Rookie defenseman Jacob Trouba has points in each of his last three games and finished December with two goals and seven assists. \n",
      "ABOUT THE SENATORS (17-18-7): Coach Paul MacLean thinks Chris Neil will miss weeks rather than days due to an apparent leg injury. Neil was hurt Monday against Washington and joins Jason Spezza (hip) on the sidelines as the captain will miss his third straight game Thursday. Defenseman Chris Phillips is expected to return to the lineup after missing two contests with a foot injury. \n",
      "1. Wheeler has been one of Winnipeg’s top scorers over the last three seasons, amassing 136 points in 170 games. \n",
      "2. Senators F Bobby Ryan, who has 18 goals and 36 points, was not named to the U.S. Olympic Team. The 26-year-old New Jersey native scored five goals and added two assists in eight games as a member of the 2010 squad that captured a silver medal. \n",
      "3. Ottawa is 5-2-0 against the Jets since the franchise moved from Atlanta to Winnipeg. The Jets have been held to one goal in each of the last three meetings. \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "BERLIN (Reuters) - Rising output and strong growth in new orders helped German manufacturing expand at the fastest rate in 2-1/2 years in December, a survey showed on Thursday, pointing to a solid start to 2014 for Europe’s biggest economy. \n",
      "Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index for the German manufacturing sector, which accounts for about one-fifth of the economy, rose to 54.3 in December from 52.7 in November, its sixth consecutive month of expansion. \n",
      "The final reading was the highest since June 2011, and was a tick above the preliminary figure of 54.2 and well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, helped also by a boost in employment in the sector. \n",
      "“The survey suggests the German manufacturing sector has gained momentum through the winter, said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. \n",
      "“Improving global economic conditions have helped to boost new orders and generate renewed job creation across the sector. Manufacturers of investment goods were the main beneficiaries of the brightening export climate at the end of 2013.” \n",
      "The German economy, a bastion of growth in the early years of the euro zone crisis, slowed last year and had a subdued start to 2013. It bounced back in the second quarter and growth was solid although slower in the third. Economists expect a similar performance between October and December. \n",
      "“There are positive signals in terms of the growth outlook for 2014, as a build-up of unfinished workloads during December and the desire to reverse recent declines in inventories should support output volumes over the months ahead,” Moore added. \n",
      "Recent sentiment surveys have shown business, investor and consumer morale brightening, but backward-looking hard data has generally been more muted, with the latest industrial figures showing orders and output fell in October. \n",

      "LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists seeking a cure for AIDS say they have been inspired, not crushed, by a major setback in which two HIV positive patients believed to have been cured found the virus re-invading their bodies once more. \n",
      "True, the news hit hard last month that the so-called “Boston patients” - two men who received bone marrow transplants that appeared to rid them completely of the AIDS-causing virus - had relapsed and gone back onto antiretroviral treatment. \n",
      "But experts say the disappointment could lay the basis for important leaps forward in the search for a cure. \n",
      "“It’s a setback for the patients, of course, but an advance for the field because the field has now gained a lot more knowledge,” said Steven Deeks, a professor and HIV expert at the University of California, San Francisco. \n",
      "He and other experts say the primary practical message is that current tests designed to detect even very low levels of HIV present in the body are simply not sensitive enough. \n",
      "As well as having the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the Boston patients both also had a type of blood cancer called lymphoma, for which they were treated using bone marrow transplants - one man in 2008 and the other in 2010. \n",
      "They continued taking the antiretroviral AIDS drugs, but eight months after each patient’s transplant, doctors found they could not detect any sign of HIV in their blood. \n",
      "In the early part of 2013, both patients decided to stop taking their AIDS drugs and both appeared to remain HIV-free - prompting their doctors, Timothy Henrich and Daniel Kuritzkes from Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, to announce at a conference in July that they may have been cured. \n",
      "Yet in December came news that one of the men had begun to show signs of an HIV rebound by August, while the second patient had a relapse in November. \n",
      "Henrich said the virus’ comeback underlined how ingenious HIV can be in finding hiding places in the body to evade attack efforts by the immune system and by drug treatment. \n",
      "“Through this research we have discovered the HIV reservoir is deeper and more persistent than previously known and that our current standards of probing for HIV may not be sufficient,” he said, adding that both patients were “currently in good health” and back on antiretroviral therapy. \n",
      "Barely a decade ago, few HIV scientists would have dared put the words HIV and cure in the same sentence. Yet some intriguing and inspiring cases in recent years mean many now believe it is just a question of time before a cure is found. \n",
      "First was the now famous case of Timothy Ray Brown, the so-called “Berlin patient,” whose HIV was eradicated by a complex treatment for leukemia in 2007 involving the destruction of his immune system and a stem cell transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection. \n",
      "Such an elaborate, expensive and life-threatening procedure could never be used as a broad-spectrum approach for the world’s 34 million HIV patients. But the results in Brown focused scientific attention on a genetic mutation known as ‘CCR5 delta 32’ as a target for possible gene therapy treatment. \n",
      "Then last March, French scientists who followed 14 HIV-positive people known as the “Visconti patients”, who were treated very swiftly with HIV drugs but then stopped treatment, said that even after seven years off therapy, they were still showing no signs of the virus rebounding. \n",
      "That announcement came only weeks after news of the “functional cure” of an HIV-positive baby in Mississippi who received antiretroviral treatment for 18 months from the day she was born. By the time she was two this appeared to have stopped the virus replicating and spreading. \n",
      "A “functional cure” is when HIV is reduced to such low levels that it is kept at bay even without treatment, though the virus can still be detected in the body. \n",
      "Sharon Lewin, an HIV expert at Monash University in Australia, said all these developments, as well as the setback suffered by the Boston patients, inspired scientists to investigate many different approaches in the search for a cure. \n",
      "“We’ve learnt many things here - and one of the most important is that a tiny, tiny amount of virus can get the whole thing going again,” she told Reuters. “It’s a clear message that we need better ways to pick up the virus.” \n",
      "Scientists are now more convinced than ever that a two-pronged approach which aims to firmly suppress the virus while bolstering the immune system provides the best way forward. \n",
      "“We need to attack in two ways - reduce the virus to very low levels and also to boost the immune response. We can’t do one without the other,” said Lewin. \n",
      "“So we still have to think of other creative ways to control HIV. And it’s still early days... before we can say which approach is likely to be the winner.” \n",

      "China December services PMI falls to four-month low\n",
      "\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China’s services sector fell to a four-month low in December as business expectations dropped, a government survey showed, adding to evidence that the world’s second-largest economy lost steam into the close of 2013. \n",
      "The official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the non-manufacturing sector dropped to 54.6 in December from November’s 56, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday. \n",
      "While the services PMI held above the 50 level that indicates expansion, slackening growth mirrors a fourth-quarter cooldown in factory activity and the broader economy as credit supply moderated and firms rebuilt inventories more slowly. \n",
      "Ting Lu, an economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, said another factor was the fading effect of China’s “mini” economic stimulus rolled out in mid-2013 to prop up slowing activity. \n",
      "“There was pent-up demand in the third quarter and we don’t expect it to be sustained in the fourth quarter,” he said, adding he expected quarterly growth to ease to 2 percent in the December quarter, from 2.2 percent in the previous three months. \n",
      "The services PMI follows two manufacturing PMIs out this week that showed growth in China’s factories slowing in December as export orders weakened. \n",
      "Friday’s survey showed a sub-index for business expectations sagged to 58.7 last month from November’s 61.3, dragged down by the property and water transportation sectors where firms expected activity to contract. \n",
      "New orders held steady at 51, though the poll showed price pressures were building. A sub-index for intermediate prices climbed to 56.9 in December from November’s 54.8, while prices charged rose to 52 from 49.5. \n",
      "Rising prices are in line with a widely held view among economists that inflation will grind higher in coming years, as a depleting supply of low-cost labor pushes up wage and production costs. \n",
      "A Reuters poll in October found economic growth was expected to be 7.6 percent in 2013, a shade higher than the government’s 7.5 percent target but still the weakest rate in 14 years. \n",
      "A separate PMI survey of the services industry by Markit Economics and HSBC will be released on Jan 6. That survey covers more smaller, private firms than the official PMI. \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "JAKARTA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s output of liquefied natural gas is expected to rise nearly 6 percent in 2014, although exports by the world’s No.5 exporter of the super-cooled fuel will hold steady, its energy regulator said on Thursday. \n",
      "Indonesia consumes around 40 billion cubic feet of gas and demand is rising by around 10 percent a year. This could climb further as the government moves away from costly oil imports to reduce its current account deficit. \n",
      "Indonesian LNG, produced by companies including Total , Exxon Mobil, and BP, is shipped to Japan, Korea, the United States and China. \n",
      "LNG production was expected at approximately 306 cargoes (just over 17 million tonnes) or 2,735 million standard cubic feet a day (mmscfd) this year, said Arief Riyanto, chief of the commercial gas division at regulator SKKMigas, up from an estimated output of 289 cargoes in 2013. \n",
      "Of that total, Indonesia will export 268 cargoes, unchanged from the previous year, Riyanto said. In November, it had targetted to produce 314 LNG cargoes in 2013, of which 285 were to be shipped out. \n",
      "This year, LNG production from BP’s Tangguh LNG project in Papua is expected to reach 116 cargoes, while Pertamina  is expected to produce 177 cargoes at its Bontang LNG refinery, and 13 cargoes at Arun. \n",
      "Indonesia signed its first LNG import deal in December, signaling the beginning of a sea change for a country that has been a key exporter of the fuel for decades. \n",
      "Supplies of LNG globally have tightened in recent years due to increased demand from energy-hungry Asian economies as well as nuclear reactor shutdowns in the world’s largest consumers of the fuel - Japan and South Korea. \n",

      "* Libya hopes to restart El Sharara oilfield in days \n",
      "* China factory activity slows in December - government, HSBC \n",
      "* Traders expect a build at Cushing - market sources \n",
      "* Coming up: EIA oil inventory data on Friday   (Recasts top paragraphs, updates to settlement prices) \n",
      "By Jeanine Prezioso \n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices collapsed on the first trading day of 2014 as Libya prepared to restart a major oilfield, and with speculation of a sharp rise in crude stockpiles in Cushing, Oklahoma. \n",
      "Prices were also undermined by expectations of a further dip in fuel demand as a winter storm bore down on the northeastern United States. \n",
      "A decrease in U.S. jobless claims and increase in manufacturing activity strengthened the U.S. dollar on forecasts the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to slow its stimulus program, pressuring oil prices. A weakening stock market further added to losses. \n",
      "U.S. crude oil finished with the largest daily percent loss in more than a year, after ending last year with a more than 7 percent gain. After finishing unchanged from where they started in 2013, Brent futures ended the first trading day of the new year with the biggest percent decline in six months. \n",
      "“Really what’s moving the market back down is Libya back online,” said Bill Baruch, senior market strategist at iitrader.com in Chicago. “We didn’t expect them to be back until the end of Q1.” \n",
      "Libya’s National Oil Corp (NOC) said on Thursday it plans to restart the El Sharara oilfield and hopes to resume output within days after protesters agreed to suspend a strike that has blocked the field since the end of October. \n",
      "Libya’s output is still less than 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from 1.4 million bpd in July. \n",
      "Brent crude ended $3.02 a barrel lower at $107.78, the largest one-day percentage drop since late June. \n",
      "U.S. crude sank by as much as $3.08 per barrel to a low of $95.34, after breaking a key technical level.  The contract settled $2.98 lower at $95.44, its largest one-day percent drop since November 2012. \n",
      "Losses deepened earlier in the session after a report by industry group Genscape showed a one million barrel rise in stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the benchmark delivery point for U.S. oil futures, market sources said. \n",
      "Official U.S. government data, due out two days later than usual at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on Friday due to the New Year’s Day holiday, is expected to show a fifth consecutive draw in nationwide crude oil stockpiles. \n",
      "Data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showed stocks fell last week by nearly double the expectation in a Reuters poll. The decline has been largely attributed to producers’ attempts to avert taxes and is no match for U.S. production which has risen to a 25-year high, analysts said. \n",
      "Motor fuel prices matched crude’s losses as a powerful storm expected to bring heavy snow and Arctic cold to the densely populated U.S. Northeast will likely force motorists off the road, said Stephen Schork, editor of the Schork Report in Villanova, Pennsylvania. \n",
      "“I think with gasoline it could potentially be 70 million (people) in the path of two converging snowstorms and that will impact demand,” he said. “It’s already happened in the Midwest.” \n",
      "U.S. ultra low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) futures fell 2.5 percent to $2.9867 per gallon while RBOB gasoline futures  fell 3.2 percent to $2.6950. \n",
      "As well, more than 1,500 flights were cancelled in the United States due to the storm, according to web site FlightAware.com. \n",
      "“People aren’t driving, people aren’t flying,” Baruch said. “A lot of fuel is not being consumed.” \n",
      "Adding to pressure on oil, growth in factory activity in China slowed in late 2013, according to purchasing managers’ indexes published by the government and HSBC, weighed by shrinking export orders. \n",
      "U.S. stocks extended their fall in late afternoon trade on Thursday. The S&P; 500 declined 1 percent. \n",
      "A strong dollar weighed as dollar-priced commodities become more expensive for holders of other currencies. The U.S. dollar index, a measure of the dollar’s strength against a basket of currencies, rose to a two-week high. \n",
      "The market also eyed potential increased oil output from Iran. The Islamic Republic and six world powers will implement an agreement in late January obliging Tehran to suspend its most sensitive nuclear work, an Iranian official was quoted as saying on Tuesday. \n",
      "That raises the prospect of an increase in Iranian crude exports over 2014, some analysts said.   (Additional reporting by Peg Mackey in London and Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by William Hardy, Anthony Barker, Meredith Mazzilli, Diane Craft and Chris Reese)\n",

      "76ers dump Nuggets for rare winning streak \n",
      "DENVER — The Philadelphia 76ers believe they are starting to see things more clearly. \n",
      "The Denver Nuggets wouldn’t mind closing their eyes to their current woes. \n",
      "Seven Philadelphia players scored in double figures, and the 76ers enjoyed a big second quarter during a 114-102 win over Denver on Wednesday night. \n",
      "Philadelphia (10-21) won its second consecutive road game after losing its previous 13 away from home. The 76ers also won consecutive games for the first time since starting the season 3-0. \n",
      "After trailing by as many as nine points in the opening period, Philadelphia used a 44-point second quarter that was sparked by its bench to take a 68-56 lead into halftime. The 44 points were most the 76ers scored in a quarter since 1996, and the 68 was their high for a half this season. \n",
      "The consecutive wins came over the struggling Los Angeles Lakers and a Nuggets team that might best be described as lost, but the 76ers didn’t seem to mind. \n",
      "“You hope things slowly come together,” Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. “You hope you just stay the course and you don’t blink. We haven’t done anything different.” \n",
      "Added Philadelphia forward Thaddeus Young: “Our second unit did a really good job of taking advantage of the opportunity to play and picking up the defensive intensity in the game. They worked (the Nuggets’) second unit real good.” \n",
      "Denver (14-17) lost its eighth game in a row, its longest losing streak since the end of the 2002-03 season. The Nuggets let an opponent top 40 points in a quarter for the first time this season. \n",
      "After the game, first-year Nuggets coach Brian Shaw blasted his team for what he said was a lack of effort. Asked if his players are buying into his strategy, Shaw answered: “It certainly doesn’t look like that right now. \n",
      "“In terms of my philosophy, playing hard is part of any coach’s philosophy, whether it’s our team or any other team. Whether you buy into what I’m running offensively or what I’m running defensively, what should be universal is coming out and giving effort. \n",
      "“Everybody is getting a paycheck, including myself. So when it’s time to go to work, you have to go to work, and you give it everything you have and leave it on the floor, and I don’t think we’re doing that, starting with me and sprinkling down to the players.” \n",
      "Said Nuggets center J.J. Hickson: “The good thing about this league is you get 82 games. We have nowhere to go but up. We’ve hit rock bottom. \n",
      "“We need to take pride in our defense on the court.” \n",
      "Philadelphia closed the first half with a 13-2 run during which forward Evan Turner scored eight points, prompting the Pepsi Center crowd to boo the Nuggets as they left the floor. \n",
      "On the night, the 76ers shot 9-for-23 (39.1 percent) on 3-pointers, including 7-for-14 during the second quarter. Denver went 5-for-25 (20 percent) from long range. \n",
      "Turner, who returned to action Sunday after missing the previous game with right knee soreness, led the 76ers with 23 points. He added six assists, five rebounds and two steals. \n",
      "Young continued his recent strong play with 17 points and 10 rebounds. He scored 25 or more in each of his previous four games. \n",
      "All five Nuggets starters scored in double figures. Hickson had a team-high 19 points and 11 rebounds, and forward Wilson Chandler added 16 points. Guard Ty Lawson contributed 15 points and 11 assists. \n",
      "Denver pulled within 106-97 on Chandler’s 3-pointer with 3:10 remaining. However, Philadelphia scored the next five points, ending with Young’s driving basket with 1:48 to go, to put it away. \n",
      "NOTES: Philadelphia assistant coach Chad Iske spent the previous 14 seasons with the Nuggets. He was Denver’s video coordinator and an advanced scout before becoming an assistant coach in 2008. Iske is a graduate of Regis Jesuit High School in suburban Aurora, Colo. ... G Randy Foye returned to Denver’s starting lineup after coming off the bench the previous three games, and he scored 14 points. Foye started the season’s first 27 games. “He wasn’t defending well, he wasn’t rebounding, he wasn’t making plays for his teammates and he was struggling shooting the ball, so it was a combination of all of those things that landed him in the second unit,” coach Brian Shaw said. Foye had 11 points and seven assists in Monday’s loss to the Miami Heat, but Shaw said leaving Foye in the fourth quarter of a 21-point loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday enabled the guard to find his rhythm again. ... Philadelphia G Tony Wroten and Denver G Nate Robinson are cousins.\n",

      "\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Fisker Automotive, the bankrupt maker of a plug-in hybrid sports car, asked a federal judge to approve its proposed sale to a Hong Kong tycoon rather than a Chinese suitor that Fisker alleged was to blame for its failure. \n",
      "A courtroom showdown is set for Friday that will determine the future of the defunct car maker that was launched with a controversial U.S. government loan. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Kevin Gross must decide if Fisker’s business will be put to open auction or sold to an affiliate of Richard Li as the company has proposed. \n",
      "The company’s plans were thrown into doubt on Monday, when the official creditors’ committee proposed auctioning the business and presented an initial $24.725 million bid from the U.S. unit of Wanxiang Group, China’s top auto parts company. \n",
      "Fisker attacked the creditors’ proposal in a series of court filings on Wednesday with the bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware, noting that after Wanxiang bought A123 Systems Inc, a battery maker, it cut supplies to Fisker. \n",
      "“Wanxiang now seeks to profit from a bankruptcy that it helped cause,” Fisker said in a court filing. \n",
      "An attorney for the creditors’ committee disputed that, noting that Wanxiang acquired A123 months after Fisker idled its production to save cash. “Fisker was no longer producing cars at that time,” said Sunni Beville of Brown Rudnick. \n",
      "The creditors’ committee have called the Wanxiang bid proposal the best option and they also asked the bankruptcy court to allow them to sue to former Fisker director David Manion and others for improperly pushing the sale to Li. \n",
      "Hanging in the balance are the assets of a company once touted as America’s “green” rival to prestigious brands such as Maserati, but which has not made its signature Karma in more than a year. \n",
      "The company obtained a $529 million loan from the Department of Energy that was meant to promote fuel efficient cars, which in turn helped to lure private backing. \n",
      "Fisker raised more than $1.4 billion in public and private funds after its founding in 2007, but lavish spending, quality and engineering blunders and other mistakes drained the company’s coffers and delayed the launch of the Karma, several people close to the company told Reuters earlier this year. \n",
      "An entity affiliated with Li planned to buy Fisker after he paid $25 million for Fisker’s government loan, outbidding Wanxiang. Instead of using cash, the Li affiliate planned to buy Fisker’s assets using a “credit bid” of a portion of what Fisker owed on that loan, leaving other creditors with next to nothing. \n",
      "Court records show that a majority of unsecured creditors such as design consultants and suppliers voted to reject the plan to sell Fisker to Li. \n",
      "The case is In re Fisker Automotive Holdings Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 13-13087.\n",

      "\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. senators visited the Afghan president on Thursday to try to push forward talks to sign a crucial bilateral security deal and halt the release of prisoners the United States considers a threat to security. \n",
      "Afghanistan plans to release hundreds of prisoners from Bagram prison, which was handed over from U.S. control only after a deal was reached in March after intense negotiations because Washington feared dangerous inmates would be freed. \n",
      "The disagreement further strains relations between the two countries, which are already at breaking point over President Hamid Karzai’s refusal to sign a bilateral security deal to shape the post-2014 U.S. military presence in the country. \n",
      "Without the pact, Washington could pull most of its troops out after this year, when most foreign troops are due to exit. \n",
      "The senators told Karzai that releasing dangerous prisoners would irreparably damage ties with the United States, but stopped short of saying it would prompt a full military withdrawal after 2014. \n",
      "“If these releases go ahead it will do irreparable damage to the relationship,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters at a news conference in Kabul on Thursday. \n",
      "Washington considers 88 of some 650 prisoners marked for release a serious threat to security, saying they are responsible for wounding or killing 57 Afghans and 60 U.S. and coalition troops. \n",
      "It wants them to be investigated and tried. Afghanistan says there is not enough evidence to keep them detained. \n",
      "Karzai has called the so-called “zero option” over the pact an empty threat and suggested any deal can wait until after the presidential elections in April. The United States says it needs time to prepare a post-2014 mission and set an end of year deadline that has now passed. \n",
      "The visiting officials gave no indication of how much longer the government might wait to sign the security deal but stopped short of saying releasing the prisoners would drive a final nail in the coffin of talks. \n",
      "“We’re going to have to just wait and see what happens ... we can’t go any further in our comments except that it does damage,” Senator John McCain, also a Republican, told reporters. \n",
      "“As a result of our long meeting with president Karzai we have narrowed those differences and I believe we can look forward to signing the Bilateral Security Agreement ... sooner rather than later.” \n",
      "Karzai’s spokesman was not immediately available to comment on whether the president would consider intervening to stop the release. \n",
      "Billions of dollars in foreign aid will also hinge on a deal being reached to allow U.S. troops to stay beyond 2014. \n",
      "Afghanistan relies on donors for most of its budget and would have difficulty funding its police and army without international help. \n",
      "Highlighting the increasingly violent struggle against the Taliban insurgency, a motorcycle bomb exploded in a market in Logar province on Thursday, south of the capital, killing nine people and wounding 18 others, according to local officials. \n",

      "China Gold eyes Canadian purchase, but says prices still steep\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "VANCOUVER, Jan 2 (Reuters) - China Gold International , a mid-sized Canadian-based company with two mines in China, is eager to make an acquisition in Canada, but asset prices remain very high despite a bombed-out mining sector, a company official said on Thursday. \n",
      "At a time when small- and medium-sized miners are struggling to raise funds as investors have cooled on the sector, China Gold is in the enviable position of having ready access to finance through its biggest shareholder, China National Gold, a Chinese state-owned enterprise. \n",
      "China National Gold is China’s only state-owned gold mining enterprise and China’s biggest gold producer. It owns 39 percent of Vancouver-based China Gold and is perhaps best known for its failed attempt to buy African Barrick Gold a year ago from Barrick Gold Corp. \n",
      "“You have seen market cap drops. But the asset values are still up there. People are refusing to sell at lower prices. We have tried a few times,” Jerry Xie, executive vice president of China Gold, told Reuters. \n",
      "He said the company would “prefer to find something in Canada” but was not willing to overpay for it. \n",
      "Shares of gold and base metal companies plunged in 2013 due to weaker metal prices, soaring mining development costs and massive write-downs on acquisitions made at the peak of the mining boom. The S&P; TSX Global Gold Index fell 48 percent last year. \n",
      "Mergers and acquisitions have also fallen sharply, though a few deals announced last month, including Asanko Gold’s  planned purchase of PMI Gold, indicating that tough conditions in the industry may spur more deals as companies combine to cut corporate costs and strengthen balance sheets. \n",
      "China Gold’s ideal acquisition would be a property containing some 3 million ounces of gold or 1 million tonnes of copper, and with a completed feasibility study, Xie said. \n",
      "In 2012, China Gold produced 139,443 ounces of gold and 25.8 million pounds of copper, but expects to expand this to 260,000 ounces of gold by 2015 and 176 million pounds of copper by 2016 following major expansions at both its mines in China.\n",

      "Wall Street watchdog puts spotlight on firms hiring risky brokers\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - Former Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith has taken over as head coach of the struggling Tampa Bay Buccaneers on a five-year contract, the National Football League (NFL) team announced on Thursday. \n",
      "Smith, who was linebackers coach at Tampa Bay from 1996 to 2000 as part of Tony Dungy’s initial staff, replaces Greg Schiano, who was fired by the club on Monday after two mediocre seasons in charge. \n",
      "“Today is an exciting day for the Buccaneer organization, and the entire Tampa Bay community, as we welcome back Lovie Smith,” Buccaneers co-chairman Bryan Glazer said in a statement. \n",
      "“We knew from the start of our search that he was the ideal man to lead our team into a new era of Buccaneer football. Lovie is an accomplished and very well-respected head coach who has enjoyed success at every level of his 30-year career.” \n",
      "Smith, 55, was 81-63 after nine seasons with the Bears, leading them to three division titles and the Super Bowl in 2006 when they were beaten by the Indianapolis Colts. Under his guidance, the Bears defense ranked among the best in the NFL, \n",
      "He was sacked by Chicago in December 2012 after the team ended the season with a 10-6 record but missed the playoffs for a fifth time in six years. \n",
      "Smith will take over a Buccaneers franchise in urgent need of a re-build after finishing a lowly 15th in the 16-team National Football Conference last year. \n",
      "In a bid to wipe the slate clean, Tampa Bay dropped Schiano as coach on Monday and also ditched general manager Mark Dominik. \n",
      "“The results over the past two years have not lived up to our standards and we believe the time has come to find a new direction,” Glazer said. \n",

      "© 2018 Reuters. All Rights Reserved.4 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - Wall Street brokerages that hire stockbrokers who have a track record of misconduct should expect to show examiners how they will curb future wrongdoing, the industry’s watchdog said on Thursday in an overview of issues it will review in 2014. \n",
      "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said it will review the process that firms use to research problem brokers before hiring them. The industry-funded watchdog also wants to know whether firms take extra measures to supervise the brokers to prevent future misdeeds, such as sales abuses involving client accounts. \n",
      "“You have to know your customer and the product you’re selling. But firms also really have to know who they’re hiring,” Susan Axelrod, FINRA’s head of regulatory operations, told Reuters. \n",
      "FINRA, which routinely examines the industry’s nearly 4,200 securities firms to gauge their compliance with securities industry rules, published its annual list of “examination priorities” on Thursday. The regulator’s beefed-up interest in problem brokers follows its efforts last year to rein in brokers with troublesome professional histories, including numerous customer complaints or sanctions such as fines and suspensions. \n",
      "FINRA said it will also launch a specialized enforcement team in 2014, composed of four to six lawyers, to prosecute brokers who pose a high risk to the investing public. Sanctions could include fines, suspensions, or being barred from the industry. \n",
      "FINRA said only a “small number” of the industry’s 636,200 brokers engage in a pattern of misbehavior that could harm investors. \n",
      "FINRA has barred 22 high-risk brokers from the securities industry since February 2013, around the time it started to fast-track investigations and disciplinary cases involving risky brokers, Axelrod said. \n",
      "Nonetheless, some brokers with checkered pasts remain in the industry. Axelrod said that sometimes occurs when brokers were disciplined for selling troubled products in which investors lost money, such as auction-rate securities, but blame is placed on the firm rather than the individual broker and the brokers are not forced out of the industry. The details do appear on the brokers’ public records. \n",
      "In other cases, investors do not want to speak to FINRA about their dealings with a broker, which makes it difficult to prove a case, Axelrod said. \n",
      "“You’d love to have a world in which all persons who are at risk of making mistakes would be knocked out of the industry, but you have to do it in a way that’s fair and has some balance, Richard Ketchum, FINRA’s chairman and chief executive said. \n",
      "The regulator said it is also honing in on potential risks posed by brokers who worked at firms that were expelled from the securities industry. Many of the brokers are not barred because of their firms’ wrongdoing and find work at other firms. They may, however, bring “unethical or illegal practices” with them, FINRA said, adding that it is identifying and monitoring these firms and individuals. \n",
      "Firms that hire high-risk brokers strictly to boost their bottom line should expect to explain to examiners what hiring practices and procedures they are taking to bolster supervision, Axelrod said. Brokers should also expect to field questions. \n",
      "Sanctions stemming from poor policies or the hiring of too many high-risk brokers will depend on the severity of what FINRA is able to prove, Axelrod said. They could range from fines to shutting down a firm. \n",
      "Other issues FINRA will review include sales of securities that are sensitive to interest rates, cyber security and firms’ practices for rolling over investors’ retirement plan savings into individual retirement accounts. \n",

      "DUBAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Oman’s 2014 budget plan will slow growth in state spending as the government grapples with rising pressure on its finances, according to figures provided by state news agency ONA. \n",
      "Spending this year is projected at 13.5 billion rials ($35.1 billion), up 5 percent from the original expenditure plan in the 2013 budget, which envisaged a 29 percent leap from the previous year, ONA reported. \n",
      "Revenues in 2014 are estimated at 11.7 billion rials, up 4.5 percent from the 2013 plan. Finance Minister Darwish al-Balushi is due to announce the budget formally at a news conference on Thursday. \n",
      "Although this year’s budget projects a deficit, it conservatively assumes an average crude oil price of $85 a barrel; Brent crude is currently trading around $111.0, suggesting Oman’s revenues could be much larger than projected and it may actually post a surplus in 2014. \n",
      "Nevertheless, Oman is under increasing pressure to rein in spending growth after expanding expenditure sharply since 2011, when there were scattered street protests demanding more jobs and an end to corruption. \n",
      "The government responded to the protests by boosting welfare programmes, public sector wages and job creation schemes to ensure social peace. The International Monetary Fund has warned Oman will have to reform its spending and find new revenue sources in the next few years to avoid falling into a pattern of ballooning budget deficits.\n",

      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The state of Pennsylvania appealed on Thursday against a December decision from the state Supreme Court that struck down parts of an oil and gas law. \n",
      "The Pennsylvania Supreme Court voted 4-2 in mid-December saying key provisions in Act 13, a 2012 law that governs oil and gas drilling, is unconstitutional. \n",
      "In a state known for its shale gas bounty, the decision broadened the rights of local governments to restrict the controversial fracking process within their city limits, dealing a blow to oil and gas interests. \n",

      "The ruling followed similar cases in New York state earlier this year that allowed two small towns to restrict natural gas drilling within their limits. Three cities in Colorado also voted against fracking last year. \n",

      "Chiefs look to extend Cinderella season in battle with Colts\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - Two teams that know the peaks and valleys of the National Football League all too well clash on Saturday when the Kansas City Chiefs visit the Indianapolis Colts for a wild-card showdown. \n",
      "The Chiefs, one year removed from a two-win campaign, are the Cinderella story of this NFL season after opening with nine straight victories and clinching their first playoff spot in four years. \n",
      "A season ago it was the Colts who reached the playoffs one year after going a dismal 2-14. \n",
      "But the clock will strike midnight for one team on Saturday in Indianapolis where the AFC South champion Colts (11-5) will host the wild card Chiefs (11-5). \n",
      "“Any time you can be a part of the turnaround, it’s a special feeling,” said Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith. “These guys have worked hard and deserve a ton of credit. \n",
      "“It’s special to be a part of this.” \n",
      "The Chiefs, seeking their first playoff win in 20 years, can attribute their revival to head coach Andy Reid, who arrived after being fired by the Philadelphia Eagles, and hard luck quarterback Smith. \n",
      "Smith, the top pick in the 2005 draft, was never able to silence critics during seven turbulent years with San Francisco before finally losing his starting job to backup Colin Kaepernick midway through last season. \n",
      "More steady than spectacular, Smith has never thrown for more than 3,313 yards in a season but finds ways to win, posting a sparkling 30-9-1 record over the last three years. \n",
      "The Colts are also led by a top draft pick in quarterback Andrew Luck, who has had big shoes to fill after taking over for future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning. \n",
      "In two seasons, Luck has guided Indianapolis to 22 wins and passed for 8,196 yards, the most ever by a player in his first two campaigns. \n",
      "But while Luck has exceeded expectations the second year quarterback must still prove he can deliver when it counts most and win a playoff game. \n",
      "“We know the postseason’s a whole different ball game and it’s one-and-done,” said Luck. “We’re excited about that.” \n",
      "Luck, who tossed 23 touchdowns and just nine interceptions, will be wary of an opportunistic Chiefs defense that struggled late in the season but still finished with the second most takeaways (36). \n",
      "The Chiefs offensive line will have to be on the lookout for Colts linebacker Robert Mathis who led the NFL with 19.5 sacks. \n",
      "After a mid-season swoon that saw Indianapolis drop three-of-five contests, the Colts have found their stride and head into the playoffs riding a three-game win streak, including a 23-7 thrashing of Chiefs two weeks ago. \n",
      "In contrast, following their spectacular 9-0 start the Chiefs sputtered down the home stretch losing five-of-seven including their last two. \n",

      "UPDATE 1-Citigroup paid $250 mln to resolve U.S. mortgage suit\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. paid $250 million to taxpayer-owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to settle a lawsuit over soured mortgage securities, the regulator of the two housing finance firms said on Thursday. \n",
      "General Electric Co. also paid $6.25 million to settle a similar suit, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said in a statement. Ally Financial Inc, the former parent of bankrupt Residential Capital LLC, paid $475 million. \n",
      "Citi, GE and Ally had previously settled the claims in 2013, but none had disclosed the financial terms. \n",
      "The banks are among 18 financial institutions that were sued in 2011 for allegedly misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the biggest provider of housing finance in the United States, into buying more than $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. \n",
      "Six institutions have since settled the accusations. GE and Citi were the first two to resolve the claims in early 2013, but the FHFA kept the terms confidential as they negotiated additional settlements. \n",
      "In October, JPMorgan agreed to pay $4 billion to resolve its lawsuit, and in December, Deutsche Bank entered a $1.9 billion accord with the agency. \n",
      "A seventh bank, Wells Fargo, which the FHFA never formally sued, also paid $335 million in November to resolve similar claims. \n",
      "In total, the U.S. has recouped nearly $8 billion through the settlements, the housing regulator said. The lawsuits accused the firms of violating securities laws and in some cases, committing fraud. \n",
      "The settlements came as the institutions suffered a series of disappointments in the litigation, failing to win dismissal of the lawsuits, among other setbacks. \n",
      "The deals are expected to be reflected in financial statements for Fannie and Freddie some time this year. If they wind up boosting earnings, profits will go straight to the U.S. Treasury in the form of dividend payments. \n",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently back about half of existing U.S. home loans, were seized by the government in 2008 as mortgage losses mounted. They have received $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds to stay afloat, while paying about $185.2 billion in dividends to the government for that support. \n",

      "Ride service Uber, brash darling of Silicon Valley, stalks new markets\n",
      "9 Min Read\n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick knows the value of a good controversy. \n",
      "After his upstart company, which lets people summon rides at the touch of a smartphone button, provoked a flurry of social media outrage in December over pricing policies that can result in exorbitant fares, Kalanick addressed prospective New Year’s Eve customers. \n",
      "“If you absolutely need a ride between 1 and 3 a.m., Uber will be very reliable,” Kalanick said in a YouTube video. “But it will be a pricey ride, and you just have to accept that.” The company’s pricing policies can sometimes result in fares that are eight times higher than usual. \n",
      "Like the message or not, plenty of people heard it - and fewer complaints emerged about Uber’s New Year’s Eve rates. \n",
      "Kalanick has taken a similarly tough tack with regulators, local officials, taxi-company foes and emerging competitors as he moves to build Uber into a global force. \n",
      "But it will take a lot more than a popular smartphone app, a loyal Silicon Valley following and a knack for turning free-market ideology into publicity to fulfill Kalanick’s vision of a “lifestyle and logistics” company that delivers far more than rides. \n",
      "Uber has entered more than 60 markets, ranging from its hometown of San Francisco to Berlin to Tokyo. Leaked financials in December indicate that the company, which began connecting passengers with drivers of vehicles for hire about 3-1/2 years ago, is generating $200 million a year in revenue beyond what it pays to drivers. \n",
      "Investors, led by Google Inc’s Google Ventures, have given Uber around $400 million and valued it at $3.5 billion. With a service that stitches together the buzziest categories in entrepreneurship - among them mapping, smartphones, and local services - Uber is widely seen as one of the hottest properties in Silicon Valley. \n",
      "Yet Uber still faces daunting regulatory hurdles that have left it shut out of major markets such as Miami. Lawsuits, many from taxi companies, are piling up. Competitors such as Hailo, Sidecar and Lyft are coming on strong. And aside from publicity stunts involving delivery of kittens, ice cream and Christmas trees, Uber has yet to provide anything beyond rides. \n",
      "Delivery “can become an extremely complex thing,” said Kerry Rice, a digital media analyst at Needham. “It’s about the scheduling and the software and the ability to manage a fleet.” \n",
      "Delivery is currently a hot topic among Internet retailers, with companies like eBay Inc, Amazon.com Inc, and Google all experimenting with same-day shipping. But it has proven a graveyard in the past for dot-com companies, such as Webvan and Kosmo, which had dreams of challenging the global delivery leaders. \n",
      "Uber declined to comment on its plans. \n",
      "When Uber started offering its service in 2010, it was a way to connect riders with town car drivers who had extra time between scheduled gigs. The riders sign up via an app, with a portion of their fare going to Uber and a portion to the drivers, who are independent contractors. \n",
      "It developed a loyal following in the first cities where it launched - including San Francisco, New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. - in part because Uber served up rides in areas with a dearth of taxis. The rides, in black town cars, offered more pizzazz and comfort than a taxi, but without the advance-booking that limo services typically require. \n",
      "Uber also proved masterful at harnessing publicity tied to one-time events. In Boston, for example, it offered free rides along a subway line that was shut down for repairs. \n",
      "The company has adroitly tapped in to social media to rally fans, who attend mixers, lobby politicians, sign Facebook petitions and speak up at local hearings that affecting Uber. \n",
      "In 2012, the Washington D.C. city council was weighing a measure that would make Uber sedans cost five times the price of cabs - until Uber fans bombarded council members with emails and tweets. The council then passed an amendment allowing Uber to do business, generating even more publicity. \n",
      "But there have been plenty of regulatory setbacks too. In some cities, such as Miami; Austin, Texas; and Vancouver, British Columbia, local regulations keep Uber out, typically by requiring minimum fares or minimum wait periods between the time a customer requests a ride and the time that customer steps in to the car. \n",
      "In other areas where Uber already operates, lobbying by the taxi industry has resulted in efforts to change the law to shut down app-based ride services. In Seattle, the city council is considering limiting such services to 100 part-time drivers a week and requiring special licenses. \n",
      "Uber chalked up some regulatory wins during 2013, including in Dallas and Denver. But the company does not do business in one quarter of the 20 largest cities in the United States. \n",
      "The taxi industry is also fighting Uber in court. In Chicago, local cab companies have filed a federal lawsuit alleging various illegal practices by Uber, including misleading marketing and unfair competition. Boston cabbies have filed a similar case. Uber declined to comment. \n",
      "Separately, a group of California Uber drivers is seeking class status for a lawsuit alleging they get stiffed on tips and business expenses such as gasoline. \n",
      "“The allegations made against our company are entirely without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously,” an Uber spokesman said. “Our technology platform has allowed thousands of drivers to generate an independent wage and build their own small businesses.” \n",
      "Uber recently won a state court victory in Massachusetts, where the city of Cambridge unsuccessfully sued to try to overturn a state agency’s ruling that Uber could operate while federal officials evaluate the company’s technology. No precedent-setting federal cases have been decided yet. \n",
      "California provides Uber’s surest footing in regulatory terms: the state’s Public Utilities Commission gave app-based ride companies a green light in September. But in October, Uber, seeking to avoid CPUC oversight entirely, filed a petition for rehearing, arguing the body does not have jurisdiction over technology companies. \n",
      "Meanwhile, Uber is going toe to toe with competitors such as Sidecar, which allows ordinary people to provide paid rides in their own cars. Uber has launched UberX, a lower-priced service that uses mid-range cars rather than the black town cars on which it built its reputation. \n",
      "“Travis (Kalanick) is not ceding ground at any price point,” said Bill Gurley, a partner at venture-capital firm Benchmark who has backed Uber since early 2011. \n",
      "Gurley and others are betting there are enough people willing to pay a premium - even a very large one - for a reliable ride, or eventually for delivery services. One of Uber’s innovations is so-called surge pricing, under which rates go up at times of high demand or low supply of cars. \n",
      "During a recent snowstorm in New York, some Uber users tweeted photos of notices from the company that their fare would be as much as 8.5 times normal. At Sidecar, by comparison, surge pricing is also used, but it is capped at three times the normal rates, a spokeswoman said. \n",
      "Kalanick defends surge pricing as both a matter of free-market principle and as the best way to assure that people can get a ride when they really need one. \n",
      "“You’ll always be notified in BIG, BOLD print if surge pricing is in effect,” the company wrote in a December 30 blog post, linking to the video of Kalanick explaining the policy. \n",
      "Many customers still perceive surge pricing as price gouging, and the policy will not endear the company to regulators. Yet even critics sometimes appear to sustain a love-hate relationship with Uber and its combative CEO. \n",
      "“You can try to rationalize it, but it won’t change the ill feelings most of us have toward your service,” a Los Angeles customer calling herself Pasta Versaucy tweeted to Kalanick on Wednesday, in reference to high New Year’s Eve rates. \n",
      "A little while later, she sent out another tweet. “Hypothetically speaking: can I order an @Uber to charter a burger to my house? Because I totally would.” \n",
      "Kalanick, who had engaged in some New Year’s Twitter banter with her and other critics, let the question go unanswered. \n",

      "* December revenue boosted by higher holiday visitor numbers \n",
      "* Analysts see 2014 revenue growth of 10-14 percent \n",
      "By Farah Master \n",
      "HONG KONG, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Macau raked in $45 billion in gambling revenue in 2013, 18.6% more than in 2012, as the world’s biggest and China’s only casino hub continued to blaze ahead of rival gaming destinations. \n",
      "Macau, which earns seven times more than Las Vegas, has seen revenue soar in recent years thanks to its proximity to vast numbers of increasingly wealthy Chinese dazzled by fortress-sized resorts such as Sands China Ltd’s  Venetian Macao and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd’s  Galaxy Macau. \n",
      "Improved access to the region boosted revenue last year from China’s growing middle class, offsetting slowing VIP growth brought about in part by the government in Beijing’s campaign against conspicuous spending by public officers. \n",
      "In December, revenue grew 18.5 percent from a year earlier to 33.5 billion patacas ($4.19 billion) thanks to a rise in holiday-season visitors. That compared with the 13 percent to 17 percent estimates of six analysts. \n",
      "Those analysts see 2014 growth of 10 percent to 14 percent partly because there will not be any new casino openings until 2015, meaning there will be no new gaming capacity or additional hotel rooms to keep pace with growth. \n",
      "Projects under construction are subject to a new ruling whereby the local government allocates gaming tables based on the inclusion of non-gaming features. The former Portuguese colony is trying to diversify its sources of revenue, over 80 percent of which comes from the gambling industry. \n",
      "Casino mogul Steve Wynn, through his Wynn Macau Ltd  unit, is building a $4 billion floral-themed resort featuring an artificial lake and dancing fountains like the Bellagio in Las Vegas. U.S. billionaire Sheldon Adelson of Sands China is building a miniature Eiffel Tower dubbed the Parisian which will have a mall and convention space. \n",
      "Revenue growth of big-spending VIPs slowed last year as the central government clamped down on ostentatiousness among officials. At the same time, improved infrastructure has helped more of the middle class reach Macau. \n",
      "The growth of the so-called premium mass segment, where customers spend anywhere from a few thousand yuan to under one million yuan ($165,200), is helping casino operators such as Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd generate double digit revenue. \n",
      "China’s expanding high-speed train network and projects such as a 38 billion yuan bridge connecting Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai on the mainland are reducing travelling times to Macau. The development of neighbouring Hengqin island - which is also part of mainland China - is also likely to boost visitors to Macau. \n",
      "Only around 4 percent of Chinese - or about 52 million people - have visited Macau, casino executives and industry watchers estimate, leaving ample room for growth. \n",
      "This outlook helped Macau’s Hong Kong-listed gaming stocks surge 42 percent to 132 percent last year, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 3 percent. \n",
      "“Macau is expensive... but it’s hard to push the ‘Sell’ button,” wrote brokerage Macquarie in its most recent gaming report. \n",

      "UPDATE 2-Spain's Codere in debt talks to avoid insolvency\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "MADRID, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Spanish gaming group Codere  said on Thursday it is seeking protection from creditors and starting talks to avoid insolvency, after struggling to keep up with debt payments in recent months because of higher tax bills and other costs. \n",
      "The company is the latest in Spanish to run into trouble even as the country slowly emerges from recession, with bankruptcies handled in court in 2013 up 15 percent from the year before, according to official data. \n",
      "Codere’s problems, however, stem mainly from its overseas businesses. The company blamed its cash shortage on the closure of several gaming outlets in Mexico, license renewal costs in Argentina and tax increases in various countries. \n",
      "Codere had 1.27 billion euros ($1.73 billion) of debt at the end of last September, according to company filings, including three bond issues and other loans. It has up to four months to reach a deal with banks and investors. \n",
      "The loss-making company made several late payments on bond coupons in recent months as it tried to win time to restructure its debts. It warned on Thursday that it may be unable to repay a 127 million euro loan due on Jan. 5 if it does not first reach an agreement with lenders. \n",
      "International private equity firm Blackstone Group LP , through its credit arm GSO Capital Partners, and hedge fund Canyon Capital LLC are among investors that have bought up Codere debt in recent months. \n",
      "The two U.S. firms gave the company extra credit lines to tide it over and help it pay coupons. \n",
      "Codere has become a prominent example of how the opaque market for credit default swaps (CDS) can drive creditors to influence a company’s debt payment schedule rather than just hedge their bets on its debt. \n",
      "In September, Codere made an intentional late coupon payment on $300 million of its bonds that allowed it to gain consent from its creditors, which traded on CDS, to push back its debt maturities. \n",
      "GSO and Canyon benefited from the deal because it enabled them to take over a 100 million euro ($137 million) bank loan to Codere with consent from the company’s creditors. The two debt fund managers also lent Codere 35 million euros to make its delayed coupon payment. \n",
      "Blackstone was an investor in Codere’s CDS while Canyon was not, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. GSO and Canyon declined to comment. \n",
      "Sources close to Codere’s debt talks have said bondholder debts could be cut by half in a debt-for-equity swap. \n",
      "Codere posted a 93 million euro loss for the first nine months of 2013. Its core profit of 172.3 million euros, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), was down nearly 27 percent from the year before.\n",

      "By Laurence Fletcher \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the euro and the yen on Thursday with investors focused on whether U.S. economic data will support the case for the Federal Reserve gradually scaling back its bond-buying stimulus this year. \n",
      "The euro - the strongest-performing major currency in 2013 but historically a weaker performer at the start of a calendar year - dropped 0.6 percent to $1.3665. \n",
      "The U.S. currency hit another five-year high of 105.45 yen, its strongest level versus the Japanese currency since October 2008, and was last trading up 0.2 percent at 105.41 yen. \n",

      "Threatening snowstorm may be early test for N.Y. Mayor de Blasio\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is coming into City Hall with a sweeping mandate to address the city’s most vexing problems, from economic inequality to police and community relations. \n",
      "But first, he will have to manage a snowstorm. \n",
      "A winter storm that is due to hit on Thursday, de Blasio’s second day in office, could pose the first challenge to the new mayor, as he tries to enact a progressive agenda while ensuring the city of more than 8 million people is well managed. \n",
      "De Blasio succeeds Michael Bloomberg, who had no political experience when he took office in 2001 but had founded and run the successful company that takes his name. De Blasio, a Democrat, most recently was the city’s public advocate and, before that, served two terms in the city council. \n",
      "“This will be first test, and he’s got to pull it off as close to flawlessly as he can,” said Douglas Muzzio, a professor at Baruch College at the City University of New York. “He’s got to send the message, ‘I can run this joint.’” \n",
      "Storms have famously complicated the political lives of New York mayors. In the winter of 1969, a storm that dropped 15 inches (40 cm) of snow created a political crisis for Mayor John Lindsay, who was faulted for the city’s slow response. \n",
      "In 2010, Bloomberg came under fire for his handling of a blizzard that shut down some subway lines for days. \n",
      "“If we see a situation worsening we’re going to take very aggressive action. So it’s very much on our screens,” de Blasio told reporters this week. \n",
      "De Blasio, who is moving into the mayoral residence of Gracie Mansion in Manhattan, asserted his outer-borough credentials by mentioning that he remains a homeowner in the borough of Brooklyn. \n",
      "New York City consists of five counties known as boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. \n",
      "Bloomberg, who was first elected as a Republican but dropped his party affiliation, was criticized for letting snow pile up in Queens and allowing large parts of Brooklyn go unplowed for days in 2010. \n",
      "Regardless of what Mother Nature sends the city’s way, de Blasio has his work cut out for him as he kicks off his first week in office. \n",
      "De Blasio has said one of his first acts will be to dismantle the horse-and-buggy industry in Central Park, which has long been a tourist draw but has been the target of animal-rights groups. \n",
      "Perhaps the defining issue of de Blasio’s campaign for mayor was the issue of stop and frisk, a police tactic that critics say has led to racial profiling of young black and Latino men in low-income neighborhoods. \n",
      "At the height of the Democratic primary last summer, de Blasio - who is white and whose wife, Chirlane McCray, is black - began broadcasting an ad that featured his mixed race son, Dante, and spelled out de Blasio’s criticism of the tactic. \n",
      "The ad boosted de Blasio’s popularity among black and Latino voters and helped push policing to the top of the debate. \n",
      "But first, de Blasio will have to quiet critics who say he lacks the management experience to be a great mayor. \n",
      "Muzzio predicted de Blasio would rise to the occasion. \n",
      "“Those types of events, they’re defining in a way that a legislative victory is not,” he said, adding half-jokingly: “You’ll see de Blasio riding a snow plow. There will not be a screwup.”   (Reporting By Edith Honan)\n",

      "An Error has occured\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Expanding access to Medicaid, a major plank of President Barack Obama’s health reform law, could increase emergency room visits by people on the healthcare program for the poor rather than decrease them, results of a study published on Thursday suggest. \n",
      "A unique experiment in Oregon in which residents were randomly given Medicaid insurance cards, showed their visits to the emergency room increased by 40 percent, a sobering statistic as many states face an influx of new Medicaid patients under the \n",
      "new law. \n",
      "The study, published in the journal Science, suggests simply providing insurance coverage to low-income Americans will not be enough to curb their use of emergency rooms, which for many has been the only place they can turn when health problems become acute and more costly to treat. \n",
      "The research, based on records from thousands of emergency room visits, did not shed light on why ER visits increased. \n",
      "Opponents of the Affordable Care Act seized on the study as evidence that the law will lead to higher costs for the healthcare system rather than save money over time. \n",
      "The law, popularly known as Obamacare, allows states to expand Medicaid to millions more of their residents. Coverage under the new criteria, which have been adopted in some form by 26 states, took effect on January 1. \n",
      "The Obama administration estimated in September that Medicaid enrollment will increase by 8.7 million in 2014, nearly all as a result of the Obamacare expansion. \n",
      "The findings seem to counter Obama’s assurances that his medical coverage overhaul will ease pressure on emergency rooms and suggest ER spending could increase by half a billion dollars per year, said Michael Cannon, a healthcare expert at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington. \n",
      "Cannon based that estimate on the study authors’ estimate that Medicaid increases annual spending in the emergency department by about $120 per covered individual. \n",
      "Dr David Ansell, chief medical officer of Rush University Medical Center, which serves low-income patients from Chicago’s West and South sides, said he was not surprised by the findings, noting that the uninsured have been “trained” to turn to the emergency department for care. \n",
      "“We will change behavior when we change people’s experiences. It will take time,” he said. \n",
      "Some proponents of Medicaid expansion say the coverage will encourage people to first seek care with primary care doctors, who can help identify health problems with preventive screenings and manage chronic ailments, reducing the need for high-cost care in an emergency department. \n",
      "“What we find is that Medicaid increases emergency department use,” said study lead author Sarah Taubman of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a non-partisan research group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \n",
      "To study this issue, Taubman and colleagues turned to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a study in which the state randomly picked a group of low-income adults to receive insurance coverage under its Medicaid program. \n",
      "Taubman’s team examined emergency room records for roughly 25,000 low-income adults in the Portland area over a period of 18 months. Of those, 9,626 were selected to receive Medicaid and 15,020 served as a control group. \n",
      "They found that among people who got Medicaid, emergency department visits per person went up by 0.4 percent over 18 months compared with similar uninsured individuals. \n",
      "“It’s an increase of about 40 percent,” Taubman said. \n",
      "Taubman said the lottery gives a rare opportunity to study the policy change using a randomized trial, an especially rigorous type of study, lending added confidence in the findings. \n",
      "The findings “explode the myth that health insurance access will reduce the strain on emergency services,” a major driver of healthcare spending in the United States, Raymond Fishman of Columbia Business School wrote in an accompanying commentary published in the same journal. \n",
      "Twenty-five mostly Republican-run states have rejected the Medicaid expansion, arguing that the initially generous federal subsidies to the states will taper off and leave them with a huge healthcare bill. \n",

      "UPDATE 3--Spain's Codere in debt talks to avoid insolvency\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "MADRID, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Spanish gaming group Codere  said on Thursday it is seeking protection from creditors and starting talks to avoid insolvency, after struggling to keep up with debt payments in recent months because of higher tax bills and other costs. \n",
      "The company is the latest in Spanish to run into trouble even as the country slowly emerges from recession, with bankruptcies handled in court in 2013 up 15 percent from the year before, according to official data. \n",
      "Codere’s problems, however, stem mainly from its overseas businesses. The company blamed its cash shortage on the closure of several gaming outlets in Mexico, license renewal costs in Argentina and tax increases in various countries. \n",
      "Codere had 1.27 billion euros ($1.73 billion) of debt at the end of last September, according to company filings, including three bond issues and other loans. It has up to four months to reach a deal with banks and investors. \n",
      "The loss-making company made several late payments on bond coupons in recent months as it tried to win time to restructure its debts. It warned on Thursday that it may be unable to repay a 127 million euro loan due on Jan. 5 if it does not first reach an agreement with lenders. \n",
      "International private equity firm Blackstone Group LP , through its credit arm GSO Capital Partners, and hedge fund Canyon Capital LLC are among investors that have bought up Codere debt in recent months. \n",
      "The two U.S. firms gave the company extra credit lines to tide it over and help it pay coupons. \n",
      "Codere has become a prominent example of how the opaque market for credit default swaps (CDS) can drive creditors to influence a company’s debt payment schedule rather than just hedge their bets on its debt. \n",
      "In September 2013, Codere made an intentional late coupon payment on $300 million of its bonds that allowed it to gain consent from its creditors, which traded on CDS, to push back the debt maturities of a 100 million euro ($137 million) loan package. \n",
      "By then, GSO and Canyon were investors in that loan, snapping up the debt in the open market earlier that year. The two debt fund managers also lent Codere 35 million euros to make its delayed coupon payment. \n",
      "Blackstone was an investor in Codere’s CDS while Canyon was not, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. GSO and Canyon declined to comment. \n",
      "Sources close to Codere’s debt talks have said bondholder debts could be cut by half in a debt-for-equity swap. \n",
      "Codere posted a 93 million euro loss for the first nine months of 2013. Its core profit of 172.3 million euros, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), was down nearly 27 percent from the year before.\n",

      "Connect the dots: infant mortality, graft and elephant poaching\n",
      "\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - What do infant mortality and elephant poaching have in common? Plenty, according to conservation groups. \n",
      "Researchers have for the first time made clear connections between elephant poaching in Africa, which has been surging to meet soaring ivory demand in Asia, and factors such as poverty, as shown by high rates of child deaths, and corruption. \n",
      "These links have always been suspected but never pinned down with hard data. \n",
      "The findings come in a report prepared for an African elephant summit in Botswana in December by groups including TRAFFIC, which tracks the global trade in wildlife products, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. \n",
      "Areas where child mortality and poverty are worst also see higher levels of elephant poaching, but poor villagers typically do not benefit from the illicit ivory trade. \n",
      "In this regard, the ivory trade - with its long and blood-stained history - is similar to other extractive industries in Africa, which have been exploited to meet demand elsewhere with few rewards for local people. \n",
      "Demand for ivory - used for carvings and valued for millennia for its color and texture - has been rising sharply in newly affluent Asian countries, notably China, fuelling a new wave of elephant slaughter. \n",
      "Following a decline in the 1990s, poaching of the world’s largest land mammal has risen dramatically and in 2012 an estimated 15,000 elephants were illegally killed at 42 sites in Africa monitored by MIKE - the U.N.-backed program for Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants. \n",
      "Since 2010, elephant poaching levels in Africa have exceeded 5 percent of the total population - a tipping point because killings are now outpacing the animals’ birth rate. \n",
      "In a related trend, the killing of rhinos for their horns - used in traditional medicine in Vietnam and China - has also soared, notably in South Africa, home to the vast majority of the animals. \n",
      "According to South African government statistics, as of December 19, a record 946 rhinos had been poached in the country in 2013, compared to 668 in all of 2012. \n",
      "The report found a striking link between infant mortality rates - measured by the number of deaths of infants under one year old per 10,000 live births - and the illegal killing of elephants. \n",
      "“Human infant mortality, which is interpreted as a proxy for poverty, is the single strongest site-level correlate ... with sites suffering from higher levels of poverty experiencing higher levels of elephant poaching,” the report said. \n",
      "The relationship between poverty and poaching - in Africa and elsewhere - has long been assumed because wildlife is a source of food or money for impoverished rural dwellers. \n",
      "But links between measurements of poverty and living standards, such as infant mortality, and the illicit killing of elephants, have not been made before with the kind of clarity that researchers have found in the data over the past two years. \n",
      "Julian Blanc, a co-author of the study and acting coordinator for MIKE, told Reuters infant mortality was the best barometer for poverty because data for it, based on work by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network, exists at local levels. \n",
      "It can therefore be linked to localized incidents of elephant poaching, making it far more useful than other measurements such as per capita GDP, which can give a skewed picture, especially in countries with high levels of inequality. \n",
      "Ziama in Guinea, Niassa in Mozambique, and Bangassou in Central African Republic were the three areas covered in the report with the highest rates of infant mortality, ranging from 1,240 to almost 1,400 deaths per 10,000 live births. \n",
      "All three areas also had extremely high levels of elephant poaching. In the case of Ziama, its elephant population is small but has been reduced by over half in the past few years. \n",
      "The next four areas in the infant mortality rankings were all found in Democratic Republic of Congo. \n",
      "The report also found, using Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, that at the national level “high poaching levels are more prevalent in countries where governance is weaker, and vice versa”. \n",
      "Poverty and governance are the “enabling” factors for poaching, with consumer demand the other key link in the chain. \n",
      "Poor governance and high poverty levels overlap between countries such as Congo and Central African Republic, which are also areas where local people see little value in elephant populations. \n",
      "“In many parts of Africa people living with elephants derive no benefits from that coexistence and only bear costs in terms of crop damage, injury or death,” Blanc said in a telephone interview from his Nairobi base. \n",
      "TROPICAL, LAND-LOCKED \n",
      "Many of these countries - such as Central African Republic - also suffer from the development curses of having tropical climates, which impose the heavy disease burden seen in their infant mortality rates, and being landlocked, which imposes economic costs. \n",
      "Still, that does not mean that wildlife in such places could not be utilized in a way that might bring economic benefits. Heavily forested and tropical Gabon, for example, is building a wildlife tourist industry aimed at the more adventurous. \n",
      "But elsewhere in central Africa, elephants, a natural resource that could lift rural economies in the form of eco-tourism, or even a regulated ivory trade down the road, are being exterminated, depriving future generations of potential income. \n",
      "Such poverty traps serve as a sobering reminder, against the backdrop of the “Africa Rising” narrative, that much of the world’s poorest continent is still being excluded from the region’s dynamic economic growth and investment story. \n",

      "By Wayne Cole \n",
      "SYDNEY, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Asian share markets endured mixed fortunes on Thursday in the wake of disappointing data on Chinese manufacturing, while investors showed renewed appetite for commodities as the new year got underway. \n",
      "Gold grabbed the limelight with a 1.5 percent jump to $1,223.46 an ounce, recouping just a little of the losses that made last year its worst in three decades. \n",
      "The buying spilled over into silver and copper, with dealers talking of Chinese demand for commodities in general. \n",
      "The other action was in the yen, which resumed its long decline as investors used it to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets abroad. \n",
      "The drop in the yen has been viewed as positive for Japanese exports and corporate earnings, and a major reason its share markets outperformed all others last year. \n",
      "Japan’s Nikkei was closed on Thursday but ended 2013 with an annual gain of 57 percent. Many analysts look for a further advance this year as the Bank of Japan remains committed to its massive stimulus campaign. \n",
      "Nomura’s global strategy team is forecasting that Japanese equities will provide the greatest return of all global stocks in 2014, thanks in large part to rising corporate earnings. \n",
      "They see the Nikkei at 18,000 points by the end of this year, up from the current 16,291, and said even 25,000 was possible by 2018 should Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s aggressive economic program prove successful in defeating deflation. \n",
      "Asian markets outside of Japan had a much more mixed performance in 2013, partly because investors rediscovered the attractions of assets in Europe and the United States. \n",

      "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Veteran technology journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher have unveiled “Re/code,” a technology news site and conference business to succeed AllThingsD which they founded and built into a premier tech media brand within News Corp. \n",
      "Mossberg and Swisher, who agreed in September to sever a 10-year relationship with News Corp, said on Thursday their new venture will be backed by Comcast’s NBCUniversal and Windsor Media, the investment company headed by former Yahoo! Inc Chief Executive Terry Semel. \n",
      "Mossberg and Swisher will hold majority ownership in the venture, with NBCUniversal and Windsor Media sharing a minority stake. \n",
      "“It says a lot about NBC in particular that a big media company would take a small share of a startup, provide plenty of funding without trying to control it,” Mossberg said by phone. “In order to grow, we needed a fully independent structure.” \n",
      "Mossberg declined to discuss financial details of the deal or the valuation of his new company, but said Re/code will share editorial resources with NBCUniversal. \n",
      "Re/code’s journalists, which include many former AllThingsD staff, will appear on programs such as CNBC and NBC News, while sites such as msnbc.com will run their work. Re/code will also partner with CNBC to host conferences. \n",
      "Both long-time Wall Street Journal reporters, Swisher and Mossberg founded AllThingsD in 2003 as an annual technology industry gathering. \n",
      "The blog launched in 2007 and in 2007 News Corp acquired Dow Jones, and with it the profitable AllThingsD. With the dissolution of AllThingsD’s relationship with News Corp, the site will remain online but the brand will be phased out. \n",
      "In the absence of AllThingsD - and with the introduction of a new competitor - the Journal has announced a new technology section complete with gadget reviews (formerly written by Mossberg) and beefed-up coverage from its San Francisco and bureaus in Asia and Israel. \n",
      "But neither the Journal nor Re/code will inherit the crown jewel of the AllThingsD brand - the lucrative annual conferences that regularly drew names like Steve Jobs, the late Apple Inc chief executive. \n",
      "The Journal said it would begin hosting its own tech conference called WSJD in late October in southern California. \n",
      "Mossberg said the same team that produced the AllThingsD conference will produce a rebranded event called the “Code Conference” during the same week and at the same hotel. \n",
      "Re/code is just one of several new arrivals in the crowded tech media arena. \n",
      "Earlier this year, Jessica Lessin, another Wall Street Journal reporter, also defected to launch The Information, a premium, subscription-based tech news site. Yahoo is also preparing a consumer tech site with David Pogue, the former New York Times gadget reviewer. \n",
      "“Tech sites and tech conferences are areas that people think are in demand and can be both journalistically valuable and financially successful,” Mossberg said. “We’re obviously hoping the same.” \n",

      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Sharpshooters will renew culling the white-tailed deer population, growing fast in the heart of the U.S. capital, as early as Thursday night, the National Park Service said. \n",
      "The nighttime hunts by Department of Agriculture shooters in Washington’s Rock Creek Park will continue until March 31, or until 106 deer have been killed, said Nick Bartolomeo, the park’s chief of resources management. \n",
      "The general public should remain out of harm’s way because joggers and cyclists are generally barred from the park after dark, according to the park service. \n",
      "The sharpshooters will deploy on unspecified nights as early as Thursday, when the 12-mile-long (19-km-long) park is normally closed. Park roads will also be temporarily closed as a safety precaution. \n",
      "The three-year program is aimed at reducing the deer population to 15 to 20 per square mile (six to eight per square km) from 77 per square mile (31 per square km), Bartolomeo said during a conference call with reporters. \n",
      "The first cull took place in March 2013, when 20 deer were killed in one night, he said. \n",
      "The number of deer has soared in the last 20 years, with the animals eating nearly all the park’s tree seedlings and preventing the forest from growing, according to a statement from the Park Service. \n",
      "“There are no historic records of a white-tailed deer population in Rock Creek Park before 1960,” said Park Superintendent Tara Morrison. \n",
      "The deer meat will be donated to food banks and  organizations for the homeless. \n",
      "The number of U.S. white-tailed deer has exploded from a few hundred thousand in the 1930s to an estimated 30 million presently. The growth has been blamed on a lack of predators and growth of deer-friendly residential areas outside cities.     (Reporting by Lacey Johnson; Editing by Ian Simpson and Gunna Dickson)\n",

      "Oregon pulls out OT win over Utah \n",
      "SALT LAKE CITY — Oregon finally found an opponent it couldn’t overwhelm with a flurry of points. So the Ducks turned to a timely defensive play to keep their unbeaten season going. \n",
      "Oregon guard Damyean Dotson latched onto a tipped pass by Utah center Dallin Bachynski in the waning seconds of overtime and raced untouched for a breakaway dunk with one second left. His basket helped 10th-ranked Oregon escape with a 70-68 victory in the Pac-12 opener for both teams on Thursday night. \n",
      "“That was unbelievable,” Dotson said, finishing with 11 points. “I never had a game winner like that before. It’s the greatest feeling for me. That’s a great way to start conference feeling.” \n",
      "Forward Richard Amardi had 14 points and guard Dominic Artis added 12 for the Ducks (13-0, 1-0), who matched their best start since winning 13 straight games to open the 2006-07 season. \n",
      "Forward Jordan Loveridge scored 21 points for Utah, guard Delon Wright chipped in with 14 and Bachynski added 11 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. \n",
      "The Utes (11-2, 0-1 Pac-12) led by as much as 10 points in the second half but could not overcome the last-second turnover by Bachynski. \n",
      "“We know we can play and compete with everyone in the league,” Loveridge said. “Hopefully next time we can make the plays down the stretch. The guys that have been here the last few years understand what we need to do moving forward. It hurts of course but we can’t sit back and think about it.” \n",
      "Utah was in position to win after Wright put the Utes ahead 68-66 with back-to-back baskets. But Dotson made two free throws to tie it in the final minute and then came up with the steal and winning basket in the final seconds. \n",
      "Loveridge got off a 3-pointer before the buzzer, but it bounced off the rim. \n",
      "Neither team shot well despite both teams ranking in the top five nationally in field-goal percentage. Oregon shot just 38.7 percent (24-of-62) from the floor. Utah shot just 38.1 percent (24-of-63) on the other end and 15.8 percent (3-of-19) from distance. \n",
      "“Nobody got a rhythm to their offense,” Oregon coach Dana Altman said. “They’re a good offensive team. I like to think we are. Neither team had a very good rhythm and missed some open shots. I don’t know if it was tight because it was the first conference game. I don’t know what it was. But there wasn’t much flow offensively to the game.” \n",
      "Utah duplicated its strong defensive start in the second half and threatened to put Oregon away. The Utes built a 10-point lead at 45-35 when guard Dakarai Tucker drained a 3-pointer with 13:45 left. \n",
      "That advantage did not last long. Oregon erased the deficit behind a 12-2 spurt ignited by a layup from forward Elgin Cook. The Ducks tied the score on another Cook layup and took a 51-49 lead on a tip-in basket from Amardi with 7:32 left. \n",
      "The Ducks constructed a three-point lead at 58-55 on guard Johnathan Loyd’s layup with 3:46 remaining. But Utah stayed within striking distance. Wright made a layup and two free throws to tie it at 60. The Utes briefly retook the lead at 62-60 when guard Brandon Taylor made two free throws with 42.4 seconds left. \n",
      "Dotson answered by making two free throws on the other end with 27.5 seconds left. Utah had a chance to win it on a 3-point shot by Loveridge at the end of regulation, but he could not get it to go as time expired. \n",
      "“We got a little loose with the ball and didn’t have that same intensity,” Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak said. “I think it was surprising to our guys to see them continue to run with us.” \n",
      "Utah used smothering defense to take control of the game in the opening minutes. The Utes made multiple hustle plays to force Oregon into turnovers and hurried shots. It helped Utah rip off 10 straight points after the Ducks scored the game’s first basket. \n",
      "Utah led by eight points after Taylor drained a 3-pointer to make it 13-5 with 13:03 remaining in the first half. \n",
      "Oregon got back on track behind several big baskets from Artis. His first 3-pointer helped the Ducks slice the deficit to three at 15-12. Then Artis drove for a layup to cut the margin to one at 17-16. \n",
      "Oregon tied the score three times before halftime — the final time on a jumper from Amardi with 2:12 left in the half. Utah retook a 28-26 lead when Bachynski made a jumper on the next possession. \n",
      "The Utes scored on three straight possessions — capped by Wright’s steal and resulting layup — to take a 32-26 lead with 43 seconds left before halftime. \n",
      "NOTES: Oregon shot just 37 percent (10-of-27) from the field before halftime. The Ducks entered Pac-12 play ranked fourth nationally in field goal percentage. ... Both teams have enjoyed their strongest starts in a while. Utah has its best record since starting 18-0 in the 1997-98 season. Oregon had its best start since opening the 2006-07 season at 13-0. ... Entering Thursday’s action, Utah F Jordan Loveridge ranked third in the Pac-12 in rebounding (9.4) and ninth in scoring (17.3).\n",

      "TORONTO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - An index measuring the pace of growth in Canada’s manufacturing sector pulled back to a four-month low in December as the rate of new orders and employment cooled, data showed on Thursday. \n",
      "The RBC Canadian Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, fell to a seasonally adjusted 53.5 last month from 55.3 in November. \n",
      "A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector. Manufacturing activity has been expanding for nine months in a row. It hit a 2-1/2-year peak in October. \n",
      "The forward-looking new orders component slipped to 55 from 58, while the employment measure dipped to 51.6 from 52.8. \n",
      "Investors will get a broader look at the labor market with the monthly unemployment report due next week. \n",
      "Still, the manufacturing sector should gain momentum in 2014, said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at RBC. \n",
      "“Our outlook for 2014 is underpinned by the assumption that Canadian exports will firm as the U.S. continues on a path of recovery - this will provide a healthier environment for manufacturing to further grow in the new year,” Ferley said in a statement. \n",
      "Input costs rose to the highest level in nine months, with the index climbing to 56 from 53.6. Companies reported higher fuel and raw materials prices, as well as unfavorable exchange rates that pushed up the costs of imports.\n",

      "Relapse of cured HIV patients spurs AIDS science on\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "* AIDS researchers learn lessons from relapse of Boston men \n",
      "* Setback underlines need for sensitive tests for hidden HIV \n",
      "* Experts say two-pronged approach must be way forward \n",
      "By Kate Kelland, Health and Science Correspondent \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Scientists seeking a cure for AIDS say they have been inspired, not crushed, by a major setback in which two HIV positive patients believed to have been cured found the virus re-invading their bodies once more. \n",
      "True, the news hit hard last month that the so-called “Boston patients” - two men who received bone marrow transplants that appeared to rid them completely of the AIDS-causing virus - had relapsed and gone back onto antiretroviral treatment. \n",
      "But experts say the disappointment could lay the basis for important leaps forward in the search for a cure. \n",
      "“It’s a setback for the patients, of course, but an advance for the field because the field has now gained a lot more knowledge,” said Steven Deeks, a professor and HIV expert at the University of California, San Francisco. \n",
      "He and other experts say the primary practical message is that current tests designed to detect even very low levels of HIV present in the body are simply not sensitive enough. \n",
      "As well as having the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the Boston patients both also had a type of blood cancer called lymphoma, for which they were treated using bone marrow transplants - one man in 2008 and the other in 2010. \n",
      "They continued taking the antiretroviral AIDS drugs, but eight months after each patient’s transplant, doctors found they could not detect any sign of HIV in their blood. \n",
      "In the early part of 2013, both patients decided to stop taking their AIDS drugs and both appeared to remain HIV-free - prompting their doctors, Timothy Henrich and Daniel Kuritzkes from Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, to announce at a conference in July that they may have been cured. \n",
      "Yet in December came news that one of the men had begun to show signs of an HIV rebound by August, while the second patient had a relapse in November. \n",
      "Henrich said the virus’ comeback underlined how ingenious HIV can be in finding hiding places in the body to evade attack efforts by the immune system and by drug treatment. \n",
      "“Through this research we have discovered the HIV reservoir is deeper and more persistent than previously known and that our current standards of probing for HIV may not be sufficient,” he said, adding that both patients were “currently in good health” and back on antiretroviral therapy. \n",
      "Barely a decade ago, few HIV scientists would have dared put the words HIV and cure in the same sentence. Yet some intriguing and inspiring cases in recent years mean many now believe it is just a question of time before a cure is found. \n",
      "First was the now famous case of Timothy Ray Brown, the so-called “Berlin patient,” whose HIV was eradicated by a complex treatment for leukaemia in 2007 involving the destruction of his immune system and a stem cell transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection. \n",
      "Such an elaborate, expensive and life-threatening procedure could never be used as a broad-spectrum approach for the world’s 34 million HIV patients. But the results in Brown focussed scientific attention on a genetic mutation known as ‘CCR5 delta 32’ as a target for possible gene therapy treatment. \n",
      "Then last March, French scientists who followed 14 HIV-positive people known as the “Visconti patients”, who were treated very swiftly with HIV drugs but then stopped treatment, said that even after seven years off therapy, they were still showing no signs of the virus rebounding. \n",
      "That announcement came only weeks after news of the “functional cure” of an HIV-positive baby in Mississippi who received antiretroviral treatment for 18 months from the day she was born. By the time she was two this appeared to have stopped the virus replicating and spreading. \n",
      "A “functional cure” is when HIV is reduced to such low levels that it is kept at bay even without treatment, though the virus can still be detected in the body. \n",
      "Sharon Lewin, an HIV expert at Monash University in Australia, said all these developments, as well as the setback suffered by the Boston patients, inspired scientists to investigate many different approaches in the search for a cure. \n",
      "“We’ve learnt many things here - and one of the most important is that a tiny, tiny amount of virus can get the whole thing going again,” she told Reuters. “It’s a clear message that we need better ways to pick up the virus.” \n",
      "Scientists are now more convinced than ever that a two-pronged approach which aims to firmly suppress the virus while bolstering the immune system provides the best way forward. \n",
      "“We need to attack in two ways - reduce the virus to very low levels and also to boost the immune response. We can’t do one without the other,” said Lewin. \n",
      "“So we still have to think of other creative ways to control HIV. And it’s still early days... before we can say which approach is likely to be the winner.”       (Reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Gareth Jones)\n",

      "Colonel Mamadou Ndala, who helped to secure the military defeat of the powerful M23 rebel movement in November, died of his wounds after a rocket attack on his vehicle near the village of Mavivi in North Kivu province. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The first major winter storm of 2014 bore down on the northeastern United States on Thursday, packing heavy snow, Arctic temperatures and strong winds for returning holiday travelers, forecasters said. \n",
      "The double-barreled storm system stretching from the lower Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic coast could dump more than 12 inches (30.5 cm) of snow in some areas, especially southern New England, by Friday morning, the National Weather Service said. \n",
      "“Heavy snow, strong winds, frigid temperatures and dangerous wind chills are in forecast for much of the region,” it said in a statement. \n",
      "The storm is expected to snarl traffic on the I-95 highway corridor between New York and Boston, the weather service said. At the southern edge of the storm, Washington is expected to receive less than one inch (2.5 cm) of snow. \n",
      "The powerful storm forced about 1,000 U.S. flights to be canceled and about 250 delayed, with the worst-affected airport Chicago’s O’Hare International, according to FlightAware, a website which tracks air travel. \n",
      "More than 94 million people were estimated to be traveling during the holiday season through Jan. 1, the automotive group AAA said, although many people may not be planning to head home until later this week or over the weekend. \n",
      "In Boston, public schools were told to close on Friday, extending students’ holiday break by a day. \n",
      "“What a New Year’s gift, to receive one last snowstorm as mayor,” said Mayor Thomas Menino, whose 20-year run as the city’s top executive will end on Monday. \n",
      "The storm will provide an early challenge to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio even as he tries to enact a progressive agenda. Problems from digging out from snowstorms have been political havoc for mayors in the United States’ biggest city for decades. \n",
      "The weather service said the mass of Arctic air would drop temperatures from 20 to 30 degrees below normal, with record lows possible on Friday. \n",
      "The low temperature in the contiguous United States on Wednesday was -43 Fahrenheit (-42 Celsius) at Embarrass, Minnesota, the weather service said. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Security Agency is trying to develop a computer that could ultimately break most encryption programs, whether they are used to protect other nations’ spying programs or consumers’ bank accounts, The Washington Post reported on Thursday. \n",
      "The report, which the newspaper said was based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, comes amid continuing controversy over the spy agency’s program to collect the phone records Internet communications of private citizens. \n",
      "In its report on Thursday, The Washington Post said that the NSA is trying to develop a so-called “quantum computer” that could be used to break encryption codes used to cloak sensitive information. \n",
      "Such a computer, which would be able to perform several calculations at once instead of in a single stream, could take years to develop, the newspaper said. In addition to being able to break through the cloaks meant to protect private data, such a computer would have implications for such fields as medicine, the newspaper reported. \n",
      "The research is part of a $79.7 million research program called “Penetrating Hard Targets,” the newspaper said. Other, non-governmental researchers are also trying to develop quantum computers, and it is not clear whether the NSA program lags the private efforts or is ahead of them. \n",
      "Snowden, living in Russia with temporary asylum, last year leaked documents he collected while working for the NSA. The United States has charged him with espionage, and more charges could follow. \n",
      "His disclosures have sparked a debate over how much leeway to give the U.S. government in gathering information to protect Americans from terrorism, and have prompted numerous lawsuits. \n",
      "Last week, a federal judge ruled that the NSA’s collection of phone call records is lawful, while another judge earlier in December questioned the program’s constitutionality. The issue is now more likely to move before the U.S. Supreme Court. \n",
      "On Thursday, the editorial board of the New York Times said that the U.S. government should grant Snowden clemency or a plea bargain, given the public value of revelations over the National Security Agency’s vast spying programs.

      "Altogether debt sales fell 15.1 percent to $311.8 billion from the prior year, as rising interest rates brought the refunding trend to a grinding halt. Preliminary Thomson Reuters data released last week had estimated total issuance for the year at $311.7 billion. \n",

      "SHANGHAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Chinese military will establish a joint operational command over its military forces to improve coordination between different parts of the country’s increasingly sophisticated military system, the official China Daily reported on Friday citing the Ministry of Defense. \n",
      "China has been moving rapidly to upgrade its military hardware, but military analysts say operational integration of complex and disparate systems across a regionalised command structure is a major challenge for Beijing. \n",
      "In the past, regional level military commanders have enjoyed major latitude over their forces and branches of the military have remained highly independent of each other, making it difficult to exercise the centralised control necessary to use new weapons systems effectively in concert. \n",
      "The report quoted comments made to China Daily by the Ministry of National Defense saying that China will implement a joint command system “in due course” and that it has already launched pilot programmes to that effect. \n",
      "China currently has seven military regions traditionally focused around ground-based army units, but China’s changing security interests, over claims to potentially energy rich submarine reserves in the South China Sea, has highlighted its need to focus more on air and naval forces. \n",
      "China and Japan are engaged in an intensifying standoff over a set of uninhabited disputed islands, and the Japanese government appears to be ready to ramp up military spending and adjust its nominally pacifist stance to a more confrontational one as the two militaries circle each other. \n",
      "China is also engaged in similar disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines. \n",
      "“China has built an iron bastion in its border regions. The major concern lies at sea,” said Li Qonggong, deputy secretary-general of the China Council for National Security Policy Studies, as quoted in the report.    (Reporting by Pete Sweeney; Editing by Michael Perry)\n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - European stocks were seen starting the first session of 2014 on a cautious note on Thursday, with many market players still on holiday and weak Chinese data casting a shadow over sentiment after what was the best year for equities since 2009. \n",
      "China’s factory activity slowed in December, official and private manufacturing surveys showed, raising concern about the strength of demand in the world’s second biggest economy. \n",
      "Equivalent numbers for Europe and the United States were also due later in the session, while the corporate calendar was set to remain quiet until next week. \n",
      "The FTSEurofirst 300 share index rallied 16.1 percent in 2013, its best showing in four years, bolstered by ample liquidity from global central banks and nascent signs of an economic recovery in Europe. The index closed at 1,316.39 points on Dec. 31, around five-year highs. \n",
      "Analysts are also upbeat on European equities in 2014, but most expect the returns to moderate. \n",
      "Although most European cash equity markets were due to reopen on Thursday, the Eurex exchange was shut, with no trading in futures on EuroSTOXX 50 and other key euro zone indexes. Financial spreadbetters at IG called for Britain’s FTSE 100 to open 6 points higher. \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending rose to its highest level in nearly five years in November as a surge in private construction  projects offset a drop in public outlays. \n",
      "Construction spending increased 1 percent to an annual rate of $934.4 billion, the highest level since March 2009, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. It was the eighth straight month that construction spending increased. \n",
      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected a gain of 0.6 percent in November. Construction spending in October was revised to show a 0.9 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent increase. \n",
      "The report added to data ranging from employment to consumer spending that have suggested resilience in the economy even as growth is expected to step down from the third-quarter’s brisk 4.1 percent annual rate. \n",
      "Construction spending in November was lifted by a jump in private construction projects to their highest level since December 2008. Private construction spending rose 2.2 percent after being flat in October. \n",
      "The increase reflected strong gains in spending on both residential and nonresidential projects. Private residential spending hit its highest level since June 2008 and outlays on nonresidential structures, which include factories and gas pipelines, touched an 11-month high. \n",
      "Public construction spending fell 1.8 percent as both outlays on federal and state and local government projects declined.   (Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n",

      "Preview: Magic at Cavaliers\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "Standout guard Kyrie Irving is day-to-day with a left knee contusion as his Cleveland Cavaliers prepare to host the Orlando Magic on Thursday. Irving had told reporters he “felt something pop” in his knee Tuesday against Indiana, but an MRI taken Wednesday reportedly showed no major damage and he may be available as the Cavaliers try to snap a six-game losing streak. The Magic could be without 7-0 Nikola Vucevic, who sprained his left ankle in the loss to Golden State on Tuesday. \n",
      "Vucevic missed four games with an ankle injury in early December and the Magic dropped all of them while getting badly beaten on the boards. The Cavaliers breathed a collective sigh of relief after the news on Irving, who is averaging 22.2 points, 6.1 assists and scored 31 in the 109-100 win at Orlando on Dec. 13. Cleveland lost in overtime twice and by three at Boston in its last four outings. \n",
      "TV: 7 p.m. ET, FSN Florida (Orlando), FSN Ohio (Cleveland) \n",
      "ABOUT THE MAGIC (10-21): After encouraging victories over Detroit and Atlanta, the Magic struggled to their second-lowest scoring total of the season (81) against Golden State. “We know we’re better than that,” Magic forward Tobias Harris told the Orlando Sentinel. “It’s tough going out there and not playing to our potential.” Leading scorer Arron Afflalo had his six-game streak of 20-point outings snapped Tuesday, but averages 21.7 points while Vucevic is second (13.4) and paces the team in rebounds (11.1). \n",
      "ABOUT THE CAVALIERS (10-21): If Irving can’t go, the Cavaliers will need second-leading scorer Dion Waiters (14.8) to perform like he did when posting 16 points in the fourth quarter against Orlando last month. Forward Tristan Thompson has stepped up in the last 15 games, averaging 13.3 points and 10.3 rebounds, with five double-doubles. With Andrew Bynum suspended by the team, rookies Tyler Zeller and Anthony Bennett have combined for 22 points in the last two games and should get more playing time. \n",
      "1. Orlando rookie G Victor Oladipo averaged 15.5 points and 9.5 assists in the victories over Detroit and Atlanta. \n",
      "2. The Cavaliers have outscored their opponents off the bench in 25 of 31 games, averaging a little fewer than 40 points. \n",
      "3. Magic G Jameer Nelson has drained 34-of-84 from 3-point range (40.5 percent) over the last 13 games. \n",

      "\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "The Golden State Warriors will put their six-game winning streak on the line with their toughest test of a lengthy road trip at the Miami Heat on Thursday. The Warriors took the first two of a seven-game trip and are enjoying their longest winning streak in six years while thriving at the defensive end. Golden State will need to be at its best at that end against the Heat, who have won eight of nine and are returning home after a four-game trip. \n",
      "The Warriors do not get a lot of credit for their defense but are one of the best in the league at limiting opponents. “We’ve had moments where we weren’t as effective as we’d like to be,” coach Mark Jackson said. “But, when you look at the numbers, holding a team under 40 (percent shooting), that’s the 14th time all year. Only Indiana has done it 15 times. So, we’ve got to get some recognition as far as the way that these guys defend on a high level.” Miami will test that defense with a healthy LeBron James, who returned from a one-game absence due to a groin injury and put up 26 points and 10 assists in 40 minutes at Denver on Monday. \n",
      "TV: 7:30 p.m. ET, CSN Bay Area (Golden State), Sun Sports (Miami) \n",
      "ABOUT THE WARRIORS (20-13): Golden State has gotten some strong performances from Stephen Curry during its winning streak and leaned on the interior and the bench in a 94-81 victory in Orlando on Tuesday. Andrew Bogut and David Lee provide a matchup issue for the Heat, and the Warriors figure to use their advantage on the inside. “We need to bring the same intensity (against Miami),” Curry said. “We feel like if we play the way we are supposed to play, we can beat everybody in this league. That is the mindset that we have and it is nice to have everybody healthy and ready to go to finish out this road trip and keep the momentum that we have.” \n",
      "ABOUT THE HEAT (24-7): James returned but Dwyane Wade went down with back spasms against the Nuggets and is considered day-to-day. Miami has been cautious with Wade all season and the team is used to playing without the All-Star guard, especially if Chris Bosh can maintain his current level of play. The veteran forward was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week on Monday after putting up 22.3 points and eight rebounds in four games, and followed it up with 17 points on 8-of-12 shooting in Monday’s 97-94 triumph that closed out a 3-1 trip. \n",
      "1. The Warriors won their lone trip to the Heat last season 97-95 behind 27 points from Klay Thompson. \n",
      "2. Miami G Norris Cole (face) took a hard fall and left Monday’s game but is expected to play Thursday. \n",
      "3. Lee has gone three straight without a double-double after posting 10 in a row. \n",

      "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hollywood producers nominated slavery drama ‘12 Years a Slave,’ 1970s con-men caper ‘American Hustle’ and space thriller ‘Gravity’ along with seven other films on Thursday for the top Producers Guild Award, a key indicator of sentiment in the race for the best picture Oscar. \n",
      "The other films nominated for outstanding producer in a motion picture were Woody Allen’s tragic comedy ‘Blue Jasmine,’ Somali pirate thriller ‘Captain Phillips,’ AIDS activist drama ‘Dallas Buyers Club,’ quirky computer-age romance ‘Her,’ heartland comedy ‘Nebraska,’ Disney’s making of ‘Mary Poppins’ in ‘Saving Mr Banks,’ and Martin Scorsese’s tale of American greed ‘Wolf of Wall Street.’ \n",
      "Notable snubs included the Coen brothers’ portrayal of the 1960s folk scene ‘Inside Llewyn Davis’ and two films from awards season power player The Weinstein Co. - family dysfunction drama ‘August: Osage County’ and civil rights saga ‘Lee Daniels’ The Butler.’ \n",
      "The Producers Guild Awards will be handed out in a ceremony in Beverly Hills on January 19, six weeks before the March 2 Academy Awards. Oscar nominations will be announced on January 16. \n",
      "The top PGA award can give crucial momentum to a frontrunner. In the last six years, the PGA winner has gone on to win best picture at the Oscars, including last year’s Iran hostage drama ‘Argo’ from director, producer and actor Ben Affleck. \n",
      "In a highly competitive year for film, ‘American Hustle,’ ‘Gravity’ and ‘Her’ have garnered top critics groups awards. But the unflinching portrayal of pre-Civil War slavery from British director and producer Steve McQueen in ‘12 Years a Slave’ is also considered a best picture frontrunner and leads nominations for the January 12 Golden Globe awards alongside ‘American Hustle’ with seven nods a piece. \n",
      "Megan Ellison, the daughter of Silicon Valley billionaire and Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, is a double nominee this year for ‘American Hustle’ from Columbia Pictures and ‘Her’ from Warner Bros Pictures. \n",
      "The 27-year-old Ellison, through her production company Annapurna Pictures, has emerged as a notable force in Hollywood by backing recent successes like ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ and Western remake ‘True Grit.’ \n",
      "Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros., Sony Corp’s Columbia and Viacom Inc’s Paramount Pictures each had two nominees in the list of 10 motion pictures. \n",
      "In the animation category, the Producers Guild nominated five films for outstanding producer - ‘The Croods,’ ‘Despicable Me 2,’ ‘Epic,’ ‘Frozen’ and ‘Monsters University.’ \n",

      "Eller roofed a shot from the bottom of the right circle for a 5-4 lead and Pacioretty added his second goal into an empty net with 1:04 remaining for the Canadiens.

      "Benn converted a nifty cross-ice pass from Seguin 6:12 into the game and Pacioretty, who was named to the U.S. OIympic team on Wednesday, answered 4:48 later after reeling in a stretch pass from Subban.

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Former Pakistani military ruler Pervez Musharraf was taken to hospital with chest pains on Wednesday while on his way to face treason charges in a special court in the capital, Islamabad. \n",
      "It was the third time that Musharraf has failed to appear in court to face the charges. The first two times he cited security concerns. \n",
      "Musharraf, 70, seized power in a 1999 military coup when he was army chief. He later became president and ruled until 2008. \n",
      "The treason charges relate to his imposition of a state of emergency in 2007, when he was maneuvering to extend his rule in the face of growing opposition from the public and the judiciary. \n",
      "Musharraf’s lawyers say he does not recognize the jurisdiction of the court and accuses it of bias. \n",
      "A spokeswoman for Musharraf said he had been taken to a military hospital in the city of Rawalpindi, near Islamabad. \n",
      "The case is being closely watched for any impact on the relationship between Pakistan’s three power centers - the military, an increasingly assertive judiciary and the fledgling civilian government. \n",
      "There is concern that the trial of the former military leader could anger the army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half its history since independence in 1947. \n",
      "Musharraf recently told reporters the whole army supported him though the military leadership has given no indication that it might intervene in the trial. \n",
      "Judge Faisal Arab has said he did not wish to issue an arrest warrant for Musharraf, but may be forced to if he does not appear in court. \n",

      "British manufacturing growth eases slightly in December\n",

      "* New centre-left leader offers 3 proposals on electoral law \n",
      "* Says a deal possible within weeks \n",
      "* Says EU budget rules may be eased if Italy passes reforms \n",
      "By James Mackenzie \n",
      "ROME, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Italian centre-left leader Matteo Renzi called on Thursday for swift reform of an electoral system blamed for the country’s bouts of political deadlock and said he expected an agreement could be completed within weeks. \n",
      "Renzi is not in the government but as head of the Democratic Party, the biggest party in Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s left-right coalition, he will have a decisive role to play in shaping the agenda and has already called for quicker action on reforms. \n",
      "Earlier on Thursday, Renzi suggested that moves to fix the economy and political system might lead to an easing of European Union deficit limits that have forced austerity measures on a resentful Italian public already coping with a long recession. \n",
      "Electoral reform has been one of the thorniest issues facing the coalition, formed after an inconclusive election last year prevented any side from forming a government on its own. \n",
      "It has been seen as a vital requirement if Italy is to elect a government capable of taking clear choices and pushing through reforms but agreement has long been held up by party bickering. \n",
      "The current system, which has been overturned in part by the Constitutional Court, makes it difficult for any party to form a stable majority in the two houses of parliament. It also gives voters no say over their individual representatives, who are appointed to fixed electoral lists by party bosses. \n",
      "Renzi proposed three different models which he said could be the basis of discussion, adding that all three proposals would give voters a clear choice and do away with the need for parties to cobble together ad-hoc coalitions to form a government. \n",
      "“It has to be clear who has won on the day of the election. Whoever wins has to be in government for five years without any fudges or grand coalitions, and it has to possible to change governments,” he said at an event in Florence. \n",
      "“The cards are on the table. We can wrap it up in two weeks or a month if the will is there.” \n",
      "One model would divide the country into 118 constituencies each electing four to five deputies, with the largest party taking a premium of 15 percent. \n",
      "A second would be based on a reworked version of the previous electoral law, with three quarters of deputies elected directly and the remainder divided between the largest party, which would take a 15 percent winner’s bonus, and a 10 percent slice reserved for some smaller parties. \n",
      "Finally, a third version would include a French-style two round system with a run-off vote, along the lines of the model already used in mayoral elections in large Italian towns. \n",
      "Under Renzi’s proposals, the Senate would lose its status as a chamber with equal powers to the lower house and become an assembly for local politicians including regional presidents and the mayors of big towns and cities. \n",
      "Doubt over the status of the electoral law has dampened speculation over a possible early return to the polls and it was not clear how quickly the other parties would be willing to move or whether a change made new elections more or less likely. \n",
      "Angelino Alfano, head of the small centre-right group in Letta’s coalition, welcomed the proposals and said he favoured the two round system used in mayoral elections. \n",
      "“The structure is clear and it works. There’s not much need for more talking,” he said in comments which suggested that the coalition partners at least should be able to reach an accord. \n",
      "Silvio Berlusconi, head of the centre-right Forza Italia party which pulled out of Letta’s government last year and who has been pushing for an early election, welcomed the proposals “among which there is certainly a reasonable solution”. \n",
      "All parties have pressed for a reform of the electoral law for years but agreement has been blocked by fears that any change could favour an opposing party. However pressure for change has grown and Letta has promised a new law in time for the European parliamentary elections in May. \n",
      "Separately, Renzi said Italy could negotiate a relaxation of European Union deficit limits if it shows it is serious about effective reforms to its economy and political system. \n",
      "“If there’s a leadership with a vision, I can’t see a problem with passing the deficit ceiling, although we’d have to have a battle to change the rules,” he told the daily Fatto Quotidiano in an interview published on Thursday.\n",

      "LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing grew less quickly than expected in December but the sector still looks on track to notch up growth of more than 1 percent in the fourth quarter, according to a survey on Thursday. \n",
      "Keen for Britain’s economic recovery to reduce its reliance on consumer spending, policymakers have taken heart from a pick-up in factory output in recent months. \n",
      "The Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) eased to 57.3 last month from November’s three-year high of 58.1. That was below the 58.0 expected by analysts but still well above the 50 mark that signals expansion. \n",
      "The average PMI reading for the final three months of the year was the highest since the first quarter of 2011. \n",
      "“UK manufacturing’s strong upsurge continued at the end of 2013, with rates of growth in production and new orders still among the highest in the 22-year PMI survey history,” said Markit economist Paul Dobson. \n",
      "While manufacturing has yet to recover to pre-crisis output levels - unlike the service sector which has already surpassed them - Dobson said broad-based growth in the sector should keep the recovery on track going into 2014. \n",
      "A sub-index for new orders slipped to 60.4 in December from November’s 19-year high of 63.9, but it remained well above the historical average. \n",
      "December’s survey signaled an eighth successive monthly rise in manufacturing employment with the second-strongest rate of jobs growth in the past two-and-a-half years. \n",
      "Unemployment has fallen faster than the Bank of England expected, adding to doubts about how long its pledge to keep interest rates at a record low will last. \n",
      "Britain’s central bank has said it will only consider raising interest rates once unemployment has fallen to 7 percent. That level, which appeared distant when the bank announced its so-called “forward guidance” policy in August, is now fast approaching. \n",
      "Figures two weeks ago showed unemployment fell to 7.4 percent in the three months to October, down from 7.6 percent in the three months to September. \n",

      "Fiat FIA.MI> helped to support the market on Thursday, surging 15 percent after the Italian carmaker gained full control of Chrysler. \n",
      "Its shares traded in heavy volume of 1.7 times their 90-day average after the company tied up a deal to buy the remaining 41.46 percent of the American carmaker that it did not already own, after over a year of protracted talks. \n",
      "Italian investment firm Exor, Fiat’s majority stakeholder, rose 6 percent, and the two stocks were the  FTSEurofirst 300’s first and second top gainers. \n",
      "The pan-European index was flat at 1,316.32 after hitting fresh 5-1/2 year highs in early trade. The FTSEurofirst rallied 16.1 percent in 2013 in its best showing since 2009 thanks to ample liquidity from global central banks and early signs of an economic recovery in Europe. \n",
      "Sentiment remained supported by the strong gains enjoyed over 2013 and a 6.1 percent rally since the middle of December. \n",
      "A touch of caution to the new year’s trading was added by news that China’s factory activity slowed in December, raising concern about the strength of demand in the world’s second-biggest economy. \n",
      "However, market attention was on whether there was the conviction to push on and make fresh highs in what was expected to be a light trading session, with many investors yet to return to work after the Christmas and New Year holidays. \n",
      "“We’re looking to see a continuation from last year’s trend, rather than any focus on the data from China overnight,” David Madden, analyst at IG, said. \n",

      "Historically, equities have enjoyed gains in early January as investors put on fresh bets for the year ahead. A Reuters poll at the end of 2013 forecast a 12 percent gain for European stocks in the coming year. \n",
      "The first trading month of the year has been positive every month since 2010. \n",
      "“January is normally a very strong month, you always see very strong bids in the market this time of year,” said Peter Garnry, equity strategist at Saxo Bank. \n",
      "“It has been quite an incredible rally and at some point I think we will need to see a correction, but it probably won’t be in January.” \n",

      "Nets win in Oklahoma City on Johnson's final shot\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "Nets win in Oklahoma City on Johnson’s final shot \n",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY — Joe Johnson is no longer the scoring machine he used to be in his prime. The Brooklyn Nets guard is no longer asked to be. \n",
      "However, when the game is on the line, Johnson is the one the Nets call on to pull them through, which is what he did when he hit the winning shot in the Nets’ 95-93 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday night at Chesapeake Energy Arena. \n",
      "“He was getting the ball,” Nets coach Jason Kidd said. “We asked if he wanted the last shot. He delivered. We understand the personnel and Joe delivered.” \n",
      "The Thunder have now lost two consecutive games at home after having leads of at least 16 points. For a team that takes pride in protecting its home court ferociously, the outcome was unacceptable to them. \n",
      "“We have to do a better job definitely of protecting leads,” Thunder coach Scott Brooks said. “That’s the second game in a row that we didn’t do a good job of closing quarters and closing games out. That’s something we have to do a better job of, especially on our home floor.” \n",
      "The Nets used a 14-0 run to whittle the Thunder’s lead to 89-88. Guard Deron Williams gave Brooklyn a two-point advantage when he drilled a 3-pointer with two minutes left in the fourth quarter. \n",
      "Thunder forward Serge Ibaka turned the ball over and Williams followed with another midrange jumper. Oklahoma City forward Kevin Durant answered with a layup to close the gap to 93-91. \n",
      "The Thunder (25-7) got the ball with 13 seconds left. Durant tried to dribble around forward Kevin Garnett, then jumped in the air to make a pass. The ball was deflected but ended up in the hands of Ibaka, who drove in for a layup to tie the score with five seconds remaining. \n",
      "The Nets (11-21) called a timeout and Johnson told Kidd he wanted the ball. Kidd called his number. Johnson got the ball near the top of the key and drilled a jumper in Ibaka’s face at the buzzer. \n",
      "“I guess it was my turn,” Johnson said. “I just wanted to make sure we had the last shot. I didn’t even try and look at the goal until I came out of my move. That’s when I looked. In my head, the clock was going down. You kind of have a feel for it. Basically instincts.” \n",
      "Williams, who started at shooting guard, scored a game-high 29 points to go along with four assists and five steals. Forward Paul Pierce chipped in with 18 points on 6-for-18 shooting from the field for the Nets. Johnson had nine points and four rebounds. \n",
      "“The thing is we stayed together,” Pierce said. “Even through tough times, this team was sticking together, trying to find a way and use the new year as a resolution to turn things around.” \n",
      "Durant paced the Thunder with 24 points on 8-for-13 shooting from the field. He also racked up five turnovers to go with four rebounds and four assists. Ibaka added 10 points and 11 boards. \n",
      "The Thunder were outrebounded 34-33 and they committed 21 team turnovers, including 14 in the second half. \n",
      "“We’ve just got to do better,” Durant said. “It’s tough to swallow, losing at the buzzer like that after being up by so much.” \n",
      "NOTES: A Brooklyn beat writer asked Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks if it is reassuring to not have the same worries as the Nets because they are a small-market team. “I don’t look at ourselves as small market,” Brooks said. “I look at us as we’re one of 30 NBA great markets.” ... As Brooklyn coach Jason Kidd continues to search for answers to his team’s struggle, he changed his starting lineup. G Shaun Livingston was inserted into the rotation and F Mirza Teletovic went to the bench. “We are giving a new look,” Kidd said. “There’s nothing wrong with trying something new.” ... Brooks is concerned that G Reggie Jackson is averaging only 1.9 foul shots per game. “It’s the next part of his game, it’s to get to the free throw line,” Brooks said. “A lot of times he shoots it before the defense gets there. It’s a skill to get to the line. There are only a few guys that get there consistently every year.” ... G Russell Westbrook (knee) was in street clothes on the Thunder sideline for the first time since announcing he would be out until after the All-Star break. He was also walking without crutches for the first time.\n",

      "Thai stocks, currency plunge over election uncertainty\n",
      "\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai stocks and the baht currency tumbled on Thursday as uncertainty deepened about a February election that anti-government forces are determined to block in their bid to oust Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. \n",
      "The benchmark index dropped 2.7 percent to a four-month low of 1,263.72 before the midday break and the baht lost for a 10th straight day against the dollar. Investors are worried a February 2 poll will not go ahead, leaving Yingluck’s government exposed to prolonged attacks by opponents. \n",
      "National Security Council chief Paradorn Pattanatabut said on Thursday security agencies were considering declaring a state of emergency after protesters said they would try to “shut down” the capital from January 13. \n",
      "“The situation has intensified,” Paradorn told Reuters. “We may need to call for tougher measures and security agencies have planned for that.” \n",
      "The latest bout of political tumult erupted in November after a blunder by the ruling Puea Thai Party, which tried to push through an unpopular amnesty bill that would have annulled the jail sentence of Yingluck’s self-exiled brother and former premier, Thaksin Shinawatra, the divisive tycoon at the heart of eight years of on-off conflict. \n",
      "Protesters say Yingluck is a puppet of Dubai-based Thaksin, who they call a corrupt crony capitalist who has subverted a democratic system that needs to be suspended and overhauled. \n",
      "Backed by Bangkok’s conservative elite, their broader aim is to neutralize the power of Thaksin’s political juggernaut, rooted among the rural poor in the populous north and northeast, which has won every poll since 2001. \n",
      "Yingluck dissolved parliament on December 9 to defuse massive street protests. However, calling a new election she is almost certain to win has had the opposite effect, sparking deadly clashes, mysterious shootings and concerns about military intervention or legal paralysis. \n",
      "The crisis has hurt Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy, which is already suffering from weak spending and sluggish export growth. \n",
      "The baht slid to 32.91 per dollar on Thursday, its weakest since February 2010. The share selloff came after foreign investors offloaded $1.26 billion of Thai shares in December, compared with $6.2 billion for the whole year. \n",
      "Thailand’s Election Commission (EC) met on Thursday to try to find a solution to break the poll deadlock but, with Thais deeply polarized, that appears increasingly unlikely. \n",
      "The conflict is all too familiar in Thailand after eight years of upheaval characterized by violent street protests and blockades, as well as judicial and military intervention. \n",
      "Yingluck has spent much of the past two weeks in her northern strongholds but returned to Bangkok on Wednesday to join military leaders in paying a New Year goodwill visit to King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s top aide, Prem Tinsulanonda, a retired general in his 90s. \n",
      "Yingluck is clinging on, asserting her democratic mandate from an election landslide in 2011, but protesters backed by Bangkok’s royalist establishment, the opposition Democrat Party and old-money families are demanding she resigns to allow an appointed “people’s council” to take over. \n",
      "Thailand has been in a tense stalemate for weeks and the government is looking increasingly isolated. \n",
      "The mostly peaceful protests descended into chaos on December 26 when a hard core of demonstrators tried to invade an election registration centre. Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, while unknown gunmen killed a policeman and a demonstrator. Scores were wounded. \n",
      "The EC urged Yingluck to postpone the election after those clashes but was quickly rebuffed by the government, which said any delay would be unconstitutional. \n",
      "The next day, the country’s powerful army chief refused to rule out intervening to defuse the crisis, a marked shift from the usual denials by a coup-prone military. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "* Samsung Electronics extends fall on 4Q earnings fears \n",
      "* Foreign investors maintain position as net sellers \n",
      "SEOUL, Jan 3 (Reuters) - South Korean shares slipped close to a four-month low on Friday morning as investors braced for a grim corporate earnings outlook at big exporters like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, squeezed by the won’s strength. \n",
      "The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was down 1.2 percent at 1,943.67 points as of 0238 GMT, its lowest level since Sept. 5. \n",
      "Friday’s slide came the day after the index dropped 2.2 percent, its biggest one-day percentage fall since mid-July 2012, when the won climbed to its highest level against the dollar for about five years. \n",
      "That ascent has raised concern among some investors that bellwether electronics giant Samsung Electronics may fall short of consensus forecasts when it reports preliminary earnings for the fourth quarter on Jan. 7. \n",
      "Samsung Electronics slipped 0.9 percent on Friday following a 4.6 percent drop on Thursday, its worst daily percentage fall in almost six months. \n",
      "“Fourth-quarter earnings tend to turn out weaker-than-expected due to one-off special bonus payments,” said Lim Dong-rak, a market analyst at Hanyang Securities. “But for a symbolic company like Samsung Electronics to be involved in speculation of missing initial consensus by wide margin scares off investors, as it also points to a possible downward adjustment in this year’s forecast.” \n",
      "The company is forecast to report a record 10.3 trillion won ($9.8 billion) operating profit for the October-December quarter, according to an average of 40 analysts’ estimates compiled by the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts at local brokerages say operating profit could be in the mid-9 trillion won range. \n",
      "While the won did weaken slightly against the greenback  and the yen on Friday morning, South Korea’s Finance minister said the country is closely monitoring market volatility. \n",
      "That weakening of the currency also helped Hyundai Motor Co  stabilise the day after currency concerns and a forecast of its lowest annual growth in car sales this year since 2003 squeezed the stock to its the biggest daily percentage drop since July 12. The stock was broadly unchanged Friday. \n",
      "Shipbuilding and banking shares also weighed on the benchmark index. Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co Ltd and KB Financial Group Inc dropped 4.2 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. \n",
      "Foreign investors maintained their selling stance, offloading a net 82.2 billion won ($78.26 million) worth of KOSPI shares near mid-session. ($1 = 1050.3000 Korean won) \n",

      "Preview: Hurricanes at Capitals\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "The Carolina Hurricanes face plenty of roster uncertainty as they ring in their new year Thursday with a game against the Capitals in Washington. Trade rumors continue to swirl around the Hurricanes, who are running out of time to make headway in the Eastern Conference standings. The Hurricanes defeated the Montreal Canadiens 5-4 in overtime on Tuesday for their second win in 10 games, while Washington is coming off a 3-1 loss to Ottawa. \n",
      "While the Hurricanes began their roster shakeup Wednesday by sending defenseman Tim Gleason to Toronto, the Capitals - and captain Alex Ovechkin in particular - are having their own struggles. Washington has dropped back-to-back games and is looking for any kind of production from Ovechkin, who hasn’t scored in a season-high four straight contests. The Capitals’ power play led the league as recently as Monday but has slipped to second overall as it finds itself mired in a 2-for-14 slump. \n",
      "TV: 7 p.m. ET, FSN (Carolina), CSN (Washington) \n",
      "ABOUT THE HURRICANES (15-16-9): Prior to the Winter Classic, Carolina traded Gleason to the Maple Leafs for fellow defenseman John-Michael Liles and Dennis Robertson. The 30-year-old Gleason was having a subpar season in Carolina, registering one assist and a minus-10 rating in 17 games. Blue-liner Justin Faulk was named to the United States Olympic Team prior to the Winter Classic. \n",
      "ABOUT THE CAPITALS (20-15-5): Washington has benefited from the draft more than just about any team not residing in Pittsburgh or Chicago over the last 10 years, and two of their best picks have excelled as a defensive pairing. U.S. Olympian John Carlson and Karl Alzner lead the team in ice time and often are matched up against the opposing team’s best line. “It’s a lot of fun,” Alzner told the Washington Post. “The games when you do good and shut them down is pretty rewarding.” \n",
      "1. The teams split their previous four meetings, with Washington prevailing 4-2 in their last encounter on Dec. 21. \n",
      "2. Ovechkin has 26 goals and 43 assists in 55 games versus the Hurricanes. The assist total is the highest of any opponent. \n",
      "3. Carlson averages 24 minutes and 41 seconds of ice time, while Alzner is at 21:20. \n",

      "The San Jose Sharks attempt to extend their home point streak to 11 games when they host the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday. San Jose improved to 9-0-1 at the SAP Center when they posted a 3-1 triumph over Anaheim on Sunday. The Sharks had their four-game overall winning streak snapped two days later, however, as they dropped a 6-3 decision at Anaheim in the back end of the home-and-home series. \n",
      "Edmonton is coming off a 4-3 overtime loss at Phoenix on Tuesday in which it allowed the game’s final three tallies. Taylor Hall collected three assists while David Perron scored a goal and set up another. Despite squandering a 3-1 lead, the Oilers extended their point streak to four games (2-0-2). \n",
      "TV: 10:30 p.m. ET, RSN West (Edmonton), CSN California (San Jose) \n",
      "ABOUT THE OILERS (13-24-5): Roman Horak made his debut with Edmonton on Tuesday after being recalled from Oklahoma City of the American Hockey League last week. The 22-year-old Czech, who was acquired from Calgary on Nov. 8 in the Ladislav Smid deal, appeared in one game with the Flames this season - also against Phoenix. Hall’s three-point performance Tuesday was his second in four games and his fourth multi-point effort in six contests. \n",
      "ABOUT THE SHARKS (25-9-6): Logan Couture appears to be heating up with goals in each of his last two contests following an 11-game drought. The 24-year-old is two assists shy of 100 for his career. San Jose has been getting unexpected production from 32-year-old left wing Bracken Kearns, who has tallied in two straight games after failing to score in his first seven NHL contests. Joe Pavelski again will represent the United States as the Wisconsin native was named to the Olympic Team for the second straight Winter Games. \n",
      "1. Sharks captain Joe Thornton notched his 826th career assist Tuesday, passing Alex Delvecchio for 25th place on the all-time list. He also moved within eight points of Bobby Hull (1,170) for 48th in NHL history. \n",
      "2. Edmonton RW Nail Yakupov was a healthy scratch Tuesday after registering only two goals in his last 18 games. \n",

      "Bulls C Noah narrowly misses triple-double in win \n",
      "CHICAGO — Not every NBA team will turn to its center when looking for better ball movement, but the Chicago Bulls are in a unique position. \n",
      "Center Joakim Noah barely missed a triple-double, finishing with 17 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists, while leading the Bulls to a 94-82 victory over the Boston Celtics on Thursday at the United Center. \n",
      "It was the second consecutive game in which Noah led the team in assists. He is averaging 3.6 assists on the season. \n",
      "“We have always run a lot of offense through (Noah), and that’s what makes us a little different,” coach Tom Thibodeau said. “He’s going to make you fight for body position, and that opens up the basket area and gets us into a cutting game. He’s very unselfish.” \n",
      "The Bulls tried to get Noah one more assist, but teammate Jimmy Butler missed a corner jumper off a pass from Noah with eight seconds left, as the fans groaned. \n",
      "Forward Carlos Boozer added 16 points for the Bulls, and forward Luol Deng scored 14. \n",
      "Chicago (13-18) won for the seventh time in its past eight home games against the Celtics (13-19). \n",
      "“I enjoy setting guys up, but it really depends on guys making their shots,” Noah said. “Everyone was telling me I was getting close (to the triple-double) and needed an assist. Yes, I was trying to get it. Jimmy tried to get it for me, but it’s really not the way you are supposed to do it.” \n",
      "Guard Jordan Crawford led the Celtics with 22 points. Center Jared Sullinger added 11 points and 11 assists for Boston, which lost for the fifth time in six games. \n",
      "“I am very encouraged, and the reason why is we played very physical,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “The Bulls are very physical, and they are very impressive. I think this is the best we’ve played in the last seven games.” \n",
      "The Bulls lost All-Star guard Derrick Rose to a knee injury on Nov. 22 and didn’t have the rest of their lineup healthy until Tuesday against the Toronto Raptors. Chicago scored 79 points that night, but they moved the ball much better against Boston, finishing with 26 assists. The Bulls have four wins in their past six games. \n",
      "The game went back and forth for most of the first three quarters. Boston closed within 66-62 with 1:12 left in the third quarter on forward Kris Humphries’ jumper. \n",
      "Chicago finished the quarter with a fast-break dunk by Butler off a steal by forward Mike Dunleavy. Then Dunleavy followed in a Boozer miss with 0.3 seconds remaining, giving the Bulls their biggest lead at 70-62. \n",
      "To start the fourth quarter, Noah finished a lay-in, then found Dunleavy on a cut for another lay-in and the lead was up to 12. When Dunleavy pulled up and drained a 3-pointer on the next possession, the Bulls’ lead reached 77-62. \n",
      "Midway through the fourth quarter, Chicago forward Taj Gibson fell on his right hip when fouled hard by Sullinger. After a few minutes on the ground, Gibson shook it off and kept playing, while Sullinger was given a grade-one flagrant foul. \n",
      "“I’m lucky,” Gibson said. “The basketball gods are on my side because it could have been worse. I fell on my wrist and my elbow.” \n",
      "The Bulls were hit with three technical fouls for complaining about calls. Coach Tom Thibodeau and Boozer were whistled in the first half, Dunleavy in the third quarter. \n",
      "NOTES: Boston sent G MarShon Brooks on a D-League assignment to Maine, where he was in the starting lineup for Thursday night’s game against Tulsa. Brooks played in just nine of the Celtics’ 31 games this season. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said the move was done mostly to get Brooks extended playing time. ... The game at the United Center marked a reunion between Boston assistant Ron Adams and the Bulls. Adams was a Chicago assistant for the previous four years and is one of Tom Thibodeau’s best friends in coaching. The Bulls chose not to renew Adams’ contract after last season. ... Stevens downplayed an argument between Celtics F Brandon Bass and F Jeff Green on the bench during Tuesday night’s loss to the Atlanta Hawks. “Anybody who has been on a team knows that those things happen,” Stevens said. ... Celtics G Rajon Rondo plans to follow the team on an upcoming West Coast trip and said he is close to returning from ACL surgery on his right knee. Rondo last played on Jan. 25, 2013.\n",

      "MILAN (Reuters) - Italian defense group Finmeccanica SIFI.MI said on Thursday its AgustaWestland unit welcomed India’s decision to take part in an arbitration process over a $770 million helicopter deal. \n",
      "“AgustaWestland... confirms having received yesterday from India’s Ministry of Defense notification concerning the appointment of an arbitrator from its side,” Finmeccanica said in a statement. \n",
      "India cancelled the chopper deal with AgustaWestland on Wednesday over what it termed a breach of integrity, but agreed to participate in an arbitration process. \n",
      "AgustaWestland did not believe the contract termination notice issued by the Indian Defense Ministry or the “show cause notice” provided an adequate basis for taking action against it, Finmeccanica said. \n",
      "But it said it remained committed to working with the Indian government to resolve the issues. \n",
      "“AgustaWestland is ready to take the necessary actions, on top of the above-mentioned arbitration measures, included in a mitigation plan already prepared,” it said. \n",
      "India froze payments for 12 AW101 helicopters after Finmeccanica’s then chief executive was arrested in February for allegedly paying bribes to secure the deal. \n",

      "Impact of presidential election on Brazil M&A; deal flow seen limited\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "SAO PAULO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions activity in Brazil is expected to accelerate early in 2014 despite risks from a presidential election and global market turmoil, with a weaker currency and cheaper valuations presenting opportunities to clinch deals. \n",
      "The presidential election in October could slow activity in the second half however, although private equity firms will keep scouring for favorable takeovers following a drop in the value of some firms in 2013, bankers said. \n",
      "Many investors expect political wrangling ahead of the election to further weigh on market confidence, which has already been rattled by the Brazilian government’s erratic policy decisions and mounting state meddling in the economy in recent years. \n",
      "But dealmakers are hopeful the noise won’t have too much of an impact on M&A; activity in Brazil. A pipeline with a significant number of transactions could materialize into done deals with the proper catalyst - which could be a quiet ballot, a weaker currency or faster growth. \n",
      "“2014 will be a challenging year but I see a solid deal pipeline waiting out there,” said Fabio Mourão, a managing director for investment banking at Credit Suisse Group in São Paulo. “Deals will only be concluded as long as market conditions permit, but prospects look good.” \n",
      "Deal making in Brazil got off to a slow start in 2013, with M&A; activity measured by the value of deals falling to the lowest reading in eight years in the first half of the year. But activity picked up after that as the government auctioned off a flurry of airport, toll road and oil field concessions, promising higher returns and ample credit for the ventures. \n",
      "In 2013, companies announced $74.43 billion worth of deals in Brazil, up about 5.7 percent from $70.40 billion a year earlier, according to a quarterly Thomson Reuters report on M&A; activity. However, that number is down from $80.59 billion in deals in 2011 and $164.29 billion in 2010. \n",
      "Still, when measured in terms of the number of deals, 2013 was not that favorable for M&A; bankers, the report showed. About 611 deals were announced last year, down from 823 in 2012. \n",
      "“A flagging economy, political uncertainty and poor operational performance of some companies played a negative influence on confidence, especially for strategic M&A; decisions,” said Pedro Costa, head of M&A; at Morgan Stanley & Co’s Brazilian unit. \n",
      "While year-on-year comparisons show mixed results, M&A; activity surged about 250 percent between the first and second half of last year as sellers sought less for their companies, while worries that the U.S. government would taper off years of economic stimulus subsided. \n",
      "Grupo BTG Pactual SA led Brazil’s M&A; rankings in 2013 as Chief Executive André Esteves’s focus on advising fast-growing segments translated into almost $22 billion of deals in the October-December period alone, the report showed. \n",
      "BTG Pactual, Latin America’s largest independent investment bank, advised on $34.547 billion worth of deals last year, more than twice the $15.9 billion of transactions in 2012. In terms of the number of deals, BTG Pactual worked on 51 transactions in 2013, compared with 73 in 2012. These included Grupo Oi SA’s  planned takeover of Portugal Telecom SGPS. \n",
      "Marco Gonçalves, BTG Pactual’s head of M&A;, said the first half of this year “will be pretty good for business, but election-related uncertainty might cool things a bit.” \n",
      "In 2014, BTG Pactual expects to advise on a number of M&A; deals “similar or slightly above” the 2013 tally, Gonçalves said. Deal values may suffer if large transactions fail to materialize, he added. \n",
      "The M&A; advisory business in Brazil has suffered in recent years as state intervention in the economy weighed on market sentiment and fears of a U.S. Federal Reserve-led tightening of global monetary policy sparked market volatility. \n",
      "But in recent months, signs of a more business-friendly economic policy framework emboldened investment banks, which depend on merger advisory services for about half their revenue in Brazil. President Dilma Rousseff’s push to woo investment in infrastructure is fanning optimism that interference will wane, bankers said. \n",
      "Banks may remain cautious, however, even if there is a sharp recovery in advisory work in 2014. Staff and capital levels are seen as adequate, meaning that any pick-up in work is unlikely to lead to massive hiring, or more capital being deployed into operations. \n",
      "Indeed, market noise during the election could pose a hurdle to deals, bankers said. \n",
      "Brazilians elect a new president, federal and state lawmakers and 27 governors in October. While early polls show Rousseff as a clear favorite for re-election, opposition candidates could gain ground if economic growth falters or inflation accelerates further, analysts say. \n",
      "Corporate takeovers in the consumer goods and services and infrastructure sectors are likely to remain the main driver for activity this year, said Hans Lin, co-head of investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in São Paulo. \n",
      "Jean-Marc Etlin, senior vice president for investment banking at Itaú BBA, expects private equity funds to seek more takeovers now that Brazil’s currency, the real, is near its lowest level in four years and may slip further in 2014. A weaker real makes it cheaper for dollar-funded buyout firms to buy assets in Brazil. \n",
      "Strategic buyers are now hesitant given the potential for local and global turmoil, he added, forcing bidders to design and execute their takeover strategies in “a more careful way.” \n",
      "Renato Ejnisman, head of investment banking at Bradesco BBI, said buyers will probably seek more exposure to Brazil based on their need to get a specific asset, and not because of the country’s status as an emerging market with growth potential. \n",
      "“M&A; bets will be directed bets, which will be more specific-asset-related than country-related,” he added.\n",

      "Bayer executive sees benefits of R&D; changes as early as 2016\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Bayer expects a campaign to accelerate the pace of new discoveries of ingredients for pharmaceuticals and pesticides to yield results as early as 2016, a management board member said. \n",
      "“We expect it to be reflected in our pipeline in the next two, three, four, five years,” Wolfgang Plischke, Bayer’s outgoing innovation chief, told Reuters in an interview. \n",
      "Under the project named Nimbus, announced in 2012, Bayer’s human and animal health businesses as well as its CropScience division are being tied together more closely and hundreds of Bayer researchers are encouraged to exchange information that could help in the discovery of new ingredients. \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing ended the year on a high note, growing in December at its fastest pace in 11 months, while the rate of job growth was the swiftest since March, an industry report showed on Thursday. \n",
      "Financial data firm Markit said its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 55.0 last month, beating November’s 54.7 reading and an initial December estimate of 54.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. \n",
      "A solid increase in output, for which the index rose to its highest mark in 21 months of 57.5 from 57.4 in November, boosted growth in the sector and increased demand for plants and machinery. \n",
      "“This tells us that business spending is picking up on the back of rising confidence, which adds to the sense that the recovery is (becoming) more self-sustaining,” said Markit chief economist Chris Williamson. \n",
      "The pace of hiring increased, with the employment sub-index rising to 54.0, its best showing in nine months, from 52.3 in November. Williamson said the index suggests manufacturing jobs are being created at a rate of about 20,000 per month. \n",
      "Signs of strength in both the manufacturing and services sector as well as stronger job growth across the economy contributed to the Federal Reserve’s decision in December to begin slowing its monthly bond purchases. That program, which the Fed began 15 months ago, was designed to keep long-term interest rates low and boost hiring and growth. \n",

      "UCF outscores Baylor in Fiesta Bowl shootout \n",
      "GLENDALE, Ariz. — Baylor found itself in an awkward position all week at the Fiesta Bowl as Bears coach Art Briles dodged rumors that he is a candidate to replace Mack Brown at Texas. \n",
      "Fifteenth-ranked Central Florida made sure the sixth-ranked Bears stayed uncomfortable on the field Wednesday night. \n",
      "The Knights surged to a two-touchdown lead early in the fourth quarter and held off Baylor 52-42 in the Fiesta Bowl at the University of Phoenix Stadium. \n",
      "UCF quarterback Blake Bortles passed for 301 yards, rushed for 93 and accounted for four touchdowns to upstage Baylor counterpart Bryce Petty. \n",
      "“He made big plays,” UCF coach George O’Leary said of Bortles. “He made plays with his legs and found a way to make some plays that could’ve been bad plays into good ones.” \n",
      "After Baylor tied the game 28-28 early in the third quarter, Bortles directed a nine-play, 76-yard touchdown drive that he capped with a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Breshad Perriman. \n",
      "Three plays into the fourth quarter, Bortles ran 15 yards for a touchdown to re-establish the Knights’ 14-point advantage. \n",
      "Bortles looked back during the touchdown run and was surprised to find he was by himself. \n",
      "“We knew it was there,” Bortles said. “The safety came down and I bounced out, and I guess he fell down. I looked back and didn’t see him. Our guys just did a great job of blocking that play up.” \n",
      "Bortles completed 20 of 31 passes and threw two interceptions. \n",
      "UCF (12-1) forced Baylor into an unfamiliar position. The Bears (11-2) trailed only once in the second half previously this season, and they lost that game at Oklahoma State. Petty kept firing, and he finished 30-for-47 for 356 passing yards with two touchdown passes and one interception. \n",
      "However, Baylor was held back by 17 penalties for 135 yards. \n",
      "“I’m disappointed in myself,” Briles said. “I don’t think I did a good job of preparing our team. I can’t remember the last time we had this many penalties.” \n",
      "UCF running back Storm Johnson helped close out Baylor with a 40-yard touchdown run with 10:26 left in the fourth quarter. Johnson rushed for 124 yards and three touchdowns on 20 attempts. \n",
      "Johnson put the Knights in command from the start, capping the first two drives with touchdown runs. \n",
      "“The line did an awesome job of opening holes and creating space for me to run through,” Johnson said. \n",
      "By defeating Baylor, UCF moved to 2-0 this season against teams ranked in the top 10. The Knights also beat then-No. 8 Louisville 38-35, handing the Cardinals their only loss of the season. UCF’s only loss came against then-No. 12 South Carolina. \n",
      "O’Leary bristled in the postage press conference at a question regarding UCF’s legitimacy as a program. \n",
      "“Any time you win 12 games in a season, it’s great for your program,” O’Leary said. “A win like this is great. It’s national exposure. It’s great for the players. It’s great for the school.” \n",
      "UCF dominated the line of scrimmage early to take a 14-0 lead midway through the first quarter. \n",
      "Johnson, who rushed for 59 yards in the first quarter, scored on runs of 11 and 2 yards on the Knights’ first two drives. UCF ran on 10 of 11 plays on the two marches to take the initial momentum. \n",
      "Baylor climbed back by creating turnovers. \n",
      "Bears cornerback Demetri Goodson intercepted a long Bortles pass at the Baylor 3 to stop one Knights drive, and linebacker Eddie Lackey set up a Baylor touchdown with an interception at the UCF 32. \n",
      "Baylor needed just two plays to score after Lackey’s pick. Petty hit Levi Norwood over the middle, and the wide receiver evaded the UCF secondary for a 30-yard touchdown. \n",
      "Bortles made up for the two interceptions with some help from wide receiver Rannell Hall (four catches, 113 yards). Bortles connected with Hall on a short pass near the line of scrimmage at midfield, and Hall slipped a defender and outran the Baylor defense for a 50-yard touchdown. \n",
      "Hall’s score boosted the Knights’ lead to 21-13 with 5:05 left in the first half. \n",
      "Baylor kept punching back, though. Petty answered Hall’s score by running for a 13-yard touchdown, accented by a flip into the end zone when UCF defensive back Jacoby Glenn hit the diving quarterback in the legs. \n",
      "Bortles then led UCF on a nine-play, 83-yard touchdown drive, capped by another catch-and-run touchdown to Hall, this one going 34 yards. The extra point gave the Knights a 28-20 halftime lead. \n",
      "NOTES: UCF and Baylor both began the season unranked and went on to win their respective conferences. UCF finished 8-0 in the American Athletic, while Baylor won the Big 12 with an 8-1 mark. ... Baylor has been ranked in the top 10 for eight consecutive polls, a program record. ... UCF entered on an eight-game winning streak, the longest in program history.\n",

      "UPDATE 2-Libya says protesters agree to reopen oilfield; no progress in east\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "(Adds eastern autonomy movement, details) \n",
      "TRIPOLI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Libya hopes to resume production at one of its largest oilfields, El Sharara, within three days after protesters agreed to suspend their two-month stoppage, officials said on Thursday. \n",
      "Tribesmen calling for greater local power have blocked the 350,000-barrels-per-day field since the end of October, one of many disruptions that have crippled Libya’s vital oil sector. Oil prices fell below $110 a barrel on the news and were currently trading down 1.2 percent. \n",
      "But there was no sign of an end to the blockage of three oil ports in eastern Libya, with the pro-autonomy group holding them reiterating the government needed to share oil revenues with other regions of the OPEC producer. \n",
      "Libya is in turmoil as the government struggles to rein in dozens of militias that helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but kept their guns to make political and financial demands. \n",
      "The protesters agreed to suspend their strike after the government said it would listen to their demands, according to a defence ministry spokesman. \n",
      "“They agreed to lift the blockage,” the spokesman said. \n",
      "The field, located in the remote and volatile south, supplies crude to the Zawiya export terminal, unaffected by any disruption, and feeds the 120,000-bpd Zawiya refinery. \n",
      "Libya’s state National Oil Corp (NOC) hoped to resume output in three days, NOC spokesman Mohamed al-Harari said. \n",
      "“Engineers are preparing the field to restart production,” he said. \n",
      "The protesters had demanded the establishment of a local council and the granting of national identity cards for tribesmen from Tuareg minority. \n",
      "“Information out of Libya needs to be taken with some caution until confirmed by facts, but  this could bring a temporary increase in Libya production to about 600,000 barrels a day,” said oil analyst Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix in Zug. \n",
      "“Exports from Sharara would be easier to materialise if the protests are indeed lifted as the field exports from the port of Zawiya, and that port is open.” \n",
      "Militias and tribesmen have seized ports and oilfields across Libya to press for political or financial demands, cutting output to around 220,000 bpd, from 1.4 million bpd in July. Oil is the main source for the budget and for the funding of food imports. \n",
      "There was no sign of progress in the east despite the government’s announcement last month of another attempt by tribal elders to pressure an autonomy group to end the blockage of the Ras Lanuf, Es-Sider and Zuweitina ports, which accounted previously for 600,000 bpd. \n",
      "Abd-Rabbo al-Barassi, prime minister of the self-declared eastern autonomy government, said Tripoli needed to look into corruption claims and share oil wealth with other regions in Libya. \n",
      "He did not mention any talks to end the blockage, but criticised the government in an apparent response to a news conference on Wednesday in which the labour minister warned public salary payments were at risk due to the strikes. \n",
      "“How can the government use such methods. Why don’t they look into our demands,” he said, appearing on an opposition news channel from eastern Libya. \n",
      "The group is campaigning for a federal system sharing power among regions, similar to the arrangement in place before the Gaddafi era. \n",
      "“We demand that the government preserve the oil wealth,” he said. \n",
      "Western powers fear the North African country will slide into instability as the government struggles to rein in militias. \n",
      "Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said the government will act against the oil strikes but its nascent army, still in training, is too weak to tackle heavily armed protesters, analysts say.

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - An exiled former Rwandan intelligence chief and critic of President Paul Kagame has been found murdered in a Johannesburg hotel, South African police said on Thursday. \n",
      "Patrick Karegeya, who once headed military intelligence in his homeland, fled to South Africa along with former Rwandan army chief Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa after allegedly plotting a coup against Kagame. \n",
      "A Rwandan opposition party blamed Kagame’s government for Karegeya’s death, which it described as an assassination. \n",
      "Paul Ramakolo, a spokesman for South Africa’s Hawks, an elite crime fighting unit, confirmed Karegeya had been killed. “We will check if it was as a result of strangulation or what could be the factor,” he said. \n",
      "The opposition Rwanda National Congress said in a statement dated January 1 that Karegeya’s body was found in a hotel where he went for a meeting. \n",
      "“By killing its opponents, the criminal regime in Kigali seeks to intimidate and silence the Rwandan people into submission,” it said. \n",
      "Spokespeople at the Rwandan embassy in Pretoria were not immediately available to comment on the Rwanda National Congress’ accusation. \n",
      "Rwandan ambassador to South Africa Vincent Karega earlier told local radio SAFM he was not aware of details of the killing but that he knew Karegeya had been in the country for several years and had obtained asylum. \n",
      "“We encourage the authorities to really look into the matter so that we know exactly what happened,” he said. \n",
      "In 2011, a Rwandan military court sentenced Karegeya, Nyamwasa and two other exiled officers to 20 years in prison for threatening state security after they were tried in absentia. \n",
      "In 2010, Nyamwasa was shot in the stomach as he drove into the driveway of his upmarket Johannesburg home. He survived what his family said was an assassination attempt ordered by Kagame. \n",

      "'Breaking Bad' contest winner arrested in Florida on drug charges\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Investigators are looking at a gas leak as a potential cause for an explosion and fire that gutted a Minneapolis apartment building on New Year’s Day, killing at least one person and injuring 14 others, officials said on Thursday. \n",
      "The cause of the explosion and fire in the three-story building that had a grocery store on the ground floor and 10 apartments remained undetermined, but witnesses have told investigators they smelled gas before the blast, Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel told a news conference. \n",
      "Fire officials said a body was found on Thursday in the structure after crews began the slow process of removing debris. Two people were unaccounted for, officials said. \n",
      "Investigators believe the explosion happened on the second or third floor. Fire officials added that it could take weeks to determine a cause and it is possible that a cause for the explosion and fire might never be found. \n",
      "“We are sort of focusing more on the issue of a potential gas-type scenario,” Fruetel said, adding that witnesses had reported gas-like odors like when a pilot light on a gas stove goes out, or other natural gas-like smells. \n",
      "The multiple reports of those types of smells have led investigators to focus in that direction for a cause of the explosion and fire, Fruetel said. \n",
      "CenterPoint Energy spokeswoman Rebecca Virden said no gas odors or leaks were detected on CenterPoint’s distribution system in the area, which is fairly new. \n",
      "The building was built in 1886 and was in an ethnic community of mainly Somali immigrants near the West Bank campus of the University of Minnesota. The roof and upper floors collapsed leaving unstable ice-caked exterior walls and rubble. \n",
      "Fourteen people were transported to hospitals after the fire. \n",
      "On Thursday, three people were in critical condition and six in satisfactory condition at Hennepin County Medical Center. One person was in serious condition and one in good condition at University of Minnesota Medical Center Fairview. \n",
      "Building occupants were seen leaping or falling from the windows after the explosion and rescue crews said flames shot 20 feet above the windows. \n",
      "Firefighters were forced to withdraw from the building and battle the blaze from the exterior because of the heavy flames and concerns the structure could collapse. \n",

      "MIAMI (Reuters) - A Florida man who won a contest to watch the finale of the drug-themed TV show “Breaking Bad” with its cast has been arrested on charges he ran an underground synthetic marijuana distribution operation, police said on Thursday. \n",
      "In a possible case of life imitating art, Ryan Lee Carroll, 28, was arrested on New Year’s Eve and charged with manufacturing and shipping a synthetic marijuana known as “Spice” to distribution points across the country from his home in Fort Myers, in southwest Florida. \n",
      "Two other suspects were arrested and their homes served as additional manufacturing and storage facilities for the illicit drug operation, the Lee County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. \n",
      "“Ironically, Ryan Lee Carroll was a contest winner for the hit TV series ‘Breaking Bad’; a show about a chemistry teacher turned drug dealer,” the statement said. \n",
      "It said more than 700 pounds (315 kg) of 79,000 individually packaged packets of synthetic marijuana were seized with an estimated street value of $1.25 million. \n",
      "“The investigation has put a large dent in the availability of ‘Spice’ nationally,” the sheriff’s office said. \n",
      "In addition to the synthetic marijuana and by-products of the substance seized at Carroll’s home, deputies said they had confiscated a souvenir Hazmat suit signed by “Breaking Bad” cast members. \n",
      "A lawyer for Carroll could not immediately be reached for comment. \n",
      "The suit was similar to the one worn by Walter White, the fictitious former high school teacher in the TV show who amasses a fortune by manufacturing a potent variety of meth or methamphetamine. \n",

      "Preview: Predators at Bruins\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "The Boston Bruins are in unfamiliar territory after dropping their second straight game overall and losing in regulation at home for the first time since Oct. 26. The Bruins look to turn the recent tide on Thursday, when they host the Nashville Predators. Boston saw a two-goal lead evaporate late in the second period en route to a 5-3 loss to the New York Islanders on Tuesday. \n",
      "The Bruins had little difficulty with the Predators when they met in Music City on Dec. 23 as Jarome Iginla scored twice in a 6-2 victory. The setback was part of an 0-4-1 stretch for Nashville, which has rebounded to win its last two contests. Colin Wilson collected two goals and an assist in the Predators’ 6-4 victory over Detroit on Monday. \n",
      "TV: 7 p.m. ET, FSN Tennessee (Nashville), NESN (Boston) \n",
      "ABOUT THE PREDATORS (18-18-4): Mike Fisher has pieced together back-to-back three-point performances after being limited to just a goal and an assist in the 11 previous games in December. The 33-year-old is confident the team can make a surge despite being nine points out of a playoff berth in the congested Western Conference. “We’re back to .500 and feeling good about ourselves, and are getting on a roll,” Fisher told the Tennessean. “We’re not that far out of it. ... We just haven’t had the consistency that we need.” \n",
      "ABOUT THE BRUINS (26-12-2): Carl Soderberg, who scored a goal and set up two others in the teams’ previous meeting, has been cleared to return from a two-game absence due to an undisclosed injury. “No, it was not a concussion,” Soderberg told ESPN Boston. “I was fine. Yeah, I’m all set to go.” Defenseman Dougie Hamilton also is eyeing a return from a 10-game absence due to a lower-body injury suffered on Dec. 8 versus Toronto. \n",
      "1. Boston C David Krejci has scored three goals and set up three others during his five-game point streak. \n",
      "2. Iginla, who also is riding a five-game point streak, has recorded 57 points (32 goals, 25 assists) in 51 career meetings with Nashville. \n",
      "3. Nashville C Craig Smith scored his 11th goal versus Detroit to seize sole possession of the team lead in that department. \n",

      "The passengers, alerted to a suspicious bag, evacuated the bus minutes before the bomb went off on December 22. A police explosives expert was lightly wounded in the blast, which was powerful enough to blow out the vehicle’s windows. \n",
      "Israel’s Shin Bet security agency said in a statement that four Palestinians from the West Bank town of Bethlehem had been arrested - three suspected of preparing the bomb, one of bringing it to the bus. \n",
      "One of the first three is a member of the Palestinian police force, said the statement, which came after a court lifted a gag order on the case. Ten other people have been arrested for “infrastructure activities”, it said without giving details, and the investigation is continuing. \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "ATHENS, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Greece beat its target for taking up European Union co-financing funds in 2013 after it streamlined businesses’ access to the money, the Development Ministry said on Thursday. \n",
      "Government data showed Athens beat its 3.89 billion euros ($5.36 billion) target - one of the conditions of its European Union-International Monetary Fund bailout - by 710 million. \n",
      "Six years of recession have forced thousands of businesses to close and sent unemployment to record levels. The economy is forecast to return to 0.6 percent growth this year. \n",
      "Greece must make sure it is eligible for 5.5 billion of EU funds by 2015 under its current 20.5 billion EU co-financing programme, Development Minister Kostis Hatzidakis said. \n",
      "“The absorption rate beat even the most upbeat projections,” he said in a statement. \n",
      "Investment in debt-laden Greece has dropped by about 60 percent since its prolonged recession began in 2008, crimping efforts to exit the downturn and kick-start growth. \n",
      "Greece has been rescued from bankruptcy by the EU and IMF twice since 2010 with 240 billion euros of loans. \n",
      "Hatzidakis said that Greece has shortened procedures for co-financed projects and started work again in December on a 7.6 billion euro toll road project that had been mothballed for three years. \n",
      "“(The programme) cannot on its own resolve the problems faced by businesses and the economy,” Hatzidakis said. “But it can be a catalyst for the return to growth.” \n",
      "Greece ranked fourth out of the EU’s 27 member states in absorbing the funds in 2013, up from 18th a year earlier.\n",

      "By Rodrigo Campos \n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - World equity markets kicked off 2014 with a whimper on Thursday as slightly disappointing Chinese manufacturing data triggered some profit-taking, while oil prices were sharply lower as Libya prepared to reopen a major oilfield. \n",
      "U.S. stock indexes posted their largest falls in three weeks on the first trading day of 2014, after the benchmark S&P; 500  finished its best year since 1997. \n",
      "The dollar rallied against a basket of major currencies  as U.S. jobs, housing and manufacturing data gave support to the Federal Reserve’s decision to start slowing its stimulus program this month. \n",
      "Global manufacturing ended 2013 on a strong note as major exporters like Japan, Germany and Italy posted their fastest growth in years, although manufacturing data from China proved disappointing. \n",
      "“There’s no fundamental underpinning to the decline today, just basic portfolio rebalancing on the first day of a new tax year,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Global Investments. “People are taking profits and seeking bargains.” \n",
      "The Dow Jones industrial average fell 135.31 points or 0.82 percent, to 16,441.35, the S&P; 500 lost 16.38 points or 0.89 percent, to 1,831.98 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 33.521 points or 0.8 percent, to 4,143.069. \n",
      "The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 ended down 0.8 percent after starting the day at a 5-1/2-year high. MSCI’s 45-country share index was down 1 percent. U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures fell 2.1 percent. \n",
      "Crude oil prices fell after Libya prepared to restart a major oilfield and on speculation of a sharp rise in U.S. stocks. \n",
      "Brent was last down 2.8 percent at $107.72 a barrel while U.S. crude was last at $95.47 per barrel, down 3 percent, the most since November 2012. \n",
      "A report by industry group Genscape showed a 1 million barrel rise in stocks at Cushing, Oklahoma, the benchmark delivery point for U.S. oil futures. \n",
      "Spot gold climbed 1.5 percent to $1,223.39 an ounce. The move recouped a few of the losses that made last year gold’s worst in three decades. \n",
      "Three-month copper rose to its highest level in seven months but failed to hold above resistance near $7,420 per ton. It was recently up 0.5 percent at $7,393. \n",
      "The euro, the strongest-performing major currency in 2013 but historically a weaker performer at the start of a calendar year, dropped to a two-week low of $1.3634 and last traded 0.7 percent lower at $1.3654. \n",
      "The dollar rose to its strongest level versus the yen since October 2008, hitting a high of 105.44 yen, before erasing gains to trade down 0.5 percent at 104.75 yen. \n",
      "Against a basket of major currencies, the greenback rose 0.7 percent — the most in five months. \n",
      "“The U.S. dollar has started the year with strength, and a shift in market dynamics suggests the dollar may continue to gain versus the euro and other counterparts,” said David Rodriguez, quantitative strategist at DailyFX in New York. \n",
      "Amid a firming jobs market and brightening economic outlook, the Federal Reserve said in December it would reduce its monthly $85 billion bond buying program by $10 billion starting in January. \n",
      "Yields on U.S. 10-year paper dipped below 3 percent after hitting a high of 3.04 percent. U.S. Treasuries prices were up, with investors moving out of stocks after last year’s jump.\n",

      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Saudi leader of an al-Qaeda spinoff group arrested in Lebanon this week was a key fundraiser in the Gulf for militants fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, official and private experts say. \n",
      "The Lebanese army arrested Muhammad al-Majid, who leads the Lebanon-based Abdullah Azzam Brigades which claimed a double suicide attack on the Iranian embassy in Beirut last November. \n",
      "That attack was part of a spiral of sectarian violence in Lebanon that appears to be a spillover from Syria’s civil war. In the latest incident, a car bomb killed at least five people in a Shi’ite Muslim stronghold in southern Beirut on Thursday. \n",
      "Laith Alkhouri of Flashpoint Partners, a private group which monitors militant websites for business and government clients, said Majid had “been behind a great deal of financing to the jihadists fighting in Syria.” \n",
      "U.S. and European officials say that the most militant Sunni factions fighting Assad’s forces, including the Nusrah Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, both aligned with al-Qaeda, are being financed largely by wealthy families in Saudi Arabia and Gulf states. \n",
      "A U.S. official who declined to be identified said Majid’s arrest was, “at least a temporary setback, but certainly not a death blow, to the Ziad al-Jarrah Battalions, one of the most powerful Sunni terrorist groups in Lebanon.” \n",
      "“Under Majid’s leadership, the group exported a degree of the sectarian carnage of the Syrian civil war to Lebanon by targeting Iranian and Hezbollah interests. At the same time, this is a faction that has demonstrated its resilience in the past, and Majid’s experienced deputies may well step up to the plate in his absence,” the official said. \n",
      "The Saudi government has made serious efforts to block fundraising for extreme Islamist Syrian rebels, U.S. officials said, but Gulf state governments have been more tolerant. \n",
      "Alkhouri said that over the last two years, fundraisers based in Kuwait, often using Kuwaiti bank accounts, have been active raising funds for anti-Assad forces using social media outlets including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Skype. \n",
      "In June 2012, Majid issued an audio message in which he criticized the Saudi government for impeding a fundraising campaign several prominent Wahhabi Muslim scholars based in the Gulf had launched in support of Syrian rebels. \n",
      "According to Alkhouri, in his audio message Majid exhorted listeners to donate funds to Syrian rebels, saying: “No one can prevent you from supporting our brothers in Syria, and each one of you can collect money from his acquaintances, relatives and women, and deliver it to those he trusts from the people of Syria and the countries surrounding it.” \n",
      "Alkhouri said Majid went on to spell out a Kuwait link, saying that for “He who does not know anyone, then in Kuwait there is good activity in gathering money for our brothers in Syria, led by known scholars and their names are declared and reaching them is easy, and anyone can travel to them.” \n",
      "In a subsequent audio recording released in August 2012, Alkhouri said, Majid had implicitly threatened Lebanese Shi’ites, whose ostensible allies, the government of Iran and the Hezbollah movement, have strongly backed Assad. \n",
      "Last year, the Azzam Brigades, named after an associate of the late Osama bin Laden, were formally designated by the U.S, State Department as a foreign terrorist organization. \n",
      "The State Department said the group was divided into two branches: one called the Yusuf al-‘Uyayri Batallions, named after a founder of Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Lebanon based Ziyad al-Jarrah Battalions, named after one of the airliner hijackers who attacked New York  and Washington on Sept. 11, 2001.

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A day after the Syrian Electronic Army said it had hacked into Skype’s social media accounts, the Internet calling service acknowledged on Thursday it had been hit with a “cyber attack” but said no user information was compromised. \n",
      "A Tweet posted on Skype’s official Twitter feed on Wednesday read: “Don’t use Microsoft emails (hotmail, outlook), They are monitoring your accounts and selling the data to the governments. More details soon. #SEA” \n",
      "Similar messages were posted on Skype’s official Facebook pages and on a blog on its website before being taken down later in the afternoon. Skype is owned by Microsoft Corp. \n",
      "The Syrian Electronic Army, an amorphous hacking collective that supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, later claimed the attack. \n",
      "The SEA also posted on its Twitter feed the contact information of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s retiring chief executive, along with the message: “You can thank Microsoft for monitoring your accounts/emails using this details. #SEA” \n",
      "That message was a reference to revelations last year by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, was part of the NSA’s program to monitor communications through some of the biggest U.S. Internet companies. \n",
      "“We recently became aware of a targeted cyber attack that led to access to Skype’s social media properties, but these credentials were quickly reset,” a spokeswoman for Skype said in a statement released on Thursday. “No user information was compromised.” \n",
      "The NSA’s practices essentially made Microsoft and other technology companies partners in government surveillance efforts against private citizens. The company last month joined seven other top technology firms in pressing President Barack Obama to rein in the U.S. government’s electronic spying. \n",
      "A U.S. district judge in December ruled the U.S. government’s gathering of Americans’ phone records was likely unlawful and raised “serious doubts” about the value of the so-called metadata counterterrorism program. \n",

      "UPDATE 2-Hyundai, Kia face fading growth as currency tides buoy Japan rivals\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "* S. Korean firms see 2014 car sales at 7.86 mln, up 4 pct \n",
      "* Quick weakening of yen favours exports by Japanese peers \n",
      "* Shares skid with won at 5-year high vs dollar, yen \n",
      "By Hyunjoo Jin \n",
      "SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The man who led South Korea’s auto industry on a tear through the last decade said Hyundai Motor Co  and Kia Motors Corp expect what will be their lowest annual sales growth since 2003 as the weak yen fires up Japanese rivals. \n",
      "In his annual New Year speech to staff on Thursday, 75-year-old group chairman Chung Mong-koo said sales at Hyundai and its smaller affiliate Kia will likely grow just 4 percent in 2014. Global competition is about to get tougher in an industry facing changing technology and an uncertain future, he warned. \n",
      "The Korean duo exports about two-thirds of its cars from South Korea, a much higher proportion than Japanese peers, making them more vulnerable to currency fluctuations. A weaker yen gives Japanese carmakers like Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co leeway to offer customers better deals in key export markets like the United States - the same advantage that helped Hyundai and Kia after the global financial crisis of 2008. \n",
      "“Competition among companies is intensifying, as the global economy has entered an era of low growth,” Chung said in his traditional New Year address to some 1,000 employees at Hyundai’s Seoul headquarters. “Technological convergence leads to change in the industry, and adds to uncertainty.” \n",
      "On Thursday, the won hit its highest level for more than five years against both the dollar and the yen, prompting talk in Seoul of possible government intervention in currency markets to help exporters. Shares in Hyundai and Kia, ranked fifth in the world by combined global sales, ended down 5.1 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively. \n",
      "The yen’s fall has been stoked by Japan’s attempts to support its export industries and pull its economy out of a two-decade slump. A senior official in South Korea earlier this week expressed concerns that the country’s own exporters could be hurt as a result: auto exports typically account for close to 9 percent of South Korea’s total. \n",
      "Toyota is on course for record profits in the financial year ended March 2014, largely helped by the weaker yen. That trend also helped Mazda Motor Corp and Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd become two of the top three performers in the Nikkei stock average in 2013. \n",
      "The year ahead promises to be testing for Chung, more than 10 years into the job leading the company founded by his father. Hyundai has shaken up U.S. management amid a fall in market share there, while a new free trade deal with the European Union means German rivals are encroaching on its once-impregnable domestic stronghold. \n",
      "Hyundai and its affiliate Kia are planning for global sales of a combined 7.86 million vehicles this year, up from 7.56 million in 2013. To achieve that, Chung is counting on growth from revamped versions of key models like the Genesis and Sonata sedans, as well increased production capacity in China. \n",
      "The forecast increase for 2014 would be in line with the global auto market’s projected sales growth of 4 percent, but is the lowest since 2003’s 2.3 percent. It’s also bleak by comparison with breakneck growth at one of the auto industry’s biggest success stories during the global economic downturn at the end of the last decade. \n",
      "At their growth peak in 2010, Hyundai and Kia’s annual sales climbed 24 percent as the weaker Korean won allowed them to offer stylish, feature-loaded new cars at affordable prices. \n",
      "“The yen’s weakness is not welcoming news to Hyundai investors. This may adversely affect its market share and sales,” said Song Sun-jae, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities. \n",
      "However, he said he still expects Hyundai and Kia to sell 8 million vehicles this year, higher than its target, and slightly outperform the global market. “Hyundai and Kia have offered conservative sales targets and beat them in recent years. I expect this year would be no different,” he said. \n",
      "In regulatory filings, Hyundai said it was targeting sales of 4.9 million vehicles this year, while Kia’s goal is to reach 2.96 million. \n",
      "The pair’s 2013 sales did beat the original Hyundai-Kia target of 7.41 million as growth in China and Brazil offset a lackluster showing at home. In South Korea, auto makers like Germany’s Volkswagen AG have been boosted by a free trade pact between the country and the European Union. \n",
      "But at 6 percent, 2013’s increase was below the previous year’s 8 percent rise, leaving Hyundai-Kia already in their third straight year of declining growth. \n",
      "Hyundai and Kia have increased overseas production over the years. They made 49 percent of their cars in Korea, according to industry data for 2012, the last year for which figures have been released. Of those, however, they still exported 67 percent. \n",
      "By comparison, Honda makes about 20 percent of its cars in Japan, and of those it exports about 20 percent. \n",
      "In recent years, Chung’s focus has been more on managing quality and brand-building than new plants. But the export comparisons have left company watchers wondering whether Hyundai and Kia might announce plans to build new plants in the U.S. or other markets this year. \n",
      "Fuelling those questions, analysts say capacity constraints, along with aging models and rising competition, may have led Hyundai to miss its 2013 sales target for the U.S. Automakers including Hyundai plan to announce U.S. sales on Friday. \n",
      "The task of bolstering Hyundai in the U.S. in a year of crucial new launches now falls to sales head David Zuchowski, who recently replaced John Krafcik as U.S. chief. \n",
      "Kia also plans to start production at its third plant in China early this year, while Hyundai has added capacity of 150,000 vehicles at its third factory in Beijing. \n",

      "Ride service Uber, brash darling of Silicon Valley, stalks new markets\n",
      "9 Min Read\n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick knows the value of a good controversy. \n",
      "After his upstart company, which lets people summon rides at the touch of a smartphone button, provoked a flurry of social media outrage in December over pricing policies that can result in exorbitant fares, Kalanick addressed prospective New Year’s Eve customers. \n",
      "“If you absolutely need a ride between 1 and 3 a.m., Uber will be very reliable,” Kalanick said in a YouTube video. “But it will be a pricey ride, and you just have to accept that.” The company’s pricing policies can sometimes result in fares that are eight times higher than usual. \n",
      "Like the message or not, plenty of people heard it - and fewer complaints emerged about Uber’s New Year’s Eve rates. \n",
      "Kalanick has taken a similarly tough tack with regulators, local officials, taxi-company foes and emerging competitors as he moves to build Uber into a global force. \n",
      "But it will take a lot more than a popular smartphone app, a loyal Silicon Valley following and a knack for turning free-market ideology into publicity to fulfill Kalanick’s vision of a “lifestyle and logistics” company that delivers far more than rides. \n",
      "Uber has entered more than 60 markets, ranging from its hometown of San Francisco to Berlin to Tokyo. Leaked financials in December indicate that the company, which began connecting passengers with drivers of vehicles for hire about 3-1/2 years ago, is generating $200 million a year in revenue beyond what it pays to drivers. \n",
      "Investors, led by Google Inc, have given Uber around $400 million and valued it at $3.5 billion. With a service that stitches together the buzziest categories in entrepreneurship - among them mapping, smartphones, and local services - Uber is widely seen as one of the hottest properties in Silicon Valley. \n",
      "Yet Uber still faces daunting regulatory hurdles that have left it shut out of major markets such as Miami. Lawsuits, many from taxi companies, are piling up. Competitors such as Hailo, Sidecar and Lyft are coming on strong. And aside from publicity stunts involving delivery of kittens, ice cream and Christmas trees, Uber has yet to provide anything beyond rides. \n",
      "Delivery “can become an extremely complex thing,” said Kerry Rice, a digital media analyst at Needham. “It’s about the scheduling and the software and the ability to manage a fleet.” \n",
      "Delivery is currently a hot topic among Internet retailers, with companies like eBay Inc, Amazon.com Inc, and Google all experimenting with same-day shipping. But it has proven a graveyard in the past for dot-com companies, such as Webvan and Kosmo, which had dreams of challenging the global delivery leaders. \n",
      "Uber declined to comment on its plans. \n",
      "When Uber started offering its service in 2010, it was a way to connect riders with town car drivers who had extra time between scheduled gigs. The riders sign up via an app, with a portion of their fare going to Uber and a portion to the drivers, who are independent contractors. \n",
      "It developed a loyal following in the first cities where it launched - including San Francisco, New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. - in part because Uber served up rides in areas with a dearth of taxis. The rides, in black town cars, offered more pizzazz and comfort than a taxi, but without the advance-booking that limo services typically require. \n",
      "Uber also proved masterful at harnessing publicity tied to one-time events. In Boston, for example, it offered free rides along a subway line that was shut down for repairs. \n",
      "The company has adroitly tapped in to social media to rally fans, who attend mixers, lobby politicians, sign Facebook petitions and speak up at local hearings that affecting Uber. \n",
      "In 2012, the Washington D.C. city council was weighing a measure that would make Uber sedans cost five times the price of cabs - until Uber fans bombarded council members with emails and tweets. The council then passed an amendment allowing Uber to do business, generating even more publicity. \n",
      "But there have been plenty of regulatory setbacks too. In some cities, such as Miami; Austin, Texas; and Vancouver, British Columbia, local regulations keep Uber out, typically by requiring minimum fares or minimum wait periods between the time a customer requests a ride and the time that customer steps in to the car. \n",
      "In other areas where Uber already operates, lobbying by the taxi industry has resulted in efforts to change the law to shut down app-based ride services. In Seattle, the city council is considering limiting such services to 100 part-time drivers a week and requiring special licenses. \n",
      "Uber chalked up some regulatory wins during 2013, including in Dallas and Denver. But the company does not do business in one quarter of the 20 largest cities in the United States. \n",
      "The taxi industry is also fighting Uber in court. In Chicago, local cab companies have filed a federal lawsuit alleging various illegal practices by Uber, including misleading marketing and unfair competition. Boston cabbies have filed a similar case. Uber declined to comment. \n",
      "Separately, a group of California Uber drivers is seeking class status for a lawsuit alleging they get stiffed on tips and business expenses such as gasoline. \n",
      "“The allegations made against our company are entirely without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously,” an Uber spokesman said. “Our technology platform has allowed thousands of drivers to generate an independent wage and build their own small businesses.” \n",
      "Uber recently won a state court victory in Massachusetts, where the city of Cambridge unsuccessfully sued to try to overturn a state agency’s ruling that Uber could operate while federal officials evaluate the company’s technology. No precedent-setting federal cases have been decided yet. \n",
      "California provides Uber’s surest footing in regulatory terms: the state’s Public Utilities Commission gave app-based ride companies a green light in September. But in October, Uber, seeking to avoid CPUC oversight entirely, filed a petition for rehearing, arguing the body does not have jurisdiction over technology companies. \n",
      "Meanwhile, Uber is going toe to toe with competitors such as Sidecar, which allows ordinary people to provide paid rides in their own cars. Uber has launched UberX, a lower-priced service that uses mid-range cars rather than the black town cars on which it built its reputation. \n",
      "“Travis (Kalanick) is not ceding ground at any price point,” said Bill Gurley, a partner at venture-capital firm Benchmark who has backed Uber since early 2011. \n",
      "Gurley and others are betting there are enough people willing to pay a premium - even a very large one - for a reliable ride, or eventually for delivery services. One of Uber’s innovations is so-called surge pricing, under which rates go up at times of high demand or low supply of cars. \n",
      "During a recent snowstorm in New York, some Uber users tweeted photos of notices from the company that their fare would be as much as 8.5 times normal. At Sidecar, by comparison, surge pricing is also used, but it is capped at three times the normal rates, a spokeswoman said. \n",
      "Kalanick defends surge pricing as both a matter of free-market principle and as the best way to assure that people can get a ride when they really need one. \n",
      "“You’ll always be notified in BIG, BOLD print if surge pricing is in effect,” the company wrote in a December 30 blog post, linking to the video of Kalanick explaining the policy. \n",
      "Many customers still perceive surge pricing as price gouging, and the policy will not endear the company to regulators. Yet even critics sometimes appear to sustain a love-hate relationship with Uber and its combative CEO. \n",
      "“You can try to rationalize it, but it won’t change the ill feelings most of us have toward your service,” a Los Angeles customer calling herself Pasta Versaucy tweeted to Kalanick on Wednesday, in reference to high New Year’s Eve rates. \n",
      "A little while later, she sent out another tweet. “Hypothetically speaking: can I order an @Uber to charter a burger to my house? Because I totally would.” \n",
      "Kalanick, who had engaged in some New Year’s Twitter banter with her and other critics, let the question go unanswered. \n",

      "Pimco Total Return has first down year since 1999: Morningstar\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Pimco Total Return Fund, the world’s largest bond fund, had a negative return for 2013 of nearly 2 percent, its first annual loss in 14 years, as fears of a reduction in the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying sent Treasury prices lower, preliminary data from Morningstar showed on Thursday. \n",
      "The performance was the weakest for the fund since 1994, when it posted a negative return of 3.6 percent, Morningstar data showed. The fund declined about 1 percent in December, beating just 6 percent of peers, according to preliminary Morningstar data. \n",
      "Pimco Total Return, with $244 billion in assets, is the flagship of the Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co. Bill Gross, the legendary manager of the fund, is the firm’s co-founder and co-chief investment officer. \n",
      "The performance of Gross’s fund is closely watched because Pimco manages roughly $1.97 trillion in assets and is one of the world’s largest bond managers. Gross’s views, along with those of co-Chief Investment Officer and Chief Executive Mohamed El-Erian, are widely influential. \n",
      "Pimco is a unit of European financial services company Allianz SE. \n",
      "The fund suffered last year from a sizeable bet on U.S. Treasuries, whose prices declined after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled in late May that the central bank could begin scaling back its bond-buying stimulus if the U.S. economy looked strong enough. \n",
      "“It highlights the risk of bond investing, that even managers with billions of assets under their guidance can have a bad year,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P; Capital IQ. \n",
      "The Pimco Total Return Fund had a 37 percent exposure to Treasuries at the end of May, making it the fund’s largest holding, according to data released on the Pimco website last year and compiled by Reuters. The fund’s exposure to U.S. government debt remained high throughout the year despite the selloff in Treasuries, and was at 37 percent at the end of November. \n",
      "Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury soared after Bernanke testified before Congress on May 22 that the central bank could begin scaling back its $85 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgages later in 2013. \n",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield, which fell to a low for the year of 1.62 percent on May 2, ended 2013 above 3 percent, an increase of about 140 basis points. Bond yields move inversely to their prices. \n",
      "In recent letters to investors and posts on social media platform Twitter, Gross has recommended that investors buy shorter-dated Treasuries on expectations that the Fed will keep short-term interest rates low until 2016 or later. \n",
      "The Pimco Total Return Exchange-Traded Fund, an actively managed ETF designed to mimic the strategy of the flagship mutual fund, fell 0.85 percent in December, making it the worst performer of its category for the month and resulting in a drop of 1.2 percent for the year. \n",
      "That annual return still beat 80 percent of peers, however, according to the preliminary data from Morningstar. Investors pulled $115.8 million from the ETF in December, marking its eighth straight month of withdrawals, Morningstar data showed. The ETF has about $3.5 billion in assets. \n",
      "Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund, a competitor to the Pimco fund, fell 0.7 percent in December, beating 19 percent of peers. The fund had outflows of $2.08 billion in December, Reuters reported on Wednesday. \n",
      "Gundlach’s fund, which has about $31 billion in assets and is the flagship of Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, rose 0.02 percent last year, beating 88 percent of peers, according to the preliminary Morningstar data. \n",

      "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, comatose since a 2006 stroke, slipped closer to death on Thursday after a sharp decline in the condition of the ex-general who long symbolized Israel’s military might. \n",
      "Reviled by Arabs over his hardline policies and viewed with a mixture of respect and suspicion by many Israelis, 85-year-old Sharon has been on life support at Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv for the past eight years, far from the public gaze. \n",
      "“I am no prophet, but the feeling of his doctors and his sons ... is that there has been a change for the worse,” Sheba director Zeev Rotstein told reporters. \n",
      "Rotstein, in the first official medical statement on Sharon’s condition after reports on Wednesday that he had suffered a kidney malfunction, said doctors expect a deterioration in several life-sustaining organs. \n",
      "“We are defining his condition as critical, and there is definitely a threat to his life,” he said. “The feeling of everyone ... is that this decline is very serious.” \n",
      "Sharon’s two sons were at his bedside, doctors said, and a state funeral was planned. \n",
      "One of Israel’s most famous generals, Sharon left his mark on the region through military invasion, Jewish settlement building on captured land and a shock, unilateral decision to pull Israeli troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005. \n",
      "In 1983, an Israeli state inquiry found Sharon, then the defense minister, indirectly responsible for the killing of hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children at Beirut’s Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. He was forced to resign his post. \n",
      "The slaughter took place after the Israeli army, which invaded Lebanon in 1982, allowed Israeli-backed Christian Phalangist militiamen to enter the camps, ostensibly to search for Palestinian gunmen. \n",
      "“He’ll be remembered as the last of his generation of Israeli fighters and founders,” Dedi Cohen, a 38-year-old lawyer, told Reuters in Tel Aviv. \n",
      "“He was a bulldozer who got things done. I know he was controversial, but he had values. He stood for something. That’s missing today,” Cohen said. \n",
      "Raanan Gissin, a former senior aide to Sharon, said that doctors believe death could come within days or even hours. \n",
      "“It’s a very sad moment ... for people in Israel because Ariel Sharon was an icon in Israel,” Gissin said. \n",
      "Sharon’s devastating illness began shortly after he quit the right-wing Likud party, where he had promoted Jewish settlement in territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war, and founded a centrist faction with the declared aim of advancing peace with his long-standing foe, the Palestinians. \n",
      "Battling a Palestinian uprising that began in 2000 after peace talks collapsed, Sharon initiated the building of a contentious barrier across the occupied West Bank and presented a plan to “disengage” from the Gaza Strip. \n",
      "“As a prime minister he took a very brave step in leaving the (Gaza) settlements. He did something unexpected that was very surprising for a right-wing prime minister, for the better,” said Anat Harel, 25, a computer science student in the southern town of Ashkelon. \n",
      "Critics of Sharon’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza point to the territory’s seizure two years later by Hamas Islamists opposed to Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and repeated rocket fire from the enclave. \n",
      "“We worked together but it is no secret that our ways parted at the moment he started talking about the (Gaza) disengagement,” Yuli Edelstein, the Speaker of the Israeli Parliament, said on Israel Radio. \n",
      "“But even these things do not cancel out his military past, his contribution to the country, or my memories of him.” \n",
      "In the Gaza Strip, a Hamas leader spoke bitterly of a man the movement sees as one of the Palestinians’ worst enemies. \n",
      "“Ariel Sharon is going the same direction as other tyrants and criminals whose hands were covered in Palestinian blood,” said the leader, Khalil al-Hayya. \n",
      "There was no sympathy either in the occupied West Bank. \n",
      "“God willing he dies,” said Rauf Ramia, a laborer from the Qalandia refugee camp. “He’s a terrible person.” \n",

      "Will Snowden’s disclosures finally rein in the NSA?\n",
      "\n",
      "11 Min Read\n",
      " \n",
      "The National Security Agency, most secretive of the government’s 16 intelligence arms, is unaccustomed to the glare of publicity. But fierce public attention has been focused on the eavesdropping agency since the startling revelations from Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor now granted temporary asylum in Moscow. \n",
      "These disclosures are not the first time the NSA, often known as “No Such Agency,” has been caught surreptitiously reading Americans’ private communications. The agency, however, has largely been able to  evade serious consequences or restrictions after the earlier revelations. In fact, the NSA’s surveillance of Americans has increased exponentially. \n",
      "During the mid-1970s, a special Senate committee headed by Senator Frank Church, an Idaho Democrat, focused a spotlight on NSA abuses. But those disclosures were overshadowed by the panel’s investigation of the Central Intelligence Agency, which revealed decades of assassination attempts, illegal activities and misadventures. \n",
      "The CIA got most of the headlines. But the Church Committee’s televised hearings also revealed the NSA’s Project Shamrock — under which three major telecom companies, RCA, ITT and Western Union, had given the NSA copies of all cable traffic entering and leaving the United States. \n",
      "The program began in 1945, with the NSA’s Army predecessor; and continued in 1952, when a secret presidential order established the NSA as part of the Defense Department. First microfilms and, later, tapes of every cable were given daily to NSA and then distributed to the FBI, the CIA, the Secret Service and the Pentagon. Project Shamrock was axed by NSA after the committee exposed it. \n",
      "The CIA abuses and illegal programs received wider publicity than the NSA’s activities, in part because the committee revealed assassination plots by the CIA against foreign leaders. The Senate committee reported that the CIA was involved, encouraged, or knew about plots to assassinate or overthrow eight foreign leaders. Five of these leaders died violently, including Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba of the Congo and dictator Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. \n",
      "The agency hired two Mafia figures, Johnny Roselli and Sam Giancana, to try to kill Fidel Castro with six gelatin pills filled with botulinum toxin. The agency had tested its pills on monkeys. The monkeys died. Castro didn’t. No one even got close enough to the Cuban leader to slip the pills into his food or drink. Both mobsters were later murdered by unknown assailants. \n",
      "The CIA had also spied on American citizens — anti-Vietnam War activists and others — in operation CHAOS. The agency also tried out LSD and mind-altering drugs on Americans, who were unaware they were being dosed. One, Frank Olson, a civilian Army researcher, went out the window of a New York hotel room under murky circumstances nine days after the CIA laced his after-dinner Cointreau with LSD. \n",
      "In one of the Church Committee’s more memorable episodes, CIA Director William Colby revealed a poison dart gun used to inject agency targets. The gun, which Colby called “a non-discernible microbioinoculator,” fired darts so tiny that the person shot would feel nothing and no trace of the dart or the poison would be found in a later examination of the body. Church waved the dart gun for the news photographers, and the photo made front pages across the country. \n",
      "The committee also found out the CIA had illegally opened first-class mail. The agency screened a total of more than 28 million letters and opened 215,000 in a program called HTLingual. The agency knew it was breaking the law. One memo by a senior CIA official said U.S. intelligence agencies must \"vigorously deny\" the mail program, which should be \"relatively easy to 'hush up.'\" \n",
      "When the CIA’s legendary counterintelligence chief, James J. Angleton, testified to the committee, he defended the mail-opening program. “It’s inconceivable,” Angleton said, “that a secret intelligence arm of the government has to comply with all the overt orders of the government.” \n",
      "Pressed by the senators, Angleton “withdrew” the startling statement — but refused to say whether he believed it. \n",
      "In the wake of these revelations, reforms were put in place to reassure the public that such abuses would not be repeated. The Senate and the House of Representative created intelligence committees to oversee the agencies. A new law required a presidential “finding” be obtained before a covert operation could be undertaken. President Gerald R. Ford issued an order prohibiting the assassination of foreign leaders. \n",
      "In addition, a special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was created to review requests for wiretaps and surveillance of citizens and others. The judges bristle at any suggestion that the court acts as a rubber stamp — but it has rarely turned down the government’s surveillance requests. \n",
      "Despite the Church Committee’s revelations of intelligence abuses and law-breaking, critics claimed the panel had irreparably harmed the agencies and national security. If anything, however, the agencies have emerged today more powerful than ever. \n",
      "One major reason is that the protections put in place after the Church Committee disclosures have not worked as expected. After the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush secretly authorized the NSA to conduct a program of warrantless wiretapping of Americans. The program operated without approval by the special surveillance court. \n",
      "It was exposed in 2005 by New York Times reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau. Yet Congress, in response, did not end the program or even restrict it. Instead, Congress passed and Bush signed a law in 2007 that, in effect, legalized the NSA’s warrantless surveillance program. \n",
      "Since Snowden’s disclosures about the NSA, it has become apparent that the agency’s eavesdropping in the United States and around the globe is far more extensive than previously known. The former contractor has revealed a program of NSA “metadata” collection, in which billions of U.S. telephone calls are logged every day, and the numbers, though not the contents, recorded. As were emails. Much like Project Shamrock decades ago, major U.S. telecom companies have been providing their records to the government. \n",
      "There was outrage in Europe and elsewhere at the news that the NSA was spying on its allies. Germans, in particular, were furious to learn that the NSA had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. \n",
      "Judge Richard J. Leon of the federal district court in Washington recently called the metadata program likely unconstitutional, a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and “almost Orwellian.” He said the government had not shown “a single instance” when all that snooping had foiled a terrorist plot. A presidential advisory panel has also now called for an end to the NSA’s metadata collection. \n",
      "Then last week [[Dec. 27 if it runs this week]  a federal district court judge in New York, William Pauley, ruled the bulk collection program legal and said it might even have headed off the 9/11 terrorist attack. With the courts split, the issue may have to be decided by the appeals courts, the Supreme Court, or Congress. \n",
      "If the NSA has vastly increased its power and programs, it is also now clear that the CIA had never been effectively reined in by the post-Church Committee reforms. In the wake of 9/11, the agency tortured suspected terrorists by “waterboarding,” or simulated drowning, and by subjecting suspects to extreme temperatures, sleep deprivation and other forms of “enhanced interrogation” methods approved by the Bush administration. \n",
      "These took place in the agency's \"black sites\" overseas. In addition, the CIA engaged in a program of \"rendition,\" under which suspects were returned to countries where they would almost certainly be imprisoned and tortured for information. Despite President Barack Obama's promises to place greater controls on the use of drones by the CIA and the military, the weapons continue to kill innocent civilians as well as militants. And in spite of Ford's ban on assassinations, the drones have been used to target individuals -- including Americans. \n",
      "During the Cold War, when the United States faced off against the Soviet Union, the threat posed by Moscow and communism was cited as the justification for illegal actions by the intelligence agencies. Today, terrorism has replaced communism as the threat used to justify secret or questionable activities abroad and violations of privacy and the individual rights of Americans at home. \n",
      "Against that background, we should remember James Madison’s words. “Perhaps it is a universal truth,” he wrote to Thomas Jefferson in 1798, “that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged against provisions against danger, real or pretended from abroad.” \n",
      "Those words are as relevant today as when they were written more than 200 years ago. \n",

      "* New data clarifies link between poverty and poaching \n",
      "* Illegal elephant killings on the rise \n",
      "* Poor villagers see no benefit from illicit ivory trade \n",
      "By Ed Stoddard \n",
      "JOHANNESBURG, Jan 2 (Reuters) - What do infant mortality and elephant poaching have in common? Plenty, according to conservation groups. \n",
      "Researchers have for the first time made clear connections between elephant poaching in Africa, which has been surging to meet soaring ivory demand in Asia, and factors such as poverty, as shown by high rates of child deaths, and corruption. \n",
      "These links have always been suspected but never pinned down with hard data. \n",
      "The findings come in a report prepared for an African elephant summit in Botswana in December by groups including TRAFFIC, which tracks the global trade in wildlife products, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. \n",
      "Areas where child mortality and poverty are worst also see higher levels of elephant poaching, but poor villagers typically do not benefit from the illicit ivory trade. \n",
      "In this regard, the ivory trade - with its long and blood-stained history - is similar to other extractive industries in Africa, which have been exploited to meet demand elsewhere with few rewards for local people. \n",
      "Demand for ivory - used for carvings and valued for millennia for its colour and texture - has been rising sharply in newly affluent Asian countries, notably China, fuelling a new wave of elephant slaughter. \n",
      "Following a decline in the 1990s, poaching of the world’s largest land mammal has risen dramatically and in 2012 an estimated 15,000 elephants were illegally killed at 42 sites in Africa monitored by MIKE - the U.N.-backed programme for Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants. \n",
      "Since 2010, elephant poaching levels in Africa have exceeded 5 percent of the total population - a tipping point because killings are now outpacing the animals’ birth rate. \n",
      "In a related trend, the killing of rhinos for their horns - used in traditional medicine in Vietnam and China - has also soared, notably in South Africa, home to the vast majority of the animals. \n",
      "According to South African government statistics, as of Dec. 19, a record 946 rhinos had been poached in the country in 2013, compared to 668 in all of 2012. \n",
      "The report found a striking link between infant mortality rates - measured by the number of deaths of infants under one year old per 10,000 live births - and the illegal killing of elephants. \n",
      "“Human infant mortality, which is interpreted as a proxy for poverty, is the single strongest site-level correlate ... with sites suffering from higher levels of poverty experiencing higher levels of elephant poaching,” the report said. \n",
      "The relationship between poverty and poaching - in Africa and elsewhere - has long been assumed because wildlife is a source of food or money for impoverished rural dwellers. \n",
      "But links between measurements of poverty and living standards, such as infant mortality, and the illicit killing of elephants, have not been made before with the kind of clarity that researchers have found in the data over the past two years. \n",
      "Julian Blanc, a co-author of the study and acting coordinator for MIKE, told Reuters infant mortality was the best barometer for poverty because data for it, based on work by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network, exists at local levels. \n",
      "It can therefore be linked to localised incidents of elephant poaching, making it far more useful than other measurements such as per capita GDP, which can give a skewed picture, especially in countries with high levels of inequality. \n",
      "Ziama in Guinea, Niassa in Mozambique, and Bangassou in Central African Republic were the three areas covered in the report with the highest rates of infant mortality, ranging from 1,240 to almost 1,400 deaths per 10,000 live births. \n",
      "All three areas also had extremely high levels of elephant poaching. In the case of Ziama, its elephant population is small but has been reduced by over half in the past few years. \n",
      "The next four areas in the infant mortality rankings were all found in Democratic Republic of Congo. \n",
      "The report also found, using Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, that at the national level “high poaching levels are more prevalent in countries where governance is weaker, and vice versa”. \n",
      "Poverty and governance are the “enabling” factors for poaching, with consumer demand the other key link in the chain. \n",
      "Poor governance and high poverty levels overlap between countries such as Congo and Central African Republic, which are also areas where local people see little value in elephant populations. \n",
      "“In many parts of Africa people living with elephants derive no benefits from that coexistence and only bear costs in terms of crop damage, injury or death,” Blanc said in a telephone interview from his Nairobi base. \n",
      "TROPICAL, LAND-LOCKED \n",
      "Many of these countries - such as Central African Republic - also suffer from the development curses of having tropical climates, which impose the heavy disease burden seen in their infant mortality rates, and being landlocked, which imposes economic costs. \n",
      "Still, that does not mean that wildlife in such places could not be utilised in a way that might bring economic benefits. Heavily forested and tropical Gabon, for example, is building a wildlife tourist industry aimed at the more adventurous. \n",
      "But elsewhere in central Africa, elephants, a natural resource that could lift rural economies in the form of eco-tourism, or even a regulated ivory trade down the road, are being exterminated, depriving future generations of potential income. \n",
      "Such poverty traps serve as a sobering reminder, against the backdrop of the “Africa Rising” narrative, that much of the world’s poorest continent is still being excluded from the region’s dynamic economic growth and investment story.   (Editing by Giles Elgood)\n",

      "Oklahoma City doesn’t have to let the sting of a tough loss linger long, as the Thunder have a chance to bounce back when they host the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday. The Thunder squandered a 12-point halftime lead in a 98-94 home loss to Portland on Tuesday, just their second loss in 16 home games. The foundering Nets have lost two straight and six of seven overall, and have dropped their last four on the road. \n",
      "Oklahoma City still holds the best record in the Western Conference but it’s been relatively vulnerable lately, losing two of the last five following a nine-game winning streak. Brooklyn was never in its most recent game, trailing by as many as 32 in a 113-92 loss at San Antonio on Tuesday. “It’s embarrassing,” Nets forward Paul Pierce told reporters. “I don’t know if I’ve been a part of this many blowouts in one season already. At some point, we better have our pride. It has to come from each individual and say we’ve just had enough of this.” \n",
      "TV: 8 p.m. ET, NBA TV, YES (Brooklyn), FSN Oklahoma \n",
      "ABOUT THE NETS (10-21): Brooklyn has been plagued by injuries all season - most notably losing center Brook Lopez to a broken foot - but the Nets got some good news on the injury front when forward Andrei Kirilenko returned from a 25-game absence to record four points and two assists in 11 minutes against the Spurs. Forward Mirza Teletovic has blossomed recently, averaging 15.3 points over the past six games while shooting 44.2 percent from 3-point range. But Joe Johnson - the team’s top scorer with Lopez out at 15.5 points - has struggled of late, averaging eight points on 10-of-32 shooting over the past three contests. \n",
      "ABOUT THE THUNDER (25-6): Oklahoma City is not the same dominant team without point guard Russell Westbrook (21.3 points, seven assists, six rebounds), who will be out until after the All-Star break following arthroscopic knee surgery. The Thunder need even more from Kevin Durant (28.8 points, 8.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists), who has topped 30 points and 10 rebounds in each of the first three games of Westbrook’s latest absence. Reggie Jackson (12.5 points) has stepped into Westbrook’s spot in the lineup after playing a key role off the bench early in the season. \n",
      "1. The Thunder are 20-3 when outrebounding their opponent but lost to the Trail Blazers despite winning the battle on the boards. \n",
      "2. Durant has topped 30 points 16 times this season, most in the NBA. \n",
      "3. Brooklyn PF Andray Blatche (11.6 points, 5.9 rebounds) will miss his fourth straight game for personal reasons. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "ATLANTA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A Georgia banker who left a suicide note and vanished after being accused of embezzling $21 million in investors’ funds has been arrested by police 18 months following his disappearance. \n",
      "Sheriff’s deputies captured Aubrey Lee Price, 47, during a traffic stop on Interstate 95 near Brunswick, Georgia, on Tuesday after noticing the windows of his Dodge pickup were tinted too darkly, Glynn County Sheriff E. Neal Jump said. \n",
      "Price disappeared soon before his indictment on one count of bank fraud in July 2012 and left behind a written confession and a note for family and friends saying he planned to kill himself, authorities said. \n",
      "When he was discovered earlier this week, he had several identification cards in his truck and failed to say which one correctly identified him, Jump said. \n",
      "“The gentleman’s story just didn’t add up,” the sheriff said. \n",
      "Price was charged with giving false information and taken to jail, where he told authorities his correct name, Jump said. \n",
      "At a federal court hearing on Thursday, a U.S. magistrate judge ordered Price to remain in police custody until a detention hearing set for Monday in Savannah, court records showed. \n",
      "A U.S. Marshal told the judge that Price said he was homeless and lived as a migrant worker, accepting cash for odd jobs, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. \n",
      "Price previously controlled an investment group that put $10 million into Montgomery Bank & Trust, a small bank in Ailey, Georgia, according to the federal indictment. \n",
      "After being named a bank director, he “fraudulently obtained over $21 million of MB&T; funds, which he then misappropriated, embezzled and lost in speculative trading and other investing,” the indictment said. \n",
      "In an effort to hide the fraud, Price provided bank officials with fabricated account statements, the indictment said. Regulators later shut down the bank’s two branches. \n",
      "Before his arrest on Tuesday, Price was last seen boarding a ferry in Key West, Florida, in June 2012. Investigators at the time speculated that he either committed suicide or fled to Venezuela. \n",
      "The FBI had put him on the agency’s “Most Wanted” list and continued to search for him.\n",

      "UPDATE 1-Brazil trade surplus falls sharply in 2013\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "BRASILIA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Brazil’s trade surplus fell to its lowest level in over a decade in 2013, hurt by lower commodities prices, an increase in fuel imports and declining competitiveness among manufacturers. \n",
      "Brazil posted a trade surplus of $2.561 billion in 2013, the Trade Ministry said on Thursday. It was the country’s worst trade result since 2000 and a sharp drop from the $19.396 billion surplus posted in the previous year. \n",
      "The worsening trade balance is a serious challenge for Brazil, which is struggling with a subdued global economy and productivity shortcomings at home. The diminishing surplus has also weakened the local currency, the real, as fewer U.S. dollars enter the economy. That could lead to additional inflation pressure as imports become more costly. \n",
      "For December, Latin America’s largest economy posted a trade surplus of $2.654 billion, above the median forecast for a $1.35 billion surplus in a Reuters survey of six analysts. \n",
      "A 15.3 percent increase in manufactured goods over the previous year helped support the trade balance in December, with the largest portion of that attributed to the $1.2 billion export of an oil rig. \n",
      "That oil rig, however, was sold by state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, to one of its foreign subsidiaries and will likely remain in Brazil. \n",
      "Petrobras obtains certain tax and other benefits by registering its ships and offshore oil rigs in the Netherlands, and any transfer of ownership out of Brazil is accounted for as an export. \n",
      "Imports reached a record $239.6 billion in 2013, a 6.5 percent increase over the previous year, the trade ministry said. In contrast, exports fell 1 percent to $242.2 billion. \n",
      "President Dilma Rousseff’s government has offered billions of dollars in subsidized lending to help exporters, mostly those who produce finished goods. Still, Brazilian manufacturers have struggled to remain competitive with their global peers due to a heavy tax burden, high labor costs and poor infrastructure. \n",
      "Raw materials such soy, corn and iron-ore accounted for about half of total exports from Brazil last year, though the country is earning less for some of those products as prices on global markets decline. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index  of the 19 most-traded agricultural, energy and metals commodities fell 5 percent in 2013. \n",
      "Imports, on the other hand, remain robust even after the real weakened a little over 13 percent against the U.S. dollar last year. \n",
      "A big part of that is fuel, with the country’s limited refining capacity requiring costly shipments from abroad. The total value of fuel and lubricant imports rose 13.8 percent in 2013 from the previous year, while intermediate goods rose 5.8 percent and capital goods rose 5.4 percent. \n",
      "Brazilians’ appetite for foreign products has also remained strong, bolstering imports of consumer goods such as electronics and clothes by 3.2 percent in the year.\n",

      "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Sunni Muslim fighters clashed on Thursday with Iraqi troops trying to regain control of two western cities, in a serious escalation of their confrontation with the Shi’ite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. \n",
      "Tension has been running high in the Sunni-dominated province of Anbar since Iraqi police broke up a Sunni protest camp on Monday, leaving at least 13 people dead. \n",
      "Thousands of anti-government tribal fighters took over local government buildings in the two main cities, Falluja and Ramadi, on Wednesday after the army pulled back in an attempt to calm the situation. \n",
      "Fighting broke out on Thursday, tribal leaders and security officials said, when the army tried to re-enter the cities. \n",
      "“The tribesmen are now fighting the army. What is the army doing in our city and why did they come?,” Sheikh Adnan al-Mehana, the head of one of the biggest tribes in Anbar, told Reuters from Ramadi by telephone. \n",
      "“Today, we defeated the army and if another force will be sent, we are ready for them,” he said. \n",
      "Eyewitnesses said tribal fighters had formed a new group known as the Tribal Revolutionaries. They placed snipers on the tops of houses overlooking the highway leading to Ramadi after evacuating them to prevent the army from coming back. \n",
      "“There are heavily reinforced troops who were sent (by Baghdad), and the tribesmen are now deployed around the city to fight these troops and cut off their way,” said a prominent tribal sheikh who declined to be named. \n",
      "“We cannot let this army enter our cities. They are (Shi’ite) militias, not a national army, and they are loyal to Maliki, not to the Iraqi people.” \n",
      "Local security officials said the tribal snipers had so far kept the army troops away and forced them to retreat. \n",
      "Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda have also stormed police stations in Anbar, seizing weapons caches, freeing dozens of prisoners and burning down the stations after chasing out the police and letting looters in. \n",
      "Anbar tribal leaders said talks between tribesmen and Islamist militants were taking place, to keep the al Qaeda insurgents away from the fighting. \n",
      "“We are looking to prevent the government from using excessive power against us by using the excuse of al Qaeda’s presence,” a senior Anbar tribal leader who is familiar with the negotiations told Reuters by phone. \n",
      "Sunni anger at the Shi’ite-led government’s crushing of a protest movement has inflamed Iraq’s deep-seated sectarian tensions. The dismantled camp in Anbar had been an irritant to Maliki since it was set up a year ago by Sunnis protesting against what they see as the marginalizing of their sect. \n",
      "Mnay of Iraq’s minority Sunnis, who held most positions of power under the late Saddam Hussein, are resentful of Shi’ite dominance since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled him in 2003 and led to elections that shifted the balance in favor of the majority sect. \n",
      "A Sunni tribe in Anbar threatened to “set Iraq on fire” if Maliki’s government does not free Ahmed al-Alwani, a prominent Sunni lawmaker from the Iraqiya bloc, who was arrested on Saturday on terrorism charges. \n",
      "“Our main demand is releasing Ahmed. We will set the province and Iraq on fire if he is not released by tonight,” tribal leader sheikh al-Mehana said. \n",

      "4 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - The California Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that an undocumented Mexican immigrant should be licensed to practice law in a closely watched case on immigration rights. \n",
      "The unanimous ruling in favor of Sergio Garcia came after California legislators passed a bill last year that specifically authorized the high court to allow qualified applicants into the state bar, regardless of their immigration status. \n",
      "California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye wrote that current immigration policy makes it “extremely unlikely” that a law abiding individual such as Garcia would be deported. \n",
      "“Under these circumstances, we conclude that the fact that an undocumented immigrant’s presence in this country violates federal statutes is not itself a sufficient or persuasive basis for denying undocumented immigrants, as a class, admission to the State Bar,” she wrote. \n",
      "A U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment, and attorneys for Garcia could not immediately be reached. Nicholas Pacilio, a spokesman for California Attorney General Kamala Harris, applauded the decision. \n",
      "“California’s success has hinged on the hard work and self-sufficiency of immigrants like Sergio,” Pacilio said. \n",
      "Last year the Democratic-led U.S. Senate approved a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants living in the United States illegally, but the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has not yet taken up the legislation. \n",
      "Meanwhile, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a series of immigrant rights bills last October. In addition to the legislation paving the way for the state Supreme Court to authorize undocumented immigrants for the bar, other new laws prohibit law enforcement officials from detaining immigrants based on federal government instructions - except in cases of serious crimes or convictions - and make it illegal for employers to retaliate against workers on the basis of their citizenship. \n",
      "Garcia was an infant when he came to the United States and lived here until the age of 8 or 9 and then returned with his family to his native Mexico. At 17, Garcia reentered the United States with his father, who was then a permanent U.S. resident and later became a citizen. \n",
      "His father filed a petition seeking an immigrant visa for Garcia in 1995. Garcia is still waiting to receive the visa, which would allow him to seek permanent residency and ultimately citizenship. Garcia earned a law degree from Cal Northern School of Law in Chico, California, north of Sacramento, and passed the state bar exam. \n",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice had argued in legal filings that even if Garcia obtained a license, he still wouldn’t be allowed to be paid as a lawyer in many circumstances. Yet Cantil-Sakauye wrote that those concerns shouldn’t stop Garcia from becoming an attorney in the first place. \n",
      "That an individual is in the U.S. without legal authorization does not “demonstrate moral unfitness,” Cantil-Sakauye wrote, “or prevent the individual from taking an oath promising faithfully to discharge the duty to support the Constitution and laws of the United States and California.” \n",
      "The case in the California Supreme Court is In re Sergio C. Garcia on Admission, S202512. \n",

      "Jihad Jane: Despite cooperation, U.S. seeks 'decades' in prison\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pennsylvania woman who called herself Jihad Jane and a teenage accomplice from Maryland provided “very significant” assistance to U.S. authorities in several terrorism investigations but still remains a threat to the public, prosecutors say in new court filings. \n",
      "Prosecutors said Colleen LaRose, 50, should be sentenced to “decades behind bars” for her role in a failed 2009 plot to kill Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who offended many Muslims by drawing the Prophet Mohammed on the head of a dog. \n",
      "After years of delay, the American-born LaRose is expected to be sentenced on Monday in Philadelphia. A similar hearing for Mohammad Hassan Khalid, the youngest person ever charged with terrorism in the United States, is set for Tuesday. \n",
      "U.S. guidelines call for LaRose to receive a life sentence and for Khalid, who is now 20, to receive 15 years. Given their cooperation, prosecutors asked the judge to sentence LaRose to “decades behind bars” and Khalid to “less than 10 years.” \n",
      "In a presentence filing this week, U.S. authorities reiterated what they declared when LaRose’s arrest was made public in 2010 - that her gender, blond hair, Texas twang and green eyes make her case significant because she does not fit the stereotype of an Islamic terrorist. \n",
      "“News of LaRose’s arrest spread shockwaves throughout the West, as people recognized that the face of the terrorism threat had changed forever,” prosecutors Jennifer Arbittier Williams and Matthew Blue wrote. “The world is watching, and this sentencing presents an important opportunity to send a strong message to other lonely, vulnerable people who might be enticed by online extremists promising fame and honor.” \n",
      "A 2012 Reuters investigative report (reut.rs/1eqk6sJ) \n",
      "described LaRose’s troubled life before she converted to Islam: childhood rapes by her biological father, teenage prostitution, heavy drug abuse and failed marriages. LaRose said that her father’s sexual assaults, confirmed by confidential court records, began in second grade. \n",
      "“I survived a lot of things that should have rightfully have killed me,” LaRose said in an exclusive interview from jail in 2012. \n",
      "LaRose’s story has helped prosecutors and FBI agents better understand the roots of homegrown extremism, U.S. officials said. \n",
      "LaRose was living with a oft-travelling boyfriend in 2007 when a romantic encounter with a Muslim man sparked an interest in Islam. After months of learning online, LaRose said, she converted to Islam and later watched videos of alleged U.S. and Israeli atrocities against Palestinian children that radicalized her. \n",
      "By 2008, prosecutors said, “she had managed to align herself with violent terrorists who valued her ability and persistence as their online predator, or ‘hunter,’” recruiting new fighters. \n",
      "“I just loved my brothers so much, when they would tell me stuff, I would listen to them, no matter what,” LaRose told Reuters. “And I also was ... lost.” \n",
      "In 2009, LaRose followed instructions from an al Qaeda operative in Pakistan and flew to Europe for the plot to kill the Swedish artist. But after six weeks, largely in Ireland, LaRose became frustrated with the mission’s pace and returned to Philadelphia, where she was arrested. \n",
      "Ali Damache, her alleged handler in Ireland, remains jailed there, fighting extradition to the United States on terrorism charges. Jamie Paulin Ramirez, who flew from Colorado to marry Damache in Ireland, pleaded guilty to related terrorism charges. She may be sentenced on Wednesday. \n",
      "Prosecutors said Khalid, who grew up in Pakistan, lived a double-life after moving to Maryland - as “a polite and studious 15-year-old” and “a tireless soldier for violent jihad.” He helped al Qaeda by translating videos from Urdu to English, inciting others, and aided LaRose as she smuggled a stolen U.S. passport to a terrorist, they said. \n",
      "After pleading guilty, LaRose and Khalid each met more than 20 times with U.S. authorities, providing information about multiple targets. In particular, authorities cited Khalid’s insight into al Qaeda’s propaganda and recruitment efforts. \n",
      "LaRose’s lawyer, Mark Wilson, could not be reached on Wednesday. Khalid’s lawyer, Jeffrey Lindy, declined to comment. But documents in the case show the lawyers will cite deep mitigating psychological issues as they argue for shorter sentences. \n",
      "For his part, the intended victim said in 2012 that LaRose has served enough time. “They should let her go,” Vilks said. \n",

      "The Philadelphia Flyers attempt to extend their season-high winning streak to five games as they continue their road trip Thursday against the Colorado Avalanche. Philadelphia posted a home triumph over Minnesota on Dec. 23 before beginning its six-game trek with three wins, the most recent being a 4-1 victory at Calgary on Tuesday. Brayden Schenn scored the tying goal with 47 seconds remaining in the third period in a 4-3 shootout triumph at Vancouver on Monday before recording the game-winning tally and two assists against the Flames. \n",
      "Colorado is in the midst of a seven-game homestand during which it has earned three of a possible four points thus far. The Avalanche opened the stretch with a 2-1 shootout loss to Winnipeg on Sunday before Ryan O’Reilly and rookie Nathan MacKinnon each registered a goal and an assist in a 5-3 triumph over Columbus two nights later. Colorado is 3-0-2 in its last five contests at Pepsi Center. \n",

      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A U.S. watchdog on Thursday recommended the government change how it issues market-sensitive data, specifically weekly jobless claims figures, in a move that could end the process of releasing certain economic snapshots through the media. \n",
      "The recommendation was included in an audit released on Thursday by the Labor Department’s Office of Inspector General. The panel was reviewing the process in an effort to prevent the possibility of traders or anyone working inside the so-called lockups from having an unfair competitive advantage. \n",
      "Lockups are used by the government to release market-sensitive data to the public. During a lockup, media outlets receive embargoed copies of data reports and are “locked” in a media room without the ability to post headlines and stories until the embargo is lifted. \n",
      "The inspector general suggested that the Labor Department tighten lockup rules and procedures, or scrap them altogether. \n",
      "In addition to the unemployment numbers, the lockup process, in use at several news outlets, covers releases on economic growth, home sales and inflation, among other things. \n",
      "The lockups allow media outlets to sell data reports to clients, including high-frequency, or algorithmic, trading firms. The firms use computerized trading techniques ahead of individual traders based on the reports. \n",
      "“Algorithmic trading introduces new security variables into a lockup system not originally designed to guard against market-moving distributions that could be caused by the release of government data to certain traders just seconds before the rest of the general public,” the report said. \n",
      "“A few years ago, a few seconds here or there would not have had much of an impact. Today, fractions of a second can equate to millions or even billions of dollars in market movements.” \n",
      "The report also found that the Employment and Training Administration, which compiles the jobless claim report, had deficiencies in its procedures governing release of the data. \n",
      "The audit was mainly focused on the department’s weekly report on jobless claims, but the panel’s recommendations could have a broader impact on how other government agencies consider cracking down on lockups. \n",
      "In response to the report, the Labor Department said in a statement: “We agree with the OIG that it is appropriate to consider ending the (unemployment insurance) weekly claims press lockup.” \n",
      "The Department said it had already started exploring the value of the press lockup and intends to continue its consideration of how best to disseminate the report to both the public and to news organizations. \n",
      "The Labor Department said it agrees with some of the issues the audit raised surrounding the efficacy of the lockup process. \n",
      "Many government officials have already considered potential security problems and have tightened procedures this past year to ensure there are not any broken embargoes.    (Reporting by Margaret Chadbourn; Editing by Dan Grebler)\n",

      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on their first day of trading in 2014 as investors booked profits in the wake of the S&P; 500’s best yearly advance since 1997, with many of last year’s strongest performers down on the day. \n",
      "All 10 S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with tech among the biggest drags after Wells Fargo downgraded Apple Inc to “market perform” from “outperform,” saying the company’s market cap had limited upside potential without material market share gains. \n",
      "Apple fell 1.4 percent to $553.13 and was the biggest drag on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes. The S&P; technology index fell 1.1 percent. \n",
      "Adding to the weakness in the group were stocks that had enjoyed the best gains in 2013, including Netflix, which was down 1.5 percent at $362.82, and Micron Tech Inc , which was off 0.4 percent at $21.66. Both names more than tripled last year. \n",
      "“There’s no fundamental underpinning to the decline today, just basic portfolio rebalancing on the first day of a new tax year,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Global Investments. “People are taking profits and seeking bargains.” \n",
      "Almost two-thirds of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed lower while 61 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares closed down. \n",

      "* MV Cape Ray readied with hydrolysis units, modular housing \n",
      "* Ship will carry three times its normal number of personnel \n",
      "* Syria agreed to destroy arms under threat of U.S. military action \n",
      "By David Alexander \n",
      "PORTSMOUTH, Va., Jan 2 (Reuters) - The U.S.-owned cargo ship with the capability to destroy the nastiest of Syria’s chemical weapons will depart for the Mediterranean in about two weeks, officials said on Thursday as shipyard workers readied the vessel for new sea trials. \n",
      "Forklifts moved equipment and sparks flew as workers welded containers and other gear on the deck of the MV Cape Ray, which is being outfitted with modular housing to accommodate three times it normal complement of personnel, plus two hydrolysis units for destroying Syrian chemicals used in mustard and nerve gas weapons. \n",
      "“Without this ship, this mission is not possible,” top Pentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall, who has oversight of chemical, biological and nuclear arms, told reporters who were invited to tour the vessel at dock in Portsmouth, Virginia. \n",
      "“This avoids having to put these materials on somebody’s territory, where you have to deal with all the political and environmental conditions associated with doing that under local law,” he said. \n",
      "Damascus agreed to eliminate its chemical weapons last year in the face of threatened U.S. military action following a Syrian chemical attack against rebels and their supporters in a civil war aimed at overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad. \n",
      "The United States had developed a portable machine for destroying chemical weapons precursors and offered to neutralize the portion of Syria’s agents that were too toxic to be dealt with directly by companies that process hazardous materials. \n",
      "Syria failed to meet the Dec. 31 deadline for removing the chemical agents, but officials have noted that the time frame was always going to be challenging and arms control experts say deliberate and safe handling of the materials is more important than doing it speedily. \n",
      "“This operation is difficult but it’s do-able,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. “It’s safe and it should be done carefully, and that’s more important than doing it quickly.” \n",
      "Kendall said the Cape Ray, which is part of the Maritime Administration’s Reserve Ready Fleet of cargo ships is expected to leave for the Mediterranean “within about two weeks.” \n",
      "Security concerns and bureaucracy have caused Assad’s government to miss Tuesday’s deadline for the removal of deadly toxins from Syria. Bad weather and a complex multinational procurement effort for equipment are among other reasons given for the delay. \n",
      "The United States is not overly concerned about the delay. \n",
      "“If you think six months ago they didn’t even admit they had chemical weapons, now we have a massive international effort to destroy them and we’ve seen progress,” State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. “I think we’re getting there.” \n",
      "The chemical weapons will be taken from the Syrian port of Latakia to a port in Italy where they will be loaded onto the Cape Ray and destroyed in international waters. \n",
      "Rick Jordan, the Cape Ray’s civilian captain, said the ship had undergone sea trials last week to prove it was ready for the voyage after a period of inactivity. Additional sea trials are planned for next week to test the hydrolysis system while under way and to train the crew for possible emergencies. \n",
      "“We have not tested this on board yet,” he said, motioning to arched tents on the Cape Ray’s lower deck where two Defense Department Field Deployable Hydrolysis Systems have been installed. \n",
      "The ship is expecting to destroy about 700 tons of chemical weapons precursor agents, Kendall said. The actual work could probably be done in 45 days under ideal conditions, but the mission is expected to last about 90 days because work will be suspended in bad weather, he said. \n",
      "The hydrolysis process uses water and other reagents like sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite to neutralize bulk amounts of chemical warfare agents, according to the Defense Department’s Edgewood Chemical Biological Center. \n",
      "The chemically altered agents can then be processed by commercial firms that deal with hazardous waste. Officials said the 700 tons of chemicals, when run through the hydrolysis system, would produce 1.5 million gallons of effluents to be processed by hazardous waste firms.

      "© 2018 Reuters. All Rights Reserved.China denounces U.S. for sending Uighur 'terrorists' to Slovakia\n",
      "\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Foreign Ministry criticized the United States on Thursday for sending the last three Uighur Chinese inmates at the Guantanamo Bay detention center to Slovakia, saying they were “terrorists” who posed a real security danger. \n",
      "Yusef Abbas, Saidullah Khalik, and Hajiakbar Abdul Ghuper are the last of 22 Muslim minority Chinese nationals to be moved from the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba, according to the Pentagon. \n",
      "Slovakia’s Interior Ministry confirmed that it would take in the three. Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim people from China’s far western region of Xinjiang. \n",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the three were members of the separatist East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which Beijing labels a terrorist group. \n",
      "“They are genuine terrorists. They not only threaten China’s security, they will threaten the security of the country that receives them,” he told a daily news briefing. \n",
      "“China hopes that the relevant country ... does not give asylum to terrorists, and sends them back to China as soon as possible.” \n",
      "Qin added that China did not appreciate a recent U.S. State Department call for Chinese security forces to exercise restraint following the latest outbreak of violence in Xinjiang, also blamed by Beijing on “terrorists”. \n",
      "“These remarks neglect the facts and are feeble,” he said. “We urge the United States to abandon their double standards when it comes to terrorism, and immediately stop saying one thing and doing another, to avoid sending the wrong message to violent terrorist forces.” \n",
      "The United States said it was grateful to Slovakia for its “humanitarian gesture.” \n",
      "Most of the Uighurs at Guantanamo were captured near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in late 2001, and were believed to have trained with the Taliban. U.S. officials have deemed they pose no threat to the United States. \n",
      "In 2008, a U.S. court ordered that they be released. They have been resettled in El Salvador, Switzerland, Bermuda, Albania, and the Pacific island nation of Palau. \n",
      "The U.S. government has said it will not return the Uighurs to China because they would face persecution there. \n",
      "“We’ve long maintained our position that we will not repatriate Uighurs to China from Guantanamo due to our humane treatment policies,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said at a briefing in Washington on Thursday. \n",
      "“We remain deeply concerned about discrimination and restrictions placed on Uighurs and other Muslims in China,” she said. \n",
      "Many Uighurs chafe at restrictions on their culture, language and religion, though the Chinese government insists it grants them broad freedoms. \n",
      "The region has been beset by violence with at least 91 people, including several police, killed in unrest in Xinjiang since April, according to state media reports. \n",
      "China has blamed some of the violence on Islamist militants with connections to foreign groups, including al Qaeda, plotting holy war. \n",
      "Many rights groups and exiles say China exaggerates the militant threat to justify its firm grip on energy-rich Xinjiang, which abuts Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. \n",

      "Euro zone factories end 2013 on a high, but France a worry: PMIs\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing grew at the fastest rate since mid-2011 in December on brisk business in Germany and Italy, setting the stage for a solid start to the year after a tumultuous 2013, a survey showed on Thursday. \n",
      "Markit’s Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 52.7 in December from November’s 51.6, confirming an early estimate and marking its best reading in 31 months. \n",
      "Readings above 50 indicate growth in activity. \n",
      "New orders piled in at the fastest pace since April 2011, and a near two-year stretch of job cuts across euro zone factories almost came to an end last month. \n",
      "Looking at individual countries in the region, the mood was largely positive, with the exception of France. Manufacturing activity in the euro zone’s No.2 economy hit a six-month nadir last month. \n",
      "“With producers reporting further growth of new orders, exports and backlogs of work, the stage is set for a good start to 2014,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the PMIs. \n",
      "“It seems likely that the manufacturing sector will help drive a meaningful, albeit still modest, recovery in the wider economy.” \n",
      "Williamson also noted that prices in manufacturing companies are starting to rise slightly, suggesting firms are seeing some improvement in pricing power. \n",
      "The weakness of euro zone inflation, at just 0.9 percent in November, has caused concern among policymakers at the European Central Bank. The latest PMIs suggest that disinflationary forces from manufacturing, at least, may have peaked. \n",
      "Markit said the December PMIs were consistent with production growing at a quarterly rate of 1 percent. \n",
      "However, even with struggling Italy and Spain showing signs of a much brighter year ahead, the region’s recovery may be hobbled by a sickly French manufacturing base. \n",
      "“While Germany, Italy and Spain are seeing the strongest output growth since early 2011, buoyed to varying degrees by improved export sales, France is seeing a steepening downturn, in part the result of widening export losses,” said Williamson. \n",
      "“This suggests that competitiveness is a key issue which the French manufacturing sector needs to address to catch up with its peers.” \n",

      "* Parlimentary committee concerned about money, lack of data \n",
      "By Kate Kelland \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - British lawmakers on Friday criticised government spending of 424 million pounds ($702 million) to stockpile Roche’s medicine Tamiflu, saying doubts about the drug’s effectiveness suggest it may not be money well spent. \n",
      "Parliament’s influential Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said it was “surprised and concerned” to discover that information on methods and results of clinical trials of such prescribed drugs “is routinely withheld”, and said there was a “lack of consensus over how well Tamiflu ... actually works”. \n",
      "“The case for stockpiling antiviral medicines at the current level is based on judgment rather than on evidence of their effectiveness during an influenza pandemic,” said Richard Bacon, a leading member of the committee. \n",
      "He added that as well as spending more than 420 million pounds on stockpiling Tamiflu, an antiviral medicine, the Department of Health was forced to write off 74 million pounds of that as a result of poor record-keeping by the National Health Service. \n",
      "“Before spending money in future to maintain the stockpile the (health) department needs to review what level of coverage is appropriate,” he said. \n",
      "Tamiflu has been approved by regulators worldwide and is stockpiled by many governments in case of a global flu outbreak. Sales of the drug hit close to $3 billion in 2009, due to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, although they have since declined. \n",
      "But some researchers claim there is little evidence Tamiflu works and have lobbied since 2009 for Swiss drugmaker Roche to hand over all its data from clinical trials of the medicine. \n",
      "After a lengthy fight, Roche agreed last year that it would hand over the data to outside researchers at the Cochrane Collaboration, a non-profit group that reviews trial data to assess the value of drugs. \n",
      "The PAC said it was “extremely concerning that there has been a five-year delay and that there continues to be a lack of clarity” over whether medicines regulators and safety authorities had access to full trial results. \n",
      "Beyond the Tamiflu situation, the committee said it was concerned that information on methods and results of clinical trials is routinely and legally withheld. \n",
      "“This longstanding regulatory and cultural failure impacts on all of medicine, and undermines the ability of clinicians, researchers and patients to make informed decisions about which treatment is best,” it said in its report. \n",
      "The PAC report forms part of a wider debate about access to data from clinical trials conducted by the pharmaceutical industry to test the efficacy of and win marketing approval for new drugs. Critics say drugmakers routinely hide or bury trial data which is unfavourable. \n",
      "Tracey Brown, director of a group called Sense About Science, which a year ago launched AllTrials - a campaign fighting for all data from all trials of all prescribed drugs  to be made available - said the PAC report “adds to the clamour of voices” calling for more transparency in the drug industry. \n",
      "“There is no excuse for not publishing results, but a huge public benefit to having a complete picture of what was found in trials conducted on treatments currently available to patients,” she said.\n",

      "UPDATE 1-Fugitive U.S. banker arrested after 18 months on run\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "By David Beasley \n",
      "ATLANTA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A former Georgia bank director who left a suicide note and vanished while under suspicion he embezzled $21 million has been captured 18 months after he disappeared. \n",
      "Sheriff’s deputies arrested Aubrey Lee Price, 47, during a traffic stop on Interstate 95 near Brunswick, Georgia, on Tuesday after noticing the windows of his Dodge pickup appeared to be tinted too darkly to comply with state law, Glynn County Sheriff E. Neal Jump said. \n",
      "Price disappeared soon before his indictment in Georgia on one count of bank fraud in July 2012 and left behind a written confession and a note for family and friends saying he planned to kill himself, authorities said. \n",
      "When he was discovered earlier this week, he had several identification cards in his truck and failed to say which one correctly identified him, Jump said. \n",
      "“The gentleman’s story just didn’t add up,” the sheriff said. \n",
      "Price was charged with giving false information and taken to jail, where he told authorities his correct name, Jump said. \n",
      "At a federal court hearing on Thursday, a U.S. magistrate judge ordered Price to remain in police custody until a detention hearing set for Monday in Savannah, court records showed. \n",
      "A U.S. marshal told the judge that Price said he was homeless and lived as a migrant worker, accepting cash for odd jobs, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. \n",
      "The bank fraud charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. \n",
      "Price previously controlled an investment group that put $10 million into Montgomery Bank & Trust, a small bank in Ailey, Georgia, according to the federal indictment. \n",
      "After being named a bank director, he “fraudulently obtained over $21 million of MB&T; funds, which he then misappropriated, embezzled and lost in speculative trading and other investing,” the indictment said. \n",
      "In an effort to hide the fraud, Price provided bank officials with fabricated account statements, the indictment said. Regulators later shut down the bank’s two branches. \n",
      "He was indicted in New York last year on securities and wire fraud charges connected to the scheme. \n",
      "Before his arrest on Tuesday, Price was last seen boarding a ferry in Key West, Florida, in June 2012. Investigators at the time speculated that he either committed suicide or fled to Venezuela. \n",
      "The FBI had put him on the agency’s “Most Wanted” list and continued to search for him. \n",
      "Price’s wife believed he was dead, her attorney said on Thursday. She asked a Florida judge to declare her husband deceased last year for estate planning purposes and now will seek to have the declaration set aside, lawyer John Holt said. \n",
      "Rebeka Price does not know where her husband spent the last 18 months, Holt said. \n",
      "“She’s been completely in the dark,” the lawyer said.\n",

      "Samsung Electronics drops 5 percent on weak earnings outlook, soaring won\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd fell more than 5 percent on Thursday to its lowest in over four months, weighed down by analysts’ forecasts of lower quarterly earnings due to the strong won currency and weaker margins at its display business. \n",
      "Shares fell as much as 5.1 percent on Thursday to 1.302 million won, the lowest since late August. The stock closed down 4.6 percent, its fifth consecutive session of decline, a downtrend that has wiped nearly $18 billion off the market value of Asia’s most valuable company. \n",
      "Samsung, the world’s largest maker of smartphones, memory chips and televisions, is scheduled to report its October-December quarter earnings estimate next Tuesday. \n",
      "The company is forecast to report a record 10.3 trillion won of operating profit in the October-December quarter, a one percent increase from the previous quarter, according to an average estimate of 40 analysts by the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \n",
      "But Starmine SmartEstimate, the average of the most accurate analysts’ estimates, forecasts a 3.6 percent quarter-on-quarter drop in Samsung’s operating profit to 9.9 trillion won. \n",
      "“We expect Samsung’s performance to be about 9.5 trillion won, lower than the market consensus of around 10.2 trillion won. The biggest reason would be the won-dollar exchange rate, followed by shrinking margins in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) sales,” said Lee Seung-woo, tech analyst at IBK Investment & Securities. \n",
      "A stronger won is particularly bad for the profitability of Samsung’s component business as the unit mainly uses the U.S. dollar for settlement, analysts said. \n",
      "The won jumped to its highest since mid-2008 on Thursday and market participants expect further gains as recent data pointed towards a firm economic recovery. \n",
      "BNP Paribas analyst Peter Yu, one of the more bearish analysts about Samsung’s earnings, estimates the operating profit of the component business to change 4 percent for every 1 percent change in the won/dollar rate. \n",
      "He also estimates Samsung’s fourth-quarter profit to fall by 14 percent from the previous quarter to 8.8 trillion won due to a stronger won, a one-off special bonus payment and weaker sales of smartphone components. \n",
      "The won’s rally has also dealt a blow to other major exporters, with shares of Hyundai Motor Co tumbling 5.1 percent and Kia Motors Co losing 6.1 percent. \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - Former world number one Rory McIlroy feels like he has his mojo back and wants to win two major championships this year to make up for a poor season in 2013. \n",
      "The young Northern Irishman ruled the golfing roost in 2012, winning five titles, but a change of equipment and some off-course legal distractions coincided with a slump in form that has seen him slide to sixth in the rankings. \n",
      "McIlroy ended a 12-month drought by landing last month’s Australian Open title and he said that victory had restored his belief going into the new season. \n",
      "“I feel that my game is really coming back, going down to Australia and winning,” the 24-year-old told the BBC. \n",
      "“Beating (world number two) Adam Scott down there was really nice and while it doesn’t make up for the other weeks during the year, it gives me some momentum for 2014. \n",
      "“I won a major in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013 so I’ll try to make up for that with two this year.” \n",
      "McIlroy, who announced his engagement to former world number one tennis player Caroline Wozniacki earlier this week, said he was learning to handle the pressure of competing for golf’s top prizes. \n",
      "“I’m so much better down the stretch and so much better under pressure than I used to be,” he said. \n",
      "“If I give myself a chance in these tournaments I know I’ll have a great opportunity to win. I feel I am very close, I’m confident with my game and confident where it’s going,” added McIlroy who won the U.S. Open in 2011 and the U.S. PGA Championship a year later. \n",
      "“I didn’t have the greatest of seasons in 2013 but I feel like I’ll definitely make up for that in 2014.” \n",

      "Wal-Mart recalls donkey product in China after fox meat scandal\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world’s largest retailer, has recalled donkey meat sold at some outlets in China after tests showed the product contained the DNA of other animals, the U.S. company said. \n",
      "Wal-Mart will reimburse customers who bought the tainted “Five Spice” donkey meat and is helping local food and industry agencies in eastern Shandong province investigate its Chinese supplier, it said late on Wednesday in official posts on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. The Shandong Food and Drug Administration earlier said the product contained fox meat. \n",
      "The scandal could dent Wal-Mart’s reputation for quality in China’s $1 trillion food and grocery market where it plans to open 110 new stores in the next few years. China is the largest grocery market in the world and is set to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2016, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution. \n",
      "“This is another hit on Wal-Mart’s brand, meaning wealthy shoppers will start to lose the trust they had before,” said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research (CMR) Group. CMR estimates Wal-Mart’s market share fell from 7.5 percent to 5.2 percent over the last three years. \n",
      "Donkey meat is a popular snack in some areas of China, although it only accounts for a tiny fraction of overall meat consumption. In 2011 China slaughtered 2.4 million donkeys, according to country’s livestock industry yearbook. \n",
      "Wal-Mart, French grocer Carrefour SA, McDonald’s Corp and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc among others, have come under fire before in China over food safety issues, a sensitive topic in a country riddled with scares from a fatal tainted milk scandal to recycled “gutter oil” used for cooking. \n",
      "Wal-Mart said it had set up an investigation team to look into the incident, would strengthen food safety rules and take legal action against the product supplier. It added the person in charge at the supplier factory had already been detained. \n",
      "“We are deeply sorry for this whole affair,” said Wal-Mart’s China president and CEO, Greg Foran. “It is a deep lesson (for us) that we need to continue to increase investment in supplier management.” \n",
      "The U.S. retailer has had a troubled past in China. In 2011, China fined Wal-Mart, along with Carrefour, a combined 9.5 million yuan ($1.57 million) for manipulating product prices. Wal-Mart was also fined that year in China for selling duck meat past its expiry date. \n",
      "Food safety scandals can have a significant impact in China. Yum has struggled to recover sales in China more than a year after a chicken supplier to KFC in the country was found to have used excess levels of antibiotics. Analysts, though, said the impact of the current scare would be far more subdued. \n",
      "Wal-Mart, which operates more than 400 facilities in China, competes with market leaders Sun Art Retail Group Ltd and China Resources Enterprise Ltd, which in August teamed up with British retailer Tesco Plc. \n",
      "Consumers on popular microblogging site Sina Weibo were at a loss whether to criticize Wal-Mart or support it. Online sentiment can spread quickly in China where there is a high proportion of social media users. \n",
      "“Isn’t fox meat more expensive than donkey meat anyway?” asked one bemused user. \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Janet Yellen came a step closer to final approval as the Federal Reserve’s next chair after the U.S. Senate set a Monday vote on President Barack Obama’s choice to succeed Ben Bernanke. \n",
      "The Senate is expected to vote at around 5:30 p.m. EST Monday on Yellen, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. \n",
      "Yellen, who would become the first woman to chair the U.S. central bank, would take the reins on February 1, one day after Bernanke ends a two-term stint during which he reached deep into the Fed’s monetary toolbox to try to revive an economy hit by a massive financial crisis that sent it into the worst downturn in decades. \n",
      "Yellen has been deeply involved in the decisions to press the Fed into uncharted monetary policy waters, as the Fed’s vice chair since 2010 and before that as chief of the San Francisco Fed. \n",
      "As she steps into her new role, her biggest challenge will likely be to begin to pare back the Fed’s crisis-era stimulus. The bank took a first step in that direction last month when policymakers voted to pare its massive bond-buying stimulus program to $75 billion a month from $85 billion. \n",
      "The Senate on December 20 voted 59-34 to move forward with Yellen’s nomination, indicating she had enough support to win confirmation. \n",
      "Bernanke’s second four-year term expires on January 31. \n",

      "Ranked No. 1 in the nation and among the top 10 in many defensive categories, Arizona opens Pac-12 play Thursday at home against Washington State. The Wildcats carry a 13-0 mark into the contest, winning by an average of nearly 20 points during the non-conference slate marked by big wins over Michigan and Duke. Arizona, a perennial offensive power, has also embraced its efforts on the defensive end of the court, ranking sixth nationally by allowing 56.7 points. \n",
      "The start of conference play couldn’t come at a worse time for Washington State, which won’t have the services of leading scorer DaVonte Lacy after he underwent an emergency procedure on his appendix Saturday.”He’s out for a while,” coach Ken Bone said. That spells trouble for Washington State as Lacy was averaging 18.9 points for the Cougars, who are last in the conference in scoring. \n",
      "TV: 10 p.m., Pac-12 Network \n",
      "ABOUT WASHINGTON STATE (7-5, 0-0 Pac-12): Bone said he learned just before the Cougars’ pregame shoot-around last Saturday that Lacy was ill and found out in the afternoon that he would be hospitalized. Still, the Cougars went out and beat Mississippi Valley State 85-48 the same evening. Freshman Que Johnson continues to emerge by scoring 60 points over the past four games and can fill some of Lacy’s void. \n",
      "ABOUT ARIZONA (13-0, 0-0 Pac-12): It was the second straight year the Wildcats went undefeated in the nonconference schedule. This time, however, seems a bit different as Arizona stamped itself as one of the national championship favorites powered by guard Nick Johnson, who has blossomed into a scoring machine averaging 16 points, and super frosh Aaron Gordon, who is a nightly double-double threat. The Wildcats also expect to have seven-footer Kaleb Tarczewski back after missing the past two games with a sprained ankle. \n",

      "By Richard Cowan \n",
      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Janet Yellen came a step closer to final approval as the Federal Reserve’s next chair after the U.S. Senate set a Monday vote on President Barack Obama’s choice to succeed Ben Bernanke. \n",
      "The Senate is expected to vote at around 5:30 p.m. EST (2230 GMT) Monday on Yellen, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. \n",
      "Yellen, who would become the first woman to chair the U.S. central bank, would take the reins on Feb. 1, one day after Bernanke ends a two-term stint during which he reached deep into the Fed’s monetary toolbox to try to revive an economy hit by a massive financial crisis that sent it into the worst downturn in decades. \n",
      "Yellen has been deeply involved in the decisions to press the Fed into uncharted monetary policy waters, as the Fed’s vice chair since 2010 and before that as chief of the San Francisco Fed. \n",
      "As she steps into her new role, her biggest challenge will likely be to begin to pare back the Fed’s crisis-era stimulus. The bank took a first step in that direction last month when policymakers voted to pare its massive bond-buying stimulus program to $75 billion a month from $85 billion. \n",
      "The Senate on Dec. 20 voted 59-34 to move forward with Yellen’s nomination, indicating she had enough support to win confirmation. \n",

      "Italy's Renzi pushes for change on election law\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "ROME (Reuters) - Italian center-left leader Matteo Renzi called on Thursday for swift reform of an electoral system blamed for the country’s bouts of political deadlock and said he expected an agreement could be completed within weeks. \n",
      "Renzi is not in the government but as head of the Democratic Party, the biggest party in Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s left-right coalition, he will have a decisive role to play in shaping the agenda and has already called for quicker action on reforms. \n",
      "Earlier on Thursday, Renzi suggested that moves to fix the economy and political system might lead to an easing of European Union deficit limits that have forced austerity measures on a resentful Italian public already coping with a long recession. \n",
      "Electoral reform has been one of the thorniest issues facing the coalition, formed after an inconclusive election last year prevented any side from forming a government on its own. \n",
      "It has been seen as a vital requirement if Italy is to elect a government capable of taking clear choices and pushing through reforms but agreement has long been held up by party bickering. \n",
      "The current system, which has been overturned in part by the Constitutional Court, makes it difficult for any party to form a stable majority in the two houses of parliament. It also gives voters no say over their individual representatives, who are appointed to fixed electoral lists by party bosses. \n",
      "Renzi proposed three different models which he said could be the basis of discussion, adding that all three proposals would give voters a clear choice and do away with the need for parties to cobble together ad-hoc coalitions to form a government. \n",
      "“It has to be clear who has won on the day of the election. Whoever wins has to be in government for five years without any fudges or grand coalitions, and it has to possible to change governments,” he said at an event in Florence. \n",
      "“The cards are on the table. We can wrap it up in two weeks or a month if the will is there.” \n",
      "One model would divide the country into 118 constituencies each electing four to five deputies, with the largest party taking a premium of 15 percent. \n",
      "A second would be based on a reworked version of the previous electoral law, with three quarters of deputies elected directly and the remainder divided between the largest party, which would take a 15 percent winner’s bonus, and a 10 percent slice reserved for some smaller parties. \n",
      "Finally, a third version would include a French-style two round system with a run-off vote, along the lines of the model already used in mayoral elections in large Italian towns. \n",
      "Under Renzi’s proposals, the Senate would lose its status as a chamber with equal powers to the lower house and become an assembly for local politicians including regional presidents and the mayors of big towns and cities. \n",
      "Doubt over the status of the electoral law has dampened speculation over a possible early return to the polls and it was not clear how quickly the other parties would be willing to move or whether a change made new elections more or less likely. \n",
      "Angelino Alfano, head of the small center-right group in Letta’s coalition, welcomed the proposals and said he favored the two round system used in mayoral elections. \n",
      "“The structure is clear and it works. There’s not much need for more talking,” he said in comments which suggested that the coalition partners at least should be able to reach an accord. \n",
      "Silvio Berlusconi, head of the center-right Forza Italia party which pulled out of Letta’s government last year and who has been pushing for an early election, welcomed the proposals “among which there is certainly a reasonable solution”. \n",
      "All parties have pressed for a reform of the electoral law for years but agreement has been blocked by fears that any change could favor an opposing party. However pressure for change has grown and Letta has promised a new law in time for the European parliamentary elections in May. \n",
      "Separately, Renzi said Italy could negotiate a relaxation of European Union deficit limits if it shows it is serious about effective reforms to its economy and political system. \n",
      "“If there’s a leadership with a vision, I can’t see a problem with passing the deficit ceiling, although we’d have to have a battle to change the rules,” he told the daily Fatto Quotidiano in an interview published on Thursday. \n",

      "By Jane Chung \n",
      "SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - South Korea’s nuclear regulator on Thursday approved the restart of three reactors halted in May to replace cables supplied using forged certificates. \n",
      "Asia’s fourth-largest economy has sought to secure stable power supply ahead of winter demand which peaks this month to make up for power lost due to a nuclear safety scandal. \n",
      "The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission said in a statement that substandard cables had been replaced and that it had approved the restart of three reactors. \n",

      "Shin Kori No.1 and Shin Wolsong No. 1 will operate at full capacity from Jan. 7, while Shin Kori No. 2 is likely to operate fully from Jan. 12, the regulator said. \n",
      "South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors, which generate about a third of its electricity. The restart of the three reactors would leave three nuclear reactors still offline. \n",
      "In May last year, a scandal over nuclear safety emerged after some parts were found to have been supplied using fake documents. \n",
      "Some 100 people were indicted and the country’s dependence on nuclear power has come under increased scrutiny. \n",

      "In the latest crash involving fuel produced in an oil patch known as the Bakken, several tank cars exploded after a collision on a desolate stretch of North Dakota track on Monday. \n",
      "In that case, as with several other accidents in recent months, tank cars exploded with a force that surprised investigators. \n",
      "The incidents “indicate that the type of crude being transported from the Bakken region may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil,” the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said on Thursday. \n",
      "New drilling methods like hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have unlocked vast oil deposits and producers eager to maximize profits often try to supply refiners off the national pipeline grid who are willing to pay more for the fuel. \n",
      "That market pull is one reason over two-thirds of North Dakota’s oil production is currently shipped by rail. \n",
      "Northern Oil & Gas Inc, Oasis Petroleum Inc and Continental Resources are among the Bakken producers whose shares dipped on Thursday. \n",
      "Regulators are working to tighten train transport safety and if those rules are costly to enforce, analysts say, it could cut into crude-by-rail profits. \n",
      "“Depending on what it costs to fix this problem, you could be eating into the dynamics that have put so much crude oil on the tracks in the first place,” said David Vernon, a transportation analyst with research firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. \n",
      "Crude-by-rail safety has been closely scrutinized since July when a runaway oil train carrying light crude from the Bakken derailed and exploded in the center of the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic, killing 47 people. \n",
      "The devastation caused by that accident and fireballs that have followed other derailments prompted regulators to scrutinize the contents of tank cars. \n",
      "PHMSA officials have examined whether Bakken crude is unduly corrosive, more sulfurous or loaded with explosive gas as it moves on the tracks from oil fields to distant refineries. \n",
      "On Thursday, Bakken producers were warned to “sufficiently degasify” crude oil being loaded onto tank cars, and officials said they will examine the “dissolved gas content” of crude oil shipments. \n",
      "Packing gas onto tank cars meant to carry liquid fuels can push the pressure to dangerous levels and provoke explosions, industry officials have said. \n",
      "“Large amounts of vapor pressure can split the tank, sink the roof and emit (a) flammable gas cloud,” the Canadian Crude Quality Technical Association, an industry-sponsored research group, concluded in March. \n",
      "Bakken producers have recently reported a large amount of corrosion in tank cars and “high vapor pressure causing bubbling crude,” the trade group said. \n",
      "Tesoro Logistics LP reported in March that pressure on Bakken crude shipments was likely to exceed federal safety standards. \n",
      "U.S. railroads want tank car manufactures to upgrade the national fleet with new safety standards that could cost the industry more than $3 billion, according to a Reuters estimate. \n",
      "If regulators opt for such standards and give the tank car industry a short time to comply, the hit to the Bakken energy sector could be severe at a time when crude-by-rail traffic is climbing. \n",
      "Trains carried nearly 700,000 barrels a day of North Dakota oil to market in October, a 67 percent jump from a year earlier, according to the state pipeline authority. \n",
      "Most of those deliveries are in 100-car ‘unit trains’ that can move huge crude volumes in unbroken shipments but that can intensify dangerous spills and derailments. \n",
      "If regulators deem unit trains dangerous - as some in the rail industry have conceded - then oil producers might also lose an efficiency that has made rail shipments an attractive alternative to pipelines. \n",

      "Senators win third straight game \n",
      "OTTAWA — Good things happened in threes for the Senators Thursday night at Canadian Tire Centre. \n",
      "They equaled a season high with their third straight victory, snapping the Winnipeg Jets’ run of wins at three in the process. \n",
      "The Senators’ 4-3 victory in front of 18,691 fans included some fortuitous bounces, as Winnipeg hit three posts, one in each period. \n",
      "“You make your own luck,” said Senators coach Paul MacLean. “If you work hard enough and you play hard enough, things can go your way. Obviously we’re playing harder, and that’s what makes puck luck.” \n",
      "Scoring for the Senators were centers Mika Zibanejad and Zack Smith, as well as wingers Milan Michalek and Clarke MacArthur. \n",
      "Defenseman Dustin Byfuglien, winger Evander Kane and center Olli Jokinen scored for the Jets. \n",
      "Jokinen was not about to use bad breaks as an excuse. \n",
      "“At the end of the day we were able to score three goals,” he said. “A lot of times when we’ve been able to score three, we’ve been finding a way to win the games. It wasn’t lack of getting chances, it was more a matter of giving up too many against a skilled team like Ottawa. \n",
      "“They make you pay.” \n",
      "Senators goalie Craig Anderson made 32 saves to pick up his fourth win in a row. Jets goalie Al Montoya made 25 saves as his winning streak was stopped at three games. \n",
      "“I thought it was a weird game, but we were in it all the way,” said Montoya. “A couple of tough bounces here and there ... we just weren’t able to pull this one off and it was there for the taking.” \n",
      "After Zibanejad and Byfuglien traded goals in the second half of the opening period on a good hop and a deflected shot, respectively, Michalek put Ottawa in front by cashing in a rebound 47 seconds from the intermission. \n",
      "Kane tied the score at 1:32 of the second when he put one in off Anderson’s back from behind the net. \n",
      "Smith gave Ottawa the lead again 6:42 into the third, deflecting a Marc Methot wrist shot from the point. MacArthur provided some padding after a defensive zone breakdown by the Jets, taking a feed from center Kyle Turris and putting a nice move on Montoya for his 13th of the season. \n",
      "“That fourth one is a backbreaker,” said Montoya. “It can’t happen. We’ve got to be better.” \n",
      "Jokinen kept the Jets alive with 5:29 left in regulation, but they were unable to tie the game one more time. \n",
      "The win improved the Senators record to 18-18-7 while moving them to within three points of the Detroit Red Wings in the race for the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. \n",
      "The Jets, who are six back of a playoff spot in the West, fell to 19-19-5. \n",
      "“It was nice to get rewarded at the end,” said MacArthur. “That’s just an important two points for us there. \n",
      "“We’ve got something rolling here now with three in a row. They aren’t all going to be pretty, but at this time of year, and where the standings are, we’ll take anything we can get.” \n",
      "The Senators play their next four games on the road, starting Saturday in Montreal, while the Jets visit Boston on Saturday. \n",
      "NOTES: Senators C Jason Spezza practiced with the team Thursday morning and may return to the lineup Saturday in Montreal. The Ottawa captain has missed the last three games with a hip flexor injury. ... Jets D Dustin Byfuglien, who led all NHL defenseman in shots with 140 heading into the game, scored his eighth goal of the season in the first period. ... Jets W Evander Kane’s second-period goal was his fifth in nine games since returning from injury. ... Senators D Patrick Wiercioch, who was coming off what coach Paul MacLean called two good games in a row, was a healthy scratch for the fifth time in the last seven. Joining him was D Eric Gryba, who has now been a healthy scratch 23 times this season. ... The Jets’ scratches were D Adam Pardy and W Eric O’Dell, an Ottawa native.\n",

      "\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Penn State on Thursday announced the resignation of its head football coach Bill O’Brien, who was hired two years ago in the wake of a child sex abuse scandal that cost legendary coach Joe Paterno his job. \n",
      "O’Brien, a former assistant coach for the New England Patriots, will return to the NFL as head coach of the Houston Texans, university athletic director Dave Joyner said at a campus press conference in State College, Pennsylvania. \n",
      "“Bill O’Brien has informed Penn State that he is resigning from his position as head coach of the football program to become head coach in the National Football League for the Houston Texans,” Joyner said. \n",
      "“A national search will begin immediately to select Penn State’s 16th head football coach,” he said. “I just want to emphasize that we are happy for Coach O’Brien.” \n",
      "O’Brien was not at the press conference, and the Houston Texans have not made any announcement on a new coach. \n",
      "O’Brien was hired in January of 2012 in the wake of a criminal case against former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was ultimately convicted on 45 charges of child sex abuse. \n",
      "As a result of the scandal, Paterno, the winningest coach in college football history, and Sandusky’s boss, was fired in 2011. Paterno died of lung cancer in January of 2012, when O’Brien was hired. \n",
      "O’Brien compiled a 15-9 record in his two seasons coaching Penn State’s Nittany Lions, a feat made more difficult by sanctions the NCAA placed on the football program as a result of the Sandusky scandal. Sanctions included limiting the number of scholarships the school could offer football players, a $60 million fine, forfeiting wins from 1998 to 2011, and a ban on post-season bowl appearances. \n",
      "In the NFL, the Texans finished the year with a 2-14 record. \n",

      "By Julia Fioretti and Harpreet Bhal \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Copper rose to a seven-month high on Thursday, lifted by shrinking supplies and prospects for global economic recovery, though signs of weakness in top consumer China capped gains. \n",
      "Three-month LME copper reached its highest since June 5 at $7,460 a tonne and closed at $7,393 from the previous close of $7,360. \n",
      "The metal used in power and construction fell 7.2 percent in 2013 but gained more than 4 percent in December, posting its biggest monthly rise since September 2012. \n",
      "Copper’s yearly decline was more modest than many expected as an expected surge in new mine production was stymied by processing backlogs. These have limited the amount of refined metal being produced and prices have failed to fall significantly. \n",
      "Copper’s rise on Thursday was restrained by a survey showing China’s factory activity expanded at the slowest pace in three months in December, weighed down by shrinking export orders. \n",
      "“China’s PMI numbers showed momentum is waning. I expect that a sell-off is on the cards,” said Gianclaudio Torlizzi, partner at T-Commodity. \n",
      "“Potentially copper might reach $7,600 before turning down.” \n",
      "China accounts for as much as 40 percent of global demand for refined copper. \n",
      "“With the focus on copper in recent months having been mostly centred around the prospect for increased availability of supply, the continued pick up in demand as evidenced through the drop in inventory levels has forced traders to switch their focus,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. \n",
      "Copper stocks in LME-monitored warehouses dropped a further 725 tonnes to 366,485 tonnes on Thursday, the lowest level since January 2013, exchange data showed. \n",
      "In a sign of resilience in the United States, the world’s largest economy, a gauge of factory activity held near a 2-1/2-year high in December and the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell for a second week last week. \n",
      "In other metals, zinc closed at $2,075 a tonne from its previous close of $2,055.5 a tonne. Analysts believe that mine closures will squeeze the oversupplied market and drive prices higher. \n",
      "It hit a 10-month peak of $2,108 on Dec. 27 and was the top performer among industrial metals in 2013, losing only 1.2 percent compared with aluminium’s 13.2 percent tumble. \n",

      "* Labour accuses firms of overcharging by almost 4bn pounds \n",
      "* Ofgem regulator says market too opaque to test allegation \n",
      "* Firms reject charge, say data used not comparable \n",
      "* Energy prices hot political issue before next year’s vote \n",
      "By Andrew Osborn \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour party accused the country’s big six energy suppliers of overcharging consumers by almost 4 billion pounds as it sought to keep living standards at the heart of the political debate before a parliamentary election next year. \n",
      "Labour, which is ahead of Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservative party in opinion polls by around 6 points, dominated the agenda towards the end of last year with a popular promise to freeze energy prices for 20 months if elected. \n",
      "Though the economy is staging a strong recovery after years of stagnating, inflation, while falling, has outstripped wages meaning many voters have yet to feel the upturn’s benefits, an anomaly that Labour has used to criticise Cameron’s party. \n",
      "The big six energy firms - British Gas-owner Centrica , SSE, RWE’s npower, Iberdrola’s Scottish Power, E.ON and EDF Energy  - supply 98 percent of homes. They angered the public by unveiling above inflation price rises at the end of last year. \n",
      "On Thursday, Labour said its analysis of comparative energy market price data suggested that the six companies had overcharged consumers to the tune of over 3.8 billion pounds in the past three years by artificially inflating the cost of wholesale power that they purchased from power stations. \n",
      "That amounted to households being overcharged by, on average, nearly 48 pounds each year, Labour said. \n",
      "“These figures reveal the full extent of the way consumers have been overcharged for their electricity,” Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokeswoman, said in a statement. \n",
      "“Energy companies always blame wholesale costs when they put up bills, but it now looks like they’ve deliberately inflated prices to boost profits from their power stations.” \n",
      "Labour reached its conclusion by comparing the price paid for electricity by the energy giants with the average market price a year ahead provided to them by First Utility, Britain’s biggest independent energy supplier. \n",
      "Ofgem, the market regulator, had serious questions to answer about why it had failed to monitor the way in which companies had bought electricity from themselves and why it had allowed them to overcharge their customers, Labour said. \n",
      "However, Ian Marlee, a senior partner for Ofgem, said the regulator was unable to test Labour’s allegations due to a lack of market transparency. \n",
      "“What we identified in our work was that actually there is not enough transparency to be able to actually look at that,” he told BBC radio when asked about the allegations. \n",
      "Ofgem was trying to make the market less opaque, he added. Labour said his answer was “just not good enough”. \n",
      "Energy UK, which represents the big six, suggested Labour’s comparison was flawed because the figures it used were not directly comparable and wholesale prices included much more than just the cost of energy. \n",
      "“Energy suppliers pay the most competitive price they can for the gas and electricity they purchase,” it said. \n",
      "“The overall costs of wholesale energy ... include a number of costs so are not purely market prices. Also, as suppliers buy their energy ahead so its there when customers want and need it, averages in this area don’t give the true picture.” \n",
      "The energy industry would be providing clearer explanations about pricing in the year ahead, it added. \n",
      "Cameron, who has dismissed Labour’s energy promises as populist and unworkable, has promised to cut rising energy costs by transferring the cost of helping poor families with energy prices from household bills to general taxation. \n",
      "He has also pledged that the cost of a scheme to subsidise the insulation of houses - also included in household energy bills - will be spread over a longer period to bring down its cost.\n",

      "* HSBC Brazil Manufacturing PMI rises to 50.5 from 49.7 \n",
      "* Consumer goods output rises, capital goods drop \n",
      "By Asher Levine \n",
      "SAO PAULO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Brazil’s manufacturing activity rose slightly in December as the volume of new orders increased for the first month in six, a private survey showed on Thursday. \n",
      "The HSBC Purchasing Managers’ Index for the Brazilian manufacturing sector rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.5 in December from 49.7 in November. The 50 mark separates contraction from expansion. \n",
      "Output expanded for the fourth straight month, the survey showed, mostly due to new contract wins. Consumer goods posted an improvement in new orders and output, though the capital goods segment declined as orders fell. \n",
      "Brazil’s manufacturers have limited a sustained turnaround in the nation’s sluggish economy as factories deal with high labor costs, poor infrastructure and a hefty tax burden. \n",
      "While firms surveyed reported strengthening demand, they noted that economic uncertainty has weighed on client confidence. \n",
      "“Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded on the back of stronger production growth,” said Andre Loes, chief Brazil economist at HSBC. “Companies also reported less pressure on both input costs and prices charged.” \n",
      "Input prices continued to expand, but at their slowest pace since May, while output prices expanded at the slowest rate since July 2012. Still, manufacturers reported that a weaker currency continued to add to the cost of raw materials. \n",
      "Brazil’s currency, the real, has weakened about 12 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, but export orders have remained nearly stagnant. Often a weaker currency helps boost exports by making locally made products less expensive on the global market, though survey respondents pointed to lower demand from abroad as well as increased competition. \n",
      "Stocks of finished goods decreased for the ninth straight month, though only marginally, as firms attempted to meet orders from inventory in order to free up working capital. \n",
      "Brazilian factories also cut jobs for a ninth straight month as intermediate and capital goods producers reduced payrolls, according to the report.\n",

      "Italy posts December state sector surplus but full year deficit\n",
      "\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "ROME, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Italy posted a state sector budget surplus of 15 billion euros in December 2013, up from a surplus of 13.4 billion euros in the same month a year earlier, the finance ministry said on Thursday. \n",
      "But the total for 2013 was a deficit of 79.7 billion euros, a worsening from 2012’s 49.5 billion euro deficit, due to what the finance ministry called “extraordinary operations” including paying off public debt to companies and aiding troubled lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena. \n",
      "The December surplus was due to an increase in tax revenues and sales of state-owned real estate as well as cuts to government expenditure, the statement said. \n",
      "The state sector borrowing requirement (SSBR), a measure of the gap between central government spending and income, differs from the broader “general government” accounts, which the European Union Stability and Growth Pact refers to when assessing countries’ deficit performances. \n",

      "UPDATE 2-Arsonist strikes Chinese consulate in San Francisco\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "(New throughout, adds details and updates with comments from consular spokesman Wang Chuan) \n",
      "By Sarah McBride and Adam Rose \n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Chinese consulate in San Francisco sustained fire and smoke damage after an arsonist struck it, the consulate said on Thursday, but there were no injuries and the consulate was open for business. \n",
      "The consulate said video cameras recorded the arsonist on Wednesday night, carrying two cans of gasoline from a van parked on the street and then setting an embassy gate ablaze. The San Francisco Fire Department said it responded two minutes after the fire was reported and quickly put out the fire. The U.S. FBI, which is investigating the arson, said no suspects have been arrested. \n",
      "“We strongly condemn this despicable attack,” said Wang Chuan, the consulate spokesman, reading from a statement at a brief news conference. “We urge the U.S. side to take all necessary measures to provide adequate protection for Chinese consular personnel and properties.” \n",
      "Chuan gave the news conference standing in front of the Laguna Street entrance to the consulate, where a door flanked by statues of lions was charred and the area above it blackened by smoke. Broken glass from a window above the gateway of the door lay on the steps, along with some debris. The interior door just inside the gate was boarded with plywood. \n",
      "The entrance hit by the arsonist is around the corner from where most of the public enters the building on Geary Street. \n",
      "The consulate said it was working with U.S. authorities, including the San Francisco Police Department, the Fire Department and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the U.S. State Department, and urged them to solve the crime quickly. \n",
      "The San Francisco Fire Department said it received a report of a fire at 9:33 p.m. PST (0500 GMT), arrived on the scene within two minutes and brought the fire under control within six minutes, and has turned over the investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \n",
      "FBI spokesman Peter Lee said the FBI’s evidence response team responded to the scene on Wednesday night “to see if there is any actionable evidence to hopefully bring the perpetrator or perpetrators to justice.” \n",
      "A small group of staff members was in the consulate when it was attacked, Chuan said. He said video cameras recorded the suspect throwing at least one bottle through the glass over the gate. He declined to provide details on the suspect’s gender, age or ethnicity, or to speculate about possible motives. \n",
      "The consulate will remain open for business, he added. Dozens of visa applicants entered the consulate after lining up early at the Geary Street entrance, some unaware of the fire that had burned around the corner. \n",
      "State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the United States is “deeply concerned” by the reported arson attack. “We take this incident very seriously,” she said at a briefing in Washington. She did not comment on whether security was being stepped up at the consulate or at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, and said she was not aware of any specific threats against the consulate. \n",
      "Protests are common outside Chinese diplomatic missions in Western countries, but acts of violence are rare. \n",
      "The safety of diplomatic personnel and missions is a sensitive issue in China after a 1999 incident in which the U.S. military accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during air strikes against Serbia. \n",
      "That bombing, which many Chinese still believe was intentional, sparked violent anti-NATO demonstrations across China and brought relations with the United States close to a breaking point.

      "By Ryan Vlastelica \n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on their first day of trading in 2014 as investors booked profits in the wake of the S&P; 500’s best yearly advance since 1997. \n",
      "Some of 2013’s strongest performers fell on the day, though traders also scooped up bargains in some of last year’s weakest names. \n",
      "All 10 S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with tech among the biggest drags after Wells Fargo downgraded Apple Inc to “market perform” from “outperform,” saying the company’s market cap had limited upside potential without material market share gains. \n",
      "Apple fell 1.4 percent to $553.02 and was the biggest drag on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes. The S&P; technology index fell 1 percent. \n",
      "Adding to the weakness in the group were those that had enjoyed the best gains in 2013, including Netflix, which was down 1.5 percent at $362.57, and Micron Tech Inc , which was off 1 percent at $21.52. Both names more than tripled last year. Conversely, Newmont Mining was the biggest gainer of the day, up 5.3 percent to $24.25; the stock was the weakest S&P; component of 2013. \n",
      "“There’s no fundamental underpinning to the decline today, just basic portfolio rebalancing on the first day of a new tax year,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Global Investments. “People are taking profits and seeking bargains.” \n",
      "The Dow Jones industrial average was down 116.07 points, or 0.70 percent, at 16,460.59. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 15.55 points, or 0.84 percent, at 1,832.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 34.80 points, or 0.83 percent, at 4,141.79. \n",
      "The S&P; 500 closed 2013 with a spectacular 29.6 percent gain for the year, its best annual performance since 1997, adding $3.75 trillion in market value. The Dow  surged 26.5 percent in its best year since 1995. The Nasdaq  jumped 38.3 percent, its best year since 2009. \n",
      "An index of U.S. factory activity stood at 57.0 last month, in line with economists’ forecast but a touch below November’s 2-1/2-year high of 57.3. \n",
      "Other data included weekly initial claims which slipped for a second week, to 339,000, suggesting labor market conditions continued to steadily improve. In another sign of economic improvement, financial data firm Markit said its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 55.0 in December, beating November’s 54.7 reading. \n",
      "“The data indicates that the economy has momentum in 2014, but the odds are low that we’ll see gains of the magnitude we saw last year,” said McDonald, who helps oversee more than $800 billion. “Valuations were the big driver last year, but now that those are richer we need earnings to pick up the mantle.” \n",
      "In a note to clients, Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup, boosted his year-end 2014 target for the S&P; 500 to 1,975 from 1,900, citing earnings progress as the primary driver. \n",
      "On the upside, U.S. Steel Corp rose 2.8 percent to $30.32 after KeyBanc upgraded the stock to “buy,” while Urban Outfitters rose 2 percent to $37.85 on an upgrade from Jefferies. \n",
      "Trading volume remained light on Thursday with many market participants away during the holiday-abbreviated week. Markets were closed Wednesday for New Year’s Day.\n",

      "As Obamacare begins, critics launch a new assault in ads\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative activists opposed to President Barack Obama’s healthcare overhaul started a new assault on the Affordable Care Act as more than 2 million people began new health coverage under the law on Thursday. \n",
      "One group, which is backed by the libertarian billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, launched a $2.5 million television ad campaign that targets three Democratic senators who support the law and could face stiff challenges from Republicans in November elections. \n",
      "The group, Americans for Prosperity, or AFP, spent more than $36 million on the 2012 elections, largely for ads that bashed the law known as Obamacare and Democrats who supported it. \n",
      "The ads by AFP are aimed at North Carolina’s Kay Hagan, Louisiana’s Mary Landrieu and New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen. Their bids for re-election will be crucial to Democrats’ efforts to keep control of the U.S. Senate, where Democrats control 55 of the 100 seats. \n",
      "The 30-second videos represent something of a turn in strategy for conservatives, who have spent much of the past year focused on calling for the repeal of the healthcare law, the most sweeping social program since the 1960s. \n",
      "Now, with more than 2 million people having signed up for Obamacare and more enrolling for coverage every day, AFP and other critics are signaling that in advance of the elections, they will try to cast Democrats as liars who misled Americans about the law. \n",
      "The new ads try to link the senators to Obama and his discredited pledge that all Americans who liked their healthcare plans before Obamacare went into effect could keep those plans. \n",
      "In fact, the minimum coverage standards imposed by the healthcare law meant that hundreds of thousands of people with inexpensive, bare-bones policies had their policies canceled. They will have to buy coverage that in some cases is more expensive. Federal subsidies will help many low-income Americans make that transition. \n",
      "For years, Obama had said that “if you like your current insurance, you keep your current insurance.” But in early November he acknowledged that some would not be able to keep their policies and apologized for understating the law’s impact on those people. \n",
      "His initial statements were dubbed the “Lie of the Year” by the PolitiFact fact-checking website. \n",
      "The ads are the latest anti-Obamacare push by the AFP, which since August has spent nearly $19 million on TV messages targeting Democrats who support the law. It was passed in 2010 to help millions of uninsured and under-insured Americans, but Republicans have opposed the reform as an unwarranted expansion of the federal government and say it is too costly and eliminates healthcare choices for many. \n",
      "In the AFP ad aimed at Hagan, a North Carolina woman whose insurance plan was canceled talks directly to the camera. \n",
      "“Kay Hagan told us, ‘If you like your insurance plan and your doctor, you can keep them.’ That just wasn’t true,” she says. The Shaheen and Landrieu ads feature the senators repeating Obama’s claim. \n",
      "In a statement, Landrieu’s campaign called the AFP ads a “grossly misleading” distortion of her efforts to improve the healthcare law. \n",
      "Hagan’s office said it was “a new year and a new smear from a Koch brothers-backed group that has no accountability to North Carolinians.” \n",
      "AFP president Tim Phillips said the ads would run for up to three weeks. “We believe that repealing Obamacare is going to be a long-term effort, and this is part of that long-term effort,” he said. \n",

      "UPDATE 1-Wall St watchdog puts spotlight on firms hiring risky brokers\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "By Suzanne Barlyn \n",
      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street brokerages that hire stockbrokers who have a track record of misconduct should expect to show examiners how they will curb future wrongdoing, the industry’s watchdog said on Thursday in an overview of issues it will review in 2014. \n",
      "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said it will review the process that firms use to research problem brokers before hiring them. The industry-funded watchdog also wants to know whether firms take extra measures to supervise the brokers to prevent future misdeeds, such as sales abuses involving client accounts. \n",
      "“You have to know your customer and the product you’re selling. But firms also really have to know who they’re hiring,” Susan Axelrod, FINRA’s head of regulatory operations, told Reuters. \n",
      "FINRA, which routinely examines the industry’s nearly 4,200 securities firms to gauge their compliance with securities industry rules, published its annual list of “examination priorities” on Thursday. The regulator’s beefed-up interest in problem brokers follows its efforts last year to rein in brokers with troublesome professional histories, including numerous customer complaints or sanctions such as fines and suspensions. \n",
      "FINRA said it will also launch a specialized enforcement team in 2014, composed of four to six lawyers, to prosecute brokers who pose a high risk to the investing public. Sanctions could include fines, suspensions, or being barred from the industry. \n",
      "FINRA said only a “small number” of the industry’s 636,200 brokers engage in a pattern of misbehavior that could harm investors. \n",
      "FINRA has barred 22 high-risk brokers from the securities industry since February 2013, around the time it started to fast-track investigations and disciplinary cases involving risky brokers, Axelrod said. \n",
      "Nonetheless, some brokers with checkered pasts remain in the industry. Axelrod said that sometimes occurs when brokers were disciplined for selling troubled products in which investors lost money, such as auction-rate securities, but blame is placed on the firm rather than the individual broker and the brokers are not forced out of the industry. The details do appear on the brokers’ public records. \n",
      "In other cases, investors do not want to speak to FINRA about their dealings with a broker, which makes it difficult to prove a case, Axelrod said. \n",
      "“You’d love to have a world in which all persons who are at risk of making mistakes would be knocked out of the industry, but you have to do it in a way that’s fair and has some balance, Richard Ketchum, FINRA’s chairman and chief executive said. \n",
      "The regulator said it is also honing in on potential risks posed by brokers who worked at firms that were expelled from the securities industry. Many of the brokers are not barred because of their firms’ wrongdoing and find work at other firms. They may, however, bring “unethical or illegal practices” with them, FINRA said, adding that it is identifying and monitoring these firms and individuals. \n",
      "Firms that hire high-risk brokers strictly to boost their bottom line should expect to explain to examiners what hiring practices and procedures they are taking to bolster supervision, Axelrod said. Brokers should also expect to field questions. \n",
      "Sanctions stemming from poor policies or the hiring of too many high-risk brokers will depend on the severity of what FINRA is able to prove, Axelrod said. They could range from fines to shutting down a firm. \n",
      "Other issues FINRA will review include sales of securities that are sensitive to interest rates, cyber security and firms’ practices for rolling over investors’ retirement plan savings into individual retirement accounts.\n",

      "Roberto Nelson, the Pac-12’s leading scorer at 20 points per game, had 23 for Oregon State (8-5), which entered the game seventh in the nation in field goal percentage at 50.8 but shot 37.5 percent. Devon Collier registered eight points and eight rebounds. \n",

      "Curry leads Warriors to win in Miami \n",
      "MIAMI — Golden State Warriors coach Mark Jackson said after Thursday’s 123-114 win over the Miami Heat that if guard Stephen Curry doesn’t make the NBA All-Star team this year, he “might retire.” \n",
      "After Curry buried the Heat with 36 points, few if any Miami players or coaches would doubt that the Warriors star is worthy of such status. \n",
      "Curry also had a game-high 12 assists to help the Warriors to their seventh consecutive win. \n",
      "“He’s an unbelievable shooter,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Curry. “You have to get to him very quickly because of his range and the different ways he can get into the three — off the dribble, off the catch, running him off screens ... He put on a clinic.” \n",
      "Indeed, the Warriors and Curry dented the Heat’s defense for the highest totals by an opposing team and player this season. \n",
      "Curry, who set an NBA record with 272 3-pointers last season, made eight of 15 attempts from long distance Thursday. Overall, he made 13 of 22 shots from the floor and two of three from the foul line. \n",
      "Asked if he is ever surprised when any team gives him space to shoot, Curry credited his teammates. \n",
      "“We have so many weapons,” he said. “Earlier in the game, (the Heat were) being aggressive on pick-and-rolls. (Warriors forward David Lee) was able to catch the ball in the post and at the elbow and make some plays. \n",
      "“They had to make an adjustment, and I was able to find some daylight.” \n",
      "Lee added 32 points and a game-high 14 rebounds, making 13 of 17 shots from the floor. \n",
      "“Hash-tag full squad,” Lee said of the team effort. “Everybody participated. Since we won the games we were supposed to win on the first part of this road trip, we came in here willing to roll the dice and be aggressive from the jump. \n",
      "“I’m happy we were able to sustain it for the entire game because (the Heat) are a championship-level team that will make plays down the stretch. They’re not going to give up until the final buzzer. We kept our turnovers (18) down to a reasonable level.” \n",
      "The Warriors also shot 56.1 percent from the floor and led after every quarter. Golden State’s largest lead was 15 points. \n",
      "Warriors guard Klay Thompson added 16 points, and forward Harrison Barnes came off the bench to score 15 points. \n",
      "The Heat (24-8) won eight of their previous nine games, but they could not stop the Warriors’ offense. \n",
      "Miami forward LeBron James finished with a team-high 26 points and a season-high eight turnovers. \n",
      "“You don’t take credit for defense against LeBron,” Jackson said. “(Against) the same defense, he can get 50. We just wanted to battle, compete — defend him collectively. We wanted to keep him away from the paint and the rim — there’s no secret. \n",
      "“He is the best small forward who has ever played the game in my opinion, and he is still in his prime, which is absolutely scary.” \n",
      "Four other Heat players scored in double figures: guard Dwyane Wade with 22 points, forward Chris Bosh with 19 points, guard Mario Chalmers with 17 points and forward Shane Battier with 11 points. \n",
      "Golden State (21-13) shot a blistering 79 percent in the first quarter to take a 38-33 lead. The Warriors made 15 of 19 shots, including five of six 3-pointers. \n",
      "It was the most points the Heat allowed in any quarter all season. \n",
      "The Warriors cooled off in the second quarter, shooting 47 percent, but they still led 65-61 at halftime. \n",
      "The Warriors outscored the Heat 31-26 in the third quarter to take a 96-87 lead. Curry, who had nine points in the first quarter and five in the second, heated up in the third with 14 points. \n",
      "By that point, the Heat was in serious trouble. \n",
      "“They played a heck of a game and deserved to win,” Spoelstra said of the Warriors. “Not just the three-point shooting — when they needed to make plays at pivotal times, they made them, and we did not.” \n",
      "NOTES: Warriors coach Mark Jackson and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra were each issued technical fouls in the second half. ... The Heat allowed 94 points per game in November, but that number rose to 100 in December. ... Heat G Dwyane Wade (back spasms) and G Norris Cole (face injury) were cleared to play. ... Heat F Chris “Birdman” Andersen, who missed the past three games because of back spasms, also was cleared. ... While preparing to take 3-point shots in the corner, Warriors SG Klay Thompson stepped out of bounds — twice — in the first quarter. ... Up next, the Warriors play the fourth of a seven-game road trip at Atlanta. ... The Heat take a short trip to play the Orlando Magic on Saturday.\n",

      "Starting goaltender Corey Crawford makes his return to the lineup when the Chicago Blackhawks visit the New York Islanders on Friday in the opener of a brief two-game road trip. Crawford, who helped the Blackhawks win their second Stanley Cup in four seasons in 2013, missed the last 10 games with a lower-body injury, but Chicago went 7-1-2 in his absence. “I’m excited to start playing again,” Crawford said. “It’s been a little bit too long. It will be nice to get back into a game.” \n",
      "The Islanders are buried in the basement of the Metropolitan Division but are coming off a pair of dramatic come-from-behind victories at Minnesota and Boston, erasing a three-goal deficit against the Wild and rallying from 3-1 down versus the Bruins. New York has won four straight on the road, but it needs to find a way to translate that success to its home rink. The Islanders have dropped eight straight (0-4-4) at Nassau Coliseum and gone a franchise-record 10 games (1-5-4) without a regulation home win. \n",
      "TV: 7 p.m. ET, CSN (Chicago), MSG Plus (New York) \n",
      "ABOUT THE BLACKHAWKS (28-7-7): Patrick Kane, who is second to Pittsburgh’s Sidney Crosby in the league scoring race, was a shoo-in to make the United States Olympic Team while teammate Brandon Saad was skipped over. Saad has scored in two straight games, and his 16 goals and 30 points have already surpassed his totals (10, 27) from last season’s rookie campaign. “He’s a threat. He’s dangerous every time he touches the puck and has a nice pace to his game,” coach Joel Quenneville said of Saad. “I’ve seen a lot of signs of improvement.” \n",
      "ABOUT THE ISLANDERS (13-21-7): One of the more noteworthy snubs for the American Olympic squad was Kyle Okposo, who is second on the team to captain John Tavares with 15 goals and 25 assists in 40 games. Okposo also is on a tear with five goals and six assists during a seven-game point streak and is coming off the first back-to-back three-point performances of his career. Tavares registered a pair of goals and two assists in the victory over Boston for the seventh four-point effort of his career. \n",
      "1. Chicago has points in seven straight games (5-0-2). \n",
      "2. Islanders LW Thomas Vanek has recorded three goals and six assists during a six-game point streak. \n",
      "3. Crawford has allowed four goals in winning both career starts against New York. \n",

      "Having U.S. Medicaid insurance may increase ER use -study\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "CHICAGO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Expanding access to Medicaid, a major plank of President Barack Obama’s health reform law, could increase emergency room visits by people on the healthcare program for the poor rather than decrease them, results of a study published on Thursday suggest. \n",
      "A unique experiment in Oregon in which residents were randomly given Medicaid insurance cards, showed their visits to the emergency room increased by 40 percent, a sobering statistic as many states face an influx of new Medicaid patients under the  new law. \n",
      "The study, published in the journal Science, suggests simply providing insurance coverage to low-income Americans will not be enough to curb their use of emergency rooms, which for many has been the only place they can turn when health problems become acute and more costly to treat. \n",
      "The research, based on records from thousands of emergency room visits, did not shed light on why ER visits increased. \n",
      "Opponents of the Affordable Care Act seized on the study as evidence that the law will lead to higher costs for the healthcare system rather than save money over time. \n",
      "The law, popularly known as Obamacare, allows states to expand Medicaid to millions more of their residents. Coverage under the new criteria, which have been adopted in some form by 26 states, took effect on Jan. 1. \n",
      "The Obama administration estimated in September that Medicaid enrollment will increase by 8.7 million in 2014, nearly all as a result of the Obamacare expansion. \n",
      "The findings seem to counter Obama’s assurances that his medical coverage overhaul will ease pressure on emergency rooms and suggest ER spending could increase by half a billion dollars per year, said Michael Cannon, a healthcare expert at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington. \n",
      "Cannon based that estimate on the study authors’ estimate that Medicaid increases annual spending in the emergency department by about $120 per covered individual. \n",
      "Dr David Ansell, chief medical officer of Rush University Medical Center, which serves low-income patients from Chicago’s West and South sides, said he was not surprised by the findings, noting that the uninsured have been “trained” to turn to the emergency department for care. \n",
      "“We will change behavior when we change people’s experiences. It will take time,” he said. \n",
      "Some proponents of Medicaid expansion say the coverage will encourage people to first seek care with primary care doctors, who can help identify health problems with preventive screenings and manage chronic ailments, reducing the need for high-cost care in an emergency department. \n",
      "“What we find is that Medicaid increases emergency department use,” said study lead author Sarah Taubman of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a non-partisan research group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \n",
      "To study this issue, Taubman and colleagues turned to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a study in which the state randomly picked a group of low-income adults to receive insurance coverage under its Medicaid program. \n",
      "Taubman’s team examined emergency room records for roughly 25,000 low-income adults in the Portland area over a period of 18 months. Of those, 9,626 were selected to receive Medicaid and 15,020 served as a control group. \n",
      "They found that among people who got Medicaid, emergency department visits per person went up by 0.4 percent over 18 months compared with similar uninsured individuals. \n",
      "“It’s an increase of about 40 percent,” Taubman said. \n",
      "Taubman said the lottery gives a rare opportunity to study the policy change using a randomized trial, an especially rigorous type of study, lending added confidence in the findings. \n",
      "The findings “explode the myth that health insurance access will reduce the strain on emergency services,” a major driver of healthcare spending in the United States, Raymond Fishman of Columbia Business School wrote in an accompanying commentary published in the same journal. \n",
      "Twenty-five mostly Republican-run states have rejected the Medicaid expansion, arguing that the initially generous federal subsidies to the states will taper off and leave them with a huge healthcare bill.\n",

      "NEW YORK/LONDON/BEIJING, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Global manufacturing ended 2013 on a strong note, as major  exporters like the United States, Japan and Germany all saw demand pick up, although China’s performance remained modest, surveys showed on Thursday. \n",
      "Years of loose monetary policy, along with soaring stock markets, appear to be bolstering economic confidence. That bodes well for a global economy that has struggled to shake off the effects of financial crisis and recession. \n",
      "U.S. manufacturing activity grew in December at its swiftest pace in 11 months and the rate of job growth was the strongest since March, according to Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index. \n",
      "Other U.S. economic figures, including construction spending and the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ survey, also pointed to steady gains in the world’s largest economy. \n",
      "“We have had a whole string of strong ISM numbers. This is a gauge of sentiment and sentiment is improving,” said Scott Brown, chief economist with Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. \n",
      "“Europe has turned the corner. It’s not contracting at least. The emerging markets are doing better. We are looking for growth to pick up once again in the new year and we have few headwinds to deal with, especially less fiscal drag.” \n",
      "The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing PMI index dipped slightly to 57 from 57.3 in November, but that’s still well above the 50 level that indicates growth in the sector. Construction spending rose 2.2 percent to a four-and-a-half-year high. \n",
      "A Reuters poll of economists taken in mid-December forecasts annualized first-quarter economic growth of 2.5 percent, reaching 3 percent by year-end. Since then, economic data has tended to exceed forecasts. \n",
      "U.S. stock markets have been on a tear, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve eases off on its monthly stimulus. The S&P; 500 benchmark closed at all-time highs on Tuesday, even though equities dipped modestly on Thursday. \n",
      "Factory sentiment hit a 10-month high in Mexico, with the HSBC Mexico Manufacturing PMI rising to 52.6 in December, thanks to improved new orders and output. \n",
      "Euro zone manufacturing grew at the fastest rate since mid- 2011 in December on brisk business in Germany and Italy, Markit Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs) showed. Add in the fastest growth in 7 1/2 years for Japanese manufacturing and no major slowdown in Chinese manufacturing output, and the stage is set for a solid start to the year. \n",
      "“Looking ahead, the hope for the euro zone is that recent improved confidence will encourage businesses to lift their employment and investment plans as 2014 progresses, and will also encourage consumers to spend more,” said Howard Archer, the chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight. \n",
      "Markit’s U.S. manufacturing index rose to 55 in December from a final reading of 54.7 in November, above the 50 threshold that indicates growth. \n",
      "Markit’s Euro zone manufacturing PMI rose to 52.7 in December from 51.6 in November. \n",
      "While business is showing signs of life, unemployment in many euro zone countries, particularly among young people, remains high. However, the PMIs showed almost two years of job cuts across euro zone factories nearly ended last month. \n",
      "Manufacturing appears to reviving in several euro zone countries that have struggled since the sovereign debt crisis broke out more than four years ago, with gains in Spain, Ireland and even Greece. \n",
      "In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, manufacturing grew at its fastest pace since mid-2011, with its PMI rising to 54.3 from 52.7. The Dutch posted their fastest rate in more than two years. \n",
      "But the euro zone’s No. 2 economy, France, is still lagging. Its PMI fell sharply to 47.0 from 48.4, a seven-month low, marking faster contraction as the year drew to a close. \n",
      "Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, noted that euro zone manufacturers have begun raising prices, suggesting some strengthening in almost non-existent pricing power. \n",
      "“It seems likely that the manufacturing sector will help drive a meaningful, albeit still modest, recovery in the wider economy,” Williamson said. \n",
      "In Britain, which in the last several months has been outperforming the euro economies, the manufacturing PMI unexpectedly slipped to 57.3 from 58.1. Even so, manufacturing output probably grew by 1 percent in the fourth quarter alone, according to Markit. \n",
      "In Asia, performance was a bit more mixed. Already lacklustre output slowed in India, owing mainly to weak  domestic demand. But orders from abroad picked up. \n",
      "“The most striking feature of today’s PMIs was the rise in the output component recorded everywhere but India,” wrote Krystal Tan, Asia economist at consultancy Capital Economics. \n",
      "The HSBC/Markit PMI for China slipped to a three-month low of 50.5 in December, consistent with a dip in the official government PMI to a four-month low of 51.0. \n",
      "Capital Economics’ Tan noted that new orders growth in  Asia, while not as strong as output, was better for most economies than it was just a few months ago. \n",
      "“This fits with our view that the region’s manufacturing sectors are on a gradual road to recovery, supported by loose monetary policy and strengthening external demand.” \n",
      "The PMIs for South Korea and Indonesia, important emerging economies in Asia, both rose in December but remained at relatively low levels.\n",

      "U.S. ship to depart soon on chemical weapons mission to Mediterranean\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "PORTSMOUTH, Virginia (Reuters) - The U.S.-owned cargo ship with the capability to destroy the nastiest of Syria’s chemical weapons will depart for the Mediterranean in about two weeks, officials said on Thursday as shipyard workers readied the vessel for new sea trials. \n",
      "Forklifts moved equipment and sparks flew as workers welded containers and other gear on the deck of the MV Cape Ray, which is being outfitted with modular housing to accommodate three times its normal complement of personnel, plus two hydrolysis units for destroying Syrian chemicals used in mustard and nerve gas weapons. \n",
      "“Without this ship, this mission is not possible,” top Pentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall, who has oversight of chemical, biological and nuclear arms, told reporters who were invited to tour the vessel at dock in Portsmouth, Virginia. \n",
      "“This avoids having to put these materials on somebody’s territory, where you have to deal with all the political and environmental conditions associated with doing that under local law,” he said. \n",
      "Damascus agreed to eliminate its chemical weapons last year in the face of threatened U.S. military action following a Syrian chemical attack against rebels and their supporters in a civil war aimed at overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad. \n",
      "The United States had developed a portable machine for destroying chemical weapons precursors and offered to neutralize the portion of Syria’s agents that were too toxic to be dealt with directly by companies that process hazardous materials. \n",
      "Syria failed to meet the December 31 deadline for removing the chemical agents, but officials have noted that the time frame was always going to be challenging and arms control experts say deliberate and safe handling of the materials is more important than doing it speedily. \n",
      "“This operation is difficult but it’s do-able,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. “It’s safe and it should be done carefully, and that’s more important than doing it quickly.” \n",
      "Kendall said the Cape Ray, which is part of the Maritime Administration’s Reserve Ready Fleet of cargo ships is expected to leave for the Mediterranean “within about two weeks.” \n",
      "Security concerns and bureaucracy have caused Assad’s government to miss Tuesday’s deadline for the removal of deadly toxins from Syria. Bad weather and a complex multinational procurement effort for equipment are among other reasons given for the delay. \n",
      "The United States is not overly concerned about the delay. \n",
      "“If you think six months ago they didn’t even admit they had chemical weapons, now we have a massive international effort to destroy them and we’ve seen progress,” State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. “I think we’re getting there.” \n",
      "The chemical weapons will be taken from the Syrian port of Latakia to a port in Italy where they will be loaded onto the Cape Ray and destroyed in international waters. \n",
      "Rick Jordan, the Cape Ray’s civilian captain, said the ship had undergone sea trials last week to prove it was ready for the voyage after a period of inactivity. Additional sea trials are planned for next week to test the hydrolysis system while under way and to train the crew for possible emergencies. \n",
      "“We have not tested this on board yet,” he said, motioning to arched tents on the Cape Ray’s lower deck where two Defense Department Field Deployable Hydrolysis Systems have been installed. \n",
      "The ship is expecting to destroy about 700 tons of chemical weapons precursor agents, Kendall said. The actual work could probably be done in 45 days under ideal conditions, but the mission is expected to last about 90 days because work will be suspended in bad weather, he said. \n",
      "The hydrolysis process uses water and other reagents like sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite to neutralize bulk amounts of chemical warfare agents, according to the Defense Department’s Edgewood Chemical Biological Center. \n",
      "The chemically altered agents can then be processed by commercial firms that deal with hazardous waste. Officials said the 700 tons of chemicals, when run through the hydrolysis system, would produce 1.5 million gallons of effluents to be processed by hazardous waste firms. \n",

      "Malaysia's Islamic authorities seize Bibles as Allah row deepens\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Islamic authorities in Malaysia on Thursday seized 321 Bibles from a Christian group because they used the word Allah to refer to God, signaling growing intolerance that may inflame ethnic and religious tension in the Southeast Asian country. \n",
      "The raid comes after a Malaysian court in October ruled that the Arabic word was exclusive to Muslims, most of whom are ethnic Malays, the largest ethnic group in the country alongside sizeable Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities. \n",
      "That ruling overturned a court decision that allowed a Roman Catholic newspaper printed in Malay, the country’s national language, to use Allah. \n",
      "The change has heightened concern that religious authorities, which issue rulings for Muslims and operate alongside civil courts, now have more legal muscle. \n",
      "Analysts say new rulings that affect non-Muslims could be a way of deflecting anger against Prime Minister Najib Razak’s government from poor Malay Muslims over subsidy cuts likely to force up electricity, petrol and sugar prices. \n",
      "On Thursday, the top Islamic authority in the richest and most populous state of Selangor seized the Malay-language Bibles from the Bible Society. The society said authority officials escorted two of its officials to a police station to make statements after which they were released on bail. \n",
      "“We were told that we were under investigation for breaking a Selangor state law banning non-Muslims from using the word Allah,” said Bible Society of Malaysia Chairman Lee Min Choon. \n",
      "The raid is a marked escalation from the occasional seizure at border checkpoints of Bibles imported from Indonesia. It was the first time Islamic authorities have entered premises belonging to a Christian organization to carry out a raid. \n",
      "Christians from Malaysia’s rural states of Sabah and Sarawak in Borneo, who have used the word Allah for centuries, have moved in droves to Selangor and other parts of peninsular Malaysia in recent years to look for work. \n",
      "The main political party within Najib’s ruling coalition, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), said its Selangor members would protest at all churches in the state on Sunday against unauthorized use of the word Allah. \n",
      "“There are laws in Selangor and there was a decree by his Royal Highness the Sultan. So what they are doing is carrying out the Sultan’s decree,” Deputy Prime Minister and UMNO Deputy President Muhyiddin Yassin was quoted by media as saying. \n",
      "“They are not doing anything against the law.” \n",
      "The Sultan of Selangor, one of nine sultans who serve in turn as titular Malaysian head of state, decreed last year that non-Muslims must refrain from using Allah in Bibles. He asked Muslims to unite against “bad elements” that misuse the word. \n",
      "The increasingly assertive stand by holders of the largely ceremonial office show that Muslim leaders have become increasingly vocal about their role in defending Islam. \n",
      "In 2010, arsonists firebombed several churches over the initial ruling that allowed the Catholic newspaper to use the Arabic word. Two Malay men were found guilty for setting fire to one of the churches. \n",

      "Asia's manufacturers buoyant at end 2013, China a question mark\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - Asia’s manufacturing sector ended 2013 on a strong note, with expansion hitting multi-year highs in export-driven Japan and Taiwan, but signs of moderation in China raises concerns about the outlook for the new year. \n",
      "Both official and private measures of manufacturing activity in China fell in December, reinforcing views the world’s second-largest economy lost some steam in the final quarter of 2013. \n",
      "The HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for China slipped to a three-month low of 50.5 in December, consistent with a dip in the government’s PMI to a four-month low of 51.0. Still, both held above the 50 point level that separates expansion from contraction. \n",
      "“The economy is still growing, no doubt, but the growth momentum has weakened,” said Yao Wei, economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong. \n",
      "That could temper some of the optimism about export-dependent countries such as Japan, where the last week the Markit/JMMA Manufacturing PMI rose to a 7-1/2 year high in December. \n",
      "The manufacturing data weighed on Asian shares on Thursday, with the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.6 percent. \n",
      "The PMI report from the euro zone is due at 0858 GMT, while the report for the United States is due at 1358 GMT. \n",
      "Many Asian economies are expecting a pick-up in exports given signs that the U.S. economy, a major market for the region, is on the mend. However, there were mixed signals in the HSBC/Markit PMIs. \n",
      "Taiwanese manufacturers last month posted the sharpest expansion of output since April 2011, and new export orders rose. But in South Korea, new export orders dipped even as overall activity picked up to a seven-month high. \n",
      "In China, both the official and private PMIs showed export orders contracted in December. \n",
      "Data on Wednesday showed South Korea’s exports to China, its biggest market, grew 8.4 percent from a year earlier compared with 13.2 percent for exports to the United States. \n",
      "“The stronger increase in manufacturing output suggests that growth will be sustained over the final quarter of the year, keeping the economy on track for a gradual recovery,” HSBC economist Ronald Man said about South Korea. \n",
      "“But given demand from China has still not shown signs of picking up meaningfully, we believe the overall upswing in economic activity will be limited.” \n",
      "Other PMI surveys showed the more consumer-driven economies of India and Indonesia continued to struggle after a difficult 2013, although there were some glimmers of hope. \n",
      "India’s factories lost momentum as softness in new domestic orders offset a pick-up in demand from abroad. \n",
      "As a result, the HSBC Manufacturing PMI fell to 50.7 in December from 51.3 in the previous month. \n",
      "In Indonesia, manufacturing activity in December improved to 50.9 from 50.3, underpinned by expansion in output and new orders. \n",

      "By Carl Odera and Aaron Maasho \n",
      "JUBA/ADDIS ABABA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - South Sudan’s army (SPLA) said it was advancing on two rebel-controlled towns on Thursday as both sides gathered in Ethiopia for peace talks to end three weeks of violence that has pushed the world’s youngest nation towards civil war. \n",
      "Both sides have agreed in principle to a ceasefire but neither has indicated when the fighting, which has killed more than 1,000 people and displaced nearly 200,000, will stop. \n",
      "South Sudanese President Salva Kiir declared a state of emergency late on Wednesday in Unity state and Jonglei, whose respective provincial capitals of Bentiu and Bor are in the hands of militia loyal to former vice president Riek Machar. \n",
      "A rebel spokesman in Unity dismissed the SPLA’s comments on its advance as lies and said South Sudan’s army and the national government in the capital Juba had resorted to a “war of allegations” before peace negotiations could get underway. \n",
      "International pressure for a peace deal is mounting. Neighbouring countries mediating between the two warring sides have warned  that continued fighting could scupper talks. \n",
      "“We are advancing to Bor because these people want to come to Juba,” SPLA Chief of Staff James Hoth Mai told reporters in the capital. “We don’t yet have a ceasefire and we don’t want them to come and get us.” \n",
      "Bor lies 190 kilometres (118 miles) north of Juba by road. Analysts say control of Bor hands the rebels a territorial base relatively close to Juba, strengthening their negotiating hand. \n",
      "Mai said SPLA troops were also approaching Bentiu after seizing the nearby town of Mayom on Wednesday. A rebel spokesman in Bentiu said Mayom remained in rebel hands, a comment backed up by a spokesman for the United Nations mission in South Sudan. \n",
      "“As of early morning, our understanding was that Mayom was in the hands of troops belonging to Division 4 of the SPLA who have defected to Machar,” the U.N.’s Joe Contreras told Reuters. \n",
      "The clashes erupted on Dec. 15 and quickly spread to half of the country’s 10 states, unsettling oil markets and raising fears of the conflict destabilising an already fragile region. \n",
      "Kiir has accused his long-term political rival Machar, whom he sacked in July, of starting the fighting in a bid to seize power. The conflict has split the country along ethnic lines, between Kiir’s Dinkas and Machar’s Nuer group. \n",
      "Machar denies Kiir’s charge but he has taken to the bush and has acknowledged leading soldiers battling the government. \n",
      "Bor’s Anglican bishop, Ruben Akurdit Ngong, said bodies littered the town, where Nuer militias massacred Dinkas in an outburst of inter-ethnic fighting in 1991. \n",
      "“The town smells terribly of human corpses,” said Ngong, who fled the rebels’ advance on Bor on Sunday after prayers. \n",
      "The SPLA estimates the number of rebels in Bor at between 4,000 and 7,000. \n",
      "Mediators say the talks in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa are meant to focus on how to roll out and monitor a ceasefire. \n",
      "Asked if both sides were genuine about a ceasefire, Andrew Mace, Britain’s acting envoy to Sudan and South Sudan, said more needed to be done to demonstrate that commitment. \n",
      "“(It) looks like they’re still moving for a military advantage rather than preparing a ceasefire,” Mace said. \n",
      "Rebel negotiators are already in Addis Ababa. An Ethiopian  official said only half of the government’s delegation was present, with the remainder due in the city later on Thursday. \n",
      "Each side would meet with Seyoum Mesfin, one of two mediators appointed by the east African bloc IGAD. “Then (they) hopefully proceed to face-to-face talks,” the official added. \n",
      "The White House has raised the pressure for talks, saying there would be accountability for any atrocities and war crimes. \n",
      "The U.N. mission in South Sudan said ethnic-based atrocities, often carried out against civilians by uniformed men, had taken place across the country. \n",

      "* 2013 hottest year recorded in Australia \n",
      "* Farmers slaughtering cattle, heatwave health warnings \n",
      "By Matt Siegel and Colin Packham \n",
      "SYDNEY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - A searing heatwave is baking central and northern Australia, piling more misery on drought-hit cattle farmers who have been slaughtering livestock as Australia sweltered through the hottest year on record in 2013. \n",
      "Temperatures have topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit)in large parts of Australia’s key agricultural regions for most of the past week, with the mercury topping 48 degrees Celsius in the central west Queensland town of Birdsville. \n",
      "The heatwave is moving east across Australia, prompting health warnings on Friday in some of the country’s biggest cities and firefighters were already battling bushfires. \n",
      "But it is in the outback that soaring temperatures have had the most devastating impact, especially on cattle farmers in Queensland, which accounts for about 50 percent on the national herd. \n",
      "“Water supplies are fast diminishing and whatever feed supplies that were left are cooking off to the point where there won’t be any left,” said Charles Burke, a beef farmer and chief executive of Agforce, a Queensland cattle industry group. \n",
      "“This drought is shaping to be an absolute disaster.” \n",
      "Monsoon rains in Australia’s north failed last summer and the entire continent endured its hottest year since records began in 1910, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Friday. \n",
      "Average temperatures were 1.2 degree Celsius above the long-term average of 21.8 degree Celsius, breaking the previous record set in 2005. \n",
      "“The new record high calendar year temperature averaged across Australia is remarkable because it occurred not in an El Niño year, but a normal year,” David Karoly, a climate scientist from the School of Earth Sciences, University of Melbourne, said in an emailed statement. \n",
      "The El Nino weather pattern is a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific and usually brings hot, dry, and often drought conditions to Australia. \n",
      "In the remote town of Marree, 700 kms (435 miles) north of Adelaide in South Australia, one resident tested the folklore that you can fry an egg on the road during an outback heatwave. \n",
      "“You hear stories of people frying an egg on a shovel, so we set up a shovel this morning out the front and sure enough we’ve got an egg there that’s slowly frying away,” publican Phil Turner told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \n",
      "“So yep, we fried an egg on a shovel.” \n",
      "Faced with such tough conditions, farmers are being forced to slaughter more cattle in the current 2013/14 season. \n",
      "Australia’s cattle herd will fall to 25 million head during the 2013/14 season, the lowest since the 2009/10 season, due to increased slaughtering, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences said. \n",
      "“Even the flies are sticking close to the house ... thanks to the air-conditioner coming out the windows,” said Jo Fogarty from Lucy Creek cattle station in the Northern Territory. \n",
      "“(We are) leaving sprinklers on for the dogs and birds at the moment. We are quite lucky we have got a good supply of water at the homestead,” Fogarty told local media. \n",
      "Australia is the world’s third largest beef exporter, with sales during the 2013/14 season tipped to reach A$5.4 billion ($4.82 billion). \n",
      "Should Australian farmers continue to send cattle to slaughter due to the heatwave, future exports could fall as farmers eventually rebuild stocks when conditions improve. \n",
      "The soaring temperatures have also renewed focus on climate change policy in Australia under the new government. \n",
      "While Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said he accepts the reality of climate change, he abolished the country’s Climate Change Commission in September, and rejected any link that global warming was responsible for a series of bushfires across New South Wales state in October. \n",
      "One of Abbott’s major policies is to overturn the previous government’s carbon tax, which was aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to tackle climate change. \n",
      "“On the science perspective, which is the basis for taking action, you’re getting very very mixed messages from this government,” Will Steffen, an adjunct professor at The Australian National University, said in an interview. \n",
      "“I think the first challenge needs to be absolutely clear and consistent messaging from this new government that they understand the science, they accept the science, they accept the risk and they accept the lead to take vigorous and decisive action in getting emissions down.”   (Editing by Michael Perry)\n",

      "Mursi to face trial over jail break case on January 28\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s former Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, will face trial on January 28 over a mass jail break in 2011, one of three cases against him since he was ousted by the army in July, judicial sources said. \n",
      "Since Mursi was deposed, security forces have launched a wide crackdown against his Muslim Brotherhood group, arresting thousands over accusations of inciting violence and designating the group a terrorist organization last month. \n",
      "Mursi has also been charged in connection with the killing of protesters and collaborating with Islamist Hamas group and Hezbollah to carry out a terrorist conspiracy against Egypt. \n",
      "He could face the death penalty over such charges. \n",
      "Mursi, along with other leaders of the Brotherhood, escaped from prison on January 28, 2011, after being rounded up with other Brotherhood leaders during the 18-day uprising that toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak. \n",
      "The first session of his trial is due on the anniversary of that jail break. \n",
      "Mursi won the first post-Mubarak presidential elections in 2012 and ruled Egypt for almost a year before mass protests against his rule prompted the army to overthrow him and appoint an interim government in July. \n",
      "The Brotherhood, once Egypt’s best-organized political and religious movement that won five consecutive elections after Mubarak’s downfall in 2011, denies any links to violence and accuse the army of staging a military coup. \n",
      "Hundreds of pro-Mursi supporters who have demanded his reinstatement have been killed when security forces stormed their protest camps in August. Thousands of others have been rounded up by security forces over accusations of violence. \n",
      "Around 350 police and soldiers have been killed in bombings and shootings since Mursi was deposed. \n",

      "UPDATE 1-CEZ may sign Temelin expansion contract in 2015 - report\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "PRAGUE, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Czech utility CEZ could sign a contract with the winner of a multi-billion dollar tender to expand the Temelin nuclear power plant in the second quarter of 2015, Chief Executive Daniel Benes was quoted as saying. \n",
      "CEZ has delayed picking a supplier, pushing the decision from the end of 2013 to either 2014 or 2015 as it waits for the government to finalise a national energy strategy and negotiates a guaranteed price for power produced by the new plant. \n",
      "In an interview with weekly magazine Ekonom, Benes said talks with the two bidders - Westinghouse, the U.S. unit of Japan’s Toshiba and a consortium including Russia’s Atomstroyexport - would continue. \n",
      "“They could end with the signing of a contract with the winning bidder some time in the second quarter of 2015,” he was quoted as saying. \n",
      "CEZ has been in talks with the state over a guaranteed price for the power, something which the company, analysts and some shareholders see as vital for proceeding with a project estimated to cost around $10 billion. \n",
      "“I cannot imagine that we would sign a fully valid contract for the construction of Temelin before we will have a guaranteed contract for difference or some other business scheme,” he said. \n",
      "“That is a risk into which no company can go.” \n",
      "A plan discussed with the industry ministry under a centre-right government which collapsed in June proposed that CEZ would receive compensation if power prices dropped below a certain level but would have to reimburse the state if prices rose above it. \n",
      "CEZ and Czech officials will also need to watch a European Union investigation into proposed British support for a 16 billion pound nuclear power plant to be built by EDF, which regulators launched this month. \n",
      "Britain has offered EDF a price guarantee lasting 35 years on power from a plant which the French utility plans to build at Hinkley Point in southwest England. \n",
      "“This project is the first of its kind and is an inspiration for us, certainly,” Benes said. \n",
      "He said that talks on energy policy between EU member states in February or March could help decide whether the so-called contract for difference model is a workable scheme. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "* FTSE 100 down 0.4 pct after 14 pct gain in 2013 \n",
      "* Miners slip after disappointing Chinese data \n",
      "* FTSE’s medium-term technical outlook seen positive \n",
      "By Atul Prakash \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A sharp sell-off in mining shares following disappointing Chinese factory data pushed down Britain’s top share index on the first trading day of the year after posting its best annual gain in four years in 2013. \n",
      "The FTSE Mining index fell 1.5 percent, the top decliner on the FTSE 100, after figures showed that factory activity in China, the world’s biggest consumer of metals, slowed in December. \n",
      "Miners BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Antofagasta dropped 1.6 to 2.7 percent, putting pressure on the FTSE 100, which was down 0.4 percent at 6,723.58 points by 1143 GMT. \n",
      "“The mining sector was loveless last year and if you don’t get enough metals demand from markets like China and the United States, you might see the FTSE not getting much higher than it is already. That is a big risk for the market,” David Battersby, investment manager at Redmayne-Bentley, said. \n",
      "“However, in the near term, I would be on the upside for the market. I like those sectors which provide yield, such as infrastructure and financials.” \n",
      "The UK mining sector fell 16 percent last year, against a gain of more than 14 percent for the blue-chip FTSE 100 index,  its best annual gain since 2009. According to a Reuters poll, the benchmark index is likely to hit a new all-time high of 7,100 by end-2014, nearly 6 percent higher from now. \n",
      "Investors were cautious on the mining sector’s outlook, but did not expect a steep sell-off in the coming months. \n",
      "“We’re staying underweight on the mining sector, but we’re not excessively pessimistic on that sector either,” said Brown Shipley chief investment officer Peter Botham. \n",
      "“The Chinese rate of growth will be reduced, but China will still be moving ahead.” \n",
      "Botham said the FTSE 100 would continue to rise this year and would eventually break through the 7,000 point level, which would mark a record high for the index, although he felt overall returns for investors would be lower in 2014 than 2013. \n",
      "Technical analysts also saw gains for the FTSE 100 in the next three months before a retreat. \n",
      "“The monthly candlestick chart shows that the UK index is back at levels that have been reached twice over the last 14 years,” Bill McNamara, technical analyst at Charles Stanley, said, adding the index could break through this resistance area and trade above 7,000 for the first time. \n",
      "He said in a note that charts painted a bullish picture for the market at this point, although the upside limit in the first quarter appeared to be around 7,100, after which the index could become vulnerable to a pull back.\n",

      "LOS ANGELES, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Beyonce’s self-titled album claimed the top spot on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart for the third week running with 310,000 copies sold during the Christmas week, according to figures released Thursday from Nielsen SoundScan. \n",
      "The pop star’s fifth solo album has sold a total of 1.3 million copies in the United States in the 17 days from its surprise release through Dec. 29, the final day for tallying this week’s chart. \n",
      "“Beyonce” is the first album to remain at No. 1 for three weeks since Justin Timberlake’s “The 20/20 Experience” did the same in April, Billboard said. \n",
      "The album, Beyonce’s first since 2011, was released Dec. 13 exclusively through Apple’s iTunes digital music store and was not available in other retailers until Dec. 21. \n",
      "British-Irish boy band One Direction’s “Midnight Memories” moved up one notch to No. 2 with 142,000 copies sold in the week, while rapper Eminem moved to No. 3 from No. 6 with “Marshall Mathers LP 2” selling 122,000 copies. Billboard said both titles likely benefited from redemptions of gift cards for download stores. \n",
      "With Christmas albums like country pop singer Kelly Clarkson’s “Wrapped in Red” and “Duck the Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas” both dropping down in the chart, the soundtrack from the animated movie “Frozen” and Katy Perry’s “PRISM” moved up to round out the top five. \n",
      "Week-over-week album sales dropped 11 percent for the week ending Dec. 29. Sales last week were down 3 percent from the same period last year and album sales for the year were 8 percent lower than 2012. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California’s largest community college won a reprieve on Thursday when a judge temporarily blocked a regulatory agency from stripping City College of San Francisco of its accreditation. \n",
      "The Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges planned to withdraw accreditation from the school next summer, citing a lack of financial accountability and other longstanding problems, none directly related to educational quality. \n",
      "On Thursday, San Francisco Judge Curtis E.A. Karnow issued a preliminary injunction barring the commission from removing the college’s accreditation until a trial is held on a lawsuit filed by City Attorney Dennis Herrera, who alleged that political bias and conflicts of interest unlawfully influenced the agency’s decision. \n",
      "Lost accreditation would trigger funding cuts that would shutter the school, San Francisco’s only community college, with nine campuses, 60 academic degrees and 140 vocational programs, from nursing to culinary arts and aircraft mechanics. Nearly 80,000 students attend classes there. \n",
      "Closing the college would be “catastrophic,” Karnow wrote in a 56-page ruling. \n",
      "“The impact on the teachers, faculty, and the city would be incalculable, in both senses of the term: The impact cannot be calculated, and it would be extreme,” the judge wrote. \n",
      "He plans to begin hearing Herrera’s lawsuit as well as a similar suit brought by unions representing the college’s 1,500 instructors before July. He expressed doubt, however, that the trial would conclude before July 31, the date the college was slated to lose its accreditation. \n",
      "Karnow rejected a separate request for an injunction from the California Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of Teachers, saying that he did not expect the unions to win at trial. \n",
      "The commission’s offices are closed until next week and representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. \n",
      "The U.S. Department of Education authorizes the commission to evaluate 112 community colleges with more than 2 million California students every six years. \n",
      "In 2012, commission members and administrators at the college came down on opposite sides of an ongoing political issue about the role of community colleges, and Herrera’s lawsuit alleges that the commission acted to withdraw accreditation “in retaliation for City College having embraced and advocated a different vision.” \n",

      "Oshie leads Blues to decisive win over Kings \n",
      "ST. LOUIS — A day after he was named to the team that will represent the United States in the Olympics, St. Louis Blues right winger T.J. Oshie was still riding an emotional high. \n",
      "The St. Louis Blues got a key win because of it. \n",
      "Oshie scored two goals in a span of 1:31 in the second period to lead the Blues to a 5-0 win Thursday night over the Los Angeles Kings. \n",
      "The performance came in front of Brian Burke, the director of player personnel for Team USA, who was watching the game from the press box. \n",
      "“He’s putting on a show,” Burke said at the second intermission. “He’s got two goals, he’s won a couple of key face-offs ... killing penalties. He’s a real Swiss Army knife as a player. He does just about everything well. I think he’s excited about being named to the team. \n",
      "“The coaches felt very strongly that they wanted him on the team. So it wasn’t just the management committee that selected the team. They felt very strongly that he should be on the team.” \n",
      "Oshie’s teammates, two of which — center David Backes and defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk — will join him on the U.S. team, could not help but kid Oshie in reminding him that the team auditions were over. \n",
      "“That’s what Stewie (right winger Chris Stewart) told me after the second period,” Oshie said. “It was a great night.” \n",
      "The win was what was more important to the Blues, who have struggled for two years against the Kings, the team that knocked them out of the playoffs the last two seasons. The Blues lost five consecutive regular-season games against Los Angeles and defeated them only three times in 18 games since the start of the 2011 season. \n",
      "“This team is scary to play against with only a one goal lead,” Oshie said. “When they get some momentum they have four lines coming at you pretty hard. We’ve had some tough games against these guys and they’ve given it to us and made us look like little kids out there. To get that big one tonight was good for the guys in the room to know that we can beat those guys. And we are going to have to beat the when it comes down to it.” \n",
      "The Kings are having trouble beating anybody right now. They lost their fifth consecutive game, their longest losing streak of the season, and were shut out for the second time in their last three games. \n",
      "“We played bad,” said Los Angeles defenseman Drew Doughty. “We need to turn it around. We’re down on ourselves, but we can’t be. We need to pick ourselves up. We need to get that confidence back. When our team is playing with confidence, we’re an amazing team. We’ve got to remember that. We’re playing like we’re scared out there. We’re scared to try things. We’re scared to do the right things. That’s why we’re losing. That’s why we got smoked, tonight.” \n",
      "“Anytime you’re losing five games in a row, it’s going to be tough,” Kings right winger Dustin Brown said. “It’s how you respond. It’s easy when things are going right, you’re getting the bounces, it’s easy to sit there and play. It’s time like this when we really need to step up and play our game. Tonight, we didn’t do it.” \n",
      "After the Blues took a 1-0 lead in the first period on a power-play goal by left winger Brenden Morrow, Oshie scored his two quick goals to take some of the pressure off goaltender Brian Elliott, who stopped all 30 Los Angeles shots in earning his third shutout of the season. \n",
      "Oshie, who had not scored two goals in a game in the regular season since Dec. 8, 2011, scored on a power play at 11:41 of the second period off a rebound and added his second goal off a faceoff at 13:12. \n",
      "It also was a good night for Elliott, who came within nine seconds of a shutout in his last game Tuesday night in Minnesota. He raised his record to 11-1-2 for the season with his 12th consecutive home win, a franchise record. \n",
      "“It’s good to get a win and to get a win like that was key for us,” Elliott said. \n",
      "St. Louis left winger Jaden Schwartz, who earned an assist on Oshie’s first goal, failed to score a goal for the first time in seven games. Right winger Vladimir Tarasenko and defenseman Barret Jackman added third-period goals. \n",
      "The win was the 100th behind the Blues bench for Ken Hitchcock and marked the first win for St. Louis in six games against teams from California this season. \n",
      "NOTES: The Blues activated RW Ryan Reaves from injured reserve. Reaves has been out since Nov. 23 because of a broken right hand. ... The Blues also recalled G Jake Allen from their Chicago affiliate in the AHL to serve as G Brian Elliott’s backup because G Jaroslav Halak is battling the flu. ... Los Angeles G Jonathan Quick, who has been out since Nov. 12 because of a groin injury, is traveling with the Kings on their road trip and is listed as day to day. ... The game against the Blues ended a four-game road trip for the Kings, who return home for their next five games, hosting the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night. ... The Blues will host the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday night in their next game.\n",

      "Texas’ great energy success\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      " \n",
      "Texas is America’s energy powerhouse, producing 16 percent of domestic energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration: \n",
      "Although Texas is known for its oil and natural gas production, it is in the area of wind energy that Texas has hit a new milestone. The state opened a massive electricity transmission grid that was built to gather wind energy produced in West Texas and move it to the population centers in East Texas. It is the first to build infrastructure specifically to support industrial scale production of alternative energy. Here is how it happened, according to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) of Texas: \n",
      "Description: The utilities code section 39.904 in conjunction with Senate Bill 20 (2005) established Texas’s Renewable Energy Program and directed the PUC to identify Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ). A CREZ is a geographic area where wind generation facilities will be constructed. In 2008, PUC issued order 33672 designating five CREZs for the generation of wind power and defining the required transmission upgrades to deliver wind generated energy to Texas consumers. \n",
      "Transmission build-out program: The CREZ project is the PUC’s response to a public mandate to increase renewable energy in Texas to serve the electric needs of the state. The Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 7 in 1999, which restructured the state’s electric industry and allowed Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) to offer transmission services to other utilities throughout Texas. Ultimately, the CREZ effort will significantly increase Texas’s current level of wind generation capacity to 18,456 MW.\n",
      " \n",
      "As a result of this multi-decade effort, the wind energy and transmission network is ready to launch: \n",
      "A 3,000-mile network of transmission lines designed to bring wind-generated power from West Texas to homes and businesses from Dallas to San Antonio should be fully operational by Tuesday, year’s end. \n",
      "‘There is a vast amount of wind energy that will suddenly be accessible to cities across Texas,’ said Jeff Clark, executive director of the Wind Coalition, a nonprofit association focused on wind resources throughout the state and the Midwest. \n",
      "Grid operators are on track to have switched on the last of the power lines developed as part of the Competitive Renewable Energy Zones initiative, a $6.8 billion effort that began in 2008. \n",
      "These lines eventually will provide pathways for up to 18,500 megawatts of electricity to travel from thousands of turbines — each as tall as a football field is long — on the windswept plains around San Angelo, Abilene and Amarillo, the Texas Public Utility Commission reports.\n",
      "Reuters reported that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas said that wind energy accounted for 9.2 percent of the power consumed in Texas in 2012, up from 8.5 percent in 2011. Texas continues its dominance in energy production with big infrastructure investments and big returns. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "By Mary Milliken \n",
      "LOS ANGELES, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Hollywood producers nominated slavery drama “12 Years a Slave,”  1970s con-men caper “American Hustle” and space thriller “Gravity” along with seven other films on Thursday for the top Producers Guild Award, a key indicator of sentiment in the race for the best picture Oscar. \n",
      "The other films nominated for outstanding producer in a motion picture were Woody Allen’s tragic comedy “Blue Jasmine,” Somali pirate thriller “Captain Phillips,” AIDS activist drama “Dallas Buyers Club,” quirky computer-age romance “Her,” heartland comedy “Nebraska,” Disney’s making of “Mary Poppins” in “Saving Mr Banks,” and Martin Scorsese’s tale of American greed “Wolf of Wall Street.” \n",
      "Notable snubs included the Coen brothers’ portrayal of the 1960s folk scene “Inside Llewyn Davis” and two films from awards season power player The Weinstein Co. - family dysfunction drama “August: Osage County” and civil rights saga “Lee Daniels’ The Butler.” \n",
      "The Producers Guild Awards will be handed out in a ceremony in Beverly Hills on Jan. 19, six weeks before the March 2 Academy Awards. Oscar nominations will be announced on Jan. 16. \n",
      "The top PGA award can give crucial momentum to a frontrunner. In the last six years, the PGA winner has gone on to win best picture at the Oscars, including last year’s Iran hostage drama “Argo” from director, producer and actor Ben Affleck. \n",
      "In a highly competitive year for film, “American Hustle,” “Gravity” and “Her” have garnered top critics groups awards. But the unflinching portrayal of pre-Civil War slavery from British director and producer Steve McQueen in “12 Years a Slave” is also considered a best picture frontrunner and leads nominations for the Jan. 12 Golden Globe awards alongside “American Hustle” with seven nods a piece. \n",
      "Megan Ellison, the daughter of Silicon Valley billionaire and Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, is a double nominee this year for “American Hustle” from Columbia Pictures and “Her” from Warner Bros Pictures. \n",
      "The 27-year-old Ellison, through her production company Annapurna Pictures, has emerged as a notable force in Hollywood by backing recent successes like “Zero Dark Thirty” and Western remake “True Grit.” \n",
      "Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros., Sony Corp’s  Columbia and Viacom Inc’s Paramount Pictures each had two nominees in the list of 10 motion pictures. \n",
      "In the animation category, the Producers Guild nominated five films for outstanding producer - “The Croods,” “Despicable Me 2,” “Epic,” “Frozen” and “Monsters University.”\n",

      "PARIS, Jan 2 (Reuters) - European stocks slipped on Thursday as soft Chinese and French manufacturing data prompted investors to start new year trading by cashing in a portion of the lofty gains made in 2013. \n",
      "Shares in Italian automaker Fiat bucked the trend, soaring 15 percent in volumes more than five times the stock’s daily average volumes, after it struck a $4.35 billion deal to gain full control of U.S. carmaker Chrysler without raising fresh funds. \n",
      "At 1530 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top  European shares - which gained 16 percent in 2013 - was down 0.6 percent at 1,308.28 points. \n",

      "DEALTALK-Private investors increasingly keen on Ally shares\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "By Peter Rudegeair and Jessica Toonkel \n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Demand for Ally Financial’s  shares has been ramping up, with investors paying increasingly high prices in recent private transactions that signal the U.S. government could be able to sell its remaining stake in the auto lender this year, sources familiar with the situation said. \n",
      "Ally Financial has been hoping to go public since at least 2011. But until now, investors were spooked by the problems that forced it to seek some $17 billion in government bailouts during the financial crisis, including bad home loans at its Residential Capital subprime mortgage unit. \n",
      "As Residential Capital gets ready to emerge from bankruptcy, hedge funds have grown increasingly comfortable that Ally’s problems have cleared up and have bought the company’s shares in two private transactions. The deals signal that the government, which still owns around 64 percent of Ally, may also find good demand for its shares in public markets. \n",
      "Even if it does not, it may be able to sell its shares to private investors, bankers and company executives said. \n",
      "“There might well be enough demand in the private market to take Treasury out in whole,” Ally Chief Executive Michael Carpenter said on a Nov. 5 conference call with analysts. \n",
      "An Ally spokeswoman declined to comment. \n",
      "The U.S. Treasury is open to winding down its remaining investment through an IPO, another private placement or through asset sales, a department spokesman wrote in a Dec. 30 blog post on the Treasury’s website. \n",
      "To be sure, Ally faces headwinds. It is harder for the former General Motors Co lending arm to win business now that it no longer has special agreements to be the preferred lender to customers of Chrysler Group and GM. It has been increasingly relying on used car loans and subprime car loans, which tend to have weaker credit quality, to generate profit growth. \n",
      "The outcome of a few other financial services’ IPOs expected early next year may determine how successful an Ally public offering might be, bankers said. Santander’s U.S. consumer finance business and General Electric Co’s spin-off of its credit card unit will likely come to market early in 2014, and Ally may wait to see how they fare before proceeding with its own IPO, said one industry banker. \n",
      "Private market investors appear to be optimistic about Ally’s prospects. Ally sold $1.3 billion in unlisted shares to private investors in November for an average price of around $6,000 per share, and weeks later GM sold its remaining 8.5 percent stake in Ally for around $6,800 per share. \n",
      "Before the November transaction, Ally had talks with at least one private equity firm about selling shares at a fairly big discount to their book value, a source familiar with the situation said. But hedge funds then unexpectedly bid up the shares, allowing Ally to fetch a valuation closer to its book value, the source said. \n",
      "The hedge funds “opened the flood-gates, and people  saying ‘I will write a check for $6,000 a share,” the source said. “There is a subset of investors buying into the notion that there is a brighter future for Ally.” \n",
      "Between the November and December private transactions, a federal judge approved the plan of Residential Capital, which Ally put into bankruptcy in May 2012, to exit Chapter 11 before the end of the year. To many investors, that signaled that the company had cleared up one of its biggest problems. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch raised Ally’s credit rating on the news, contributing to the higher valuation. \n",
      "Ally’s bonds are rallying too - its notes due in 2020, with a 7.5 percent coupon, have risen 5 cents on the dollar to 117 cents on the dollar since August, according to bond reporting system Trace. \n",
      "The company’s profitability should improve as it continues to cut its funding costs, said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. In the third quarter, Ally’s cost of funds fell 0.57 percentage point from a year earlier. \n",
      "Ally received $17.2 billion in bailout money from the United States during the financial crisis, when it was rescued as part of the government’s efforts to save the U.S. auto industry. The government has recovered $12.3 billion of that money as Ally bought back some shares and paid $3.7 billion in dividends and interest. It is one of the biggest remaining investments in the government’s Troubled Asset Recovery Program bailout fund. \n",
      "While Ally has some control over how it ultimately gets out from under the Treasury’s control, the bank cannot determine  the precise timing. \n",
      "“The timing and the exact method of exit is completely under (the Treasury’s) control, not under our control,” Ally CEO Carpenter said on the Nov. 5 call.\n",

      "COLUMN-Five predictions for financial markets in 2014\n",
      "7 Min Read\n",
      "By Anatole Kaletsky \n",
      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Happy New Year! For the first time since 2008, we investors, economists and businesspeople say these words without irony. While last year was statistically disappointing, with global growth slowing slightly from 2012 and apparently belying the optimism expressed here last January, the verdict of financial markets and business sentiment has been much more consistent with my predictions. Despite the apparent slowdown, stock markets enjoyed their best performance since the 1990s, long-term interest rates soared and consumer confidence all over the world ended 2013 much higher than it started. This apparent paradox is easily explained: the statistical weakness of 2013 was due entirely to a very weak period last winter, connected with the U.S. presidential election and leadership transition in China. By the second quarter, growth had revived in the U.S. and China and accelerated strongly in Britain and Japan. \n",
      "That conventional wisdom last January was far too pessimistic about the economic outlook is evidenced by the subsequent behavior of financial markets, where equities outperformed bonds by the biggest annual margin on record. But today almost everyone is optimistic. So what unexpected developments could surprise financial markets and business sentiment in 2014? Below are five personal guesses - some possibly far-fetched and others are seemingly obvious, but none yet fully reflected in market prices: \n",
      "1. Four is the new two. \n",
      "I think the U.S. economy will grow by about 4 percent, much faster than the 2.5 to 3 percent predicted by the IMF and mainstream economic forecasts. My reasoning is simple. In the last reported quarter, the U.S. economy was already growing by 4.1 percent and the private sector by 4.9 percent. With U.S. budget battles now over and short-term interest rates firmly anchored at zero, there is no reason to expect a slowdown. If the U.S. accelerates to around 4 percent, so will global growth and 4 percent will replace 2 percent as the growth rate assumed in business and financial planning. Global inflation expectations will also rise to around 3 percent, raising the benchmark for global growth in nominal terms to around 7 percent, very similar to the 10 years before the 2008 financial crisis. In other words, the “new normal” of global stagnation widely predicted after the crisis will turn out to be not very different from the old normal. \n",
      "2. The big financial trends of 2013 still have a long way to go. \n",
      "While the gains of over 20 percent in major stock markets may not be repeated this year, equity prices in most of the world should continue rising - and bond prices continue falling. Stock market optimism seems justified for two reasons. Wall Street has now decisively broken a 13-year trading range and past experience, as described in this column last March, strongly suggests that this breakout signals the start of a bull market in global equities that will last for many years. Shifting from history to financial fundamentals, the 6 or 7 percent nominal growth I expect in the global economy should translate into similar growth in corporate revenues and earnings. That would imply similar gains in equity prices, even without any increase in price-earnings multiples or leveraging up of corporate balance sheets through stock buybacks. Given that equity valuations are still only slightly above long-term average levels and that companies are flush with cash, there should be scope for considerably stronger gains in many stock markets. \n",
      "The biggest problem for stock markets will be higher interest rates, since 10-year yields will rise to at least 3.5 percent as the U.S. economy accelerates. But history shows that stock market prices usually rise alongside rising bond yields during periods of economic recovery, provided short-term rates remain low. And luckily for equity investors, the Federal Reserve will maintain its commitment to zero short-term interest rates however much the economy accelerates, because Fed officials see rapid growth as a natural and welcome development after five years of deep recession. \n",
      "3. The European crisis will metastasize from economics into politics. \n",
      "Unfortunately European central bankers have a very different worldview. They see rapid growth as a portent of inflation and will start hinting at tighter money as soon as economic conditions improve. The conflict between strong growth and easy money has already appeared in Britain. It will become a major political problem in 2014, because the improvement in economic activity depends entirely on a property boom that the Bank of England is trying (unsuccessfully) to deflate. As a result, sterling will continue to strengthen, central bank independence will come under pressure and the British economy will become ever more unbalanced, generating the world’s biggest trade deficit relative to GDP. In the euro zone, by contrast, economic conditions will remain feeble at least until the summer, when a shift towards more expansionary monetary and fiscal policies will be triggered by panic in Germany about the big victories for fringe nationalist and neo-fascist parties in May’s European elections. As a result, the euro will weaken and the southern European economies will finally start to recover, but not until the second half of the year. \n",
      "4. Japan will shoot itself in the foot - again. \n",
      "Japan is the major economy most likely to disappoint expectations in 2014, making a mockery of the optimism expressed here last year about Abenomics. The consumption tax increase in April will produce a fiscal tightening worth roughly 2 percent of GDP, after allowing for some feeble offsetting measures. As a result, Japan will probably sink back into recession by the second quarter and the stock market will fall sharply, even though the Bank of Japan will try to ramp up its monetary stimulus and the yen will probably weaken even more. \n",
      "5. Emerging markets will make a comeback - perhaps in unlikely places. \n",
      "With the U.S. accelerating to 4 percent and China growing steadily in the 7 to 8 percent range, emerging markets will come into their own as investors realize that most of these economies have more to gain from robust economic conditions and stronger commodity prices than they have to lose from slightly higher interest rates. There will, of course, be exceptions. Financial problems may intensify in countries with large trade deficits or political mismanagement, such as Turkey and perhaps Brazil.  On the other hand, two major economies now treated as pariahs could do surprisingly well. In Russia, the recent release of Mikhail Khodorkovsky could signal a newfound respect for private property rights. And a nuclear deal with Iran could bring this potentially dynamic economy back into the civilized world, as well as transforming Middle East geopolitics. But at this point, I am probably getting too optimistic even for a New Year pipe dream.\n",

      "Bayer executive sees benefits of R&D; changes as early as 2016\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "FRANKFURT, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Germany’s Bayer  expects a campaign to accelerate the pace of new discoveries of ingredients for pharmaceuticals and pesticides to yield results as early as 2016, a management board member said. \n",
      "“We expect it to be reflected in our pipeline in the next two, three, four, five years,” Wolfgang Plischke, Bayer’s outgoing innovation chief, told Reuters in an interview. \n",
      "Under the project named Nimbus, announced in 2012, Bayer’s human and animal health businesses as well as its CropScience division are being tied together more closely and hundreds of Bayer researchers are encouraged to exchange information that could help in the discovery of new ingredients. \n",
      "Bayer hopes the project will give it an edge over rivals such as Sanofi, Pfizer or Syngenta, which do not have all three business areas under one roof. \n",
      "Bayer has said in the past it plans to provide up to 30 million euros ($41.3 million) per year to finance the Nimbus project. It spent an overall 3.01 billion euros on research in 2012, up from 2.9 billion in 2011. \n",
      "“Our philosophy is to have similar research budgets for the coming years,” Plischke said.\n",

      "Clippers clamp down on Bobcats \n",
      "LOS ANGELES — Defense and a second-half offensive spark propelled the Los Angeles Clippers to an easy 112-85 win over the Charlotte Bobcats on Wednesday. \n",
      "“It was all about defense, energy, (and) we moved the ball,” said Los Angeles point guard Chris Paul, who scored 17 points and handed out 14 assists. “We had a great practice yesterday where we competed. We just talked about moving the ball, and we did that tonight. Things came a little bit easier.” \n",
      "Forward Blake Griffin scored 21 of his 31 points in the second half, and the Clippers rolled to victory at Staples Center. \n",
      "It was the third time in four games Griffin scored 30 or more points. He hit 14 of 20 field-goal attempts against Charlotte. He scored 35 in a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Dec. 26, and he had a season-high 40 points in a win over the Utah Jazz on Saturday. \n",
      "“We have the upmost confidence in (Griffin),” said Paul, who scored all of his points in the second half. “He works so hard. Tonight, (his performance) was unreal. They didn’t know what to do. It was impressive.” \n",
      "Los Angeles forward Jared Dudley finished with 20 points, hitting six of nine 3-point tries and seven of 10 shots overall. Guard Jamal Crawford added 11 points for the Clippers. \n",
      "“Those guys just played really well,” said Charlotte point guard Kemba Walker, who finished with 14 points and seven rebounds. “They picked up their defense and made us take some tough shots that we weren’t able to make. On the offensive end, they played great. They moved the ball really well and they made shots.” \n",
      "Center Al Jefferson also had 14 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for Charlotte (14-19). Guard Gerald Henderson added 12 points, while forward Anthony Tolliver scored 11. \n",
      "The Clippers (22-12) bounced back after suffering their worst defeat of the season Monday night against the Phoenix Suns at Staples Center. Against Charlotte, which dropped its fourth in a row and its 17th consecutive game to a Western Conference opponent, Los Angeles dominated the second half, outscoring the Bobcats 56-29. \n",
      "“We played a championship-caliber team,” Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. “They played a great second half. I thought we played well in the first half. Then they turned up the defense in the second half, our turnovers hurt us, and Blake Griffin shot great. Sometimes, against a team the caliber of this, they get it going. \n",
      "“We’ll learn from it, watch the film, try to get better. But we did some good things.” \n",
      "The score was 56-56 at the break. The Clippers, though, opened the third quarter with a 17-6 run, capped by Dudley’s 3-pointer that gave Los Angeles a 73-62 advantage. \n",
      "Dudley, who struggled recently with his outside shooting, scored 11 points in the third, hitting all four of his field-goal attempts, three of those coming from behind the arc. The Clippers outscored the Bobcats 25-13 in the quarter and took an 81-69 lead into the fourth. \n",
      "“When we play from side to side, we’re a different team,” said Dudley, who had 14 of his points after intermission. “For me, to see the ball go in once or twice breeds confidence.” \n",

      "U.S. permanently relaxes rules aimed at healthier school meals\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators said on Thursday they were permanently relaxing school meal rules that were designed to combat childhood obesity by reining in calories and portion sizes but aroused complaints the policies caused students to go hungry. \n",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture had initially loosened the rules in late 2012, suspending daily and weekly maximum amounts for grains and meat or meal alternatives. That allowed school districts to service larger portions without penalty. \n",
      "“Earlier this school year, USDA made a commitment to school nutrition professionals that we would make the meat and grain flexibility permanent and provide needed stability for long-term planning. We have delivered on that promise,” Kevin Concannon, USDA undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, said in a statement. \n",
      "The announcement was welcomed by North Dakota Republican Senator John Hoeven, who had introduced a bill with Arkansas Democratic Senator Mark Pryor to make the changes permanent. \n",
      "“Today, the USDA made the permanent changes we have been seeking to the School Lunch Program,” Hoeven said in a statement. “A one-size-fits-all approach to school lunch left students hungry and school districts frustrated with the additional expense, paperwork and nutritional research necessary to meet federal requirements. These are exactly the changes included in our Sensible School Lunch Act.” \n",
      "The rules had initially been adopted in 2012 as part of a law designed to improve school breakfasts and lunches. The modifications were aimed at limiting fat and salt, reducing portion sizes and increasing fruit and vegetable servings. Some 31 million children in the United States receive free or low-cost school lunches and more than 10 million get free or discounted breakfasts. \n",
      "Schools are an important focus because they provide meals to many low-income students, considered to be often the most at risk for being overweight or obese. \n",

      "TORONTO (Reuters) - Alicia Keys and BlackBerry Ltd will cut ties at the end of January, just one year after the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter was hired as a “global creative director” for the struggling smartphone maker. \n",
      "The Canadian company on Thursday confirmed the singer’s upcoming departure. The move comes as BlackBerry retreats from the consumer market to focus on businesses, governments and other large organizations. \n",
      "“BlackBerry and Alicia Keys have completed our year-long collaboration,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We have enjoyed the opportunity to work with such an incredibly talented and passionate individual.” \n",
      "Keys was hired when the company launched its long-delayed BlackBerry 10 devices in January of last year. \n",

      "Catalan president calls on EU leaders to support push for independence\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia’s president has called on European Union prime ministers for support as the region seeks a vote on independence in November this year, the source of an increasingly bitter fight with Spain’s central government. \n",
      "In letters dating from December and made public on Thursday, Artur Mas urged European powers to encourage a referendum that the center-right government of Mariano Rajoy says is unconstitutional and it will not allow. \n",
      "The Catalan struggle is likely to dominate the political agenda this year in Spain, which is slowly emerging from a recession and heading towards a general election in 2015. \n",
      "“Contrary to some reports, there are a number of legal and constitutional options which allow this referendum to take place in Catalonia,” Mas wrote in a December 20 letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which was reproduced on his official website and is one of 27 sent to European leaders. \n",
      "“I am confident I can rely on you to encourage the peaceful, democratic, transparent, and European process to which I and a vast majority of the Catalan people are fully committed,” he wrote. \n",
      "Scotland is due to vote on independence this year, though Mas made no mention of the British parallel in his note. \n",
      "Other than embarrassing Spain’s central government, the international campaign also has a tactical aim, with Catalan’s ruling party and citizens groups eyeing an end-game possibly played out in an international tribunal. \n",
      "With Rajoy and Mas showing no signs of reaching a political negotiation, Rajoy is expected to use the national parliament and Supreme Court to block any move to hold a referendum. \n",
      "In that case, Mas may well have to call early elections, likely to be won by the more radical independence party the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), opinion polls show. ERC leaders say they will take their battle for a referendum to an international court if need be. \n",
      "Separately from the letters to EU leaders, the regional government also sent 45 memorandums to foreign countries in December listing its attractions as an export-led economy at the heart of the EU - of which it wants to remain a member. \n",
      "Opinion polls have shown mixed support for Catalan independence within the region, with some recently showing only 35 percent would vote for a full break-away from Spain while others have shown support of close to 50 percent. \n",
      "But polls have shown overwhelmingly that Catalans want the right to decide and believe that Rajoy should authorize a vote. \n",

      "The Utah Jazz look for their 12th consecutive home victory over Milwaukee when they host the Bucks on Thursday. Milwaukee hasn’t won in Utah since the beginning of the 2001-02 campaign and the Bucks are just 4-12 on the road this season even after beating the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday. The Jazz still have the worst record in the Western Conference after winning four of their last seven while Milwaukee owns the worst mark in the East. \n",
      "Utah’s improved play has come with the emergence of point guard Trey Burke as a scorer, and the team is 5-1 when Burke scores 20 or more points. Burke matches up against Milwaukee’s Brandon Knight, who shredded the Lakers for a career-best 37 points in the victory. Knight has scored in double figures in a career-best nine consecutive games and also had a 36-point outing against the New York Knicks during the stretch. \n",
      "TV: 9 p.m. ET, FSN Wisconsin (Milwaukee), ROOT (Utah) \n",
      "ABOUT THE BUCKS (7-24): Knight is putting up 23.7 points over the last seven games and is averaging a career-best 15 points in his third NBA season. He spent his first two campaigns with the Detroit Pistons and started slowly this season - he averaged 9.6 points in November – before picking up the pace with a strong December. He carried the Bucks with 18 third-quarter points in the victory over the Lakers. “My teammates did a great job of running the floor and running the lanes and creating plays for one another,” said Knight, “and I think that opened it up for me and a lot of other guys.” \n",
      "ABOUT THE JAZZ (10-24): Burke is averaging 17 points over the last five games and recently began taking more shots in pressure situations. In Utah’s Monday win over Charlotte, he dribbled away the time before going into attack mode and made a key driving bank shot with 19.1 seconds left just as the shot clock expired to give the Jazz a three-point lead in a game they ended up winning 83-80. “The other players and Coach (Tyrone Corbin) told me to stay aggressive and to pick and choose my spots,” Burke said after the 21-point outing. \n",
      "1. The Bucks defeated the Jazz last March to snap a four-game skid in the series. \n",
      "2. The victory over the Lakers was Milwaukee’s first of the season against a Western Conference club. \n",

      "Similar messages were posted on Skype’s official Facebook pages and on a blog on its website before being taken down later in the afternoon. Skype is owned by Microsoft Corp. \n",
      "The Syrian Electronic Army, an amorphous hacking collective that supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, later claimed the attack. \n",
      "The SEA also posted on its Twitter feed the contact information of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s retiring chief executive, along with the message: “You can thank Microsoft for monitoring your accounts/emails using this details. #SEA” \n",
      "That message was a reference to revelations last year by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, was part of the NSA’s program to monitor communications through some of the biggest U.S. Internet companies. \n",
      "“We recently became aware of a targeted cyber attack that led to access to Skype’s social media properties, but these credentials were quickly reset,” a spokeswoman for Skype said in a statement released on Thursday. “No user information was compromised.” \n",
      "The NSA’s practices essentially made Microsoft and other technology companies partners in government surveillance efforts against private citizens. The company last month joined seven other top technology firms in pressing President Barack Obama to rein in the U.S. government’s electronic spying. \n",
      "A U.S. district judge in December ruled the U.S. government’s gathering of Americans’ phone records was likely unlawful and raised “serious doubts” about the value of the so-called metadata counterterrorism program. \n",
      "A second federal judge ruled later in the month the program was constitutional, raising the possibility the issue would be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. \n",

      "Arizona State, which picked up impressive non-conference victories over Marquette and UNLV, opens Pac-12 play with a home game against Washington on Thursday. On paper, it would appear the Sun Devils should be big favorites to open conference play with a win except for the fact that Washington, winner of three of its last four, has defeated Arizona State seven straight times. The Sun Devils last win over the Huskies was 68-51 on Jan. 8, 2010. \n",
      "Arizona State brings a four-game win streak into the contest since losing to defending ACC champion Miami (Fla.), 60-57, on Dec. 1. The Sun Devils’ only other loss was to Creighton in the Wooden Legacy Tournament. Washington is 7-4 in Pac-12 openers under Lorenzo Romar while ASU is 3-4 in that spot under Herb Sendek. \n",
      "TIME: 8 p.m. ET, ESPNU \n",
      "ABOUT WASHINGTON (8-5): Senior guard C.J. Wilcox ranks second in the Pac-12 in scoring (20.5) and is shooting 41.1 percent from 3-point range. He holds the school record for 3-pointers made (246). Freshman Nigel Williams-Goss, a 2013 McDonald’s All-American and a four-year starter on three national champion prep squads at Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nev., is off to a good start, averaging 12.6 points while dishing off a team-best 4.4 assists. \n",
      "ABOUT ARIZONA STATE (11-2): Guard Jahii Carson, the Pac-12 co-Freshman of the Year last season, has NBA scouts drooling. He leads the Sun Devils in scoring (19.3) and assists (5.4), is shooting 51.4 percent from 3-point range and had 40 points in a 86-80 victory at UNLV. Jordan Bachynski, a 7-2 senior, is averaging almost a double-double (12.5 points, 9.8 rebounds) and has a NCAA-leading 63 blocks. \n",

      "MEXICO CITY, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Mexico’s manufacturing sector sentiment rose to its highest in 10 months in December, a survey showed on Thursday, as increases in new orders and output suggested a nascent economic recovery may gain more steam. \n",
      "The HSBC Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index  rose to 52.6 in December, after adjusting for seasonal variation, from a downwardly revised 51.9 in November. \n",
      "A reading above 50 signals expansion, while a lower reading points to contraction. \n",
      "New orders posted their strongest pace of expansion since March on higher demand while output expanded by the most since February. \n",
      "Still the monthly indicator remained below its series average of 53.6. \n",
      "“This result seems to confirm the nascent recovery in the manufacturing sector,” said Sergio Martin, chief economist at HSBC in Mexico. \n",
      "Mexico’s economy rebounded in the third quarter, growing at its fastest pace in more than a year, while rising exports in November pointed to further recovery after a sharp slowdown in the first half of the year.

      "BEIJING/SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Asia’s manufacturing sector ended 2013 on a strong note, with expansion hitting multi-year highs in export-driven Japan and Taiwan, but signs of moderation in China raises concerns about the outlook for the new year. \n",
      "Both official and private measures of manufacturing activity in China fell in December, reinforcing views the world’s second-largest economy lost some steam in the final quarter of 2013. \n",
      "The HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for China slipped to a three-month low of 50.5 in December, consistent with a dip in the government’s PMI to a four-month low of 51.0. Still, both held above the 50 point level that separates expansion from contraction. \n",
      "“The economy is still growing, no doubt, but the growth momentum has weakened,” said Yao Wei, economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong. \n",
      "That could temper some of the optimism about export-dependent countries such as Japan, where the last week the  Markit/JMMA Manufacturing PMI rose to a 7-1/2 year high in December. \n",
      "The manufacturing data weighed on Asian shares on Thursday, with the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.6 percent. \n",
      "The PMI report from the euro zone is due at 0858 GMT, while the report for the United States is due at 1358 GMT. \n",
      "Many Asian economies are expecting a pick-up in exports given signs that the U.S. economy, a major market for the region, is on the mend. However, there were mixed signals in the HSBC/Markit PMIs. \n",
      "Taiwanese manufacturers last month posted the sharpest expansion of output since April 2011, and new export orders rose. But in South Korea, new export orders dipped even as overall activity picked up to a seven-month high. \n",
      "In China, both the official and private PMIs showed export orders contracted in December. \n",
      "Data on Wednesday showed South Korea’s exports to China, its biggest market, grew 8.4 percent from a year earlier compared with 13.2 percent for exports to the United States. \n",
      "“The stronger increase in manufacturing output suggests that growth will be sustained over the final quarter of the year, keeping the economy on track for a gradual recovery,” HSBC economist Ronald Man said about South Korea. \n",
      "“But given demand from China has still not shown signs of picking up meaningfully, we believe the overall upswing in economic activity will be limited.” \n",
      "Other PMI surveys showed the more consumer-driven economies of India and Indonesia continued to struggle after a difficult 2013, although there were some glimmers of hope. \n",
      "India’s factories lost momentum as softness in new domestic orders offset a pick-up in demand from abroad. \n",
      "As a result, the HSBC Manufacturing PMI fell to 50.7 in December from 51.3 in the previous month. \n",

      "JERUSALEM, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Perion Network Ltd   said it was targeting annual revenue of $1 billion in the next five years following the acquisition of Conduit Ltd’s ClientConnect business. \n",
      "Israel-based Perion on Thursday completed the purchase in an all-stock deal worth $660 million, giving the company a platform designed to give mobile application (app) publishers and developers a way of improving their distribution and money-making capabilities. \n",
      "Josef Mandelbaum, Perion’s chief executive, said about a quarter of mobile apps never get downloaded - except perhaps by the developer’s friends and family - while 98 percent of apps earn less than $5,000 a year. \n",
      "Citing studies, Perion also said 76 percent of consumers find free versions of apps sufficient. \n",
      "“The toughest thing is getting traffic and making money,” Mandelbaum said in an interview with Reuters. \n",
      "Perion shares, which rose 35 percent in 2013 on top of a 126 percent advance in 2012, were up 3 percent by 1520 GMT on Nasdaq. \n",
      "Mandelbaum said the acquisition of the much larger ClientConnect would allow Perion to help more mobile apps find paying customers. Perion, he noted, was able to make money from its main products - IncrediMail and Smilebox - through search partnerships with Yahoo! Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp’s Bing. \n",
      "“My plan three years ago was to build a billion dollar company in Israel,” said Mandelbaum. “My internal goal is it will take three to five years to get there.” \n",
      "On its own, Perion - founded in 2000 and whose key shareholders include Benchmark Capital and JP Morgan Chase  - is expected to post 2013 revenue of between $102 and $104 million, up from $61 million in 2012. Including ClientConnect, 2013 revenue would be about $400 million. \n",
      "Mandelbaum declined to give an outlook for 2014 but said the company expects to grow sales and profit, especially as the ClientConnect deal is immediately positive for earnings. \n",
      "“This deal is a great stepping stone,” Mandelbaum said. “We are not where we want to be yet. We have to do more investments and acquisitions to fill in the gaps.” \n",
      "He said Perion aims to improve its presence in the mobile sector, a tougher area for advertising than on desktop computers, and in analytics. \n",
      "“We haven’t even scratched the surface,” he added. “We have terrabytes of data to help ourselves and publishers make more money.”\n",

      "Panama presses Spain and Italy to resolve canal cost row\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "PANAMA CITY/MADRID (Reuters) - The president of Panama said on Thursday he would go to Spain and Italy to pressure companies to honor contracts to expand his country’s canal after a building consortium behind the project threatened to suspend work because of a row over costs. \n",
      "The consortium - Spain’s Sacyr, Italy’s Salini Impregilo, Belgium’s Jan De Nul and Panama’s Constructora Urbana - said on Wednesday that $1.6 billion in cost overruns on the $3.2 billion plan to build a third set of locks for the canal should be met by Panama. \n",
      "The consortium, known as Grupo Unidos por el Canal, said the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) had 21 days to respond to its demands during which work would continue, but the project would be suspended if that requirement was not met. \n",
      "Just a few hours later, the PCA rejected the demand, hinting it could find others to complete the job. Shares in Sacyr, which heads the consortium, slumped 9 percent on Thursday. \n",
      "Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli accused the companies of “great irresponsibility” and said they had endangered the massive construction project, which has been a major driver of the Central American nation’s economy. \n",
      "Martinelli, who took power in 2009, said he expected Italy and Spain to uphold commitments to back the project which the countries’ leaders made to him during his first year in office. \n",
      "“So I’m going to go to Spain and Italy to demand this from them, because a company should not be able to put such a high amount of overrun costs on a project that belongs to humanity,” he told reporters in Panama City. \n",
      "The Spanish and Italian governments have a “moral responsibility” to help resolve the dispute because their companies were engaged in the construction, Martinelli said. \n",
      "Jorge Quijano, the head of the PCA, said if the project were delayed due to the dispute, Panama would see it through. \n",
      "“This work will be finished, never fear, even if it takes longer to complete,” he told reporters. \n",
      "Panama has already moved back the scheduled completion date for the expansion from October 2014 into mid-2015. \n",
      "To see that the work was concluded, Quijano said the PCA had since November been in contact with insurer Zurich in North America, with which it had $600 million in surety bonds that could be used to support the project. \n",
      "In addition, the PCA could tap the $1.2 billion it had not yet paid to the consortium to finish the work, he added. So far the PCA had only paid the contractors $2 billion, he said. \n",
      "The new locks represent the biggest chunk of the canal expansion plan, which overall is worth some $5.3 billion. \n",
      "The PCA says the total expansion is just over 70 percent finished with the locks 65 percent complete. The canal’s extension aims to broaden and deepen existing channels so that more and bigger vessels can sail through. \n",
      "The consortium said the overruns were due to unforeseen events during construction, which it said was “normal” in such projects. It also said the PCA had failed in its obligations and given the consortium “inexact” information for the project. \n",
      "But the PCA said that if the consortium was not capable of honoring its agreements, it would initiate “mechanisms from the contract that would allow the work to be completed.” \n",
      "It did not explain what those would be. \n",
      "Sacyr won the bid on the canal contract in 2009 with a $3.12 billion offer, which was considerably lower than that of rivals, as well as below the $3.48 billion reference set by the PCA. \n",
      "Political columnist Pepe Oneto, writing in opinion blog republica.com, said the news was terrible for Spain’s attempt to rebuild its image abroad following a severe economic crisis with the collapse of the country’s building and property sector. \n",
      "“The Spanish government ... knew that it was impossible for the budget to be met. Sacyr bid low, convinced that, in the end, the cost overruns it is demanding now would be met,” he said. \n",
      "A spokesman for Sacyr said that part of the cost overrun was because some building materials as originally budgeted were not adequate for the final work. The PCA had rejected the concrete mix the consortium had planned to use for the project. \n",
      "“The consortium’s intention is also to find a solution within the terms of the contract, as there are mechanisms that make it possible,” Sacyr’s spokesman said, without elaborating. \n",
      "The company’s debts at the end of September were three times its market capitalization. Analysts at the brokerage of Banco Sabadell said the news was not good for Sacyr or its image, but played down the impact on the builder’s results. \n",
      "Newspaper El Pais reported in 2009 that Panama’s foreign minister, Juan Carlos Varela, had predicted the project would fail because the builders were in financial trouble. \n",
      "Sacyr made 55 percent of its revenue outside Spain in the first nine months of 2013, and Panama contributed 25 percent of its 1.3 billion euros ($1.78 billion) in international sales, the company said in its 2013 nine month earnings. \n",

      "* PMI data shrinks Italian, Spanish spreads \n",
      "* Bund yields hit highest since September 2013 \n",
      "* T-note/Bund yield spread may widen further-analyst \n",
      "By Marius Zaharia and Ana Nicolaci da Costa \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The premiums Italian and Spanish bonds offer over benchmark German Bunds fell to their lowest since mid-2011 on Thursday after manufacturing surveys beat expectations in both southern euro zone countries. \n",
      "While overall euro zone Purchasing Managers Index surveys came in line with forecasts in Reuters polls showing manufacturing grew at its fastest rate in 2-1/2 years, data on Italy and Spain surprised on the upside. \n",
      "“PMIs in Italy and Spain were better than expected and we see people switching out of core bonds into peripheral bonds,” said Rabobank market economist Emile Cardon. \n",
      "“Investors are asking themselves: why should I invest in Germany when I get double the yield in Italy or Spain?” \n",
      "Low volumes after the Christmas and new year holidays exacerbated price moves. \n",
      "The numbers helped drive the yield premium for Spanish 10-year bonds over Bunds 18 basis points lower to 205 bps. The Italian/German yield spread  shrank 12 bps to 204 bps. \n",
      "By contrast, top-rated bonds started 2014 in a cautious mood after ending last year rattled by an improving economic outlook and by the U.S. Federal Reserve decision to start trimming its bond-buying stimulus programme this year. \n",
      "“There is a feeling that new money will continue to support risk and high-yield assets and that’s borne out a little bit from some of the early flows at the start of the year,” one trader said. \n",
      "German 10-year Bund yields were 1.5 basis points higher at 1.94 percent, having earlier hit their highest since September at 1.969 percent. Bund futures fell 5 ticks to a settlement close of 139.12. \n",
      "Volumes remained low, with about 273,000 lots having traded in the Bund futures market this session, compared with a 2013 daily average of about 680,000 lots. \n",
      "Still, stubbornly low inflation in the euro zone and other major economies as well as promises by the Fed and the European Central Bank to keep interest rates low for a long period are expected to cap German and U.S. yields. \n",
      "Some analysts expect the ECB to ease monetary policy further, especially if falling excess liquidity levels in the banking system keep money market rates elevated. \n",
      "Eonia, the overnight euro zone bank-to-bank lending rate, ended 2013 at a two-year high of 0.446 percent due to seasonally thin liquidity. Analysts expected it to fall in coming days, but the extent of the drop could spark some speculation about further ECB monetary policy easing. \n",
      "DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk does not expect the ECB to make any move in the near term, but says the central bank will continue to strike a soft tone, leading to a widening of the yield gap between Bunds and U.S. Treasuries. \n",
      "“We can expect a further widening of the transatlantic spread. The Fed will be less dovish as it starts tapering and the ECB most likely will remain pretty friendly,” he said. \n",

      "EFG said Ellaicy would assume his duties immediately having served at Orascom Telecom as CFO for two years. It noted he had also been CFO of Bahraini telecoms group Batelco, but did not say who he was replacing. \n",
      "“Khalid has proven capabilities in managing cost efficiency, improving profitability and increasing shareholder value,” Karim Awad, co-CEO of EFG, said in a statement. “In his new role he will help ensure that we continue to operate as a lean organization with maximum efficiency across all lines of business.” \n",
      "EFG also said it had recently acquired a 65 percent stake in Credit Libanais as it seeks to expand into retail and commercial banking. \n",
      "The move comes eight months after the failure of a planned tie-up with Qatar’s QInvest, under which EFG would have spun off some of its assets to create an investment bank with operations spanning the Middle East, Africa and Turkey. \n",
      "No-one at EFG could immediately be reached for further comment. \n",
      "Shares in EFG, which said in November its third-quarter net profit rose 38 percent from a year earlier to 116 million Egyptian pounds ($16.8 million), were trading 1 percent higher by 0950 GMT.\n",

      "By Aaron Maasho and Carl Odera \n",
      "ADDIS ABABA/JUBA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - South Sudan’s army (SPLA) advanced towards the rebel-controlled town of Bor on Thursday, its spokesman said, as both sides gathered in Ethiopia for peace talks to end three weeks of violence that has pushed the country towards civil war. \n",
      "Both sides have agreed in principle to a ceasefire but neither has indicated when the fighting, which has killed more than 1,000 people and displaced nearly 200,000, will stop. \n",
      "South Sudanese President Salva Kiir declared a state of emergency late on Wednesday in Unity state and Jonglei, whose capital Bor fell on Tuesday into the hands of militia loyal to former vice president Riek Machar. \n",
      "International pressure for a deal is mounting. Neighbouring countries mediating between the two warring sides have warned  that continued fighting could scupper talks. \n",
      "“The rebels are moving south from Bor and the SPLA is moving towards Bor,” SPLA spokesman Philip Aguer told Reuters. \n",
      "Bor lies 190 kilometres (118 miles) to the north of the capital Juba by road. Analysts say control of Bor hands the rebels a territorial base relatively close to Juba, strengthening its negotiating hand. \n",
      "Aguer declined to say how many government troops were moving towards Bor, where Nuer militias massacred Dinkas during an outburst of ethnic fighting in 1991. He estimated the number of rebels in Bor at between 4,000 and 7,000. \n",
      "SPLA troops are also reorganising to win back Bentiu, the capital of Unity state in the country’s north, Aguer said. \n",
      "The peace talks in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa are meant to focus on finding ways to roll out and monitor the ceasefire, mediators said. \n",
      "“Only half of the government’s delegation are here. The rest are set to arrive this evening,” said an Ethiopian official. \n",
      "Each side would meet with Seyoum Mesfin, one of two mediators appointed by the east African bloc IGAD. “Then (they) hopefully proceed to face-to-face talks,” the official added. \n",
      "The clashes in South Sudan erupted on Dec. 15 and quickly spread to half of the country’s 10 states, unsettling oil markets and raising fears of the conflict spilling over in an already fragile region. \n",
      "Kiir has accused his long-term political rival Machar, whom he sacked in July, of starting the fighting in a bid to seize power. The conflict has split the country along ethnic lines, between Kiir’s Dinkas and Machar’s Nuer group. \n",
      "Machar has denied Kiir’s charge but he has taken to the bush and has acknowledged leading soldiers battling the government. \n",
      "“We don’t want to expose the people of South Sudan to a senseless war,” South Sudan’s Foreign Minister Barnaba Marial Benjamin said on Wednesday. \n",
      "The White House raised the pressure for talks this week, saying there would be accountability for any atrocities and war crimes. \n",

      "The line, under construction since 2010, will run 207 km (127 miles) from Shenyang to the border city of Dandong, which faces North Korea across the Yalu River, and will shorten the train journey from 3 1/2 hours to one hour, the official Xinhua news agency said. \n",

      "Reinsurers face 2014 premium slide: Willis Re\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - Reinsurers could be hit with up to a 25 percent decline in premium revenue over the next 12 months after the number of natural and man-made disasters dropped by half in 2013, a study by reinsurance broker Willis Re said. \n",
      "As well as the relative lack of costly catastrophes, the market remained hampered by oversupply as pension funds and hedge funds increasingly look to offer reinsurance for insurers looking to reduce their potential claims exposure. \n",
      "“The key influence on the January 1 renewals has been overcapacity triggered by a number of converging factors,” Willis Re CEO John Cavanagh said, citing strong results from reinsurers and the increase in capital from non-traditional sources, which he said totaled $50 billion. \n",
      "That trend was compounded by muted demand from buyers as a result of regulatory changes and as leading insurance groups looked to keep more risk on their own books. \n",
      "“A heady cocktail of converging factors has fuelled a soft buyers’ market in nearly all lines of business,” Willis Re said in its 1st View Renewals Report. \n",
      "The biggest hit, of between 10 percent and 25 percent, would be to U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance after a relatively benign hurricane season,” it said. European premiums, meanwhile, could fall by between 10 percent and 15 percent. \n",
      "Hannover Re (HNRGn.DE) last week said it expected premiums to fall in 2014, fuelling concern about a possible price war with peers Swiss Re SRENH.VX, Munich Re (MUVGn.DE) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) to protect market share. \n",
      "In response, some reinsurers have been looking to offer more complex deals, branching out into specialty areas of the market or offering underwriting services to the alternative investors, Willis Re Chairman Peter Hearn said. \n",
      "Faced with the challenge of increasing revenues in such an environment, a number of firms are expected to take a fresh look at mergers and acquisitions, Willis Re added. \n",

      "Bruins pull out OT win over Predators\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "Bruins pull out OT win over Predators \n",
      "BOSTON — Whatever Boston Bruins coach Claude Julien said to his team between the second and third period on Thursday night worked. \n",
      "“We just started to play our game — tried not to be too fancy and just get pucks and bodies to the net,” defenseman Johnny Boychuk said after left winger Brad Marchand scored 54 seconds in overtime as the Bruins pulled out a 3-2 win over the Nashville Predators. \n",
      "“The second period wasn’t our best; you only have three shots and you can’t really win when you only have three shots obviously. We just tried to get on the rush when you can and try and get more pucks and bodies to the net and limit the turnovers.” \n",
      "It worked, and it made a winner of goalie Niklas Svedberg in his NHL debut. \n",
      "Down 1-0 and outshot 16-3 in the second period, the Bruins came out a different team in the third. Goals by Boychuk, his first in 19 games, and right winger Jarome Iginla, his 13th of the season, gave Boston the lead with 7:31 left. \n",
      "Nashville defenseman Shea Weber, who assisted on his team’s first goal, tied it with his 10th goal of the year with 5:25 left to send the game to overtime. \n",
      "As he has done in the past, Julien went with three forwards and one defenseman in the OT 4-on-4. On the second shift, Marchand, shaken by a heavy Weber hit in the third period, made a great move to get around center Mike Fisher before beating goaltender Marek Mazanec with his 10th goal of the season. \n",
      "“Fish knows better than that,” said coach Barry Trotz. “He can’t play as light on guys one on one as that, but on all the goals, our forwards were light on people tonight.” \n",
      "Said Fisher, who set up both Nashville goals and has eight points in the last three games: “It was just a bad play by me ... I’d like that back, but what do you do?” \n",
      "Trotz added: “The people who put us back in the game were Fisher, and our leadership, Weber scoring a big goal, it was our veteran leadership group that got us back in there.” \n",
      "The victory allowed the Bruins to avoid their first three-game losing streak of the season, and came after Tuukka Rask had lost two straight in goal. \n",
      "“Ever since I started playing this is where I wanted to be so I’m real happy with this win,” said Svedberg, who made 33 saves. “It’s just one game but it’s real fun to get the win in my first game.” \n",
      "Nashville had a two-game winning streak stopped and still got a point. \n",
      "Svedberg was supposed to debut last Saturday night at Ottawa. But a roster problem, created when defenseman Zdeno Chara couldn’t play that night, forced the team to send Svedberg back to Providence after the game. \n",
      "“He’s going to head back to Providence, but there’s a good chance you’re going to see him here again very soon,” Julien said. \n",
      "“He just showed he’s a guy we need to look at, keep an eye on and consider.” \n",
      "Svedberg wasn’t severely tested early, but did get a break when right winger Craig Smith’s power-play slapper rang off the crossbar in the first period. The Bruins then got sloppy late in a second period, which has been a problem period for them all season. They have outscored the opposition 35-23 in the first and 48-29 in the second but have been outscored 34-32 in the second. \n",
      "A bad line change led to the first NHL goal allowed by Svedberg. Weber got the puck to Fisher, whose sharp-angle shot was stopped. The rebound came right out to Viktor Stalberg, who buried it at 18:04 of the second. \n",
      "It was Stalberg’s fifth goal of the season but first in eight games. It was his first game back in Boston since winning the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks in the spring. \n",
      "NOTES: D Dougie Hamilton (knee) and LW Carl Soderberg (head) returned to the Bruins’ lineup. Soderberg missed the previous two games for what was believed to be a concussion, but he said he was not concussed. Hamilton missed the previous 10 games and had an assist on the winning goal. ... The Predators signed D Jonathan Ismael-Diaby, a third-round pick in the 2013 draft, to a three-year entry-level contract. ... The Bruins began a stretch of five consecutive games and eight of the next nine against the Western Conference. They host the Winnipeg Jets on Saturday and then play five of their next six on the road, starting with three in California. ... The Predators opened a three-game road trip. They visit Florida to play the Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. ... Linesmen Lonnie Cameron and Mark Wheler, already working their second straight game in Boston, were told, because of the storm, to stay in Boston and work Saturday’s game as well.\n",

      "Bears re-sign quarterback Cutler on seven-year deal\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - The Chicago Bears ended media speculation about their quarterback position on Thursday by announcing Jay Cutler had agreed a seven-year contract to remain with the National Football League team. \n",
      "Cutler, who could have become an unrestricted free agent, \n",
      "is now signed through the 2020 season. \n",
      "“Very excited to have Jay for the long term,” general manager Phil Emery told a news conference. \n",
      "Emery said three other players headed for free agency in March had also been signed to new deals - kicker Robbie Gould, cornerback Tim Jennings and left guard Matt Slauson. \n",
      "Cutler, 30, recorded a career-high 89.2 quarterback rating in 2013, completing 63.1 percent of his passes for 2,621 yards with 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 11 games. \n",
      "The strong-armed quarterback missed five games this season with a torn groin muscle and an ankle sprain, with back-up Josh McCown ably filling in as the Bears (8-8) came within a final-game loss to the Green Bay Packers of qualifying for the playoffs. \n",
      "In five seasons with the Bears, Cutler has become the franchise’s all-time leader in most passing categories including completions, attempts, yards and QB rating. \n",
      "His record as a starter since arriving in 2009 in a trade with the Denver Broncos is 39-28. \n",

      "UPDATE 5-Heavy snow, dangerous cold snarl travel in northeastern U.S.\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "(Updates with Cuomo and de Blasio comments, states of emergency) \n",
      "By Elizabeth Dilts and Scott Malone \n",
      "NEW YORK/BOSTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The governors of New York and New Jersey declared a state of emergency and urged residents to stay indoors as a major storm hit the northeastern United States on Thursday, bringing heavy snow and delaying or canceling thousands of flights. \n",
      "The first major winter storm of 2014 brought dangerously low temperatures and strong winds from the lower Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic coast, with parts of New England including Boston bracing for as much as 14 inches (36 cm) of snow by Friday morning. \n",
      "“As this winter storm unfolds, bringing heavy snow and high winds to many parts of the state, I strongly urge all New Yorkers to exercise caution, avoid travel and stay indoors,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said. \n",
      "Amid flight cancellations that hit just as many travelers were returning from holiday breaks, officials at Boston’s Logan International Airport warned that takeoffs would likely end at about 8:30 p.m. (0130 GMT) and officials at New York area airports set up cots for potential stranded travelers. \n",
      "The snowfall was expected to intensify after sunset, with the heaviest accumulation coming overnight. Some cities along the storm’s southern edge expect only minimal snowfall. \n",
      "Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie both ordered state offices closed on Friday for non-essential employees, saying they expected the worst to hit between late Thursday and early Friday morning. \n",
      "“The real action is going to get cranked up this evening and during the overnight hours. We’ll have heavy snow, windy conditions, reduced visibilities,” said Kim Buttrick, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Massachusetts. \n",
      "The storm posed the first major challenge to the administration of New York’s new mayor, Bill de Blasio. Problems from digging out from snowstorms have been political havoc for mayors in the United States’ biggest city for decades. \n",
      "After his first emergency management meeting, De Blasio urged New Yorkers to get off the streets as soon as possible and let snow crews do their work. \n",
      "“This is the first of many times I will say please stay indoors. Stay out of your cars. If you don’t need to go out, please don’t go out,” he said. \n",
      "The powerful storm forced about 1,807 U.S. flights to be canceled and about 4,536 delayed, with Chicago’s O’Hare International and Newark’s Liberty International Airport the worst-affected airports, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks air travel. \n",
      "New York’s three major airports were preparing to accommodate stranded travelers whose flights were canceled. \n",
      "“We have a few hundred cots at each of the airports should you decide to become an overnight guest,” said Thomas Bosco, an official with the Port Authority of New York and Jersey, at New York’s LaGuardia Airport. The authority also runs Newark and John F. Kennedy International Airport. \n",
      "One traveler, 23-year-old Ruben Raskin of San Jose, California, who was in the area visiting his girlfriend, worried that his Friday flight out of Logan could be delayed or canceled. \n",
      "“It kind of reminds me why I moved to San Jose after going to college out here,” Raskin said. \n",
      "Conditions in Boston were bad enough by afternoon that the “Frozen Fenway” winter carnival, featuring sledding and college ice-hockey at the baseball stadium where the Red Sox play, was canceled for Thursday and Friday. \n",
      "The weather service said the mass of Arctic air would drop temperatures to levels 20 to 30 degrees below normal, with record lows possible on Friday. \n",
      "“Temperatures are expected to plummet tonight and tomorrow with wind chills dropping as low as 25 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (-32 Celsius),” said Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. “That is a very dangerous set of circumstances.” \n",
      "The low temperature in the contiguous United States on Wednesday was -47 Fahrenheit (-43 Celsius), reached in Van Buren, Maine, and tied in Babbitt and Embarrass, Minnesota, the weather service said. \n",
      "Patrick told non-essential state workers to head home at 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) as did his counterparts in neighboring Connecticut. Both encouraged private-sector employers to consider releasing their staff early. \n",
      "Forecast snowfall varied widely, with Washington expected to see under an inch (2 cm), Philadelphia and New York 4 to 8 inches (10-20 cm), Hartford 6 to 10 inches (15-25 cm) and Boston 8 to 14 inches (20-36 cm). \n",
      "But even before the worst of the storm hit slippery road conditions made driving a hazard in many storm-hit areas. \n",
      "In Cleveland, Ohio, Chris Behm spent an hour trying to reach the vocational training center for developmentally disabled people where he works before calling the commute off and urging his 19 employees to stay home. \n",
      "“It was terrible on all of the roads and there is more weather on its way,” Behm said. “It just wasn’t worth it to open and possibly kill someone.” \n",
      "Officials in Boston and Providence said schools would be closed on Friday, and in other districts throughout the region, parents were bracing for the possibility their children would be home on Friday. \n",
      "“It’s tough with these storms because I end up using days off that I don’t want to take,” said Kristen Carson, who had taken the train into Manhattan from her home in suburban Montclair, New Jersey. “After the holiday, it’s really kind of a pinch.”   (Additional reporting by Victoria Cavaliere, Marina Lopes and Scott DiSavino in New York, Daniel Lovering in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Ian Simpson in Washington, Kim Palmer in Cleveland and Mary Wisniewski in Chicago; Editing by Ken Wills)\n",

      "UK lawmakers criticize govt's stockpiling of Roche drug Tamiflu\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers on Friday criticized government spending of 424 million pounds ($702 million) to stockpile Roche’s medicine Tamiflu, saying doubts about the drug’s effectiveness suggest it may not be money well spent. \n",
      "Parliament’s influential Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said it was “surprised and concerned” to discover that information on methods and results of clinical trials of such prescribed drugs “is routinely withheld”, and said there was a “lack of consensus over how well Tamiflu ... actually works”. \n",
      "“The case for stockpiling antiviral medicines at the current level is based on judgment rather than on evidence of their effectiveness during an influenza pandemic,” said Richard Bacon, a leading member of the committee. \n",
      "He added that as well as spending more than 420 million pounds on stockpiling Tamiflu, an antiviral medicine, the Department of Health was forced to write off 74 million pounds of that as a result of poor record-keeping by the National Health Service. \n",
      "“Before spending money in future to maintain the stockpile the (health) department needs to review what level of coverage is appropriate,” he said. \n",
      "Tamiflu has been approved by regulators worldwide and is stockpiled by many governments in case of a global flu outbreak. Sales of the drug hit close to $3 billion in 2009, due to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, although they have since declined. \n",
      "But some researchers claim there is little evidence Tamiflu works and have lobbied since 2009 for Swiss drugmaker Roche to hand over all its data from clinical trials of the medicine. \n",
      "After a lengthy fight, Roche agreed last year that it would hand over the data to outside researchers at the Cochrane Collaboration, a non-profit group that reviews trial data to assess the value of drugs. \n",
      "The PAC said it was “extremely concerning that there has been a five-year delay and that there continues to be a lack of clarity” over whether medicines regulators and safety authorities had access to full trial results. \n",
      "Beyond the Tamiflu situation, the committee said it was concerned that information on methods and results of clinical trials is routinely and legally withheld. \n",
      "“This longstanding regulatory and cultural failure impacts on all of medicine, and undermines the ability of clinicians, researchers and patients to make informed decisions about which treatment is best,” it said in its report. \n",
      "The PAC report forms part of a wider debate about access to data from clinical trials conducted by the pharmaceutical industry to test the efficacy of and win marketing approval for new drugs. Critics say drugmakers routinely hide or bury trial data which is unfavorable. \n",
      "Tracey Brown, director of a group called Sense About Science, which a year ago launched AllTrials - a campaign fighting for all data from all trials of all prescribed drugs to be made available - said the PAC report “adds to the clamor of voices” calling for more transparency in the drug industry. \n",
      "“There is no excuse for not publishing results, but a huge public benefit to having a complete picture of what was found in trials conducted on treatments currently available to patients,” she said. \n",

      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG has settled a U.S. lawsuit in which shareholders accused it of misrepresenting its ability to handle risks associated with mortgage debt prior to the 2008 financial crisis. \n",
      "The settlement in principle was disclosed in a filing on Thursday by Deutsche Bank’s lawyers in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Terms were not disclosed, and final paperwork is expected within 30 days, the filing said. \n",
      "Shareholders accused Deutsche Bank of misleading them about its risk management and the underwriting on mortgage debt it packaged and sold, as well as being too slow to take write-downs. \n",
      "They said this contributed to an 87 percent drop in the German bank’s share price from May 2007 to Jan. 2009. \n",
      "The settlement came after U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest on Oct. 29 refused to let the case proceed as a class action, citing flaws in the methods and conclusions reached by an expert hired by the shareholders. \n",
      "Denials of class certification can boost litigation costs and make it harder for plaintiffs to obtain large recoveries. \n",

      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Conservative activists opposed to President Barack Obama’s healthcare overhaul started a new assault on the Affordable Care Act as more than 2 million people began new health coverage under the law on Thursday. \n",
      "One group, which is backed by the libertarian billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, launched a $2.5 million television ad campaign that targets three Democratic senators who support the law and could face stiff challenges from Republicans in November elections. \n",
      "The group, Americans for Prosperity, or AFP, spent more than $36 million on the 2012 elections, largely for ads that bashed the law known as Obamacare and Democrats who supported it. \n",
      "The ads by AFP are aimed at North Carolina’s Kay Hagan, Louisiana’s Mary Landrieu and New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen. Their bids for re-election will be crucial to Democrats’ efforts to keep control of the U.S. Senate, where Democrats control 55 of the 100 seats. \n",
      "The 30-second videos represent something of a turn in strategy for conservatives, who have spent much of the past year focused on calling for the repeal of the healthcare law, the most sweeping social program since the 1960s. \n",
      "Now, with more than 2 million people having signed up for Obamacare and more enrolling for coverage every day, AFP and other critics are signaling that in advance of the elections, they will try to cast Democrats as liars who misled Americans about the law. \n",
      "The new ads try to link the senators to Obama and his discredited pledge that all Americans who liked their healthcare plans before Obamacare went into effect could keep those plans. \n",
      "In fact, the minimum coverage standards imposed by the healthcare law meant that hundreds of thousands of people with inexpensive, bare-bones policies had their policies canceled. They will have to buy coverage that in some cases is more expensive. Federal subsidies will help many low-income Americans make that transition. \n",
      "For years, Obama had said that “if you like your current insurance, you keep your current insurance.” But in early November he acknowledged that some would not be able to keep their policies and apologized for understating the law’s impact on those people. \n",
      "His initial statements were dubbed the “Lie of the Year” by the PolitiFact fact-checking website. \n",
      "The ads are the latest anti-Obamacare push by the AFP, which since August has spent nearly $19 million on TV messages targeting Democrats who support the law. It was passed in 2010 to help millions of uninsured and under-insured Americans, but Republicans have opposed the reform as an unwarranted expansion of the federal government and say it is too costly and eliminates healthcare choices for many. \n",
      "In the AFP ad aimed at Hagan, a North Carolina woman whose insurance plan was canceled talks directly to the camera. \n",
      "“Kay Hagan told us, ‘If you like your insurance plan and your doctor, you can keep them.’ That just wasn’t true,” she says. The Shaheen and Landrieu ads feature the senators repeating Obama’s claim. \n",
      "In a statement, Landrieu’s campaign called the AFP ads a “grossly misleading” distortion of her efforts to improve the healthcare law. \n",
      "Hagan’s office said it was “a new year and a new smear from a Koch brothers-backed group that has no accountability to North Carolinians.” \n",
      "AFP president Tim Phillips said the ads would run for up to three weeks. “We believe that repealing Obamacare is going to be a long-term effort, and this is part of that long-term effort,” he said.   (Editing by David Lindsey and Grant McCool)\n",

      "Marchionne's Fiat-Chrysler coup the beginning, not the end\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat’s FIA.MI deal to take full control of Chrysler on better-than-expected terms has cemented CEO Sergio Marchionne’s dealmaking reputation, but he might run out of road to channel that drive into operational success for the business. \n",
      "The toll taken by two years of talks and an accompanying investment freeze has already delayed the Italian carmaker’s recovery, and as Marchionne has said he might retire in 2015, his legacy could depend on how his successor plays the hand. \n",
      "Under the $4.35 billion deal unveiled on New Year’s Day, Fiat will acquire the 41.46 percent of Chrysler it does not already own from the United Auto Workers (UAW) union’s retiree healthcare trust. \n",
      "But Bernstein analyst Max Warburton predicted that Fiat shares, which got a 16 percent boost from the deal on Thursday, would hereafter be kept in check by the scale of the task ahead. \n",
      "“Fiat and Chrysler is still very much a work in progress,” he said. \n",
      "The deal timing and price - below expectations and financed mostly by Chrysler cash rather than by Fiat - impressed even those familiar with Marchionne’s track record. \n",
      "In 2005, soon after joining as CEO, he persuaded General Motors (GM.N) to pay Fiat $2 billion not to exercise an option to sell its auto division to the U.S. carmaker. \n",
      "Four years later he took control of bankrupt Chrysler through an initial 20 percent stake, stepping in after rival Nissan (7201.T) CEO Carlos Ghosn got cold feet over a similar cash-free deal he had negotiated with Chrysler. \n",
      "More recently, Marchionne has pulled off the Italian carmaker’s separation from farm machinery maker Fiat Industrial FI.MI and secured the latter’s merger with CNH after sweetening a buyout offer to minority investors. \n",
      "Those successes reflect Marchionne’s “very tough” negotiating tactics and an aversion to compromise, said Enzo Masini, an official with the FIOM union, which has clashed repeatedly with the Fiat boss over pay and conditions in Italian plants. \n",
      "“He always tries to negotiate from a position of strength,” Masini said. “If he doesn’t feel he has an advantage, a situation where he can pin you against the wall, he won’t open a negotiation.” \n",
      "Across the Atlantic, the UAW union had been seeking $5 billion for the stake held by its healthcare trust, before finally accepting the $4.35 billion - of which just $3.65 billion is to be paid up front. \n",
      "Until Wednesday, many investors were braced for a potentially damaging Chrysler IPO after the union said it would exercise its right to float some of the shares in New York. \n",
      "Fiat-Chrysler had raised the stakes by warning that a flotation could jeopardize the alliance. \n",
      "Averting a share sale without paying the asking price was another classic feat of Marchionne brinkmanship, according to those who know him well. \n",
      "“Marchionne must have convinced them the IPO would have been executed at an even lower price,” said a senior Italian banker who is close to Fiat. “That’s hardball - exactly where his strengths lie.” \n",
      "At stake is the completion of a transatlantic tie-up already five years in the making, which has shielded Fiat from the European slump threatening some of its peers. \n",
      "Getting access to Chrysler’s cash and industrial scale is critical to Marchionne’s expansion plan for the Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands, designed to help Fiat’s idling Italian plants export their way out of trouble. \n",
      "But Marchionne’s determination - some say obstinacy - in holding out for the right price has led to costly delays for Fiat’s investment and recovery plans. \n",
      "And the Italian factories are still waiting as they tick along at just 41 percent of capacity, according to 2013 estimates from IHS Automotive. \n",
      "The Fiat brand’s ageing models have seen their Western European market share tumble from 6.7 percent in 2007 to 4.5 percent in the first 11 months of last year, a loss of ground that may prove hard to recover. \n",
      "While completing the Chrysler buyout may be his last big stunt for Fiat and its controlling Agnelli family, it could well be his successor who has to navigate the complex realities of a cross-cultural car merger, which have proven insurmountable for many other pairings. \n",
      "While the CEO has said only that his replacement will be drawn from Fiat-Chrysler’s 20-member executive council, Fiat No.2 Alfredo Altavilla is often cited as favorite. \n",
      "Fiat maintains that product plans were never entirely frozen pending the buyout agreement, and development work has continued on shared vehicle architectures. \n",
      "“Engineers haven’t been sitting around waiting for the deal,” a company spokesman said. \n",
      "“What we haven’t been doing is making final investment decisions in Europe to industrialize products,” he said. “But you can do that very quickly - within about a year.” \n",

      "Colorado ski resorts wary of marijuana tourists; others chase them\n",
      "\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "DENVER, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Colorado ski resorts and the state Tourism Office have chosen not to embrace out-of-state visitors who have come to buy legalized cannabis, creating an opportunity for a handful of small firms that are catering to marijuana tourists. \n",
      "When legalized marijuana became available for sale with the New Year, out-of-state tourists joined Coloradans in lining up at authorized retailers, despite the federal ban on the substance. \n",
      "Colorado, under a 2012 voter-approved referendum, allowed the world’s first state-licensed marijuana retailers to open for business on New Year’s Day and legally sell pot for recreational use. At a number of the roughly three dozen former medical marijuana dispensaries cleared by state regulators to sell the drug, lines of customers formed outside the door. \n",
      "An estimated $1 million in pot sales took place in Colorado on New Year’s Day, said Betty Aldworth, deputy director of National Cannabis Industry Association. \n",
      "Despite this potential customer base, the state’s world-renowned ski resorts remain wary. \n",
      "“There has been a law on the books since the 1970s in Colorado that makes it illegal to ski, board or even get on a ski lift if under the influence,” said Jennifer Rudolph, spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA, an industry trade group that counts most of Colorado’s 26 ski resorts as members. \n",
      "Like the ski resorts, state tourism officials are also keeping a distance. \n",
      "The Colorado Tourism Office “has no plans to use the legalization to promote the state,” it said in a statement. \n",
      "Moreover, it was impossible to forecast how the law may impact tourism, which generated an estimated $16.7 billion in direct travel spending in 2012, the office said. \n",
      "Whatever the size of the market, companies such as Colorado Green Tours want a piece of it. \n",
      "The firm bills itself as a “full-service cannabis friendly” travel agency and has organized ski vacation trips, said Peter Johnson, the company’s founder. The company encourages use of the drug after skiing, not before, he said. \n",
      "“Colorado is obviously well known for world-class skiing,” Johnson said. “Now with cannabis being legal, that’s kind of a fashionable ski accessory if you will.” \n",
      "Matt Brown, co-founder of the Colorado-based firm My 420 Tours, said his company has more than 4,000 people on the waiting list for upcoming tours, which he compared to a jaunt through California’s Napa Valley wine country. \n",
      "“We’re that friend who lives in Colorado who can help introduce you and really show you things that just don’t exist outside of our state,” Brown said. \n",
      "At legal marijuana stores in the Denver area on Wednesday, a number of customers said they came from other states, including Virginia, Ohio and Illinois. \n",
      "Massachusetts visitor Nicole, 24, a legal assistant who declined to give her last name, said in a phone interview on Thursday she and her boyfriend planned a trip to Colorado a month in advance to buy marijuana, and they purchased a gram of the strain “sour diesel.” \n",
      "“We wanted to be part of this,” she said. “It was largely symbolic.” \n",
      "Possession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year under a state constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2012. \n",
      "The law has presented new challenges for law enforcement officials, who are aware legalization could bring marijuana tourists to the state’s ski slopes. \n",
      "San Miguel County Sheriff Bill Masters, whose county includes the Telluride Ski Resort, said enforcing laws about no  public consumption of marijuana would be difficult for so-called infused pot products that are edible and mind-altering. \n",
      "“Is seeing people passing around a lollipop probable cause to take some enforcement action? Probably not,” he said. \n",
      "Denver police and the Colorado State Patrol reported a smooth first day of legalized pot sales in the state. \n",
      "Colorado has acted faster to authorize sales than Washington state, whose voters legalized marijuana at the same time as Colorado in 2012. Washington is scheduled to open its first retail establishments later this year. \n",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice announced in August it would not seek to interfere with the two states’ efforts to regulate and tax marijuana sales, and instead would focus on such areas as restricting the flow of the drug across state lines and keeping it away from minors.

      "Of course the New York Times editorial page wants clemency or, at the very least, a generous plea bargain for National Security Agency contractor turned super-leaker Edward Snowden! The news pages of the New York Times have directly benefited from top-secret leaks from Snowden to break stories since last August, when the paper acquired a cache of his NSA material from the Guardian. (The Guardian published its own \"pardon for Snowden\" editorial today.) In urging leniency for Snowden, the Times editorial page is urging leniency for a specific news-pages source, which the editorial doesn't directly state. If that doesn't define enlightened self-interest, nothing does. \n",
      "The Times editorial page operates independently from the Times news operation, so I'm not suggesting that Executive Editor Jill Abramson instructed Editorial Page Editor Andrew Rosenthal what to write. But on this score, she probably didn't even have to stifle the urge. For the last decade, the news side has been breaking stories about warrantless surveillance by the NSA, a secret bank-data surveillance program, and, via WikiLeaks, the war logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and the U.S. diplomatic cables. The editorial page has lectured the government on its overreach and incompetence in the security realm. Abramson and Rosenthal, who report to the same publisher, obviously harmonize on this score. Even if they didn't, it's unlikely in the extreme that a Times editorial would ever call for a Times news-side source to be seated in a Judas Cradle as punishment for leaking to the press. \n",
      "Did I say unlikely in the extreme? Allow me to reverse my course. Not every editorial page is buckled to its news pages. Take the Washington Post for example. \n",
      "Last summer, a few days after the Post published its first news stories based on the Snowden files, the paper's editorial page took a hard line on Snowden, surmising on June 11 that \"If there is a scandal here, it may be that a government contractor of Mr. Snowden's status had access to so much highly classified material.\" By July 1, the paper was literally editorializing for the government to do everything possible to plug the leaks and for Snowden to surrender to U.S. authorities. At the same time, the paper's reporters, led by Barton Gellman, were sluicing those very secrets into the Post's news pages and continue to do so. Just before Christmas, Gellman published on the Post's Page One a flattering Q&A with the leaker. The harmony between the editorial and news sides, which I posit as a given at the Times, seems dead at the Post. The anti-Snowden editorials may have softened since the summer, but they still aren't vectoring toward any call for clemency. \n",
      "You could ridicule the Times editorial for wild, wishful thinking had Rick Ledgett, a top NSA official in charge of the Snowden damage-assessment task force, not also entertained the idea of amnesty on 60 Minutes three weeks ago. \"It's worth having a conversation about,\" said Ledgett, who is expected to be the agency's next No. 2 official. \"I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured and my bar for those assurances would be very high.\" Ledgett insisted his statement represented a \"personal view\" -- as if top NSA officials expecting promotions are allowed to share their \"personal views\" about national security on national TV. Was he expressing the agency's powerlessness to contain future leaks of the 1.7 million documents Snowden's now believed to have stolen, and trial ballooning the possibility of a deal, or was he gaming Snowden, as I conjectured at the time? \n",
      "Newspaper editorials, in my view, rarely have any impact on the real world. They exist to lend the oversized egos of publishers and owners a sense of power over politicians, politics, and public policy. But sometimes, just sometimes, an editorial can make a difference by adding velocity to an idea already in motion. By publishing its 1,100-word editorial, the Times fills the clemency cup that a top NSA official lathed into being before a television audience. Any criticism of the Times, for promoting clemency, need also address Ledgett’s very public offer of the same with Snowden. His discussion of amnesty on 60 Minutes was about as subtle as a pick-up line shouted across a singles bar at closing time. \n",
      "I can almost see the words forming on ABC News White House correspondent Jon Karl's lips as he stands to ask a question at President Obama's next news conference: \"Mr. President, the New York Times has editorialized in favor of clemency for Edward Snowden. A top NSA official also publicly explored the possibility of amnesty for Snowden on 60 Minutes. What terms would you propose for a Snowden deal?\" \n",
      "The president will duck. He’ll have to duck. But some sort of Snowden deal is still in play. \n",
      "\"The government knows where to find us if they want to have a productive conversation about resolutions that don’t involve Edward Snowden behind bars,” Snowden legal adviser Ben Wizner told the Post's Gellman last week. \n",
      "The next move belongs to Obama. \n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department should either tighten the procedures that it uses to release market-sensitive data to the media or scrap them altogether and distribute the data directly to the public, a watchdog for the department said on Thursday. \n",
      "The recommendation to tighten the so-called lockup process, specifically the department’s weekly jobless claims figures, was included in an audit released by the Labor Department’s Office of Inspector General. The panel was reviewing the process in an effort to prevent the possibility that some investors could have an unfair competitive advantage in buying and selling stocks, bonds and other trading assets. \n",
      "Under the lockup procedure, media outlets are “locked” in a room where they receive embargoed copies of data reports, usually about 30 minutes before the designated release time, and do not have the ability to post stories until the embargo is lifted. \n",
      "The lockups were initiated in the mid-1980s. \n",
      "Government officials are looking to mitigate the crush of high-speed trading systems that have set up systems to retrieve information seconds ahead of the public. High-speed trading has grown significantly in the past decade and is often a key part of some hedge funds’ investment strategies. \n",
      "The lockups allow media outlets to sell data reports to clients, including high-frequency, or algorithmic, trading firms. The firms use computerized trading techniques ahead of individual traders based on the reports. \n",
      "“Algorithmic trading introduces new security variables into a lockup system not originally designed to guard against market-moving distributions that could be caused by the release of government data to certain traders just seconds before the rest of the general public,” the report said. \n",
      "“A few years ago, a few seconds here or there would not have had much of an impact. Today, fractions of a second can equate to millions or even billions of dollars in market movements.” \n",
      "The audit was mainly focused on the Labor Department’s weekly report on jobless claims, but the panel’s recommendations could have a broader impact on how other government agencies consider cracking down on lockups. \n",
      "The lockup process, in which several news outlets participate, covers releases on economic growth, home sales and inflation, among other matters. \n",
      "The report also found that the Employment and Training Administration, which compiles the jobless claim report, had deficiencies in its procedures governing release of the data. \n",
      "The Labor Department said it agrees with some of the issues the audit raised surrounding the efficacy of the lockup process. \n",
      "“We agree with the OIG that it is appropriate to consider ending the weekly claims press lockup,” the Labor Department said in a statement. \n",
      "It said it had already started exploring the value of the press lockup and intends to continue its consideration of how best to disseminate the report to both the public and to news organizations. \n",
      "Many government officials have already considered potential security problems and have tightened procedures this past year to ensure there are not any broken embargoes. \n",
      "Media outlets that take part in the lockups include Bloomberg News, Reuters and the Associated Press. Both Dow Jones and Reuters said they had no comment on the recommendations. Bloomberg and the AP were not immediately available for comment. \n",

      "4 Min Read\n",
      "(adds context) \n",
      "By Niluksi Koswanage \n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Islamic authorities in Malaysia on Thursday seized 321 Bibles from a Christian group because they used the word Allah to refer to God, signalling growing intolerance that may inflame ethnic and religious tension in the Southeast Asian country. \n",
      "The raid comes after a Malaysian court in October ruled that the Arabic word was exclusive to Muslims, most of whom are ethnic Malays, the largest ethnic group in the country alongside sizeable Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities. \n",
      "That ruling overturned a court decision that allowed a Roman Catholic newspaper printed in Malay, the country’s national language, to use Allah. \n",
      "The change has heightened concern that religious authorities, which issue rulings for Muslims and operate alongside civil courts, now have more legal muscle. \n",
      "Analysts say new rulings that affect non-Muslims could be a way of deflecting anger against Prime Minister Najib Razak’s government from poor Malay Muslims over subsidy cuts likely to force up electricity, petrol and sugar prices. \n",
      "On Thursday, the top Islamic authority in the richest and most populous state of Selangor seized the Malay-language Bibles from the Bible Society. The society said authority officials escorted two of its officials to a police station to make statements after which they were released on bail. \n",

      "Heavy snow, dangerous cold snarl travel in northeastern U.S.\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - The governors of New York and New Jersey declared a state of emergency and urged residents to stay indoors as a major storm hit the northeastern United States on Thursday, bringing heavy snow and delaying or canceling thousands of flights. \n",
      "The first major winter storm of 2014 brought dangerously low temperatures and strong winds from the lower Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic coast, with parts of New England including Boston bracing for as much as 14 inches of snow by Friday morning. \n",
      "“As this winter storm unfolds, bringing heavy snow and high winds to many parts of the state, I strongly urge all New Yorkers to exercise caution, avoid travel and stay indoors,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said. \n",
      "Amid flight cancellations that hit just as many travelers were returning from holiday breaks, officials at Boston’s Logan International Airport warned that takeoffs would likely end at about 8:30 p.m. (0130 GMT) and officials at New York area airports set up cots for potential stranded travelers. \n",
      "The snowfall was expected to intensify after sunset, with the heaviest accumulation coming overnight. Some cities along the storm’s southern edge expect only minimal snowfall. \n",
      "Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie both ordered state offices closed on Friday for non-essential employees, saying they expected the worst to hit between late Thursday and early Friday morning. \n",
      "“The real action is going to get cranked up this evening and during the overnight hours. We’ll have heavy snow, windy conditions, reduced visibilities,” said Kim Buttrick, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Massachusetts. \n",
      "The storm posed the first major challenge to the administration of New York’s new mayor, Bill de Blasio. Problems from digging out from snowstorms have been political havoc for mayors in the United States’ biggest city for decades. \n",
      "After his first emergency management meeting, De Blasio urged New Yorkers to get off the streets as soon as possible and let snow crews do their work. \n",
      "“This is the first of many times I will say please stay indoors. Stay out of your cars. If you don’t need to go out, please don’t go out,” he said. \n",
      "The powerful storm forced about 1,807 U.S. flights to be canceled and about 4,536 delayed, with Chicago’s O’Hare International and Newark’s Liberty International Airport the worst-affected airports, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks air travel. \n",
      "New York’s three major airports were preparing to accommodate stranded travelers whose flights were canceled. \n",
      "“We have a few hundred cots at each of the airports should you decide to become an overnight guest,” said Thomas Bosco, an official with the Port Authority of New York and Jersey, at New York’s LaGuardia Airport. The authority also runs Newark and John F. Kennedy International Airport. \n",
      "One traveler, 23-year-old Ruben Raskin of San Jose, California, who was in the area visiting his girlfriend, worried that his Friday flight out of Logan could be delayed or canceled. \n",
      "“It kind of reminds me why I moved to San Jose after going to college out here,” Raskin said. \n",
      "Conditions in Boston were bad enough by afternoon that the “Frozen Fenway” winter carnival, featuring sledding and college ice-hockey at the baseball stadium where the Red Sox play, was canceled for Thursday and Friday. \n",
      "The weather service said the mass of Arctic air would drop temperatures to levels 20 to 30 degrees below normal, with record lows possible on Friday. \n",
      "“Temperatures are expected to plummet tonight and tomorrow with wind chills dropping as low as 25 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (-32 Celsius),” said Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. “That is a very dangerous set of circumstances.” \n",
      "The low temperature in the contiguous United States on Wednesday was -47 Fahrenheit (-43 Celsius), reached in Van Buren, Maine, and tied in Babbitt and Embarrass, Minnesota, the weather service said. \n",
      "Patrick told non-essential state workers to head home at 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) as did his counterparts in neighboring Connecticut. Both encouraged private-sector employers to consider releasing their staff early. \n",
      "Forecast snowfall varied widely, with Washington expected to see under an inch, Philadelphia and New York 4 to 8 inches, Hartford 6 to 10 inches and Boston 8 to 14 inches. \n",
      "But even before the worst of the storm hit slippery road conditions made driving a hazard in many storm-hit areas. \n",
      "In Cleveland, Ohio, Chris Behm spent an hour trying to reach the vocational training center for developmentally disabled people where he works before calling the commute off and urging his 19 employees to stay home. \n",
      "“It was terrible on all of the roads and there is more weather on its way,” Behm said. “It just wasn’t worth it to open and possibly kill someone.” \n",
      "Officials in Boston and Providence said schools would be closed on Friday, and in other districts throughout the region, parents were bracing for the possibility their children would be home on Friday. \n",
      "“It’s tough with these storms because I end up using days off that I don’t want to take,” said Kristen Carson, who had taken the train into Manhattan from her home in suburban Montclair, New Jersey. “After the holiday, it’s really kind of a pinch.” \n",

      "KINSHASA (Reuters) - The colonel in charge of military operations against rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo was killed on Thursday in an ambush along with three other soldiers, government spokesman Lambert Mende said. \n",
      "Colonel Mamadou Ndala, who helped to secure the military defeat of the M23 rebel group in November, died of his injuries after a rocket attack on his vehicle near the village of Mazizi in North Kivu province, Mende said. \n",
      "His killing indicated the challenge facing the Congolese government and a 21,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission in its efforts to pacify dozens of armed groups operating in the east of the vast central African nation. \n",
      "“Colonel Mamadou Ndala has just passed away,” Mende told Reuters by telephone, adding that the three other soldiers in the vehicle were also dead. “We have not yet identified the attackers.” \n",
      "Ndala was in charge of tackling the ADF-NALU rebels, a Ugandan group which has stepped up its attacks in eastern Congo this year and has been identified by a U.N. peacekeeping mission as one of the main obstacles to peace in the mineral-rich region. \n",
      "ADF-NALU has been blamed for a spate of recent attacks and kidnappings around the town of Beni in North Kivu, including the deaths of at least 60 civilians in two attacks last month. \n",

      "* Asian shares shaky after falls on Wall St, European bourses \n",
      "* Euro runs into profit-taking, while yen gets a lift \n",
      "* Oil prices fall sharply on supply outlook \n",
      "By Wayne Cole \n",
      "SYDNEY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Asian markets were on the defensive on Friday after a sudden  reversal in some very popular, and thus crowded, trades sparked a bout of global risk aversion. \n",
      "The net result was a pullback in the euro, sterling, and stocks and a bounce for the yen, gold and bonds. Oil prices also fell sharply, though for purely idiosyncratic reasons. \n",
      "The various moves seemed to pay no regard to the news flow, which was generally upbeat with global manufacturing ending 2013 on a strong note as the United States, Japan and Germany all saw demand pick up, although there was some moderation in China. \n",
      "There is little in the way of fresh data due on Friday, though a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will bear watching given the markets’ sensitivity to anything to do with tapering. \n",
      "On Wall Street, the Dow fell 0.82 percent on Thursday and the S&P; 500 lost 0.89 percent. MSCI’s 45-country share index slipped 1 percent, while U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures fell 2.1 percent. \n",
      "Early Friday, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 percent, with the Australian market off 0.5 percent. \n",
      "Anxious eyes were fixed on Thailand after the stock market sank over 5 percent on Thursday amid deepening political uncertainty. The Thai currency also took a bath, hitting its lowest since early 2010 at 32.95 per dollar. \n",
      "Shares in South Korea also made a shaky start to the year, though there the problem was one of a strong won and a weak yen undermining the competitiveness of the country’s huge export companies. \n",
      "Samsung Electronics Co Ltd alone fell more than 5 percent on Thursday to its lowest in over four months. \n",
      "In currencies, the euro took a spill as speculators booked profits on long positions after a strong 2013. The single currency had dropped back a full cent to $1.3664 and briefly touched a two-week low of $1.3628. \n",
      "The same forces gripped sterling, another strong performer in recent months. The pound peeled away to $1.6451 from a 28-month peak of $1.6605. \n",
      "That in turn lifted the U.S. dollar index, a gauge of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, by the most in five months. Early Friday, the index was up at 80.580  from a low of 80.083 the day before. \n",
      "Going the other way, the yen enjoyed a short-covering bounce. Borrowing in yen to buy higher yielding assets has been a vastly popular trade, leaving the market vulnerable to sudden, if usually brief, reversals. \n",
      "In this case the dollar came off to 104.79 yen after being as high as 105.44, its strongest level since October 2008. Likewise, the euro retreated to 143.26 yen from a peak of 145.12 on Thursday. \n",
      "The short-covering theme extended to U.S. Treasury debt, which has been under pressure for pretty much all of the past  two months. Yields on the 10-year note dipped to 2.99 percent from a top of 3.04 percent, which had been the highest sine mid-2011. \n",
      "Gold was another beaten-down asset to get a reprieve. The metal swung up to $1,224.00 having been as low as $1,183.80 early in the week. \n",
      "Three-month copper touched its highest level in seven months encouraged by the improving background for global manufacturing. \n",
      "Oil prices went the other way as Libya prepared to restart a major oilfield and on speculation of a sharp rise in crude stockpiles in the United States. \n",
      "Brent crude lost $2.98 on Thursday to $107.82 a barrel. U.S. crude was at $95.45 having shed almost $5 on Thursday.\n",

      "COLOMBO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee ended slightly weaker on Thursday on importer dollar demand, despite dollar-buying by a state-run bank to prevent appreciation in the currency due to inflows, dealers said. \n",
      "Dealers also said the bond market was active after the  central bank slashed the standing lending facility rate or reverse repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 8.00 percent before the market opened on Thursday, in a move to reduce commercial banks’ interest rate spreads. \n",
      "The spot rupee closed at 130.70/75 per dollar weaker from Wednesday’s close of 130.65/75. \n",
      "“Importer dollar demand was seen in the morning and we have seen some inflows later in the day,” a currency dealer said on condition of anonymity. \n",
      "Dealers also said one of the two state banks, through which the central bank usually direct the market, was seen buying dollars to prevent the rupee appreciation. \n",
      "Revealing the 2014 financial and monetary policies, Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said the monetary authority expects the rupee currency to strengthen in the medium term due to improvement in capital inflows. \n",
      "“The central bank’s direct intervention in foreign exchange market will be at minimal level and only in the event there are signs of excessive fluctuation, the bank will absorb or supply foreign exchange as and when required,” Cabraal said. \n",
      "Dealers expect the currency to appreciate in the first quarter of 2014 due to a possible dollar bond inflow, before falling due to lower interest rates pressurising the exchange rate amid a pick-up in importer dollar demand. \n",
      "The local currency has gained about 3.4 percent since it hit a record low of 135.20 on Aug. 28. It lost 2.5 percent in 2013 following a 10.7 percent depreciation in 2012.   (Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Anand Basu)\n",

      "* Making a success of complex deal could fall to successor \n",
      "By Laurence Frost \n",
      "PARIS, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Fiat’s deal to take full control of Chrysler on better-than-expected terms has cemented CEO Sergio Marchionne’s dealmaking reputation, but he might run out of road to channel that drive into operational success for the business. \n",
      "The toll taken by two years of talks and an accompanying investment freeze has already delayed the Italian carmaker’s recovery, and as Marchionne has said he might retire in 2015, his legacy could depend on how his successor plays the hand. \n",
      "Under the $4.35 billion deal unveiled on New Year’s Day, Fiat will acquire the 41.46 percent of Chrysler it does not already own from the United Auto Workers (UAW) union’s retiree healthcare trust. \n",
      "But Bernstein analyst Max Warburton predicted that Fiat shares, which got a 16 percent boost from the deal on Thursday, would hereafter be kept in check by the scale of the task ahead. \n",
      "“Fiat and Chrysler is still very much a work in progress,” he said. \n",
      "The deal timing and price - below expectations and financed mostly by Chrysler cash rather than by Fiat - impressed even those familiar with Marchionne’s track record. \n",
      "In 2005, soon after joining as CEO, he persuaded General Motors to pay Fiat $2 billion not to exercise an option to sell its auto division to the U.S. carmaker. \n",
      "Four years later he took control of bankrupt Chrysler through an initial 20 percent stake, stepping in after rival Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn got cold feet over a similar cash-free deal he had negotiated with Chrysler. \n",
      "More recently, Marchionne has pulled off the Italian carmaker’s separation from farm machinery maker Fiat Industrial  and secured the latter’s merger with CNH after sweetening a buyout offer to minority investors. \n",
      "Those successes reflect Marchionne’s “very tough” negotiating tactics and an aversion to compromise, said Enzo Masini, an official with the FIOM union, which has clashed repeatedly with the Fiat boss over pay and conditions in Italian plants. \n",
      "“He always tries to negotiate from a position of strength,” Masini said. “If he doesn’t feel he has an advantage, a situation where he can pin you against the wall, he won’t open a negotiation.” \n",
      "Across the Atlantic, the UAW union had been seeking $5 billion for the stake held by its healthcare trust, before finally accepting the $4.35 billion - of which just $3.65 billion is to be paid up front. \n",
      "Until Wednesday, many investors were braced for a potentially damaging Chrysler IPO after the union said it would exercise its right to float some of the shares in New York. \n",
      "Fiat-Chrysler had raised the stakes by warning that a flotation could jeopardise the alliance. \n",
      "Averting a share sale without paying the asking price was another classic feat of Marchionne brinkmanship, according to those who know him well. \n",
      "“Marchionne must have convinced them the IPO would have been executed at an even lower price,” said a senior Italian banker who is close to Fiat. “That’s hardball - exactly where his strengths lie.” \n",
      "At stake is the completion of a transatlantic tie-up already five years in the making, which has shielded Fiat from the European slump threatening some of its peers. \n",
      "Getting access to Chrysler’s cash and industrial scale is critical to Marchionne’s expansion plan for the Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands, designed to help Fiat’s idling Italian plants export their way out of trouble. \n",
      "But Marchionne’s determination - some say obstinacy - in holding out for the right price has led to costly delays for Fiat’s investment and recovery plans. \n",
      "And the Italian factories are still waiting as they tick along at just 41 percent of capacity, according to 2013 estimates from IHS Automotive. \n",
      "The Fiat brand’s ageing models have seen their Western European market share tumble from 6.7 percent in 2007 to 4.5 percent in the first 11 months of last year, a loss of ground that may prove hard to recover. \n",
      "While completing the Chrysler buyout may be his last big stunt for Fiat and its controlling Agnelli family, it could well be his successor who has to navigate the complex realities of a cross-cultural car merger, which have proven insurmountable for many other pairings. \n",
      "While the CEO has said only that his replacement will be drawn from Fiat-Chrysler’s 20-member executive council, Fiat No.2 Alfredo Altavilla is often cited as favourite. \n",
      "Fiat maintains that product plans were never entirely frozen pending the buyout agreement, and development work has continued on shared vehicle architectures. \n",
      "“Engineers haven’t been sitting around waiting for the deal,” a company spokesman said. \n",
      "“What we haven’t been doing is making final investment decisions in Europe to industrialise products,” he said. “But you can do that very quickly - within about a year.”\n",

      "8 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - Happy New Year! For the first time since 2008, we investors, economists and businesspeople say these words without irony. While last year was statistically disappointing, with global growth slowing slightly from 2012 and apparently belying the optimism expressed here last January, the verdict of financial markets and business sentiment has been much more consistent with my predictions. Despite the apparent slowdown, stock markets enjoyed their best performance since the 1990s, long-term interest rates soared and consumer confidence all over the world ended 2013 much higher than it started. This apparent paradox is easily explained: the statistical weakness of 2013 was due entirely to a very weak period last winter, connected with the U.S. presidential election and leadership transition in China. By the second quarter, growth had revived in the U.S. and China and accelerated strongly in Britain and Japan. \n",
      "That conventional wisdom last January was far too pessimistic about the economic outlook is evidenced by the subsequent behavior of financial markets, where equities outperformed bonds by the biggest annual margin on record. But today almost everyone is optimistic. So what unexpected developments could surprise financial markets and business sentiment in 2014? Below are five personal guesses - some possibly far-fetched and others are seemingly obvious, but none yet fully reflected in market prices: \n",
      "1. Four is the new two. \n",
      "I think the U.S. economy will grow by about 4 percent, much faster than the 2.5 to 3 percent predicted by the IMF and mainstream economic forecasts. My reasoning is simple. In the last reported quarter, the U.S. economy was already growing by 4.1 percent and the private sector by 4.9 percent. With U.S. budget battles now over and short-term interest rates firmly anchored at zero, there is no reason to expect a slowdown. If the U.S. accelerates to around 4 percent, so will global growth and 4 percent will replace 2 percent as the growth rate assumed in business and financial planning. Global inflation expectations will also rise to around 3 percent, raising the benchmark for global growth in nominal terms to around 7 percent, very similar to the 10 years before the 2008 financial crisis. In other words, the “new normal” of global stagnation widely predicted after the crisis will turn out to be not very different from the old normal. \n",
      "2. The big financial trends of 2013 still have a long way to go. \n",
      "While the gains of over 20 percent in major stock markets may not be repeated this year, equity prices in most of the world should continue rising - and bond prices continue falling. Stock market optimism seems justified for two reasons. Wall Street has now decisively broken a 13-year trading range and past experience, as described in this column last March, strongly suggests that this breakout signals the start of a bull market in global equities that will last for many years. Shifting from history to financial fundamentals, the 6 or 7 percent nominal growth I expect in the global economy should translate into similar growth in corporate revenues and earnings. That would imply similar gains in equity prices, even without any increase in price-earnings multiples or leveraging up of corporate balance sheets through stock buybacks. Given that equity valuations are still only slightly above long-term average levels and that companies are flush with cash, there should be scope for considerably stronger gains in many stock markets. \n",
      "The biggest problem for stock markets will be higher interest rates, since 10-year yields will rise to at least 3.5 percent as the U.S. economy accelerates. But history shows that stock market prices usually rise alongside rising bond yields during periods of economic recovery, provided short-term rates remain low. And luckily for equity investors, the Federal Reserve will maintain its commitment to zero short-term interest rates however much the economy accelerates, because Fed officials see rapid growth as a natural and welcome development after five years of deep recession. \n",
      "3. The European crisis will metastasize from economics into politics. \n",
      "Unfortunately European central bankers have a very different worldview. They see rapid growth as a portent of inflation and will start hinting at tighter money as soon as economic conditions improve. The conflict between strong growth and easy money has already appeared in Britain. It will become a major political problem in 2014, because the improvement in economic activity depends entirely on a property boom that the Bank of England is trying (unsuccessfully) to deflate. As a result, sterling will continue to strengthen, central bank independence will come under pressure and the British economy will become ever more unbalanced, generating the world’s biggest trade deficit relative to GDP. In the euro zone, by contrast, economic conditions will remain feeble at least until the summer, when a shift towards more expansionary monetary and fiscal policies will be triggered by panic in Germany about the big victories for fringe nationalist and neo-fascist parties in May’s European elections. As a result, the euro will weaken and the southern European economies will finally start to recover, but not until the second half of the year. \n",
      "4. Japan will shoot itself in the foot - again. \n",
      "Japan is the major economy most likely to disappoint expectations in 2014, making a mockery of the optimism expressed here last year about Abenomics. The consumption tax increase in April will produce a fiscal tightening worth roughly 2 percent of GDP, after allowing for some feeble offsetting measures. As a result, Japan will probably sink back into recession by the second quarter and the stock market will fall sharply, even though the Bank of Japan will try to ramp up its monetary stimulus and the yen will probably weaken even more. \n",
      "5. Emerging markets will make a comeback - perhaps in unlikely places. \n",
      "With the U.S. accelerating to 4 percent and China growing steadily in the 7 to 8 percent range, emerging markets will come into their own as investors realize that most of these economies have more to gain from robust economic conditions and stronger commodity prices than they have to lose from slightly higher interest rates. There will, of course, be exceptions. Financial problems may intensify in countries with large trade deficits or political mismanagement, such as Turkey and perhaps Brazil. On the other hand, two major economies now treated as pariahs could do surprisingly well. In Russia, the recent release of Mikhail Khodorkovsky could signal a newfound respect for private property rights. And a nuclear deal with Iran could bring this potentially dynamic economy back into the civilized world, as well as transforming Middle East geopolitics. But at this point, I am probably getting too optimistic even for a New Year pipe dream. \n",

      "Let’s make candidates pledge not to use bots\n",
      "7 Min Read\n",
      "Bots — chunks of computer code that generate messages and replicate themselves — have been infecting political discourse around the world. They have been spotted try to influence elections in the United Kingdom, Mexico and just recently, South Korea. Politicians there have been using bots to torment their opponents, muddle political conversations, and misdirect debate. We need political leaders to pledge not to use them. \n",
      "In Canada’s last election, one-fifth of the Twitter followers of the country’s leading political figures were bots. Even Mitt Romney had a bot problem, though it’s not clear whether exaggerating the number of Twitter followers he had was a deliberate strategy or an attempt by outsiders to make him look bad. We know that authoritarian governments in Azerbaijan, Russia, and Venezuela use bots. The governments of Bahrain, Syria and Iran have used bots as part of their counter-insurgency strategies. The Chinese government uses bots to shape public opinion around the world and at home, especially on sensitive topics like the status of Tibet. \n",
      "Bots are becoming more and more prevalent. And social media is becoming a more and more important source of political news and information, especially for young people, and especially for people living in countries where the main journalistic outlets are deficient. Sophisticated technology users can sometimes spot a bot, but the best bots can be quite successful at poisoning a political conversation. Would political campaign managers in a democracy like the United States actually use them? \n",
      "These days, campaign managers consider interfering with a rival’s contact system an aggressive campaign strategy. That’s because one of the most statistically significant predictors of voter turnout these days is a successful phone contact from a party supporter the night before the election. This is what has driven up invasive robo-calls. In 2006, automated calling banks reached two-thirds of voters and by 2008 robo-calls were the favored outreach tool for both Democrats and Republicans. Incapacitating your opponents’ information infrastructure in the hours before an election has become part of the game, though there have been few criminal convictions of party officials caught working with hackers to attack call centers, political websites and campaign headquarters. Republican National Committee official James Tobin was sentenced to 10 months in prison for hiring hackers to attack Democrat phone banks on Election Day in 2002. But we do know that partisans regularly launch denial of service attacks – Obamacare websites have been recent targets. If an aggressive move with technology provides some competitive advantage, some campaign manager will try it. \n",
      "The question is not whether Republicans and Democrats will start using bots on each other — and us — but when. Unleashed at a strategic moment in the campaign cycle, or let loose by a lobbyist targeting key districts at a sensitive moment for a piece of legislation, bots could have immense implications for a political outcome. Bots are a kind of nuclear option for political conversation. They might influence popular opinion, but they are certainly bad for the public sphere. \n",
      "For countries that hold elections, bots have become a serious, internal new threat to democracy. Most of the other democracies where bots have been used have tight spending restrictions on political campaigns and well-enunciated spending laws. In the United States, political campaigning is an aggressive, big money game, where even candidates in down ballot races may think that manipulating public opinion with social media is a cost-effective campaign strategy. \n",
      "This is why we need an immediate “No First Use” pledge. Of course, a “No Use” pledge from campaign officials would be best. Realistically, any candidate who thinks his or her opponents have launched Twitter and Facebook bots is going to retaliate quickly. And the PACs, lobbyists, and donors affiliated with candidates will be tempted to release bots of their own. It has been tough for party leaders to ensure the good behavior of all their staff. Still, a clear signal from the top that bots aren’t acceptable is needed now, before we get into the 2014 campaign season. \n",
      "Political campaigning is not a sport for the weak. And neither Twitter nor Facebook are the best place for complex political conversations. But citizens do use social media to share political news, humor, and information with their networks of family and friends. And it is possible to have meaningful political exchanges over social media, especially when elections are on the horizon. So please, political candidates everywhere, don’t pollute the public sphere with bots. \n",

      "The Philadelphia 76ers went nearly two months without a road win but all of a sudden have a chance at three straight when they continue a six-game trip at the Sacramento Kings on Thursday. The 76ers beat the Washington Wizards on the road Nov. 1 and dropped their next 13 outside Philadelphia before knocking off the Los Angeles Lakers and the Denver Nuggets this week. The Kings are coming off an impressive victory at Houston and have won three of five. \n",
      "The 76ers held both the Lakers and the Nuggets under 105 - six below their NBA-worst average - and continue to get strong play from Thaddeus Young, who picked up his third double-double in four games on Wednesday. Philadelphia put up 44 points in the second quarter of the 114-102 victory at Denver and is capable of scoring in bunches. The Kings are just one spot ahead of the 76ers in points allowed, surrendering an average of 104, but are making up for it at the other end as Rudy Gay continues to gel with DeMarcus Cousins and Isaiah Thomas. \n",
      "TV: 10 p.m. ET, 10 p.m. ET, TCN (Philadelphia), CSN California (Sacramento) \n",
      "ABOUT THE 76ERS (10-21): Young had a string of four straight 25-point outings come to an end with 17 against the Nuggets but is averaging 25.4 points and nine rebounds over the last five contests and he has not scored fewer than 14 points since Dec. 7. Philadelphia is by far the worst team in the NBA in scoring defense and surrendered 115.5 in dropping the first two games of its road trip but held both Los Angeles (36.9) and Denver (39.6) under 40 percent from the field. The 76ers’ defense was especially strong beyond the arc, where the Lakers and Nuggets combined to go 17-for-62. \n",
      "ABOUT THE KINGS (10-20): Sacramento has been looking for improvement out of its core and felt like it found it with the 110-106 victory over the Rockets, which followed a setback at San Antonio. “It just shows our improvement, and the crazy thing is we have so much more to improve on,” Cousins said. “…We were just saying we were in that situation 48 hours ago, so for us to come back and improve in just that one game, it shows a lot.” The Kings last home game was a 108-103 overtime triumph over the Miami Heat on Friday, and they are averaging 105.4 points over the last five games. \n",
      "1. The 76ers have taken three straight in the series, including a 117-103 triumph at Sacramento on Mar. 24. \n",
      "2. Cousins has posted five straight double-doubles and 10 in his last 12 games. \n",
      "3. Philadelphia PG Michael Carter-Williams is averaging 18 points and 7.8 assists in five games since returning from a knee infection. \n",

      "UPDATE 2-Rise in Russian oil output supports overstretched budget\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "* Oil output in 2013 up almost 1.4 pct at 10.51 mln bpd \n",
      "* Budget tested by high social spending, Olympics \n",
      "* China set to become largest customer \n",
      "By Vladimir Soldatkin \n",
      "MOSCOW, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Russia retained the title of the world’s top oil producer with 2013 output reaching a post-Soviet high as rising exports to China and strong prices allow the Kremlin to maintain record spending from an overstretched budget. \n",
      "Energy has been the engine of Russia’s growth during more than a decade of leadership by President Vladimir Putin, with oil and gas accounting for more than half of budget revenues. \n",
      "But the government, which has amassed some of the world’s largest foreign exchange reserves of over $500 billion, has been increasingly overstretching its finances due to social spending promised by Putin before the 2012 election as well as a swelling $50 billion budget for the 2014 Winter Olympics. \n",
      "Keeping oil output high has therefore been a priority for the government. The rise has defied predictions that new fields in East Siberia and the Arctic will be unable to compensate for declines from ageing oilfields in West Siberia. \n",
      "“Enough investment is being made to slow declines in West Siberia and increase production in East Siberia in order to make for small net production increases,” analysts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) told Reuters on Thursday. \n",
      "The IEA, the West’s energy watchdog, expects Russian production to remain flat at around 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of the decade, and then decrease to about 9.5 million bpd by 2035. \n",
      "The IEA says that key to maintaining Russian production levels would be the Kremlin’s ability to extract hard-to-recover oil, emulating U.S. successes, and to encourage more production in remote Arctic and East Siberia regions. \n",
      "Despite record output, Russia’s budget funding gap could reach some $300 billion between 2017 and 2020 should spending remain high and oil prices drop, according to the Finance Ministry’s budget strategy to 2030. \n",
      "That is three times the current value of the Reserve Fund, a rainy-day collection of windfall energy revenues. \n",
      "Last year’s budget was estimated to balance at an oil price of $110 per barrel and this year’s at some $115 a barrel, Alfa Bank chief economist Natalia Orlova said. \n",
      "That is dangerously close to or even higher than current prices for benchmark Brent crude, which stood at an average of below $110 in 2013 and are expected to remain under downward pressure in years to come due to a U.S. shale oil boom and a possible rise in exports from Iran. \n",
      "Russian energy ministry data showed on Thursday that the country’s oil output rose to a post-Soviet high of 10.51 million bpd in 2013, up almost 1.4 percent from 2012. \n",
      "December’s monthly production averaged 10.63 million bpd, also a post-Soviet high. \n",
      "Russian output likely stayed above that of Saudi Arabia, which kept production steady at around 9.7 million bpd in October and November. Saudi data for December is not yet available. \n",
      "Almost all large Russian oil firms increased output in 2013 as they boosted drilling, including Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil producer and top non-state oil company, which had logged declines in the previous three years. \n",
      "State-controlled Rosneft, the world’s top listed oil producer, posted a dramatic jump in output to 3.1 million bpd thanks to the acquisition of rival TNK-BP and production increases in East Siberia. \n",
      "The year was also marked by a further diversion of Russian oil to China, away from saturated European markets, as     eastbound flows rose by almost a fifth to 740,000 bpd. \n",
      "As Russia agreed to increase deliveries further to China in coming years, the Asian giant will likely replace Germany as the largest customer for Russian pipeline oil in the first quarter of 2014. \n",
      "Despite the jump in eastbound flows, Russian oil exports outside the former Soviet Union fell by around 2.5 percent to 4.53 million bpd as Russia ramped up oil refining. \n",
      "Domestic refining rose by 180,000 bpd, reflecting the country’s $55 billion programme launched in 2011 to modernise its refineries and encourage exports of high-quality oil products. \n",
      "Gazprom, the world’s top gas producer, saw its output slip to 1.30 billion cubic metres (bcm) per day from 1.31 bcm per day in 2012 although its exports to Europe jumped 16 percent to a record 161.5 billion cubic metres.\n",

      "UPDATE 1-US considers flammability risk of Bakken crude after accidents\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "By Patrick Rucker \n",
      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Crude oil produced in North Dakota may be more flammable and prone to explosions than earlier thought, U.S. officials said on Thursday as they examine whether gas trapped in crude-by-rail shipments could explain a spate of fiery accidents. \n",
      "In the latest mishap involving fuel produced in an oil patch known as the Bakken, several tank cars exploded after a collision on a desolate stretch of North Dakota track on Monday. \n",
      "In that case, as with several other accidents in recent months, tank cars exploded with a force that surprised investigators. \n",
      "The incidents “indicate that the type of crude being transported from the Bakken region may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil,” the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration said on Thursday. \n",
      "Officials are examining whether Bakken crude is unduly corrosive, more sulfurous or loaded with explosive gas as it moves on the tracks from oil fields to distant refineries. \n",
      "On Thursday, Bakken producers were warned to “sufficiently degasify” crude oil being loaded onto tank cars, and officials said they will examine the “dissolved gas content” of crude oil shipments. \n",
      "Packing gas onto tank cars meant to carry liquid fuels can push the pressure to dangerous levels and provoke explosions, industry officials have said. \n",
      "“Large amounts of vapor pressure can split the tank, sink the roof and emit (a) flammable gas cloud,” the Canadian Crude Quality Technical Association, an industry-sponsored research group, concluded in March. \n",
      "Bakken producers have recently reported a large amount of corrosion in tank cars and “high vapor pressure causing bubbling crude,” the trade group said. \n",
      "Advances in drilling technology have dramatically spurred oil production in North Dakota in recent years. Over two-thirds of the state’s oil production is currently shipped by rail. \n",
      "Trains carried nearly 700,000 barrels a day of North Dakota oil to market in October, a 67 percent jump from a year earlier, according to the state pipeline authority. \n",
      "Officials are considering new rail safety rules for crude shipments in light of several spectacular accidents in the United States and Canada. \n",
      "In July, a runaway oil train carrying light shale crude oil from the Bakken region derailed and exploded in the center of the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic, killing 47 people.\n",

      "MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Islamist militants in Somalia said on Thursday that they carried out the triple bombing on a Mogadishu hotel that killed at least 11 people. \n",

      "Al Shabaab said it had killed more than a dozen people in Wednesday’s attack. A private ambulance service director said his medics had recovered at least 11 bodies. \n",
      "The assault on the Jazira hotel, one of the securest places in the coastal capital, underscored worries in neighboring countries and beyond that Somalia could slip back into anarchy if recent military gains against rebels are not consolidated. \n",
      "An attack on a Kenyan shopping mall in September in which dozens of people were killed highlighted the militants’ ability to strike beyond Somalia’s borders. \n",
      "Islamist suicide bombers struck the Jazira hotel in September 2012 as President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was giving a news conference just two days after his election by lawmakers. \n",

      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the euro on Thursday as an array of U.S. economic data further supported the stance for the Federal Reserve to gradually scale back its bond-buying stimulus. \n",
      "The euro, the strongest-performing major currency in 2013 but historically a weaker performer at the start of a calendar year, dropped to a two-week low of $1.3634 and last traded 0.8 percent lower at $1.3648. \n",
      "The U.S. dollar hit a high of 105.44 yen, its strongest level versus the Japanese currency since October 2008, before erasing gains to last trade down 0.3 percent at 104.94  yen. \n",
      "Japanese financial markets are closed on Thursday and Friday for the New Year’s break. \n",
      "Volumes were low in late December and prices driven by factors such as euro zone banks repatriating funds to shore up their capital bases before the European Central Bank’s year-end review of their assets, which supported the euro. \n",
      "“Last week the market was mainly determined by position rescaling,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of currency research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. \n",
      "“Today is the first day where fundamentals work out again ... That’s why there is pressure on euro/dollar.” \n",
      "Against the backdrop of a firming jobs market and brightening economic outlook, the Fed in December announced it would reduce its monthly $85 billion bond buying program by $10 billion starting this month. \n",
      "U.S. construction spending rose to its highest level in nearly five years in November as a surge in private construction projects offset a drop in public outlays. \n",
      "The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell for a second week last week, suggesting labor market conditions continue to steadily improve. \n",
      "U.S. manufacturing ended the year on a high note, growing in December at its fastest pace in 11 months, while the rate of job growth was the swiftest since March, an industry report showed on Thursday. \n",
      "While few analysts expect the ECB, which holds a policy meeting next week, to change interest rates in the near future, the Fed is closely monitoring the strength of the U.S. recovery to gauge the pace at which it scales back its bond-buying. \n",
      "“The sensitivity to surprises in data in the euro zone is much lower than the sensitivity to surprises in the data in the U.S.” Leuchtmann said. \n",
      "Germany’s manufacturing PMI for December came in marginally above expectations at 54.3 on Thursday, while the euro zone manufacturing PMI was in line with forecasts at 52.7. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. \n",
      "But it offered little sustained support for the single currency, which was down 1.2 percent against the yen at 143.04  yen. \n",
      "“Over the last 20 years there’s been a relatively strong tendency for the euro to fall and the dollar to rise in January,” said Anders Soderberg, chief technical analyst at SEB in Stockholm. \n",
      "The Australian dollar was down 0.5 percent at $0.8928  after official Chinese data released on Wednesday underscored the view that the world’s second-largest economy lost some momentum in late 2013. China is Australia’s top export market. \n",
      "A separate private survey released on Thursday showed China’s factory activity expanded at the slowest pace in three months in December.\n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - Debenhams (DEB.L) said on Thursday its Finance Director Simon Herrick had quit, two days after the British retailer issued a sharp profit warning due to poor Christmas trading. \n",
      "Herrick, who had held the role for two years, was already under fire after he asked suppliers for a discount and a one-off contribution in the days running up to the key festive period, according to local media reports. \n",
      "The company said a search to find a replacement was underway. \n",
      "Whoever takes the job will be tasked with rebuilding confidence among investors after the group issued its second profit warning in less than a year. Its shares are down almost 40 percent in the last 12 months. \n",
      "In the downgrade delivered on Tuesday, it cut its first-half profit forecast by almost 25 percent after the hoped-for surge in last-minute Christmas shopping failed to materialize. \n",
      "Debenhams, Britain’s second-largest department store group, attributed the latest warning to fierce discounting on the high street, but the group was already struggling as it failed to keep up with rivals John Lewis, House of Fraser and Next (NXT.L). \n",
      "John Lewis, the employee-owned biggest department store, reported like-for-like sales up 6.9 percent in the five weeks to December 28, while House of Fraser sales were up 7.3 percent in the last three weeks. \n",
      "Neil Kennedy, director of finance, will assume the role of acting chief financial officer at Debenhams on an interim basis. \n",

      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Reinsurers could be hit with up to a 25 percent decline in premium revenue over the next 12 months after the number of natural and man-made disasters dropped by half in 2013, a study by reinsurance broker Willis Re said. \n",
      "As well as the relative lack of costly catastrophes, the market remained hampered by oversupply as pension funds and hedge funds increasingly look to offer reinsurance for insurers looking to reduce their potential claims exposure. \n",
      "“The key influence on the Jan. 1 renewals has been overcapacity triggered by a number of converging factors,” Willis Re CEO John Cavanagh said, citing strong results from reinsurers and the increase in capital from non-traditional sources, which he said totalled $50 billion. \n",
      "That trend was compounded by muted demand from buyers as a result of regulatory changes and as leading insurance groups looked to keep more risk on their own books. \n",
      "“A heady cocktail of converging factors has fuelled a soft buyers’ market in nearly all lines of business,” Willis Re said in its 1st View Renewals Report. \n",
      "The biggest hit, of between 10 percent and 25 percent, would be to U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance after a relatively benign hurricane season,” it said. European premiums, meanwhile, could fall by between 10 percent and 15 percent. \n",
      "Hannover Re last week said it expected premiums to fall in 2014, fuelling concern about a possible price war with peers Swiss Re, Munich Re and Berkshire Hathaway to protect market share. \n",
      "In response, some reinsurers have been looking to offer more complex deals, branching out into speciality areas of the market or offering underwriting services to the alternative investors, Willis Re Chairman Peter Hearn said. \n",
      "Faced with the challenge of increasing revenues in such an environment, a number of firms are expected to take a fresh look at mergers and acquisitions, Willis Re added.\n",

      "COLUMN-The Times advances the NSA's amnesty-for-Snowden trial balloon\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) \n",
      "By Jack Shafer \n",
      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Of course the New York Times editorial page wants clemency or, at the very least, a generous plea bargain for National Security Agency contractor turned super-leaker Edward Snowden! The news pages of the New York Times have directly benefited from top-secret leaks from Snowden to break stories since last August, when the paper acquired a cache of his NSA material from the Guardian. (The Guardian published its own “pardon for Snowden” editorial today.) In urging leniency for Snowden, the Times editorial page is urging leniency for a specific news-pages source, which the editorial doesn’t directly state. If that doesn’t define enlightened self-interest, nothing does. \n",
      "The Times editorial page operates independently from the Times news operation, so I’m not suggesting that Executive Editor Jill Abramson instructed Editorial Page Editor Andrew Rosenthal what to write. But on this score, she probably didn’t even have to stifle the urge. For the last decade, the news side has been breaking stories about warrantless surveillance by the NSA, a secret bank-data surveillance program, and, via WikiLeaks, the war logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and the U.S. diplomatic cables. The editorial page has lectured the government on its overreach and incompetence in the security realm. Abramson and Rosenthal, who report to the same publisher, obviously harmonize on this score. Even if they didn’t, it’s unlikely in the extreme that a Times editorial would ever call for a Times news-side source to be seated in a Judas Cradle as punishment for leaking to the press. \n",
      "Did I say unlikely in the extreme? Allow me to reverse my course. Not every editorial page is buckled to its news pages. Take the Washington Post for example. \n",
      "Last summer, a few days after the Post published its first news stories based on the Snowden files, the paper’s editorial page took a hard line on Snowden, surmising on June 11 that “If there is a scandal here, it may be that a government contractor of Mr. Snowden’s status had access to so much highly classified material.” By July 1, the paper was literally editorializing for the government to do everything possible to plug the leaks and for Snowden to surrender to U.S. authorities. At the same time, the paper’s reporters, led by Barton Gellman, were sluicing those very secrets into the Post’s news pages and continue to do so. Just before Christmas, Gellman published on the Post’s Page One a flattering Q&A; with the leaker. The harmony between the editorial and news sides, which I posit as a given at the Times, seems dead at the Post. The anti-Snowden editorials may have softened since the summer, but they still aren’t vectoring toward any call for clemency. \n",
      "You could ridicule the Times editorial for wild, wishful thinking had Rick Ledgett, a top NSA official in charge of the Snowden damage-assessment task force, not also entertained the idea of amnesty on 60 Minutes three weeks ago. “It’s worth having a conversation about,” said Ledgett, who is expected to be the agency’s next No. 2 official. “I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured and my bar for those assurances would be very high.” Ledgett insisted his statement represented a “personal view” - as if top NSA officials expecting promotions are allowed to share their “personal views” about national security on national TV. Was he expressing the agency’s powerlessness to contain future leaks of the 1.7 million documents Snowden’s now believed to have stolen, and trial ballooning the possibility of a deal, or was he gaming Snowden, as I conjectured at the time? \n",
      "Newspaper editorials, in my view, rarely have any impact on the real world. They exist to lend the oversized egos of publishers and owners a sense of power over politicians, politics, and public policy. But sometimes, just sometimes, an editorial can make a difference by adding velocity to an idea already in motion. By publishing its 1,100-word editorial, the Times fills the clemency cup that a top NSA official lathed into being before a television audience. Any criticism of the Times, for promoting clemency, need also address Ledgett’s very public offer of the same with Snowden. His discussion of amnesty on 60 Minutes was about as subtle as a pick-up line shouted across a singles bar at closing time. \n",
      "I can almost see the words forming on ABC News White House correspondent Jon Karl’s lips as he stands to ask a question at President Obama’s next news conference: “Mr. President, the New York Times has editorialized in favor of clemency for Edward Snowden. A top NSA official also publicly explored the possibility of amnesty for Snowden on 60 Minutes. What terms would you propose for a Snowden deal?” \n",
      "The president will duck. He’ll have to duck. But some sort of Snowden deal is still in play. \n",
      "“The government knows where to find us if they want to have a productive conversation about resolutions that don’t involve Edward Snowden behind bars,” Snowden legal adviser Ben Wizner told the Post’s Gellman last week. \n",
      "The next move belongs to Obama.   (Jack Shafer)\n",

      "China denounces U.S. for sending Uighur 'terrorists' to Slovakia\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Foreign Ministry criticized the United States on Thursday for sending the last three Uighur Chinese inmates at the Guantanamo Bay detention center to Slovakia, saying they were “terrorists” who posed a real security danger. \n",
      "Yusef Abbas, Saidullah Khalik, and Hajiakbar Abdul Ghuper are the last of 22 Muslim minority Chinese nationals to be moved from the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba, according to the Pentagon. \n",
      "Slovakia’s Interior Ministry confirmed that it would take in the three. Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim people from China’s far western region of Xinjiang. \n",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the three were members of the separatist East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which Beijing labels a terror group. \n",
      "“They are genuine terrorists. They not only threaten China’s security, they will threaten the security of the country that receives them,” he told a daily news briefing. \n",
      "“China hopes that the relevant country ... does not give asylum to terrorists, and sends them back to China as soon as possible.” \n",
      "Qin added that China did not appreciate a recent U.S. State Department call for Chinese security forces to exercise restraint following the latest outbreak of violence in Xinjiang, also blamed by Beijing on “terrorists”. \n",
      "“These remarks neglect the facts and are feeble,” he said. “We urge the United States to abandon their double standards when it comes to terrorism, and immediately stop saying one thing and doing another, to avoid sending the wrong message to violent terrorist forces.” \n",
      "The United States said it was grateful to Slovakia for its “humanitarian gesture.” \n",
      "Most of the Uighurs at Guantanamo were captured near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in late 2001, and were believed to have trained with the Taliban. But U.S. officials have deemed they pose no threat to the United States. \n",
      "In 2008, a U.S. court ordered that they be released. They have been resettled in El Salvador, Switzerland, Bermuda, Albania, and the Pacific island nation of Palau. \n",
      "The U.S. government has said it will not return the Uighurs to China because they would face persecution there. \n",
      "Many Uighurs chafe at restrictions on their culture, language and religion, though the government insists it grants them broad freedoms. \n",
      "The region has been beset by violence with at least 91 people, including several police, killed in unrest in Xinjiang since April, according to state media reports. \n",
      "China has blamed some of the violence on Islamist militants with connections to foreign groups, including al Qaeda, plotting holy war. \n",
      "Many rights groups and exiles say China exaggerates the militant threat to justify its firm grip on energy-rich Xinjiang, which abuts Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. \n",

      "UPDATE 3-Debenhams finance chief quits as rivals triumph in Christmas battle\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "(Adds details, comments, House of Fraser comparison) \n",
      "By Neil Maidment and Kate Holton \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The finance chief of Debenhams Plc  quit on Thursday after trading updates showed just how far the 200-year-old British retailer had fallen behind rivals John Lewis and House of Fraser over the crucial Christmas period. \n",
      "The departure of Simon Herrick from Britain’s second-largest department stores group follows a profit warning on Tuesday, its second in less than a year, after the company admitted its margins had been squeezed by heavy discounts that nonetheless failed to spark a late surge in festive spending. \n",
      "Debenhams blamed a 25 percent cut to its first-half profit forecast on an industry-wide outbreak of Christmas promotions that left many British stores emblazoned with “sale” signs, as well as the impact of mild autumn weather on demand for warm clothing and continued pressure on household incomes. \n",
      "But some analysts said Debenhams has struggled more than most due to its weaker online offering, reliance on discount offers - whose impact may damage its image over time - and own-brand ranges that lack the cachet of labels found at rivals. \n",
      "“We are confident that the strong updates from House of Fraser and John Lewis will put them both firmly in the ‘winners’ column this year, but .. see enough to suggest that Debenhams’ problems are more company-specific than market-led,” analysts at brokerage Numis said. \n",
      "Debenhams stores have also failed to keep pace with the more modern outlets of John Lewis, Britain’s biggest department store group, which has outperformed competitors in recent years due to its strong web presence, attractive stores and more affluent customer base focused in southeast England. \n",
      "Both John Lewis and House of Fraser posted record Christmas sales on the back of demand for fashion and electrical items and growing online trade. \n",
      "“With a price-matching promise instead of a discounting strategy on branded products and only infrequent planned discounting on its private labels, John Lewis does not devalue its product offer,” Verdict research analyst Kate Ormond said. \n",
      "Similarly, smaller House of Fraser, which made a loss before tax and one-off items of 6.9 million pounds ($11.4 million) in its last fiscal year, is benefiting from disciplined discounting and a shift to higher-priced products. “House of Fraser is a bit more of a premium price level for a more premium product... When you want to treat someone, people are prepared to step up,” Verdict’s Patrick O’Brien said. \n",
      "Debenhams, which has 238 stores in 29 countries and sells online in 67 countries, has said despite discounts of up to 50 percent in the run-up to Christmas, prices would be slashed further in January and February to shift stock,  knocking 80 to 100 basis points off its first-half gross margin. \n",
      "Over the 17 weeks to Dec. 28, Debenhams eked out 0.1 percent like-for-like sales growth, well behind the 4.3 percent and 6.9 percent recorded by House of Fraser and John Lewis respectively in the shorter reporting periods of nine and five weeks to Dec. 28. \n",
      "Analysts at Numis expect Debenhams’ UK business to post a fourth-straight year of earnings decline this year, dropping from 174 million pounds in 2010 to 95 million. \n",
      "Despite having 156 UK stores against the 40 run by John Lewis, Debenhams trails the latter in both sales and profits. In the year through of August 2013, Debenhams posted gross sales in Britain of 2.3 billion pounds, with operating profit of 140 million. \n",
      "In its 2013 full year, John Lewis stores - which do not include the Waitrose supermarket arm - posted gross sales of 3.8 billion pounds and operating profit of 217 million. \n",
      "Faced with falling “footfall” or store visitors, the group is in the middle of a programme to modernise its stores, such as a 25 million pound makeover of its flagship on London’s Oxford Street, and is working to improve its online presence. \n",
      "Debenhams, which traces its history back to 1813, made around 16 percent of sales online, versus 32 percent for John Lewis in the most recent trading updates. \n",
      "Shares in the group are down almost 40 percent in the last 12 months, falling 12.5 percent on Tuesday alone after it said it now expected first half-profit to be in the region of 85 million pounds, around 23 percent off analysts’ forecasts. \n",
      "The profit warning was also an ominous sign for Britain’s biggest clothing retailer Marks & Spencer, whose rare move to slash 30 percent off clothing prices in the run up to Christmas has prompted fears it too had suffered poor trading. \n",
      "The departure of Debenhams CFO Herrick after two years in the role had been trailed in local media reports, after he came under fire for asking suppliers for a discount and a one-off contribution in the days running up to the key festive period. \n",
      "The firm said director of finance Neil Kennedy will assume the role on an interim basis while a replacement is sought. ($1 = 0.6038 British pounds)   (Editing by David Holmes)\n",

      "U.S. factory, jobs data show underlying strength in economy\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity held near a 2-1/2-year high in December and the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell again last week, suggesting the economy was poised for stronger growth in 2014. \n",
      "The strengthening fundamentals were underscored by other data on Thursday showing construction spending hit its highest level in nearly five years in November. \n",
      "“The underlying trends are pointing to the economy accelerating as we move through the year. Conditions seem to be coming together for a very good year,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. \n",
      "The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity stood at 57.0 last month. The index had climbed to 57.3 in November, the highest since April 2011. \n",
      "A reading above 50 indicates expansion. With a gauge of new orders hitting a 3-1/2-year high and inventories declining, manufacturing activity is set to accelerate early in the year. \n",
      "While manufacturing accounts for only about 12 percent of the economy, it has been the key driver of recovery from the 2007-09 recession. Its continued show of strength is combining with improving fortunes in other sectors of the economy to set a foundation for sustained strong growth this year. \n",
      "The brightening economic outlook prompted the Federal Reserve to announce in December that it would reduce its monthly $85 billion bond buying program by $10 billion starting this month. \n",
      "A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 339,000 last week. It was the second straight week of declines. \n",
      "Though claims continue to be plagued by seasonal volatility, economists said last week’s decline was consistent with an improvement in labor market conditions and was in line with other indicators showing an acceleration in job growth. \n",
      "A gauge of factory employment in the ISM survey last month touched its highest level since June 2011. There has also been a significant improvement in households’ perceptions of labor market conditions. \n",
      "“Jobless claims remain at a level consistent with improving labor market conditions. We continue to expect a 215,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls for December,” said Laura Rosner, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in New York. \n",
      "Employers added 203,000 new jobs to their payrolls in November and the unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage point to 7 percent. December nonfarm payrolls data will be released on January 10, with the median of forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters calling for 193,000 new jobs last month. \n",
      "From employment to consumer spending and industrial production, the economy is showing remarkable strength, even as growth is expected to slow considerably in the last three months of 2013 from the third quarter’s brisk 4.1 percent annual rate. \n",
      "Much of the anticipated slowdown reflects a loss of output during a 16-day government shutdown in October and an unwinding of inventories after businesses aggressively accumulated stock in the July-September quarter. \n",
      "The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were up. U.S. stocks fell as investors booked profits after the Standard & Poor’s 500 index recorded its best yearly advance since 1997. \n",
      "A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending increased 1 percent in November to its highest level since March 2009. It was the eighth straight month that construction spending increased and reflected solid gains in private construction outlays. \n",

      "Teen eating disorders may impact weight later: study\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Young teens who binge eat and those who are fearful of weight gain may be more likely to become overweight later in adolescence, according to a new study from the United Kingdom. \n",
      "Researchers looked for early symptoms of eating disorders among more than 7,000 13-year-olds and found certain symptoms predicted which children would have weight problems at age 15. \n",
      "Girls who engaged in binge eating at 13 tended to have a higher body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height, two years later. \n",
      "Both boys and girls who severely restricted their eating at 13 had lower BMIs when they were two years older. \n",
      "“The most important message is that even at this young age, a high percentage of boys and girls have worrying eating disorders symptoms,” Dr. Nadia Micali told Reuters Health in an email. \n",
      "Micali led the study from the Institute of Child Health at University College London. \n",
      "She and her colleagues gathered data from an ongoing UK trial that includes parents and kids. From surveys filled out by parents, the researchers collected information on eating disorder symptoms among 7,082 teens at age 13 - such as binging, excessive concerns over body weight or shape and behaviors like restricting food intake. \n",
      "The team also looked at links between these symptoms and other aspects of the teens’ social, academic, extracurricular and family lives. \n",
      "Overall, 63 percent of girls and 39 percent of boys were afraid of gaining weight or getting fat. Extreme levels of fear of weight gain or concerns about body shape or weight were seen among 11 percent of girls. \n",
      "Girls avoided fatty foods more often than boys, while boys were more likely to do intense exercise for weight loss. \n",
      "Even at age 13, overeating and binging was strongly linked to negative impacts on the child’s life and burden to family among both boys and girls, the researchers report in the Journal of Adolescent Health. \n",
      "Binging and overeating were especially linked to emotional and behavioral troubles for both genders. Cutting back on food was linked to mental health disturbances among boys more than girls. \n",
      "Excessive concern over weight and shape also had a significant impact on girls, Micali notes, “but parents probably don’t recognize the impact of this pattern on a child’s life in boys,” Micali said. \n",
      "The findings are a reminder that boys do suffer from eating disorders and related problems (see Reuters Health article of November 5, 2013 here: reut.rs/1cOa04x) \n",
      "According to Kathleen Merikangas, chief of the Genetic Epidemiology Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health, the results suggest that “lack of regular eating patterns could be a target for intervention and prevention of obesity in youth.” \n",
      "Merikangas, who was not involved in the research, added, the take-home message remained clear for parents: eating disorders during the teen years offer a window into the risk of obesity later. Parents need to be aware if their child has a distorted image of their body, Merikangas said. \n",
      "“Pretending not to notice or thinking that eating disorders behavior will go away” are not good strategies, Micali said. \n",
      "“Talk to them to understand if their eating disorder behaviors are a reflection of other more deep-seated problems,” Micali said. “Try not to be confrontational but supportive and firm.” \n",
      "“If they are worried, parents should seek help from a health professional,” she said. \n",
      "SOURCE: bit.ly/JqBTGK Journal of Adolescent Health, online December 18, 2013. \n",
      "This December 31, 2013 story has been corrected to fix association between binge eating and weight in paragraph three.\n",

      "Dollar posts largest daily gain in five months on upbeat data\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a two-week high on Thursday as a slew of generally positive U.S. economic data reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to move away from its bond purchases. \n",
      "The greenback also posted its largest daily gain in five months against a basket of currencies. \n",
      "U.S. factory activity held near a 2-1/2-year high in December and the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell again last week, suggesting the world’s largest economy was on stable footing \n",
      "U.S. construction spending hit its highest level in nearly five years in November. \n",
      "Against a backdrop of a firming jobs market and brightening economic outlook, the Fed said in December it would reduce its monthly $85 billion bond buying program by $10 billion starting in January. \n",
      "“This year is America’s time to shine and based on the latest economic reports, the U.S. economy is indeed outperforming the market’s expectations,” said Kathy Lien, managing director, at BK Asset Management in New York. \n",
      "The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, rose 0.7 percent on the day to 80.631 .DXY, its largest one-day gain in five months. The index hit a high of 80.709, its strongest level since December 20. \n",

      "Western Sahara dispute dims Morocco's solar dreams\n",
      "\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "RABAT (Reuters) - A Moroccan solar project worth some $9 billion (6.6 billion euros) aimed at turning desert sun into lucrative power exports to Europe could be at risk as international lenders balk at plants planned for the disputed Western Sahara. \n",
      "Morocco drew up plans in 2009 to build solar plants and wind farms to generate 4 gigawatts of power by 2020 but much of that output is to come from sites planned in Western Sahara, the focus of a decades-old territorial dispute. \n",
      "Morocco has controlled most of Western Sahara since 1975 and claims the sparsely populated stretch of desert, which has offshore fishing, phosphate reserves and oilfield potential, as its own. \n",
      "However, the Algeria-backed Polisario Front seeks independence and a United Nations mission was formed more than 20 years ago ahead of an expected referendum on Western Sahara’s political future which has never taken place. \n",
      "The dispute was rekindled in October when Morocco recalled its ambassador from Algeria after that country’s president upset Rabat by calling for human rights monitors to be sent to the region. \n",
      "Western Sahara has also drawn scrutiny as European and U.S. authorities worry that damaged relations between Morocco and Algeria could hurt cooperation against Islamist militants who are active across the Maghreb. \n",
      "Morocco’s plans call for building five solar power plants, including two in Western Sahara - a 500 megawatt (MW) plant at Foum El Oued and a 100 MW plant near Boujdour. Another 500 MW project is planned at Sabkhat Tah which borders Western Sahara. \n",
      "Yet lending sources at German state-owned bank KFW, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the European Union have told Reuters they will not finance projects based in Western Sahara. \n",
      "“If we support those investments, it would look like we are supporting the Moroccan position. We are neutral regarding that conflict,” one senior bank source said. \n",
      "A second source said: “We have never supported any project in that territory (Western Sahara), and we won’t, although the Moroccan solar plan means a lot for us.” \n",
      "All the sources declined to be named because of the political sensitivity of the matter. \n",
      "Progress on the solar projects has so far been limited to one site within Morocco where Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power is building a 160 MW solar plant in the city of Ouarzazate. \n",
      "MASEN, Morocco’s solar energy agency, plans to launch tenders soon for construction of two more plants worth 1.7 billion euros - one of 100 MW and another of 200 MW - also near Ouarzazate. \n",
      "Germany’s KFW backed a 654-million-euro loan in October to part-finance these. \n",
      "Mines and Energy Minister Abdelkader Amara said Morocco dismissed concerns over financing though he acknowledged plans for Western Sahara were not yet finalised. \n",
      "“In the initial plan, three solar power plants of five are based in the southern provinces (Western Sahara), but we have not yet decided all those areas yet,” he said. \n",
      "“If those institutions say that they would not finance them, we will see at the time.” \n",
      "Sources say Morocco may seek alternative bilateral financing from Arab Gulf states already invested in the kingdom if KFW and others balk at backing the sites planned for Western Sahara. \n",
      "But they say these investors may also be skittish over such investment and would be unlikely to finance the whole of it. \n",
      "While rights groups such as Amnesty International accuse Morocco of continuing to use excessive force against activists and repressing political freedom in Western Sahara, Rabat invests heavily there hoping to calm social unrest and independence claims. \n",
      "Yet any investment involving international firms stirs protests over the legitimacy of Moroccans to negotiate on behalf of the Western Saharan population. \n",
      "EU lawmakers approved a fisheries agreement with Morocco last month, allowing European ships into Moroccan and Western Saharan waters, two years after rejecting a similar deal out of concern it might strengthen Rabat’s control over Western Sahara. \n",
      "Morocco’s official media portrayed the EU fishing deal as a political victory while the Polisario Front dubbed it a violation of international law. \n",
      "Kosmos Energy and Cairn Energy last year also started seismic surveys off Cap Boujdour in Western Sahara and plan to drill an exploration petroleum well. \n",
      "“We respect international laws. We have started oil exploration and have signed a fishing agreement with the European Union,” Amara said. \n",
      "“So I don’t see why we could not get the financing needed for those solar power projects.” \n",
      "Moroccan lawmakers drew up a renewable energy law in 2009 which helped attract foreign investors including German industrial and financial firms which set up the north Africa-focused Desertec Industrial Initiative (DII). \n",
      "However, some members have since quit the DII, including manufacturers Siemens and Bosch, and European efforts to bolster production of renewable energy have reduced Europe’s need for potential North African imports. \n",
      "Morocco has domestic demand for such power, however, as the country remains heavily reliant on energy imports. \n",

      "Snapchat says millions of user accounts compromised\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Snapchat, the red-hot private messaging service, said on Thursday that it knew for months about a security loophole that allowed hackers this week to harvest millions of phone numbers and announced changes to its systems. \n",
      "An anonymous group called Snapchat DB posted the usernames and phone numbers of 4.6 million Snapchat users on New Year’s Eve, days after the startup - headed by 23-year old founder Evan Spiegel - brushed off warnings that its app still contained security loopholes. \n",
      "The hacker group, which claimed to be based in the United States and Europe, made the entire database available for download but redacted the last two digits of every phone number. Snapchat DB said it was working to raise awareness about Snapchat’s security holes, not out of malicious intent. \n",
      "In its first public statement since the leak, Snapchat said in a blog post on Thursday that no “snaps” - the contents of messages - were compromised or accessed as part of the hack. \n",
      "Snapchat was first alerted to the vulnerability in August by a security group called Gibson Security. Snapchat said it made changes to its system to address the weaknesses, but the company also published a blog post downplaying the threat as “theoretical” on Dec. 27. \n",
      "Snapchat DB carried out the hack and disclosed the phone numbers just four days later. \n",
      "The hack was a rare black eye for a high-flying appmaker started by Stanford University undergraduates in 2011. Snapchat has soared in popularity over the past year because it allows its users - mostly teens - to send private pictures and messages that self-destruct after 10 seconds at most. \n",
      "Snapchat’s immense popularity among young users has made it one of the most closely watched social media companies in the world, and Facebook Inc reportedly offered $3 billion last year in a failed acquisition bid. \n",
      "Snapchat asks new users for their phone number so that their friends can find them on the service. The phone numbers were not attached to any real names. \n",
      "Calling the hackers’ disclosure an “abuse” of its system, Snapchat said Thursday that it was first told by security experts in August that its “Find Friends” feature may contain a weakness. \n",
      "The company did not apologize for the leaks but said it would carry out some changes to prevent further unwanted disclosures. \n",
      "“We will be releasing an updated version of the Snapchat application that will allow Snapchatters to opt out of appearing in Find Friends after they have verified their phone number,” the company wrote. “We’re also improving rate limiting and other restrictions to address future attempts to abuse our service.” \n",
      "Rate limiting restricts how many times a party can query the Snapchat servers. \n",
      "In an email to Reuters, the group claiming to be behind the New Years Eve hack called it “promising” that Snapchat was beginning to address its security vulnerabilities. \n",
      "“Let’s hope they aren’t trying to downplay the situation once again and avoid the heat, but instead taking reasonable steps to secure sensitive user information,” Snapchat DB said. “Actions speak louder than words.”\n",

      "Fiat shares jump on Chrysler merger deal\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "MILAN (Reuters) - Fiat’s $4.35 billion deal to gain full control of Chrysler Group LLC sent its shares to a near 2-1/2-year high on Thursday, despite doubts over whether the Italian carmaker could use the merger to cut losses in Europe. \n",
      "Investors welcomed the deal struck by Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, under which Fiat will buy the 41.46 percent of the No. 3 U.S. automaker it does not already own, without raising funds from the stock market. \n",
      "Marchionne, who has run both companies since Chrysler’s 2009 U.S. government-funded bankruptcy restructuring, aims to merge the two into the world’s seventh-largest auto group. \n",
      "However, analysts were concerned that the deal will increase Fiat’s already heavy debt burden, despite a relatively low price negotiated by Marchionne after more than a year of talks. \n",
      "Fiat shares rose as much as 16 percent to levels last seen in August 2011 after the deal, which aims to combine the two automakers’ resources and rejuvenate Fiat’s product line-up. It was the stock’s biggest intraday gain since April 2009. \n",
      "“They paid less than the market had expected, and there will be no capital increase to fund this, so no wonder the stock is flying,” a Milan-based trader said. \n",
      "“While it’s still to be seen how this will bode for Fiat’s future, this is a good start to the year for a company that has had quite a tough ride recently, especially in Europe.” \n",
      "Fiat will buy the stake in the U.S. group from a retirees’ healthcare trust affiliated to the United Auto Workers union, with Chrysler putting up most of the funding. \n",
      "However, Citigroup analysts said Fiat’s debt would become the highest for any European motor manufacturer. \n",
      "“Group net debt will rise to around 10 billion euros ($13.8 billion),” they said in a note. “We continue to have concerns about the sustainability of this heavy debt burden.” \n",
      "It remains to be seen whether the merger will cut Fiat’s losses in Europe, where it had promised to break even by 2016. Fiat’s plan depends on its ability to share technology, cash and dealer networks with Chrysler easily and cheaply. \n",
      "Chrysler and Fiat currently have to manage their finances separately. A full merger will make it easier - but not automatic - to combine the cash pools of the two companies, giving Fiat more funds to expand its product line-up. \n",
      "Fitch ratings agency said Fiat may not immediately be able to fully access Chrysler’s cash as this would require a refinancing of the U.S. firm’s credit agreement and bonds. Fitch will review its rating in early 2014. \n",
      "Chrysler’s booming U.S. sales are now a profit center for Fiat, helping to offset losses in Europe. The deal raises expectations that investments could be channeled into underused Italian plants to launch new models in what analysts expect to be a steadying market from 2014. \n",
      "Italy’s unions and government hope the deal will boost jobs and cut state spending. Several Fiat plants have been working only a few days a month, with thousands of workers currently in state-backed temporary lay-off schemes to avoid job losses. \n",
      "“It’s essential that Fiat tells us what they plan to do in our country,” Susanna Camusso, head of the CGIL union, said. \n",
      "Fiat has repeatedly reassured unions and politicians it does not intend to close factories, unlike some of its competitors, but doubts remain, given Fiat’s growing U.S. presence. Analysts already said a U.S. listing could be the next step. \n",
      "“We assume Fiat will go on to pursue a U.S. listing of some sort in due course,” Bernstein said in a note. \n",
      "Fiat has said it plans to build Jeeps and a new line of Alfa Romeos in Italy for export to markets in Asia, Latin America and the United States to offset flagging demand in crisis-hit Italy. A new industrial plan outlining Fiat’s overall spending strategy and models will be released in April. \n",
      "But whether Marchionne will put billions of euros into Italy and Europe, where the group has lost much of its market position in recent years, or elsewhere is still uncertain. \n",
      "“The bad news is that he’s spent no money for the past two years at Fiat because he was waiting for this to happen,” said a London-based analyst at a major investment bank. \n",
      "“He’s not getting any exposure to European recovery. The U.S. asset is not as good as its peers and needs money spent on it. Marchionne has shown he can get the job done, but I’m still buying a dream.” \n",
      "By 1558 GMT Fiat shares were up 15.2 percent at 6.86 euros, with traded volume six times the previous month’s daily average. \n",
      "($1 = 0.7257 euros) \n",

      "* Imposes 0.8 yuan/litre tax on biodiesel, some types of kerosene \n",
      "* Move may curb China’s diesel exports, support Asian refining margins   (Adds details) \n",
      "BEIJING, Jan 2 (Reuters) - China started levying a consumption tax on imported biodiesel and some types of kerosene from the start of the new year, the customs office said, a move aimed at curbing imports of the fuels that have taken market share from state refiners. \n",
      "The tax could create a supply gap for diesel in the world’s second largest oil consumer that would force state refiners to scale back exports. That would support Asian processing margins, which have been recently boosted by a refinery outage in Taiwan. \n",
      "The government imposed a consumption tax of 0.8 yuan ($0.13) per litre on biodiesel, lamp kerosene and other kerosene grades, Chinese customs said on its website (www.customs.gov.cn). \n",
      "Biodiesel imports, mostly by private companies, surged to an estimated 1.7 million tonnes in 2013 on tax and trade incentives. But some shipments contain a far lower biofuel component than required by China, according to sources. \n",
      "As a result, imported biodiesel displaced local diesel sales, prompting state refiners Sinopec Corp   and PetroChina  to boost diesel exports to record highs last year. \n",
      "Small refiners and independent fuel dealers in late 2010 imported power kerosene, a blend not subject to consumption taxes and that could be easily turned into diesel. The practice eventually led to detention and fines for two traders. \n",

      "© 2018 Reuters. All Rights Reserved.UPDATE 2-Bakken crude may be more flammable than previously thought -U.S. regulator\n",
      "\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "By Patrick Rucker \n",
      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Crude oil produced in North Dakota may be more flammable and prone to explosions than earlier thought, U.S. officials said on Thursday as they examine whether gas trapped in crude-by-rail shipments could explain a spate of fiery accidents. \n",
      "In the latest crash involving fuel produced in an oil patch known as the Bakken, several tank cars exploded after a collision on a desolate stretch of North Dakota track on Monday. \n",
      "In that case, as with several other accidents in recent months, tank cars exploded with a force that surprised investigators. \n",
      "The incidents “indicate that the type of crude being transported from the Bakken region may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil,” the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said on Thursday. \n",
      "New drilling methods like hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have unlocked vast oil deposits and producers eager to maximize profits often try to supply refiners off the national pipeline grid who are willing to pay more for the fuel. \n",
      "That market pull is one reason over two-thirds of North Dakota’s oil production is currently shipped by rail. \n",
      "Northern Oil & Gas Inc, Oasis Petroleum Inc  and Continental Resources are among the Bakken producers whose shares dipped on Thursday. \n",
      "Regulators are working to tighten train transport safety and if those rules are costly to enforce, analysts say, it could cut into crude-by-rail profits. \n",
      "“Depending on what it costs to fix this problem, you could be eating into the dynamics that have put so much crude oil on the tracks in the first place,” said David Vernon, a transportation analyst with research firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. \n",
      "Crude-by-rail safety has been closely scrutinized since July when a runaway oil train carrying light crude from the Bakken derailed and exploded in the center of the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic, killing 47 people. \n",
      "The devastation caused by that accident and fireballs that have followed other derailments prompted regulators to scrutinize the contents of tank cars. \n",
      "PHMSA officials have examined whether Bakken crude is unduly corrosive, more sulfurous or loaded with explosive gas as it moves on the tracks from oil fields to distant refineries. \n",
      "On Thursday, Bakken producers were warned to “sufficiently degasify” crude oil being loaded onto tank cars, and officials said they will examine the “dissolved gas content” of crude oil shipments. \n",
      "Packing gas onto tank cars meant to carry liquid fuels can push the pressure to dangerous levels and provoke explosions, industry officials have said. \n",
      "“Large amounts of vapor pressure can split the tank, sink the roof and emit (a) flammable gas cloud,” the Canadian Crude Quality Technical Association, an industry-sponsored research group, concluded in March. \n",
      "Bakken producers have recently reported a large amount of corrosion in tank cars and “high vapor pressure causing bubbling crude,” the trade group said. \n",
      "Tesoro Logistics LP reported in March that pressure on Bakken crude shipments was likely to exceed federal safety standards. \n",
      "U.S. railroads want tank car manufactures to upgrade the national fleet with new safety standards that could cost the industry more than $3 billion, according to a Reuters estimate. \n",
      "If regulators opt for such standards and give the tank car industry a short time to comply, the hit to the Bakken energy sector could be severe at a time when crude-by-rail traffic is climbing. \n",
      "Trains carried nearly 700,000 barrels a day of North Dakota oil to market in October, a 67 percent jump from a year earlier, according to the state pipeline authority. \n",
      "Most of those deliveries are in 100-car ‘unit trains’ that can move huge crude volumes in unbroken shipments but that can intensify dangerous spills and derailments. \n",
      "If regulators deem unit trains dangerous - as some in the rail industry have conceded - then oil producers might also lose an efficiency that has made rail shipments an attractive alternative to pipelines.\n",

      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - World equity markets kicked off 2014 with a whimper on Thursday as slightly disappointing Chinese manufacturing data triggered some profit-taking, while oil prices were sharply lower as Libya prepared to reopen a major oilfield. \n",
      "U.S. stock indexes posted their largest falls in three weeks on the first trading day of 2014, after the benchmark S&P; 500  finished its best year since 1997. \n",
      "The dollar rallied against a basket of major currencies  as U.S. jobs, housing and manufacturing data gave support to the Federal Reserve’s decision to start slowing its stimulus program this month. \n",

      "YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar’s president gave his backing on Thursday for amending a military drafted constitution and indicated support for changes that would make Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi eligible to lead the country. \n",
      "Thein Sein, the reformist general and former top member of the army regime that ruled Myanmar for 49 years, said changing the constitution could help national reconciliation and he did not support laws that bar anyone from becoming president. \n",
      "“I would not want restrictions being imposed on the right of any citizen to become the leader of the country,” Thein Sein said in a monthly televised address to the nation. \n",
      "“At the same time, we will need to have all necessary measures in place in order to defend our national interests and sovereignty.” \n",
      "The comments by the president are likely to be welcomed by opposition leader Suu Kyi, the 68-year-old leader of a peaceful two-decade struggle against military dictatorship, who has in recent months stated her wish to become president. \n",
      "For now, Suu Kyi is ineligible for the top post because her two sons are British citizens. \n",
      "The comments are the latest show of openness by a president who has surprised the world with an array of reforms that were unimaginable under the junta, like the release of hundreds of political prisoners, liberal investment laws, legalizing protests and scrapping of media censorship. \n",
      "Thein Sein, 68, has yet to declare whether or not he will retire from politics after the next election in 2015, or seek a second term. Other contenders include parliament speaker, Shwe Mann, 66, another key reformer who outranked Thein Sein in the former junta. \n",
      "According to Myanmar’s constitution, the legislature, not the people, are responsible for choosing a president. \n",
      "Three panels representing the lower house, the senate and lawmakers chosen by the military each nominate a presidential candidate. A vote of the bicameral parliament then takes place, where one of the three candidates is chosen as leader. \n",

      "The committee said on Wednesday it had received 323,110 suggestions via 28,247 letters ahead of the December 31 deadline for public feedback. It is expected to submit its report during the next house session, which starts on January 13. \n",

      "(Reuters) - Masters champion Adam Scott goes into this week’s $5.7 million Hyundai Tournament of Champions on the Hawaiian island of Maui hoping to maintain an extraordinary run of momentum that capped a breakthrough 2013 season. \n",
      "Having won his first major title in gripping fashion at a rain-soaked Augusta National in April, the Australian ended the year with two wins, a runner-up spot and a third placing in the land of his birth to cement his status as the world number two. \n",
      "That astonishing run, which very nearly earned him only the second ‘triple crown’ of wins in Australia, helped Scott edge out world number one Tiger Woods as Player of the Year on Thursday in voting by the Golf Writers Association of America. \n",
      "“I’ve had a great run and hopefully I’m going to keep it going this year,” Scott, 33, told Golf Channel while preparing for Friday’s opening round at the Kapalua Resort where he will tee off along with defending champion Dustin Johnson. \n",
      "“I feel like this is my time to achieve what I want out of the game so I’ve got to keep the momentum going because it’s hard to find when you don’t have it. While you’ve got it, you’ve got to take advantage of it.” \n",
      "Asked to pinpoint the main reason for his stunning form during 2013, Scott replied: “It’s hard to put it done to one thing. I think it’s probably more an accumulation of a couple of years of working on the right things in my game. \n",
      "“And then it’s all about executing it and just believing a little more in everything I’m doing and letting it happen under pressure.” \n",
      "Nine months ago, Scott became the first Australian to win the Masters, beating Argentina’s Angel Cabrera in a playoff of high emotion and excellent sportsmanship, then followed up by claiming a FedExCup playoff victory at The Barclays in August. \n",
      "He ended the season by winning the Australian PGA and the Australian Masters, teamed up with Jason Day to land the team event at the World Cup and was second in the Australian Open. \n",
      "Asked how he managed to deal with the heightened media scrutiny, both in United States and at home in Australia, Scott replied: “There are some adjustments to be made but so far it’s only all been good stuff. \n",
      "“It’s not hard to receive these things. They are great honors I’ve been given and I’m really lucky to get that. I’ve just tried to enjoy it the most I can. I was so excited just to go back to Australia. \n",
      "“My friends and family were so excited to see me, and then to see how much everyone else embraced me winning the Masters and to share that kind of excitement and to hear the stories of how they celebrated was great.” \n",
      "In pursuit of an 11th victory on the PGA Tour, Scott will have to contend with an elite, winners-only field of 30 which includes PGA Championship winner Jason Dufner and fellow U.S. Ryder Cup players Matt Kuchar and Zach Johnson. \n",
      "However, there are five notable absentees from those qualified to compete this week at Kapalua - Woods, Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson and Graeme McDowell. \n",
      "Long-hitting Dustin Johnson will defend the title he won by three shots last year in a tournament reduced to three rounds and forced to a rare Tuesday finish because of relentless howling winds at the Kapalua Resort. \n",
      "Long established as the opening event on the PGA Tour, this week’s edition is the seventh in the new ‘wrap-around’ season for 2013-14. \n",

      "5 Min Read\n",
      "(adds data on UN markets from paragraph 11) \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The value of global carbon markets dropped 38 percent to 38.4 billion euros ($52.9 billion) in 2013, as prices slid in the main EU and U.N. schemes and trade limited in new programmes, analysts at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon said on Thursday. \n",
      "The value of carbon permits and credits traded was down from 62 billion euros in 2012 and 96 billion euros in 2011, a two-year period in which benchmark EU carbon permit prices fell to 5 euros per tonne from 18 euros, the analysts said in a a report. \n",
      "Last year also saw a decrease in volume, with 9.2 billion emission units changing hands compared to 10.7 billion in 2012, the first drop in turnover since 2010. \n",
      "“The main explanation for the falling prices in carbon markets around the world is the very modest emission reduction targets adopted for the period up to 2020,” Point Carbon’s Anders Nordeng said. \n",
      "“Without ambitious climate targets there is no need for deep emission reductions and carbon prices will remain at low levels.” \n",
      "In an effort to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming, many governments have set up markets that cap emissions and allow emitting companies to trade excess permits. \n",
      "The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has operated since 2005 and represented 94 percent of the value and 88 percent of the traded volume of global carbon markets in 2013, the analysts said. \n",
      "Prices in the EU scheme have fallen as rigid supply rules flooded the market with permits as demand ebbed amid the bloc’s economic downturn. \n",
      "Last month, EU lawmakers agreed to cut supply temporarily in an attempt to push prices back towards levels that stimulate companies to invest in carbon-cutting technology. The move followed more than a year of wrangling amid concerns that higher prices could hamper the bloc’s economic recovery. \n",
      "The so-called backloading proposal, which delays the sale of permits from scheduled auctions, is not expected to take effect until March at the earliest. Analysts say that without further reform, it will not push prices much higher than 5 euros. \n",
      "The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI), the carbon offset schemes created under the United Nations, suffered an even greater decline in 2013. \n",
      "Trade in U.N. credits dropped 96 percent in value and 75 percent in volume to 299 million euros and 742 million units respectively, the analysts said. \n",
      "The CDM and JI allow developers of carbon-cutting projects to earn credits that can sold to governments or companies seeking to meet emission targets, with some 2.2 billion units generated since their inception in 2005. \n",
      "But fresh investment has dried up as credit prices have crashed 98 percent in five years to less than 50 cents, lower than the cost of developing the projects. \n",
      "Additional demand for the U.N. credits has failed to emerge via fresh government targets and the EU this year banned credits from new schemes from all but the world’s poorest nations in an effort to get emerging nations such as China, Brazil and Russia to pay for more of their own emission reductions. \n",
      "North American carbon markets were the only ones to have grown in volume and value over 2013. \n",
      "The fledging market spanning California and Quebec now has the highest permit prices in the world, at $10.71 per tonne, said Point Carbon’s Olga Chistyakova. \n",
      "The analysts added that the launch of five of seven planned carbon markets in China in the second half of 2013 had great potential to reverse the overall decline in global carbon markets due to the sheer size of the schemes, which are in Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin. \n",
      "Nordeng said talks on a global deal to tackle climate change due to be struck in late 2015 would be a key test on whether big-emitting countries would set or deepen emission reduction targets to tackle climate change effectively. \n",
      "“If the goal to limit global warming to two degrees (Celsius) shall be met, more dramatic cuts are needed over the next decades,” said Nordeng, referring to a 2010 agreement by almost 200 nations under the U.N. to limit the rise in global temperature.

      "Spain's Codere in debt talks to avoid insolvency\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish gaming group Codere (CDRE.MC) said on Thursday it is seeking protection from creditors and starting talks to avoid insolvency, after struggling to keep up with debt payments in recent months because of higher tax bills and other costs. \n",
      "The company is the latest in Spanish to run into trouble even as the country slowly emerges from recession, with bankruptcies handled in court in 2013 up 15 percent from the year before, according to official data. \n",
      "Codere’s problems, however, stem mainly from its overseas businesses. The company blamed its cash shortage on the closure of several gaming outlets in Mexico, license renewal costs in Argentina and tax increases in various countries. \n",
      "Codere had 1.27 billion euros ($1.73 billion) of debt at the end of last September, according to company filings, including three bond issues and other loans. It has up to four months to reach a deal with banks and investors. \n",
      "The loss-making company made several late payments on bond coupons in recent months as it tried to win time to restructure its debts. It warned on Thursday that it may be unable to repay a 127 million euro loan due on January 5 if it does not first reach an agreement with lenders. \n",
      "International private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), through its credit arm GSO Capital Partners, and hedge fund Canyon Capital LLC are among investors that have bought up Codere debt in recent months. \n",
      "The two U.S. firms gave the company extra credit lines to tide it over and help it pay coupons. \n",
      "Codere has become a prominent example of how the opaque market for credit default swaps (CDS) can drive creditors to influence a company’s debt payment schedule rather than just hedge their bets on its debt. \n",
      "In September, Codere made an intentional late coupon payment on $300 million of its bonds that allowed it to gain consent from its creditors, which traded on CDS, to push back its debt maturities. \n",
      "GSO and Canyon benefited from the deal because it enabled them to take over a 100 million euro ($137 million) bank loan to Codere with consent from the company’s creditors. The two debt fund managers also lent Codere 35 million euros to make its delayed coupon payment. \n",
      "Blackstone was an investor in Codere’s CDS while Canyon was not, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. GSO and Canyon declined to comment. \n",
      "Sources close to Codere’s debt talks have said bondholder debts could be cut by half in a debt-for-equity swap. \n",
      "Codere posted a 93 million euro loss for the first nine months of 2013. Its core profit of 172.3 million euros, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), was down nearly 27 percent from the year before. ($1 = 0.7322 euro) \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "Shares in Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc rise 4 percent after UBS upgrades the company’s stock to “buy” from “neutral”, as it expects the drugmaker to benefit from a weaker Japanese yen and to continue to profit from sales of doxycycline - an antibiotic to treat malaria. \n",
      "The brokerage said that, even factoring in a dip in doxycycline sales and a 40 percent fall in the drug’s price in 2014, it expects Hikma to report earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from sales of the drug in excess of $50 million. \n",
      "“We believe this assumes a conservative scenario and consequently see upside risk to this 2014 EPS (earnings per share),” UBS analysts write. \n",
      "The company had enjoyed soaring sales of doxycycline due to shortage of the drug in the United States, allowing it to raise its full-year forecast three times in 2013. \n",

      "Snowden 'justified,' deserves lighter punishment -NYT editorial\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. government should grant former NSA contractor Edward Snowden clemency or a plea bargain given the public value of revelations over the National Security Agency’s vast spying programs, the New York Times editorial board said on Thursday. \n",
      "In its lead editorial, the newspaper said Americans now more fully understand how widely their phone calls, emails and other information are tracked. Information provided to journalists by Snowden has also prompted needed legal review of the intelligence gathering and led a presidential panel to call for a major overhaul of the agency, it said. \n",
      "“Considering the enormous value of the information he has revealed, and the abuses he has exposed, Mr. Snowden deserves better than a life of permanent exile, fear and flight. He may have committed a crime to do so, but he has done his country a great service,” the New York Times’ editorial board wrote. \n",
      "The Guardian, a British newspaper that along with The Washington Post received Snowden’s leaked documents, also called for President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden in its own editorial published on Wednesday. \n",
      "“We hope that calm heads within the present administration are working on a strategy to allow Mr Snowden to return to the U.S. with dignity, and the president to use his executive powers to treat him humanely and in a manner that would be a shining example about the value of whistleblowers and of free speech itself,” The Guardian wrote. \n",
      "Snowden, living in Russia with temporary asylum, last year leaked documents he collected while working for the NSA. The United States has charged him with espionage, and more charges could follow. \n",
      "The disclosures have sparked a debate over how much leeway to give the U.S. government in gathering information to protect  Americans from terrorism, and have prompted numerous lawsuits. \n",
      "Last week, a federal judge ruled that the NSA’s collection of phone call records is lawful, while another judge earlier in December questioned the program’s constitutionality. The issue is now more likely to move before the U.S. Supreme Court. \n",
      "Snowden’s Russian amnesty is due to expire in August. He could face at least 30 years in prison over current charges but is more likely to face up to life in prison, the Times said. \n",
      "NSA’s incoming deputy director, Rick Ledgett, recently told CBS News he would favor negotiating an amnesty with Snowden in exchange for securing the documents in his possession, but the White House has dismissed that suggestion. \n",
      "The New York Times editorial board said Snowden “was clearly justified” in his leaks given that current whistleblower laws do not cover private contractors. \n",
      "The editorial listed several ways the NSA had violated the public trust, saying it broke federal privacy laws “thousands of times a year,” undermined the Internet’s basic encryption system and breached the communications links of data centers around the world. \n",
      "Obama, who has called on Snowden to return to the United States, should instead give him “an incentive to return home,” it said. \n",
      "“When someone reveals that government officials have routinely and deliberately broken the law, that person should not face life in prison at the hands of the same government,” the newspaper wrote.   (Reporting by Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending rose to its highest level in nearly five years in November as a surge in private construction projects offset a drop in public outlays. \n",
      "Construction spending increased 1 percent to an annual rate of $934.4 billion, the highest level since March 2009, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. It was the eighth straight month that construction spending increased. \n",
      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected a gain of 0.6 percent in November. Construction spending in October was revised to show a 0.9 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent increase. \n",
      "The report added to data ranging from employment to consumer spending that have suggested resilience in the economy even as growth is expected to step down from the third-quarter’s brisk 4.1 percent annual rate. \n",
      "Construction spending in November was lifted by a jump in private construction projects to their highest level since December 2008. Private construction spending rose 2.2 percent after being flat in October. \n",
      "The increase reflected strong gains in spending on both residential and nonresidential projects. Private residential spending hit its highest level since June 2008 and outlays on nonresidential structures, which include factories and gas pipelines, touched an 11-month high. \n",

      "By Neha Alawadhi and Aurindom Mukherjee \n",
      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc  said it settled a lawsuit with retailer Macy’s Inc  over a home products deal with department store J.C. Penney Co Inc. \n",
      "Martha Stewart did not disclose the terms of the settlement, but said the deal would not be material to the company. \n",
      "Macy’s sued Martha Stewart and Penney in 2012 after the two announced a partnership in 2011 to open Martha Stewart home shops at hundreds of Penney stores. \n",
      "Martha Stewart’s shares rose as much as 12 percent to more than a year high in regular trading on Thursday. The company’s stock has lost about 5 percent of its value since Macy’s filed the lawsuit in January 2012. \n",
      "“The Macy’s lawsuit was an overhang to the Martha Stewart shares; the resolution now allows the company to focus on its reorganization in its publishing division, a key catalyst toward higher stock valuations,” Noble Financial Capital Markets analyst Michael Kupinski said. \n",
      "Kupinski estimates revenue of more than $100 million for Martha Stewart from its Penney deal, which will end in 2017. \n",
      "In December 2011, Martha Stewart struck a deal with Penney under which Stewart would design kitchen, bed and bath products to be sold in shops-within-a-store at larger Penney stores that would anchor a reinvention of the department store by then CEO Ron Johnson. \n",
      "Penney and Martha Stewart revised their agreement in October, eliminating cookware, bedding and bath products, and other merchandise to which Macy’s claims exclusive rights under a 2006 deal. Penney also gave up its 17 percent stake in Stewart’s company. \n",
      "With its broadcast and publishing revenues falling, Martha Stewart has been focusing on boosting its merchandise business. \n",
      "The company’s merchandise revenue grew 7 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30. \n",
      "The business accounted for about 42 percent of Martha Stewart’s total revenue in the quarter, up from about 30 percent a year earlier. \n",
      "Macy’s also sought to stop Penney from selling any products designed by home improvement doyenne Martha Stewart even if her name doesn’t appear on the items or their marketing. \n",
      "Macy’s said in a separate statement that the Thursday settlement did not affect its outstanding claim against Penney. \n",
      "Martha Stewart’s shares closed up 9 percent at $4.57 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Penney shares closed 3 percent lower at $8.88. Macy’s shares ended flat at $53.39.\n",

      "Daughter sees foul play in death of Palestinian envoy\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "PRAGUE/GAZA (Reuters) - The Palestinian envoy to Prague was ‘deliberately killed’, his daughter alleged on Thursday, a day after he died in a mysterious explosion after opening a safe in his residence. \n",
      "Czech police said the blast that killed ambassador Jamal al-Jamal might have been caused by mishandling an explosive securing the safe. They said they were not treating it as an attack or a terrorist incident. \n",
      "In a further twist, investigators found unlicensed weapons at the Palestinian diplomatic mission, and the Czech foreign ministry said it would demand an explanation. \n",
      "Jamal suffered lethal injuries to his head, chest and abdomen in the explosion on New Year’s Day. His daughter Rana al-Jamal, 30, told Reuters: “We believe my father was killed and that his death was something arranged and not an accident. How? We do not know and that is what we want to know.” \n",
      "Jamal had been in Prague only since October but had previously served at the mission for two decades from the mid-1980s, the daughter said. He had used the safe during that period and it remained in Prague when he left, she added by telephone from Ramallah in the West Bank. \n",
      "The Palestinian mission is in the process of moving into a new embassy and residence, which share the same compound. Jamal was killed at the new residence. \n",
      "“The safe was emptied and moved to the house. My father had been putting documents inside it and it was open,” Rana al-Jamal said. “The explosion took place while he used it.” \n",
      "She said her mother, who was there at the time, had told her the safe had not been badly damaged. \n",
      "Nabil el-Fahel, a spokesman for the Palestinian mission, said the safe was being used on a daily basis to store cash. \n",
      "Some safes can be fitted with small charges to destroy secret documents in the event of the lock being tampered with. \n",
      "But Fahel said embassy staff were not aware that any explosive mechanism was attached to the safe that Jamal opened. \n",
      "Prague police chief Martin Vondrasek told Czech Radio that investigators had found weapons at the mission that were not registered with local authorities. He did not reveal the quantity and type. \n",
      "A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the mission’s staff had submitted the arms to the Czech authorities. He did not elaborate on the type of weapons involved, but said they had been retrieved from an old sack and had been untouched since Cold War times. \n",
      "The Czech foreign ministry said it was concerned by the discovery. It said diplomats’ weapons were subject to local laws on arms, which require registration and licensing. \n",
      "“The ministry is concerned that among evidence... were weapons not registered in the Czech Republic,” the ministry said in a statement. \n",
      "“In such case, the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations may have been breached and we will demand an explanation,” it added, referring to the international rules that govern the activities of diplomats and embassies. \n",

      "Taiwan's Ma says ending China standoff a must for the economy\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Ending Taiwan’s political standoff with mainland China is necessary to boost Taiwan’s sagging economy and to help it integrate more effectively with the region, the island’s president, Ma Ying-jeou, said. \n",
      "China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. Economic ties, however, have grown considerably in recent years, especially since Ma took office in 2008. \n",
      "In October, Chinese President Xi Jinping said a political solution to the standoff could not be postponed forever. But Ma later said he saw no urgency for political talks and wanted to focus on trade. \n",
      "“I fully understand that if the Taiwan economy is to expand further, we need to end the cross-strait standoff,” Ma was quoted as saying in a statement posted on the Presidential Office’s website. \n",
      "The statement did not explain what concrete steps would be taken to end an impasse that has existed since Chiang Kai-shek and his ruling Nationalist Party fled from the mainland to Taiwan at the end of China’s civil war in 1949. \n",
      "Ma opened Taiwan to trade with China when he took office in 2008 and they have since signed economic agreements that have made mainland China Taiwan’s largest trading partner. \n",
      "But booming trade has not led to progress on political reconciliation or a lessening of military readiness on both sides. \n",
      "Taiwan’s export-driven economy has been hit by slower global growth, particularly by slack demand in China. The central bank left its policy rate steady for a 10th straight quarter last month to support the economy. \n",
      "Taiwan hopes to join a trade pact between a dozen countries around the Pacific Rim known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \n",
      "But Taiwan’s integration into international groups can be complicated by its standoff with China, with other countries withholding official recognition of Taiwan because they are reluctant to anger China, which insists on a one-China policy. \n",
      "The U.S.-backed trade deal aims to establish a free-trade bloc stretching from Vietnam to Chile and Japan, encompassing about 800 million people and almost 40 percent of the global economy. \n",
      "China said in May it would study the possibility of joining talks on the pact but it has said little about it since. \n",
      "Despite the close economic ties between China and Taiwan, U.S.-armed and backed Taiwan remains a potential flashpoint and a priority for China’s ruling Communist Party, which is investing billions in defense modernization. \n",

      "Turkish military seeks review of coup plot convictions\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey’s military said on Thursday it had filed a criminal complaint over court cases involving members of the armed forces, a move which could pave the way for the retrial of hundreds of officers convicted on coup plot charges. \n",
      "Turkey’s appeals court in October upheld the convictions of top retired officers for leading a plot to overthrow Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan’s government a decade ago, a case which underlined civilian dominance over a once all-powerful army. \n",
      "The complaint comes as Erdogan’s government is weakened by a wide-ranging corruption investigation which has led to the resignation of three members of his cabinet and highlighted concern about the independence of the judiciary. \n",
      "The Hurriyet newspaper said the military’s complaint argued that evidence in the cases against serving and retired officers had been fabricated. A spokesman for the military’s General Staff confirmed that an official complaint had been sent to the Ankara prosecutor’s office but gave no further details. \n",
      "“If the complaint is accepted, a retrial will be a certainty,” said Haluk Peksen, one of the defense lawyers in the trial of more than 300 officers sentenced in 2012 over the “Sledgehammer” conspiracy, said to have included plans to bomb Istanbul mosques and trigger an army takeover. \n",
      "Erdogan has cast the corruption scandal which erupted last month as a foreign-backed plot to undermine him, and has responded by purging some 70 police officers connected with the inquiry and blocking a second investigation into major infrastructure projects. \n",
      "The military’s move comes just over a week after Erdogan’s top political adviser, Yalcin Akdogan, stirred controversy by suggesting that the government and armed forces had both been victims of similar conspiracies involving the judiciary. \n",
      "“Those who plot against their own country’s national army ... and a civil administration which has won its way into the people’s heart, know very well they are not doing something for the good of this country,” Akdogan wrote in a column in the Star newspaper on December 24. \n",
      "Erdogan’s backers accuse Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Turkish cleric with strong influence in the police and judiciary and a former ally of the prime minister, of connivance in the corruption investigations. Gulen denies the allegation. \n",
      "Erdogan’s Islamist-rooted AK Party is widely held to have relied on Gulen’s influence in breaking the power of the army - which carried out three coups between 1960 and 1980 and forced an Islamist-led government from power in 1997 - including by pursuing suspected coup plotters through the courts. \n",
      "Defense lawyers for army officers saw Akdogan’s comments as an admission that their clients had been victims of a conspiracy and have called for a retrial. Akdogan later said his comments had been misconstrued and did not refer to any specific trial. \n",

      "Malaysia's Islamic authorities seize Bibles as Allah row deepens\n",
      "An Error has occured\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Islamic authorities in Malaysia on Thursday seized 321 Bibles from a Christian group because they used the word Allah to refer to God, signalling growing intolerance that may inflame ethnic and religious tension in the Southeast Asian country. \n",
      "The raid comes after a Malaysian court in October ruled that the Arabic word was exclusive to Muslims, most of whom are ethnic Malays, the largest ethnic group in the country alongside sizeable Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities. \n",
      "That ruling overturned a court decision that allowed a Roman Catholic newspaper printed in Malay, the country’s national language, to use Allah. \n",
      "The change has heightened concern that religious authorities, which issue rulings for Muslims and operate alongside civil courts, now have more legal muscle. \n",
      "Analysts say new rulings that affect non-Muslims could be a way of deflecting anger against Prime Minister Najib Razak’s government from poor Malay Muslims over subsidy cuts likely to force up electricity, petrol and sugar prices. \n",
      "On Thursday, the top Islamic authority in the richest and most populous state of Selangor, seized the Malay-language Bibles from the Bible Society. The society said authority officials escorted two of its officials to a police station to make statements after which they were released on bail. \n",
      "“We were told that we were under investigation for breaking a Selangor state law banning non-Muslims from using the word Allah,” said Bible Society of Malaysia Chairman Lee Min Choon. \n",

      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending rose to its highest level in nearly five years in November as a surge in private construction projects offset a drop in public outlays. \n",
      "Construction spending increased 1 percent to an annual rate of $934.4 billion, the highest level since March 2009, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. It was the eighth straight month that construction spending increased. \n",
      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected a gain of 0.6 percent in November. Construction spending in October was revised to show a 0.9 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent increase. \n",
      "The report added to data ranging from employment to consumer spending that have suggested resilience in the economy even as growth is expected to step down from the third-quarter’s brisk 4.1 percent annual rate. \n",
      "Construction spending in November was lifted by a jump in private construction projects to their highest level since December 2008. Private construction spending rose 2.2 percent after being flat in October. \n",
      "The increase reflected strong gains in spending on both residential and nonresidential projects. Private residential spending hit its highest level since June 2008 and outlays on nonresidential structures, which include factories and gas pipelines, touched an 11-month high. \n",
      "Public construction spending fell 1.8 percent as both outlays on federal and state and local government projects declined.\n",

      "Preview: Sabres at Wild\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "The Minnesota Wild have lost six consecutive games in regulation for the first time in franchise history but hope to end the slide against the league’s worst road team when they host the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday. The Wild are 5-12-1 in their last 18 games and questions continue to swirl around the status of coach Mike Yeo. Minnesota’s Jason Pominville said a switch behind the bench “is not going to change anything. We have to dig deep and find a way to get ourselves out of this.” \n",
      "The league-worst Sabres have gone nearly two months since their last win on the road - a 5-4 shootout victory at Anaheim on Nov. 5. - and are 0-8-2 in their last 10 away from home, including Tuesday’s 3-0 defeat in Winnipeg. Still, Buffalo is showing signs of turning the corner with points in seven of its last 10 overall games under coach Ted Nolan. “There’s lots of room for improvement, but we’re moving in the right direction,” center Tyler Ennis said. “We’re looking forward to a really good 2014.” \n",
      "TV: 8 p.m. ET, MSG (Buffalo), FSN North (Minnesota) \n",
      "ABOUT THE SABRES (11-25-4): Ryan Miller got his 2014 off to a memorable start as he was named to the United States Olympic Team on Wednesday. Miller is 4-0-1 in his last five games and coming off a superb 49-save performance against Washington on Sunday that helped him earn the league’s Second Star of the Week honor. Cody Hodgson (thumb/wrist), who has missed the last five games, was placed on injured reserve Wednesday and the Sabres recalled forward Johan Larsson and defenseman Brayden McNabb from Rochester of the American Hockey League. \n",
      "ABOUT THE WILD (20-17-5): Yeo addressed the speculation surrounding his future with his players at practice on Wednesday before deciding to shake up the lineup, shuffling all four of his lines in an effort to provide a spark for the team. “We’re throwing a lot of stuff at the wall and we need something to stick,” said Yeo, who elevated Dany Heatley and Pominville to the top unit along with captain Mikko Koivu. Defenseman Ryan Suter has points in nine of 10 games and has scored in his last two following a 50-game drought. \n",
      "1. Suter and injured F Zach Parise (foot) were also named to the U.S. Olympic team. \n",
      "2. Buffalo has only one regulation win away from home this season - at Florida on Oct. 25. \n",
      "3. The Wild have not lost seven straight since an 0-5-2 skid in February 2012. \n",

      "* Chinese factory data puts pressure on mining sector \n",
      "* FTSE’s medium-term technical outlook seen positive \n",
      "By Atul Prakash \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index fell on the first trading day of the new year after posting its best annual gain in four years in 2013, as miners were hit by disappointing Chinese factory data. \n",
      "The FTSE mining index fell 0.9 percent on Thursday after a purchasing managers’ survey showed that factory activity in China, the world’s biggest consumer of metals, slowed in December. \n",
      "BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Anglo American  declined between 0.9 and 2.1 percent, putting pressure on the FTSE 100, which ended 0.5 percent lower at 6,717.91 points. Trading volumes were 73 percent of their 90-day daily average. \n",
      "“Miners are continuing to see selling pressure on the back of weakening manufacturing data coming out from China,” Mike Jarman, chief market strategist at H2O Markets, said. \n",
      "“But notably, the manufacturing numbers were weakened by a slowing demand for exports, which is going to remain subdued for the year as China refocuses its efforts on domestic consumption rather than an export-driven economy.” \n",
      "He said miners still offered value, especially given the sector’s under-performance compared with the broader index last year, as Chinese economic growth was expected to accelerate back towards 8 percent annually. \n",
      "The UK mining sector fell 16 percent last year, against a gain of more than 14 percent for the blue-chip FTSE 100 index,  its best annual gain since 2009. \n",
      "“The mining sector was loveless last year, and if you don’t get enough metals demand from markets like China and the United States, you might see the FTSE not getting much higher than it is already,” David Battersby, investment manager at Redmayne-Bentley, said. \n",
      "“However, in the near term, I would be on the upside for the market. I like those sectors which provide yield, such as infrastructure and financials.” \n",
      "According to Coutts, the UK offers a total dividend yield of 3.7 percent, against 3 percent in Europe, with dividend sustainability looking strong in the consumer discretionary, healthcare, industrial and energy sectors. \n",
      "Peter Botham, chief investment officer at Brown Shipley, said the FTSE 100 would continue to rise this year and would eventually break through the 7,000 level, a record high. But he expects overall returns for investors to be lower in 2014 than in 2013. \n",
      "Chartists were positive on the market’s outlook in the coming months. \n",
      "“The monthly candlestick chart shows that the UK index is back at levels that have been reached twice over the last 14 years,” Bill McNamara, a technical analyst at Charles Stanley, said in a note. \n",
      "He said that charts painted a bullish picture for the market at this point, although the upside limit in the first quarter appeared to be around 7,100, after which the index could become vulnerable to a pullback.\n",

      "Perion eyes $1 billion in revenue, more acquisitions in next five years\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Perion Network Ltd said it was targeting annual revenue of $1 billion in the next five years following the acquisition of Conduit Ltd’s ClientConnect business. \n",
      "Israel-based Perion on Thursday completed the purchase in an all-stock deal worth $660 million, giving the company a platform designed to give mobile application (app) publishers and developers a way of improving their distribution and money-making capabilities. \n",
      "Josef Mandelbaum, Perion’s chief executive, said about a quarter of mobile apps never get downloaded - except perhaps by the developer’s friends and family - while 98 percent of apps earn less than $5,000 a year. \n",
      "Citing studies, Perion also said 76 percent of consumers find free versions of apps sufficient. \n",
      "“The toughest thing is getting traffic and making money,” Mandelbaum said in an interview with Reuters. \n",
      "Perion shares, which rose 35 percent in 2013 on top of a 126 percent advance in 2012, were up 3 percent by 1120 ET on Nasdaq. \n",
      "Mandelbaum said the acquisition of the much larger ClientConnect would allow Perion to help more mobile apps find paying customers. Perion, he noted, was able to make money from its main products - IncrediMail and Smilebox - through search partnerships with Yahoo! Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp’s Bing. \n",
      "“My plan three years ago was to build a billion dollar company in Israel,” said Mandelbaum. “My internal goal is it will take three to five years to get there.” \n",
      "On its own, Perion - founded in 2000 and whose key shareholders include Benchmark Capital and JP Morgan Chase - is expected to post 2013 revenue of between $102 and $104 million, up from $61 million in 2012. Including ClientConnect, 2013 revenue would be about $400 million. \n",
      "Mandelbaum declined to give an outlook for 2014 but said the company expects to grow sales and profit, especially as the ClientConnect deal is immediately positive for earnings. \n",
      "“This deal is a great stepping stone,” Mandelbaum said. “We are not where we want to be yet. We have to do more investments and acquisitions to fill in the gaps.” \n",

      "By Andrew Callus \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell’s new boss Ben van Beurden will be able to point to a clear downward trend in spending this year, thanks in part to the way the oil company is accounting for an acquisition completed this week. \n",
      "In a deal announced on Thursday just 24 hours after the former head of refining and marketing took over officially as chief executive, Shell completed the acquisition of liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets from Spain’s Repsol. \n",
      "Shell will burden its 2013 accounts with most of the cost, helping van Buerden commit to significantly lower spending from this year - something Shell’s shareholders are very keen to see happen given that any budget strains can only dim the outlook for dividends. \n",
      "Shell and its peers in the industry are facing increasing investor pressure to keep a lid on spending as costs rise and prospects for oil prices wane. \n",
      "Shell said it would pay a net $3.8 billion to buy Repsol’s LNG portfolio outside North America and take on $1.6 billion of associated debt. \n",
      "The debt, which does not count as investment spending, becomes part of the balance sheet in 2014, and some $400 million of the actual payment will count as spending this year. The bulk of the transaction cost - some $3.4 billion - is being loaded onto the 2013 spending budget. \n",
      "Shell had originally planned to complete the deal in 2013, and in its Oct. 30 third-quarter results conference with analysts, finance director Simon Henry forecast net investment spending for the whole year - including the Repsol transaction - of some $45 billion. \n",
      "That was up from guidance of $40 billion given in the second quarter as a result of the timings of some other acquisitions and divestments. \n",
      "Shell has pledged a four-year net investment spend of $130 billion for 2012 to 2015, based on a $100 oil price scenario. \n",
      "Including $30 billion spent in 2012, if 2013 spending now comes in on track, the company will have eaten through $75 billion in the first two years - leaving only $55 billion to spend in 2014 and 2015. \n",
      "Henry flagged in October that 2013 would be “a clear peak year” for net investments, with divestments stepping up “significantly” in 2014 and 2015. \n",
      "Since van Beurden began working alongside outgoing boss Peter Voser at the beginning of the fourth quarter, the company has cancelled plans to build a gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant in the United States. \n",
      "Industry sources have said its Arrow coal bed methane LNG export project in Queensland is another likely casualty of a tighter spending regime. \n",
      "And bankers are speculating that Shell’s 23.1 percent stake in Australian group Woodside Petroleum - worth over $6 billion at current prices - will be among the divestments that Henry flagged. \n",
      "A Shell spokeswoman said the accounting had been split because a part of the transaction was done in the 2013 calendar year, and it “involved a number of legal entities in various locations and hence requires several steps to complete.” \n",
      "Projects like Arrow and the GTL plant are considered as “organic” spending - unlike the Repsol acquisition and any divestment of Woodside. \n",
      "And looking behind the headline figures, analysts say it is organic spending that investors are most concerned about, since these are the areas where cost inflation, project delays and other factors can blow strategy off course. \n",
      "Shell has no four-year target for organic spending, but Henry estimated 2013 organic spending at $36 billion. He said this part of the total was “not going to go down rapidly because that would be the best way to destroy value in our portfolio.” \n",
      "Van Beurden will face investors on Jan. 30 as the company reports fourth-quarter results, and on March 13 at a planned  investor day. \n",
      "In a separate announcement on Thursday, Shell revealed that Voser, who surprised investors last year with news of his early retirement, will be repatriated to his native Switzerland, where he will work for the local subsidiary on his full group chief executive pay and with a full pro-rata bonus. \n",
      "Voser’s retirement was announced on May 2, when Shell said he would step down “in the first half”. \n",
      "Van Beurden’s appointment came on July 9 - at which point it was announced that the Dutchman would take over on Jan. 1 and that Voser would leave the company at the end of March.\n",

      "South Sudan army advances on rebel towns before peace talks\n",
      "\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "JUBA/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - South Sudan’s army (SPLA) said it was advancing on two rebel-controlled towns on Thursday as both sides gathered in Ethiopia for peace talks to end three weeks of violence that has pushed the world’s youngest nation towards civil war. \n",
      "Both sides have agreed in principle to a ceasefire but neither has indicated when the fighting, which has killed more than 1,000 people and displaced nearly 200,000, will stop. \n",
      "South Sudanese President Salva Kiir declared a state of emergency late on Wednesday in Unity state and Jonglei, whose respective provincial capitals of Bentiu and Bor are in the hands of militia loyal to former vice president Riek Machar. \n",
      "A rebel spokesman in Unity dismissed the SPLA’s comments on its advance as lies and said South Sudan’s army and the national government in the capital Juba had resorted to a “war of allegations” before peace negotiations could get underway. \n",
      "International pressure for a peace deal is mounting. Neighboring countries mediating between the two warring sides have warned that continued fighting could scupper talks. \n",
      "“We are advancing to Bor because these people want to come to Juba,” SPLA Chief of Staff James Hoth Mai told reporters in the capital. “We don’t yet have a ceasefire and we don’t want them to come and get us.” \n",
      "Bor lies 190 kilometers (118 miles) north of Juba by road. Analysts say control of Bor hands the rebels a territorial base relatively close to Juba, strengthening their negotiating hand. \n",
      "Mai said SPLA troops were also approaching Bentiu after seizing the nearby town of Mayom on Wednesday. A rebel spokesman in Bentiu said Mayom remained in rebel hands, a comment backed up by a spokesman for the United Nations mission in South Sudan. \n",
      "“As of early morning, our understanding was that Mayom was in the hands of troops belonging to Division 4 of the SPLA who have defected to Machar,” the U.N.’s Joe Contreras told Reuters. \n",
      "The clashes erupted on December 15 and quickly spread to half of the country’s 10 states, unsettling oil markets and raising fears of the conflict destabilizing an already fragile region. \n",
      "Kiir has accused his long-term political rival Machar, whom he sacked in July, of starting the fighting in a bid to seize power. The conflict has split the country along ethnic lines, between Kiir’s Dinkas and Machar’s Nuer group. \n",
      "Machar denies Kiir’s charge but he has taken to the bush and has acknowledged leading soldiers battling the government. \n",
      "Bor’s Anglican bishop, Ruben Akurdit Ngong, said bodies littered the town, where Nuer militias massacred Dinkas in an outburst of inter-ethnic fighting in 1991. \n",
      "“The town smells terribly of human corpses,” said Ngong, who fled the rebels’ advance on Bor on Sunday after prayers. \n",
      "The SPLA estimates the number of rebels in Bor at between 4,000 and 7,000. \n",
      "Mediators say the talks in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa are meant to focus on how to roll out and monitor a ceasefire. \n",
      "Asked if both sides were genuine about a ceasefire, Andrew Mace, Britain’s acting envoy to Sudan and South Sudan, said more needed to be done to demonstrate that commitment. \n",

      "Libya says protesters agree to reopen oilfield; no progress in east\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya hopes to resume production at one of its largest oilfields, El Sharara, within three days after protesters agreed to suspend their two-month stoppage, officials said on Thursday. \n",
      "Tribesmen calling for greater local power have blocked the 350,000-barrels-per-day field since the end of October, one of many disruptions that have crippled Libya’s vital oil sector. Oil prices fell below $110 a barrel on the news and were currently trading down 1.2 percent. \n",
      "But there was no sign of an end to the blockage of three oil ports in eastern Libya, with the pro-autonomy group holding them reiterating the government needed to share oil revenues with other regions of the OPEC producer. \n",
      "Libya is in turmoil as the government struggles to rein in dozens of militias that helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but kept their guns to make political and financial demands. \n",
      "The protesters agreed to suspend their strike after the government said it would listen to their demands, according to a defence ministry spokesman. \n",
      "“They agreed to lift the blockage,” the spokesman said. \n",
      "The field, located in the remote and volatile south, supplies crude to the Zawiya export terminal, unaffected by any disruption, and feeds the 120,000-bpd Zawiya refinery. \n",
      "Libya’s state National Oil Corp (NOC) hoped to resume output in three days, NOC spokesman Mohamed al-Harari said. \n",
      "“Engineers are preparing the field to restart production,” he said. \n",
      "The protesters had demanded the establishment of a local council and the granting of national identity cards for tribesmen from Tuareg minority. \n",
      "“Information out of Libya needs to be taken with some caution until confirmed by facts, but … this could bring a temporary increase in Libya production to about 600,000 barrels a day,” said oil analyst Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix in Zug. \n",
      "“Exports from Sharara would be easier to materialise if the protests are indeed lifted as the field exports from the port of Zawiya, and that port is open.” \n",
      "Militias and tribesmen have seized ports and oilfields across Libya to press for political or financial demands, cutting output to around 220,000 bpd, from 1.4 million bpd in July. Oil is the main source for the budget and for the funding of food imports. \n",
      "There was no sign of progress in the east despite the government’s announcement last month of another attempt by tribal elders to pressure an autonomy group to end the blockage of the Ras Lanuf, Es-Sider and Zuweitina ports, which accounted previously for 600,000 bpd. \n",
      "Abd-Rabbo al-Barassi, prime minister of the self-declared eastern autonomy government, said Tripoli needed to look into corruption claims and share oil wealth with other regions in Libya. \n",
      "He did not mention any talks to end the blockage, but criticized the government in an apparent response to a news conference on Wednesday in which the labor minister warned public salary payments were at risk due to the strikes. \n",
      "“How can the government use such methods. Why don’t they look into our demands,” he said, appearing on an opposition news channel from eastern Libya. \n",
      "The group is campaigning for a federal system sharing power among regions, similar to the arrangement in place before the Gaddafi era. \n",
      "“We demand that the government preserve the oil wealth,” he said. \n",
      "Western powers fear the North African country will slide into instability as the government struggles to rein in militias. \n",
      "Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said the government will act against the oil strikes but its nascent army, still in training, is too weak to tackle heavily armed protesters, analysts say. \n",

      "An Error has occured\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "By Michael Hirtzer \n",
      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Bunge North America Inc, a division of Bunge Ltd, has sold its stake in a Mississippi ethanol plant in what is likely to be the first a spate of industry deals amid uncertainty over  biofuel use in the United States, analysts said on Thursday. \n",
      "Ethanol makers are turning big profits now, but the future is cloudy with the U.S. Environmental Protection agency expected early this year to reduce the mandate to mix biofuels with  gasoline in what would be the first cut in the 2007 Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS. \n",
      "“In my view, it’s a good time to sell and reinforces Bunge’s focus on value creation,” said Ann Duigan, an analyst at JP Morgan Chase. “More deals (are) likely if RFS declines.” \n",
      "Privately held Ergon Inc purchased Bunge’s share of what had been a 2007 joint venture for a 54-million-gallon per year ethanol plant in Vicksburg, the only facility that produced corn-based ethanol in Mississippi. \n",
      "The financial terms were not disclosed, and Ergon did not say what percentage of the venture Bunge owned. \n",
      "“This transaction allows us to look at alternative feedstocks, as well as how the plant may be used for products beyond traditional ethanol production,” Don Davis, president of Ergon’s refining and marketing division, said in a statement. \n",
      "Spokesmen for Ergon and Bunge North America did not respond to requests for further comment. \n",
      "The Mississippi facility has been idled since December 2012 after the worst U.S. drought in 50 years decimated corn supplies. Industry experts said it could also produce ethanol with sugar or sorghum. \n",
      "“The ethanol sector is doing well lately, which is probably helping deals get done; valuations on plants are pretty high right now,” said Darin Friedrichs, an analyst at AgTraderTalk, citing ample U.S. corn stocks after a record large 2013 harvest and a 30 percent drop in corn prices in the past six months. \n",
      "Margins for U.S. ethanol makers rose to their highest in at least five years recently as corn prices plunged. \n",
      "But if the Obama administration moves to cut mandated biofuel use in the United States, further expansion is unlikely, even as the industry consolidates, analysts said. \n",
      "The EPA recommended reducing the biofuels mandate in November and the proposal now is under final review. For corn-based ethanol, the agency proposed to cut the mandate to about 13 billion gallons a year from around 14.4 billion. \n",
      "With the deal for the Mississippi plant, Bunge North America’s sole holdings in the U.S. biofuel industry is now a minority stake in a facility in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Bunge Ltd’s chief executive said last year that the company also planned to shed its Brazilian sugar-ethanol holdings. \n",
      "Also on Thursday, the owners of a 125-million-gallon per year plant in Rochelle, Illinois, announced that it was for sale. The facility in the northern part of Illinois started production in 2006 and is operated by GTL Resources and Illinois River Energy, according to a release.\n",

      "4 Min Read\n",
      "* Wall Street expected to see subdued start to 2014 \n",
      "* China manufacturing index dips, missing forecasts \n",
      "* European, Asian share markets soft, Nikkei still shut \n",
      "* Dollar near highest in over five years vs yen, euro falls \n",
      "* Gold bounces, talk of Chinese demand for commodities \n",
      "By Marc Jones \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - World share markets made a groggy start to 2014 on Thursday, with investors using some disappointing Chinese manufacturing data as a reason to cash in on some of last year’s gains. \n",
      "After enjoying their best run in 15 years last year, U.S. shares were expected to edge lower when trading begins. Further gains depend on stronger growth this year, and investors were looking to U.S. jobless claims and updated December PMI figures to gauge the improvement in the world’s largest economy. \n",
      "Manufacturing data from China overnight and on Wednesday proved disappointing. Equivalent data that showed euro zone manufacturing running at its fastest rate since mid-2011 were not enough to lift shares. \n",
      "The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.3 percent before the U.S. open. It had started the day at a 5 1/2- year high. Earlier declines in Asia had left MSCI’s 45-country share index down 0.5 percent. \n",
      "“We think it is a temporary blip in China, but that and also perhaps the data showing the contraction in Singapore’s economy earlier, maybe gave the market a slight scare,” said ABN Amro economist Aline Schuiling. \n",
      "Traders showed more appetite for both growth-attuned commodities and the dollar. At the same time, they trimmed their holdings of safe-haven bonds. \n",
      "Gold grabbed the limelight, climbing 1.5 percent to $1,220 an ounce. The move recouped some of the losses that made last year gold’s worst in three decades. \n",
      "The buying spilled over into silver and copper, with dealers talking of demand from Chinese traders looking to pick up commodities on the cheap. Three-month LME copper rose to its highest in seven months. \n",
      "Among major currencies, the main theme remained weakness in the yen. The euro also tumbled as the dollar flexed its muscles. \n",
      "The greenback hovered near a five-year high versus the Japanese currency at 105.30 yen, with the focus on the Federal Reserve’s gradually scaling back its bond-buying stimulus. \n",
      "The euro dropped to 143.7870 yen, having clocked gains of 26 percent in 2013 to reach a five-year peak of 145.67. Against the dollar, it saw its biggest drop since mid-November, sinking almost a euro cent to $1.3656. \n",
      "“Today is the first day where fundamentals work out again ... That’s why there is pressure on euro/dollar,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, the head of currency research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. \n",
      "Dealers suspect the euro currency got support in recent weeks from the repatriation of funds by European banks and from the euro zone’s expanding current account surplus. But a general assumption remains that rising U.S. Treasury yields will eventually lift the dollar. \n",
      "Yields on U.S. 10-year paper are up at 2 1/2-year highs of 3.03 percent. Even shorter-dated rates have been rising as improving U.S. economic data justify the Federal Reserve’s decision to scale back its asset-buying. \n",
      "A speech by outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday may offer some more guidance on the central bank’s plans. \n",
      "Prices of German Bund futures fell to their lowest since September 2013 on Thursday as investors offloaded the top-rated bonds in favour of riskier assets. \n",
      "The premium Italian and Spanish bonds offer over benchmark German Bunds also sank to its lowest since mid-2011 as their manufacturing data beat expectations in both countries. \n",
      "In oil markets, U.S. crude futures were trading 81 cents lower at $97.62 a barrel, while Brent dropped $1.25 to just below $110.00.\n",

      "LONDON (Reuters) - British department stores group House of Fraser on Thursday said a surge in online sales had helped it to its best ever Christmas trading period. \n",
      "The group, which trades from 61 stores in Britain and Ireland and has annual sales of around 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion), said like-for-like sales excluding VAT for the three weeks to December 28 rose 7.3 percent, with online sales up 57.7 percent. \n",
      "Like-for-like sales excluding VAT for the first 9 weeks of its fourth quarter were up 4.3 percent, the firm said, adding it expected to finish the year with lower net debt, which stood at 157.2 million pounds for the year to January 26, 2013. \n",

      "Preview: California at Stanford\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "Stanford hosts California in Thursday’s Pac-12 opener with both teams looking to make an early statement in this season’s conference race. Stanford’s defense was a concern after allowing 112 points in a Nov. 11 loss to BYU, but the Cardinal improved in recent weeks and recorded an impressive road win over previously unbeaten Connecticut on Dec. 18. The Golden Bears have won three of their last four, but injured guards Ricky Kreklow and Jabari Bird will both miss Thursday’s contest. \n",
      "The Cardinal has won four of their last five and appear ready for Pac-12 play after their impressive East Coast swing earlier this month, which included a 68-65 loss to Michigan. “Would I have liked to win more games? Absolutely,” coach Johnny Dawkins told reporters. “But I think the teams we played really helped us prepare for conference play.” Dawkins used the starting lineup of Chasson Randle, Anthony Brown, Josh Huestis, Dwight Powell and Stefan Nastic in all 12 nonconference games, while California has used five different lineups in its 13 games due to injuries. \n",
      "TV: 9 p.m. ET, Fox Sports 1 \n",
      "ABOUT CALIFORNIA (9-4): Kreklow is out for the next three to five weeks with a right hand injury, while Bird is expected to miss at least another week due to a sprained right ankle. With both players missing last Saturday, senior guard Jeff Powers scored a career-high 18 points on six 3-pointers off the bench in a 90-60 win over Furman. Point guard Justin Cobbs averages a team-high 14.2 points, but the key players against Stanford figure to be forwards Richard Solomon (11.3 points, 10.3 rebounds) and David Kravish, who has three double-doubles in his last nine games. \n",
      "ABOUT STANFORD (9-3): Randle is shooting 51.4 percent from the field and ranks sixth in the Pac-12 in scoring (18.7), and he’s shooting 12-for-20 from 3-point range over his last four games. Nastic has often been overshadowed by forwards Powell (14.3 points, 7.7 rebounds) and Huestis (team-high 8.2 rebounds), but the 6-11 center has averaged 17 points over his last two games. The Cardinal is looking for a bounce-back game from Brown, who has scored a total of 14 points over his last three contests after opening the season with nine straight double-digit scoring performances. \n",
      "TIP-INS \n",
      "1. Stanford has won four of the last five games against the Golden Bears at Maples Pavilion. \n",
      "2. California coach Mike Montgomery needs one win to reach 118 and tie Pete Newell as the fourth-winningest coach in school history. \n",
      "3. Powell has averaged 10.6 points and 5.8 rebounds in seven career games against California. \n",

      "BEIJING (Reuters) - China will open a high-speed rail line to the North Korean border next year, state media said on Thursday, in a sign that China remains committed to boosting trade and economic ties with the isolated, nuclear-armed state. \n",
      "The line, under construction since 2010, will run 207 km (127 miles) from Shenyang to the border city of Dandong, which faces North Korea across the Yalu River, and will shorten the train journey from 3 1/2 hours to one hour, the official Xinhua news agency said. \n",
      "As much as 80 percent of trade between China and North Korea passes through Dandong, which is near one of North Korea’s special economic zones on Hwanggumpyong island. \n",
      "China has encouraged the development of three special economic zones in North Korea, hoping to tap low labor costs and encourage the North to see the benefits of economic reform, even while publicly rebuking it over its nuclear weapons program. \n",
      "China has stepped up checks on shipments to and from North Korea following its third nuclear test last year, but has shown no sign of cutting the country off completely, lest the impoverished state collapse, bringing with it a destabilizing wave of refugees. \n",
      "While there has been little sign of progress in the new economic zones, China continues to improve infrastructure on its side of the border, including building a bridge from Dandong into North Korea. \n",

      "Preview: Wichita State at Southern Illinois\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "Seventh-ranked Wichita State has doneeverything right this season thus far, compiling a perfect recordheading into Missouri Valley Conference play. The Shockers aregetting a lot of national attention, especially after last year’s runto the Final Four. But coach Gregg Marshall shouldn’t have to worryabout getting his team fired up for its league opener Thursday,considering the last time Wichita State traveled to Carbondale, itwas on the wrong side of the score against Southern Illinois.The Salukis have struggled formuch of this season, but Southern Illinois has won two of its lastthree, with the only loss being a two-point setback at Miami (Ohio)on Sunday. It might not be a coincidence that the better play hasoccurred since coach Barry Hinson ripped his team in a postgame pressconference Dec. 17. Hinson will be back coaching the Salukis for thisgame after he missed the Miami (Ohio) game following the death of hisson-in-law. \n",
      "TV: 8:05 p.m. ET, ESPN3 \n",
      "ABOUT WICHITA STATE (13-0): It’sbeen a long time since Wichita State was ranked as high as it is inthe latest national rankings. The Shockers certainly deserve theranking, considering their unbeaten start heading into MVC play, butthey also know that the ranking is only going to bring more hype —and more determination from their upcoming opponents. “We don’treally talk about it much,” guard Ron Baker told the Wichita Eagle.”After the new year, we’ve got some big games coming up and we knowteams are going to be coming at us.” \n",
      "ABOUT SOUTHERN ILLINOIS (4-9): Aneasy way to tell what the Salukis’ chances are in a game? Check theproduction of guard Jalen Pendleton. The 6-2 sophomore is averaging19.3 points in SIU’s four wins this year, compared to 9.2 in its ninelosses, and despite his size, he gives the Salukis a lot of physicalplay on the interior. “It’s just my will to win,” Pendleton toldthe Southern Illinoisan. “I’ll do anything this team wants me to doin order for us to be successful.” \n",
      "TIP-INS \n",
      "1. Wichita State F CleanthonyEarly had his career high of 39 points in a home win over SouthernIllinois last season but had only seven points in the Shockers’ lossin Carbondale. \n",
      "2. Southern Illinois has won 12of its last 14 home conference openers, though one of those losseswas last year to Bradley. \n",
      "3. The Salukis lead the all-timeseries between these long-time conference rivals, 48-38. \n",

      "However, he said the government expected to conduct part of its domestic borrowing in 2014 in the form of its first issue of sukuk (Islamic bonds). Oman has lagged other Gulf countries in introducing Islamic finance and is now working to develop the industry.\n",

      "FEATURE-Ride service Uber, brash darling of Silicon Valley, stalks new markets\n",
      "9 Min Read\n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick knows the value of a good controversy. \n",
      "After his upstart company, which lets people summon rides at the touch of a smartphone button, provoked a flurry of social media outrage in December over pricing policies that can result in exorbitant fares, Kalanick addressed prospective New Year’s Eve customers. \n",
      "“If you absolutely need a ride between 1 and 3 a.m., Uber will be very reliable,” Kalanick said in a YouTube video. “But it will be a pricey ride, and you just have to accept that.” The company’s pricing policies can sometimes result in fares that are eight times higher than usual. \n",
      "Like the message or not, plenty of people heard it - and fewer complaints emerged about Uber’s New Year’s Eve rates. \n",
      "Kalanick has taken a similarly tough tack with regulators, local officials, taxi-company foes and emerging competitors as he moves to build Uber into a global force. \n",
      "But it will take a lot more than a popular smartphone app, a loyal Silicon Valley following and a knack for turning free-market ideology into publicity to fulfill Kalanick’s vision of a “lifestyle and logistics” company that delivers far more than rides. \n",
      "Uber has entered more than 60 markets, ranging from its hometown of San Francisco to Berlin to Tokyo. Leaked financials in December indicate that the company, which began connecting passengers with drivers of vehicles for hire about 3-1/2 years ago, is generating $200 million a year in revenue beyond what it pays to drivers. \n",
      "Investors, led by Google Inc, have given Uber around $400 million and valued it at $3.5 billion. With a service that stitches together the buzziest categories in entrepreneurship - among them mapping, smartphones, and local services - Uber is widely seen as one of the hottest properties in Silicon Valley. \n",
      "Yet Uber still faces daunting regulatory hurdles that have left it shut out of major markets such as Miami. Lawsuits, many from taxi companies, are piling up. Competitors such as Hailo, Sidecar and Lyft are coming on strong. And aside from publicity stunts involving delivery of kittens, ice cream and Christmas trees, Uber has yet to provide anything beyond rides. \n",
      "Delivery “can become an extremely complex thing,” said Kerry Rice, a digital media analyst at Needham. “It’s about the scheduling and the software and the ability to manage a fleet.” \n",
      "Delivery is currently a hot topic among Internet retailers, with companies like eBay Inc, Amazon.com Inc, and Google all experimenting with same-day shipping. But it has proven a graveyard in the past for dot-com companies, such as Webvan and Kosmo, which had dreams of challenging the global delivery leaders. \n",
      "Uber declined to comment on its plans. \n",
      "When Uber started offering its service in 2010, it was a way to connect riders with town car drivers who had extra time between scheduled gigs. The riders sign up via an app, with a portion of their fare going to Uber and a portion to the drivers, who are independent contractors. \n",
      "It developed a loyal following in the first cities where it launched - including San Francisco, New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. - in part because Uber served up rides in areas with a dearth of taxis. The rides, in black town cars, offered more pizzazz and comfort than a taxi, but without the advance-booking that limo services typically require. \n",
      "Uber also proved masterful at harnessing publicity tied to one-time events. In Boston, for example, it offered free rides along a subway line that was shut down for repairs. \n",
      "The company has adroitly tapped in to social media to rally fans, who attend mixers, lobby politicians, sign Facebook petitions and speak up at local hearings that affecting Uber. \n",
      "In 2012, the Washington D.C. city council was weighing a measure that would make Uber sedans cost five times the price of cabs - until Uber fans bombarded council members with emails and tweets. The council then passed an amendment allowing Uber to do business, generating even more publicity. \n",
      "But there have been plenty of regulatory setbacks too. In some cities, such as Miami; Austin, Texas; and Vancouver, British Columbia, local regulations keep Uber out, typically by requiring minimum fares or minimum wait periods between the time a customer requests a ride and the time that customer steps in to the car. \n",
      "In other areas where Uber already operates, lobbying by the taxi industry has resulted in efforts to change the law to shut down app-based ride services. In Seattle, the city council is considering limiting such services to 100 part-time drivers a week and requiring special licenses. \n",
      "Uber chalked up some regulatory wins during 2013, including in Dallas and Denver. But the company does not do business in one quarter of the 20 largest cities in the United States. \n",
      "The taxi industry is also fighting Uber in court. In Chicago, local cab companies have filed a federal lawsuit alleging various illegal practices by Uber, including misleading marketing and unfair competition. Boston cabbies have filed a similar case. Uber declined to comment. \n",
      "Separately, a group of California Uber drivers is seeking class status for a lawsuit alleging they get stiffed on tips and business expenses such as gasoline. \n",
      "“The allegations made against our company are entirely without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously,” an Uber spokesman said. “Our technology platform has allowed thousands of drivers to generate an independent wage and build their own small businesses.” \n",
      "Uber recently won a state court victory in Massachusetts, where the city of Cambridge unsuccessfully sued to try to overturn a state agency’s ruling that Uber could operate while federal officials evaluate the company’s technology. No precedent-setting federal cases have been decided yet. \n",
      "California provides Uber’s surest footing in regulatory terms: the state’s Public Utilities Commission gave app-based ride companies a green light in September. But in October, Uber, seeking to avoid CPUC oversight entirely, filed a petition for rehearing, arguing the body does not have jurisdiction over technology companies. \n",
      "Meanwhile, Uber is going toe to toe with competitors such as Sidecar, which allows ordinary people to provide paid rides in their own cars. Uber has launched UberX, a lower-priced service that uses mid-range cars rather than the black town cars on which it built its reputation. \n",
      "“Travis (Kalanick) is not ceding ground at any price point,” said Bill Gurley, a partner at venture-capital firm Benchmark who has backed Uber since early 2011. \n",
      "Gurley and others are betting there are enough people willing to pay a premium - even a very large one - for a reliable ride, or eventually for delivery services. One of Uber’s innovations is so-called surge pricing, under which rates go up at times of high demand or low supply of cars. \n",
      "During a recent snowstorm in New York, some Uber users tweeted photos of notices from the company that their fare would be as much as 8.5 times normal. At Sidecar, by comparison, surge pricing is also used, but it is capped at three times the normal rates, a spokeswoman said. \n",
      "Kalanick defends surge pricing as both a matter of free-market principle and as the best way to assure that people can get a ride when they really need one. \n",
      "“You’ll always be notified in BIG, BOLD print if surge pricing is in effect,” the company wrote in a Dec. 30 blog post, linking to the video of Kalanick explaining the policy. \n",
      "Many customers still perceive surge pricing as price gouging, and the policy will not endear the company to regulators. Yet even critics sometimes appear to sustain a love-hate relationship with Uber and its combative CEO. \n",
      "“You can try to rationalize it, but it won’t change the ill feelings most of us have toward your service,” a Los Angeles customer calling herself Pasta Versaucy tweeted to Kalanick on Wednesday, in reference to high New Year’s Eve rates. \n",
      "A little while later, she sent out another tweet. “Hypothetically speaking: can I order an @Uber to charter a burger to my house? Because I totally would.” \n",
      "Kalanick, who had engaged in some New Year’s Twitter banter with her and other critics, let the question go unanswered.\n",

      "\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "Minnesota has won 12 straight home games dating to last season, but Michigan hasn’t had much trouble at Williams Arena in recent years. The Wolverines shoot for their fifth straight road victory against the Golden Gophers when the teams open Big Ten play Thursday. Michigan has won four straight and eight of nine overall in the series. \n",
      "The Wolverines open the conference slate without sophomore big man Mitch McGary (9.5 points, 8.3 rebounds), who plans to have surgery to correct a nagging lower back problem that has limited his effectiveness. “I think everyone is rallying to it,” Michigan coach John Beilein told the school’s website. “Obviously, Mitch is really good friends with our team. They are playing for him just as much as they were playing with him.” The Golden Gophers have won six straight following back-to-back losses to Syracuse and Arkansas in the Maui Invitational in November. \n",
      "TV: 7 p.m. ET, Big Ten Network \n",
      "ABOUT MICHIGAN (8-4): Three of the Wolverines’ four losses are to teams ranked in the top 12 - Iowa State, Duke and No. 1 Arizona - and the four have come by a total of 21 points. Without McGary, senior Jordan Morgan and junior Jon Horford will see more time in the post, and the duo combined for 16 points and 10 rebounds in Saturday’s 88-66 victory over Holy Cross. The rest of Michigan’s outstanding sophomore class also must help pick up the slack with Nik Stauskas (18.2 points), Glenn Robinson III (14.2) and Caris LeVert (13.1) leading the way. \n",
      "ABOUT MINNESOTA (11-2): The Golden Gophers’ non-conference slate was littered with weak opponents, but they played Syracuse tough and have a quality 10-point win over Florida State on their resume. Minnesota gets most of its offensive production from the backcourt trio of Andre Hollins (16.2 points), Austin Hollins (13.5 points, 7.2 rebounds) and DeAndre Mathieu (11.5 points, 4.8 assists) and uses its pressure defense to fuel the offense. The frontcourt doesn’t contribute much scoring, but center Elliott Eliason is a solid post defender, averaging 8.2 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. \n",
      "TIP-INS \n",
      "1. Michigan is 25-0 under coach John Beilein when scoring 80 or more points, including 6-0 this season. \n",
      "2. The Golden Gophers lead the Big Ten in steals (8.8 per game) and free-throw percentage (76). \n",
      "3. Robinson is coming off a career-best 23-point effort against Holy Cross and has averaged 19.3 points over his last four games. \n",

      "(Adds details, quotes) \n",
      "By Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal \n",
      "COLOMBO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka’s economy is expected to grow 7.8 percent this year, with an inflation target of between 4-6 percent and a lower interest rate regime, the head of the island-nation’s central bank said on Thursday. \n",
      "The central bank also announced plans to merge banks and non-banking financial firms to strengthen financial stability. \n",
      "Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said Sri Lanka’s economy  expanded 7.2 percent last year, compared with 6.4 percent in 2012. \n",
      "“Now we are a $67 billion economy. We expect the economy to grow 7.8 percent this year and to gradually expand it to 8.5 percent in 2016,” Cabraal told a forum in Colombo while revealing the monetary and financial policies for 2014. \n",
      "The central bank’s policy statement seen by Reuters also showed it expected the country to reduce the trade deficit to 11.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) or $8.97 billion this year, compared with a 12.8 percent deficit last year. \n",
      "The current account deficit is also expected to improve, decreasing to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2014 from last year’s 3.9 percent. The balance of payments surplus is seen more than doubling to $1.5 billion this year from an estimated $700 million last year. \n",
      "Cabraal said the country’s tolerable range of inflation in 2014 would be between 4 percent and 6 percent and thereafter it would be between 3 percent and 5 percent until 2016. \n",
      "The central bank also expects the rupee currency to strengthen in the medium term due to improvement in capital inflows. \n",
      "“The central bank’s direct intervention in foreign exchange market will be at minimal level and only in the event there are signs of excessive fluctuation, the bank will absorb or supply foreign exchange as and when required,” Cabraal said. \n",
      "The central bank’s policy announcement came after it cut the reverse repurchase rate by 50 basis points to a multi-year low of 8 percent earlier in the day, in a move to reduce commercial banks’ interest rate spreads over time. \n",
      "The central bank hopes to reduce the current 58 non-banking financial institutions to 20 through consolidation, while new foreign banks will have to be locally incorporated from 2016. \n",
      "According to central bank data, 11 banks have a combined 89.4 percent market share, each with over 100 billion rupee worth of assets, while 12 domestic banks each with less than 100 billion rupee of assets have a 7.4 percent market share. \n",
      "“Banks with assets of less than 100 billion rupees will be expected to grow beyond 100 billion rupees through organic growth or consolidation or merger with other banks,” Cabraal said. \n",
      "Cabraal, however, said consolidation would not prevent new local or foreign banks entering into business. \n",
      "“Provided those banks can participate in our economy in a greater way, of course would not have any problem in approval. They have a level playing field.”    (Reporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - The wintry motif for an NFL postseason that climaxes next month in the first cold weather Super Bowl will have a fittingly frigid launch in this weekend’s opening NFC playoff games. \n",
      "A snowstorm sweeping through the U.S. Northeast on Friday is expected to set the scene in Philadelphia, where the NFC East champion Eagles (10-6) host the wild card New Orleans Saints (11-5) in sub-freezing conditions on Saturday.7 \n",
      "Sunday follows with NFC North winners Green Bay Packers (8-7-1) entertaining the wild card San Francisco 49ers (12-4) in temperatures that could hit zero Fahrenheit (-18 Celsius). \n",
      "The Eagles-Saints showdown holds the potential for a high-scoring clash with potent offenses directed by tried and true New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees and Philadelphia’s second-year sensation Nick Foles. \n",
      "Brees, who marched the Saints to the Super Bowl title in 2010, finished the regular season with 39 touchdown passes, 12 interceptions, and 5,162 yards, second only to Peyton Manning’s record 5,477. New Orleans ranked fourth in total offense. \n",
      "Foles threw for 27 touchdowns and two interceptions, and a league-leading passer rating of 119.2 after taking over as starter and directing the Eagles’ No. 2 ranked offense. \n",
      "Besides passes, Brees and Foles could swap high school stories as the dueling quarterbacks share even more on their resumes having both attended Westlake High in Austin, Texas. \n",
      "Brees, who at 34 is 10 years older than Foles, marveled at the job his younger counterpart has done. \n",
      "“Those are pretty impressive numbers, especially for a guy who’s in his first year as a starter,” Brees told reporters. \n",
      "“I’m very happy for his success. Not just the fact that we’re from the same high school and I kind of know the road he’s traveled. But he seems like a tremendous young man.” \n",
      "The contest will test the road readiness of the Saints, who were 8-0 in their climate-controlled Superdome home and 3-5 when playing in hostile environments. \n",
      "Philadelphia, after struggling at home, have run off four victories in a row at Lincoln Financial Field and won seven of their last eight games to snare the division crown. \n",
      "While the Saints, under new defensive coordinator Rob Ryan, ranked fourth in fewest yards allowed per game, they must deal with a balanced Eagles attack that also features the nifty running of LeSean McCoy, who led the NFL in rushing this year. \n",
      "New Orleans ranked 19th in the 32-team league defending against the run. \n",
      "Philadelphia wide receiver DeSean Jackson, who had 1,332 receiving yards this season, felt that being home could prove to be a strong advantage. \n",
      "“Our fans are going to go wild,” he said. “It’s a great opportunity to bring the playoffs to Philadelphia.” \n",

      "\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Saudi leader of an al-Qaeda spinoff group arrested in Lebanon this week was a key fundraiser in the Gulf for militants fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, official and private experts say. \n",
      "The Lebanese army arrested Muhammad al-Majid, who leads the Lebanon-based Abdullah Azzam Brigades which claimed a double suicide attack on the Iranian embassy in Beirut last November. \n",
      "That attack was part of a spiral of sectarian violence in Lebanon that appears to be a spillover from Syria’s civil war. In the latest incident, a car bomb killed at least five people in a Shi’ite Muslim stronghold in southern Beirut on Thursday. \n",
      "Laith Alkhouri of Flashpoint Partners, a private group which monitors militant websites for business and government clients, said Majid had “been behind a great deal of financing to the jihadists fighting in Syria.” \n",
      "U.S. and European officials say that the most militant Sunni factions fighting Assad’s forces, including the Nusrah Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, both aligned with al-Qaeda, are being financed largely by wealthy families in Saudi Arabia and Gulf states. \n",
      "A U.S. official who declined to be identified said Majid’s arrest was, “at least a temporary setback, but certainly not a death blow, to the Ziad al-Jarrah Battalions, one of the most powerful Sunni terrorist groups in Lebanon.” \n",
      "“Under Majid’s leadership, the group exported a degree of the sectarian carnage of the Syrian civil war to Lebanon by targeting Iranian and Hezbollah interests. At the same time, this is a faction that has demonstrated its resilience in the past, and Majid’s experienced deputies may well step up to the plate in his absence,” the official said. \n",
      "The Saudi government has made serious efforts to block fundraising for extreme Islamist Syrian rebels, U.S. officials said, but Gulf state governments have been more tolerant. \n",
      "Alkhouri said that over the last two years, fundraisers based in Kuwait, often using Kuwaiti bank accounts, have been active raising funds for anti-Assad forces using social media outlets including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Skype. \n",
      "In June 2012, Majid issued an audio message in which he criticized the Saudi government for impeding a fundraising campaign several prominent Wahhabi Muslim scholars based in the Gulf had launched in support of Syrian rebels. \n",
      "According to Alkhouri, in his audio message Majid exhorted listeners to donate funds to Syrian rebels, saying: “No one can prevent you from supporting our brothers in Syria, and each one of you can collect money from his acquaintances, relatives and women, and deliver it to those he trusts from the people of Syria and the countries surrounding it.” \n",
      "Alkhouri said Majid went on to spell out a Kuwait link, saying that for “He who does not know anyone, then in Kuwait there is good activity in gathering money for our brothers in Syria, led by known scholars and their names are declared and reaching them is easy, and anyone can travel to them.” \n",
      "In a subsequent audio recording released in August 2012, Alkhouri said, Majid had implicitly threatened Lebanese Shi’ites, whose ostensible allies, the government of Iran and the Hezbollah movement, have strongly backed Assad. \n",
      "Last year, the Azzam Brigades, named after an associate of the late Osama bin Laden, were formally designated by the U.S, State Department as a foreign terrorist organization. \n",
      "The State Department said the group was divided into two branches: one called the Yusuf al-‘Uyayri Batallions, named after a founder of Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Lebanon based Ziyad al-Jarrah Battalions, named after one of the airliner hijackers who attacked New York and Washington on September 11, 2001. \n",

      "UPDATE 1-FireEye buys cyber forensics firm Mandiant for about $1 bln\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "By Jim Finkle \n",
      "BOSTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Cybersecurity company FireEye Inc  has acquired Mandiant Corp, the computer forensics specialist best known for unveiling a secretive Chinese military unit believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks on U.S. companies. \n",
      "FirEye shares jumped more than 20 percent after Thursday’s announcement of the $1.05 billion cash-and-stock deal, which FireEye said closed on Monday. It unites two companies with relatively new technologies for thwarting cyber attacks, and brings together two of the most-respected executives in the security industry: FireEye CEO Dave DeWalt and Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia. \n",
      "While sales of older anti-virus products have been on the decline, security experts expect strong growth in both FireEye’s cloud-based systems for detecting malicious software and Mandiant’s software that analyzes cyber attacks. \n",
      "About a year ago the two companies entered into a technology development agreement that made it easier to deploy their products together. With the merger, FireEye will gain Mandiant’s team of forensics investigators. \n",
      "“They have these very strong Navy ‘cyber’ Seals who respond to breaches and are very good at what they do,” DeWalt said about Mandiant. He had previously served as chairman of Mandiant’s board. \n",
      "“My aim is to create the strongest security company in the world,” DeWalt said in an interview. \n",
      "FireEye, which has yet to post a profit, said the acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings and expects the combined company’s revenue to grow about 50 percent this year. In comparison, Symantec Corp, the biggest maker of anti-virus software, has said it expects fiscal 2014 revenue to drop 3 percent to 4 percent. \n",
      "Mandiant is best known for its forensics services. The company rose to prominence in February 2013 when it published a report detailing what it said were links between a Shanghai-based unit of the People’s Liberation Army and a long list of attacks on U.S. companies.. Beijing denied all allegations in the report. \n",
      "“If you combine FireEye’s advanced persistent threat technology with Mandiant’s endpoint protection, it really makes them a major force in the cyber-security industry,” said FBR analyst Daniel Ives. \n",
      "Mandiant, which has long been profitable, generates sales of more than $100 million a year, according to DeWalt. \n",
      "Also on Thursday, FireEye announced preliminary revenue for the fourth quarter above its previous estimate. It said fourth-quarter revenue would be between $55 million and $57 million, compared to its previous estimate of between $52 million to $54 million. \n",
      "DeWalt has declined to say when he expects the company to be profitable. \n",
      "FireEye, which has a market capitalization of around $5 billion, will pay for Mandiant with a combination of stock and cash. It issued 21.5 million shares and options, which were worth $939 million on Monday, when the stock closed at $43.69. \n",
      "A company spokesman said it had about 140 million shares outstanding after the deal was completed. \n",
      "It will also pay $106.5 million in net cash to Mandiant’s shareholders, who include Mandia as well as Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and One Equity Partners, the private investment arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co. \n",
      "Brenon Daly, M&A; research director for 451 Group, said that FireEye was paying approximately 10 times Mandiant’s annual revenue. That is about the same revenue multiple that Cisco Systems Inc paid in its $2.7 purchase of Sourcefire Inc, last year’s biggest deal in the information security industry, he said. \n",
      "“This is one of the first time we have seen one of the new high-flying IPOs use the currency generated through the IPO process to pull of this large a transaction,” Daly said. \n",
      "DeWalt said he owns some shares in Mandiant and will disclose the size of his stake within a few days through a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n",
      "FireEye shares rose 23.51 percent in extended trade after closing down 5.69 percent at $41.13 on Nasdaq. \n",
      "FireEye’s rivals include Palo Alto Networks Inc, which went public in 2012 in one of that year’s most successful IPOs. \n",
      "Mandiant was founded in 2004 by Kevin Mandia, a former U.S. Air Force cyber-forensics investigator who co-authored an influential textbook on the subject. The company made its name by automating processes used to investigate computer breaches. \n",
      "The company was largely unknown outside the computer security world until February of last year, when it fingered the People’s Liberation Army’s Shanghai-based Unit 61398 as the most likely driving force behind a Chinese hacking group known as APT1. \n",
      "Other security companies had published reports on cyberattacks, but had shied away from so clearly identifying their perpetrators. \n",
      "DeWalt said FireEye would consider releasing similar reports now that it owns Mandiant. \n",
      "“You will probably see us continue to do it when it is appropriate,” he said. “There is some incredibly egregious behavior.” \n",
      "DeWalt is the former chief executive of anti-virus software maker McAfee who sold McAfee to Intel Corp. \n",
      "Mandia was named FireEye’s chief operating officer. He said in an interview that he plans to move to Silicon Valley, where FireEye has its headquarters, from the Washington D.C. area. \n",
      "“I’m in this for the long-term,” he said. “This is as exciting as heck for me.”\n",

      "By Rodrigo Campos \n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - World equity markets kicked off 2014 with a whimper on Thursday as slightly disappointing Chinese manufacturing data triggered some profit-taking, and oil prices were lower as Libya prepared to reopen a major oilfield. \n",
      "Top U.S. stock indexes posted their largest daily drops in three weeks on the first trading day of the new year after the benchmark S&P; 500 finished its best year since 1997. \n",
      "The dollar rallied against a basket of major currencies  as jobs, housing and manufacturing data gave support to the Federal Reserve’s decision to start slowing its stimulus program this month. \n",
      "Global manufacturing ended 2013 on a strong note as major exporters like Japan, Germany and Italy posted their fastest growth in years, although manufacturing data from China overnight and on Wednesday proved disappointing. \n",
      "“There was a sequential decline in the (Chinese) PMI number, so that knocked down indexes a bit. It’s definitely taking a bit of a breather in looking for the new catalyst, looking for the next investment theme to unfold and develop,” said Anastasia Amoroso, global market strategist with J.P. Morgan Funds, in New York. \n",
      "“It’s a slow start to the new year, but it’s also important to look past one day of data points and what we think is going to be a continuation of a cyclical expansion in the United States and elsewhere.” \n",
      "The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129.7 points or 0.78 percent, to 16,446.96, the S&P; 500 lost 16.45 points or 0.89 percent, to 1,831.91 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 35.613 points or 0.85 percent, to 4,140.977. \n",
      "The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 ended down 0.8 percent after starting the day at a 5-1/2-year high. MSCI’s 45-country share index was down 1 percent. \n",
      "Crude oil prices fell after Libya prepared to restart a major oilfield and on speculation of a sharp rise in crude stockpiles in the United States. \n",
      "Brent was last down 2 percent at $108.56 a barrel while U.S. crude was last at $96.38 per barrel, down 2.1 percent. \n",
      "A report by industry group Genscape showed a 1 million barrel rise in stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the benchmark delivery point for U.S. oil futures. \n",
      "Spot gold climbed 1.5 percent to $1,223 an ounce. The move recouped some of the losses that made last year gold’s worst in three decades. \n",
      "Three-month LME copper rose to its highest level in seven months but failed to hold above resistance near $7,420 per ton. It was recently up 0.3 percent at $7,381. \n",
      "The euro, the strongest-performing major currency in 2013 but historically a weaker performer at the start of a calendar year, dropped to a two-week low of $1.3634 and last traded 0.6 percent lower at $1.3669. \n",
      "The dollar rose to its strongest level versus the yen since October 2008, hitting a high of 105.44 yen, before erasing gains to trade down 0.2 percent at 105 yen. \n",
      "Japanese financial markets are closed on Thursday and Friday for the New Year’s break. \n",
      "Against a basket of major currencies, the greenback rose 0.6 percent. \n",
      "“The U.S. dollar has started the year with strength, and a shift in market dynamics suggests the dollar may continue to gain versus the euro and other counterparts,” said David Rodriguez, quantitative strategist at DailyFX in New York. \n",

      "BRISBANE (Reuters) - Maria Sharapova rallied to beat Kaia Kanepi on Thursday and next faces Serena Williams in the Brisbane International semi-finals knowing she must dramatically improve to end a run of 13 straight defeats against her nemesis. \n",
      "World number one Williams comfortably ousted Slovakian Dominika Cibulkova 6-3 6-3 in 61 minutes, winning the first set without losing a point on serve - a feat the American had not achieved since she was a junior. \n",
      "Sharapova was involved in an error-strewn battle, coming from a set down to defeat Estonia’s Kanepi 4-6 6-3 6-2 in two hours. \n",
      "The pattern was set at the start as the match began with four successive breaks of serve. \n",
      "Had 2012 champion Kanepi been in better form, the Sharapova-Williams showdown that the tournament organizers hoped for would have been scuppered. \n",
      "The Russian improved as the match went on and in the third set her service accuracy improved to 84 percent, nearly double her efforts in the first two sets. \n",
      "“You’re going up against a great champion that’s playing great tennis at the moment,” Sharapova told reporters of her clash with Williams. “You know that you have to raise your level in order to beat her. \n",
      "“I think the intensity level of our matches are always high. I think she goes up and wants to play the best tennis against me.” \n",
      "When asked about her frosty off-court relationship with Williams, the Russian replied: “I have said everything I have to say about it”. \n",

      "* Unsolicited suitor Wanxiang allegedly contributed to bankruptcy \n",
      "* Fisker urges court to approve sale to Hong Kong’s Richard Li entity \n",
      "* Judge to consider Li, Wanxiang plans Jan. 10 \n",
      "By Tom Hals \n",
      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Fisker Automotive, the bankrupt maker of a plug-in hybrid sports car, asked a federal judge to approve its proposed sale to a Hong Kong tycoon rather than a Chinese suitor that Fisker alleged was to blame for its failure. \n",
      "A courtroom showdown is set for Jan. 10 that will determine the future of the defunct car maker, which was launched with a controversial U.S. government loan. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Kevin Gross must decide if Fisker’s business will be put to open auction or sold to an affiliate of Richard Li as the company has proposed. \n",
      "The hearing was originally scheduled for Friday, but was postponed one week as a major snowstorm threatened to disrupt travel throughout the eastern United States. \n",
      "The company’s plans were thrown into doubt on Monday, when the official creditors’ committee proposed auctioning the business and presented an initial $24.725 million bid from the U.S. unit of Wanxiang Group, China’s top auto parts company. \n",
      "Fisker attacked the creditors’ proposal in a series of court filings on Wednesday with the bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware, noting that after Wanxiang bought A123 Systems Inc, a battery maker, it cut supplies to Fisker. \n",
      "“Wanxiang now seeks to profit from a bankruptcy that it helped cause,” Fisker said in a filing. \n",
      "An attorney for the creditors’ committee disputed that, noting that Wanxiang acquired A123 months after Fisker idled its production to save cash. “Fisker was no longer producing cars at that time,” said Sunni Beville, of law firm Brown Rudnick. \n",
      "The creditors’ committee has called the Wanxiang bid proposal the best option. It also asked the bankruptcy court to allow it to sue to former Fisker director David Manion and others for improperly pushing the sale to Li. \n",
      "Hanging in the balance are the assets of a company once touted as America’s “green” rival to prestigious brands such as Maserati, but that has not made its signature Karma vehicle in more than a year. \n",
      "The company obtained a $529 million loan from the Department of Energy that was meant to promote fuel-efficient cars, which in turn helped to lure private backing. \n",
      "Fisker raised more than $1.4 billion in public and private funds after its founding in 2007. But lavish spending, quality and engineering blunders and other mistakes drained the company’s coffers and delayed the launch of the Karma, several people close to the company told Reuters earlier this year. \n",
      "An entity affiliated with Li planned to buy Fisker after he paid $25 million for Fisker’s government loan, outbidding Wanxiang. Instead of using cash, the Li affiliate planned to buy Fisker’s assets using a “credit bid” of a portion of what Fisker owed on that loan, leaving other creditors with next to nothing. \n",
      "Court records show that a majority of unsecured creditors such as design consultants and suppliers voted to reject the plan to sell Fisker to Li. \n",
      "The case is In re Fisker Automotive Holdings Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 13-13087.\n",

      "PHOENIX — Most opponents cannot keep up with Phoenix Suns. \n",

      "Slowing the game at times to a wagon-train pace, Memphis topped the previously sizzling Suns 99-91 Thursday at US Airways Arena. \n",
      "The Grizzlies (14-17) also whipped the Suns in Memphis on Dec. 3. Other than the two losses to the Grizzlies, the Suns lost only two other games over the past month. \n",
      "Forward Zach Randolph led the Grizzlies with 20 points and 15 rebounds. \n",
      "Suns guard Goran Dragic scored a career-high 33 points and added seven assists. \n",
      "“Memphis is not a good matchup for us,” Dragic said. “They have a lot of big guys under the rim, and they attack the paint.” \n",
      "The Suns (19-12) played without guard Eric Bledsoe, who was a late scratch because of a right knee sprain. Gerald Green started in his place and scored nine points. \n",
      "The lineup change took away the Suns’ chief advantage: the ability to play their dual-point-guard backcourt of Bledsoe and Dragic. \n",
      "Grizzlies guard Mike Conley, noting the battle of wills in establishing the teams’ preferred tempos, said, “It’s tough to play at that pace. They practice that way. They play that way. It’s not our style.” \n",
      "The Grizzlies shut down the Suns’ 3-point game (Phoenix shot just 8-for-30 from long range) while running up a monstrous 54-15 advantage in bench scoring. Memphis got key contributions from forward Ed Davis (8-for-11 for 16 points, plus 11 rebounds) and guard Jerryd Bayless (17 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter). \n",
      "The Grizzlies ran up a 57-44 lead early in the third quarter. The Suns then took off on an 18-0 run thanks to a series of driving layups, steals fast breaks, a spurt led by Dragic and forward P.J. Tucker. \n",
      "The surge gave the Suns a 62-57 lead, and they held a 73-69 advantage heading into the final quarter. \n",
      "“We knew they’d make a run,” Davis said. “We just had to withstand it and make a last push.” \n",
      "They did just that. \n",
      "The Grizzlies went on a 13-2 run to start the fourth, capped by a whirling fast-break layup by Davis that gave them an 82-75 lead. Moments later, Bayless nailed a 3-pointer to give Memphis a 94-84 lead. The Suns never threatened again. \n",
      "Bayless, who played in high school just a couple of miles from the Suns’ arena, joked, “A fan said that I had disgraced St. Mary’s (High School). That hurt my feelings. That got me going a little.” \n",
      "Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger said, “They ran downhill on us....But I thought our guys showed a lot of character ... after taking a serious punch ... (and got) a very impressive win on the road.” \n",
      "After the Suns took a 26-22 lead after the first quarter, the Grizzlies battered the Suns in the paint and took a 53-41 halftime lead. Thirty-eight of the Grizzlies’ first-half points came in the paint. Meanwhile, the Suns were misfiring from long range, shooting just 2-for-11 on 3-pointers in the first half. \n",
      "NOTES: After the Suns went 10-3 in December, the NBA selected Jeff Hornacek as the Western Conference’s coach of the month. “I take it as a team award,” Hornacek said. He became the first person to win coach and player honors for the same franchise. He was named player of the month for the Suns in December 1991. ... The Grizzlies defeated the Suns 110-91 on Dec. 3 in Phoenix. That sent the Suns to a season-worst 9-9. Phoenix won 10 of its next 13 games. ... The Suns came into the game 28-7 all-time vs. the Grizzlies in Phoenix, their best home winning percentage (.800) against any opponent. ... The Grizzlies acknowledge they are different than many teams in the generally high-scoring, up-tempo West. “We are kind of the knuckleball,” coach Dave Joerger said. “We are built differently. We have to try to play from a lead.” ... The Grizzlies continue to play without injured C Marc Gasol.\n",

      "Parents may want to limit electronic media at mealtime\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Parents who let their teens use electronic devices or watch TV during family meals tend to serve less nutritious food and have poorer family communication, a new study suggests. \n",
      "Experts have suggested turning the TV off at mealtime for years. But with the advent of cell phones and other handheld devices, kids can bring all kinds of media with them to the table. \n",
      "“The findings of this most recent paper showed that mealtime media use is common among families with adolescents but that setting rules around media use at meals may reduce media use among teens and have other positive benefits as well,” lead author Jayne A. Fulkerson told Reuters Health in an email. \n",
      "Fulkerson is the director of the Center for Child and Family Health Promotion Research at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing in Minneapolis. \n",
      "“Parents who are having family meals with media could choose to make some rules excluding media at mealtimes to spend more quality time with their children,” she said. \n",
      "Fulkerson and her colleagues asked more than 1,800 parents how often their adolescent children watched TV, talked on the phone, texted, played games or listened to music with headphones during family meals. \n",
      "They also asked parents if they set rules on media use at mealtime and whether they felt family meals were important. Children answered questions about how well their families communicated, including how often they talked about problems with their parents. \n",
      "Two thirds of parents reported that their teens watched TV or movies during family meals at least some of the time. One quarter said the TV was on frequently. \n",
      "Texting, talking on the phone, listening to music with headphones and using handheld games were less common. Between 18 and 28 percent of parents reported those activities happened at mealtime, according to findings published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \n",
      "Close to three quarters of parents said they set limits on mealtime media use. \n",
      "Girls were more likely to use electronic media than boys and media use at mealtime increased with age. It was also more common among families with parents who were less educated or were black or Asian. \n",
      "Mealtime media use was less common when parents set rules, but more common among families that didn’t communicate much. \n",
      "Parents who reported frequent media use also said their families had fewer servings of green salad, fruit, vegetables, 100-percent juice and milk at meals, and more sugar-sweetened beverages. \n",
      "The researchers didn’t ask if parents also used electronic media at mealtime. \n",
      "“What parents told us is that kids (and probably parents alike) are texting and using games while eating dinner. In several surveys I have done with parents and youth, they have indicated that there is a lot of multitasking going on,” Fulkerson said. \n",
      "She said research has shown frequent family meals are tied to higher self-esteem and a better diet among kids. \n",
      "Given the opportunity, most children will talk about themselves and their lives at mealtime, leading to better family communication, Fulkerson said. \n",
      "“Perhaps they will have greater feelings of connectedness as well. Mealtimes are a great venue for this. Of course, it is not true for every family, but fits for many,” she said. \n",
      "“There is no magic number of how many (family meals) to have, not all food at meals has to be 100% healthy and having electronic media at meals is not all bad (e.g., an occasional movie night with dinner) if it facilitates family time,” she noted. “But, parents can take small steps to have quality time with their children by reducing media use at mealtimes.” \n",

      "By Masayuki Kitano \n",
      "SINGAPORE, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The yen rose in a short-covering rally on Friday, getting some respite in the wake of its recent slide to five-year lows versus the dollar and the euro. \n",
      "The yen’s climb built up steam due to stop-loss selling in the dollar and the euro versus the Japanese currency, traders said. \n",
      "The dollar fell 0.5 percent to 104.26 yen, down more than a full yen from a five-year high of 105.45 yen set on Thursday. Traders said there had been some stop-loss dollar offers at levels between 104.50 to 104.30 yen. \n",
      "“The dollar/yen run-up has been quite fast, quite rapid. So a bit of pullback ... is kind of normal for dollar/yen,” said Sim Moh Siong, FX strategist for Bank of Singapore. \n",
      "For the week, the dollar was down 0.9 percent against the yen, putting the greenback on track for its first weekly loss versus the yen since late October. \n",
      "Prior to this week the dollar had posted weekly gains against the yen in nine consecutive weeks, a period when currency speculators ramped up bets for the yen to weaken further. \n",
      "Data on currency futures positions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange shows that currency speculators had increased their net short position in the yen to 143,822 contracts in the week ended Dec. 24, the largest since July 2007 and up from 62,395 contracts in late October. \n",
      "How the dollar performs versus the yen next week after Japanese market players return from their New Year’s holidays will be key for the near-term outlook, said a U.S.-based currency trader. \n",
      "“I take all this movement with a grain of salt... Have to see what happens when Tokyo gets back in,” he said. \n",
      "“Next week we will know if uptrend is still intact or if we are in a real reversal,” the trader added. \n",
      "Some analysts said falls in equity markets the previous day may have acted as an initial catalyst for traders to cover their short positions in the yen. \n",
      "“I think if there’s anything concrete, it’s probably the equity market weakness, potentially higher risk aversion, and the pull-back in U.S. yields that to me are probably the two triggers for the move in dollar/yen,” said Mitul Kotecha, head of global foreign exchange strategy for Credit Agricole in Hong Kong. \n",
      "U.S. stock markets had fallen on Thursday as investors booked profits in the wake of the S&P; 500’s best yearly advance since 1997, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield  dipped back to levels below 3 percent. \n",
      "The euro shed 0.6 percent to 142.47 yen, extending its losses in the wake of its 1.2 percent slide the previous day. The single currency pulled away from a five-year peak of 145.67 yen set last Friday. \n",
      "Against the dollar, the euro held steady at about $1.3664 , staying within sight of a two-week low near $1.3630 set on Thursday. \n",
      "The euro has retreated in the wake of its rise to a two-year high of $1.3894 last Friday. \n",
      "The euro had risen in thin trading conditions in late December, supported by factors such as euro zone banks repatriating funds to shore up their capital bases before an asset quality review by the European Central Bank.\n",

      "(Corrects first and third paragraphs to show the state filed for reconsideration of Supreme Court decision. The state did not file an appeal.) \n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The state of Pennsylvania on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to reconsider its December decision that struck down parts of an oil and gas law. \n",
      "The Pennsylvania Supreme Court voted 4-2 in mid-December saying key provisions in Act 13, a 2012 law that governs oil and gas drilling, is unconstitutional. \n",
      "In a state known for its shale gas bounty, the decision broadened the rights of local governments to restrict the controversial fracking process within their city limits, dealing a blow to oil and gas interests. \n",

      "The state Department of Environmental Protection is also asking the court to reconsider its decision, saying its duty to protect public parks falls under provisions struck by the December decision. \n",
      "Seven municipalities and the Delaware Riverkeeper Network had challenged Act 13 in 2012, alleging it violates the state’s constitution. \n",
      "The ruling followed similar cases in New York state earlier this year that allowed two small towns to restrict natural gas drilling within their limits. Three cities in Colorado also voted against fracking last year. \n",

      "Preview: Oregon State at Colorado\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "When No. 24 Colorado opens its Pac-12 season by hosting Oregon State on Thursday, the Buffaloes’ emphasis will be on raising its defense to the high level already attained by its offense. “I’ve been hammering these guys on our defense,” Colorado coach Tad Boyle told the Boulder Daily Camera. “Our field goal percentage defense is not where it needs to be (ninth in the Pac-12 at 42.5 percent). ... It’s not fundamental. These guys are capable. They’ve proven it in the past. ...” The Buffaloes will face an immediate challenge in achieving their new goal as the Beavers are eighth in the nation in field goal percentage at 50.8. \n",
      "Part of the reason for Colorado’s defensive shortcoming was playing the eighth-toughest schedule, according to the RPI. “If we played easy teams, it would have just gone by without exposing our weakness,” said Wesley Gordon, a 6-9 freshman forward who has added a spark to the Buffaloes’ frontcourt. Oregon State’s non-conference schedule was ranked 267th among the 351 Division I teams, with Utah and its easiest schedule in the nation marking the only worse from a Pac-12 team. \n",
      "TV: 10 p.m. ET, ESPNU \n",
      "ABOUT OREGON STATE (8-4): The Beavers have two of the top eight scorers in the Pac-12 in senior guard Roberto Nelson (conference-leading 21.4 points per game) and senior forward Devon Collier (18). Oregon State senior center Angus Brandt (12.9 points, 4.6 rebounds), who missed two games with a knee injury, returned to the lineup and scored 21 points in a 76-68 victory over Quinnipiac on Sunday. It was a relief for the Beavers and Brandt, a 6-10 Australian who suffered a season-ending knee injury early in the 2012-13 campaign and thought it happened again when he left an 83-71 loss to Akron on Dec. 22 early in the second half. \n",
      "ABOUT COLORADO (11-2): Another influence of their schedule could be the Buffaloes’ 45.5 shooting percentage from the field, which is 10th in the Pac-12. Colorado, though, boasts three strong offensive options in junior guards Spencer Dinwiddie (15.8 points per game) and Askia Booker (12.6), and sophomore forward Josh Scott (13.1 points, fourth in the Pac-12 with 9.2 rebounds). The Buffaloes have nine players averaging at least 10 minutes, including three sophomores and three freshmen. \n",
      "TIP-INS \n",
      "1. Colorado, which has won nine straight at home, has a plus-10.5 rebounding margin while Oregon State is the only Pac-12 team with a negative margin at minus-0.7. \n",

      "3. The Buffaloes, who haven’t been 12-2 since the 1979-80 season, are 9-4 versus Oregon State, but lost the last meeting 64-58 in the 2012-13 regular-season finale. \n",

      "Islanders win on Okposo's overtime goal\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "Islanders win on Okposo’s overtime goal \n",
      "UNIONDALE, N.Y. — The New York Islanders play the Pittsburgh Penguins only once more this season and will not face the Nashville Predators again until next season. So right winger Kyle Okposo will have to take satisfaction in trying to prove from afar that Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma and Predators general manager David Poile — the head coach and general manager of the U.S. Olympic hockey team — made a mistake in leaving him off the American squad. \n",
      "He got off to a splendid start in that regard Thursday night, when Okposo scored the game-winning goal 58 seconds into overtime to lift the Islanders to a 3-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks at Nassau Coliseum. \n",
      "Okposo was left off the team — and, according to an ESPN.com report, was not even seriously considered for the squad — despite ranking second among all American-born players with 42 points. His goal Thursday gave him 16 points (eight goals and eight assists) in the Islanders’ last 11 games. \n",
      "“I think sometimes you get tough bounces in life and you don’t always achieve your goals,” Okposo said. “I felt like I left everything out there, so I don’t have anything to hang my head about.” \n",
      "Added Islanders head coach Jack Capuano: “Obviously it’s a tough day for him. I think we were all a little bit surprised when the team came out.” \n",
      "Okposo said he was not feeling particularly “jacked up” to prove anyone wrong Thursday and claimed he did not derive any extra satisfaction from scoring the game-winner. However, teammates and coaches were ecstatic to see him deliver what they believed to be a statement goal. \n",
      "Okposo was trailing the play when center John Tavares’ shot bounced off Canadiens goaltender Corey Crawford and to Okposo, who fired a sizzling shot over the shoulder of Crawford. \n",
      "Okposo celebrated the goal by pumping his right arm into the air and slamming his fists emphatically into the plastic along the boards. \n",
      "“I don’t know if he thought David Poile’s head was in the net and he was aiming for it, but I think he sent a message with that one,” Tavares said. \n",
      "The fans in the announced crowd of 13,618 that braved an oncoming blizzard on Long Island felt the same way. Less than two minutes after Okposo’s goal, chants of “U-S-A!” began raining down on the ice. \n",
      "“That was pretty special,” Okposo said. “Certainly got chills out there. To hear the fans chant like that, definitely pretty special.” \n",
      "Okposo’s dramatic goal punctuated an impressive effort by the Islanders, who have won a season-high three in a row and have beaten last year’s Stanley Cup finalists in their last two games. The Islanders (14-21-7) beat Boston, 5-3, on Tuesday. \n",
      "Center Casey Cizikas and left winger Thomas Vanek also scored for the Islanders, who took a 2-0 lead before the Blackhawks tied it with a pair of goals in a 3:04 span bridging the second and third periods. The Islanders have blown six two-goal leads this season at Nassau Coliseum, where they had lost eight in a row (0-4-4) heading into Thursday night. \n",
      "The Islanders had several chances to retake the lead in the third, including a point-blank miss by Tavares early in the period and a sequence of shots by Okposo, right winger Michael Grabner and center Frans Nielsen in the final two minutes. \n",
      "“With all the chances we had, you kind of felt hopefully that we didn’t let this one slip away,” Tavares said. “It’s very fitting Kyle was able to get that one.” \n",
      "Goaltender Evgeni Nabokov made 37 saves for the Islanders. \n",
      "Defenseman Brent Seabrook and right winger Ben Smith scored for the Blackhawks (29-7-8), who are 5-0-3 in their last eight games. With the point gained from the overtime loss, Chicago broke a tie with Anaheim for the overall NHL lead in points. \n",
      "Crawford, who was playing for the first time since suffering a lower body injury on Dec. 8, had 31 saves. \n",
      "“I thought we worked but we didn’t work smart tonight,” Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said. “But a positive out of the game was Corey’s play. Got us a point and made some real key stops particularly late in the game.” \n",
      "NOTES: Only two Islanders home games were postponed due to the weather. Blizzards forced postponements on Feb. 7, 1978, and March 13, 1993. ... Before Thursday, the Islanders went 0-3-1 in their previous four home games against the reigning Stanley Cup champion dating back to a win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Nov. 27, 2009. ... Islanders C Josh Bailey participated in the morning skate but missed his third consecutive game due to an upper-body injury. ... The only other scratch for the Islanders was LW Eric Boulton. ... The Blackhawks are carrying three goalies until they return home Sunday. Antti Raanta, who took over when G Corey Crawford got hurt Dec. 8 and went 8-1-2 in Crawford’s absence, was the backup Thursday. Jason LaBarbera was a scratch. ... The Blackhawks also scratched D Sheldon Brookbank and D Michal Rozsival. ... Chicago visits the New Jersey Devils on Friday to complete the Blackhawks’ 11th set of back-to-back games this year — but only the second played entirely on the road. ... The Islanders host the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday.\n",

      "By Sam Forgione \n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Pimco Total Return Fund, the world’s largest bond fund, had  a negative return for 2013 of nearly 2 percent, its first annual loss in 14 years, as fears of a reduction in the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying sent Treasury prices lower, preliminary data from Morningstar showed on Thursday. \n",
      "The performance was the weakest for the fund since 1994, when it posted a negative return of 3.6 percent, Morningstar data showed. The fund declined about 1 percent in December, beating just 6 percent of peers, according to preliminary Morningstar data. \n",
      "Pimco Total Return, with $244 billion in assets, is the flagship of the Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co. Bill Gross, the legendary manager of the fund, is the firm’s co-founder and co-chief investment officer. \n",
      "The performance of Gross’s fund is closely watched because Pimco manages roughly $1.97 trillion in assets and is one of the world’s largest bond managers. Gross’s views, along with those of co-Chief Investment Officer and Chief Executive Mohamed El-Erian, are widely influential. \n",
      "Pimco is a unit of European financial services company Allianz SE. \n",
      "The fund suffered last year from a sizeable bet on U.S. Treasuries, whose prices declined after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled in late May that the central bank could begin scaling back its bond-buying stimulus if the U.S. economy looked strong enough. \n",
      "“It highlights the risk of bond investing, that even managers with billions of assets under their guidance can have a bad year,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P; Capital IQ. \n",
      "The Pimco Total Return Fund had a 37 percent exposure to Treasuries at the end of May, making it the fund’s largest holding, according to data released on the Pimco website last year and compiled by Reuters. The fund’s exposure to U.S. government debt remained high throughout the year despite the selloff in Treasuries, and was at 37 percent at the end of November. \n",
      "Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury soared after Bernanke testified before Congress on May 22 that the central bank could begin scaling back its $85 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgages later in 2013. \n",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield, which fell to a low for the year of 1.62 percent on May 2, ended 2013 above 3 percent, an increase of about 140 basis points. Bond yields move inversely to their prices. \n",
      "In recent letters to investors and posts on social media platform Twitter, Gross has recommended that investors buy shorter-dated Treasuries on expectations that the Fed will keep short-term interest rates low until 2016 or later. \n",
      "The Pimco Total Return Exchange-Traded Fund, an actively managed ETF designed to mimic the strategy of the flagship mutual fund, fell 0.85 percent in December, making it the worst performer of its category for the month and resulting in a drop of 1.2 percent for the year. \n",
      "That annual return still beat 80 percent of peers, however, according to the preliminary data from Morningstar. Investors pulled $115.8 million from the ETF in December, marking its eighth straight month of withdrawals, Morningstar data showed. The ETF has about $3.5 billion in assets. \n",
      "Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund , a competitor to the Pimco fund, fell 0.7 percent in December, beating 19 percent of peers. The fund had outflows of $2.08 billion in December, Reuters reported on Wednesday. \n",
      "Gundlach’s fund, which has about $31 billion in assets and is the flagship of Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, rose 0.02 percent last year, beating 88 percent of peers, according to the preliminary Morningstar data. \n",

      "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Veteran technology journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher have unveiled “Re/code,” a technology news site and conference business to succeed AllThingsD which they founded and built into a premier tech media brand within News Corp. \n",
      "Mossberg and Swisher, who agreed in September to sever a 10-year relationship with News Corp, said on Thursday their new venture will be backed by Comcast’s NBCUniversal and Windsor Media, the investment company headed by former Yahoo! Inc Chief Executive Terry Semel. \n",
      "Mossberg and Swisher will hold majority ownership in the venture, with NBCUniversal and Windsor Media sharing a minority stake. \n",
      "“It says a lot about NBC in particular that a big media company would take a small share of a startup, provide plenty of funding without trying to control it,” Mossberg said by phone. “In order to grow, we needed a fully independent structure.” \n",
      "Mossberg declined to discuss financial details of the deal or the valuation of his new company, but said Re/code will share editorial resources with NBCUniversal. \n",
      "Re/code’s journalists, which include many former AllThingsD staff, will appear on programs such as CNBC and NBC News, while sites such as msnbc.com will run their work. Re/code will also partner with CNBC to host conferences. \n",
      "Both long-time Wall Street Journal reporters, Swisher and Mossberg founded AllThingsD in 2003 as an annual technology industry gathering. \n",
      "The blog launched in 2007 and in 2007 News Corp acquired Dow Jones, and with it the profitable AllThingsD. With the dissolution of AllThingsD’s relationship with News Corp, the site will remain online but the brand will be phased out. \n",
      "In the absence of AllThingsD - and with the introduction of a new competitor - the Journal has announced a new technology section complete with gadget reviews (formerly written by Mossberg) and beefed-up coverage from its San Francisco and bureaus in Asia and Israel. \n",
      "But neither the Journal nor Re/code will inherit the crown jewel of the AllThingsD brand - the lucrative annual conferences that regularly drew names like Steve Jobs, the late Apple Inc  chief executive. \n",
      "The Journal said it would begin hosting its own tech conference called WSJD in late October in southern California. \n",
      "Mossberg said the same team that produced the AllThingsD conference will produce a rebranded event called the “Code Conference” during the same week and at the same hotel. \n",
      "Re/code is just one of several new arrivals in the crowded tech media arena. \n",
      "Earlier this year, Jessica Lessin, another Wall Street Journal reporter, also defected to launch The Information, a premium, subscription-based tech news site. Yahoo is also preparing a consumer tech site with David Pogue, the former New York Times gadget reviewer. \n",
      "“Tech sites and tech conferences are areas that people think are in demand and can be both journalistically valuable and financially successful,” Mossberg said. “We’re obviously hoping the same.”\n",

      "Tunisian police arrest more militants, seize arms\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia said on Thursday it had arrested four militants and seized arms and explosives in the southern town of Sidi Bouzid following increased security checks prompted by fears of attacks by radical Islamists during New Year celebrations. \n",
      "The detentions followed the arrest of seven Salafists, or ultra-conservative Islamists, on Sunday in the western town of Kasserine. \n",
      "“The national police arrested four terrorists belonging to a banned organization on Wednesday night. A Kalashnikov piece, munitions and explosives were seized during the operation,” Tunisia’s interior ministry said in a statement. \n",
      "Local media reports said police had exchanged gunfire with the militants in Sidi Bouzid on Wednesday night and that a police officer has been injured. The ministry declined to confirm the reports. \n",
      "State media said on Monday U.S. and Libyan forces had captured the leader of Tunisia’s Islamist militants, Ansar al-Shariaa, in the Libyan city of Misrata, but his group denied he had been taken and the U.S. army denied any involvement. \n",
      "The interior ministry’s statement did not say whether the four militants arrested belonged to al-Sahriaa’s organization. \n",
      "Last week, Tunisian police seized 60kg of gold, worth around $2.3 million, as they checked vehicles in the same city of Sidi Bouzid. The authorities said it was too early to say whether the gold had come from or was destined for militant groups. \n",
      "The seven Salafists arrested on Sunday had been distributing leaflets demanding a ban on New Year celebrations and had threatened bakeries selling cakes for the occasion, local media said. \n",
      "New Year celebrations used to be a big event in Tunisia, the most secular country in the Arab world, but they have faded since the revolution that toppled President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali in early 2011, paving the way for the moderate Islamist Ennahda party to take power. \n",
      "After a recent political crisis over the role of Islam in politics, the Ennahda party agreed to resign and will hand over to a caretaker government by January 14, the third anniversary of Ben Ali’s fall. \n",
      "Ultra-conservative Salafists, who want to impose an Islamic state, returned from exile or prison after Ben Ali was toppled. \n",

      "RPT-Railcars in North Dakota crude train crash older, less safe-investigators\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "* Railcars don’t meet industry’s latest safety standards \n",
      "* Crude loaded in North Dakota, bound for Missouri \n",
      "By Alicia Underlee Nelson \n",
      "FARGO, N.D., Dec 31 (Reuters) - The railcars carrying crude oil that crashed into a derailed grain train in North Dakota on Monday were all older types that do not meet the latest industry safety standards, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday. \n",
      "Robert Sumwalt, who is leading the NTSB’s investigation into the collision of two BNSF Railway Co trains, said the cylindrical tank cars on the oil train were known as DOT-111s, which are widely used to move crude and ethanol. \n",
      "In October 2011, the American Association of Railroads, the rail industry’s trade group, adopted new standards requiring tank cars manufactured after that date to have thicker hulls and reinforced valves to better protect against punctures and leaks in derailments. U.S. regulators also are considering tougher safety standards. \n",
      "“Our preliminary information is that none of the cars were of the newer design,” Sumwalt said at a news conference in Fargo, North Dakota, east of the crash site. \n",
      "Those details go to the heart of growing debate about stronger safety measures as the oil-by-rail movement grows in tandem with the U.S. shale oil boom. \n",
      "Such measures could include tighter rules for moving highly flammable types of crude, such as the light-sweet variety produced in the Bakken shale play, or costly retrofits of older tank railcars. \n",
      "Monday’s crash of the 106-car eastbound BNSF crude train into a derailed westbound BNSF grain train set off explosions near a small town west of Fargo, North Dakota, and a fire that still burned more than 24 hours later. \n",
      "No injuries were reported, but the crash was among several explosive derailments in 2013 involving trains hauling oil. The worst accident by far happened in July in a small Quebec town when a runaway train derailed and exploded, killing 47 people. \n",
      "The NTSB has said at least 69 percent of railcars in use were built before 2011. The rail industry also has said it could cost $1 billion to retrofit all those railcars to meet the post-October 2011 standard. \n",
      "BNSF Chief Executive Officer Matt Rose, who is stepping down as CEO on Wednesday but will remain chairman, told Reuters in an interview in November that the company supports phasing out those older cars over seven years, which allows companies enough time to build replacements. \n",
      "BNSF is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc . \n",
      "1300-MILE TRIP \n",
      "Sumwalt said the crude involved in the crash was loaded onto the train in Fryburg, North Dakota, and was headed nearly 1,300 miles (2,092 km) to Hayti, Missouri. \n",
      "Sources familiar with the loading operations told Reuters on Tuesday that Houston-based logistics company Great Northern Midstream loaded the crude at Fryburg, and it was to be unloaded at Marquis Energy’s storage terminal and barge loading facility at Hayti, along the Mississippi River. \n",
      "Great Northern Midstream referred all questions to the NTSB, and Marquis Energy did not return a call seeking comment. Both companies are privately held. \n",
      "Marquis Energy’s Hayti operation receives crude via rail, then transports it via barge to refiners along the river and the U.S. Gulf Coast. \n",
      "The U.S. East and West coasts are the major destinations for railed Bakken crude, as it is cheaper than imports and rail is the main transport choice because pipeline infrastructure is lacking. \n",
      "The U.S. Gulf Coast market has less demand for Bakken crude because growing pipeline infrastructure in Texas increasingly moves burgeoning Texas output - also largely light sweet crudes that are cheaper than imports - to Gulf Coast refineries.\n",

      "“This year will be one of steady progress, but I’d be amazed if we get the same returns this year as last year.” \n",
      "Markus Huber, senior sales trader at Peregrine & Black, also felt the FTSE would hit the 7,000 level in the first half of this year, and added that the start of 2014 could soon see fresh money come back into the UK stock market.\n",

      "Snapchat says millions of user accounts compromised\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Snapchat, the red-hot private messaging service, said on Thursday that it knew for months about a security loophole that allowed hackers this week to harvest millions of phone numbers and announced changes to its systems. \n",
      "An anonymous group called Snapchat DB posted the usernames and phone numbers of 4.6 million Snapchat users on New Year’s Eve, days after the startup - headed by 23-year old founder Evan Spiegel - brushed off warnings that its app still contained security loopholes. \n",
      "The hacker group, which claimed to be based in the United States and Europe, made the entire database available for download but redacted the last two digits of every phone number. Snapchat DB said it was working to raise awareness about Snapchat’s security holes, not out of malicious intent. \n",
      "In its first public statement since the leak, Snapchat said in a blog post on Thursday that no “snaps” - the contents of messages - were compromised or accessed as part of the hack. \n",
      "Snapchat was first alerted to the vulnerability in August by a security group called Gibson Security. Snapchat said it made changes to its system to address the weaknesses, but the company also published a blog post downplaying the threat as “theoretical” on December 27. \n",
      "Snapchat DB carried out the hack and disclosed the phone numbers just four days later. \n",
      "The hack was a rare black eye for a high-flying appmaker started by Stanford University undergraduates in 2011. Snapchat has soared in popularity over the past year because it allows its users - mostly teens - to send private pictures and messages that self-destruct after 10 seconds at most. \n",
      "Snapchat’s immense popularity among young users has made it one of the most closely watched social media companies in the world, and Facebook Inc reportedly offered $3 billion last year in a failed acquisition bid. \n",
      "Snapchat asks new users for their phone number so that their friends can find them on the service. The phone numbers were not attached to any real names. \n",
      "Calling the hackers’ disclosure an “abuse” of its system, Snapchat said Thursday that it was first told by security experts in August that its “Find Friends” feature may contain a weakness. \n",
      "The company did not apologize for the leaks but said it would carry out some changes to prevent further unwanted disclosures. \n",
      "“We will be releasing an updated version of the Snapchat application that will allow Snapchatters to opt out of appearing in Find Friends after they have verified their phone number,” the company wrote. “We’re also improving rate limiting and other restrictions to address future attempts to abuse our service.” \n",
      "Rate limiting restricts how many times a party can query the Snapchat servers. \n",
      "In an email to Reuters, the group claiming to be behind the New Years Eve hack called it “promising” that Snapchat was beginning to address its security vulnerabilities. \n",
      "“Let’s hope they aren’t trying to downplay the situation once again and avoid the heat, but instead taking reasonable steps to secure sensitive user information,” Snapchat DB said. “Actions speak louder than words.” \n",

      "5 Min Read\n",
      "* Shares jump to levels last seen in August 2011 \n",
      "* Market likes price, lack of capital increase to fund deal \n",
      "* Fiat’s growing debt burden worries analysts \n",
      "* Doubts remain over Fiat’s European recovery \n",
      "* Fitch sees no immediate impact on Fiat’s rating   (Adds unions, analyst, Fitch, updates shares) \n",
      "By Agnieszka Flak \n",
      "MILAN, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Fiat’s $4.35 billion deal to gain full control of Chrysler Group LLC sent its shares to a near 2-1/2-year high on Thursday, despite doubts over whether the Italian carmaker could use the merger to cut losses in Europe. \n",
      "Investors welcomed the deal struck by Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, under which Fiat will buy the 41.46 percent of the No. 3 U.S. automaker it does not already own, without raising funds from the stock market. \n",
      "Marchionne, who has run both companies since Chrysler’s 2009 U.S. government-funded bankruptcy restructuring, aims to merge the two into the world’s seventh-largest auto group. \n",
      "However, analysts were concerned that the deal will increase Fiat’s already heavy debt burden, despite a relatively low price negotiated by Marchionne after more than a year of talks. \n",
      "Fiat shares rose as much as 16 percent to levels last seen in August 2011 after the deal, which aims to combine the two automakers’ resources and rejuvenate Fiat’s product line-up. It was the stock’s biggest intraday gain since April 2009. \n",
      "“They paid less than the market had expected, and there will be no capital increase to fund this, so no wonder the stock is flying,” a Milan-based trader said. \n",
      "“While it’s still to be seen how this will bode for Fiat’s future, this is a good start to the year for a company that has had quite a tough ride recently, especially in Europe.” \n",
      "Fiat will buy the stake in the U.S. group from a retirees’ healthcare trust affiliated to the United Auto Workers union, with Chrysler putting up most of the funding. \n",
      "However, Citigroup analysts said Fiat’s debt would become the highest for any European motor manufacturer. \n",
      "“Group net debt will rise to around 10 billion euros ($13.8 billion),” they said in a note. “We continue to have concerns about the sustainability of this heavy debt burden.” \n",
      "It remains to be seen whether the merger will cut Fiat’s losses in Europe, where it had promised to break even by 2016. Fiat’s plan depends on its ability to share technology, cash and dealer networks with Chrysler easily and cheaply. \n",
      "Chrysler and Fiat currently have to manage their finances separately. A full merger will make it easier - but not automatic - to combine the cash pools of the two companies, giving Fiat more funds to expand its product line-up. \n",
      "Fitch ratings agency said Fiat may not immediately be able to fully access Chrysler’s cash as this would require a refinancing of the U.S. firm’s credit agreement and bonds. Fitch will review its rating in early 2014. \n",
      "Chrysler’s booming U.S. sales are now a profit centre for Fiat, helping to offset losses in Europe. The deal raises expectations that investments could be channelled into underused Italian plants to launch new models in what analysts expect to be a steadying market from 2014. \n",
      "Italy’s unions and government hope the deal will boost jobs and cut state spending. Several Fiat plants have been working only a few days a month, with thousands of workers currently in state-backed temporary lay-off schemes to avoid job losses. \n",
      "“It’s essential that Fiat tells us what they plan to do in our country,” Susanna Camusso, head of the CGIL union, said. \n",
      "Fiat has repeatedly reassured unions and politicians it does not intend to close factories, unlike some of its competitors, but doubts remain, given Fiat’s growing U.S. presence. Analysts already said a U.S. listing could be the next step. \n",
      "“We assume Fiat will go on to pursue a U.S. listing of some sort in due course,” Bernstein said in a note. \n",
      "Fiat has said it plans to build Jeeps and a new line of Alfa Romeos in Italy for export to markets in Asia, Latin America and the United States to offset flagging demand in crisis-hit Italy. A new industrial plan outlining Fiat’s overall spending strategy and models will be released in April. \n",
      "But whether Marchionne will put billions of euros into Italy and Europe, where the group has lost much of its market position in recent years, or elsewhere is still uncertain. \n",
      "“The bad news is that he’s spent no money for the past two years at Fiat because he was waiting for this to happen,” said a London-based analyst at a major investment bank. \n",
      "“He’s not getting any exposure to European recovery. The U.S. asset is not as good as its peers and needs money spent on it. Marchionne has shown he can get the job done, but I’m still buying a dream.” \n",
      "By 1558 GMT Fiat shares were up 15.2 percent at 6.86 euros, with traded volume six times the previous month’s daily average.  ($1 = 0.7257 euros)   (Additional reporting by Valentina Za in Milan and Laurence Frost in Paris; Editing by David Stamp and Will Waterman)\n",

      "Price was charged with giving false information and taken to jail, where he told authorities his correct name, Jump said. \n",
      "At a federal court hearing on Thursday, a U.S. magistrate judge ordered Price to remain in police custody until a detention hearing set for Monday in Savannah, court records showed. \n",
      "A U.S. marshal told the judge that Price said he was homeless and lived as a migrant worker, accepting cash for odd jobs, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. \n",
      "The bank fraud charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. \n",
      "Price previously controlled an investment group that put $10 million into Montgomery Bank & Trust, a small bank in Ailey, Georgia, according to the federal indictment. \n",
      "After being named a bank director, he “fraudulently obtained over $21 million of MB&T; funds, which he then misappropriated, embezzled and lost in speculative trading and other investing,” the indictment said. \n",
      "In an effort to hide the fraud, Price provided bank officials with fabricated account statements, the indictment said. Regulators later shut down the bank’s two branches. \n",
      "He was indicted in New York last year on securities and wire fraud charges connected to the scheme. \n",
      "Before his arrest on Tuesday, Price was last seen boarding a ferry in Key West, Florida, in June 2012. Investigators at the time speculated that he either committed suicide or fled to Venezuela. \n",
      "The FBI had put him on the agency’s “Most Wanted” list and continued to search for him. \n",
      "Price’s wife believed he was dead, her attorney said on Thursday. She asked a Florida judge to declare her husband deceased last year for estate planning purposes and now will seek to have the declaration set aside, lawyer John Holt said. \n",
      "Rebeka Price does not know where her husband spent the last 18 months, Holt said. \n",
      "“She’s been completely in the dark,” the lawyer said. \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG has settled a U.S. lawsuit in which shareholders accused it of misrepresenting its ability to handle risks associated with mortgage debt prior to the 2008 financial crisis. \n",
      "The settlement in principle was disclosed in a filing on Thursday by Deutsche Bank’s lawyers in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Terms were not disclosed, and final paperwork is expected within 30 days, the filing said. \n",
      "Shareholders accused Deutsche Bank of misleading them about its risk management and the underwriting on mortgage debt it packaged and sold, as well as being too slow to take write-downs. \n",
      "They said this contributed to an 87 percent drop in the German bank’s share price from May 2007 to January 2009. \n",
      "The settlement came after U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest on October 29 refused to let the case proceed as a class action, citing flaws in the methods and conclusions reached by an expert hired by the shareholders. \n",
      "Denials of class certification can boost litigation costs and make it harder for plaintiffs to obtain large recoveries. \n",
      "Plaintiffs included the Building Trades United Pension Trust Fund of Elm Grove, Wisconsin, and two mutual funds. \n",
      "John Grant, a lawyers for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro declined to comment. \n",
      "The lawsuit is separate from Deutsche Bank’s agreement last month to pay $1.9 billion to settle claims it defrauded U.S. government-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the sale of mortgage-backed securities. \n",
      "The most recently settled case is IBEW Local 90 Pension Fund et al v. Deutsche Bank AG et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-04209. \n",

      "4 Min Read\n",
      "* Trade group warns politicians against ‘social romanticism’ \n",
      "* Sees German GDP growing 1.5 percent in 2014 \n",
      "By Sarah Marsh \n",
      "BERLIN, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Germany’s BGA trade group criticised Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government on Thursday, saying its policies risked deterring investment and crimping economic growth by raising employment costs. \n",
      "The group predicts German economic growth will pick up to 1.5 percent in 2014 from around 0.5 percent last year thanks to a strengthening global economy and rising demand for products “Made in Germany”. \n",
      "But the new government’s plans may discourage firms from investing for longer-term success, BGA head Anton Boerner told a news conference. Data shows Germany’s investment rate has shrunk to around 17 percent of output from some 20 percent in 1999. \n",
      "“Politicians must look reality in the face and stop with ‘social romanticism’ so that we still receive as many orders in 10 years time as today,” Boerner said. \n",
      "“We are heading into a year that will be marked by global economic stimulus,” he said. But the deal brokered between Merkel’s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats late last year meant that “in Germany this will be accompanied by more regulation and rising labour costs”. \n",
      "Germany, one of the world’s biggest exporters, has come under heavy pressure during the euro zone debt crisis to let wages rise to encourage its consumers to buy more from their neighbours in the currency bloc. \n",
      "Major unions negotiated inflation-busting hikes in paychecks last year after years of wage restraint, although the Statistics Office said last month real wages across Germany were likely to have fallen in 2013. \n",
      "The number of people in work in Germany hit a record high for the seventh consecutive year in 2013, data showed on Thursday, while more than one in four people is officially out of work in euro countries such as Spain and Greece. \n",
      "But one in seven of the 1,000 firms surveyed by the BGA said it would invest less in view of the coalition deal while fewer than one in 20 firms intended to invest more. \n",
      "Many German business leaders have, like Boerner, criticised the coalition deal, saying it rows back on economic reforms introduced a decade ago that have been credited with turning the former “Sick Man of Europe” into its powerhouse. \n",
      "The coalition plan includes a nationwide minimum wage of 8.50 euros per hour to be phased in by 2017, a chance to retire at the age of 63 for those who have worked for 45 years, and higher pensions for mothers whose children were born before 1992. \n",
      "“Solutions for the long-term problems and necessary steps to secure our competitiveness have been further postponed,” said Boerner, adding that three quarters of firms surveyed did not believe the deal would make Germany more competitive. \n",
      "“This means German companies will lose contracts to others around the world,” he said, warning that Germany faced ever more competition from emerging markets like China. \n",
      "Nonetheless the BGA said earlier this week it expects German exports, which have been the cornerstone of Europe’s largest economy for decades, to grow by up to 3 percent in 2014 to a record 1.142 trillion euros. [ID:nL6N0K92UL}   (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)\n",

      "Crippled Kashagan oil project a bureaucratic nightmare\n",
      "8 Min Read\n",
      "* Production halted shortly after start-up by pipeline leaks \n",
      "* Seven-partner project suffering long delays and cost over-runs \n",
      "* Now run collectively instead of usual single operator model \n",
      "* One source calls it a “nightmare” operating “by committee” \n",
      "By Andrew Callus and Stephen Jewkes \n",
      "LONDON/MILAN Jan 2 (Reuters) - Giant Kazakh oilfield Kashagan, which was brought to a halt by leaks shortly after start-up last year, is grappling with a bureaucratic “nightmare” on top of its engineering troubles as it strives for commercial production in 2014. \n",
      "The scale and complexity of the world’s most expensive standalone oil project led its seven partners away from the traditional single operator command-and-control model, where one of the larger companies takes charge while the others provide support and share the risks, costs and rewards. \n",
      "The consortium, which includes ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Kazakh state oil firm KazMunaiGas(KMG), first put one of the smaller partners - Italy’s Eni - in charge of construction and delivery in 2001/02. They retreated from that decision in 2008/09 after years of delays and cost escalation, opting instead for collective responsibility. \n",
      "This has created problems along the way, and is an extra headache for engineers and managers as they battle to find out why a pipeline started to leak last year, just weeks after oil flowed for the first time, and to fix the problem so that oil can flow out and revenue in. \n",
      "“It’s a bit of a nightmare to be honest,” said one industry source with knowledge of the project. “The consortium is the operator until first commercial production, so it’s all a bit ‘by committee’ until then.” \n",
      "The Caspian Sea project aims to exploit the biggest oil discovery in decades, producing a peak of 1.66 million barrels a day - as much oil as OPEC member Angola, from a reserve almost as big as Brazil’s. Much of it is built on artificial islands to avoid damage from pack ice in a shallow sea that freezes for five months a year in temperatures that drop below minus 30 degrees Celsius (-22F). \n",
      "The field extends over 3,375 square kilometres (1,303 sq miles), and the whole onshore and offshore site is bigger still. The oil is 4,200 metres (4,590 yards) below the seabed, at very high pressure, and the associated gas reaching the surface is mixed with some of the highest concentrations of toxic, metal-eating hydrogen sulphide (H2S) ever encountered. \n",
      "Kashagan has cost an estimated $50 billion so far, five times early projections, and its 13-year life is a tale mostly of delay. \n",
      "In September and October 2013, pipeline leaks that investigators think were caused by H2S-linked stress cracks led to shutdown. \n",
      "Commercial production could be many months away as a result, and the engineering difficulties have exposed the shortcomings of the unwieldy administrative structure, which will stay in place until the oil is flowing properly. \n",
      "Agip, Eni’s engineering arm, was initially the operator and is still nominally in charge of the construction and delivery phase, much of it conducted by Eni unit Saipem. \n",
      "But the operatorship changed in 2009 when a new entity, representing all the partners and called the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), took over. \n",
      "“It gives you a headache just thinking about it,” said a second source. \n",
      "“There used to be a normal operatorship set-up. Now it’s just one committee after another. Each company has its own internal auditing, permitting procedures, personnel management, communication, etc. Every single step has to be seen by everyone else. It’s as if there was no CEO but the board met every day.” \n",
      "It won’t get any simpler when the oil starts flowing. \n",
      "Shell will then take over management of production operations along with KMG, the NCOC website says. \n",
      "Shell will also take on planning, development and construction of phase 2 of the project’s offshore facilities, which is designed to bring it up to full production, but Agip will do the onshore work, and ExxonMobil will do the phase 2 development drilling. \n",
      "Meanwhile, Total, the fourth international oil company (IOC) in the consortium, is conducting the leaks investigation, including use of a “pigging” pipeline investigation robot. \n",
      "The companies involved in the project have also changed over the years. BP, BG Group and ConocoPhillips  have all sold out. \n",
      "Sources among the bolters say picking Eni as operator - much less experienced in giant projects than some of its partners - was the result of unwillingness among the bigger players to see one of their near rivals operate such a prestigious scheme. \n",
      "They say that lack of experience might have contributed to Kashagan’s problems and to the change of approach in 2009. Eni declined to comment on that suggestion, but a spokesman said the company “was awarded operatorship of the project as the outcome of a selection process within the venture group”. \n",
      "For now, all eyes are on the investigation. \n",
      "According to a statement by NCOC in December, tests carried out on parts of the pipe by TWI Laboratories in Cambridge, England, found the cracks were caused by a reaction between water and H2S, which is known in the industry as sour gas. \n",
      "Why this reaction caused the pipe to crack remains unclear, and one expert said the search for the reason - and a solution - was like “finding a needle in a haystack”. \n",
      "The leaks, in the onshore section of a 95-km pipeline taking gas ashore for processing, have caused some to question the quality specification of the pipes, given the high H2S content. \n",
      "Reuters has been unable to ascertain the exact type of pipe  used, but experts say it was most likely a carbon steel pipe, given the high cost of using alloy for such a length. \n",
      "A spokesman for NCOC said the pipeline was “aligned with the X60 specification” - a reference to a grade of pipe that tends to be carbon steel but can also be alloy. \n",
      "The spokesman said the X60 grade pipes were dealing with associated gas containing approximately 15 percent of H2S and were designed to withstand concentrations of 12 to 15 percent. \n",
      "“The pipeline design basis has very recently been confirmed by experts, and it would have been designed in exactly the same way if it had been built today,” the spokesman said. \n",
      "A source with secondary knowledge of the investigation said the consortium was looking at whether the pipes were up to the job and whether costlier grades should have been fitted. \n",
      "The NCOC spokesman declined to answer further questions about the pipes. \n",
      "Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd, which merged with Nippon Steel Corp in 2012 to become Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp (NSSM), supplied pipe to Kashagan seven years ago, according to a company official who did not want to be named. \n",
      "The official said some of the pipes that leaked were among those supplied by Sumitomo. He said the company had been asked to look into the past manufacturing record of the pipes supplied to Kashagan and found they met all requirements. \n",
      "NSSM also declined further comment on the pipes used. \n",
      "Another area of investigation is the welding. The consortium said in December that the Cambridge lab was looking at the pipeline joints. The NCOC expects to have the results from the robot “pigging” search in early 2014. \n",
      "The IOCs - Exxon, Shell, Total and Eni - and KMG each has a 16.81 percent stake in Kashagan. Japan’s Inpex has 7.56 percent, and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC)  acquired 8.33 percent in 2013 as ConocoPhillips exited.\n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   has converted much of its debt in building products company USG Corp into more than $600 million of common stock in a successful investment made in the wake of the financial crisis. \n",
      "According to regulatory filings on Tuesday and Thursday, Berkshire acquired 21.39 million USG shares last month by exchanging $243.8 million of convertible notes it held in Chicago-based USG. \n",
      "That boosted its USG stake to 38.46 million shares, or more than 27 percent, worth $1.09 billion as of Tuesday’s close. \n",
      "The stake makes Berkshire the largest shareholder of USG. It could rise above 30 percent if Berkshire was to swap its remaining $56.2 million of USG notes, a filing shows. \n",
      "Shares of USG rose 0.7 percent to $28.60 on Thursday. \n",
      "A USG spokesman declined to comment on Berkshire’s stake. He said USG has roughly 139 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis following last month’s redemption. \n",
      "Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, and Canada’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd  in late 2008 acquired $400 million of USG convertible senior notes in a private placement. \n",
      "With that deal and others in the same time period, Berkshire gained a reputation as a lender of last resort when financial markets come under strain. \n",
      "The USG notes had a 10 percent interest rate, the same that Berkshire got when it invested $8 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc and General Electric Co. \n",
      "Berkshire also bought $300 million of senior notes with a 15 percent rate from motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc. \n",
      "USG last month redeemed $325 million of the notes at a premium, and Berkshire exercised its right to swap its securities into USG common stock at just $11.40 per share. \n",

      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is coming into City Hall with a sweeping mandate to address the city’s most vexing problems, from economic inequality to police and community relations. \n",
      "But first, he will have to manage a snowstorm. \n",
      "A winter storm that is due to hit on Thursday, de Blasio’s second day in office, could pose the first challenge to the new mayor, as he tries to enact a progressive agenda while ensuring the city of more than 8 million people is well managed. \n",
      "De Blasio succeeds Michael Bloomberg, who had no political experience when he took office in 2001 but had founded and run the successful company that takes his name. De Blasio, a Democrat, most recently was the city’s public advocate and, before that, served two terms in the city council. \n",
      "“This will be first test, and he’s got to pull it off as close to flawlessly as he can,” said Douglas Muzzio, a professor at Baruch College at the City University of New York. “He’s got to send the message, ‘I can run this joint.’” \n",
      "Storms have famously complicated the political lives of New York mayors. In the winter of 1969, a storm that dropped 15 inches of snow created a political crisis for Mayor John Lindsay, who was faulted for the city’s slow response. \n",
      "In 2010, Bloomberg came under fire for his handling of a blizzard that shut down some subway lines for days. \n",
      "“If we see a situation worsening we’re going to take very aggressive action. So it’s very much on our screens,” de Blasio told reporters this week. \n",
      "De Blasio, who is moving into the mayoral residence of Gracie Mansion in Manhattan, asserted his outer-borough credentials by mentioning that he remains a homeowner in the borough of Brooklyn. \n",
      "New York City consists of five counties known as boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. \n",
      "Bloomberg, who was first elected as a Republican but dropped his party affiliation, was criticized for letting snow pile up in Queens and allowing large parts of Brooklyn go unplowed for days in 2010. \n",
      "Regardless of what Mother Nature sends the city’s way, de Blasio has his work cut out for him as he kicks off his first week in office. \n",
      "De Blasio has said one of his first acts will be to dismantle the horse-and-buggy industry in Central Park, which has long been a tourist draw but has been the target of animal-rights groups. \n",
      "Perhaps the defining issue of de Blasio’s campaign for mayor was the issue of stop and frisk, a police tactic that critics say has led to racial profiling of young black and Latino men in low-income neighborhoods. \n",
      "At the height of the Democratic primary last summer, de Blasio - who is white and whose wife, Chirlane McCray, is black - began broadcasting an ad that featured his mixed race son, Dante, and spelled out de Blasio’s criticism of the tactic. \n",
      "The ad boosted de Blasio’s popularity among black and Latino voters and helped push policing to the top of the debate. \n",
      "But first, de Blasio will have to quiet critics who say he lacks the management experience to be a great mayor. \n",
      "Muzzio predicted de Blasio would rise to the occasion. \n",
      "“Those types of events, they’re defining in a way that a legislative victory is not,” he said, adding half-jokingly: “You’ll see de Blasio riding a snow plow. There will not be a screwup.” \n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government should grant former NSA contractor Edward Snowden clemency or a plea bargain given the public value of revelations over the National Security Agency’s vast spying programs, the New York Times editorial board said on Thursday. \n",
      "In its lead editorial, the newspaper said Americans now more fully understand how widely their phone calls, emails and other information are tracked. Information provided to journalists by Snowden has also prompted needed legal review of the intelligence gathering and led a presidential panel to call for a major overhaul of the agency, it said. \n",
      "“Considering the enormous value of the information he has revealed, and the abuses he has exposed, Mr. Snowden deserves better than a life of permanent exile, fear and flight. He may have committed a crime to do so, but he has done his country a great service,” the New York Times’ editorial board wrote. \n",
      "The Guardian, a British newspaper that along with The Washington Post received Snowden’s leaked documents, also called for President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden in its own editorial published on Wednesday. \n",
      "“We hope that calm heads within the present administration are working on a strategy to allow Mr Snowden to return to the U.S. with dignity, and the president to use his executive powers to treat him humanely and in a manner that would be a shining example about the value of whistleblowers and of free speech itself,” The Guardian wrote. \n",
      "Snowden, living in Russia with temporary asylum, last year leaked documents he collected while working for the NSA. The United States has charged him with espionage, and more charges could follow. \n",
      "The disclosures have sparked a debate over how much leeway to give the U.S. government in gathering information to protect Americans from terrorism, and have prompted numerous lawsuits. \n",
      "Last week, a federal judge ruled that the NSA’s collection of phone call records is lawful, while another judge earlier in December questioned the program’s constitutionality. The issue is now more likely to move before the U.S. Supreme Court. \n",
      "Snowden’s Russian amnesty is due to expire in August. He could face at least 30 years in prison over current charges but is more likely to face up to life in prison, the Times said. \n",
      "NSA’s incoming deputy director, Rick Ledgett, recently told CBS News he would favor negotiating an amnesty with Snowden in exchange for securing the documents in his possession, but the White House has dismissed that suggestion. \n",
      "The New York Times editorial board said Snowden “was clearly justified” in his leaks given that current whistleblower laws do not cover private contractors. \n",
      "The editorial listed several ways the NSA had violated the public trust, saying it broke federal privacy laws “thousands of times a year,” undermined the Internet’s basic encryption system and breached the communications links of data centers around the world. \n",
      "Obama, who has called on Snowden to return to the United States, should instead give him “an incentive to return home,” it said. \n",
      "“When someone reveals that government officials have routinely and deliberately broken the law, that person should not face life in prison at the hands of the same government,” the newspaper wrote. \n",

      "(Reuters) - This year’s Masters could make the difference between Tiger Woods winning several more major titles or perhaps ending his career stuck on his current tally of 14, according to Hall of Fame golfer Johnny Miller. \n",
      "Woods, comfortably the greatest player of his generation and possibly of all time, is ideally suited to Augusta National where he has piled up four Masters victories on heavily contoured and slick greens that demand a brilliant short game. \n",
      "However, his barren title run in the majors is now fast approaching six years and the aura of dominance he once enjoyed in golf’s blue riband events is a fading memory, with the young guns of today holding no fear for the world number one. \n",
      "“What he does at Augusta is really important,” twice major winner Miller, 66, said on a Golf Channel conference call ahead of this week’s Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii, the first PGA Tour event of the year. \n",
      "“If he were to win at Augusta, I’d almost bet you he’d win another major this year. He’d win two majors. But if he doesn’t win at Augusta, I think the odds of him winning another one are not that great. \n",
      "“I wouldn’t bet against him, but he’s just a different player than he was when he was younger, even though he won five times (on the PGA Tour) last year.” \n",
      "Woods has not clinched a major title since his remarkable playoff victory in the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, often losing momentum over the weekend after playing his way into contention. His most recent Masters win came in 2005. \n",
      "“In the majors, he seems to be a little bit prone to getting nervous,” said Miller, who became the first player to shoot below 64 in a major championship when he closed with a 63 to win the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont. \n",
      "“You never would say that (before) about Tiger ... he wanted it so badly, he had that desire and dream when he was young, and he looked like he was a shoo-in because he would get 18, 19, 20 majors. \n",
      "“And now after five years, he’s like, ‘Dang, those are hard to get.’ It’s almost a second career he’s going after now. He had this unbelievable first career when it comes to the majors.” \n",
      "Woods has posted nine top-10s in the majors since the 2008 U.S. Open, including a runner-up spot at the 2009 PGA Championship where he was overhauled by South Korea’s Yang Yong-eun in the final round. \n",
      "In Miller’s opinion, Woods has suffered in part because of his own poor record over the weekend at the majors and also because of the greater confidence now shown by his challengers down the stretch. \n",
      "“The stuff he’s doing on the weekend, I’m sure he’s very concerned,” said Miller. “Last year, he was so great on Thursday and Friday with a 68.97 (average) in the first two rounds, and then on the weekend he’s 70.80. \n",
      "“He’s got a double whammy in that he’s not able to close as well as he used to, and then the guys (his rivals) are more heroic against him like they never were before. \n",
      "“It’s really much, much harder for him because guys are just saying, ‘Yeah, you’re Tiger Woods and you’re the greatest ever, but now at your age, I can beat you.’ He needs to do it in the majors.” \n",

      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street brokerages that hire stockbrokers who have a track record of misconduct should expect to show examiners how they will curb future wrongdoing, the industry’s watchdog said on Thursday in an overview of issues it will review in 2014. \n",
      "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) will review the process that firms use to research problem brokers before hiring them, FINRA said. The industry-funded watchdog also wants to know whether the firms take extra measures to supervise the brokers to prevent future misdeeds, such as sales abuses involving client accounts. \n",
      "FINRA, which routinely examines the industry’s nearly 4,200 securities firms to gauge their compliance with securities industry rules, published its annual list of “examination priorities” on Thursday. The regulator also oversees the industry’s 636,200 brokers. \n",
      "Only a “small number” of brokers have engage in a pattern of misbehavior that could harm investors, FINRA said. \n",
      "The regulator is also honing in on potential risks posed by brokers who worked at firms that were expelled from the securities industry, FINRA said. Many of the brokers are not barred because of their firms’ wrongdoing and find work at other firms. They may, however, bring “unethical or illegal practices” with them, FINRA said. The regulator is identifying and monitoring the firms and individuals, it said. \n",
      "FINRA’s heightened scrutiny of problem brokers during its upcoming examinations follows a program it launched in 2013 to fast-track investigations and disciplinary cases involving risky brokers who may pose the greatest threats to investors.\n",

      "By Richard Leong, Andy Bruce and Aileen Wang \n",
      "NEW YORK/LONDON/BEIJING, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Global manufacturing ended 2013 on a strong note, as major  exporters like the United States, Japan and Germany all saw demand pick up, although China’s performance remained modest, surveys showed on Thursday. \n",
      "Years of loose monetary policy, along with soaring stock markets, appear to be bolstering economic confidence. That bodes well for a global economy that has struggled to shake off the effects of financial crisis and recession. \n",
      "China’s growth rate fell to a three-month low, though the index was still above the 50 mark that indicates expansion. Weakness in global equity markets was blamed in part on the Chinese data, though markets were also taking a breather from recent gains. \n",
      "U.S. manufacturing activity grew in December at its swiftest pace in 11 months and the rate of job growth was the strongest since March, according to Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index. \n",
      "Other U.S. economic figures, including construction spending and the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ survey, also pointed to steady gains in the world’s largest economy. \n",
      "“We have had a whole string of strong ISM numbers. This is a gauge of sentiment and sentiment is improving,” said Scott Brown, chief economist with Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. \n",
      "“Europe has turned the corner. It’s not contracting at least. The emerging markets are doing better. We are looking for growth to pick up once again in the new year and we have few headwinds to deal with, especially less fiscal drag.” \n",
      "The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing PMI index dipped slightly to 57 from 57.3 in November, but that’s still well above the 50 level that indicates growth in the sector. Construction spending rose 1 percent to a four-and-a-half-year high. \n",
      "A Reuters poll of economists taken in mid-December forecasts annualized first-quarter economic growth of 2.5 percent, reaching 3 percent by year-end. Since then, economic data has tended to exceed forecasts. \n",
      "U.S. stock markets have been on a tear, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve eases off on its monthly stimulus. The S&P; 500 benchmark closed at all-time highs on Tuesday, even though equities dipped modestly on Thursday. \n",
      "Factory sentiment hit a 10-month high in Mexico, with the HSBC Mexico Manufacturing PMI rising to 52.6 in December, thanks to improved new orders and output. \n",
      "Euro zone manufacturing grew at the fastest rate since mid- 2011 in December on brisk business in Germany and Italy, Markit Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs) showed. Add in the fastest growth in 7 1/2 years for Japanese manufacturing and no major slowdown in Chinese manufacturing output, and the stage is set for a solid start to the year. \n",
      "“Looking ahead, the hope for the euro zone is that recent improved confidence will encourage businesses to lift their employment and investment plans as 2014 progresses, and will also encourage consumers to spend more,” said Howard Archer, the chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight. \n",
      "Markit’s U.S. manufacturing index rose to 55 in December from a final reading of 54.7 in November, above the 50 threshold that indicates growth. \n",
      "Markit’s euro zone manufacturing PMI rose to 52.7 in December from 51.6 in November. \n",
      "While business is showing signs of life, unemployment in many euro zone countries, particularly among young people, remains high. However, the PMIs showed almost two years of job cuts across euro zone factories nearly ended last month. \n",
      "Manufacturing appears to reviving in several euro zone countries that have struggled since the sovereign debt crisis broke out more than four years ago, with gains in Spain, Ireland and even Greece. \n",
      "In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, manufacturing grew at its fastest pace since mid-2011, with its PMI rising to 54.3 from 52.7. The Dutch posted their fastest rate in more than two years. \n",
      "But the euro zone’s No. 2 economy, France, is still lagging. Its PMI fell sharply to 47.0 from 48.4, a seven-month low, marking faster contraction as the year drew to a close. \n",
      "Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, noted that euro zone manufacturers have begun raising prices, suggesting some strengthening in almost non-existent pricing power. \n",
      "“It seems likely that the manufacturing sector will help drive a meaningful, albeit still modest, recovery in the wider economy,” Williamson said. \n",
      "In Britain, which in the last several months has been outperforming the euro economies, the manufacturing PMI unexpectedly slipped to 57.3 from 58.1. Even so, manufacturing output probably grew by 1 percent in the fourth quarter alone, according to Markit. \n",
      "In Asia, performance was a bit more mixed. Already lacklustre output slowed in India, owing mainly to weak  domestic demand. But orders from abroad picked up. \n",
      "“The most striking feature of today’s PMIs was the rise in the output component recorded everywhere but India,” wrote Krystal Tan, Asia economist at consultancy Capital Economics. \n",
      "The HSBC/Markit PMI for China slipped to a three-month low of 50.5 in December, consistent with a dip in the official government PMI to a four-month low of 51.0. \n",
      "Capital Economics’ Tan noted that new orders growth in  Asia, while not as strong as output, was better for most economies than it was just a few months ago. \n",
      "“This fits with our view that the region’s manufacturing sectors are on a gradual road to recovery, supported by loose monetary policy and strengthening external demand.” \n",
      "The PMIs for South Korea and Indonesia, important emerging economies in Asia, both rose in December but remained at relatively low levels.

      "Private forecaster MDA Weather Services called for cold, stormy weather to continue in the 1- to 5-day range, but moderated temperatures are expected in the 6- to 10-day range, followed by strong warmth in the East in the 11- to 15-day forecast. \n",

      "Gas on the Transco pipeline at the New York citygate E-TSCO6NY-IDX jumped $15.72 to $31.12 as cold temperatures and a winter storm expected to hit the northeast region Thursday night caused some pipelines to reach capacity. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) has converted much of its debt in building products company USG Corp (USG.N) into more than $600 million of common stock in a successful investment made in the wake of the financial crisis. \n",
      "According to regulatory filings on Tuesday and Thursday, Berkshire acquired 21.39 million USG shares last month by exchanging $243.8 million of convertible notes it held in Chicago-based USG. \n",
      "That boosted its USG stake to 38.46 million shares, or more than 27 percent, worth $1.09 billion as of Tuesday’s close. \n",
      "The stake makes Berkshire the largest shareholder of USG. It could rise above 30 percent if Berkshire was to swap its remaining $56.2 million of USG notes, a filing shows. \n",
      "Shares of USG rose 0.7 percent to $28.60 on Thursday. \n",
      "A USG spokesman declined to comment on Berkshire’s stake. He said USG has roughly 139 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis following last month’s redemption. \n",
      "Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, and Canada’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH.TO) in late 2008 acquired $400 million of USG convertible senior notes in a private placement. \n",
      "With that deal and others in the same time period, Berkshire gained a reputation as a lender of last resort when financial markets come under strain. \n",
      "The USG notes had a 10 percent interest rate, the same that Berkshire got when it invested $8 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N). \n",
      "Berkshire also bought $300 million of senior notes with a 15 percent rate from motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N). \n",
      "USG last month redeemed $325 million of the notes at a premium, and Berkshire exercised its right to swap its securities into USG common stock at just $11.40 per share. \n",
      "As of September 30, Berkshire held 15.7 percent of USG’s common stock, regulatory filings show. That percentage reflects USG’s lower number of shares outstanding at the time. \n",

      "FRANKFURT, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Bayer suffered a setback in its home market of Germany on Thursday when a healthcare cost watchdog said it was unable to assess whether its new eye medication Eylea offered an advantage over a rival product from Novartis. \n",
      "The opinion issued by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, or IQWiG, could affect the level of reimbursement by public insurers for Eylea in Germany. \n",
      "IQWiG compared trial data on Eylea and Novartis’s Lucentis for treatment of macular edema - a build-up of fluid under the centre of the retina following a blockage of the retina’s major vein. \n",
      "It said it was unable to assess whether Eylea was more effective than Lucentis, which is sold by Roche in the United States and by Novartis elsewhere, because in the trials neither drug was being administered in the way specified by regulators when it was approved for use in Germany. \n",
      "IQWiG’s opinions are taken into account by Germany’s medical cost-benefit agency G-BA, which is due to publish an assessment of Eylea’s cost-effectiveness within the next three months. Bayer said it would respond to IQWiG’s statement within three weeks. \n",
      "Bayer has said it expects Eylea, also known as VEGF Trap-Eye, to generate more than 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in peak annual sales. Bayer HealthCare and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals are collaborating in Eylea’s development. \n",
      "IQWiG also said Bayer’s cancer treatment Stivarga, another potential blockbuster drug, had advantages over alternative treatment, albeit minor ones. \n",
      "While trials did show that Stivarga helped cancer patients live longer, the treatment also carried frequent, severe side-effects, it said.\n",

      "Chinese balloonist lands in midst of isle dispute with Japan\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "TOKYO (Reuters) - A Chinese man landed himself, literally, in the midst of a territorial dispute between Asia’s two great powers, crash-landing a hot air balloon near contested islands held by Japan. \n",
      "The Japanese coastguard said on Thursday it had rescued the balloonist, identified as 35-year-old-chef Xu Shuaijun, on Wednesday in the sea near the tiny isles, called the Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China. \n",
      "The man’s attempt to land his multicolored balloon on the rocky outcrops looks unlikely to have big repercussions for the two countries, as a coastguard spokesman said Japan handed him over to a Chinese patrol vessel on Wednesday evening and Japan’s coastguard was operating as normal. \n",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang described the man as a “balloon enthusiast”, and confirmed he had been handed over to a Chinese vessel upon being rescued and was in good health. He declined further comment. \n",
      "Xu’s adventure comes amid high tension over the disputed territory between the world’s second- and third-biggest economies. \n",
      "Both sides have been repeatedly scrambling fighter jets against perceived threats, raising fear that a miscalculation could lead to conflict, which in turn could draw in Japan’s treaty ally, the United States. \n",
      "On the day Xu, identified as a native of Hebei province, was fished out of the water 22 km (14 miles) south of Uotsuri island, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reiterated his commitment to a stronger military and to revising the pacifist constitution. \n",
      "“Japan will play an even more proactive role than ever before for world peace and stability,” Abe said in a New Year’s message. “We will fully defend the lives and assets of our nationals as well as our territory, territorial waters and territorial airspace in a resolute manner.” \n",
      "Abe was sticking to his guns in the face of strong criticism from China and South Korea, and even a rare rebuke from the United States, over his visit a week ago to a shrine seen by critics as a symbol of Tokyo’s wartime aggression. \n",
      "Rubbing salt into the wound, Japan’s Internal Affairs Minister Yoshitaka Shindo on Wednesday also visited Yasukuni Shrine, where Japanese leaders convicted by the allies as war criminals are among the millions of enshrined war dead. \n",
      "Japan-China tension spiked in late November when Beijing announced an air-defense zone covering a large swathe of the East China Sea, including the disputed isles, demanding that all aircraft flying through the zone identify themselves to Chinese authorities and keep communications open. \n",
      "Japan has urged China to rescind the decision, and its military and civilian aircraft have defied the requirements, flying through the zone without notifying China. The United States refuses to recognize the zone and has sent military aircraft through it. \n",
      "Abe’s announcement last month of more muscular defenses and security policies and his reversal of years of declines in military spending have also angered China. \n",
      "China’s “air-defense identification zone” may not, in fact, have been the bombshell it originally seemed. \n",
      "Japan’s Mainichi newspaper said on Wednesday senior Chinese navy officials briefed Japanese government officials on plans for an air-defense zone almost four years ago. \n",
      "Secret minutes of an informal May 2010 meeting at a think-tank in Beijing show that senior Chinese officers discussed the planned zone with Japanese officials, suggesting the two countries work out rules to avoid a conflict in overlapping air zones, the newspaper said. \n",
      "The report did not indicate whether the early plan included the most contentious element of China’s recent announcement: that aircraft must identify themselves even if they are not headed for China’s territorial airspace. \n",
      "China’s Defense Ministry, in statement faxed to Reuters, said that attendees at the think-tank meeting were military experts and did not represent any official position. \n",
      "It said China informed Japan of the air zone plan shortly before it was formally announced on November 23 last year. \n",
      "Japanese Foreign Ministry officials could not immediately be reached. \n",

      "4 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Shares of Whiting Petroleum Corp , Continental Resources Inc and other top crude oil producers in the Bakken shale formation plunged on Thursday after the U.S. government said oil produced there may be extra flammable. \n",
      "The warning came three days after a BNSF train carrying crude oil collided in eastern North Dakota with another train carrying grain. The resulting explosion led to the temporary evacuation of a nearby town and added to the growing  concern about the safety of oil-by-rail shipments. \n",
      "Last July a runaway oil train, which originated in North Dakota, derailed and exploded in a small Quebec town, killing 47 people. \n",
      "Oil extracted from the Bakken, a vast rock formation underneath North Dakota and Montana, “may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil,” the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, said on Thursday. \n",
      "Whiting & Continental, the largest Bakken producers, saw their shares fall more than 3.5 percent after the announcement. Shares of Oasis Petroleum Inc, Kodiak Oil & Gas Corp  and Northern Oil & Gas Inc saw similar drops. \n",
      "Crude oil prices also fell, contributing to the decline. \n",
      "The U.S. government’s warning should come as no surprise considering refineries and other oil buyers value the high energy content of Bakken crude oil, said Ron Ness, the head of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, a trade group for oil producers. \n",
      "“I don’t think there’s any surprise that Bakken crude oil is the highest quality crude oil available and it has more of those high-end components that you’re looking for in a top-shelf crude oil,” Ness said. \n",
      "Ness said Whiting and other producers he represents follow current federal standards for oil-by-rail shipment. He said the U.S. government should consider updating transportation regulations that currently put crude oil in the same category as ammonia and other chemicals for safety standards. \n",
      "Oil producers are not responsible for their product once it is loaded onto railcars, a process that typically comes as sale of the oil is finalized. Logistics companies often buy oil from producers and arrange to have it shipped via rail or other means, before selling it to the end user. \n",
      "The oil involved in the Monday crash was loaded onto the train in Fryburg, North Dakota, and was headed nearly 1,300 miles (2,092 km) to Hayti, Missouri. \n",
      "Sources familiar with the loading operations told Reuters on Tuesday that Houston-based logistics company Great Northern Midstream loaded the crude at Fryburg, and it was to be unloaded at Marquis Energy’s storage terminal and barge loading facility at Hayti, along the Mississippi River. \n",
      "“When the train leaves the station, (the oil) is in someone else’s hands,” Ness said. \n",
      "The American Association of Railroads (AAR), an industry trade group for BNSF and others, said it has worked with federal regulators to try and increase railcar design standards and other regulations. Railways do not inspect material they ship, and simply transport it from one location to another. \n",
      "A member of the National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday that railcars involved in the crash were all older types that do not meet the latest industry safety standards.\n",

      "“The club was busy with New Year revelers. Three people appeared from the other side of the road and threw a grenade at the night club which (the grenade) exploded injuring 10 people. The attackers escaped on a motor bike,” Jack Ekakuro, Kwale area police chief told journalists at the scene. \n",

      "Scientists, tourists rescued from Antarctic ship begin long journey home\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "SYDNEY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - An Australian icebreaker with 52 passengers rescued from a Russian ship trapped in Antarctic ice since Christmas Eve began the long journey home on Friday. \n",
      "“The passengers seem very glad to now be with us and they are settling in to their new accommodation,” Jason Mundy, Australian Antarctic Division Acting Director who is on board the ice breaker Aurora Australis, said on Friday morning. \n",
      "A helicopter from the Chinese icebreaker Snow Dragon ferried the 52 scientists and tourists in small groups from the ice-bound Akademik Shokalskiy and transferred them to the Antarctic supply ship Aurora Australis late on Thursday. \n",
      "The Aurora Australis is now sailing towards open water and will then head towards an Antarctic base to complete a resupply before returning to Australia. \n",
      "Passengers, mostly Australians and New Zealanders, will probably arrive in Australia’s southern island state of Tasmania around mid-January. The Russian crew on the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay onboard until the ice breaks up and frees the ship. \n",
      "The rescue, repeatedly delayed due to weather and ice conditions, kicked off late on Thursday afternoon and took around five hours to complete. \n",
      "Chris Turney, who led the private expedition, documented the rescue mission from the stranded ship with regular posts depicting videos and photographs. \n",
      "“The first of the helicopters to take us home! Thanks everyone!” Turney and another passenger said cheerfully in a short video clip when the helicopter arrived to take the first group of 12 people. \n",
      "Photographs showed passengers bundled in heavy parka jackets, snow goggles and hats, boarding a helicopter amid a backdrop of snowdrifts and clear blue skies - a big change from the cloud, howling gales and slow flurries that had prevented earlier rescue attempts. \n",
      "“We’ve made it to the Aurora Australis safe & sound,” Turney said on Twitter late on Thursday. \n",
      "Mundy said there were enough rooms on the Aurora Australis for these passengers, and the ship can “look after them well for the final part of their journey”. \n",
      "The Russian-owned research ship left New Zealand on Nov. 28 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of an Antarctic journey led by famed Australian explorer Douglas Mawson. \n",
      "It became trapped on Dec. 24, 100 nautical miles east of French Antarctic station Dumont D’Urville and about 1,500 nautical miles south of Australia’s southern island state of Tasmania. \n",
      "During their time on the ice, passengers amused themselves with movies, classes in knot tying, languages, yoga and photography, and rung in the New Year with dinner, drinks and new song composed about their adventure. \n",
      "The Chinese ship Snow Dragon got within sight of the Akademik Shokalskiy on Saturday, but turned back after failing to break through the ice, which was more than 3 metres (10 feet) thick in some place. \n",
      "The Aurora Australis and another French flagged ship also tried to help but failed to reach the ship because of strong winds and heavy snow.       (Additional reporting by Lincoln Feast in Sydney and Susan Heavey in Washington; Editing by Michael Perry)\n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to consider legislation to make data on the Obamacare website more secure when lawmakers return to Washington next week, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said on Thursday. \n",
      "In a memo to his fellow House Republicans, Cantor said he would schedule floor action next week on proposals to make the healthcare website safer as well as notify consumers when their personal information has been compromised. \n",
      "Cantor noted that several bills on the topic of the website’s security had already been introduced by Republicans. \n",
      "The website HealthCare.gov allows consumers to shop for insurance plans under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which passed in 2010 and mandated that Americans have health insurance. It also created new marketplaces to buy insurance plans. \n",
      "The website collects personal data such as names, birth dates, email addresses and other information that criminals could use for a variety of scams. \n",
      "The portal was bedeviled by technical glitches after its October 1 launch. But in recent weeks its performance has improved, and the administration announced on Tuesday that more than 2 million people already had enrolled in private health insurance plans offered under the law, which is popularly called Obamacare. \n",
      "Some technology experts warned Congress in November that the Obamacare website had so many security flaws that it was putting people’s data at risk and should be shut down until it is fixed. \n",
      "An administration spokesman responding to Cantor’s memo said Thursday that security on the website was a top priority and was protected by stringent standards as well as ongoing testing. \n",
      "“To date, there have been no successful security attacks on HealthCare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site,” Aaron Albright, a spokesman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, which was in charge of launching HealthCare.gov. \n",
      "House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that Republicans appeared intent on undermining the Affordable Care Act - even if it meant “scaring their constituents from obtaining health coverage.” \n",
      "Cantor said that in the coming weeks the House of Representatives would also address other areas where he said greater transparency is needed on Obama’s healthcare program, “including the disclosure of reliable and complete enrollment data.” \n",

      "Gas problem may have led to deadly blast in Minneapolis -fire chief\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Investigators are looking at a gas leak as a potential cause for an explosion and fire that gutted a Minneapolis apartment building on New Year’s Day, killing at least one person and injuring 14 others, officials said on Thursday. \n",
      "The cause of the explosion and fire in the three-story building that had a grocery store on the ground floor and 10 apartments remained undetermined, but witnesses have told investigators they smelled gas before the blast, Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel told a news conference. \n",
      "Fire officials said a body was found on Thursday in the structure after crews began the slow process of removing debris. Two people were unaccounted for, officials said. \n",
      "Investigators believe the explosion happened on the second or third floor. Fire officials added that it could take weeks to determine a cause and it is possible that a cause for the explosion and fire might never be found. \n",
      "“We are sort of focusing more on the issue of a potential gas-type scenario,” Fruetel said, adding that witnesses had reported gas-like odors like when a pilot light on a gas stove goes out, or other natural gas-like smells. \n",
      "The multiple reports of those types of smells have led investigators to focus in that direction for a cause of the explosion and fire, Fruetel said. \n",
      "CenterPoint Energy spokeswoman Rebecca Virden said no gas odors or leaks were detected on CenterPoint’s distribution system in the area, which is fairly new. \n",
      "The building was built in 1886 and was in an ethnic community of mainly Somali immigrants near the West Bank campus of the University of Minnesota. The roof and upper floors collapsed leaving unstable ice-caked exterior walls and rubble. \n",
      "Fourteen people were transported to hospitals after the fire. \n",
      "On Thursday, three people were in critical condition and six in satisfactory condition at Hennepin County Medical Center. One person was in serious condition and one in good condition at University of Minnesota Medical Center Fairview. \n",
      "Building occupants were seen leaping or falling from the windows after the explosion and rescue crews said flames shot 20 feet (6 meters) above the windows. \n",
      "Firefighters were forced to withdraw from the building and battle the blaze from the exterior because of the heavy flames and concerns the structure could collapse.   (Reporting by David Bailey; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)\n",

      "Daily routines may influence sleep quality, quantity\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Maintaining a consistent daily routine may be linked to better sleep, according to a small new study. \n",
      "Young adults who went to work and ate dinner around the same time every day typically slept better and woke up fewer times during the night. They also fell asleep more quickly at bedtime. \n",
      "Yet the exact time people performed daily activities - say, eating dinner at 6 p.m. versus 8 p.m. - had little bearing on how well they slept. \n",
      "“For the majority of sleep outcomes, we found that completing activities at a regular time better predicted sleep outcomes than the actual time of day that activities were completed,” Natalie Dautovich, a psychologist at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, said. She led the study, which was published in the Journals of Gerontology: Series B. \n",
      "“For example, people reported better sleep quality and fewer awakenings at night when they were consistent in the time they first went outside,” Dautovich told Reuters Health in an email. \n",
      "On the other hand, for older adults, inconsistent daily schedules were sometimes linked with better sleep, the researchers found. \n",
      "For instance, older people whose dinnertime varied tended to sleep longer at night. And those who started home activities or began work at different times each day fell asleep more quickly. \n",
      "The study included 50 adults between the ages of 18 and 30 and another 50 between 60 and 95. Participants kept a diary of when they performed regular activities and how well they slept at night for two weeks. \n",
      "Instead of opening the door to new recommendations or sleep treatments, the authors said the study best serves to create questions for future research. \n",
      "Those questions include whether older adults who have more variation in their daily schedules are already healthier and more socially active - or whether it’s the variety in one’s everyday schedule that provides the activity and stimulation that help ensure good sleep, according to Dautovich. \n",
      "“We know that good sleep at night is dependent in part on our drive to sleep, which is based on how active and alert we are during the day,” she said. \n",
      "For that reason, being out and about during the day remains one of the best ways to maximize the chances of a solid night of shut-eye. \n",
      "“Greater activity and levels of alertness during the day increase our need to sleep at night,” Dautovich said. \n",

      "Egypt questions Vodafone over bomb code advert\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian state security prosecutors are questioning the makers of a commercial for Vodafone Egypt after a little-known rap singer alleged the ad included coded signals for bomb attacks by the Muslim Brotherhood. \n",
      "The Egyptian unit of Vodafone, the world’s biggest mobile operator by revenue, rejected the suggestions. \n",
      "In a statement sent to Reuters on Thursday, it said the ad posted on YouTube and social media channels and featuring a well-known puppet character was meant to promote a special offer for customers to re-activate their old SIM cards and had no hidden meaning. \n",
      "Any other explanations “are pure fiction and personal opinions” for which the company is not responsible, it added, suggesting it might take legal action “against whomever (is) trying to distort the company’s reputation”. \n",
      "The preliminary investigation was launched following a complaint by 25 year-old rapper Ahmed Spider, security and judiciary sources said. \n",
      "Spider told the private Al-Tahrir TV channel in an interview that baubles on a Christmas tree featured in the commercial represented bombs. \n",
      "He said the tree’s branches mimicked the four-finger gesture used to symbolize the raid by security forces on August 14 last year that killed hundreds of supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi who were camped out in Cairo. \n",
      "Security sources said the singer was known to be an anti-Islamist and a supporter of the army that last July removed elected president Mursi after protests against his rule. \n",
      "The government has designated Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and accused it of carrying out a suicide bomb attack last week on a police compound in Nile Delta in which 16 people were killed. The Brotherhood, long Egypt’s main political opposition force, has denied any links to the attack. \n",
      "The ad shows Egyptian puppet character Abla Fahita and her daughter Karkoura desperately searching for her deceased father’s SIM card. Speaking on the phone with a friend called “Mama Touta”, Fahita says she asked for the sniffer dog of a shopping mall to search for the missing card. \n",
      "Spider said the mall and the dog were code words for the planned sites of a coming attack. \n",
      "“Abla Fahita is a comic character, used in this ad as a tool to clarify the offer to viewers/customers, in a comic and sarcastic context,” Vodafone said in its statement. \n",
      "“The ad is only a marketing communication tool. It does not carry any hidden messages or meanings other than what has been mentioned above.” \n",
      "Company spokesman Khaled Hegazy had earlier said that employees from Vodafone Egypt’s marketing and legal departments had been asked about who made the commercial. \n",
      "“We are very sad that there are people who think in this way in Egypt,” said Hegazy, voicing concern that a top state prosecutor had taken seriously the suggestion that a phone company’s ad was promoting terrorism. \n",
      "Vodafone Egypt, one of three mobile network operators in the country, is about 55 percent owned by Britain’s Vodafone and around 45 percent by state-owned landline monopoly Telecom Egypt. \n",
      "The case triggered satirical comment on social media. \n",
      "“Egypt security: If somebody sees or knows where Abla Fahita, the Muslim Brotherhood terrorist puppet, is hiding contact our Muslim Brotherhood hotline,” a tweet under the name of arab resistance read. \n",
      "Another tweet by Iyad El-Baghdadi said: “Forget the four-finger sign, Abla Fahita should become the symbol of resistance to Egypt’s new regime.” \n",

      "South Korea military to fight to keep ban on sex by academy cadets\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s military said on Thursday it would fight a court ruling quashing its move to kick an officer candidate out of the elite Army Academy for having sex with his girlfriend while on leave. \n",
      "An appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Academy abused its authority to discipline cadets when it expelled a candidate for having sex with his girlfriend while on a weekend leave. It ruled that his conduct did no harm to the institution’s honor. \n",
      "The Academy maintains rules against sexual relations as part of its code of conduct that also bans drinking, smoking and marriage and it intends to take the case to the Supreme Court, a spokesman for the Army told a news briefing. \n",
      "News reports said a third person had observed the recruit and his girlfriend visiting an apartment and had informed the Academy. \n",
      "The Academy is an elite institution that educates officers for a country that has a long history of military men playing an active role in politics. Two of its graduates have gone on to become president. \n",
      "It has faced criticism that its rules, dating from 1952, are unrealistic in today’s liberal society. But it says it plans to tighten scrutiny of personal ethics when reviewing candidates for 310 cadets it is recruiting this year. \n",
      "In 2008, the National Human Rights Commission issued a non-binding recommendation that the Defense Ministry upgrade the code of conduct as some rules may infringe basic human rights. \n",
      "Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok conceded the Academy may have to change the rules to “better reflect the times” if the Supreme Court upholds the lower court ruling that expulsion for having sex was excessive. \n",

      "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq has arrested an Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia leader whose group claimed responsibility for a mortar bomb attack near a border post in Saudi Arabia in November, police sources said on Thursday. \n",
      "Wathiq al-Batat, commander of Iraq’s al-Mukhtar Army militia, was arrested at a check point in northeastern Baghdad, a police source told Reuters. \n",
      "The Al-Mukhtar Army is a relatively new Shi’ite militia, which has said it is supported and funded by Iran. Batat is a former leader of Iraq’s better known Kata’ib Hezbollah militia. \n",
      "Batat said his militia was behind the six mortar bombs that landed near the border post in northern Saudi Arabia on November 21. There were no casualties, but the attack was a warning to the kingdom to stop meddling in Iraqi affairs, he told Reuters. \n",
      "Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia has had tense relations with the Shi’ite-led Iraqi government, which it views as a pawn of Iran. It has not had an ambassador based in Baghdad since before the 1990-91 Gulf war. \n",
      "Sectarian fighting in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 has involved Sunni militants close to al Qaeda as well as Shi’ite militias which have no love for Saudi Arabia. \n",

      "As of 0200 GMT, the main TAIEX index had shed 54.69 points to 8557.85, after closing flat on Thursday. \n",
      "Electronics and semiconductors dropped 0.79 and 1.33 percent, respectively. Wells Fargo downgraded the stock of consumer electronics powerhouse Apple Inc  . Taiwan is a major supplier and manufacturer of Apple products. \n",

      "3 Min Read\n",
      "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own. \n",
      "Feeling insecure? So are companies everywhere. The lesson of 2013 was that there are grievous flaws in security systems once thought virtually impenetrable. Business needs better protection. The most credible providers may be smaller tech players. \n",
      "Governments from the United States to China have embraced online surveillance and regulation. That won’t end in 2014: paranoia is rising, and besides, spying between countries isn’t technically illegal. Corporate spying has increased too, particularly as cloud-based services introduce new vulnerabilities. Detected attacks were up 25 percent year on year in 2013, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers corporate survey. Half of respondents say security spending over the next 12 months will increase. \n",
      "But whom to trust? Market leaders are suspect. The likes of IBM and Cisco Systems are seen as facilitating U.S. state surveillance, and have suffered a sharp drop-off in revenues, led by clients in overseas markets like China and Russia. Other deep-pocketed giants such as Deutsche Telekom and Huawei want to offer alternatives, but they may also appear compromised. Deutsche Telekom’s SiMKo secure phone and tablet technologies are undermined by its state ownership. Privately owned Chinese group Huawei is at pains to deny it has connections to the military and can be pushed around by the state. \n",
      "Where smaller specialists excel is in perceived neutrality. Privately owned Silent Circle has grown its subscriber base by around 400 percent since the second quarter of 2012: the company showed its anti-surveillance cred by closing its email unit as a pre-emptive measure to protect client data in the wake of the NSA revelations. It’s hard to imagine Google or Yahoo taking such extreme measures to show their independence. \n",
      "There are relatively few ways to invest in the sector, but scarcity only incites keener interest. Barracuda, which provides security and data storage products, debuted on the New York stock market in November with a 32 percent first-day share price pop. Shares in malware protection firm FireEye and cloud security company Qualys have both risen 90 percent since they floated in September. \n",
      "This may not last forever. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers thinks the giants will regain trust and market share – though it could take time. But for now, “small tech” will be best placed to take Big Brother down a peg. \n",

      "BRISBANE (Reuters) - Perhaps unsurprisingly, Serena Williams has a clear memory of the moment her on-court rivalry with Maria Sharapova swung in her favor, leading to one-way domination for the last eight years. \n",
      "After losing to Williams in their first meeting in Miami in 2004, the Russian went on win finals against the American at Wimbledon, claiming her first grand slam title, and in the Tour Championships of that year. \n",
      "Then, in an epic 2005 Australian Open semi-finals clash, Sharapova had three match points. \n",
      "“I remember a forehand inside out,” Williams said. “I was down match point and I hit this winner and I didn’t even blink. \n",
      "“I hit the a winner and walked right to the other side and was ready for the next return as if it was just a 30-15 point.” \n",
      "Williams went on to win the match 2-6 7-5 8-6 and since then has improved their head-to-head record to 14-2 in her favor. \n",
      "These wins have included the finals of the 2007 Australian Open, 2012 Olympics and the last time they met at Roland Garros seven month ago. \n",
      "Sharapova claimed to have no memory of the match at Rod Laver Arena eight years ago. \n",
      "“2005? Oh, my God, I can’t go back that far,” Sharapova said. \n",
      "“I don’t have too much time to look back at ‘04. I have a lot of things going on in my life. \n",
      "“Some of the matches were a bit closer than others. When you go out on the court in a new time, you can’t really rely on everything that happened in the past. You’ve got to start from scratch from the first point. \n",
      "“Of course I know I’ve tried and I didn’t succeed in the last many times that I’ve played her, but I’m setting up an opportunity to go out there and try to change that, and I’m going to try to do that.” \n",

      "BERLIN (Reuters) - The number of people in employment in Europe’s biggest economy hit a record high for the seventh consecutive year in 2013, although the increase was smaller than in the last two years, Germany’s Statistics Office said on Thursday. \n",
      "With 41.8 million people in work, some 232,000 jobs were created last year but the rise was roughly half the size of the average for 2012 and 2011, the office said. \n",
      "Germany’s jobless rate has held steady at just below 7.0 percent for the last two years and is the envy of crisis-hit euro zone partners such as Spain and Greece where more than one in four people is officially out of work. \n",
      "Strong employment data bodes well for domestic demand, on which Berlin is relying to support economic growth this year as the traditionally export-driven economy suffers from a slowdown in some emerging markets and fragile demand from the euro zone. \n",
      "However, some of Germany’s economic institutes have warned that plans by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s new right-left government to introduce a minimum wage may cause long-term job losses. \n",

      "Jan 2 (Reuters) - A blast of winter weather disrupted grain and livestock movement in parts of the U.S. Midwest on Thursday as snowy roads slowed truck deliveries of hogs, corn and other commodities and icy rivers impeded barge shipments of grain bound for export markets. \n",
      "Snow was falling on much of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on Thursday as the storm, which hit the farm belt over the New Year’s holiday, veered toward the northeastern United States. \n",
      "Plunging temperatures in the coming days could prolong the transportation headaches, particularly on the icy Illinois River, where shippers have been working to keep a navigable channel open. \n",
      "“We’re making ice 24 hours a day at these temperatures and it’s only going to get worse with the lows forecast to be way below zero next week,” said a barge broker. \n",
      "“If there weren’t all the boat traffic running up and down the Illinois, I don’t think it would be navigable right now,” he added. \n",
      "The U.S. Coast Guard has already restricted navigation to one-way traffic from Illinois River mile marker 169 to 179 near Peoria, Illinois, because ice has narrowed the shipping channel, a Coast Guard spokesman said. \n",
      "No other ice-related restrictions were currently in place on the Illinois River, which typically remains open to barge traffic through the winter months. \n",
      "Northern sections of the Mississippi River are already closed for the season so export terminals along the Gulf Coast often rely heavily on grain shipments from Illinois and Ohio river elevators during the winter. \n",
      "Some 60 percent of all U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports exit the country via the U.S. Gulf Coast. Gulf exporters rely on barge shipments via the Mississippi River and its tributaries to supply the bulk of their exportable grain. \n",
      "Snow- and ice-covered highways and impassable rural roads limited grain movement from Midwest farms to elevators and processors on Thursday, though grain prices were not affected, grain merchants said. \n",
      "Cash hog brokers in the eastern Corn Belt said cold weather and blowing snow did not halt hog deliveries to slaughter houses but that the trips were taking longer than normal due to hazardous road conditions. \n",

      "By Margaret Chadbourn \n",
      "WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department should either tighten the procedures that it uses to release market-sensitive data to the media or scrap them altogether and distribute the data directly to the public, a watchdog for the department said on Thursday. \n",
      "The recommendation to tighten the so-called lockup process, specifically the department’s weekly jobless claims figures, was included in an audit released by the Labor Department’s Office of Inspector General. The panel was reviewing the process in an effort to prevent the possibility that some investors could have an unfair competitive advantage in buying and selling stocks, bonds and other trading assets. \n",
      "Under the lockup procedure, media outlets are “locked” in a room where they receive embargoed copies of data reports, usually about 30 minutes before the designated release time, and do not have the ability to post stories until the embargo is lifted. \n",
      "The lockups were initiated in the mid-1980s. \n",
      "Government officials are looking to mitigate the crush of high-speed trading systems that have set up systems to retrieve information seconds ahead of the public. High-speed trading has grown significantly in the past decade and is often a key part of some hedge funds’ investment strategies. \n",
      "The lockups allow media outlets to sell data reports to clients, including high-frequency, or algorithmic, trading firms. The firms use computerized trading techniques ahead of individual traders based on the reports. \n",
      "“Algorithmic trading introduces new security variables into a lockup system not originally designed to guard against market-moving distributions that could be caused by the release of government data to certain traders just seconds before the rest of the general public,” the report said. \n",
      "“A few years ago, a few seconds here or there would not have had much of an impact. Today, fractions of a second can equate to millions or even billions of dollars in market movements.” \n",
      "The audit was mainly focused on the Labor Department’s weekly report on jobless claims, but the panel’s recommendations could have a broader impact on how other government agencies consider cracking down on lockups. \n",
      "The lockup process, in which several news outlets participate, covers releases on economic growth, home sales and inflation, among other matters. \n",
      "The report also found that the Employment and Training Administration, which compiles the jobless claim report, had deficiencies in its procedures governing release of the data. \n",
      "The Labor Department said it agrees with some of the issues the audit raised surrounding the efficacy of the lockup process. \n",
      "“We agree with the OIG that it is appropriate to consider ending the weekly claims press lockup,” the Labor Department said in a statement. \n",
      "It said it had already started exploring the value of the press lockup and intends to continue its consideration of how best to disseminate the report to both the public and to news organizations. \n",
      "Many government officials have already considered potential security problems and have tightened procedures this past year to ensure there are not any broken embargoes. \n",
      "Media outlets that take part in the lockups include Bloomberg News, Reuters and the Associated Press. Both Dow Jones and Reuters said they had no comment on the recommendations. Bloomberg and the AP were not immediately available for comment.\n",

      "China produces more than 90 percent of the world’s rare earth metals, a group of 17 elements used in a wide range of applications in sectors like renewable energy, telecommunications and defence. \n",

It has also sought to consolidate miners under the control of a small number of state-owned producers. \n",

      "\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Demand for Ally Financial’s shares has been ramping up, with investors paying increasingly high prices in recent private transactions that signal the U.S. government could be able to sell its remaining stake in the auto lender this year, sources familiar with the situation said. \n",
      "Ally Financial has been hoping to go public since at least 2011. But until now, investors were spooked by the problems that forced it to seek some $17 billion in government bailouts during the financial crisis, including bad home loans at its Residential Capital subprime mortgage unit. \n",
      "As Residential Capital gets ready to emerge from bankruptcy, hedge funds have grown increasingly comfortable that Ally’s problems have cleared up and have bought the company’s shares in two private transactions. The deals signal that the government, which still owns around 64 percent of Ally, may also find good demand for its shares in public markets. \n",
      "Even if it does not, it may be able to sell its shares to private investors, bankers and company executives said. \n",
      "“There might well be enough demand in the private market to take Treasury out in whole,” Ally Chief Executive Michael Carpenter said on a November 5 conference call with analysts. \n",
      "An Ally spokeswoman declined to comment. \n",
      "The U.S. Treasury is open to winding down its remaining investment through an IPO, another private placement or through asset sales, a department spokesman wrote in a December 30 blog post on the Treasury’s website. \n",
      "To be sure, Ally faces headwinds. It is harder for the former General Motors Co lending arm to win business now that it no longer has special agreements to be the preferred lender to customers of Chrysler Group and GM. It has been increasingly relying on used car loans and subprime car loans, which tend to have weaker credit quality, to generate profit growth. \n",
      "The outcome of a few other financial services’ IPOs expected early next year may determine how successful an Ally public offering might be, bankers said. Santander’s U.S. consumer finance business and General Electric Co’s spin-off of its credit card unit will likely come to market early in 2014, and Ally may wait to see how they fare before proceeding with its own IPO, said one industry banker. \n",
      "Private market investors appear to be optimistic about Ally’s prospects. Ally sold $1.3 billion in unlisted shares to private investors in November for an average price of around $6,000 per share, and weeks later GM sold its remaining 8.5 percent stake in Ally for around $6,800 per share. \n",
      "Before the November transaction, Ally had talks with at least one private equity firm about selling shares at a fairly big discount to their book value, a source familiar with the situation said. But hedge funds then unexpectedly bid up the shares, allowing Ally to fetch a valuation closer to its book value, the source said. \n",
      "The hedge funds “opened the flood-gates, and people saying ‘I will write a check for $6,000 a share,” the source said. “There is a subset of investors buying into the notion that there is a brighter future for Ally.” \n",
      "Between the November and December private transactions, a federal judge approved the plan of Residential Capital, which Ally put into bankruptcy in May 2012, to exit Chapter 11 before the end of the year. To many investors, that signaled that the company had cleared up one of its biggest problems. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch raised Ally’s credit rating on the news, contributing to the higher valuation. \n",
      "Ally’s bonds are rallying too - its notes due in 2020, with a 7.5 percent coupon, have risen 5 cents on the dollar to 117 cents on the dollar since August, according to bond reporting system Trace. \n",
      "The company’s profitability should improve as it continues to cut its funding costs, said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. In the third quarter, Ally’s cost of funds fell 0.57 percentage point from a year earlier. \n",
      "Ally received $17.2 billion in bailout money from the United States during the financial crisis, when it was rescued as part of the government’s efforts to save the U.S. auto industry. The government has recovered $12.3 billion of that money as Ally bought back some shares and paid $3.7 billion in dividends and interest. It is one of the biggest remaining investments in the government’s Troubled Asset Recovery Program bailout fund. \n",
      "While Ally has some control over how it ultimately gets out from under the Treasury’s control, the bank cannot determine the precise timing. \n",
      "“The timing and the exact method of exit is completely under (the Treasury’s) control, not under our control,” Ally CEO Carpenter said on the November 5 call. \n",

      "Hyundai, Kia face fading growth as currency tides buoy Japan rivals\n",
      "An Error has occured\n",
      "7 Min Read\n",
      "SEOUL (Reuters) - The man who led South Korea’s auto industry on a tear through the last decade said Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS) expect what will be their lowest annual sales growth since 2003 as the weak yen fires up Japanese rivals. \n",
      "In his annual New Year speech to staff on Thursday, 75-year-old group chairman Chung Mong-koo said sales at Hyundai and its smaller affiliate Kia will likely grow just 4 percent in 2014. Global competition is about to get tougher in an industry facing changing technology and an uncertain future, he warned. \n",
      "The Korean duo exports about two-thirds of its cars from South Korea, a much higher proportion than Japanese peers, making them more vulnerable to currency fluctuations. A weaker yen gives Japanese carmakers like Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) leeway to offer customers better deals in key export markets like the United States - the same advantage that helped Hyundai and Kia after the global financial crisis of 2008. \n",
      "“Competition among companies is intensifying, as the global economy has entered an era of low growth,” Chung said in his traditional New Year address to some 1,000 employees at Hyundai’s Seoul headquarters. “Technological convergence leads to change in the industry, and adds to uncertainty.” \n",
      "On Thursday, the won hit its highest level for more than five years against both the dollar and the yen, prompting talk in Seoul of possible government intervention in currency markets to help exporters. Shares in Hyundai and Kia, ranked fifth in the world by combined global sales, ended down 5.1 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively. \n",
      "The yen’s fall has been stoked by Japan’s attempts to support its export industries and pull its economy out of a two-decade slump. A senior official in South Korea earlier this week expressed concerns that the country’s own exporters could be hurt as a result: auto exports typically account for close to 9 percent of South Korea’s total. \n",
      "Toyota is on course for record profits in the financial year ended March 2014, largely helped by the weaker yen. That trend also helped Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) and Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd (7270.T) become two of the top three performers in the Nikkei stock average in 2013. \n",
      "The year ahead promises to be testing for Chung, more than 10 years into the job leading the company founded by his father. Hyundai has shaken up U.S. management amid a fall in market share there, while a new free trade deal with the European Union means German rivals are encroaching on its once-impregnable domestic stronghold. \n",
      "Hyundai and its affiliate Kia are planning for global sales of a combined 7.86 million vehicles this year, up from 7.56 million in 2013. To achieve that, Chung is counting on growth from revamped versions of key models like the Genesis and Sonata sedans, as well increased production capacity in China. \n",
      "The forecast increase for 2014 would be in line with the global auto market’s projected sales growth of 4 percent, but is the lowest since 2003’s 2.3 percent. It’s also bleak by comparison with breakneck growth at one of the auto industry’s biggest success stories during the global economic downturn at the end of the last decade. \n",
      "At their growth peak in 2010, Hyundai and Kia’s annual sales climbed 24 percent as the weaker Korean won allowed them to offer stylish, feature-loaded new cars at affordable prices. \n",
      "“The yen’s weakness is not welcoming news to Hyundai investors. This may adversely affect its market share and sales,” said Song Sun-jae, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities. \n",
      "However, he said he still expects Hyundai and Kia to sell 8 million vehicles this year, higher than its target, and slightly outperform the global market. “Hyundai and Kia have offered conservative sales targets and beat them in recent years. I expect this year would be no different,” he said. \n",
      "In regulatory filings, Hyundai said it was targeting sales of 4.9 million vehicles this year, while Kia’s goal is to reach 2.96 million. \n",
      "The pair’s 2013 sales did beat the original Hyundai-Kia target of 7.41 million as growth in China and Brazil offset a lackluster showing at home. In South Korea, auto makers like Germany’s Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) have been boosted by a free trade pact between the country and the European Union. \n",
      "But at 6 percent, 2013’s increase was below the previous year’s 8 percent rise, leaving Hyundai-Kia already in their third straight year of declining growth. \n",
      "Hyundai and Kia have increased overseas production over the years. They made 49 percent of their cars in Korea, according to industry data for 2012, the last year for which figures have been released. Of those, however, they still exported 67 percent. \n",
      "By comparison, Honda makes about 20 percent of its cars in Japan, and of those it exports about 20 percent. \n",
      "In recent years, Chung’s focus has been more on managing quality and brand-building than new plants. But the export comparisons have left company watchers wondering whether Hyundai and Kia might announce plans to build new plants in the U.S. or other markets this year. \n",
      "Fuelling those questions, analysts say capacity constraints, along with aging models and rising competition, may have led Hyundai to miss its 2013 sales target for the U.S. Automakers including Hyundai plan to announce U.S. sales on Friday. \n",
      "The task of bolstering Hyundai in the U.S. in a year of crucial new launches now falls to sales head David Zuchowski, who recently replaced John Krafcik as U.S. chief. \n",
      "Kia also plans to start production at its third plant in China early this year, while Hyundai has added capacity of 150,000 vehicles at its third factory in Beijing. \n",

      "2 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors in U.S.-based funds committed $3.45 billion to stock funds in the week ended Wednesday to capitalize on a final stretch of record gains in the U.S. stock market in 2013, data from Thomson Reuters’ Lipper service showed on Thursday. \n",
      "The inflows into stock funds in the week ended January 1 marked the second straight week of new money into the funds. The Standard & Poor’s 500 ended the year at a record high in the holiday-shortened week. \n",
      "Stock exchange-traded funds, which are thought to represent the institutional investor, attracted $3.05 billion in new cash, while stock mutual funds, which are commonly purchased by retail investors, attracted just $406 million. \n",
      "“It was a last play by ETF investors,” said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper. The S&P; 500 rose 29.6 percent for the year, marking its best year since 1997. \n",
      "Taxable bond funds had outflows of $3.3 billion, reversing the prior week’s inflows. Investors sold bonds over the period on data showing improvement in U.S. jobs. Investors also braced for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting back on its $85 billion in monthly bond-buying stimulus in January. \n",
      "Investors pulled $1.1 billion out of funds that mainly hold safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, marking their biggest weekly outflows since early October. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury topped 3 percent on December 27, marking a two-and-a-half year high. \n",
      "Funds that hold floating-rate bank loans, which are protected from rising interest rates by being pegged to floating-rate benchmarks, attracted just $142.3 million in new cash, marking the weakest turnout for the funds since October 2012. \n",
      "Money market funds, which are low-risk vehicles that invest in short-term securities, attracted about $14 billion in new cash after sizeable inflows of $21.4 billion over the prior week. \n",

      "* Violence fuelled by conflict in neighbouring Syria   (Adds Hezbollah statement) \n",
      "By Oliver Holmes and Stephen Kalin \n",
      "BEIRUT, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A car bomb killed at least five people in Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut on Thursday, the latest in a series of deadly attacks on Shi’ite and Sunni targets in Lebanon. \n",
      "Several other cars were destroyed by the force of the blast, the blackened and twisted wreckage smouldering on the street in front of buildings whose facades were torn off by the explosion. \n",
      "Health Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said five people were killed and 66 wounded. A security source said the blast was caused by a car bomb. \n",
      "People at the scene said that in addition to the five confirmed dead, the charred remains of a body was found on Thursday evening. A security source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the body was that of a suicide bomber. \n",
      "The explosion occurred less than a week after former finance minister Mohamad Chatah, a critic of the Shi’ite Hezbollah militant group and its ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was killed along with six others by a car bomb in Beirut. \n",
      "Last summer, bombs exploded in southern Beirut and outside two Sunni Muslim mosques in the northern city of Tripoli, killing scores of people. Bombers also struck the embassy of Hezbollah’s Iranian backers in southern Beirut in November. \n",
      "The violence has been fuelled by sectarian tensions over the conflict in neighbouring Syria, where Assad is fighting Sunni Muslim rebels battling to overthrow him. Assad is from the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi’ism. \n",
      "Hezbollah has sent fighters to join Assad’s forces, while Lebanese Sunni Muslim fighters have supported the rebels. \n",
      "Clashes broke out in Tripoli on Thursday evening between Lebanese militias who support opposing sides of the Syrian war, a regular occurrence following such bombing in the small Mediterranean country. \n",
      "A women from the Alawite Jebel Mohsen neighbourhood was killed by sniper fire from militants in the Sunni district of Bab al-Tabbaneh, her family said. A further five people were wounded in street battles which included gunfire and explosions, residents said. \n",
      "“(Terrorism) is being directed towards all people. It is being directed to create sectarian strife among Lebanese,” the health minister told reporters. \n",
      "The bomb struck just after 4 p.m. when the streets of southern Beirut’s Haaret Hreik district were packed with rush hour traffic. A Reuters Television cameraman said Hezbollah members fired into the air to disperse people, fearing possible subsequent explosions. \n",
      "Hezbollah’s deputy Sheikh Naim Qassem called for calm and the “quick formation of a national unity cabinet”, after months with a caretaker government in the country following the resignation of the prime minister in March. \n",
      "“Lebanon is on the road to ruin if there is no political understanding,” he told Hezbollah’s al Manar television. \n",
      "There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, which was condemned by both sides of Lebanon’s sectarian divide. It was not clear if a specific person was targeted by the bomb. \n",
      "Foreign Minister Adnan Mansour appealed for international support to curb the violence and cut off financial aid and other support for bombers. \n",
      "“Everyone must work to curb the sources of terrorism. If not, this whirlpool will envelop everyone. Lebanon is suffering, others are suffering, everyone is suffering,” he told Al Arabiya Television.

      "Grenade attack at Kenyan coast wounds 10 -police\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "MOMBASA, Kenya, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A grenade attack on a popular nightclub outside the coastal Kenyan city of Mombasa wounded at least 10 people early on Thursday, police said. \n",
      "The incident occurred at 3:30 am (0030 GMT) at a nightclub frequented by tourists in Diani some 25 km outside Mombasa, they said. It resembled explosions in 2012 and 2013 that were blamed on Somali militants. \n",
      "“The club was busy with New Year revellers. Three people appeared from the other side of the road and threw a grenade at the night club which (the grenade) exploded injuring 10 people. The attackers escaped on a motor bike,” Jack Ekakuro, Kwale area police chief told journalists at the scene. \n",
      "“It cannot be anything else but a terrorist attack. A grenade is a not a maize cob that any village boy can handle and throw around at will.” \n",
      "Ekakuro did not say who was behind the attack, but the government has in the past put the blame on Somalia’s al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgents, who have demanded the withdrawal of Kenyan troops who have joined African peacekeepers fighting the group in Somalia. \n",
      "Kenya’s coast is dependent on tourism and has been plagued by attacks blamed on Islamist militants and their sympathisers. \n",
      "In September, al Shabaab gunmen attacked a attacked a Nairobi shopping mall, killing at least 67 civilians in the country’s worst incident since the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy that killed more than 200 people.

      "World manufacturing ends 2013 on a strong note\n",
      "6 Min Read\n",
      "NEW YORK/LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Global manufacturing ended 2013 on a strong note, as major exporters like the United States, Japan and Germany all saw demand pick up, although China’s performance remained modest, surveys showed on Thursday. \n",
      "Years of loose monetary policy, along with soaring stock markets, appear to be bolstering economic confidence. That bodes well for a global economy that has struggled to shake off the effects of financial crisis and recession. \n",
      "China’s growth rate fell to a three-month low, though the index was still above the 50 mark that indicates expansion. Weakness in global equity markets was blamed in part on the Chinese data, though markets were also taking a breather from recent gains. \n",
      "U.S. manufacturing activity grew in December at its swiftest pace in 11 months and the rate of job growth was the strongest since March, according to Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index. \n",
      "Other U.S. economic figures, including construction spending and the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ survey, also pointed to steady gains in the world’s largest economy. \n",
      "“We have had a whole string of strong ISM numbers. This is a gauge of sentiment and sentiment is improving,” said Scott Brown, chief economist with Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. \n",
      "“Europe has turned the corner. It’s not contracting at least. The emerging markets are doing better. We are looking for growth to pick up once again in the new year and we have few headwinds to deal with, especially less fiscal drag.” \n",
      "The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing PMI index dipped slightly to 57 from 57.3 in November, but that’s still well above the 50 level that indicates growth in the sector. Construction spending rose 1 percent to a four-and-a-half-year high. \n",
      "A Reuters poll of economists taken in mid-December forecasts annualized first-quarter economic growth of 2.5 percent, reaching 3 percent by year-end. Since then, economic data has tended to exceed forecasts. \n",
      "U.S. stock markets have been on a tear, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve eases off on its monthly stimulus. The S&P; 500 benchmark closed at all-time highs on Tuesday, even though equities dipped modestly on Thursday. \n",
      "Factory sentiment hit a 10-month high in Mexico, with the HSBC Mexico Manufacturing PMI rising to 52.6 in December, thanks to improved new orders and output. \n",
      "Euro zone manufacturing grew at the fastest rate since mid- 2011 in December on brisk business in Germany and Italy, Markit Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs) showed. Add in the fastest growth in 7 1/2 years for Japanese manufacturing and no major slowdown in Chinese manufacturing output, and the stage is set for a solid start to the year. \n",
      "“Looking ahead, the hope for the euro zone is that recent improved confidence will encourage businesses to lift their employment and investment plans as 2014 progresses, and will also encourage consumers to spend more,” said Howard Archer, the chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight. \n",
      "Markit’s U.S. manufacturing index rose to 55 in December from a final reading of 54.7 in November, above the 50 threshold that indicates growth. \n",
      "Markit’s euro zone manufacturing PMI rose to 52.7 in December from 51.6 in November. \n",
      "While business is showing signs of life, unemployment in many euro zone countries, particularly among young people, remains high. However, the PMIs showed almost two years of job cuts across euro zone factories nearly ended last month. \n",
      "Manufacturing appears to reviving in several euro zone countries that have struggled since the sovereign debt crisis broke out more than four years ago, with gains in Spain, Ireland and even Greece. \n",
      "In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, manufacturing grew at its fastest pace since mid-2011, with its PMI rising to 54.3 from 52.7. The Dutch posted their fastest rate in more than two years. \n",
      "But the euro zone’s No. 2 economy, France, is still lagging. Its PMI fell sharply to 47.0 from 48.4, a seven-month low, marking faster contraction as the year drew to a close. \n",
      "Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, noted that euro zone manufacturers have begun raising prices, suggesting some strengthening in almost non-existent pricing power. \n",
      "“It seems likely that the manufacturing sector will help drive a meaningful, albeit still modest, recovery in the wider economy,” Williamson said. \n",
      "In Britain, which in the last several months has been outperforming the euro economies, the manufacturing PMI unexpectedly slipped to 57.3 from 58.1. Even so, manufacturing output probably grew by 1 percent in the fourth quarter alone, according to Markit. \n",
      "In Asia, performance was a bit more mixed. Already lackluster output slowed in India, owing mainly to weak domestic demand. But orders from abroad picked up. \n",
      "“The most striking feature of today’s PMIs was the rise in the output component recorded everywhere but India,” wrote Krystal Tan, Asia economist at consultancy Capital Economics. \n",
      "The HSBC/Markit PMI for China slipped to a three-month low of 50.5 in December, consistent with a dip in the official government PMI to a four-month low of 51.0. \n",
      "Capital Economics’ Tan noted that new orders growth in Asia, while not as strong as output, was better for most economies than it was just a few months ago. \n",
      "“This fits with our view that the region’s manufacturing sectors are on a gradual road to recovery, supported by loose monetary policy and strengthening external demand.” \n",
      "The PMIs for South Korea and Indonesia, important emerging economies in Asia, both rose in December but remained at relatively low levels. \n",
      "(This story corrects construction spending rise in paragraph eight) \n",

      "Lufthansa faces weekend strike at Paris airport\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - French unions have called on Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) workers at Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris, to strike from Friday morning to Sunday evening in a dispute over outsourcing ground operations, which could cause flights delays and cancellations. \n",
      "“In the case of a strike Lufthansa flights to and from Paris could be affected,” a spokeswoman for the airline said on Thursday. \n",
      "The strike call came a week after Lufthansa was forced to cancel four flights because most of its workers in Paris called in sick as part of a protest against plans to outsource ground operations at the airport to a third-party provider. \n",
      "The UNSA union, which represents Lufthansa staff in France, has said the move would threaten 199 jobs. \n",
      "“Management remain deaf to the demands of the unions”, the Cfdt, CFTC, UNSA and CFE CGC unions said in a joint statement. \n",
      "“We know full well that, despite 84 percent of staff already declared on strike, Lufthansa France management will succeed in guaranteeing continued service by bringing in substantial numbers of staff from abroad,” the unions said. \n",
      "Lufthansa, like other airlines hit by the economic downturn in Europe and increasing competition from low-cost carriers and Gulf airlines, is in the midst of a cost-cutting program that aims to improve annual operating profit by 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion). \n",
      "Lufthansa, Germany’s flagship carrier, operates 17 daily flights to and from Paris, out of a global total of between 1,700 and 1,800 services. \n",

      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks declined on Thursday as investors opened the year on a cautious note after the S&P; 500 wrapped up its best year since 1997, despite economic data pointing to continued growth in the economy. \n",
      "The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity stood at 57.0 last month, in line with economists’ forecasts but a touch below November’s 2-1/2-year high of 57.3. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. \n",
      "Earlier data showed weekly initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, the second weekly decline in a row, suggesting labor market conditions continue to steadily improve. \n",
      "In another sign of economic improvement, financial data firm Markit said its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 55.0 last month, beating November’s 54.7 reading and an initial December estimate of 54.4. \n",
      "“It’s definitely taking a bit of a breather in looking for the new catalyst, looking for the next investment theme to unfold,” said Anastasia Amoroso, Global Market Strategist with J.P. Morgan Funds in New York. \n",
      "“It’s a slow coming back to life and a slow start to the new year but it’s also important to look past one day of data points and what we think is going to be a continuation of a cyclical expansion in the United States and elsewhere.” \n",
      "The S&P; 500 closed out 2013 with a spectacular 29.6 percent gain for the year, its best annual performance since 1997, adding $3.75 trillion in market value. The Dow  climbed 26.5 percent in its best year since 1995. The Nasdaq  jumped 38.3 percent, its best year since 2009. \n",
      "Other data showed U.S. construction spending increased 1 percent to an annual rate of $934.4 billion, the highest level since March 2009, as a surge in private construction projects offset a drop in public outlays. \n",
      "The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.62 points or 0.53 percent, to 16,488.04, the S&P; 500 lost 10.7 points or 0.58 percent, to 1,837.66 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 30.103 points or 0.72 percent, to 4,146.487. \n",
      "Apple Inc dipped 1.3 percent to $555.59 as the biggest drag on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes after Wells Fargo cut its rating on the iPad maker to “market perform” from “outperform.” The S&P; technology index  fell 1 percent as the worst performing of the 10 major S&P; sectors. \n",
      "In a note to clients, Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup, boosted his year-end 2014 target for the S&P; 500 to 1,975 from 1,900, citing earnings progress as the primary driver. \n",

      "Martha Stewart, Macy's settle lawsuit over Penney deal\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc MSO.N said it settled a lawsuit with retailer Macy’s Inc (M.N) over a home products deal with department store J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N). \n",
      "Martha Stewart did not disclose the terms of the settlement, but said the deal would not be material to the company. \n",
      "Macy’s sued Martha Stewart and Penney in 2012 after the two announced a partnership in 2011 to open Martha Stewart home shops at hundreds of Penney stores. \n",
      "Martha Stewart’s shares rose as much as 12 percent to more than a year high in regular trading on Thursday. The company’s stock has lost about 5 percent of its value since Macy’s filed the lawsuit in January 2012. \n",
      "“The Macy’s lawsuit was an overhang to the Martha Stewart shares; the resolution now allows the company to focus on its reorganization in its publishing division, a key catalyst toward higher stock valuations,” Noble Financial Capital Markets analyst Michael Kupinski said. \n",
      "Kupinski estimates revenue of more than $100 million for Martha Stewart from its Penney deal, which will end in 2017. \n",
      "In December 2011, Martha Stewart struck a deal with Penney under which Stewart would design kitchen, bed and bath products to be sold in shops-within-a-store at larger Penney stores that would anchor a reinvention of the department store by then CEO Ron Johnson. \n",
      "Penney and Martha Stewart revised their agreement in October, eliminating cookware, bedding and bath products, and other merchandise to which Macy’s claims exclusive rights under a 2006 deal. Penney also gave up its 17 percent stake in Stewart’s company. \n",
      "With its broadcast and publishing revenues falling, Martha Stewart has been focusing on boosting its merchandise business. \n",
      "The company’s merchandise revenue grew 7 percent in the quarter ended September 30. \n",
      "The business accounted for about 42 percent of Martha Stewart’s total revenue in the quarter, up from about 30 percent a year earlier. \n",
      "Macy’s also sought to stop Penney from selling any products designed by home improvement doyenne Martha Stewart even if her name doesn’t appear on the items or their marketing. \n",
      "Macy’s said in a separate statement that the Thursday settlement did not affect its outstanding claim against Penney. \n",
      "Martha Stewart’s shares closed up 9 percent at $4.57 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Penney shares closed 3 percent lower at $8.88. Macy’s shares ended flat at $53.39. \n",

      "* Euro hits two-week low vs dollar after strong 2013 \n",

      "* Euro falls after asset quality snapshot \n",
      "By Julie Haviv \n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the euro on Thursday as an array of improving U.S. economic reports supported expectations that the Federal Reserve will gradually scale back its bond purchases. \n",
      "The euro was the strongest-performing major currency in 2013, but historically has tended to weaken at the start of a calendar year. The single currency dropped to a two-week low of $1.3628 before paring losses to last trade 0.6 percent lower at $1.3664. \n",
      "The U.S. dollar hit a high of 105.44 yen, its strongest level versus the Japanese currency since October 2008, before erasing gains to trade down 0.3 percent at 104.94 yen. \n",
      "Japanese financial markets are closed Thursday and Friday for the New Year’s break. \n",
      "The dollar should continue to benefit from an improving U.S. economy. \n",
      "A gauge of U.S. factory activity held near a 2-1/2-year high in December and the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell for a second week last week, pointing to resilience in the economy. \n",
      "Other data on Thursday showed construction spending hit its highest in nearly five years in November. \n",
      "“The U.S. dollar has started the year with strength, and a shift in market dynamics suggests the dollar may continue to gain versus the euro and other counterparts,” said David Rodriguez, quantitative strategist at DailyFX in New York. \n",
      "“Forex volatility prices and rising U.S. Treasury yields keep us focused on dollar gains,” he said. \n",
      "Against a backdrop of a firming jobs market and brightening economic outlook, the Fed said in December it would reduce its monthly $85 billion bond buying program by $10 billion starting in January. \n",
      "Global manufacturing ended 2013 on a strong note, as major exporters like the United States, Japan and Germany all saw demand pick up, although China’s performance remained modest, surveys showed on Thursday. \n",
      "U.S. manufacturing activity grew in December at its swiftest pace in 11 months and the rate of job growth was the strongest since March, according to Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index. \n",
      "Other U.S. economic figures, including construction spending and the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ survey, also pointed to steady gains in the world’s largest economy. \n",
      "A Reuters poll of economists taken in mid-December forecast annualized first-quarter economic growth of 2.5 percent, reaching 3 percent by year-end. Since then, economic data has tended to exceed forecasts. \n",
      "Volumes were low in late December and prices driven by factors such as euro zone banks repatriating funds to shore up their capital bases before the European Central Bank’s year-end review of their assets, which supported the euro. \n",
      "“Last week the market was mainly determined by position rescaling,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of currency research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. \n",
      "“Today is the first day when fundamentals work out again ... That’s why there is pressure on euro/dollar.” \n",
      "While few analysts expect the ECB, which holds a policy meeting next week, to change interest rates in the near future, the Fed is closely monitoring the strength of the U.S. recovery to gauge the pace at which it scales back its bond-buying. \n",
      "“The sensitivity to surprises in data in the euro zone is much lower than the sensitivity to surprises in the data in the U.S.” Leuchtmann said. \n",
      "But it offered little sustained support for the single currency, which was down 1 percent against the yen at 143.38  yen, according to Reuters data. \n",

      "U.S. small businesses borrowed more in November, index shows\n",
      "2 Min Read\n",
      "(Reuters) - U.S. small businesses increased their borrowing in November from a year ago, suggesting continued economic growth ahead even as the Federal Reserve begins to reduce its massive monetary stimulus. \n",
      "The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index, which measures the volume of financing to small companies, rose 1 percent in November from a year earlier, to 111.4, PayNet said on Thursday. \n",
      "November, with just 20 working days, had the highest per-day borrowing rate of 2013, the data showed. \n",
      "“It’s another sign of continued expansion,” PayNet founder Bill Phelan said. Small businesses “are seeing more demand for goods and services, and that’s all good for GDP.” \n",
      "Small companies typically take out loans to buy new tools, factories and equipment, so more borrowing can be an early signal of increased hiring ahead. \n",
      "Historically, PayNet’s lending index has correlated to overall economic growth one or two quarters in the future. \n",
      "The outlook for the job market, and for economic growth more broadly, is crucial as the Fed begins a long-awaited reduction to its bond-buying program and weighs the economy’s tolerance for subsequent cutbacks. \n",
      "In December, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested the bond-buying program could be phased out completely in 2014. \n",
      "A separate index showed small businesses have begun taking on slightly more risk, with delinquencies ticking up marginally from record lows. \n",
      "Delinquencies of 31 to 180 days in November rose to 1.45 percent of all loans made, from 1.44 percent in October, according to the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Delinquency Index. \n",
      "A measure of accounts overdue as a percentage of all loans hit a high of 4.73 percent in August 2009. \n",
      "PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 250 leading U.S. lenders. \n",

      "Scientists, tourists rescued from Antarctic ship begin long journey home\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian icebreaker with 52 passengers rescued from a Russian ship trapped in Antarctic ice since Christmas Eve began the long journey home on Friday. \n",
      "“The passengers seem very glad to now be with us and they are settling in to their new accommodation,” Jason Mundy, Australian Antarctic Division Acting Director who is on board the ice breaker Aurora Australis, said on Friday morning. \n",
      "A helicopter from the Chinese icebreaker Snow Dragon ferried the 52 scientists and tourists in small groups from the ice-bound Akademik Shokalskiy and transferred them to the Antarctic supply ship Aurora Australis late on Thursday. \n",
      "The Aurora Australis is now sailing towards open water and will then head towards an Antarctic base to complete a resupply before returning to Australia. \n",
      "Passengers, mostly Australians and New Zealanders, will probably arrive in Australia’s southern island state of Tasmania around mid-January. The Russian crew on the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay onboard until the ice breaks up and frees the ship. \n",
      "The rescue, repeatedly delayed due to weather and ice conditions, kicked off late on Thursday afternoon and took around five hours to complete. \n",
      "Chris Turney, who led the private expedition, documented the rescue mission from the stranded ship with regular posts depicting videos and photographs. \n",
      "“The first of the helicopters to take us home! Thanks everyone!” Turney and another passenger said cheerfully in a short video clip when the helicopter arrived to take the first group of 12 people. \n",
      "Photographs showed passengers bundled in heavy parka jackets, snow goggles and hats, boarding a helicopter amid a backdrop of snowdrifts and clear blue skies - a big change from the cloud, howling gales and slow flurries that had prevented earlier rescue attempts. \n",
      "“We’ve made it to the Aurora Australis safe & sound,” Turney said on Twitter late on Thursday. \n",
      "Mundy said there were enough rooms on the Aurora Australis for these passengers, and the ship can “look after them well for the final part of their journey”. \n",
      "The Russian-owned research ship left New Zealand on November 28 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of an Antarctic journey led by famed Australian explorer Douglas Mawson. \n",
      "It became trapped on December 24, 100 nautical miles east of French Antarctic station Dumont D’Urville and about 1,500 nautical miles south of Australia’s southern island state of Tasmania. \n",
      "During their time on the ice, passengers amused themselves with movies, classes in knot tying, languages, yoga and photography, and rung in the New Year with dinner, drinks and new song composed about their adventure. \n",
      "The Chinese ship Snow Dragon got within sight of the Akademik Shokalskiy on Saturday, but turned back after failing to break through the ice, which was more than 3 meters (10 feet) thick in some place. \n",
      "The Aurora Australis and another French flagged ship also tried to help but failed to reach the ship because of strong winds and heavy snow. \n",

      "SINGAPORE, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The dollar held steady near a two-week high versus a basket of currencies on Friday after positive U.S. economic data reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to step away from its bond buying stimulus. \n",
      "U.S. factory activity held near a 2-1/2-year high in December and the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell again last week, data showed on Thursday, suggesting the world’s largest economy was on stable footing. \n",
      "Against a backdrop of a firming jobs market and brightening economic outlook, the Fed said in December it would reduce its monthly $85 billion bond buying program by $10 billion starting in January. \n",
      "The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, last stood at 80.607, having risen to as high as 80.709 on Thursday, its strongest level since Dec. 20. \n",

      "The yen also gained some respite versus the euro, which eased 0.1 percent to 143.15 yen, following a 1.2 percent drop on Thursday. The common currency has backed off from a five-year high of 145.67 yen set last Friday. \n",

      "Thursday’s falls in the dollar and the euro versus the yen were likely caused by position squaring in thin liquidity, Okagawa added. \n",
      "Against the dollar, the euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.3658 , staying within sight of a two-week low of about $1.3630 set on Thursday. \n",
      "The drop in the euro came in the wake of its rise to a two-year high of $1.3894 last Friday. \n",

      "Turkish export chief criticises c.bank FX policy\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "ANKARA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Some Turkish firms are losing money because the central bank failed to stabilise the lira currency, the head of an industry body said on Thursday in a sign of exasperation within the business community over authorities’ economic management. \n",
      "“The central bank’s indication of a forex rate level but the failure to subsequently achieve this is causing losses to companies which made transactions trusting in the central bank,” said Mehmet Buyukeksi, chairman of the Turkish Exporters Assembly (TIM), an umbrella group for some 52,000 firms. \n",
      "He was speaking at a news conference to announce TIM’s estimate that Turkish exports totalled $151.71 billion last year, virtually unchanged from 2012, when they jumped about 13 percent. \n",
      "“We in the export camp attach great importance in particular to keeping to a minimum the volatility in forex markets,” Buyukeksi said. \n",
      "In August, central bank governor Erdem Basci said people should not be surprised if the lira ended the year at 1.92 to the U.S. dollar. \n",
      "But because of capital outflows from nervous investors in Turkish bonds, worsened by a high-level corruption scandal that erupted in the government last month, that forecast proved to be way off the mark. \n",
      "The lira ended last year at 2.15, down about 17 percent against the dollar during 2013. It hit a fresh record low of 2.1778 on Thursday. \n",
      "Many foreign portfolio investors in Turkey have blamed the lira’s weakness on the central bank’s unusual monetary policy, which spurns benchmark interest rate hikes - the traditional way to stabilise a currency - in favour of adjustments to money market liquidity. \n",
      "Buyukeksi did not discuss his criticisms of central bank policy in detail, but made clear that he wanted more effective policy this year. \n",
      "“The central bank’s policies for 2014 are of vital importance,” he said, adding that the prospect of reduced U.S. monetary stimulus was making global conditions increasingly difficult, boosting interest rates and making financing tighter for Turkish firms. \n",
      "“Possible capital flight from emerging markets is exerting pressure on the current account deficit and exchange rates. Parallel to this, we are facing higher interest rates in the new period. The period of plenty and cheap liquidity is coming to an end.”\n",

      "SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - Magpul Industries, a manufacturer of ammunition magazines, is moving its corporate headquarters to Texas, making good on its threat to leave its base in Colorado because of new restrictions on guns. \n",
      "“Moving operations to states that support our culture of individual liberties and personal responsibility is important,” Magpul Chief Executive Richard Fitzpatrick said in a statement on Thursday. \n",
      "Magpul threatened last year to leave in response to new state laws that ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds, require universal background checks for gun buyers and force gun buyers to pay for their own background checks. \n",
      "The company, which employs about 250 people in Colorado, will move its corporate headquarters to a yet-to-be determined site in Texas. \n",
      "Most of its jobs will be moved to Wyoming, where manufacturing and distribution will take place, the Denver Post quoted spokesman Duane Liptak as saying. \n",
      "“This relocation will also improve business operations and logistics as we utilize the strengths of Texas and Wyoming in our expansion,” Fitzpatrick said. \n",
      "Colorado has seen two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. \n",
      "The state implemented the new legislation in March 2013, about nine months after a gunman opened fire in a packed theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others. \n",
      "Texas Governor Rick Perry welcomed Magpul to the state, with his office saying Texas has been trying to woo other firearms companies facing restrictive regulations in their home states. \n",

      "Five predictions for financial markets in 2014\n",
      "8 Min Read\n",
      "Happy New Year! For the first time since 2008, we investors, economists and businesspeople say these words without irony. While last year was statistically disappointing, with global growth slowing slightly from 2012 and apparently belying the optimism expressed here last January, the verdict of financial markets and business sentiment has been much more consistent with my predictions. Despite the apparent slowdown, stock markets enjoyed their best performance since the 1990s, long-term interest rates soared and consumer confidence all over the world ended 2013 much higher than it started. This apparent paradox is easily explained: the statistical weakness of 2013 was due entirely to a very weak period last winter, connected with the U.S. presidential election and leadership transition in China. By the second quarter, growth had revived in the U.S. and China and accelerated strongly in Britain and Japan. \n",
      "That conventional wisdom last January was far too pessimistic about the economic outlook is evidenced by the subsequent behavior of financial markets, where equities outperformed bonds by the biggest annual margin on record. But today almost everyone is optimistic. So what unexpected developments could surprise financial markets and business sentiment in 2014? Below are five personal guesses — some possibly far-fetched and others are seemingly obvious, but none yet fully reflected in market prices: \n",
      "1. Four is the new two. \n",
      "I think the U.S. economy will grow by about 4 percent, much faster than the 2.5 to 3 percent predicted by the IMF and mainstream economic forecasts. My reasoning is simple. In the last reported quarter, the U.S. economy was already growing by 4.1 percent and the private sector by 4.9 percent. With U.S. budget battles now over and short-term interest rates firmly anchored at zero, there is no reason to expect a slowdown. If the U.S. accelerates to around 4 percent, so will global growth and 4 percent will replace 2 percent as the growth rate assumed in business and financial planning. Global inflation expectations will also rise to around 3 percent, raising the benchmark for global growth in nominal terms to around 7 percent, very similar to the 10 years before the 2008 financial crisis. In other words, the “new normal” of global stagnation widely predicted after the crisis will turn out to be not very different from the old normal. \n",
      "2. The big financial trends of 2013 still have a long way to go. \n",
      "While the gains of over 20 percent in major stock markets may not be repeated this year, equity prices in most of the world should continue rising -- and bond prices continue falling. Stock market optimism seems justified for two reasons. Wall Street has now decisively broken a 13-year trading range and past experience, as described in this column last March, strongly suggests that this breakout signals the start of a bull market in global equities that will last for many years. Shifting from history to financial fundamentals, the 6 or 7 percent nominal growth I expect in the global economy should translate into similar growth in corporate revenues and earnings. That would imply similar gains in equity prices, even without any increase in price-earnings multiples or leveraging up of corporate balance sheets through stock buybacks. Given that equity valuations are still only slightly above long-term average levels and that companies are flush with cash, there should be scope for considerably stronger gains in many stock markets. \n",
      "The biggest problem for stock markets will be higher interest rates, since 10-year yields will rise to at least 3.5 percent as the U.S. economy accelerates. But history shows that stock market prices usually rise alongside rising bond yields during periods of economic recovery, provided short-term rates remain low. And luckily for equity investors, the Federal Reserve will maintain its commitment to zero short-term interest rates however much the economy accelerates, because Fed officials see rapid growth as a natural and welcome development after five years of deep recession. \n",
      "3. The European crisis will metastasize from economics into politics. \n",
      "Unfortunately European central bankers have a very different worldview. They see rapid growth as a portent of inflation and will start hinting at tighter money as soon as economic conditions improve. The conflict between strong growth and easy money has already appeared in Britain. It will become a major political problem in 2014, because the improvement in economic activity depends entirely on a property boom that the Bank of England is trying (unsuccessfully) to deflate. As a result, sterling will continue to strengthen, central bank independence will come under pressure and the British economy will become ever more unbalanced, generating the world’s biggest trade deficit relative to GDP. In the euro zone, by contrast, economic conditions will remain feeble at least until the summer, when a shift towards more expansionary monetary and fiscal policies will be triggered by panic in Germany about the big victories for fringe nationalist and neo-fascist parties in May’s European elections. As a result, the euro will weaken and the southern European economies will finally start to recover, but not until the second half of the year. \n",
      "4. Japan will shoot itself in the foot — again. \n",
      "Japan is the major economy most likely to disappoint expectations in 2014, making a mockery of the optimism expressed here last year about Abenomics. The consumption tax increase in April will produce a fiscal tightening worth roughly 2 percent of GDP, after allowing for some feeble offsetting measures. As a result, Japan will probably sink back into recession by the second quarter and the stock market will fall sharply, even though the Bank of Japan will try to ramp up its monetary stimulus and the yen will probably weaken even more. \n",
      "5. Emerging markets will make a comeback — perhaps in unlikely places. \n",
      "With the U.S. accelerating to 4 percent and China growing steadily in the 7 to 8 percent range, emerging markets will come into their own as investors realize that most of these economies have more to gain from robust economic conditions and stronger commodity prices than they have to lose from slightly higher interest rates. There will, of course, be exceptions. Financial problems may intensify in countries with large trade deficits or political mismanagement, such as Turkey and perhaps Brazil.  On the other hand, two major economies now treated as pariahs could do surprisingly well. In Russia, the recent release of Mikhail Khodorkovsky could signal a newfound respect for private property rights. And a nuclear deal with Iran could bring this potentially dynamic economy back into the civilized world, as well as transforming Middle East geopolitics. But at this point, I am probably getting too optimistic even for a New Year pipe dream. \n",

      "Preview: Oregon at Utah\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "Fresh off completing a flawless non-conference schedule, ninth-ranked Oregon travels to Utah to take on the Utes in the Pac-12 opener for both teams. The Ducks completed a clean sweep Sunday, turning away Morgan State 97-76 at home. Despite the stellar start, coach Dana Altman sees much that needs improving as conference play begins, saying, “I think every facet of our game. Our list starts with defense and rebounding but offensively, we have to improve too.” \n",
      "Utah fell a game short of also going unbeaten in non-conference play, with its only setback coming in its only road game, 69-67 to Boise State on Dec. 3. The Utes rebounded from that loss to roll off five straight wins, most recently thrashing NAIA school St. Katherine 124-51 on Saturday, and forward Jordan Loveridge says his squad is primed for its biggest test yet. “We’re ready and we want to play a team like (Oregon),” he told the Deseret News. “We want to see where we’re at.” \n",
      "TV: 8 p.m. ET, Pac-12 Network \n",
      "ABOUT OREGON (12-0): The Ducks are the nation’s most prolific offensive squad, averaging 90.8 points and totaling 80 or more in 10 of their 12 games this season. Joseph Young leads the team by averaging 20.2 points, and Mike Moser (13.9), Jason Calliste (12.3) and Damyean Dotson (11.3) all add double-digit averages. Johnathan Loyd, who recently moved into sixth place on the school’s all-time assist list, is 10th in the nation with 6.7 per game. \n",
      "ABOUT UTAH (11-1): Utes coach Larry Krystkowiak is letting his team hit the Pac-12 portion of its schedule with untempered excitement. “I’m not in a position to try to clam anybody down,” he said, adding, “I like a bit of reckless abandon and there’s going to be a lot of uncharted territory with some of the players.” Loveridge leads Utah, averaging 17.3 points and 9.4 rebounds, while Delon Wright adds 14.9 points per game to go with a team-leading 5.9 assists. \n",
      "TIP-INS \n",
      "1. The Ducks lead the series 11-9, including a 64-45 victory in the semifinals of last season’s Pac-12 tournament. \n",
      "2. Utah is off to its best start since an 18-0 run to start the 1997-98 season that culminated in a loss to Kentucky in the national championship game. \n",
      "3. Oregon is 12-0 for the fifth time in school history and a win over Utah would match the Ducks’ best start since 2006-07. \n",

      "FRANKFURT/PARIS, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A rise in December car sales in France, Italy, Belgium and Spain suggested a pick-up in demand in southern Europe, although not enough to avoid a sixth straight annual decline in the overall European market in 2013. \n",

      "Arndt Ellinghorst, automotive analyst at ISI Group, said he was optimistic. \n",
      "“There is strong evidence of a recovery (for European car sales), driven by low financing costs, improved residual values and used car prices and much better fuel economy of new cars.” \n",
      "The surge in French car sales in December was thanks largely to a 38-percent jump in registrations by Renault, data supplied by industry association CCFA shows. \n",

      "However, even a return to sluggish growth will do little to alleviate chronic excess capacity, industry officials warn. \n",

      "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - World share markets kicked off 2014 with a whimper on Thursday, weighed down by disappointing Chinese manufacturing data, with oil prices also lower as Libya prepares to reopen a major oilfield. \n",
      "After their best run in 15 years, U.S. markets fell in early trading, with major indexes posting their largest daily drops in three weeks. \n",
      "The U.S. dollar, however, was having its biggest daily rally in five months against a basket of major currencies as jobs, housing and manufacturing data gave support to the Federal Reserve’s decision to start slowing its stimulus program this month. \n",

      "“There was a sequential decline in the (Chinese) PMI number, so that knocked down indexes a bit.

      "“It’s a slow start to the new year but it’s also important to look past one day of data points and what we think is going to be a continuation of a cyclical expansion in the United States and elsewhere.” \n",
      "The Dow Jones industrial average fell 87.23 points, or 0.53 percent, at 16,489.43. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 11.12 points, or 0.60 percent, at 1,837.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 28.04 points, or 0.67 percent, at 4,148.56. \n",

      "Wild stop losing streak, top Sabres\n",
      "5 Min Read\n",
      "Wild stop losing streak, top Sabres \n",
      "SAINT PAUL, Minn. — Much is made of the notion that you can start over in the New Year. For the Minnesota Wild, flipping the calendar over to 2014 seems to have made a difference, at least initially. \n",
      "After a nightmarish end to 2013, the Wild began the New Year on a better note, getting 19 saves from goaltender Niklas Backstrom in a 4-1 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday to snap a franchise record six-game losing streak. \n",
      "Defenseman Marco Scandella, right winger Jason Pominville and left winger Jason Zucker scored for the Wild (21-17-5) in the second period, and Backstrom, who had lost his previous eight starts, improved to 3-9-2 for the season. \n",
      "“We’re undefeated this year, so it’s all good,” quipped Wild defenseman Clayton Stoner, in a Minnesota locker room that was up-beat jovial after weeks of gloom and doom. \n",
      "Buffalo (11-26-4) got 28 saves from goalie Ryan Miller and a goal by left winger Matt Ellis with 82 seconds left in the game to break up the shutout. The Sabres are winners of a league-low three road games this season. \n",
      "“It wasn’t a strong effort. We didn’t have any zone time at all,” said Miller, who fell to 10-18-1. “They kind of picked us apart in the neutral zone in the second period. The first was all right, then the second was a tough period and the third period was just a wash trying to keep the lead.” \n",
      "After a scoreless first period, the Wild broke the game open in the second with a trio of goals. Scandella opened with a snap shot just under five minutes in, netting just his second goal of the season after a near-perfect set-up pass from left winger Matt Cooke. \n",
      "Less than two minutes later, Pominville doubled Minnesota’s lead, snapping off a low shot that beat Miller on the glove side. It was the second goal Pominville scored in as many games against his former team. Pominville played 588 games with Buffalo over the course of nine seasons before being traded to the Wild in March of last season. \n",
      "“If you look at it, we didn’t do anything special but we did all the little things right,” Pominville said. “That led to us out-shooting them and for the most part out-playing them.” \n",
      "Zucker made it 3-0 Minnesota at 16:09 of the second when he gloved a clearing attempt at center ice, set the puck down and then blasted past Miller’s glove hand. For Zucker, recalled from the minors by the Wild earlier in the day, it was his first NHL goal of the season. \n",
      "“It’s just one of those things where when we’re bad, we’re bad,” said Sabres coach Ted Nolan, admitting he didn’t talk to the team after the second period. “We keep telling the team over and over again that we have to play a simple game, we have to go north and south. We expect a lot from certain guys and they just didn’t deliver.” \n",
      "Ellis scored for the Sabres during a scramble in front of Backstrom with 1:12 to play, but Minnesota was awarded an empty net goal in the final minute when center Kyle Brodziak was pulled down from behind en route to the goal. It was Brodziak’s first goal of the season. \n",
      "“We needed that for sure, but we did it the right way, which is big,” said Wild coach Mike Yeo, who is widely rumored to be on the hot seat due to the team’s recent struggles. “That’s what we said after last game, that we have to take some of the things that we did and improve on some of the things that we weren’t quite good enough at. But pretty complete game tonight.” \n",
      "NOTES: Sabres C Cody Hodgson, who injured his left wrist and a finger on Dec. 19 while blocking a shot in a game against the Boston Bruins, was placed on injured reserve Wednesday. In his place, Buffalo recalled LW Johan Larsson and D Brayden McNabb. Larsson played one game for the Wild last season before being traded to Buffalo as part of the package that brought RW Jason Pominville to Minnesota. ... On Thursday, the Wild placed C Zenon Konopka on waivers. In 36 games for Minnesota this season, the renowned fighter has two points and 55 penalty minutes. The Wild are expected to send him to their AHL affiliate in Iowa if he clears waivers. ... Sabres RW Drew Stafford suffered an upper-body injury in the first period. He left the game and did not return. Buffalo coach Ted Nolan said after the game that the injury was “not a day-to-day thing.”... The Wild complete their current four-game homestand on Saturday when the Washington Capitals make their only trip of the season to Minnesota. The Sabres are at home for their next three games, starting Saturday when the New Jersey Devils visit Buffalo.\n",

      "Lawyer fined for revealing pseudonymous author was JK Rowling\n",
      "3 Min Read\n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A lawyer who blew JK Rowling’s cover when she wrote a detective novel under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith has been fined 1,000 pounds ($1,650) and received a written warning from a British legal watchdog. \n",
      "Chris Gossage, a partner at Russells Solicitors, which represented the Harry Potter author, leaked one of the publishing world’s biggest secrets to his wife’s best friend - who then tweeted Galbraith’s real identity to a journalist. \n",
      "Rowling, Britain’s best-selling author, was furious when she found out that a partner at her London-based law firm had revealed she was the author of “The Cuckoo’s Calling”. \n",
      "Publicity material for the book had described it as the debut novel of retired military policeman Galbraith. \n",
      "After taking legal action against Gossage and his friend Judith Callegari, Rowling accepted an apology from the law firm which paid her legal costs and made a substantial, undisclosed donation to a charity of her choice, the Soldiers’ Charity. \n",
      "The Solicitors Regulation Authority said in a ruling released this week that Gossage had also received a written rebuke and was ordered to pay a 1,000 pound fine for disclosing confidential information about a client to a third party. \n",
      "No one from Russells Solicitors was immediately available to comment. Gossage was still listed as a partner at the firm that made it clear that unmasking Rowling was an error and not a marketing stunt. \n",
      "At the time, Rowling, 48, said it had been “wonderful” to publish without hype or expectation and to get feedback under a different name even if that meant some publishers rejected her work as they had when she first touted her Harry Potter books. \n",
      "The novel was released last April to strong reviews but minimal sales. Once her involvement was known, sales rocketed, sending the novel to the top of best-seller lists. \n",
      "“I feel very angry that my trust turned out to be misplaced,” Rowling said in a statement in July. “To say that I am disappointed is an understatement.” \n",
      "The novel, about a war veteran turned private eye investigating the death of a model, was published by Little, Brown, which in 2012 published Rowling’s first adult novel “The Casual Vacancy”.   (Reporting by Belinda Goldsmith; Editing by Catherine Evans)\n",

      "Car bomb kills at least five in Hezbollah district of Beirut\n",
      "4 Min Read\n",
      "BEIRUT (Reuters) - A car bomb killed at least five people in Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut on Thursday, the latest in a series of deadly attacks on Shi’ite and Sunni targets in Lebanon. \n",
      "Several other cars were destroyed by the force of the blast, the blackened and twisted wreckage smoldering on the street in front of buildings whose facades were torn off by the explosion. \n",
      "Health Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said five people were killed and 66 wounded. A security source said the blast was caused by a car bomb. \n",
      "People at the scene said that in addition to the five confirmed dead, the charred remains of a body was found on Thursday evening. A security source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the body was that of a suicide bomber. \n",
      "The explosion occurred less than a week after former finance minister Mohamad Chatah, a critic of the Shi’ite Hezbollah militant group and its ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was killed along with six others by a car bomb in Beirut. \n",
      "Last summer, bombs exploded in southern Beirut and outside two Sunni Muslim mosques in the northern city of Tripoli, killing scores of people. Bombers also struck the embassy of Hezbollah’s Iranian backers in southern Beirut in November. \n",
      "The violence has been fuelled by sectarian tensions over the conflict in neighboring Syria, where Assad is fighting Sunni Muslim rebels battling to overthrow him. Assad is from the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi’ism. \n",
      "Hezbollah has sent fighters to join Assad’s forces, while Lebanese Sunni Muslim fighters have supported the rebels. \n",
      "Clashes broke out in Tripoli on Thursday evening between Lebanese militias who support opposing sides of the Syrian war, a regular occurrence following such bombing in the small Mediterranean country. \n",
      "A women from the Alawite Jebel Mohsen neighborhood was killed by sniper fire from militants in the Sunni district of Bab al-Tabbaneh, her family said. A further five people were wounded in street battles which included gunfire and explosions, residents said. \n",
      "“(Terrorism) is being directed towards all people. It is being directed to create sectarian strife among Lebanese,” the health minister told reporters. \n",
      "The bomb struck just after 4 p.m. when the streets of southern Beirut’s Haaret Hreik district were packed with rush hour traffic. A Reuters Television cameraman said Hezbollah members fired into the air to disperse people, fearing possible subsequent explosions. \n",
      "Hezbollah’s deputy Sheikh Naim Qassem called for calm and the “quick formation of a national unity cabinet”, after months with a caretaker government in the country following the resignation of the prime minister in March. \n",
      "“Lebanon is on the road to ruin if there is no political understanding,” he told Hezbollah’s al Manar television. \n",
      "There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, which was condemned by both sides of Lebanon’s sectarian divide. It was not clear if a specific person was targeted by the bomb. \n",
      "Foreign Minister Adnan Mansour appealed for international support to curb the violence and cut off financial aid and other support for bombers. \n",
      "“Everyone must work to curb the sources of terrorism. If not, this whirlpool will envelop everyone. Lebanon is suffering, others are suffering, everyone is suffering,” he told Al Arabiya Television. \n",

      "FRANKFURT, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Trading volumes on the Eurex derivatives exchange in 2013 were down 7 percent year on year, with a little more than 1.5 billion contracts, Deutsche Boerse  said on Thursday. \n",

      "The furious partisan debate that erupted this week after a New York Times investigation questioned the central tenet of the Republican assault on the White House regarding Benghazi was a fitting end to 2013. \n",
      "The lengthy article revealed that the State Department and CIA’s intense focus on al Qaeda caused officials to miss the threat posed by local militias. David Kirkpatrick’s reporting showed that Libya’s rebels appreciated the U.S. support in helping oust Muammar Gaddafi, but were strongly influenced by decades of anger at Washington’s support for dictators in the region. \n",
      "Militants gained strength from Syria to the Sahel over the course of 2013. Republicans and Democrats, however, remained focused on winning their daily messaging battle in Washington. \n",
      "Neither the American left nor the right has offered a serious strategy for how to respond to the emergence of new types of militant groups across the Middle East. President Barack Obama’s approach consisted of trusting unchecked CIA drone strikes and NSA eavesdropping to secure the United States. Republicans used the region’s instability as a cudgel to beat the president with. \n",
      "Here are three of 2013’s most troubling developments in the Middle East — and Washington’s perfunctory responses that were a disservice to all Americans. \n",
      "BENGHAZI’S MEANING: As Amy Davidson correctly noted in the New Yorker this week, Washington’s response to months of investigation on the ground in Libya and Egypt by Times reporters Kirkpatrick, Suliman Ali Zway, Osama Alfitori and Mayy El Sheikh quickly devolved into a useless debate over the term “al Qaeda.” \n",
      "Representative Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) -- eager to undermine Obama administration statements that core al Qaeda has been weakened -- insisted that the group involved in the attack “claims an affiliation with al Qaeda,” as if that was the same as an actual relationship with core al Qaeda's remaining leaders. \n",
      "Fox News commentator and Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer dismissed the story as an effort “to protect Hillary [Clinton].” Fox News terrorism analyst Walid Phares absurdly argued that Kirkpatrick was “known to side with Islamists.” \n",
      "The broad message from the left, meanwhile, was that the United States only makes things worse in the Middle East when it acts there. On MSNBC, Karen Finney said the story exonerated the Obama administration because it found that a fake Hollywood video mocking the Prophet Mohammad did, in fact, help spark the attack. \n",
      "Isolationists on the left and the right argued that any military action — particularly one carried out by the United States — was destructive. \n",
      "What was lost when each side cherry-picked conclusions that fit their worldview? The Libyan people’s increasing hatred of militias, both jihadist and tribal groups. In November, Libyans outraged by rising lawlessness drove militias out of Tripoli. Libya’s weak central government, however, lacks the properly trained security forces needed to assert control. \n",
      "Libya’s first democratically-elected prime minister -- a pro-Western moderate -- asked in June for American and NATO forces to help train government security forces. Washington’s response? After five months of talk, the United States agreed in November to train 6,000 to 8,000 Libyan soldiers at a military base in Bulgaria. This paltry effort will not be nearly enough to aid Libyans who oppose militancy. \n",
      "U.S. and NATO military forces should not enter Libya — a move we know from past experience will strengthen jihadists there. But a far larger training effort should be mounted outside Libya. \n",
      "THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD: In 2013, the biggest gamble in the region was the Egyptian army’s decision in July to violently crush the Muslim Brotherhood and remove that nation’s first democratically elected president. The military-dominated government seems to announce each week a new crackdown on the Brotherhood and other critics. But it is not clear that the use of force is working. \n",
      "The Egyptian military campaign against the Brotherhood has now killed more people than the Iranian government’s 2009 crushing of the “Green Revolution.” Yet Cairo has failed to stop regular demonstrations by the Brotherhood. It has also failed to halt a series of car bombings by Islamic extremist groups that are urging Brotherhood members to take up arms. \n",
      "The stakes in Egypt are enormous. The crackdown could succeed — or drive tens of thousands (possibly hundreds of thousands) of conservative activists into the arms of al Qaeda. Republican and Democrats’ reaction to these developments? Collective silence. \n",
      "The Obama administration should suspend all U.S. military aid to Egypt and stop embracing the Saudi fantasy that autocrats are the region’s low-risk, cure-all. Over the long-term, autocrats foster instability and economic stagnation — not stability — in the Middle East. \n",
      "SYRIA: 2013 will be viewed as the year that President Bashar al-Assad turned the tide in the war in Syria. As Adam Entous and Siobhan Gorman detailed in a Wall Street Journal story this week, “all-in” military support from Iran and Hezbollah allowed Assad to retake crucial territory. \n",
      "The Obama administration, however, blinked. \n",
      "Obama had vowed to punish Assad for any chemical weapons attacks. Yet the president held off on air strikes or fully arming the rebels, citing fears of getting embroiled in another Mideast conflict. \n",
      "The result is a conflict in Syria that could drag on for years. Assad can hold much of the country, but not all of it. \n",
      "Jihadists, meanwhile, are taking control of the opposition. Thousands of militants from Iraq, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia have flocked to Syria. An estimated 1,500 to 2,000 European citizens and dozens of American citizens have joined the fight there as well. An unknown number are being radicalized. \n",
      "Some of these jihadists will likely return home, as it becomes clear that Assad will not be toppled in 2014. The Obama administration is gambling that CIA drone strikes and NSA surveillance will somehow hold them at bay. \n",
      "More likely, the blowback from Syria will resemble that of the 1980s anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. Jihadists from that conflict sparked a decade-long civil war in Algeria that killed 50,000 — and, of course, carried out the 9/11 attacks. \n",
      "The Obama administration’s only remaining leverage in Syria is its economic sanctions on Iran, Assad’s primary military backer. Any nuclear agreement with Iran that involves a reduction in economic sanctions should include Iranian support for a peace settlement in Syria. \n",
      "The chances of Washington agreeing on such a strategy are low. Our political elite was so deeply divided in 2013 that we could not define a common enemy. We turned a blind eye to the revival of Mideast authoritarianism. And we fashioned no plans for how to respond to Syria becoming a new Afghanistan. \n",
      "The damage that Washington’s partisanship wrought on domestic affairs in 2013 was chronicled daily in the media. Its destructive impact on the Middle East — and our national security — will emerge for years to come. \n",

      "By Marius Zaharia \n",
      "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Prices of German Bund futures fell to their lowest since September 2013 on Thursday as investors dumped top-rated bonds in favour of riskier assets, betting on a further pick-up in global economic growth in 2014. \n",
      "Top-rated government bonds saw a dismal end to last year as the economic outlook improved and the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would start trimming its bond-buying stimulus programme in 2014. \n",
      "Investors will have euro zone and U.S. business surveys, as well as U.S. jobless claims data to scour later in the day and see if their growth expectations for 2014 are justified. \n",
      "Bund futures were last 37 ticks lower at 138.80, having hit their lowest since September 2013 at 138.68 minutes after the market opened. Cash 10-year Bund yields  rose 3.7 basis points to 1.964 percent. \n",
      "“Bunds are under pressure ... on the back of still strong risk sentiment. We expect (the economic data) to offer further positive news,” Commerzbank strategist Michael Leister said. \n",
      "“But we think at current levels around 2 percent the potential for a further rise is rather limited.” \n",
      "Traders expected volumes to be low and exacerbate market moves as many investors were still on holidays. \n",
      "Stubbornly low inflation in the euro zone and other major economies as well as promises by the Fed and the European Central Bank to keep interest rates low for a long period are expected to cap German and U.S. yields. \n",
      "Some analysts still expect the ECB to ease monetary policy further, especially if falling excess liquidity levels in the banking system keeps money market rates elevated. \n",
      "Eonia, the overnight euro zone bank-to-bank lending rate ended 2013 at a two-year high of 0.446 percent due to seasonally thin liquidity. Analysts expected it to fall in coming days, but the extent of the fall could spark some speculation about further ECB monetary policy easing. \n",
      "DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk does not expect the ECB to make any move in the near term, but says the central bank will continue to strike a soft tone, leading to a widening of the yield gap between Bunds and U.S. Treasuries. \n",
      "“We can expect a further widening of the transatlantic spread. The Fed will be less dovish as it starts tapering and the ECB most likely will remain pretty friendly,” he said. \n",
      "The Bund/T-note yield spread last traded at 107 bps. \n",

      "Altogether debt sales fell 15.1 percent to $311.8 billion from the prior year, as rising interest rates brought the refunding trend to a grinding halt. Preliminary Thomson Reuters data released last week had estimated total issuance for the year at $311.7 billion. \n",
      "BofA underwrote $45 billion of bonds sold by states, cities and authorities, representing 14 percent of the market. It was also top underwriter in 2012. J.P. Morgan Securities  followed at $38.5 billion, or 12.4 percent of the market. \n",
      "California issued the most municipal debt in 2013, $8.45 billion, followed by New York City at $5.4 billion. New York State Dormitory Authority had been the top issuer in 2012, but fell to eighth place last year. \n",
      "Negotiated sales continued to dominate the market, totaling $242.41 billion last year. But they shrank 17.3 percent from 2012. Competitive sales also fell, by 6.4 percent, to $69.36 billion.\n",

      "Historically, equities have enjoyed gains in early January as investors put on bets for the year ahead, and this time sentiment has been further cheered by the strong gains enjoyed over 2013. \n",
      "Such flows outweighed the news that China’s factory activity slowed in December, which raised concern about the strength of demand in the world’s second biggest economy. \n",
      "“We are going into the year on a little bit of a mixed picture in terms of macro data, but in terms of sentiment it’s still strong in equity markets and ...January is normally a very strong month, you always see very strong bids in the market this time of year,” said Peter Garnry, equity strategist at Saxo Bank. \n",
      "“It has been quite an incredible rally and at some point I think we will need to see a correction, but it probably won’t be in January.” \n",
